<ICE-HK:S1A-008#1:1:A>
The Arts students take different courses uh <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
each year and the combination can be totally different from one student to
another so uhm <,> we only have a few uh one or two foreigners uh to take uh
<,> some courses <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> together and other uh uh just <.> indi
</.> individual

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#2:1:A>
Uhm so uh we met not very often <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#3:1:A>
And <,> in fact there is not <.> man </.> there are not many uh
foreigner students in the Arts Faculty <,,> because maybe mainly uhm the
reason is uh I major in <,> English <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> and foreign students
uh who come to Hong Kong may not uh major in English at all

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#4:1:A>
They would uh they would choose other <,> subjects to to be their
major subject

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X5:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X6:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X7:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X8:1:Z>
<[4> Uh uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X9:1:Z>
Do do you know that there <,> there used to be an organization
called the International Outlook which is uh <{1> <[1> <,> for </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X10:1:Z>
Yeah which is sort of uh organization for the foreign students in
<,> University of Hong Kong but they also uh encourage uh participation by
the local students uh <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> so that the local students can
interact with the <,> foreign students and maybe to exchange uh <,> stories
or uh uh maybe to uh gain uh cultural experiences from one another <{3> <[3>
<,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X11:1:Z>
But <,> I think it has already been uh disbanded uh since last
year because uh I think no one wants to <,> take the post <&> laughter </&>
of the exco also <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> it it sort of exists in a <,> <.> s </.>
semi-formal way where some people would just take the initiative to <,> uh
have a gathering uh but it is no longer under the uh <,> University of Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X12:1:Z>
It  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X13:1:Z>
I don't think it  ' s <,> it is ex

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X14:1:Z>
I think it  ' s non existent any uh right now uh <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X15:1:Z>
Non-existent </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#16:1:A>
<[1> International </[1> </{1> Outlook

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#17:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#18:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#19:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#20:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#21:1:A>
How <.> man </.> <.> meh </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#22:1:A>
How <.> man </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#23:1:A>
How many members are there in in the organization

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X24:1:Z>
Uh it depends on the <,> depends on the uh number of foreign
students that come to Hong Kong each year actually <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X25:1:Z>
But there used to be uh call exco so <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> what they
would do is uh <,> they would cooperate with the Office of Student Affairs
and they gave the list of the overseas students and uh then they would send
letters and <,> usually they would try to have a first gathering so uh all of
them will be introduced to one another <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X26:1:Z>
And uh so the the foreign students will know who are the foreign
students in the campus <,> so they can uh communicate with one another and uh
but later you will saw that <,> at the same time they should also welcome the
local students and <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X27:1:Z>
Uh so so <,> uh they had some uh student exchange program where uh
they pair up uh a foreign student with a local student uh <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X28:1:Z>
Uh it it was quite successful to a certain extent uh but <,> uh
after a while I think uh maybe <unc> four words </unc> so much
<unc> one-word </unc> exco so <,> nobody was willing to succeed the
the present exco uh <,> so in the end uh <,> I think there are no one

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X29:1:Z>
No one wants to take over so <,> it becomes uh non-existent </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#30:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#31:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#32:1:A>
<[3> Uh uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#33:1:A>
<[4> Uh uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#34:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#35:1:A>
How many exco members should there be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X36:1:Z>
Uh <,,> there were one chairman uh General Secretary <{1> <[1>
Financial </[1> Secretary uh Publicity Secretary and uh <,> and there are
some a few representatives from the Hall so it  ' s like <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X37:1:Z>
From the Hall it  ' s like each Hall would have a representative
<{3> <[3> and </[3> if they  ' re going to organize a function so the <,>
representative will write something on the board <{4> <[4> <,> you </[4> know
informing all the uh foreign students <{5> <[5> in </[5> the Hall so <,> that  ' s
how that  ' s how the network works uh <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X38:1:Z>
Uh that  ' s how the network works <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X39:1:Z>
<{7> <[7> The </[7> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#40:1:A>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#41:1:A>
<[2> From the Hall </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#42:1:A>
<[3> Uh uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#43:1:A>
<[4> Uh uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#44:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#45:1:A>
<[6> Uh uh </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#46:1:A>
<[7> Who </[7> </{7> is the representative from this Hall

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X47:1:Z>
I was

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X48:1:Z>
I was the <{1> <[1> Hall representative </[1> uh with uh <?>
Rijitha </?> as well <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X49:1:Z>
But uh <,> they had we organize some trips uh like usually the
first uh activity will be <,> a gathering at the main campus and then we  ' ll
<,> take a bus up to the peak

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X50:1:Z>
We  ' ll take <{3> <[3> a tram </[3> to the peak Victoria Peak

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X51:1:Z>
And then we would uh introduce ourselves and <,> following that uh
it depends on where you want to go

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X52:1:Z>
Some people who likes the bar scene they would go to Lan Kwai Fong
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X53:1:Z>
Then those who are relatively uh <,,> mild or not so not not not
so much for the fast life they will go for a drink somewhere or just for
supper <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X54:1:Z>
And they also were quite <,> uh initiative in <,> uh organizing
activities like junk trip

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X55:1:Z>
They rent a junk <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> a boat then they I think they
sailed to Lamma Island once then had some barbecue and a Christmas party <{7>
<[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X56:1:Z>
Yeah but <,> I didn't manage to join many of the activities <{8>
<[8> because I </[8> was quite busy with my <{9> <[9> studies </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X57:1:Z>
So in the end uh <,,> I tried to go <.> whenev </.> whenever I can
uh but unfortunately uh I think time was uh was uh a limiting factor for me
<{10> <[10> so </[10> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X58:1:Z>
But <.> i </.> it was quite a good experience and as I think you
would know that uh <,,> a lot of the foreigners will come to Hong Kong for a
short while <{11> <[11> <,> for </[11> studies <unc> two-words </unc>
three months exchange and <{> <[12> <,> </[12> they  ' ll leave uh but I was
quite surprise a lot of <,> uh foreigners from all over the world

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X59:1:Z>
We have foreigners from uh Tunisia or <.> As </.> somewhere in
Africa <{13> <[13> <,> </[13> then you have uh from uh maybe in the Middle
East we have someone from Turkey <,> and uh from Japan and <,> a lot would a
lot come came from uh Canada <,> uh some Singaporean Malaysian and uh <,>
some from the Scandinavian countries as well like Finland <{14> <[14> uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X89:1:Z>
Uhm I  ' m not I  ' m not too sure about that actually </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#90:1:A>
Because many Old Halls guys uhm uh know him well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X91:1:Z>
Oh I see </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#92:1:A>
Uh my my elder brother is <.> al </.> was also a Hysanian <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1> and he left here for two uh two years <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and
he formerly lived <,> uh in <,> on the thirteenth floor <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>
and Tron uh was his floormate <{> <[4> <,> yeah </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X94:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X95:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X96:1:Z>
<[3> Uh uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X97:1:Z>
<[4> Uh uh I see </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X98:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X99:1:Z>
Have you been to any uh overseas country before </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#100:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#101:1:A>
In fact I haven't been to any overseas country except uh to uh
mainland China <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#102:1:A>
I made a trip to uhm Beijing and Huangzhou <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> uh
when I was uhm <,,> in <,> first year <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#103:1:A>
And uh <,> and then no I haven't gone to any places

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#104:1:A>
But maybe I will make a trip uh after the final examination in May
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#105:1:A>
But it all depends because uhm <,> it  ' s quite difficult for us to
find a job <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> after graduation <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#106:1:A>
Uhm perhaps I may uh settle down in job <,> searching <{7> <[7>
<,> </[7> and then uh go make a short trip because uhm <,> my mother like to
go to Thailand <,> <{8> <[8> so <,> yeah </[8> maybe I  ' ll I go with her uhm
and other friends

<$Z> <X>

<[8> Thailand I see uh uh </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X115:1:Z>
Is is there any <,> particular reason why your mother likes
Thailand <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X116:1:Z>
Or are you uh have Thai origin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#117:1:A>
No <&> Both laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#118:1:A>
She is uh one hundred percent Chinese <&> Both laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#119:1:A>
But maybe uhm she <,,> maybe you can call her a Buddhist <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#120:1:A>
So uh she  ' d like to go there to visit temples <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
and Bangkok

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#121:1:A>
Uh however she doesn't like uh beaches <{3> <[3> <&> laughter </&>
</[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#122:1:A>
Yeah uh it all depends <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#123:1:A>
Uh for the uh for the older generation they like to go to visit
temples uhm everywhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#124:1:A>
Uhm she she always join with her friends to visit temples in China
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4> somewhere near Hong Kong and have uh uhm <,,> dinner
there and uh maybe uhm just return to Hong Kong that night or stay for one
night only

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X125:1:Z>
<[1> Oh I see </[1> </{1>

</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X136:1:Z>

grand

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X137:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#139:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{> 2

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#140:1:A>
Have you tried any vegetarian food in the high table dinner

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X141:1:Z>
Uh no actually I  ' m I I also like to eat meat <{1> <[1> <,> so
</[1> uh <,> usually I  ' m not so keen to take uh vegetarian food uh unless I
know that the place offers very good vegetarian food then only I  ' m willing
to try <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X142:1:Z>
And usually I will ask my friend beforehand uh <,> whether that
place or the particular restaurant is offers really good vegetarian food <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3> so I knew that uh my friend told me that the <,> vegetarian
food in Lantau Island was very good so I <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> I was willing to
try and uh I found it to be really good <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X143:1:Z>
Uh do do you try uh vegetarian food before </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#144:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#149:1:A>
Yeah but not often

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#150:1:A>
I usually accompany my mother to uhm to temples and and try them
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#151:1:A>
But uhm when I go out and and have dinner I seldom choose to have
vegetarian food <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<[1> Western </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#169:1:A>
Uh steaks <,> not not so much preference on that because uhm <,,>
it  ' s easy to get fat <&> laugh </&> <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#170:1:A>
Uh for uh French fries uhm hamburgers and and many <{2> <[2>
others </[2> I think uhm it  ' s I don't know how to say in in English <indig>
<unc> two words </unc> </indig>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X171:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

one-word </unc> or something like <{1> <[1> that </[1> </X>

When I when I get sick with that uhm <,> I just wonder how can I
tell a foreign doctor <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> that I feel I feel that <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#177:1:A>
Because when you have the big uh booking with uhm <,> uh the
clinic <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> the University Clinic <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> uhm the
Chinese doctor are <.> alway </.> always fully booked <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> so
uh sometimes in uh if <,> we are in urgent case <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> we have
to uh make appointment with the a foreign doctor <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#178:1:A>

that I feel that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X179:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X182:1:Z>
<[4> Uh uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X183:1:Z>
<[5> Uh uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X184:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X185:1:Z>
<[7> Uh uh </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X186:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X189:1:Z>
Well that might be <{1> <[1> a problem </[1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#190:1:A>
<[1> There </[1> </{1> there always no <,> no nurse <{1> <[1>

</[1> uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#194:1:A>

</.> to describe <,,> <{1> <[1> uh yeah </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X208:1:Z>
Because I come from Malaysia you see <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so uh
<,,> when I  ' m when I  ' m young uh my diet is uhm is composed of uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X209:1:Z>
I don't just eat uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X210:1:Z>
I mean I don't just eat Chinese food uh <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
because we in Malaysia we we we we have three <.> ma </.> three major races

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X211:1:Z>
We have the Malay Indian and Chinese uh <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

So basically we are living together and uh and maybe we are we we
eat each other  ' s uh food you see <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X213:1:Z>
So uh from young I am used to eating all the Malay food and
Indian food and uh Chinese food uh so uh I I really like to eat uh <.> s </.>
spicy hot curry uh so so <.> whenev </.> whenever in Hong Kong I I find that
sometimes the food here is not hot enough for me <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> so I
have to <,> I have to go to a a <{6> <[6> Malaysian restaurant or </[6>
Indian restaurant

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X214:1:Z>
Uh maybe once every two weeks to to uh satisfy my my yeah my my
need uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#215:1:A>

me <{2> <[2> because that  ' s </[2> his diet uh everyday so <,> uh <,,> so we
we usually I go to all those places with him <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> and maybe

into medical school in Singapore is quite difficult <{6> <[6> so </[6> uh to
be on the safe side I applied to many places <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and Hong
Kong was one of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X314:1:Z>
And I didn't really <,,> thought that I would I would I would end
up studying here really <{8> <[8> <,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X315:1:Z>
So it  ' s like I thought that I  ' ll always get a place in
Singapore but uh when I got rejected then it  ' s like I started to consider
other options uh and then uh <,> Hong Kong was uh one of the options which I
which I <.> thac </.> which I thought was was quite uh was quite good uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#316:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#317:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#318:1:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#319:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#320:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#321:1:A>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#322:1:A>
<[7> Uhm uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#323:1:A>
<[8> Uhm uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#324:1:A>
Did you consider about uhm America England or Canada

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X325:1:Z>
Yeah I applied to some of the universities there but uh <,> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#326:1:A>
They are very popular for Hong Kong students

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X327:1:Z>
Yeah but the main reason why I I didn't want to go there is
because of the financial <,> because if you want to study medicine in uh <,>
in the UK or in <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> Australia is very very expensive uh <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> it  ' s very very expensive uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X328:1:Z>
So uh <,,> and Hong Kong has a good uh medical uh school here
<{3> <[3> and uh </[3> the fees are <.> rel </.> relatively cheaper so I
think <.> i </.> it  ' s it  ' s better for me

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X329:1:Z>
If I were to choose to study in UK uh or Australia uh <,>
probably my father cannot afford it uh <&> laughter </&> so I I come here
yeah yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#330:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#331:1:A>
<[2> Uh uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#332:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#333:1:A>
But the composition fee is uh is raising <,,> <{1> <[1> every
</[1> year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X334:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> yeah but you  ' ll be surprised that <,,> uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X335:1:Z>
You  ' ll be surprised that the fees of UK which which is it can be
really high

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X336:1:Z>
Let  ' s say uh <,> if I were to study uh five years in Hong Kong
uh my fees may only be <,> maybe less about three hundred thousand or or
maybe <{1> <[1> two </[1> hundred thousand uh <{2> <[2> Hong </[2> Kong you
see

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X337:1:Z>
But if I want to go to abroad it may cost me more than one
million Hong Kong <,> alone in in in a medical school in uh elsewhere so it  ' s
it  ' s really very expensive uh <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X338:1:Z>
And it  ' s beyond my <,> the means of my family so it  ' s
impossible uh yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#339:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#340:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#341:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#342:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X343:1:Z>
But when I came here I <,> I also have uh lot of of problems
because I couldn't really speak Cantonese <{1> <[1> at </[1> first uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X344:1:Z>
So when I first came here it  ' s like a lot of noise and uh <&>
speaker A laughed </&> I didn't know what was happening and <,,> and to make
matters worse I can't really read Chinese you see <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X345:1:Z>
So I </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#346:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#347:1:A>
<[2> Uh uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#348:1:A>
Because you love you look like Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X349:1:Z>
Yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X350:1:Z>
But but the problem is when I go to a restaurant it  ' s that I
don't know what to order and uh <,> I have to depend a lot on my friends for
the first <,> first two years uh <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X351:1:Z>
Then uh right now I am having less less problems with the less
problems with with uh ordering food uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X352:1:Z>
Usually I go to a restaurant and uh I roughly know what to order
but sometimes I may have to look at what other people are eating then I can
order <&> both laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X353:1:Z>
So uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#354:1:A>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#355:1:A>
You can trial and error

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X356:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X357:1:Z>
It  ' s quite funny sometimes when people realize that I can't read
Chinese and <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and at the same time I  ' m speaking Chinese so
they say uh <,> they are quite puzzled at at at this fact

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X358:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#359:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#360:1:A>
It  ' s <,> the same case as Jackie Chan

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#361:1:A>
Do you know <{1> <[1> who he is

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#362:1:A>
Yeah </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X363:1:Z>
<[1> Oh yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X364:1:Z>
yeah </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#365:1:A>
In fact uh he can't read or write uh English but he can speak
and listen English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X366:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#367:1:A>
Because uh he just uh loved to speak and uh listen <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> just for his communication with foreigners

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X368:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X369:1:Z>
Uh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X370:1:Z>
I I I just recently watched his movie <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X371:1:Z>
Uh the first <?> yeah </?> the one that <?> they shoot </?> in
the Chinese New Year </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#372:1:A>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#373:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X374:1:Z>
I think it was quite funny </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#375:1:A>
Because uhm he invest much money and effort <{1> <[1> on
</[1> his film

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X376:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X377:1:Z>
Do you watch this <{1> <[1> his </[1> film </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#378:1:A>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#379:1:A>
Uhm I don't know why but uh I don't like him much because I think
he  ' s too proud of himself

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X380:1:Z>
Yeah but uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#381:1:A>
Maybe because he he is very confident <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
yeah but uhm <,> uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#382:1:A>
Another factor is that I I don't like action film

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X383:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X384:1:Z>
Uh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X385:1:Z>
So what sort of film do you <,,> really like </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#386:1:A>
Uhm <,> what sort

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#387:1:A>
It all depends uh for example uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#388:1:A>
If I <,> I saw uhm the poster or the <.> advert </.> advertisment
on TV <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> of a film and look attractive and I may I may go
and watch it <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> if I have time

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#389:1:A>
And another reason <,> uh of choosing a film <,,> maybe uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#390:1:A>
As for Sense and Sensibility <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> I  ' ve taken a
course uhm Novel One when I was in second year <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#391:1:A>
Uhm Sense and Sensibility is one of the novel uhm in study so uhm
when this film <,> is now on show <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> and I have interest to
to have a look on it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#392:1:A>
It  ' s difficult to tell <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#393:1:A>
Maybe uh it also depends on uh other other people  ' s comment on
the film

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X394:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X395:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X396:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X397:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X398:1:Z>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X399:1:Z>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X400:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X401:1:Z>
Did <.> hav </.> have you watch the show called Pulp Fiction </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#402:1:A>
I watched it at home

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X403:1:Z>
Do do you like it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#404:1:A>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X405:1:Z>
Or you

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X406:1:Z>
Uh why do you

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X407:1:Z>
Why don't you like it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#408:1:A>
Because uhm <,,> I don't like uhm <,> the atmosphere to be
too dim <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#409:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#410:1:A>
I think uhm the atmosphere in Pulp Fiction is in is very dim and
<,> and <,> not cheerful <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#411:1:A>
And

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X412:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X413:1:Z>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X414:1:Z>
Do you find it too violent or <{1> <[1> <,> too </[1> vulgar </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#415:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#416:1:A>
I don't like violence and <,,> it involved too much violence in
the film <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so I feel uncomfortable <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and
in the middle of of the film <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> I asked my friend to stop it
<&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#417:1:A>
And then asked him to to watch it again when I left

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X418:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X419:1:Z>
<[2> Uh uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X420:1:Z>
<[3> Uh uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X421:1:Z>
Oh

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X422:1:Z>
How about how about uh Forrest Gump <{1> <[1> <unc> several
words </unc> </[1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#423:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X424:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#425:1:A>
Uhm I I don't uhm exactly remember uhm <,> the story <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#426:1:A>
But uhm <,,> I think uh Tom Hanks is a good actor

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X427:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X428:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X429:1:Z>
The movie is uh very I think a very <.> meanin </.> meaningful
movie <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X430:1:Z>
It captures a lot of uh <,> important events that happened in
America <unc> two-words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X431:1:Z>
Uh <,> it  ' s yeah I think it  ' s it  ' s quite a good movie yeah
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#432:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#433:1:A>
And there is also a sense of humor in the film

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X434:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#435:1:A>
I like it uhm I like uh things to be cheerful and <,> and
funny

Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#437:1:A>

Seven yeah <,> yeah </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#441:1:A>
I think it  ' s good <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but uhm <,> from the
start to the end I don't like the the atmostphere <{2> <[2> because </[2>
there  ' s almost no light

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X442:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X443:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X444:1:Z>
Yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X445:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X446:1:Z>
Do you find them uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#447:1:A>
Too violent also <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#448:1:A>
Yeah but uh I will feel uncomfortable and maybe sometimes I intend
to leave early <{1> <[1> <&> A laughed </&> </[1> but I never do so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X449:1:Z>
<[1> Oh I see </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X455:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#465:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#466:1:A>

fewer drama because I have no <.> s </.> not so much time and and I think the
title uhm <,> is not attractive to me so I <,> I just give them up

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X467:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X468:1:Z>

<[4> <,> </[4> and the second one I expect uhm it should be very uhm <,> high
standard <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> but uh it turned out it doesn't doesn't match my
my expectation <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X528:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X530:1:Z>
To queue </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#531:1:A>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#532:1:A>
Are not confident enough to speak in English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X533:1:Z>
Uhm but for me I think <,> the

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X534:1:Z>
Basically their English I mean <,> since uh you  ' ve been studying
English since in your primary and secondary school <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> as
well as in your university I think I think the vocabulary and the grammar is
there but just like what you say there  ' s not much uh <,> opportunity to
speak it so uh I think if you if you are given opportunity and uh you try it
won't be a problem for it won't be a problem for many of the Hong Kong people
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X535:1:Z>
Uh a a lot of my friends like <,> the medical students uh <,>
their English tend to improve much more after the third year <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> third year fourth year fifth year because uh what we usually do is we
we  ' ll ask the patient  ' s history in Cantonese <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> but when
we have to present the case to the doctor we have to converse in English uh
<{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X536:1:Z>
So <,> right now it  ' s like uh English is quite important uh so a
lot of us has to speak English uh everyday uh so in that way it forces you to
speak English and so

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X537:1:Z>
I think many of my friends  '  English has improved uh over these
uh I think over especially after the third year

<ICE-HK:S1A-008#X538:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-008#539:1:A>
