THE Hong Kong Amateur Swimming Association is looking to add
15-year-old Billy Kwok to the national squad for October  ' s Asian Games in
Hiroshima , Japan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#4:1>
Ronnie Wong Man-chiu , chairman of the HKASA , said yesterday the
association wanted to find some young swimmers to fill the void in the
national team once renowned internationals Michael Wright and Arthur Li
retire . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#5:1>
&ldquo; The Asian Games is definitely the last international
tournament for Michael .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#6:1>
And Arthur is 21 now , so you can't expect him to swim for many more
years .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#7:1>
We have to prepare for their retirement , &rdquo; said Wong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#8:1>
Wong hopes that Kwok can play a key role in the territory  ' s relay
teams . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#9:1>
Although the HKASA need the approval of the Hong Kong Amateur
Sports Federation and Olympic Committee , Wong said they were originally
asked to make up an 11-swimmer squad .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#10:1>
So , there is still one more place for Kwok to fill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#11:1>
The current Asian Games squad has seven women and three men :
Michael Wright , Arthur Li , Mark Kwok Kin-ming , Robyn Lamsam , Katie Lau
King-ting , Fenella Ng Garlok , Caroline Ng , Snowie Pang Wan-yiu , Heidi
Wong Hoi-tik and Vivian Lee Ying-shih . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#12:1>
Kwok , a Form Four science student at St Joseph College ,
represented the territory in the World Cup Short Course Championships in
January .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#13:1>
He swam in the 50 metres , 100 metres and 200 metres backstroke
events as well as 400 metres individual medley . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#14:1>
Kwok said he was disappointed when not selected for next month  ' s
Commonwealth Games in Victoria , Canada .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#15:1>
He was suffering from respiratory problems in April and had a back
injury that required physiotherapy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#16:1>
But he said he has full recovered and has returned to normal
training . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#17:1>
&ldquo; I am sure I can be in top form in the Asian Games , if I
am selected .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#18:1>
I am getting in gear now , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#19:1>
Kwok is the short course national record holder for the 50 metres
backstroke &obrack; 28.19 seconds &cbrack; and 400 metres individual medley
&obrack; four minutes , 41 seconds &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#20:1>
Meanwhile , another new boy in the Asian Games squad &dash; Mark
Kwok &dash; swam at the three-day Hong Kong National Championships at
Aberdeen yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#21:1>
He clocked 16 minutes 48.36 seconds in the men  ' s 1,500 metres
freestyle &dash; much slower than his best time of 16 minutes 25.9 seconds
recorded in Las Vegas in May . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#22:1>
He said the heat of the Pao Yue Kong Swimming Pool had affected
his performance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#23:1>
&ldquo; I have only been back here for less than two weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#24:1>
I need some time to get used to the weather here .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#25:1>
I believe the pool in Hiroshima is much better , &rdquo; said the
16-year-old . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#26:1>
Mark will participate in the 200 metres and 1,500 metres
freestyle and the 400 metres individual medley . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#29:2>
GERMAN coach Karl Heinz Weigang has been given the pivotal role
in helping lift Vietnam  ' s international standard made brittle by 18 years of
war and political unrest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#30:2>
Weigang , who has been hired as a technical adviser to the
Vietnamese Football Association , graduated from the same coaching course as
German coach Berti Vogts in 1968 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#31:2>
With Vietnam  ' s economy booming , the once war-ravaged country
want to return to the international fold in a big way by appointing
FIFA-sponsored Weigang who takes charge of two Vietnamese national teams
&dash; north and south &dash; or District A and District B . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#32:2>
A VFA official said Weigang would have to fly between Ho Chi Minh
in the south and Hanoi in the north frequently during the first phase of his
appointment which ends in September 10 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#33:2>
A Vietnamese official said Vietnam would not compete in October  ' s
Asian Games in Hiroshima , Japan and would instead concentrate on the 18th
Asian Cup in December , 1995 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#34:2>
Vietnam made their international return in the World Cup
qualifying rounds last year where they were grouped with North Korea , Qatar
, Indonesia and Singapore . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#35:2>
Vietnam finished bottom of the group but the VFA association
blamed their long absence from the game for their poor showing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#36:2>
Weigang , who holds a degree in engineering , gave up his chosen
profession after graduating from the coaching course 26 years ago . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#37:2>
He had a short spell with FIFA in Zurich , Switzerland and spent
some time coaching and teaching in Southeast Asia and Africa . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#38:2>
The 58-year-old German has spent 14 years in Asia travelling from
Hanoi to Cambodia and Laos and lived 17 years in Africa . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#39:2>
He coached the national teams of Mali , Ghana and Cameroon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#40:2>
But his main claim to fame was coaching the Cameroon national
youth team which then included Oman Biyick , Kana Biyick , Stephen Tataw and
David Embe &dash; established stars of the Indomitable Lions  '  World Cup
squad . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#41:2>
His biggest challenge is about to begin with the Vietnamese
national team . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#42:2>
&ldquo; My first job is to observe , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#43:2>
&ldquo; This is the first time I have dealt with the Vietnamese
players , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#44:2>
Weigang said he would exchange ideas with Vietnam  ' s head coach
Tran Duy Long and would submit a report to the VFA upon completing the first
phase of his contract . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#45:2>
There are 49 players in the two Vietnamese national teams .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#46:2>
The VFA will pick the best 30 at the beginning of next year for the
Asian Cup . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#47:2>
The Vietnamese national league is divided into three regions
&dash; 18 teams in both northern and central regions and 16 in the southern
region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#48:2>
The top two teams in each region compete in the two-leg ,
knock-out round together with the team of the host city and the champions of
the previous season . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#49:2>
The host this season is Quang Nan Danang Club and last season  ' s
champions were Cang Saigon , the same team who beat Hong <-> Hong </-> <+>
Kong </+> First Division new boys Golden 2-0 last Sunday . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#52:3>
HONG KONG newcomers Golden again fell foul of local referees
during their tour of Vietnam yesterday when they were beaten 2-1 by the
country  ' s national team . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#53:3>
International midfielder Chiu Chung-man , playing on loan from
South China this season , received his marching orders after taking a kick at
an opposition defender at a stage when his team were a goal ahead . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#54:3>
Chiu had been the subject of some controversial tackles by the
Vietnamese but he was considered the offender when the referee gave him a
yellow card for complaining too loudly about a bad tackle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#55:3>
And four minutes from half-time the intimidation proved too much
for Chiu , who retaliated and was immediately marched . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#56:3>
The decision incensed his teammates and there was a minor scuffle
between them and their Vietnamese counterparts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#57:3>
The local fans did not react too kindly to the incident and
pelted Chiu with plastic bottles as he left the pitch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#58:3>
Despite the defeat , Golden chairman Simon Wan Chi-lok said he
considered his team had gained a moral victory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#59:3>
&ldquo; Our players produced a very good performance , &rdquo;
said Wan .

<ICE-HK:W2C-017#60:3>
&ldquo; Shame on the referees . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#61:3>
The game had started well enough for Golden with a goal coming in
the 14th minute . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#62:3>
Former Rangers right-back Tang Chi-ming sent the ball into the
penalty area and a Vietnamese defender failed to clear , leaving Scottish
striker Lee Bullen with a simple finish . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-017#63:3>
Golden return to Hong Kong this evening with right back Tang ,
left-back Yau Wo-kan and sweeper Mike Duxbury carrying injuries and stopper
Glenn Humphries suffering from illness . </p>

<p>
