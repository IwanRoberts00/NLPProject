<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-033#1:1:A>
And I am sorry we have to start I mean I have to start speaking
so early because as you know there is a Legco meeting today which starts at
two thirty

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#2:1:A>
But before that there is another meeting which starts at two fifteen
and I would like to take uh questions after I speak so that  ' s why I mean I
hope with your indulgence you can <unc> three words </unc> your
dessert while you are listening to me

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#3:1:A>
And uhm <.> wha </.> what I  ' ll try to do in the next uh few fifteen
minutes or so is to uh try to answer some of the questions that I  ' ve been
asked early <?> on </?> over lunch

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#4:1:A>
Uh my experience as the uh only woman elected uh member of the Legco
and also as an independent

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#5:1:A>
How I see things working out now in the uh new star Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#6:1:A>
And then uh to give you uh just to leave you with a few of the
problems that I see uh which are very important problems and which of course
I will go into in depth and it will more depth tomorrow in the Legislative
Council Debate which I I

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#7:1:A>
Because I  ' m scheduled to speak tomorrow and I don't want to give
everything away today otherwise nobody will listen to me when I stand up to
speak tomorrow

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#8:1:A>
First of all yes I  ' ve been in journalism for fifteen years

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#9:1:A>
And in April this year I gave it all up to stand for election

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#10:1:A>
And a number of people have said to me that <unc> three-words
</unc> you be very brave very courageous

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#11:1:A>
And I think the reason they said that was and they said it in April
not and even and some are still saying it now but it <unc> one-word
</unc> more <?> in </?> back in April and May

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#12:1:A>
The reason I think they said that was many of them and I think
including many people in government very senior positions in government

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#13:1:A>
They all thought I was going to lose

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#14:1:A>
And they thought she  ' s so stupid

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#15:1:A>
She gave up her job at the review she gave up the chairmanship of
the Hong Kong Journalist Association

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#16:1:A>
Gave up everything to stand for election knowing full well she
would lose

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#17:1:A>
And actually and of course <.> i </.> during the whole campaign I
have about a thousand people and the vast majority of them I did not know

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#18:1:A>
They came forward to offering their support to me

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#19:1:A>
And some of them told me they said we  ' ve been told by our uh by
other <.> mem </.> uh people in the constituency not to support me

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#20:1:A>
And they have very good reason

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#21:1:A>
They said don't support Emily Lau because she would definitely lose

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#22:1:A>
And <?> then </?> by supporting the loser you were <?> attacking
</?> us the winners

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#23:1:A>
<?> Actually </?> she  ' s definitely not going to be one of the two
winners so you are very stupid and you are putting your institution your
organization into a very tricky position after September fifteen because you
would have bet the wrong horse

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#24:1:A>
But anyway some of my supporters did not listen to that and in the
end they were very happy

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#25:1:A>
So I think the reason why I say well why I decided to stand was <,>
most important reason was I thought I could win

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#26:1:A>
In fact I was very certain that I would win

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#27:1:A>
So why did I think I could win <?> was that </?> first of all I
decided to give up everything <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#28:1:A>
And I think <.> any </.> and I think of all the fifty four
candidates who stood for direct election

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#29:1:A>
Nobody has done that

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#30:1:A>
Some of my colleagues has now given up their profession because
they own two or three seats in various councils

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#31:1:A>
But I am still the only person who is working full time as a as a
legislator

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#32:1:A>
And I think <.> th </.> the fact that I was prepared to give up my
entire career had a very strong appeal to the voters and that  ' s one thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#33:1:A>
And the second reason was I know that many Hong Kong people support
me

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#34:1:A>
And that  ' s why I decided to stand

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#35:1:A>
They support me because they know what I have said and done in the
past

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#36:1:A>
And they have communicated their support to me time and time again
in writing telephone calls faxes and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#37:1:A>
And so I know that generally in Hong Kong I  ' ve got quite a few of
some supporters

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#38:1:A>
And then of course another reason is that the although the other
opponents uh we have uh actually seven people standing six men but four of
them are actually incumbent councillors or someone who serve for many years

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#39:1:A>
So these are very strong very opponents but they <.> al </.>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#40:1:A>
Many of them or several of them held more than one seat and I was
only contesting for one seat

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#41:1:A>
And that again went down very well with the election

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#42:1:A>
So you can see the psychology of the Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#43:1:A>
They want someone who is prepared to make some sacrifice for public
office

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#44:1:A>
They do not want people who want to grab and grab and grab

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#45:1:A>
And suddenly when someone like that comes along that has a strong
appeal

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#46:1:A>
And then of course another factor was that I was very hard working

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#47:1:A>
But then of course many other contestants many <?> other </?>
candidates would tell you they also work very hard

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#48:1:A>
And indeed <?> driving </?> in Sha Tin or in New Territories East
if you ask the other candidates if you ask uh the voters they will all agree
that I work very hard

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#49:1:A>
And actually we all work very hard most of the candidates

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#50:1:A>
And that  ' s why the turn out rate in Sha Tin was fifty percent
where as the overall turn out rate for the whole colony is forty percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#51:1:A>
So I think when voters saw candidates and when they saw it was a
very keenly contested race they turn <?> up </?> to vote

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#52:1:A>
So with all those factors I stood and I won

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#53:1:A>
Of course I came out number one

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#54:1:A>
I even defeated Andrew Wong who  ' s <.> bein </.> who  ' s an
incumbent member for six years

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#55:1:A>
I  ' ve got almost seven thousand votes more than Andrew

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#56:1:A>
And I thank my constituents for their support

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#57:1:A>
And now we are in this new style Legco which has for the first time
eighteen directly elected members and twenty one from functional
constituencies seventeen appointed and three government officials senior
government officials

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#58:1:A>
And many of you will probably be wondering how is this new Legco
going to work

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#59:1:A>
And uh I think already our colleagues and government officials are
getting a taste of you know how things uh will change uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#60:1:A>
One thing that we have been discussing and we will discuss uh will
continue to <.> dis </.> discuss is the setting up of committee systems
whether

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#61:1:A>
Well I actually I was quite shocked last week to learn that you
know all these committees in uh Legco ad call them ad hoc groups call them
panels

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#62:1:A>
They have no uh statutory uh basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#63:1:A>
They have just set up and the one day they are here next day they
are gone

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#64:1:A>
Not even like the Urban Council or the Regional Council which is uh
included in the standing orders that ordered uh very clear stipulation for
the formation of these uh committees

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#65:1:A>
So I think now uh most of <.> th </.> my colleagues agreed that we
now need to get things <?> formularize </?> so that you know we will have
these committees set up formally

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#66:1:A>
And then of course that is not contentious

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#67:1:A>
But what is contentious is the power of these committees

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#68:1:A>
Uh some colleagues want to think that these committees should uh
concentrate on the scrutinizing <?> fields </?> put forward by the
administration and then leaving uh uh whole <?> list </?> of panels uh which
they have in the past

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#69:1:A>
The OMELCO panels that means panels including members of the
Executive and Legislative Councils dealing with policies

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#70:1:A>
But then of course the problem that immediately arises is how can
you know we only have fifty odd people

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#71:1:A>
How can we join the panel as well as <.> jo </.> joining these
committees when they are dealing with very similar things

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#72:1:A>
So that  ' s one thing <?> I </?> want to argue

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#73:1:A>
The other thing of course is even more <.> con </.> contentious is
the fact that we do not want ExCo members or some of us do not want ExCo
members and official executive council members to be a part of us because we
want the Legislative Council to be independent and to be seen to be
independent

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#74:1:A>
And that  ' s going to be very contentious so I will just sort of
giving you an <.> intro </.> introduction next time when you see a headline
in the paper you know what it  ' s all about

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#75:1:A>
We are arguing whether Executive Councillors of course as I said in
the meeting last week

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#76:1:A>
I said there is a problem that has been built into the structure is
that Executive Councillors are being appointed to the Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#77:1:A>
So they are in their own way Legco members as well and I find that
very unfortunate

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#78:1:A>
I don't think that should be the case

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#79:1:A>
But anyway they are here and we cannot exclude them

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#80:1:A>
<?> So </?> one member suggested that okay they are also Legco
members and these are Legco Committees but they should not be allowed to be
chairman or vice chairman of these committees so as to <?> give </?> the
public that these committees are chaired by Legco member alone and not Legco
ExCo members

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#81:1:A>
And this is very contentious

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#82:1:A>
And uh some members of course disagree very uh vehemently and they
think ExCo members <?> shouldn't </?> allow to be continued to to chair these
committees

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#83:1:A>
And this morning uh the reason I was late for this lunch was that
there was a meeting of the uhm Security Panel and today  ' s meeting was the
first meeting and we had to select the uh convener or the chairman

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#84:1:A>
And last term of course <?> Rita </?> Fang was the chairman and
today she was there and then somebody again raised this business of ExCo
member not should not be uh chairman or at least the chairman and deputy
chairman should not be both from ExCo and then in the end we had an election

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#85:1:A>
And of course uh we don't need to guess <unc> one-word
</unc> the result of <?> this </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#86:1:A>
Of course <?> Rita </?> won

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#87:1:A>
And with <?> there were </?> nineteen of us present she got uhm the
other person who was uhm whose name was put forward

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#88:1:A>
I I suggested Doctor C H Leung he turned it down

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#89:1:A>
I suggested Dr Conrad Lam he turned it down and Conrad suggested me
and I turned it down

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#90:1:A>
And then <?> someone </?> suggested Elsie

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#91:1:A>
<?> Elsie Elsie Ellie To </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#92:1:A>
She accepted it so there was an election <unc> three-words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#93:1:A>
Elsie got six votes and Rita got thirteen so Rita was elected
convener and Elsie deputy convener

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#94:1:A>
Because when the time takes to elect the deputy convener will also
have <unc> three-words </unc> and nobody else contested

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#95:1:A>
So uh but so I think this but of course I told as I said to them
this morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#96:1:A>
I said you know now we are reviewing the whole thing so whatever we
decide now should be very <?> temporary </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#97:1:A>
But uh I still think that ExCo member should play no part as
chairman or vice chairman but uhm I I have no illusions

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#98:1:A>
I <.> thou </.> I think I will lose

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#99:1:A>
But uh but anyway that  ' s the way I hope things will uh progress

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#100:1:A>
And then another thing that also happened this morning which I I
think you maybe interested to know is that the meeting this morning was
convene very hurriedly

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#101:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#102:1:A>
Because of the government  ' s announcement yesterday or the
actually the British and the Vietnamese government on the Vietnamese boat
people problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#103:1:A>
And then this they and then they wanted to brief us this morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#104:1:A>
And as I told <unc> two words </unc> this morning the
Secretary for Security

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#105:1:A>
I said since we are always the last to be briefed

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#106:1:A>
You were bringing the <?> press </?> or I don't know whatever <?>
goods </?> left right in the center yesterday

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#107:1:A>
And I thought so many phone calls from the press and I said to
them

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#108:1:A>
I said I don't know what <?> in the world </?> is going on

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#109:1:A>
How can I comment on something I don't know

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#110:1:A>
And they said ah they took <.> pi </.> pity on me and they sent me
a press release <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#111:1:A>
And they did it

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#112:1:A>
So <?> farcical </?> isn't it

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#113:1:A>
So and I said to Ellison

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#114:1:A>
I said enough is enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#115:1:A>
I think in the future when government makes big statements
announcements you should do what ministers do in the UK

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#116:1:A>
You make them in parliament

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#117:1:A>
You make them during the Legislative Council Meeting

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#118:1:A>
Open session in public

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#119:1:A>
And then we should be given time immediately after your statement
to stand up and ask questions

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#120:1:A>
Of course after that you can still go on and <?> release </?> the
press by all means

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#121:1:A>
But then let us be the first

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#122:1:A>
Not the first

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#123:1:A>
We will never be the first as I told Ellison

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#124:1:A>
I know we will never be the first

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#125:1:A>
But please don't let us be the last to know

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#126:1:A>
And I <?> am a little </?> of course the the question which
immediately arises is the fact that Legco meets one one afternoon a week and
sometimes the timing maybe a problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#127:1:A>
But I don't think that should <.> pro </.> uh provide an
insurmountable problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#128:1:A>
But anyway I would like to see next time when the government makes
a major announcement

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#129:1:A>
Do it in Legco and give us the chance immediately after the
statement is made to ask questions

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#130:1:A>
Then you can go on and release the press

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#131:1:A>
But of course we would have been we would have asked questions
already

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#132:1:A>
The press would have seen us asking questions then they don't need
to come to us

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#133:1:A>
Then you can the the government official can go on and <?> release
</?> them

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#134:1:A>
So that  ' s another thing that I would like to see happening

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#135:1:A>
And so I I guess what I am trying to tell you is we want to make
as I told my colleagues last week in this whole business of looking at the
restructuring of the uh system what I want to see the structure that will
emerge at the end of the day

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#136:1:A>
I think it  ' s something that is simple <,> and is very clearly
delineated that the public can understand and more importantly that me and my
colleagues can understand and can take part in

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#137:1:A>
And also the public can take part in in the sense they can come to
these sessions and all these committees panels whatever you call them make
representations

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#138:1:A>
All these should happen in public

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#139:1:A>
And then people who can come they can sit in

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#140:1:A>
They can <.> y </.> you know come in and listen to the whole
deliberations

<ICE-HK:S2A-033#141:1:A>
This is what I hope will happen </I>
