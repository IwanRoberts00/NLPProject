Hello and welcome to this special election day edition of Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X2:1:Z>
How would the scandals involving Gary Cheng and the Democratic
affect the turnout <,> and what kind of legislature are we going to get

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X3:1:Z>
With us to discuss this issue are former legislator Allen Lee now
reincarnated as a political commentator and Professor Lau Siu Kai of the
Chinese University

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X4:1:Z>
Welcome <,> uh Allen <,> uh let me uh begin of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X5:1:Z>
Do you feel that the elections this year somehow are are less uh
exciting than uh previous elections that it seems to be much quiet and the
Gary Cheng uh scandal I think <unc> two-words </unc> <?> suffer </?>
a bit

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X6:1:Z>
But otherwise uh this has been a very quiet election campaign </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#7:1:A>
Well it has been uh uh you know I join the ninety eight
election myself

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#8:1:A>
And uh it was much more uh active <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and activities
at that time are for <unc> one-word </unc> vote et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#9:1:A>
And I remember on the election day it was very very pouring rain and
people going to the polling <{2> <[2> station </[2> you know and and so far I
think there there  ' s less people uh turn out

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#10:1:A>
Uh I think there are two effect first of all I think uh uh in the
last two years the whole of the legislature performance has been somewhat
disappointing uh in a way uh because people see hey you know we we elected uh
you into office but you haven't done very much for us <{3> <[3> uh in the <?>
first place </?> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#11:1:A>
Secondly <{4> <[4> recently is </[4> an of of Gary Cheng  ' s <{5>
<[5> uh </[5> uh scandal and I think really hurt some people really want to
go to the polling <{6> <[6> station </[6> and in fact I was talking to to
some people this morning

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#12:1:A>
And they say they don't know who do who they  ' re going to vote for
uh <{7> <[7> so they </[7> are not going to vote

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X13:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X14:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X15:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X16:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X17:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X18:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X19:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X20:1:Z>
Oh let  ' s <?> bring </?> Professor uh S K uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X21:1:Z>
Uh S K how do you think the uh these various scandals uh involving
uh Cheng Kai Nam and supposedly the Democrat

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X22:1:Z>
How would they affect the uh <,> uh election result

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X23:1:Z>
Who  ' s go to benefit who  ' s go to loss </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#24:1:B>
Well basically I think of course uh the DAB is going to loss
substantially because of these scandals

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#25:1:B>
The Democrats surprisingly may only benefit marginally <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#26:1:B>
I would say that the all the rest of the candidates and parties are
likely to also benefit to a certain extend from this scandal <{2> <[2> but on
</[2> the whole I would say that all are politicians are losers because of
this scandals <{3> <[3> because </[3> people had become more cynical <,> <{4>
<[4> of our </[4> politicians

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#27:1:B>
And that cynicism might be will be uh one of the factors ringing
down the voting turn out

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X28:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X29:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X30:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X31:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X32:1:Z>
That that good point

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X33:1:Z>
Uh now Allen before the Gary Cheng  ' s scandal emerge uh it was
widely expected that the DAB uh will become the largest party in legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X34:1:Z>
It now appears to that it  ' s not going to be a case </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#35:1:A>
Yeah well there was a <,> an <?> engage </?> themselves <?>
feel </?> <{1> <[1> of DAB <?> fellows </?> that </[1> they gone to be the
biggest party

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#36:1:A>
They want to <,> go <{2> <[2> through uh </[2> you know not only
that the election committee plus uh uh <{3> <[3> the functional </[3>
constituency state uh they go to get uh <,> uh quite a number of vote and
there was more than <,> than last time

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#37:1:A>
Well they may get <,> one or two vote than last time but they are
they are certainly very difficult to be <{4> <[4> <,> the </[4> largest party
in in in Legco

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#38:1:A>
<{5> <[5> Secondly </[5> I think the Gary Cheng uh affair uh <,>
really hurt DAB not only as a pub from public image stand point of view

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#39:1:A>
Because Gary has been <,> uh posing <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> as not only
the honest man as the front <{7> <[7> man uh </[7> for DAB

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#40:1:A>
Uh you know he looks very presentable and then he lie he lie again
and really uh uh hurt hurt the <unc> one-word </unc> <{8> <[8> <,>
</[8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#41:1:A>
And I think uh it  ' s very difficult now even if Gary Cheng is <{9>
<[9> elected </[9> for him to be a member of <{10> <[10> legislature </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#42:1:A>
So what happen in the next four years how could he stood up <,> uh
stand up uh in Legco and making a honest speech and people would believe him

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#43:1:A>
<{11> <[11> So so </[11> I think it would it  ' s <{12> <[12> a
</[12> difficult time for DAB <{13> <[13> <,> and </[13> certainly it would
be very difficult for them to be the largest party in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X44:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X45:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X46:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X47:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X48:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X49:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X50:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X51:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X52:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X53:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X54:1:Z>
<[11> Uhm uh </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X55:1:Z>
<[12> Uhm </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X56:1:Z>
<[13> Uhm uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X57:1:Z>
But S K do you see this as a temporary set back for the DAB </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#58:1:B>
Well look at this certainly

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#59:1:B>
I think it <,> it is a long term set back <{1> <[1> because </[1>
uh the DAB <,,> will not be able to withdraw <,> middle class votes in a
years ahead <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and most importantly <?> driven </?> the lack
of political stars of the DAB a party which is suffer from poor image may
have difficulty finding new talent <{3> <[3> to join </[3> the party and to
replace the those leaders who are going to retire in the in the years ahead

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#60:1:B>
So basically I think this <,> this scandal is <,> has a long term
impact on the DAB <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> uh which make it difficult for it to
broaden its social support face

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#61:1:B>
They go beyond the traditional leftists and the pro pro-Beijing
figures and the I I I think this is <,> the whole scandal is very sad <{5>
<[5> <,> </[5> for for the development of DAB

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X62:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X63:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X64:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X65:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X66:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X67:1:Z>
And what about the Democratic Party  ' s scandals uh uh uh are they
going to hurt the Democratic Party </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#68:1:A>
Well I think you know there are couple of things in the
Democratic Party not only with with the recent uh so sad how they <.> si </.>
how they use their funds

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#69:1:A>
Uh uh how they establish their <{1> <[1> company to </[1> do so

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#70:1:A>
Uh a lot of parties outside of Hong Kong you know that democratic
countries does that <{2> <[2> I mean </[2> <?> were </?> where had their
funds coming from you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#71:1:A>
Uh an evidence I think uh uh <,> the Democratic Party face internal
problem of <?> cohesionless </?> and of the the own people uh questioning uh
uh the <{3> <[3> leaders </[3> whether the Democratic Part is also become a
small circle <{4> <[4> of people </[4> who  ' s running it

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#72:1:A>
So I think they are facing <unc> one-word </unc> I think
all parties <{5> <[5> in Hong </[5> Kong now are facing different type of
problems

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#73:1:A>
So if you ask anybody today which party even if we have <,> party
politics <{6> <[6> in </[6> election for the Chief Executive <{7> <[7> for
<?> you </?> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#74:1:A>
Which party leader would would be trusted <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> and
that would be uh you know a very <unc> one-word </unc> question for
the community to ask

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#75:1:A>
Uh uh it  ' s not the maturity <,> uh of of politics

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#76:1:A>
I think we <,> we are having a a a movement towards fully
democratic e elected legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#77:1:A>
But I think people uh in Hong Kong want to see the <unc>
one-word </unc> of <{9> <[9> any political </[9> party stands uh stands
up <{10> <[10> and </[10> I think so far <{11> <[11> uh </[11> Democratic
Party you know has not been really fill that role either

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#78:1:A>
<{12> <[12> So </[12> it  ' s been uh disappointing uh <{13> <[13> uh
</[13> for the people in Hong Kong and I I  ' m not <,> I  ' m not surprise that
that uh there are less people turn out to vote

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#79:1:A>
Uh in fact uh I think if if uh Hong Kong development in the future
is towards uh uh maturity type of legislature and the performance of
<unc> one-word </unc> the legislature <{14> <[14> uh </[14> is very
<?> import </?> <{15> <[15> for </[15> our future development

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X80:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X81:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X82:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X83:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X84:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X88:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X89:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X90:1:Z>
<[11> Uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X91:1:Z>
<[12> Uhm </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X92:1:Z>
<[13> Uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X93:1:Z>
<[14> Uhm </[14> </{14>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X94:1:Z>
<[15> Uhm </[15> </{15>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X95:1:Z>
Now S K Allen mention that uh we  ' re moving towards a fully uh
elected directly elected legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X96:1:Z>
And of course one of the things <,> happening this year is that
the number of directly elected seats has gone from twenty to twenty four and
seat elected by election committee have dropped from ten to six

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X97:1:Z>
How would this change uh affect uh the various political parties
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#98:1:B>
Well I would say that uh uh <,> basically I think the
Democrats may benefit <,> by the increase of a number of seat whereas the
pro-government forces may find the seat <?> static </?> <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
but basically I think because of the increase uh number of direct elected
seats <{2> <[2> it is </[2> always possible for the new legislature <,> to be
able to produce some ac hoc or occasional majority against government <{3>
<[3> particularly </[3> <,> on social economic and livelihood issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#99:1:B>
That means <,> but if you count the twenty four directly elected
<,> uh members who are basically from the grassroots and then we will be add
a a few functional constituency members then easily there may be as as small
majority <,> uh or small coalition <,> in favour of <,> uh some <unc>
one-word </unc> policies some social welfare some labour policy the
things like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#100:1:B>
<{4> <[4> I would </[4> say that government we would under
tremendous pressure uh or uh in the new <,> uh <.> legis </.> legislature
even though on political issue such as political reform such as attitude
toward Beijing <,> or there might still be a small majority <,> against <{5>
<[5> uh </[5> the Democrats

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#101:1:B>
But so we are we are going to see which the <unc> one- word
</unc> situation where <,> the government will under tremendous pressure
on <,> uh those <?> mandate </?> issues social economic and livelihood <{6>
<[6> but still </[6> pretty safe on political issue

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X102:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X103:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X104:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X105:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X106:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X107:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X108:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#109:1:A>
Yeah while while I agree with S K uh on this point and I
think <,> uh it would be very <.> diff </.> for difficult for government now
uh after this selection

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#110:1:A>
Exceedingly difficult in two thousand and four <{1> <[1> I mean
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#111:1:A>
Uh the difficulty is this I take on uh uh a lot of social <,> uh
uh also you know commute <.> ty </.> type of issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#112:1:A>
Uh it  ' s very difficult for the whole legislature of against
something that the people of Hong Kong would like to see <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#113:1:A>
So it  ' s very difficult of for the government to govern uh from
now on

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#114:1:A>
Secondly I see the relationship <{3> <[3> uh between </[3> the
Executive uh and the uh legislature had not been uh established uh in the
last <,> uh <{4> <[4> legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#115:1:A>
Now </[4> in the new <,> elected legislature even be e e the
government what even face more difficult time

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#116:1:A>
So let me predict C H Tung had to change <,> had to change to
communicate with them <{5> <[5> more </[5> directly more effectively

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#117:1:A>
The Executive Council members got to be more effective <{6> <[6>
got to </[6> establish this channel communications

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#118:1:A>
If they don't I think they <?> gone </?> to running into trouble
and and it would be a set back for Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X119:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X120:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X121:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X122:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X123:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X124:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X125:1:Z>
Do do you see any sign that C H Tung is changing <{> <[> <?> as
understand this </?> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#126:1:A>
<[> Well not yet frankly </[> </{> not yet okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#127:1:A>
But he has to think and his his advisors <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#128:1:A>
I think they should and must advise him <,> that to to really
establish strong communication with the legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#129:1:A>
But don't forget they are not only making laws okay and they they
are <,> voting on all the budgets all the funding <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and uh
if you if you look at it the legislature seems very easily now to turn
government down on the funding <{3> <[3> requests </[3> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#130:1:A>
And if if they continue <,> with this uh uh uh you know with the
Chief Executive only go to <{4> <[4> legislature three </[4> times a year
alright and with the officials happened to be lobbying and they don't have to
be responsible for their policies and we will continue to see political turn
what <,> until

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X131:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X132:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X133:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X134:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X135:1:Z>
Okay we will continue uh discussing this after the break

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X136:1:Z>
Don't go away we  ' ll be right back <&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X137:1:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re discussing the Legislative Council elections

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X138:1:Z>
S K one of the problem that Hong Kong has had is a pretty bad
relationship between the legislature and the executive and part of that is I
guess because of Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X139:1:Z>
But are are they <?> also </?> uh personal factors involved that
is like the uh Chief Executive uh that that  ' s he make a difference </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#140:1:B>
Oh I think the personal factor is very important

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#141:1:B>
Uh I think the Basic Law <,> does not <unc> one-word
</unc> C H Tung from <,> trying to cooperate with the legislature but
instead he insists on a narrow definition of an executive lead <{1> <[1>
government </[1> and and take an exclusionary approach <,> towards the
legislature which does not allow the legislature to participate in meaningful
decision making

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#142:1:B>
So that kind approach if want to break an oppositionist or or <?>
structurist </?> <{2> <[2> legislature </[2> and that personal factor in the
way of C H Tung approach toward the legislature particularly toward the <,>
uh popularly elected legislators

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#143:1:B>
It brings a lot <,> to poor relationship between the executive and
the legislature in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X144:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X145:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X146:1:Z>
Can uhm can anything be done about this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#147:1:A>
Well I think he has to do something

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#148:1:A>
I mean it  ' s not much time left for his this term now

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#149:1:A>
Uh and I think not only the uh the Executive Council and the
legislature had very poor or none at all of communications

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#150:1:A>
Uh you could see the Exco members uh a lot of all are very afraid
of to speak out on policy in public

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#151:1:A>
And some some of the Exco members <unc> one-word </unc> or
you know we haven't heard them to say a thing in three years

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#152:1:A>
That  ' s to me that  ' s not Legco uh that  ' s not Exco <{1> <[1> okay
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#153:1:A>
They are policy they decide on policy collectively and
collectively should be responsible for their decision instead <{2> <[2> it is
the </[2> officials to goes to uh <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> the Legco <{4> <[4> uh
</[4> all the time not being for <?> boat </?> <{5> <[5> playing </[5> the
political <{6> <[6> road </[6> yet has no political responsibility

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#154:1:A>
So I think that the the problem if if C H Tung does not see that
is a problem <,> then I I think there is <{7> <[7> no cure okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#155:1:A>
He </[7> has to realize it is a <{8> <[8> problem </[8> <,> uh
because the the executive branch and the legislature <{9> <[9> had </[9> to
work hand in hand <{10> <[10> mainly </[10> because at the present moment he
cannot assure himself <{11> <[11> of how </[11> many votes he  ' s got in <{12>
<[12> uh in </[12> the legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#156:1:A>
You could say all sixty members of the legislature are belong to
the opposition <{13> <[13> <,> </[13> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#157:1:A>
He  ' s got to get the vote

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X158:1:Z>

<[11> Uhm </[11> </{11>

<[12> Uhm </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X170:1:Z>
<[13> Yes </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X171:1:Z>
Now S K <,> uh the new election that will come the new
legislature that will come into office next month

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X172:1:Z>
Uh do you think that it should take up the issue that have
preoccupied much of Hong Kong recently like the the hearings on uh Robert
Chung uh should should they uh hold hearings and also should they uh look
into the Gary Cheng affair </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#173:1:B>
Well I think on on Gary Cheng affair I I agree that the the
legislators should look into the affair very closely but in the case of of
the Robert Chung affair <,> I have some reservation because <,> I would say
that the Hong Kong people have already had their mind set on on that issue is
to who is right and who is wrong

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#174:1:B>
The other thing is that uh I don't very much whether the
legislature can really find the truth on this matter when there are so much
subjective element involved <{1> <[1> in the </[1> in that story

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#175:1:B>
Most importantly from Hong Kong  ' s <,> uh stability point of view
<,> <{2> <[2> the further </[2> investigation may mean uh even more <,> uh
hostile executive <{3> <[3> legislative </[3> relationship and I  ' m afraid
that there this so called anti-Tung pro- Tung <,> confrontation <{4> <[4>
will </[4> become even more serious that may <{5> <[5> destabilize </[5> Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#176:1:B>
That  ' s that  ' s why <,> what I  ' m trying to say is that the less
the <?> Legco </?> of course has the right and has the reason to further
investigate <{6> <[6> but I </[6> simply <?> and </?> worry about all the
<unc> one-word </unc> consequences <{7> <[7> for Hong Kong </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X177:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X178:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X179:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X180:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X181:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X182:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X183:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm uhm </[7> </{7> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#184:1:A>
Well S K though though you have concern uh similar <?> amend
</?> to a lot of people  ' s concern but I I I <unc> one-word </unc>
the new legislature <,> was that were was work to set up a select committee
to look into the uh Robert Chung affair uh for the various reason actually
the university senate <{1> <[1> didn't </[1> come into any type of conclusion
accepting or rejecting the <{2> <[2> report </[2> either it has laid the
responsibility though the two Vice-Chancellors resign <{3> <[3> uh </[3> of
of what why this incident came

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#185:1:A>
Uh whether uh Andrew Lo visited <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> uh to the
Vice-Chancellor has anything to do uh with with this whole affair

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#186:1:A>
And besides and uh uh the report does say that uh Andrew Lo was a
uh was a very poor and <?> trueful </?> <{5> <[5> witness </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#187:1:A>
So when it says this kind <unc> one-word </unc> the truth
must come out

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#188:1:A>
So when <{6> <[6> when </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X189:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X190:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X191:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X192:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X193:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#X194:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6> so you think uh the new Legco uh should hold
<{> <[> hearings </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-039#195:1:A>
<[> While </[> </{> I think now the I think a lot a lot of
new Legco a lot of Legco <{1> <[1> members </[1> are thinking of it now uh
even <{2> <[2> during </[2> their campaign they <{3> <[3> say </[3> they want
to set up a select <{4> <[4> committee </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#196:1:A>
So it it would be very <?> important </?> but nevertheless it  ' s a
fact of life that there will be <unc> one-word </unc> <{5> <[5> now
</[5> as far as uh Gary  ' s concern Gary Cheung is concern

<ICE-HK:S1B-039#197:1:A>
And I think he you know he he has suffer a great deal and it and
uh personally I don't think he should be uh uh a Legco member because from
now on even if he  ' s selected because of the <{6> <[6> system </[6> <,> uh he
would loss totally his effectiveness <{7> <[7> as </[7> a member of the
legislature
