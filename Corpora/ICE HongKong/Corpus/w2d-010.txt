<bold> Giving Notice </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#3:1>
When two people wish to marry , it is essential that a written
Notice of Marriage on the prescribed form is given in advance at a Marriage
Registry in Hong Kong, whether the marriage is to take place at a Marriage
Registry or in a licensed place of public worship .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#4:1>
There are no residential requirements and the two people may be of any
nationality .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#5:1>
However , a party to a marriage must not be under 16 years of age
&obrack; European reckoning &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#6:1>
The notice , except for an overseas notice &obrack; mentioned
later &cbrack; , is given by one or both of the parties to the proposed
marriage at the Marriage Registry with their Hong Kong identity cards or
travel documents or some other identifying documents .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#7:1>
At the time the notice is given , the following personal particulars
of the parties must be provided : full names &semi; whether bachelor or
widower, spinster or widow &semi; whether a divorced person or previously
married by any form of marriage &semi; rank or profession &semi; age &semi;
dwelling places &semi; the full name of parents of each of the parties and ,
in the case of a party under the age of 21 , the name and address of the
person consenting to the marriage , and also the capacity of this person-
that is , the relevant person or persons specified in the Third Schedule to
the Marriage Ordinance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#8:1>
The notice will be exhibited at the Marriage Registry where it is
given and also at the Marriage Registration &ampersand; Records Office for at
least 15 clear days .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#9:1>
During this period any person who is authorised by law to object to
the proposed marriage may do so by writing the word &lsquo; <mention>
Forbidden </mention> &rsquo; on the copy of the notice produced by the
Registrar for inspection , and by signing his name and the character in which
he objects to the proposed marriage .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#10:1>
If the Registrar of Marriages considers that the person is not in
fact authorised by law to object, he may allow the marriage to proceed .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#11:1>
If , however , he considers that the objection is valid , either of
the parties may appeal against his decision by petition to the Court of First
Instance to determine the matter .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#12:1>
The decision of the Court of First Instance is final . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#13:1>
If no objection is received after the period of 15 clear days ,
the marriage may take place .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#14:1>
The exact date and time for the celebration of the proposed marriage
should be fixed in advance in consultation with the Registrar in charge of
the Marriage Registry where the marriage is to take place or with the
officiating minister if the marriage is to take place in a licensed place of
public worship . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#15:1>
After a Notice of Marriage is given , the marriage must take
place within a period of three months , otherwise the notice becomes void and
fresh notice must be given before the marriage can take place .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#16:1>
Appointments for marriage ceremonies are given on a
first-come-first-served basis .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#17:1>
Reservations by telephone are not entertained to ensure that every
member of the public will have a fair chance to choose a desired day for
marriage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#18:1>
While the normal period of notice is 15 clear days , the
Registrar may shorten this period in special circumstances .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#19:1>
Each case will be considered on its individual merits .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#20:1>
A special fee will be charged for such cases . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#21:1>
<bold> Minors , Divorcees and Widower/Widow </bold> </h> If either
party is under the age of 21 but above the age of 16 &obrack; European
reckoning &cbrack; and not a widower or a widow , the consent in writing of
the relevant person or persons specified in the Third Schedule to the
Marriage Ordinance must be produced .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#22:1>
Forms for giving such consent are available at any of the Marriage
Registries .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#23:1>
If there is no such person capable of consenting , the party may
apply to a District Judge for such consent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#24:1>
In the case of a divorced person , proof of the dissolution of
the former marriage by decree pronounced by a competent court is required
&semi; and before the marriage takes place , a sealed , certified copy of the
court  ' s final decree must be produced to the Registrar .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#25:1>
The question of whether or not a particular decree is recognised in
Hong Kong is too complicated to be summarised here and reference should be
made to the detailed provisions of Part IX of the Matrimonial Causes
Ordinance , Cap. 179 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#26:1>
In the case of a widower or a widow , proof of former marriage
and death certificate of former spouse are required . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#27:1>
If the divorce documents or death certificates are not written in
English or Chinese , certified translations of them are required .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#28:1>
Photostat copies of the documents should also be produced for record
purpose . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#79:2>
<bold> Residential Care Homes &obrack; Elderly Persons &cbrack;
Ordinance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#80:2>
The Residential Care Homes &obrack; Elderly Persons &cbrack;
Ordinance was enacted in October 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#81:2>
It aims to regulate homes established for the residential care of
elderly persons who have attained the age of 60 years .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#82:2>
The Ordinance has come into full operation on June 1 , 1996 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#83:2>
The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that residential care
homes for the elderly provide services of a reasonable standard and that the
welfare of the elderly residents is safeguarded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#84:2>
Under the Ordinance , residential care homes are regulated either
by licence or certificate of exemption . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#85:2>
Licences may be issued to residential care homes which are able
to comply with the requirements in accordance with the Ordinance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#86:2>
The policy of the Social Welfare Department is that all residential
care homes which come into existence and which want to commence operation on
or after April 1 , 1995 should be subject to regulation by the issue of a
licence rather than the issue of a certificate of exemption .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#87:2>
The main reason for the policy is that regulation under a licence
will in the opinion of the Director of Social Welfare , better ensure high
standards of residential care for elderly persons and better safeguard the
interests of elderly residents than will regulation under a certificate of
exemption .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#88:2>
No doubt the Director of Social Welfare will consider applications
for certificates of exemption .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#89:2>
However , it is unlikely that he will , in accordance with the policy
, issue a certificate of exemption for any residential care home which comes
into existence and which is to commence operation on or after April 1 , 1995
unless there is something exceptional in the circumstances which warrant a
departure from the policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-010#90:2>
With regard to certificates of exemption , the policy of the
Social Welfare Department is that they are to be granted to residential care
homes already in operation before April 1 , 1995 but which are unable to
comply fully with the legislative requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#91:2>
The reason is to allow them to continue in operation in the interests
of the residents as well as in the interests of the operators in business
terms .

<ICE-HK:W2D-010#92:2>
If there is danger to the residents or their well-being may be
adversely affected , the procedure for revocation is much simpler than for a
licence . </p> </I>
