<ICE-HK:S1B-014#1:1:A>
I agree that we can postpone the tutorial questions on
deductions to next week alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#2:1:A>
But then I told him that uh I decide not to cancel the tutorial
class today due to the fact that I will consider it  ' s benefit to you by
making use of the time okay ask any question that you come across in the
learning process on any topics or issue that we already cover during the last
lecture <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#3:1:A>
So you are allowed to ask any question or any issue that you have
either in encounter from the textbook or uh from last lecture or even from
tutorial or from tutorial questions

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#4:1:A>
In case if you have no question to ask me <,> because you consider
that well you can grasp all the issues or all the concept or principles then
I will make use of the time to discuss with you the current topic which is
the deduction rule under salary tax okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#5:1:A>
So let me allow you to have <unc> one- word </unc> uh time
to think over concerning with any question that you have <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#6:1:A>
And of course next week then we continue our presentation <,> and
two relevant question will be question uh thirteen and sorry question twelve
and also question thirteen okay on deduction <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#7:1:A>
So so far any problem that you encounter in the learning process <&>
A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#8:1:A>
So let  ' s start from very beginning so how about say for topic one
concerning with general administration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#9:1:A>
The structure of the Inland Revenue Department

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#10:1:A>
The powers of the assessor or the commissioner issue assessment uhm
obtaining information <,> the official secrecy rules <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#11:1:A>
How about say the public tool concerning with uh one direct tax
property tax the scope of charge the <?> estimate </?> of income <,,> <&> A
Cantonese sentence from a student </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#12:1:A>
Uh well let let me remind you because today we have a one visitor
this young lady okay that uh we have to conduct the tutorial in English due
to the fact that uh she is doing some sort of research work concerning with
some sort of uh terms in English that usually lecturer or student used either
in the mass lecture or in the tutorial

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#13:1:A>
Okay I think that research is very useful in the future so that at
least then it may find out the recent or some common terms that you use and
what  ' s the meanings okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#14:1:A>
So that  ' s why then uh if you don't mind then I will suggest then
why not then we we ask the question by English and I will <.> ex </.> explain
to you in English as well unless that you feel problems of course in that
case then perhaps then we can ask the <,> approval first okay <,> so

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#15:1:?> Uh can you explain the case about <unc> two-words
</unc> uh calculation of property tax

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#16:1:A>
Uh calculation of you mean the <?> estimate </?> of the income
the taxable income <,> under property tax okay no problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#17:1:A>
So obviously you know uhm for the <?> estimate </?> of income under
profit tax it should be divided into altogether two stage okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#18:1:A>
So the <.> si </.> the first stage would be the it  ' s talking about
the <?> estimate </?> of the accessible value <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#19:1:A>
Alright and then you got the second stage which is the <?> estimate
</?> of the net accessible value

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#20:1:A>
So by the by the by the word net which means then well it  ' s <,>
from the accessible value you can deduct certain items

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#21:1:A>
So then you got a net amount so we call it call it a net accessible
value okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#22:1:A>
And of course under the revenue law for the <?> estimate </?> of
accessible value then you have to look at the section five big B <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#23:1:A>
And it  ' s start with the subsection two three four and then you got
a five okay and then together with section seven big C <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#24:1:A>
So for this one I think I already explain to you in details uh in
tutorial two that

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#25:1:A>
Well the issue that you have to take into account would be the
subject matter for the <?> estimate </?> of AV is talking about consideration
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#26:1:A>
It  ' s also consideration in money or sometimes in money  ' s worth
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#27:1:A>
Because of the term money  ' s worth then you need to pay attention
to in case if the rent is paid in uh by benefits in kind in lieu of <?> rank
</?> in money then you have to look at whether that benefit in kind would be
so called money  ' s worth or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#28:1:A>
So it  ' s really depends on like say your salary tax depends on
whether that benefit in kind can be either convertible into money or it can
be talking about discharging of uh the landlord  ' s liability that kind of
things okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#29:1:A>
And of course another important issue of <.> co </.> relating to
the <?> estimate </?> of uh accessible value in terms of consideration fee

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#30:1:A>
Then you must have a direct relationship for the purpose for the
payment of consideration and the relationship must be that is for the right
of use of property not for other purposes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#31:1:A>
Alright so then if you satisfy all these condition then the
consideration should be take in account for the <?> estimate </?> of
accessible value okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#32:1:A>
And this section is merely supplement this section only further
elaborate that in that case then if you have <,> a payment made by tenant <,>
to a landlord rather than directly for it  ' s in terms of provision of service
and so on that  ' s would be in included as consideration for the right of use
of property <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#33:1:A>
And then for the for the rest <,> these two text section is talking
about well a treatment of the special item call the premium okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#34:1:A>
So how <?> describe </?> the premium

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#35:1:A>
What  ' s the maximum number of months that you can spread the
premium okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#36:1:A>
And this section obviously is concerning with the bad debt because
<,> due to the principle that well usually the accessibility arises or the
liability arises when you have the rent income payable to you or consider
payable to you okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#37:1:A>
But then subsequently you may discover that I did not receive the
rent <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#38:1:A>
But due to the fact that you have been assessed because it  ' s
payable then you have the liability arises alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#39:1:A>
So they must allow you to have deduction in case if subsequently
you can't receive the rent and then you write off as bad debt okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#40:1:A>
So that  ' s concerning with the <?> estimate </?> of the AV now of
course the next would be section five one big A

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#41:1:A>
This is concerning with the <?> estimate </?> of the net AV and you
know once you got a AV the deduction that you can have would be two items

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#42:1:A>
One item would be in terms of rates and the condition would be
agreed and paid by the <,> landlord alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#43:1:A>
And then I think we already come uh discuss about the situation
that when a tenant <,> pay the rent okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#44:1:A>
Usually if the <?> ten </?> pay the rate which is a usual case in
practice <?> nowaday </?> in the market

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#45:1:A>
When you sign a lease agreement with your landlord normally the
rent so paid by you will be exclusive of rates and lecture fee in other words
the tenant will responsible pay out okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#46:1:A>
So if that  ' s the case normally the rent uh the ratio paid by the
tenant will not be included as income on one hand and it will not be allowed
as deduction on the other hand okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#47:1:A>
The other item for deduction purpose to estimate the net AV will be
the <?> stationary </?> allowance that twenty percent okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#48:1:A>
So that  ' s the law alright and the stages

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#49:1:A>
And of course as a skeleton you can see that in those case and
normally for the calculation of tax taxable income under property tax would
be we may have item like the rent common item and then you may have a premium
<,,> okay and that  ' s being already a portioned according to the three or
four sections okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#50:1:A>
And then you may have some other items okay which is talking about
benefits in kinds <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#51:1:A>
And that  ' s also pay for the right of use of rent okay and then you
come to have a subtotal and then where you can have the deduction of the
irrecoverable <,,> rent if any <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#52:1:A>
And then you got this amount we call it the uh the accessible value
AV

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#53:1:A>
And thereafter you can further deducts first of all is the rates
agreed and paid by you so another deduction and then well <,> then you got
another subtotal alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#54:1:A>
And then you base on that you can further deduct another item which
is this that twenty percent <?> stationary </?> allowance which would be
applied on this subtotal

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#55:1:A>
So you got another one and then the net amount will be so called
the net AV <,> and then base on that you can apply your standard rate and
then you have the property tax <?> liable </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#56:1:A>
So that  ' s normally the skeleton to compute or to <?> estimate </?>
the taxable income under property tax

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#57:1:A>
And of course <,> well different cases then you have different
elements include in this skeleton particularly for the items to be included
as consideration <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#58:1:A>
What are these out <,> are some of the <?> commoned </?> items like
rent premium okay or sometimes you may have golden watch golden ring diamond
ring okay these benefit in kind okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#59:1:A>
Of course then you may have some sort of peculiar item I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#60:1:A>
It  ' s case by case case by case okay depends on circumstances but
any how then well when you look at whether this element will be included as a
consideration for the purpose of estimating the AV or not then go back to the
ornament in the statue

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#61:1:A>
Okay see whether it satisfy your condition whether it can said to
be it may worth and the most important would be whether it  ' s for the right
of use of property or not <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#62:1:A>
So so did I answer your question

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#63:1:?> Uhm uhm I want to uhm <,> uhm uhm more about the case which is
presented by Miss Cheung

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#64:1:A>
You mean the tutorial question

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#65:1:?> Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#66:1:A>
Which one <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#67:1:A>
Question uh we have altogether two uh property tax uh altogether uh
three so four five question four question four and question six

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#68:1:A>
So which one <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#69:1:A>
Question five <,> question five

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#70:1:A>
You want to know what the whole question or which item <&> A long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#71:1:A>
So the main theme of this question is really talking about you have
a a landlord or owner of a property

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#72:1:?> Uh about question four

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#73:1:A>
Question four okay

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#74:1:?> Question four or five <&> Several replies </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#75:1:A>
Well indeed what  ' s what  ' s what  ' s what  ' s the point of issue
so it  ' s relating to what relating to <&> Several replies and a long pause
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#76:1:A>
What <&> Several replies </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#77:1:A>
<?> Unrelieve </?> rent okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#78:1:A>
So in this particular case we must be question five then alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#79:1:A>
So in question five then obviously you can see that well first of
all you got a landlord or owner of a property who lend out his property for
rental income purpose alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#80:1:A>
And then he receive a premium as well as monthly rent and the the
rate was paid by the tenant alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#81:1:A>
But then <,> no the the rate was paid by the landlord the owner
alright and then unfortunately <,> on thirty first of March ninety one the
tenant vacate the flat with six months rent in a rear okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#82:1:A>
And then the landlord lost the contact on <?> whereabout </?> of uh
Mr Lo

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#83:1:A>
He can't find him and finally he learn that uh that tenant left
Hong Kong in July ninety one okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#84:1:A>
So then I think that  ' s the the point of issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#85:1:A>
So obviously in this case then you know that there altogether six
months rent in a rear so the rent become payable but actually the landlord or
the owner did not receive the rent alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#86:1:A>
And of course according to the wording under the statute because it
emphasizes on payable then we say that in a year which is obviously ninety
ninety one the year in question in nineteen ninety one

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#87:1:A>
Then you still have to assess the landlord or the owner in respect
of that six months rent

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#88:1:A>
Because although he did not receive it but the rent satisfy the
word payable

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#89:1:A>
The rent was still and is payable okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#90:1:A>
So in that case and for nineteen ninety one the six months rent
should be included in the <?> estimate </?> of AV first

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#91:1:A>
It  ' s only up to say in July ninety one when the landlord or the
owner learn that the tenant the ex-tenant left Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#92:1:A>
Then we say that in this case he can satisfy that he prove to the
assessor that the rent so in a rear become irrecoverable <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#93:1:A>
Okay so then he can make use of the section seven big C subsection
one okay and then claim deduction of the irrecoverable rent but now the year
in concern is the following year which is the year ninety one ninety two okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#94:1:A>
And the remaining question obviously would be when you look at
ninety one ninety two <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#95:1:A>
You are entitled to claim irrecoverable rent so you well let  ' s
assume that this is ninety one ninety two

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#96:1:A>
So you can have the deduction okay here

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#97:1:A>
The remaining question is whether the income this subtotal would be
sufficient to absorb the <?> proper </?> rent or not okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#98:1:A>
So then you have you have to read the rest of the question and then
later on you discover that well after the vacation the property uh was <?>
relet </?> on the first January only for the last three months only and then
on nominal rent only

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#99:1:A>
So that  ' s why they the income this subtotal will become only well
uh thirty thousand isn't it <{> <[> by </[> five thousand <,> yes five
thousand per month okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#100:1:A>
So you can only deduct thirty thousand only <,> alright out of
that six months in <?> proper </?> rent okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#101:1:A>
And then of course then for those <?> unrelieve </?> amount
according to the section seven big C subsection three then you can what

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#102:1:A>
You can carry backward and set out against the most recent year AV
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#103:1:A>
And of course in this case <,> other than you got the nominal rent
when you <?> relet </?> your property you also have the tax payer uh that is
the tenant the ex-tenant return to Hong Kong and he agree to pay the rent in
a rear in the past back to you but by free instalment okay and then you you
you also have the dealing section that if the rent is subsequently recover
and that has been written off before then the subsequent recover recovery of
rent will deem to be a consideration and and item for the AV purpose

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#104:1:A>
So that  ' s why in addition to the this fifteen thousand you may
also have to add uh one third of the rent recover okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-014#105:1:A>
So that  ' s <,> the computation of the A net AV so I don't know
whether this is your particular point or not or perhaps uh you can point out
well which uh item you you can't understand then I can elaborate more on on
the issue

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-014#106:1:?> <[> Yes </[> </{> </I>
