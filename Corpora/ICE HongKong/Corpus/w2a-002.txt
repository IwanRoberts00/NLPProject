<bold> Re(-)presenting the Unconscious : From Sigmund Freud to Fredric
Jameson </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#3:1>
The unconscious is what cannot be represented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#4:1>
Representation denotes a conscious activity to re-construct the past
from the present , to textualize the Real by the Symbolic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#5:1>
It either pre-supposes language as an adequate medium for
substitutions , or as a valid source of authenticity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#6:1>
Yet the chain of signifiers may indulge in its own play and
disseminate to whatever directions according to different specific cultural
contexts .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#7:1>
Being distorted and distanced , the unconscious remains outside the
rhetoric of language and beyond its tropological displacement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#8:1>
If the unconscious is what cannot be represented , yet it simply
re-presents itself in its <it> <foreign> mise en scene . </foreign> </it>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#9:1>
The present does not re-constitute the past , nor can the Symbolic
reproduce the Real .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#10:1>
Rather , it is the pastness of the past which takes over the
presentness of the present , the return of the repressed &obrack; <it>
<foreign> Wiederholungszwang </foreign> </it> &cbrack; which overwhelms the
consciousness of the conscious self .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#11:1>
Back to the labyrinth of the primal scene , the self re-lives the
primordial experience of union and separation , of joy and trauma .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#12:1>
In such a terrible encounter , the unconscious articulates its own
presence as the other of the self . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#13:1>
I. Representing the psycho-somatic unconscious </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#14:1>
In <it> The Interpretation of Dreams </it> , Sigmund Freud tries
to represent that otherness of the self , which re-presents itself in dreams .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#15:1>
He claims that &ldquo; <quote> there cannot be any dreams but wishful
dreams </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 214 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#16:1>
Dreams are interpreted as wish fulfilments , not of the ego , but of
something other than the ego .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#17:1>
Unfulfilled sexual drives &obrack; <it> <foreign> triebe </foreign>
</it> &cbrack; doubly repressed in day time by an internalized super-ego and
the eternal world become latent dream-thoughts stored in the unconscious
psyche .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#18:1>
Via materials taken from the immediate dream-day , they re-articulate
themselves in their own language , one which involves the work of
condensation and displacement as disguise .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#19:1>
To interpret dreams means to decode such a system of representation
and to uncover its hidden cause .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#20:1>
To represent what has been re-presented , <foreign> <it> wo Es war ,
soll Ich werden </it> </foreign> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#21:1>
Where id was , there shall ego be ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#22:1>
C. G. Jung , in <it> The Archetypes and the Collective
Unconscious </it> , extends Freud  ' s personal unconscious to collective
unconscious , male and female sexual symbols to archetypes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#23:1>
In <it> Dreams </it> , he insists that dreams , besides having a
regressive cause , have a progressive purpose , not just as wish fulfilments
, but also with compensatory and corrective functions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#24:1>
For him , &ldquo; <quote> the symbol in the dream has more the value
of a parable : it does not conceal , it teaches </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 32
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#25:1>
What was forgotten at the moment or what was repressed in the past
returns to consciousness in dreams , helping men to re-gain the balance of a
healthy mind .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#26:1>
Literature , like myth , represents a corrective and collective
archetypal dream . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#27:1>
When Jacques Lacan calls for &ldquo; <quote> the return to Freud
</quote> &ldquo; &obrack; <it> &EACUTE;crits </it> : 57 &cbrack; , he means
to return to Freud  ' s representation of the unconscious .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#28:1>
In <it> The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-analysis </it> , he
re-defines the Freudian unconscious as a regressive desire , aiming at a
re-union with the primordial &obrack; m)Other .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#29:1>
Traces of such a primordial union &obrack; <foreign> <it> les
d&eacute;rives de la jouissance </it> </foreign> &cbrack; generate a
progressive chain of substitutions to fill in the lack .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#30:1>
Sex is understood less as an instinctual need than the desire
of/for the Other &obrack; <foreign> <it> le d&eacute;sir de l'Autre </it>
</foreign> &cbrack; , &obrack; mis)represented by the substitutive chain of
part-objects &obrack; <foreign> <it> objet a </it> </foreign> &cbrack; and
signifiers , and then &obrack; mis)recognized by the subject &obrack; <foreign> <it>
je </it> </foreign> &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#31:1>
In Book 2 of The Seminar of Jacques Lacan , the process of
self-(re)cognition is represented by the following schema , the so-called
schema L : <O> diagram </O> </p> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#32:1>
The subject &obrack; S &cbrack; &obrack; mis)recognizes itself &obrack;
Es &cbrack; as a totalized ego &obrack; a &cbrack; through the other  ' s
&obrack; a ' &cbrack; gaze .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#33:1>
Such an imaginary &obrack; mis)understanding of oneself in the Mirror Stage
becomes the primal scene which structures all future understandings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#34:1>
In the Symbolic Stage , it even develops into a wall of language
which blocks the unconscious message from the Other &obrack; A &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#35:1>
The Other re-presents itself , yet interrupted by the other  ' s
representation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#36:1>
What can be understood is foreclosed by misunderstandings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#37:1>
It is not impossible to understand .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#38:1>
It is understanding which is impossible , for understanding is always
already a misunderstanding &obrack; <foreign> <it> m&eacute;connaissance
</it> </foreign> &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#39:1>
II. Representing the socio-political unconscious </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#40:1>
As Michel Foucault tries to represent sexuality in terms of his
genealogical history , he aims to demonstrate that the conscious knowledge on
sex is over-determined by the unconscious intentionality of power .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#41:1>
For him , &ldquo; <quote> power created sexuality as a device to say
no to sex </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; Gordon 190 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#42:1>
In Vol. 1 of <it> The History of Sexuality </it> , he explains the
schematic transformation of sex into the discourse of sexuality in Western
society : <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X43:1>
<quote> Not only did it speak of sex and compel everyone to do so;
it also set out to formulate the uniform truth of sex... .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X44:1>
As if it needed this production of truth .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X45:1>
As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not only in an economy
of pleasure but in an ordered system of knowledge &obrack; 69 &cbrack; .
</quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#46:1>
Therefore , sex is not repressed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#47:1>
It is &obrack; mis)represented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#48:1>
More than being transformed in the discursive environment , it is in
fact being translated into another language . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#49:1>
In &ldquo; The Order of Discourse, &rdquo; Foucault examines the
strategies of exclusion , rarefaction and appropriation which function as
power apparatuses to control , select , organize and redistribute the
production of discourse .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#50:1>
In the discursive field , one may see how sex is controlled and
selected by the three great systems of exclusion : the forbidden speech , the
division of madness and the will to truth &semi; organized and defined in
terms of the principles of rarefaction : commentary-principle ,
author-principle and disciplines &semi; delimited and redistributed according
to the condition of circulation and transmission .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#51:1>
In this sense , the discourse of sexuality is not the locus for the
understanding of sex , but the field where the multiplicity of power
relations is revealed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#52:1>
Similar to Foucault , Louis Althusser  ' s history of power also
functions in the form of apparatuses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#53:1>
In his article &ldquo; Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses
&obrack; Notes towards an Investigation &cbrack; , &rdquo; Althusser
postulates &ldquo; <quote> a plurality of Ideological State Apparatuses
</quote> &ldquo; : the religious ISA , the educational ISA , the family ISA ,
the legal ISA , the political ISA , the trade-union ISA , the communications
ISA , the cultural ISA , etc . &obrack; 143,144 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#54:1>
Unlike the State apparatus which can be experienced in tangible forms
of repressive agencies , the Ideological State Apparatuses function
unconsciously , being already installed and inscribed in various
institutionalized social practices .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#55:1>
Ideology exists and can only exist &ldquo; <quote> in a material
ideological apparatus , prescribing material practices governed by a material
ritual </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 170 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#56:1>
Of the relationship between ideology and its representation ,
&ldquo; <quote> <it> ideology in general has no history </it> </quote>
&ldquo; though &ldquo; <quote> ideologies <it> have a history of their own
</it> </quote> . &rdquo; &obrack; 160 , 161 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#57:1>
Men cannot represent ideology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#58:1>
Instead , ideology is the system of representation by which &ldquo;
<quote> men represent their real conditions of existence to themselves in an
imaginary form </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 163 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#59:1>
Through an ideological mirror , individuals are constituted as
subjects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#60:1>
Ideology is the unconscious means of structuration by which men
(mis)understand their world and locate themselves in society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#61:1>
Yet , such an imaginary &obrack; mis)understanding has its material bases :
<X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X62:1>
<quote> &obrack; A subject  ' s &cbrack; ideas are his material
actions inserted into material practices governed by material rituals which
are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which
derive the ideas of that subject &obrack; 169 &cbrack; . </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#63:1>
Ideology is what cannot be represented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#64:1>
But its material social formations &obrack; i.e. , the ISAs &cbrack;
have a history of their own . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#65:1>
III. Representing the historico-cultural unconscious </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#66:1>
In <it> The Political Unconscious : Narrative as a Socially
Symbolic Act </it> , Fredric Jameson tries to re-historicize the
hermeneutical readings of literary works in terms of his political
unconscious .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#67:1>
He regards the political perspective of understanding as the &ldquo;
<quote> absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation </quote>
&ldquo; &obrack; 17 &cbrack; . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X68:1>
His argument : <quote> accordingly turns on the dynamics of the act
of interpretation and presupposes , as its organizational fiction , that we
never really confront a text immediately , in all its freshness as a
thing-in-itself .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X69:1>
Rather , texts come before us as the always-already-read; we
apprehend them through sedimented layers of previous interpretation , or - if
the text is brand-new - through the sedimented reading habits and categories
developed by those inherited interpretative traditions &obrack; Preface : 9
&cbrack; . </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#70:1>
So to speak , a literary text embodies a cultural history of its
understanding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#71:1>
The act of reading and interpretation necessarily has to pass through
the traces of previous readings and interpretations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#72:1>
In the process , a new allegorical code is established to re-write
old traditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#73:1>
The struggle among theories for hermeneutical domination and mastery
implicates the politics involved in the history of readings and
interpretations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#74:1>
The history of &obrack; mis)understanding , according to Jameson ,
signifies the cultural repression of a collective Story : <X> <quote>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X75:1>
&ldquo; for Marxism , the collective struggle to wrest a realm of
Freedom from a realm of Necessity &rdquo; &obrack; 19 &cbrack; . </quote>
</X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#76:1>
To detect &ldquo; <quote> the traces of that uninterrupted narrative
</quote> &ldquo; and to restore &ldquo; <quote> to the surface of the text
the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history </quote> &ldquo;
&obrack; 20 &cbrack; , a Marxist perspective of political readings has to be
adopted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#77:1>
A literary text must be located within a three-layered hermeneutical
framework so that its &ldquo; <quote> repressed and buried </quote> &ldquo;
cultural unconscious can re-present itself in different horizons of
understandings : <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X78:1>
<quote> &obrack;F&cbrack;irst , of political history , in the narrow
sense of punctual event and a chroniclelike sequence of happenings in time;
then of society , in the now already less diachronic and time-bound sense of
a constitutive tension and struggle between social classes; and , ultimately
, of history now conceived in its vastest sense of the sequence of modes of
production and the succession and destiny of the various human social
formations , from prehistoric life to whatever for future history has in
store for us &obrack; 75 &cbrack; . </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#79:1>
The focus of study in the three layers of concentric horizons can be
summarized as the historical or ideological subtext , the social <it>
ideologeme </it> and the ideology of form . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#80:1>
In the horizon of political history , history is narrowly defined
as political events or haphazard happenings represented in chronological
order .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#81:1>
It is not the general background against which a literary work is
written , but an ideologically-informed textualized reality which a literary
work actively transforms and re-writes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#82:1>
Therefore , during interpretations , &ldquo; <quote> the individual
work is grasped essentially as a symbolic act </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 76
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#83:1>
It reconstructs &ldquo; <quote> a prior historical or ideological
subtext </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 81 and provides &ldquo; <quote> symbolic
resolutions of real political and social contradictions </quote> &ldquo;
&obrack; 80 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#84:1>
The text re-writes its subtext in the same way as interpretation
re-writes the text .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#85:1>
It both enacts and represses irreconcilable political and social
contradictions inherent in its historical and ideological subtext . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#86:1>
In the social horizon , the individual text has to be interpreted
and re-written as a class discourse .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#87:1>
The textualized presence of a single voice pre-supposes an entire
system of representation for its understanding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#88:1>
If the individual text is a <it> <foreign> parole </foreign> </it> ,
then the discursive social context will be its <it> <foreign> langue
</foreign> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#89:1>
They are relational and dialogic , if not oppositional and
antagonistic . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X90:1>
Developing his theory from Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakhtin instead of
Ferdinand de Saussure or Roman Jakobson , Jameson claims that : <quote>
&obrack; I &cbrack; t will be necessary to add the qualification that the
normal form of the dialogical is essentially and antagonistic one , and that
the dialogues of class struggle is one in which two opposing discourses fight
it out within the general unity of a shared code &obrack; 84 &cbrack; . </X>
</quote>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#91:1>
The text is the field of class struggle , between the hegemonic sound
and its repressed silence , or between the network of domination and its
marginalized resistance . </p>

<p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X92:1>
The minimal unit for the larger class discourse is what Jameson
calls ideologeme , which <quote> manifest(s &cbrack; itself either
as a pseudoidea - a conceptual or belief system , an abstract value , an
opinion or prejudice - Or as a protonarrative , a kind of ultimate class
fantasy about the collective characters ' which are the classes in opposition
&obrack; </quote> 87 &cbrack; . </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#93:1>
In other words , <it> ideologemes </it> are the units of ideological
representation by which one &obrack; mis)understands the collective
characters of one  ' s own class .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#94:1>
They are fundamentally narrative in character , having their &ldquo;
<quote> capacity to mediate between conceptions of ideology as abstract
opinion , class value , and the like </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 87 &cbrack;
and their concrete protonarrative manifestations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#95:1>
In the ultimate horizon of History , the literary text as
embedded within a larger socio-cultural process is re-considered in terms of
conflicting modes of productions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#96:1>
Jameson  ' s notion of the mode of production does not follow that of
the diachronic succession of modes : <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#X97:1>
<quote> Primitive communism or tribal society &obrack; the horde
&cbrack; , the gens or hierarchical kinship societies &obrack; neolithic
society &cbrack; , the Asiatic mode of production &obrack; so-called Oriental
despotism &cbrack; , the polis or an oligarchical slaveholding society
&obrack; the ancient mode of production &cbrack; , feudalism , capitalism ,
and communism &obrack; 89 &cbrack; . </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#98:1>
Nor does is resemble that of Poulantzas  '  synchronic &ldquo; <quote>
coexistence of several modes of production all at once </quote> &ldquo;
&obrack; 95 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#99:1>
Instead , what is synchronic has to open to history in a dialectical
way while what is diachronic has to be re-considered in a synchronic or
metasynchronic manner .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#100:1>
The individual text is &ldquo; <quote> crisscrossed and intersected
by a variety of impulses from contradictory modes of cultural production all
at once </quote> &ldquo; &obrack; 95 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#101:1>
It re-presents the historical juncture of simultaneous conflicting
motives among different modes of cultural productions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#102:1>
Here , Jameson proposes his concept of cultural revolution as
the &ldquo; <quote> moment in which the coexistence of various modes of
production becomes visibly antagonistic , their contradictions moving to the
very center of political , social , and historical life </quote> &obrack; 95
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#103:1>
It marks the juncture of competition between the dominant mode of
production with sedimented layers of archaic structures and emergent means of
new productive schemes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#104:1>
In the ultimate horizon of historical Necessity , both the subtexts
and the ideologemes have to be understood in an enlarged socio-cultural
scheme as the ideology of form , which refers to &ldquo; <quote> the
determinate contradiction of the specific messages emitted by the varied sign
systems </quote> &obrack; 98 &cbrack; ... &ldquo; <quote> which are
themselves traces or anticipations of modes of production </quote> &ldquo;
&obrack; 76 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#105:1>
History in the sense of a collective human struggle and as a process
of socio-cultural contradictions becomes the ultimate possibility for human
understandings . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#106:1>
IV. On unconscious : from psycho-somatic to
socio-political/historico-cultural representations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#107:1>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#108:1>
From Sigmund Freud to Fredric Jameson , one can see the shrift
the focus in the representation of the unconscious from an individual  ' s
repressed psyche to a collective being  ' s repressed History .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#109:1>
What was originally understood as the symbolic dream of a family
romance becomes a discursive field of political conflicts and ideological
struggles in society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#110:1>
The notion of an individual text develops from being the manifest
content of some latent dream-thoughts to the historical and cultural dialogue
between an articulated discourse and its repressed silence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#111:1>
Textual interpretations also change from the psychiatric attention
paid to the hidden level of meaning beneath the text to the critical
awareness of sedimented layers of larger socio-cultural processes which
envelop and encompass the text . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-002#112:1>
To represent the unconscious means to re-construct a history for
what is outside history .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#113:1>
One has to rely on the adequacy and validity of language which in
itself is neither adequate as a medium of representation nor valid as a
documentation of truth .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#114:1>
The history of understanding is in fact a Story of misunderstandings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#115:1>
If the test of the psycho-linguistic Labyrinth is that one can only
understand through misunderstandings , it is also the outlet which History
finds its way out .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#116:1>
The unconscious is what cannot be represented .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#117:1>
But in the mirror of language , History re-presents itself as the
Other , out of whatever misguided and disguised form of imaginary
representations in the process of cultural disseminations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#118:1>
Only in the possibility of the socio-cultural contexts can one
experience the impossibility of the individual text .

<ICE-HK:W2A-002#119:1>
The moment of aporia is also the moment when consciousness
encounters its unconscious self . </p> </I>
