<h> <bold> No longer are extramarital relationships a man  ' s domain in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#3:1>
Women are looking for more equality on all fronts , indulging in
affairs and leaving their shocked partners to deal with the fallout .

<p> <bold> JIMMY  ' s LOVE AFFAIR </bold> with his wife began in 1986 when he
went to a doctor about a cold and fell instantly in love with his nurse .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#6:1>

<p>  ' She was gentle and very beautiful, ' the 38-year-old-policeman says ,
smiling .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#7:1>
Four years later , they were married . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#8:1>

<p> Then , in 1999 , he discovered she was having an affair .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#9:1>
'I didn't know what to do , I couldn't sleep , and I kept thinking
about why this was happening to me, ' he says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#10:1>

<p> While Hong Kong women have long been portrayed as the victims of
infidelity , the Caritas Family Service Project on Extramarital Affairs says
more men are calling its hotline for help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#11:1>
Since 1995 , the number of calls from men has rocketed from one or
two per month to about 200 out of a total of 1,000 , according to team leader
Paulina Kwok Chi-ying . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#12:1>


<p> The modern concubine has been popular with Hong Kong men since the 1980s
, when the mainland began opening up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#13:1>
Many married men working or travelling across the border set up
mistresses in apartments , taking advantage of the cheaper property prices
and a lower cost of living . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#14:1>

<p> Now the tables have been turned as women become more independent and
embrace Western values , says Kwok .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#15:1>
They want to have relationships based on equality . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#16:1>

<p> A rise in the number of women in the workforce has also led to an
increase in liaisons .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#17:1>
In one case , a construction worker in his 30s lost his insurance-
broker wife after she had an affair with a colleague .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#18:1>
Another man , unemployed , whose wife was a cleaner at a restaurant ,
lost her when she went to live with a kitchen hand .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#20:1>
'In the past , women tended to think that after they got married they
should be loyal to their husbands whatever happened , but this attitude has
changed, ' says Lam Wai-ha , external organiser of the Association for the
Advancement of Feminism . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#21:1>

<p> Social workers agree that any relationship lacking a good foundation will
come under pressure and is likely to suffer ongoing conflict .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#22:1>
'When a marriage is not good , couples argue a lot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#23:1>
The woman feels frustrated and can easily be tempted to fall into the
arms of another man who appears to care for her more than her husband, ' says
Cheung Pui-ling , a social worker with the Hong Kong Family Welfare Society ,
which has also noted an increase in married women having affairs in recent
years . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#24:1>

<p> Such behaviour is far from the traditional image of honourable Chinese
women .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#25:1>
History depicts married women who had affairs as evil .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#26:1>
In ancient times , in some villages an unfaithful wife and her lover
would be locked in a bamboo pig cage and drowned in a river . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#27:1>

<p> But societies which once turned a blind eye to - or even encouraged - men  ' s
infidelity , while demonising women who do the same thing , are having their
moral ground rules redefined .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#28:1>
As in the West , female adultery is becoming more common . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#29:1>

<p> Rights workers suggest that society shouldn't see the trend of women  ' s
extra-marital affairs as  ' bad ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#30:1>
'We are not encouraging married women to have affairs , but they
should be given the choice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#31:1>
It is better than being trapped in an unhappy marriage; that can have
tragic consequences .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#32:1>
A woman should be able to decide her own fate, ' Lam says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#33:1>

<p> In Chinese communities , men whose wives have affairs are dubbed as  ' wearing
a green hat ' and they feel an extreme loss of face .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#34:1>
In the Yuan dynasty &obrack; 1206 to 1368 &cbrack; , criminals and
prostitutes were ordered to wear green headscarves as a sign of shame .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#35:1>
Men whose wives were adulterous were called  ' green cloths ' and
prostitutes ' parents and male relatives also had to wear green clothes . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#36:1>

<p> But Dr Virginia Yip Choy-yin , associate professor of linguistics ,
department of modern languages and intercultural studies at Hong Kong  ' s
Chinese University , says the term , especially designed for  ' wronged'
husbands , is  ' language sexism ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#37:1>
'If a married woman has an affair , society finds it remarkable and
creates a phrase to describe &obrack; the husband's &cbrack; suffering , but
there is no reverse of it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#38:1>
They don't make a phrase for wives whose husbands have affairs - the
women are not seen as victimised - because society thinks men having affairs
is acceptable, ' Yip says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#39:1>

<p> Social workers say the cases they receive may only be the tip of the
iceberg as many men , unlike women , refuse to seek help because of the
stigma .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#40:1>
They are rarely able to talk to friends or family about the pain of
their personal situations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#41:1>
It can lead to violence and sometimes death .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#42:1>
Kwok says:  ' Men have nowhere to release their anger , and as it
builds up , they can become very dangerous .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#43:1>
They can hurt themselves or others. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#44:1>

<p> Social workers fear that if female affairs become as prevalent as male
cases , it will have a  ' serious impact on society ' , ripping families apart
and leading to more neglected children .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#45:1>
The cuckold husbands , as you would expect , come from all walks of
life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#46:1>
Mostly in their 30s and 40s , they share similar emotions: anger and
shock , shame and helplessness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#47:1>
'They don't know how to talk to their wives , and many call us and
cry, ' Kwok says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#48:1>
'They tend to think their wives go to find other men because they are
useless , because they can't satisfy them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#49:1>
They blame themselves for not earning enough money , they feel that
they have failed. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#50:1>

<p> Jimmy is ostensibly a cheerful man , but when he talks about his 34-
year-old wife , he is embarrassed and looks away .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#51:1>
'I didn't tell my friends or work mates , not even my parents, ' he
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#52:1>
'I don't earn as much as him , I am only a poor policeman , he is an
engineer, ' he adds , referring to the third party .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#53:1>
In December 1999 , his wife , by now a clerk for a property
management company , met a 47-year-old engineer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#54:1>
Soon after , she started coming home late ,  ' working overtime ' and
going out with  ' friends ' at weekends .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#55:1>
She also started wearing more expensive clothes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#56:1>
'One morning , she said she wanted to go out to have tea with friends .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#57:1>
I asked her to sleep more and not to go , but she suddenly cried ,
and it was then I suspected something. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#58:1>

<p> Not all the so-called  ' home wreckers ' are richer or have better jobs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#59:1>
Some are less well-off and the women end up giving them money . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#60:1>

<p> Trading company clerk Albert is 32 and lives in Tuen Mun .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#61:1>
He has a three-year-old son .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#62:1>
His wife , a piano teacher in her early 30s , had an affair with one
of her students , who was in his 20s . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#63:1>

<p>  ' My wife came back one day and said a student had a crush on her .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#64:1>
I told her that was unlikely, ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#65:1>
A week after she returned from a trip to Guangzhou with her students
, including her admirer , she told Albert she had fallen for another man .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#66:1>

<p>  ' I was very shocked , and I didn't know what to say to her .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#67:1>
We had been together for more than 10 years , but she had only known
him for several months, ' he says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#68:1>

<p> Albert tried many ways to save his marriage: taking his wife on holidays
to give her a break from seeing the man; being more considerate and loving ,
but to no avail .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#69:1>
They have just divorced .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#70:1>
When Albert describes his anguish , tears well up in his eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#71:1>
'I didn't know what to do to make her stay , and felt hopeless, ' he
says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#72:1>

<p> Ah Wah , a 50-year-old construction worker , didn't go to work for days
after discovering his wife was having an affair .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#73:1>
'Why me? ' he kept asking himself . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#74:1>

<p> Ah Wah lived in a Tai Po village and fell in love with his neighbour when
he was 30 and she was 17 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#75:1>
After dating for five years , they married in 1985 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#76:1>
'She is very pure and kind hearted .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#77:1>
Everyone in the village said to me ,  ' You must feel like you have won
the Mark Six to have married her ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#78:1>
I thought so too, ' he says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#79:1>

<p> They are still together and Ah Wah says he continues to treat his wife
well .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#80:1>
'I remember to buy her flowers and cards on her birthdays, ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#81:1>
He says she also cares about him and buys him clothing and cooks good
food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#82:1>
They have a son , 12 , and a six-year-old daughter . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#83:1>

<p> In 1992 , the family moved to the city in a Sha Tin public housing estate
, and he noticed that she started wearing more fashionable clothes and
putting on more make-up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#84:1>
In 1998 , the signs got worse .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#85:1>
She was reluctant to talk to him and lost interest in sex . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#86:1>

<p> Ah Wah first learnt that his wife had affairs after friends told him they
had seen her in karaoke houses and bars with various men .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#87:1>
Ah Wah isn't angry with his wife , but himself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#88:1>
'I blame myself for the problem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#89:1>
I am old and earn little money from my job, ' he says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#90:1>

<p> The Social Welfare Department has no specific programme to help the
husbands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#91:1>
Caritas is fighting a lone battle to offer them some support .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#92:1>
Recently it restarted a five-session self-help programme for husbands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#93:1>
The reluctance of husbands to come forward makes it more difficult
for the potential helpers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#94:1>
Two years ago , a similar programme was dropped because nobody came
forward . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#95:1>

<p>  ' When we reorganised this programme recently , seven registered , but
most of them withdrew in the end .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#96:1>
Some said they had no time , others were simply too embarrassed,'
says Kevin Kwan , the social worker who helped to initiate the programme .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#97:1>
Three remain - Jimmy , Albert and Ah Wah . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#98:1>

<p> Caritas has printed more than 5,000 leaflets , distributing them to
charities , social groups , hospitals , private companies and workshops ,
encouraging husbands to seek help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#99:1>
In the group sessions they describe what happened to them in the form
of a tale .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#100:1>
Other members of the group give the story teller their thoughts
about why the marriage didn't work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#101:1>
'We rarely tell them what to do , they are the ones to accept
themselves , and find their own solutions to face the future, ' Kwan says .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#102:1>

<p> With the help of Caritas , the three men are well on their way to
overcoming their problems .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#103:1>
Albert urges other husbands to seek help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#104:1>
'At least then you have a channel to release your feelings and the
pressure. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#105:1>

<p> Ah Wah is determined to end his 20-year relationship .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#106:1>
'She doesn't love me any more , it is meaningless to be together .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#107:1>
I said to her ,  ' If you have found someone who can give you a better
future , I will leave you'. ' He tells husbands not to be angry when they find
out .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#108:1>
'They should be calm .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#109:1>
Anger cannot solve problems .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#110:1>
Don't keep asking yourself why .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#111:1>
Find help. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#112:1>

<p> Caritas team leader Kwok says it is impossible to guarantee extramarital
affairs will not happen but there are ways to help prevent them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#113:1>
Before getting married , couples should be honest about themselves
and their expectations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#114:1>
After marriage , they should communicate more , open up to each
other and not hide their feelings .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#115:1>
'They should discuss issues to enhance their understanding of each
other .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#116:1>
But even when affairs happen , stay calm and talk. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#117:1>

<p> Sometimes fractured relationships do mend .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#118:1>
Divorce is not inevitable and some wives return to their husbands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#119:1>
Others don't know how to deal with the problem and just let the
situation drag on .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#120:1>
'Some have talked the problems over but still can't accept the other
person , and the couple feel immense pain to be together .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#121:1>
In such cases it is better they get divorced, ' Kwok says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#122:1>

<p> So what about Jimmy ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#123:1>
After more than two years of struggle with the heartache , he
decided to make a clean break from his 12-year marriage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#124:1>
Since May , his wife has not returned home .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#125:1>
'I still love her a lot .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#126:1>
But there needs to be an end, ' he says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#131:2>

<p> Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung put off his big smiles last
week as he began his campaign for public support for a four-year plan to
balance the books .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#132:2>
On Thursday - one day after he announced the 2003-04 Budget , he
offered an apology to the Hong Kong people who are unhappy with the
government  ' s performance . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#133:2>

<p> As public discontent boiled following the unveiling of plans to raise
taxes , Mr Leung kept his emotions in check on television and radio
programmes , talking slowly and calmly as he made a plea for public
understanding and sympathy . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#134:2>

<p> In the face of the intensity of the anger , as was evident in remarks
made by callers to phone-in programmes , he knew he had no choice but to take
a bow and say sorry , before the public  ' s anger spilled over . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#135:2>

<p> As Mr Leung reflects over the weekend on the post-Budget reaction , he
should find no difficulty in deciphering the messages from the populace .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#136:2>
First , many people are prepared to &ldquo; make a sacrifice &rdquo;
to help alleviate the severe budgetary deficit - despite the fact that the
planned raises in salaries tax are by no means mild . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#137:2>


<p> Second , people feel much more strongly about what they deem to be the
government  ' s failure to make its share of sacrifices by trimming expenditure .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#138:2>

<p> Although the government has committed itself to reducing expenditure by
&dollar;20 billion by 2006-07 , the community remains highly sceptical of its
sincerity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#139:2>
&obrack; Under the plan , the government hopes to raise &dollar;20
billion through tax revenue , plus an additional &dollar;30 billion from a 3
per cent growth in the economy &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#140:2>
Given the volatility of economic forecasts , there are lingering
doubts among the public that they might be the ones who have to shoulder a
much bigger burden . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#141:2>

<p> While accepting the tax rises , they are putting more pressure on the
government to take more drastic measures to curb spending . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#142:2>

<p> Third , people  ' s reaction to the Budget has inevitably been influenced
by their overall feelings about the performance of the Tung administration .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#143:2>
With grievances over the government running deep and wide , the
Budget blueprint has become an easy target for people to count old scores and
vent their frustration . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#144:2>

<p> Some angry callers challenged whether their taxes had been spent wisely ,
claiming the government had failed to deliver sound , cost-effective policies
and services in education and health .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#145:2>
One caller cited the public housing piling scandal that resulted in
a multi-million-dollar demolition of three nearly completed buildings in Sha
Tin . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#146:2>

<p> In view of the severity of the deficit , the budgetary proposals to raise
taxes are likely to be approved , even though there will be loud noises made
against the measures from inside and outside Legco .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#147:2>
Moreover , political pressure will build for Mr Leung to make deeper
cuts in government spending in the next few years . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#148:2>

<p> That sounds like a daunting task for Mr Leung , who has probably made
more enemies than friends in the civil service since he took up the post of
financial chief in May 2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#149:2>
From day one , civil servants greeted his appointment with
scepticism , mistrust and anxiety . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#150:2>

<p> Many point to his &ldquo; big-bang &rdquo; approach in championing
education reform when he was chairman of the Education Commission and fear a
similar approach would turn the civil service on its head .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#151:2>
For his part , Mr Leung has made no secret of his intention to push
for structural and cultural changes to the civil service under the " three Rs
&rdquo; - reprioritising , reorganising and re-engineering . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#152:2>

<p> In the 2003-04 Budget , he highlighted the principle of &ldquo; big
market , small government &rdquo; as one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong  ' s
development .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#153:2>
&ldquo; The resources we are using come from the public .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#154:2>
We must use them cost-effectively , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#155:2>

<p> Undoubtedly , growing pressure from society for Mr Leung to take more
forceful measures to cut spending will put him in a more difficult and
vulnerable position within the bureaucracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#156:2>
But it could also be a blessing in disguise if he can turn the
pressure into vigour for change . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#157:2>

<p> Balancing the budget by 2006-07 has emerged as one of the key tasks for
Mr Leung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-014#158:2>
It will be no small achievement if he succeeds in turning the slogan
of &ldquo; doing more with less &rdquo; into reality at the end of his five-year
term . </p>
