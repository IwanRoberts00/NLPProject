<ICE-HK:W2A-001#3:1>
Some time ago at an Asian theological seminar I read a paper with
the title , &ldquo; Can Theologians Dance on the Top of a Pin ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#4:1>
The title is a take-off on a question raised by Scholastics of the
Middle ages , &ldquo; How many angels can dance on the top of a pin ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#5:1>
I wrote that paper to encourage younger Asian
theologians-in-the-making to make theology lively , as dancing is lively , by
suggesting that creative theological thinking can come from even a small
place like Hong Kong , which is the size of a pin  ' s head on the map . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#6:1>
This article is a further exploration of the possibilities for
doing theology , which like a wonderful dance performance , would leave a
vivid and lasting impression on one  ' s consciousness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#7:1>
I again use Hong Kong as a locus of theological exploration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#8:1>
I shall move into the level of theological thinking by way of the
dancing scene in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#9:1>
But I find <indig> ch'i </indig> &obrack; <O> Chinese-characters </O>
, meaning breath of air &cbrack; , as a Chinese philosophical category , a
helpful frame of reference for rethinking the Spirit in the Christian sense .
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#10:1>
Dancing on the Hong Kong Scene </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#11:1>
Hong Kong is not noted for its development of dancing as an art
form .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#12:1>
But , notwithstanding its critics  '  denigration of Hong Kong as a
&ldquo; cultural desert , &rdquo; in the last decade it has sponsored annual
Arts Festivals and Asian Arts Festivals which bring outstanding musicians and
performing groups from many parts of the world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#13:1>
In the dancing field , the world  ' s top ballet companies , including
Sadler  ' s Wells Ballet , the Royal Danish Ballet , the Bolshoi Ballet Company
, etc . , have graced the stages of performing theatres in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#14:1>
Practically all of the countries in Asia have sent dancing groups to
perform during the Asian Arts Festivals and <-> onother </-> <+> on other
</+> occasions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#15:1>
This year there is a Chinese Minority Groups Dance Festival ,
featuring some eight dancing troupes from China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#16:1>
So Hong Kong is a place where one has the opportunity to see dance
performances of many kinds &dash; from Europe and North America , from Asia
and China  ' s various regions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#17:1>
But has Hong Kong itself produced anything notable in the art of
dancing ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#18:1>
The answer , alas , is that Hong Kong has nothing specially its own
in this field .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#19:1>
One has to look very hard to find anything worthy about dancing on
the Hong Kong scene .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#20:1>
There is , as yet , no world class dance emerging from the indigenous
Hong Kong culture . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#21:1>
<it> Lion Dance and Dragon Dance </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#22:1>
Let me begin with a type of &ldquo; dancing &rdquo; which has
deep roots in the folk culture of the Hong Kong Chinese people though it is
not of a high art form .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#23:1>
I refer to the lion dance and the dragon dance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#24:1>
They are centuries old Chinese customs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#25:1>
They have survived to this day in Hong Kong  ' s Chinese community .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#26:1>
The two are not identical , but one or the other often appears at
a New Year &obrack; lunar calendar &cbrack; celebration or some other special
occasion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#27:1>
The lion dance uses a &ldquo; lion &rdquo; &obrack; <it> papier
mach&eacute; </it> head on a large wooden frame and a body made of a long
piece of cloth &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#28:1>
Two persons are needed to perform the dance , one at the head and one
at the tail .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#29:1>
The one carrying the head up and down must be a strong man , moving
the head with his arms and turning it in various directions , whilst doing
fancy foot-work .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#30:1>
The one at the tail holds the cloth that is the &ldquo; body &rdquo;
and takes agile foot-steps .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#31:1>
The lion dances to the beat of a drum or a gong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#32:1>
The lion can do tricks , e.g . teasing the fire-crackers and
jumping or climbing up a tree to pick a bundle of green vegetables hanging
from a high place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#33:1>
What does the lion dance signify ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#34:1>
It is supposed to assure good fortune for the community .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#35:1>
The lion , being a strong animal , is a symbol of power &dash; power
to defeat or dispel evil forces and power to bring good fortune .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#36:1>
The &ldquo; vitality &rdquo; of the lion is acknowledged right at the
start of the dance by the &rdquo; dotting of the lion  ' s eyes &rdquo; with
ink .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#37:1>
This is done by an important personage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#38:1>
Sometimes two lions dance , one male and one female .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#39:1>
It is like a <it> pas des deux </it> , but of course it is not
refined dancing as in ballet . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#40:1>
The dragon dance is more elaborate , because the dragon is more
highly decorated and much longer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#41:1>
The dragon dance requires more people to hold up the head , the body
and the tail .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#42:1>
If it is performed at a New Year function , the function must be a
big event .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#43:1>
The dragon dance may also be a part of a celebration program on other
occasions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#44:1>
Whatever the occasion is , it must be important . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#45:1>
The lion dance or the dragon dance is usually performed
out-of-doors , in a public square or park .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#46:1>
A large crowd gathers to watch the dance as a part of a community
celebration . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#47:1>
<it> <indig> Ch'an </indig> Dance </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#48:1>
From the lion dance and the dragon dance , which are extroverted
, noisy and fast-moving , I turn to a <it> <indig> ch'an </indig> </it>
&obrack; <it> zen </it> &cbrack; dance performance , which is introverted ,
quiet and slow-moving .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#49:1>
<indig> <it> <mention> <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> </mention>
</it> </indig> in Chinese &obrack; or <it> <mention> zen </mention> </it> in
Japanese &cbrack; is the word for meditation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#50:1>
The <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> Buddhist Sect , emphasizing
meditation , takes its name from the word .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#51:1>
Actually there is no species of dancing called &ldquo; <indig> <it>
ch'an </it> </indig> dance &rdquo; as such &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#52:1>
it was by coincidence that I saw a performance which was advertised
as &ldquo; <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> dance . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#53:1>
It was a performance choreographed by a Korean woman residing in
Hong Kong , Madam Lee , who is convinced that meditation according to the
<indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> Sect is a good tonic for the busy and
restless life of a modern city like Hong Kong &obrack; and Seoul &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#54:1>
A dancer and choreographer trained in modern dancing , Madam Lee
developed her <it> <indig> <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> </indig> </it>
dance by working with a small group of dancers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#55:1>
Hers is a small company performing only occasionally .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#56:1>
Out of curiosity I went to see one of its performances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#57:1>
I have not kept a program of the dance performance , and I cannot
recall the details .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#58:1>
But I did have an over-all impression of what the dance endeavored to
communicate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#59:1>
To put it in another way , the dance has transmitted to me a sense of
<indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> or <it> zen </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#60:1>
The performance that evening was on the whole slow-moving &semi;
too much so , I am afraid , for fast-paced Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#61:1>
Perhaps the slow movement was meant to be a contrast to the frenzied
Hong Kong tempo .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#62:1>
If so , the contrast could have been more effective by moving from a
fast tempo at the start to a slower-paced performance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#63:1>
At any rate , sitting in the audience I was gradually drawn into
a sense of wholeness , breaking up the usual box-like image of the stage ,
breaking down the barrier between the audience as on-lookers and the
performers as far away &ldquo; objects , &rdquo; and breaking through into an
inner consciousness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#64:1>
The consciousness was inner holistic space , which was not just a
void but was illuminated by insights . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#65:1>
The <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> dance may have been
slow-paced , yet it was movement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#66:1>
One number reminded me of <indig> <it> t'ai-chi-ch'iian </it>
</indig> movements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#67:1>
Those who are adept at <indig> <it> t'ai-chi-chiian </it> </indig>
can practice meditation &obrack; <indig> <it> <indig> <it> ch'an </it>
</indig> </it> </indig> &cbrack; in motion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#68:1>
By the same token , the <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> dance is a
form of meditation in motion or slow movement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#69:1>
How ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#70:1>
As I understand it , in this kind of <indig> <it> ch'an </it>
</indig> one meditates &ldquo; mind &rdquo; itself is &ldquo; mind-less
&rdquo; &obrack; i.e. emptied of any fixated idea &cbrack; , but moves along
with action , which is flowing and rhythmic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#71:1>
Accordingly , consciousness of the mind flows rhythmically , with the
<indig> <it> tao </it> </indig> disclosing itself along the way . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#72:1>
I may have read more into the <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig>
dance than what was warranted , but for a few fleeting moments a sense of
<indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> meditation was mediated to me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#73:1>
The <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig> dance is by no means in
the main-stream of the Hong Kong dancing scene .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#74:1>
In fact , very few people know how to appreciate it .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#75:1>
The performance that I saw was not particularly impressive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#76:1>
Yet it is noted here for a special reason .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#77:1>
<indig> <it> Ch'an </it> </indig> meditation does seem to have
something to offer in a crowded and frantic place like Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#78:1>
If a form of dancing can capture <indig> <it> ch'an </it> </indig>
spirituality , credit is due to it . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#79:1>
<it> A City Contemporary Dance Company Production </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#80:1>
The City Contemporary Dance Company , formed in 1979 , is Hong
Kong  ' s first professional contemporary dance company .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#81:1>
Its choreographer-dancers , having received training in ballet and
modern dance of the Western tradition , now go back to classical Chinese
literary and artistic contemporary age .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#82:1>
The company  ' s productions are gaining recognition among the younger
generations in Hong Kong and the troupes have travelled to neighboring Asian
cities and elsewhere to perform . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#83:1>
I refer here to a production entitled &ldquo; South Wind .
&rdquo; The entire program is based on selections from the ancient classic ,
<indig> <it> Shih Ching </it> </indig> &obrack; the Book of Poems &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#84:1>
As is often the case with the company  ' s productions , this one seeks
to re-interpret , by the dance , the classical texts in contemporary idiom .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#85:1>
The <indig> <it> Shih Ching </it> </indig> , dating back to
pre-Ch'in periods &obrack; 12th-6th centuries B.C . &cbrack; , contains 305
poems &obrack; reportedly selected by Confucius , out of several thousand
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#86:1>
The poems are grouped under the sections , &ldquo; <indig> Feng
</indig> &ldquo; &obrack; Wind &cbrack; , &ldquo; <indig> Ya </indig> &ldquo;
&obrack; Grace &cbrack; , and &ldquo; <indig> Hsiung </indig> &ldquo;
&obrack; Ode &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#87:1>
&ldquo; Wind &rdquo; includes ethos , life-style , prevailing customs
, <it> <foreign> Zeitgeist </foreign> </it> &obrack; the spirit of the times
&cbrack; , and &obrack; by a play on the sound &ldquo; <indig> feng </indig>
&ldquo; &cbrack; satire &obrack; &ldquo; <indig> feng-ch'i </indig> &ldquo;
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#88:1>
So poems under the section of &ldquo; Wind &rdquo; grew out of the
life and times of the people from various regions of ancient China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#89:1>
The poems are expressive and spontaneous , sometimes exuberant and
sometimes sorrowful , and at times with a touch a satire or humor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#90:1>
Under the section of &ldquo; Grace &rdquo; , are collected poems
written by the gentry for court ceremonies and feasts .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#91:1>
&ldquo; Ode &rdquo; is the collection of songs which were sung during
royal ceremonies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#92:1>
We can see that the <indig> <it> Shih Ching </it> </indig> is a
remarkable book .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#93:1>
Confucius , whether or not he was the actual editor , reportedly
valued it highly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#94:1>
<indig> <it> Shih Ching </it> </indig> is one of the &ldquo; Five
Classics . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#95:1>
The &ldquo; South Wind &rdquo; dance production has adopted 16
numbers from the &ldquo; Wind &rdquo; section , one each from &ldquo; Grace
&rdquo; and &ldquo; Ode &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#96:1>
The 16 &ldquo; Wind &rdquo; numbers range widely in theme and style .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#97:1>
They include harvest in the plantation , a man longing for a woman ,
the sadness of an abandoned woman , a wedding , twilight , the panic of a
woman running away with her lover , the mother-child relationship .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#98:1>
The original poems are all short and focused , and the dances also
speak to a single theme pointedly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#99:1>
Let me refer to three numbers to illustrate how the
choreographers and dancers seek to translate ancient texts into contemporary
idiom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#100:1>
&ldquo; Wind from the South &rdquo; has plants growing under the
gentle breeze to signify the growing up of children under their mother  ' s
care , but the mother becomes tired &obrack; suggested by the wilting of tree
leaves &cbrack; , and the children regret their failure to return their
filial care to her &obrack; as shown by the unruliness of the young plants
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#101:1>
This kind of poignancy in the mother-child relationship is not
uncommon in modern urban Hong Kong where mother love , given to the point of
self-sacrifice , is as valid as anywhere else , and where traditional filial
piety is still found though at times neglected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#102:1>
Poignancy comes when the children realize their failure to live up
to their expected duty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#103:1>
&ldquo; Moon Rising &rdquo; depicts a man yearning for his
dream-lover , to no avail .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#104:1>
The dream-girl is compared to the shining moon , and the man looking
at it has his heart torn by emotions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#105:1>
The dancing against the background of a moon effectively portrays
the conflict of emotions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#106:1>
Many a poem in the <indig> <it> Shih Ching </it> </indig> gives
dancing a special place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#107:1>
One of the poems , &ldquo; Heavenly Dance , &rdquo; celebrates the
art of dancing . <O> poem </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#108:1>
The dancers in this number dance with clean and vivacious steps
, making their own rhythms with bright clapping sounds &obrack; by slapping
their belts ? &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#109:1>
It gives the feeling that dancing is pure joy and wholesome fun .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-001#110:1>
Only one number is selected from the &ldquo; Grace &rdquo;
section .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#111:1>
It is the &ldquo; Song of the Gentry &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#112:1>
The dance is a decorative , extravagant and fast-flowing piece of
work .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#113:1>
The backdrop and sidedrops &obrack; made up of vertical panels of
cloth in a gradation of light colors from cream to yellow to gold to green
&cbrack; and the costumes &obrack; silvery gray silk with faint , simple
designs for both sexes &cbrack; suggest a modern setting which has good taste
, such as one would find amongst the younger affluent professionals in a
place like Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#114:1>
The dance movements are lively all right and rather expressive too
&dash; lively over what and expressive of what ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#115:1>
That is not clear .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#116:1>
The program notes say that the choreographer tries to show
&ldquo;<quote> the emptiness of bourgeoisie festivities on a bounded
stage</quote> . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#117:1>
That dance made me think of a &ldquo; yuppies &rdquo; party &dash;
smart people enjoying the pleasures of a consumer society but devoid of
meaning in their conversations and lives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#118:1>
Watching this number , I did enjoy it and found it engaging , but I
could not see the point &dash;

<ICE-HK:W2A-001#119:1>
perhaps the point of the dance is that there is not much meaning to
the kind of boxed-in existence &obrack; suggested by the bounded stage set by
the cloth backdrops and sidedrops &cbrack; of the modern &ldquo; gentry
&rdquo; . </p> </I>
