<h> <bold> Homing in on housing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#2:1>
Providing affordable housing for the general population is an
issue that has dogged Hong Kong for as long as anyone can remember .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#3:1>
The plethora of bodies carrying the housing tag testifies to past
efforts to tackle the problem from different angles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#4:1>
First , there is the Housing Authority .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#5:1>
It is tasked with building and managing public housing , both for sale
and rent , for low-income earners .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#6:1>
Responsible to the Government , it is run by a board of more than two
dozen members from different walks of life .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#7:1>
Its executive arm , the Housing Department , is a monolithic
bureaucracy of 12,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#8:1>
The Housing Society is a much smaller organisation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#9:1>
Nominally a non-governmental body , it actually takes the cue from
the Government to provide affordable housing for the so-called sandwich class .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#10:1>
Besides , the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation , which are partially and wholly owned by the Government
respectively , both have private housing development rights over their
stations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#11:1>
Directly or indirectly , these bodies are answerable to the
Housing Bureau , which was set up in the mid-1990s in response to public
demands to bring skyrocketing housing prices down , but has since gained
notoriety for its failure to engineer a soft landing for the housing market .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#12:1>
With so many housing bodies , each with their own self interests
, no wonder the Chief Secretary , rather than the Housing Secretary , has to
be the Government  ' s most authoritative spokesman on housing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#13:1>
Even without the forthcoming introduction of a ministerial system
and the related re-arrangement of the policy bureaus , the duplicating roles
of the existing housing organs need to be streamlined .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#14:1>
However , what really should have happened first is a review of Hong
Kong  ' s housing policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#15:1>
The housing bodies were set up to achieve specific missions under
the existing housing policy , in which public housing featured prominently .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#16:1>
But times have changed and public housing has clearly out-lived
its purpose .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#17:1>
The current structural revamp , whose details are still under wraps ,
should not preclude an overhaul of the way in which the community  ' s housing
aspirations are met . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#18:1>
Any strategic change must involve trimming the Government  ' s
direct involvement in building and managing public housing .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#19:1>
If that should mean disbanding the Housing Authority and Housing
Society , so be it . </p>

<h> <bold> Diplomatic decency </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#21:2>
In the post-September 11 climate of fear and insecurity , Europe
is blazing a path of rapprochement with alleged rogue states that the United
States would do well to emulate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#22:2>
Rather than use the Bush administration  ' s worn-out repertoire of
threats and warnings , the European Union is treating Iran with respect .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#23:2>
There is talk of trade and diplomatic relations instead of veiled
references to an Afghanistan-style bombing apocalypse . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#24:2>
The process was kick-started yesterday by EU Commissioner for
External Affairs Chris Patten who held talks in Brussels with Iran  ' s Deputy
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#25:2>
Ahead lies the chance of ties , which Mr Patten believes is the best
way to foster political change in Iran . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#26:2>
It is not an approach favoured by the United States and its close
ally in the Middle East , Israel . US President George W . Bush in January
named Iran , Iraq and North Korea as an &ldquo; axis of evil nations &rdquo;
developing nuclear and chemical weapons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#27:2>
Iran and Iraq support the idea of a Palestinian state and Israel
accuses Teheran of supplying weapons to anti-Israeli militants .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#28:2>
Both also represent &ldquo; unfinished business &rdquo; for
Washington - the inherent desire to win back lost pride for the toppling of
the US-backed Shah of Iran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the failure
in the 1991 Gulf War to unseat President Saddam Hussein . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#29:2>
Few nations support the US approach , which at the weekend
extended to Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggesting American operatives
working within Iraq to arrest or even kill Saddam .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#30:2>
Canada on Monday said the United Nations was the appropriate forum to
decide on action against Iraq , while Mr Bush last month met opposition from
European leaders during a four-nation visit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#31:2>
Washington  ' s words of war may aim to engender American
patriotism , but for the rest of the world they instil insecurity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#32:2>
A more intelligent approach is the European example - treating
nations with respect and as equals , no matter what their political stripes .

<h> <bold> Flaws in the mix </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#34:3>
In Hong Kong , as in most societies , people are often judged by
where they live .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#35:3>
Although the stigma of living in public housing is not strong here
because half of the local population reside in subsidised homes , owning an
upmarket flat in a nice neighbourhood is still most people  ' s cherished dream .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#36:3>
Planners always try to ensure some areas are &ldquo; reserved
&rdquo; for the rich by manipulating plot ratios and the siting of public
amenities so only plush big flats will be built there and only the well-off
can afford them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#37:3>
The most they would do to prevent class differences from being
manifested too acutely is to site mass private housing estates next to public
housing estates in the new towns .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#38:3>
But they would not dream of selling flats inside a private housing
estate at differential rates to buyers based on their varying income levels .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#39:3>
What is wrong with the mixed development policy is that it will
do just that .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#40:3>
When the North Point Estate site is put on sale , the developer who
buys it will be required to hand over a specified proportion of flats within
the development for sale under the Home Ownership Scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#41:3>
After vociferous protests from developers , the only concession
the Housing Authority has made is that the flats ear-marked for subsidised
sale will be in designated blocks .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#42:3>
This is contrary to the original policy , as stated in the Long Term
Housing Strategy published in 1998 , that &ldquo; the flats will be selected
at random throughout the development" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#43:3>
In a submission to the Government in 1997 , the authority saw
mixed development as a means &ldquo; to remove the possible social labelling
which public housing projects carry , and therefore help to foster social
harmony" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#44:3>
But has housing ever caused social disharmony in Hong Kong ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#45:3>
Not really .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#46:3>
Poor relations between residents of public and private housing have
never been an issue . Rather , homeowners ' simmering discontent over the
falling values of their properties is threatening to explode . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#47:3>
The deeper question about mixed development is whether we want to
foster housing dependency and to change deep-rooted values of regarding one  ' s
home as a reflection of one  ' s station in life . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#48:4>
<h> <bold> A logical approach </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#49:4>
There is no guarantee that the Israeli decision to move into
Palestinian towns will end Palestinian suicide bomb attacks .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#50:4>
What is more guaranteed is that the presence of the Israeli military
will further infuriate the Palestinians . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#51:4>
Military force , the rounding up of suspected militants , and the
humiliation of the Palestinian leadership has been tried before , but the
suicide attacks still keep coming . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#52:4>
After Tuesday  ' s suicide bomb attack which killed 19 Israelis in
Jerusalem , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had to respond in some way .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#53:4>
He has responded in a way that most Israelis would like him to .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#54:4>
But the recent occupation of Palestinian towns under Operation
Defensive Shield , does not appear to have enhanced Israel  ' s security , as
the recent attack has shown .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#55:4>
The conflict of the past few decades has produced a generation of
Palestinians who are willing to kill themselves for their cause .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#56:4>
The experience of the past shows that fresh military action will only
strengthen their resolve . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#57:4>
Unfortunately , while past experience has taught us what is not
likely to work , no one is quite sure what the best approach is to restore
peace between Israelis and Palestinians .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#58:4>
The international community is clear about what it would like to see:
an Israeli state and a Palestinian state side by side , both with secure ,
recognised boundaries .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#59:4>
The problem is that every effort so far to reach this goal has fallen
by the wayside .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#60:4>
Apportioning blame to one side or the other for this state of affairs
does not help .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#61:4>
If anything , the leadership of both the Israelis and the
Palestinians have been culpable for this situation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#62:4>
Security for Israel , and dignity for the Palestinians .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#63:4>
How is this to be achieved ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#64:4>
Even if no one is quite clear about how to proceed , it is obvious
that as a first step the violence must end , and talks must begin .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#65:4>
The United States has a crucial role to play in getting talks resumed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#66:4>
The speech that US President George W . Bush is to deliver outlining
his plans to restore peace will be an important step in this direction .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#67:4>
It is hoped that extreme elements on both the Israeli and the
Palestinian side will restrain themselves enough to give peace a chance .

<h> <bold> Housing challenge </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#69:5>
The long-awaited shake-up of the Government  ' s housing machinery
brings much needed simplicity to what was a confusing and unwieldy collection
of different bodies with often overlapping mandates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#70:5>
The most eye-catching changes are the merger of the Housing
Bureau and the Housing Department into a single organisation and the gradual
change in the role of the Housing Authority from an executive to an advisory
body .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#71:5>
Equally significant for the property market has been the decision to
tighten the granting of land to the MTRC , the KCRC and the Urban Renewal
Authority .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#72:5>
The Housing Society , too , will see a change in its role from a
builder of public rental or subsidised home ownership flats to an agent for
urban renewal in partnership with the Urban Renewal Authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#73:5>
These changes make administrative sense , creating clear lines of
command as well as clarifying the roles that the different organisations
dealing with housing will play .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#74:5>
They will centralise power , but this is essential if we are to get
more coherent policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#75:5>
But the real test of how effective these changes will be is the
extent to which they help to achieve the aims of assuring quality housing in
a way that is cost effective . The Government  ' s declared strategy is to rely
on the private sector to the maximum extent possible , and using public
resources only for those who genuinely cannot afford housing at market rates .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#76:5>
Sticking to this will require political courage .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#77:5>
When housing prices start to rise again , as they almost inevitably
will , there will be an increasing clamour for the Government to actively
re-enter the housing market to provide low-cost housing .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#78:5>
Past experience has shown that this a slippery slope that will lead
to ever increasing involvement in the housing market .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#79:5>
Mr Tung  ' s new administration will need to show resolve to avoid the
temptation to re-enter a sector that it is only slowly extricating itself
from . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#80:5>
At the same time , the Government needs to focus attention on its
long-term land supply policy to avoid the boom and bust cycle that Hong Kong
is still recovering from .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#81:5>
An efficient and transparent land supply policy has to be part and
parcel of a programme to deliver cost efficient public housing in a way that
complements the market , rather than manipulating or controlling it . </p>

Too often , the answers to conflicts lie in the not-so-distant past
, yet are ignored in favour of more fashionable ideas of resolution . </p>

The United States ' war on terrorism has been cited once more as

At least 4,700 people have died during the six-year conflict , 2,500
of them since November , when peace talks collapsed , a state of emergency

Nepalis earn an average of 60 US cents a day , almost half of
what the World Bank considers the poverty line .

elsewhere . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#95:6>
The Government has portrayed the insurgency as part of the war
against terrorism , but it is a conflict that goes beyond resolution through
military action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-008#96:6>
A more effective solution can be found in the US-backed plans
which rebuilt Japan and Europe after World War II .

<ICE-HK:W2E-008#97:6>
Using development aid rather than military muscle , the wrongs which
have been created can be eradicated . </p>

It will be an expensive and lengthy process , but it is the only
