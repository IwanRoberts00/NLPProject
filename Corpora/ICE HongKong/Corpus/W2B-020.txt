Abuse of the elderly is nothing new , but the government has only just
recognised it . <bold> Lim Li Min </bold> talks to victims and reformers who
want the violence stopped . </h> <O> A photo </O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#3:1>
Even in her own home , Mrs Tsang , 74 , doesn't feel safe .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#4:1>
The retired cleaner knows that if her drug-dazed daughter is in an
ugly mood tonight , she might be beaten . Possibly very badly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#5:1>
Three years ago , the young woman attacked her mother with a heavy
wooden chair .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#6:1>
Tsang pleaded , but her daughter was feeling particularly venomous
that night .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#7:1>
She was beaten again and again , and then a bone in her left arm
cracked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#8:1>
Today , after enduring a lifetime of abuse from her husband - who
also used to hit her - and now form her daughter , Tsang is on medication for
depression .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#9:1>
Through bitter tears , she sighs and says: &ldquo; I must have done
something really bad in my former life to deserve such as daughter . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#10:1>
Decades of physical and emotional abuse have taken their toll .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#11:1>
Tsang  ' s body is covered in bruises , she is partially blind and her
arm has not quite set properly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#12:1>
She now ties her cash in a stocking around her waist to stop her
daughter from stealing it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#13:1>
&ldquo; I live in fear every day . I  ' m afraid of my own daughter
, &rdquo; Tsang sobs , burying her silvery head in vein-etched hands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#14:1>
Tragically , stories such as Tsang  ' s are common in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#15:1>
Although abuse of elderly is an ancient pandemic , the SAR has been
slow to recognise it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#16:1>
Only in 1999 did the social services acknowledge there was indeed a
problem , but they grossly underestimated the numbers of elderly victims .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#17:1>
&ldquo; The-then social welfare director said there were 97 cases in
that year , &rdquo; says Chung Kim-wah , assistant professor at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University  ' s Department of Applied Social Sciences , shaking his
head in disbelief .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#18:1>
&ldquo; We now know that this was not the case .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#19:1>
We come across cases of elderly abuse every day . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#20:1>
Last year , the official figure was increased to 243 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#21:1>
Exactly how many there really are , nobody knows .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#22:1>
But Chung insists that what they are seeing is only a fraction of the
actual cases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#23:1>
He says that in a survey he conducted with the Chinese University
of Hong Kong in 1999 , 11 percent of respondents aged 60-plus reported having
encountered some form of maltreatment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#24:1>
Most vulnerable , the survey found , are the sick , the uneducated ,
the poor and the women . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#25:1>
But Professor Iris Chi , director of the Centre on Ageing at Hong
Kong University is adamant that it cuts across all classes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#26:1>
&ldquo; Because abuse is a power thing , it does tend to be the
strong taking advantage of the weak .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#27:1>
But I  ' ve also discovered that abuse if really no respected of social
standing , &rdquo; she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#28:1>
Haven of Hope Christian Service is both a care and attention
centre and a nursing home for the elderly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#29:1>
Old folk gather there to socialise , receive medical treatment or
bend a friendly ear .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#30:1>
In the room where some elderly people are sitting watching TV , or
just napping , there is a goldfish tank , an exercise machine and comfortable
chairs . </p> <O> 2 photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#31:1>
Yet despite the cheery setting and placid-faced regulars , some
of the clients of social worker Marion Hung have stories of debilitating
abuse to tell . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#32:1>
Since its hotline was set up in May , Haven has received around
40 calls , 15 per cent of them telling harrowing tales of emotional and
physical abuse , meted out by relatives and care-givers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#33:1>
&ldquo; Elderly abuse is a serious problem in Hong Kong ,
although many would rather not talk about it , &rdquo; Hung says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#34:1>
Ironically , it is the romanticised Chinese ideal of filial piety
that is making elderly abuse so hard to unearth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#35:1>
Chung is adamant in his condemnation of the government  ' s complacency .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#36:1>
&ldquo; They always thought that Hong Kong society was so filial
, &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#37:1>
&ldquo; So we were totally unprepared when this problem surfaced .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#38:1>
And since we  ' ve not evolved social measures to cope with elderly
abuse , we can expect family conflict and problems for may years to come .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#39:1>
As it happens , Hong Kong  ' s ageing population is a ticking bomb .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#40:1>
In 1996 , 14 per cent of the population was aged above 60 , a figure
estimated to grow to 19 per cent by 2016 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#41:1>
Given the lack of procedural guidelines for dealing with elderly
abuse , Chung is not at all optimistic about the situation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#42:1>
&ldquo; Hong Kong is totally unprepared for its greying citizens
, &rdquo; he warns . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#43:1>
The city  ' s physical infrastructure is also exacerbating the
problem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#44:1>
Hong Kong just doesn't have enough space for its hemmed-in people to
co-habit successfully .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#45:1>
And when overcrowding happens in a family unit , it  ' s often the
weakest and frailest who get pushed out first .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#46:1>
Chung cites cases of old men not allowed back home until dinner time;
grannies who have to spend entire days on city park benches . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#47:1>
Grey-haired Mrs Kwok , 76 , goes to the Kwai Chung Elderly
Service Centre three times a week to get away from it all .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#48:1>
This simply-furnished , two-roomed centre may not be much to look at
, but it at least provides a respite from her family  ' s mean-spirited
treatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#49:1>
Her room at home is one half of a stuffy , windowless hovel
shared with her grandchildren , but it  ' s not her impoverished circumstances
that upset her .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#50:1>
What is so hurtful is her daughter-in-law  ' s deliberate , systematic
cruelty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#51:1>
Tears roll down her sunken cheeks as she recounts the sad events
of her life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#52:1>
&ldquo; I cried in front of my son .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#53:1>
He knows what his wife does .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#54:1>
But even he hits me , &rdquo; she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#55:1>
Kwok is not allowed to eat with the rest of the family . She
cooks barely-adequate meals of salt fish in her own room .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#56:1>
She takes only cold showers , even in winter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#57:1>
When she last fell and was unable to get up , she went hungry; nobody
brought her any food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#58:1>
Nobody even acknowledges her presence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#59:1>
&ldquo; I raised my kids and my grandchildren .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#60:1>
I  ' m really heartbroken that they  ' re doing this to me , &rdquo; she
says weeping . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#61:1>
Abuse has many guises: psychological , physical , neglect ,
financial , sexual - each just as emotionally devastating as the other .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#62:1>
In the SAR , as in many parts of the world , emotional abuse is the
most prevalent form .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#63:1>
In the Polytechnic survey , it constituted 18 per cent of
maltreatment cases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#64:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s terrible when that happens because the abuser is
often someone who  ' s close to &obrack;  the victim &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#65:1>
They  ' re afraid to talk about it , they don't know who to turn to ,
&rdquo; Chi says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#66:1>
It  ' s tough enough just being old , so it  ' s not wonder that such
maltreatment is often the last blow that pushes the elderly over the edge .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#67:1>
And sometimes , the effects of abuse are , quite literally , deadly
in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#68:1>
The SAR has the second highest rate of elderly suicide in Asia ,
after Singapore . Although the aged only form 12 per cent of the population ,
Chi says , their suicide rates stand disproportionately high at 30 per cent .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#69:1>
&ldquo; When you are old , you feel useless; you  ' re not
respected , you have no worth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#70:1>
Because you have no financial means you  ' re not an attractive
demographics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#71:1>
This is a problem that  ' s especially pertinent to Hong Kong , &rdquo;
Chung says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#72:1>
Try telling that to tiny Mrs To , 89 , who has never attended
school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#73:1>
Aside from her string of ailments - rheumatism , diabetes , gastritis
, and various aches and pains - she has spent her whole life scraping by on
&dollar;20 a day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#74:1>
By day , she picks up scraps of cardboard from the street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#75:1>
At night , the frail grandmother sleeps on a tiny kitchen balcony .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#76:1>
But if her life is indeed a living hell , it  ' s because of her
abusive daughter-in-law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#77:1>
&ldquo; She frequently shouts:  ' Why aren't you dead yet ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#78:1>
Go and die ' , &rdquo; she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#79:1>
" I have no friends or relatives to turn to for help .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#80:1>
I cry and cry until I can't see anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#81:1>
I feel so very , very helpless . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#82:1>
If To is not to become yet another statistic that slips through
the net , then decisive measures need to be taken .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#83:1>
The process of drafting definitions and guidelines on elderly abuse
started by Social Welfare only this May may be too little , too late .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#84:1>
Experts are calling for an urgent raft of measures .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#85:1>
Chung , for one , has one long wish list: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#86:1>
&ldquo; More social system checks and balances; a proper
retirement protection scheme; greater numbers of independent elderly flats;
acknowledging the role of care-givers; more general public awareness-raising
campaigns . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#87:1>
If and when this finally happens , women such as Tsang may one
day go home without cowering in fear . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#88:1>
<bold> For social welfare workers: </bold> Procedural guidelines
on identifying abuse , the mandatoiry reporting of abuse , and a standardised
reporting method . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#89:1>
<bold> For the public: </bold> A concrete definition that spells
out the different forms of abuse , and what to do if you come across it .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#90:1>
<bold> Legislation: </bold> Because no specific laws exist ,
Chung Kim-wah of Polytechnic University would like to see an anti-elderly
abuse act , similar to that in the United States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#91:1>
<bold> Financial assistance: </bold> The Mandatory Provident Fund
, introduced only last year , only covers the employed elderly . Chung would
like to see a comprehensive retirement protection scheme , which safeguards
both working and non-working elderly , including homemarkers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#92:1>
<bold> Housing: </bold> Shelter housing is currently the main
form of elderly housing for lower income groups . But since facilities are
shared , and the average waiting time is two to three years , Chung would
like to see more independent units for old folks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#93:1>
<bold> Care-givers: </bold> Since care-giving is often a
stressful , thankless job , a better support network , in the form of
counselling , training and tax exemptions for family members looking after
elderly relatives , are needed . Currently , only Caritas and Social Welfare
Department offer career support services in Hong Kong . </p>

<bold> Cool , bright sparks </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#95:2>
If necessity is the mother of invention , then Hong Kong needs more
people like Emmy Lok , Karen Chan and Chu Ka-wai , who cleaned the board at a
competition to come up with the most wanted inventions in the 21st century .
<bold> Karvin Au-yeung </bold> reports </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#96:2>
Heavy school bags floating on thin air .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#97:2>
&ldquo; Invisible walking sticks &rdquo; for the blind fused with
<it> Star Wars </it> technology . And &ldquo; green &rdquo; trash bins that
literally eat your rubbish . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#98:2>
Science fiction ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#99:2>
Think again .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#100:2>
These are the latest brain-tingling ideas from Hong Kong  ' s next
generation of innovators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#101:2>
Among the young inventors is 17-year old Emmy Lok King-yu , who
recently won a &dollar;10,500 prize in the government sponsored Most Wanted
Inventions in the 21st Century competition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#102:2>
Lok came up with the futuristic trash bin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#103:2>
&ldquo; I never thought I would win anything in the competition ,
&rdquo; she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#104:2>
&ldquo; I was just looking to improve existing trash bins .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#105:2>
I don't really see myself as an inventor . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#106:2>
Her concept was simple , yet brilliant .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#107:2>
&ldquo; I wanted to find a way to get rid of the garbage , &rdquo;
Lok says , &ldquo; so I designed a bin that absorbs and degrades toxic
materials before rubbish is processed . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#108:2>
Lok  ' s idea is for the trash to be broken down into smaller
waste components before it  ' s picked up by garbage trucks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#109:2>
Inside the design student;s &ldquo; green &rdquo; bin would be a
chemical cocktail that will consume the toxic materials . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#110:2>
&ldquo; I know how it will work , &rdquo; she says , &ldquo; but
I don't know yet how to put it all together .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#111:2>
I need to work with someone who has a background in chemistry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#112:2>
But it will work . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#113:2>
The judges thought so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#114:2>
The panel of experts from academia and government-backed
organisations also singled out Karen Chan Ka-wing  ' s &ldquo; floating &rdquo;
schoolbag blueprint . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#115:2>
&ldquo; I wear a heavy bag every day , &rdquo; says the
15-year-old .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#116:2>
&ldquo; It takes me 40 minutes to get to school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#117:2>
The bag is so heavy it forced me to think about how I could make it
lighter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#118:2>
Then , out of the blue , it came to me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#119:2>
It was like a light bulb flashed on inside my head . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#120:2>
Chan decided to turn her schoolbag into a bowl-shaped helium
balloon with a couple of designer twists .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#121:2>
Basically the bag would be made up of helium pockets welded into a
half sphere .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#122:2>
Inside would be room for books and other school equipment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#123:2>
Instead of wearing it , the bag would float aloft like a balloon .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#124:2>
&ldquo; All you would need is a handle to make sure your balloon
bag didn't float away , &rdquo; she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#125:2>
Chan has even worked out the cost of here invention .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#126:2>
&ldquo; It could be as cheap as &dollar;100 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#127:2>
It has to be reasonably cheap , because my classmates wouldn't be
willing to buy a really expensive bag . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#128:2>
The bottom line is just as important to Chan as the product
itself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#129:2>
But then , she admits that being an &ldquo; inventor &rdquo; is out
of step with her character .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#130:2>
Chan loves playing the piano and enjoys being a member of the Good
Hope school swimming team . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#131:2>
&ldquo; I just thought the helium bag was a cool idea , &rdquo;
she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#132:2>
&ldquo; Cool &rdquo; could describe Chu Ka-wai , who finds it
easy to come up with futuristic gizmos .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#133:2>
The 30-year old senior engineer at Philips Electronics invented 34
gadgets during a two-week spell , including the &ldquo; invisible walking
stick &rdquo; for the blind . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#134:2>
The device is the size of a mobile phone and works by bouncing
ultrasound off objects .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#135:2>
As a blind person nears an obstacle , an alarm goes off .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#136:2>
A voice then directs him safely past the hazard . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#137:2>
Chu won the first prize of &dollar;30,000 for his &ldquo;
invisible walking stick &rdquo; and a couple of his other gadgets .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#138:2>
&ldquo; I love the  ' invisible walking stick ' because it helps people
, &rdquo; Chu says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#139:2>
&ldquo; I  ' m also thinking about a new version of it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#140:2>
My idea is for the sensor to be worn on the wrist , like a watch .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#141:2>
But that idea is still at the research stage . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#142:2>
Research is Chu  ' s buzzword .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#143:2>
He is a veteran inventor and was happy to share the secrets of his
success . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#144:2>
&ldquo; First , you must brainstorm , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#145:2>
&ldquo; Write down everything that comes into your mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#146:2>
Then narrow the ideas down and concentrate on the best ones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#147:2>
In some cases , you might have to do some research to make it all
work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#148:2>
Finally , work out if the product can be marketed and if it will be
profitable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#149:2>
If your product cannot pass those tests , dump it because no one
will ever use it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#150:2>
Chu might be on the edge of cutting-edge appliances , but he is
one of the few , according to the Hong Kong Inventors Association .

<ICE-HK:W2B-020#151:2>
Chairman Cheung Kin-fung says the association ias only 200 members
and most work on their cost-saving devices in their spare time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#152:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s tough for people to create new things , &rdquo;
says 84-year old Cheung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-020#153:2>
Hopefully , a new generation of inventors , such as schoolgirls
Emmy Lok King-yu and Karen Chan Ka-wing , will prove him wrong . </p>
