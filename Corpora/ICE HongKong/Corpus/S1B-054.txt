And now I proceed to the eleventh and the last motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#15:1:A>
Uh Mr Ron Arculli

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-054#16:1:B>
Mr President I move the motion standing in my name on the
order paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#17:1:B>
The motion seeks to repeal part of the Road Traffic Ordinance
amendment of schedule eight order nineteen ninety-five under section
thirty-four two of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#18:1:B>
The Road Traffic Ordinance amendment of schedule eight order
nineteen ninety-five published as legal notice number four five three of
nineteen ninety-five and laid on the table of the Legislative Council on the
eleventh October nineteen ninety-five increases by about nine percent the
fees charged by car testing centres for initial <,> examination of private
cars and light goods vehicle re-examination of such vehicles within fourteen
days of initial examination and issue of a duplicate copy of a certificate of
roadworthiness in respect of such vehicles <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#19:1:B>
The order also increases the fee charged by government for the
supply of each certificate of roadworthiness form to the car testing centres
by nine percent to reflect the increase in cost since its last revision in
November nineteen ninety-four

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#20:1:B>
These increases are to take effect from ninth November nineteen
ninety-five <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#21:1:B>
The car testing centres are private garages designated by the
Commissioner for Transport for the inspection of private cars and light goods
vehicles

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#22:1:B>
The fees involved were last revised in November nineteen
ninety-four

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#23:1:B>
As the examination fees charged by the Government Vehicle
Examination Centres had been revise in June nineteen ninety-five with the
similar nine percent increase <,> the car testing centres fees with a nine
percent increase will remain on par with the fees charged by a government
vehicle examination centres

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#24:1:B>
In view of this consideration the sub-committee decided to support
the increases for the car testing centres but not the increase in fees
charged by the government for the supply of each certificate of
roadworthiness form

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#25:1:B>
In accordance with the sub-committee  ' s recommendation which is
supported by the House Committee I move the motion to amend section two of
the order by repealing sub-section C which sets out the revised fees for
supply for each form of certificate of roadworthiness in respect of private
cars and light goods vehicle <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-054#26:1:A>
And I  ' ll propose the question to you and that is at section
two of the Road Traffic Ordinance amendment of schedule eight order nineteen
ninety-five published as legal notice number four five three of nineteen
ninety-five and laid on the table of the Legislative Council on eleventh
October nineteen ninety-five be amended as set out in the order paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#27:1:A>
Does any member of public officer wish to speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#28:1:A>
Secretary for Transport

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X29:1:Z>
Mr President

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X30:1:Z>
The fees for the inspection of private cars and light goods
vehicles at government vehicle examination centres were increased in June
this year

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X31:1:Z>
The Road Traffic Ordinance amendment of schedule eight order
nineteen ninety-five seeks to bring to the same level the fees for similar
<.> ex </.> inspections at car testing centres which although privately owned
are designated by government under the Road Traffic Ordinance to provide
vehicle testing facilities

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X32:1:Z>
The order also seeks to adjust the fees payable for certificate of
roadworthiness

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X33:1:Z>
It is only fair and to be expected that a vehicle owner should pay
the same fee to have his vehicle inspected either at the government VEC or a
CTC

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X34:1:Z>
In this respect I  ' m glad that the Honourable Ron Arculli has
accepted this and has not sought to amend section two sub-section B of the
order which seeks to standardise these fees

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X35:1:Z>
Section two C of the order seeks to revise the fees for
certificate of roadworthiness

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X36:1:Z>
This is the mechanism through which the administration recoups
cost in respect of providing staff to administer the CTC scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X37:1:Z>
Our team qualifies CTC vehicle testers and its responsible for
checking the facilities at and <.> mon </.> monitoring the quality of service
provided by CTCs

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X38:1:Z>
Such monitoring is necessary to ensure that the standards of
vehicle examinations are uniform

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X39:1:Z>
The fact is that vehicle owners do not pay anything extra for
roadworthiness certificates

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X40:1:Z>
It is the CTC operators who pay the administration out of the fees
they will collect

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X41:1:Z>
Indeed the schedule of charges already include administrative
costs

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X42:1:Z>
I therefore see no logic or justification whatsoever in seeking to
repeal section two C of the order

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X43:1:Z>
Mr President if the motion is adopted this will result in a
distinct element of inconsistency on the council  ' s part

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X44:1:Z>
May I <.> re </.> respectfully remind <.> hono </.> honourable
members that in adopting the nineteen ninety-four uh Public Accounts
Committee recommendations on the audit <.> re </.> report on fees for vehicle
examinations members specifically expressed the firm view that fees for
vehicle examination services should be set on a full recovery basis and that
the level of fees should be revised annually to avoid substantial adjustment
at irregular intervals

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X45:1:Z>
Mr President to support the motion now under consideration would
in effect mean that honourable members are vetoing what they themselves so
strongly advocated should be the practice that the administration should
follow in reviewing and adjusting vehicle inspection fees

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#X46:1:Z>
I therefore urge members to vote against this motion </X>

Council will now resume the debate on the motion of thanks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#65:1:A>
Financial Secretary

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-054#66:1:C>
Mr President

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#67:1:C>
In his Policy Address the Governor said that a civil service no
matter how effective its performance never expects headlines in the press to
read <,> government does a great job

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#68:1:C>
He also predicted that the response of this council to his address
to the Progress Report and to the Policy Commitments will be a blend of
fair-minded appreciation what has been achieved and demands for higher
standards <,> new policies <,> and greater accountability

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#69:1:C>
He was right in the case of a selected number of speeches that I
heard on Wednesday and Thursday last week <,> but a focus of many others
seems to fall elsewhere <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#70:1:C>
Before I respond to the many specific proposals advanced by members
in their contributions to this debate <,> I would like to take up two
important general issues <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#71:1:C>
The first concerns the assertion made specifically by several
members and implied by many others that the government does not listen hard
enough <,> to the views of this council or to the community

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#72:1:C>
Let me emphasise just how seriously the Hong Kong Government takes
your comments and criticisms <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#73:1:C>
Many of the four hundred and seventy-one outstanding Policy
Commitments from the Governor  ' s first three Policy Addresses had their
origins in suggestions some members of the Legislative Council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#74:1:C>
Many of the three hundred and forty-three new initiatives announce
by the Governor this year also have their origins and ideas and suggestions
from members of the Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#75:1:C>
The consultation on the budget which began before the summer recess
is a six-month process of listening to the views of members of this council
<,> to ensure that the budget addresses the real concerns of the community

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#76:1:C>
As members know I have recently started the second stage of this
vital exercise <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#77:1:C>
Of course the government listens <,> and the government also
responds

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#78:1:C>
This is the general point second general point I wish to make <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#79:1:C>
Over the past three years there has been a revolution in the
culture of our public service <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#80:1:C>
The principles of performance and service are now the very essence
of the relationship between the civil service and the community <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#81:1:C>
I hope members will not lose sight of this essential fact of Hong
Kong  ' s political administrative life <,> as they make their contributions to
the many important debates which lie ahead of us in this session <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#82:1:C>
The Chief Secretary will have <.> wil </.> <.> wou </.> <.> wil
</.> will have more to say on this subject <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#83:1:C>
Sufficiently for me to say briefly here that a totally transparent
<?> way </?> my colleagues have spelt out their policy commitments and
evaluate the results every year have given a whole new meaning to public
administration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#84:1:C>
In his Policy Address last month the Governor stressed that the
government and the Legislative Council must work together

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#85:1:C>
Otherwise any plans to improve our services will amount to nothing
more than good intentions

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#86:1:C>
The administration takes this policy to heart

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#87:1:C>
My colleagues and I attach great importance to the view of this
council in shaping our proposal to members

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#88:1:C>
Of course there will be differences of opinion

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#89:1:C>
Of course the government will sometimes express its views very
forcefully <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#90:1:C>
Of course there will be vigorous debates

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#91:1:C>
But our guiding principle our shared guiding principle must be the
best interest of the community we serve <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#92:1:C>
Equally the community has the right to know in full the arguments
for and against the policy proposals under debate in this council

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#93:1:C>
It falls to me to start the government  ' s response to the many
important points made by honourable members last week

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#94:1:C>
For me as Financial Secretary the single most important issue was a
real was a very real concern which members expressed over their perceptions
of the current state of Hong Kong  ' s economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#95:1:C>
I have been presented with a very substantial agenda

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#96:1:C>
Members have asked me to produce packages to stimulate the economy
<,> and to reduce inflation unemployment the income gap and taxes

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#97:1:C>
In themselves these are all laudable objectives which the
administration is fully prepared to discuss further with members <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#98:1:C>
I will address each issue individually today and in more detail
during the separate debates in this council scheduled for next week <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#99:1:C>
Let me start with the general state of Hong Kong  ' s economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#100:1:C>
I have heard members use the term <mention> recession </mention>
<,> to describe its present and projected condition

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#101:1:C>
I do not believe that recession is an appropriate way to describe
our economy <,> which is growing this year at a rate of five percent in real
terms <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#102:1:C>
A commonly accepted definition of a recession is when the actual
level of an economy  ' s GDP has fallen I repeat fallen over continuous period
of at least two consecutive quarters

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#103:1:C>
We are scarcely in such a situation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#104:1:C>
In the first quarter of nineteen ninety-five the economy grew by
nine <.> poin </.> five point nine percent <,> due to a particularly strong
rise in export levels

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#105:1:C>
As some members have pointed out it is simple arithmetic that in
forecasting a five percent growth for the year the growth rate is likely to
moderate to below five percent during the latter part of the year

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#106:1:C>
But for the year as a whole I would still expect the economy of
Hong Kong to achieve real growth of around five percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#107:1:C>
This is very much in line with a forecast trend growth rate on
which government bases its revenue and spending plans <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#108:1:C>
I acknowledge that this growth rate represents a slower pace of
economic expansion than we had forecast at the start of the year

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#109:1:C>
But I do not accept the reduction in our forecast growth rate for
the year from five point five percent to five percent justifies <?> the </?>
more lurid media  ' s reports of doom and gloom that have accompanied the
release of recent economic data

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#110:1:C>
By no stretch of imagination can Hong Kong be described as in
recession or even threatened by recession

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#111:1:C>
What we are seeing now is a moderation of the very rapid speed at
which our economy grew in the latter part of the eighties <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#112:1:C>
The present rate of five percent growth would be the envy of many
industrialised countries which understand the full meaning of the term
recession <,> because they have suffered sustained declines in GDP

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#113:1:C>
Through hard work and some good fortune Hong Kong like many of
this region  ' s economies has remained largely untouched by the latest global
recession <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#114:1:C>
While we should never be complacent about our own performance we
must accept that even for resilient entrepreneurial Hong Kong an open economy
means that we cannot escape completely from the consequences of major shifts
in marketplace in the marketplace of cyclical downturns of the global economy

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#115:1:C>
This means that from time to time the pace of growth will slow
down <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#116:1:C>
Let me emphasise that it is the pace of growth that may decline
but I do not expect that even in a global recession Hong Kong  ' s GDP will
fall in actual terms

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#117:1:C>
I base this confidence on Hong Kong  ' s record of unbroken annual
growth in GDP for the past thirty-five years

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#118:1:C>
At the moment we are in a phase of the business cycle which brings
lower growth

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#119:1:C>
We are currently experiencing a slowdown in domestic consumption
after of several years remarkable buoyancy

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#120:1:C>
A period <.> o </.> of consolidation of the stock and property
markets began somewhat earlier and has also affected local sentiment and
consumption

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#121:1:C>
And of course reduce feelgood factor

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#122:1:C>
However let us place all this in context

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#123:1:C>
We continue to perform well on the external trade front

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#124:1:C>
In the first nine months of this year domestic exports re-exports
and export of services all grew in real terms <,> with the last two in
particular registering double digits increases over the same period in
nineteen ninety-four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#125:1:C>
The growth in investment activity has also been impressive over
this period

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#126:1:C>
Investor confidence has remained solid

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#127:1:C>
Retain imports of capital goods were up by twenty-eight percent in
the major sectors for the first nine months of this year

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#128:1:C>
With significant injections of public and <.> pri </.> private
funds taking place in such infrastructural projects as the airport core
programme over the next few years and potential projects such as the railway
development strategy on the drawing-board a high-level investment looks set
to continue well into the next century

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#129:1:C>
These facts scarcely point to recession

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#130:1:C>
But I must repeat

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#131:1:C>
We are not complacent about our economic performance

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#132:1:C>
And I  ' m grateful for members  '  suggestions about ways to overcome
our current problems and improve our future performance <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#133:1:C>
But there are limits to which <.> whi </.> what can be done

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#134:1:C>
Before we embark on new policies we must be certain that proposals
of changes are necessary and not just short-term gestures that could do
lasting harm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#135:1:C>
They must be effective and not just a matter of throwing <.> payer
</.> tax payers  '  money at problems

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#136:1:C>
And they must be within the government  ' s proper responsibility
and not just an excuse for clumsy intervention in the economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#137:1:C>
I  ' ll have more to say on this and on our longer-term economic
strategy during the motion debate on the economy next week

<ICE-HK:S1B-054#138:1:C>
But in general I will ask members to bear in mind the experience
of advanced economies elsewhere that short-term measures designed to
kick-start the economy can be costly <,> are often of doubtful usefulness and
can have harmful consequences over the long term </I>
