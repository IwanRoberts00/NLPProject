<ICE-HK:W2B-028#5:1>
Recently , Black-faced Spoonbill which used to be the flagship
species in Mai Po wetland , has become a hot topic again .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#6:1>
It is now a successful example for international conservation
programmes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#7:1>
In recent international census , researchers found that the world
population of this globally threatened species is escalating steadily .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#8:1>
One of the reasons would be conservation efforts made by a number of
collaborating countries .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#9:1>
Now the Black-faced Spoonbill Research Group of the Hong Kong Bird
Watching Society is presenting the detailed and in-depth feature story of
Black-faced Spoonbill and providing you the most comprehensive information on
this spectacular series . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<bold> Discovery of Black-faced Spoonbill in HK </bold> </h> <O>
Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#11:1>
The first Black-faced Spoonbill was collected and named in 1849 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#12:1>
In the early 1900s , an ornithologist , La Touche , noted that
Black-faced Spoonbill was not uncommon in the southeastern coast of China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#13:1>
The first official local record of Black-faced Spoonbill in Hong Kong
was made by the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society on 14 November 1956 in Mai Po
Marshes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#14:1>
According to <it> The Avifauna of Hong Kong </it> , the number of
Black-faced Spoonbills in Hong Kong remained below 35 in the early 1980s;
however , it gradually increased during the 1990s , and exceeded 200 in
winter of 2001-02 . </p> <O> A picture </O> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<bold> Family and Genus </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#16:1>
Black-faced Spoonbill is a member of the family Threskiornithidae
and the order Ciconiiformes .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#17:1>
This worldwide family includes ibises and spoonbills , and
comprises 28 species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#18:1>
In the genus <it> Platalea </it> &obrack;  spoonbills &cbrack; , there are only six
species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#19:1>
African Spoonbill is restricted to Africa .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#20:1>
The beautiful pink roseate Spoonbill is distributed in the region of
North and South America .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#21:1>
In Australia , there are two species of spoonbills - Yellow-billed
Spoonbill and Royal Spoonbill . Eurasian Spoonbill and Black-faced Spoonbill
can be seen in Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#22:1>
The world population of Black-faced Spoonbill is about a thousand ,
and it is classified as &ldquo; Endangered: species by BirdLife International .

<bold> What does it look like ? </bold> </h> </O> Chinese translation
</O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#24:1>
The name of Black-faced Spoonbill actually comes from its
appearance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#25:1>
The long bill is enlarged at the tip , forming a spoon-shaped
structure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#26:1>
Its facial colour is different from Eurasian Spoonbill by having a
larger black facial skin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#27:1>
Apart from its black face , bill and long feet , its entire plumage
is white in colour except in breeding season .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#28:1>
It is also dubbed as a  ' Black-faced dancer ' in Taiwan since its
behaviour and posture while feeding , wading and flight are elegant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#30:1>
The facial skin is black .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#31:1>
Mature individuals have a yellow patch in front of the eyes which can
be seen year round . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <O> A photo </O> <h>

<bold> Bill </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#33:1>
The bill of the juvenile is pinkish and the upper surface is
smooth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#34:1>
As the bird gets older , the colour turns darker and horizontal
ridges are formed on the upper surface .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#35:1>
Males have longer bills &obrack;  19-21 cm &cbrack; than females &obrack;  16-18 cm &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#37:1>
Immature birds have black tips on their primary feathers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#38:1>
This gradually disappears until the bird reaches the age of 5 or
older . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <O> A photo </O> <h>

<bold> Size </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#42:1>
Black-faced Spoonbill is smaller than the commonly seen Great
Egret &obrack;  left &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#43:1>
Body length is around 75-80 cm .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#44:1>
In general , males are larger than females , but the difference is
not obvious in the field . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<bold> World Population and Protection Status </bold> </h> <O>
Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#46:1>
In 1989 Hong Kong ornithologists drew global attention to the
threatened status of this declining population .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#47:1>
The historical status of Black-faced Spoonbill and the reason for
their present small number is still poorly understood . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#48:1>
In the early 90s the known world population of Black-faced
Spoonbill was 294 individuals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#49:1>
The small population size , possibility of serious short-term decline
, and its geographical restriction to East Asia might have led to its
extinction .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#50:1>
Its global status was listed as &ldquo; Critically Endangered ,
&rdquo; evoking global awareness thereafter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#51:1>
The known population gradually grew during the 90s , partly as a
result of more frequent survey , escalating conservation effort , and
successful breeding .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#52:1>
In October 2000 , the international conservation status of this
species was changed by BirdLife International to " Endangered" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#53:1>
However , this species still requires international conservation and
concern . </p> <O> A table </O> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#55:1>
Black-faced Spoonbill is a migratory bird which breeds in the
temperate region during summer; and migrates south to subtropical and
tropical regions in autumn and winter , then returns to the northern breeding
sites in early spring .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#56:1>
The only confirmed breeding grounds are the islands at Changshan
Qundao , off the coast of Liaoning Province of China , and isles located at
the Demilitarized Zone west of the Korean Peninsula . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#57:1>
The three major known wintering grounds of Black-faced Spoonbill
include Tsengwen estuary in Taiwan , Mai Po Inner Deep Bay in Hong Kong , and
the Red River delta in Vietnam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#58:1>
Other wintering sites are located at the coastal areas of Macau SAR ,
Fukian , Guangdong , Gunagxi and Hainan Provinces .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#59:1>
South Korea and Japan have also been found hosting a small wintering
population .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#60:1>
The situation along the coasts between east of the China and Vietnam
is still poorly known . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#61:1>
The Black-faced Spoonbills in Hong Kong are commonly seen around
Mai Po Inner Deep Bay areas including Mai Po Nature Reserve , Tsim Bei Tsui
and Pak Nai .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#62:1>
Sometimes they are found feeding at the fishponds in San Tin and Lok
Ma Chau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#63:1>
Other records away from Deep Bay include Tai Lam Chung , Tai Po ,
Cheung Chau and Starling Inlets .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#64:1>
The resting sites of Black-faced spoonbills are mainly restricted to
shrimp ponds , <it> gei wai </it> in Mai Po Nature Reserve . Sometimes even
the whole flock is gathering at the same place . </p> <O> Three photos </O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#65:1>
<bold> Migration Route </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#66:1>
Black-faced Spoonbill is a migratory species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#67:1>
Every early spring in March , they leave the wintering sites and head
north to accomplish the most critical mission in their life - breeding .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#68:1>
In October they return to their wintering ground .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#69:1>
This life cycle repeats year after year . However , we still don't
know much about their long migration routes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#70:1>
Where do they rest during their tiring journey ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#71:1>
Do they follow the same route when heading to breeding and wintering
grounds ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#72:1>
In order to find out the answers to these questions , ornithologist
from Hong Kong and Taiwan collaborated with Japanese researchers to carry out
the first satellite tracing of this bird species in the winter of 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#73:1>
They were first found moving from Tengwen estuary to the estuary of
Ao Jiang River in early May 1998 , and then located at Xiangshan Gang bay in
mid-May 1998 , but then the signal ceased .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#74:1>
Satellite tracking was performed the following year: 4 birds from the
Tsengwen estuary moved to northern Taiwan and onwards to the coast of
northern Fujian .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#75:1>
These birds , together with the 6 birds tracked from Mai Po in Hong
Kong , which travelled northwards along the coast of eastern China and then
reached Zhejiang , flew northward through the coastal areas of Fujian ,
Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#76:1>
They finally arrived at the islets in the Demilitarized Zone &obrack;  DMZ)
on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#77:1>
This is the fist time that researchers have successfully tracked the
migration of Black-faced spoonbill , which signifies a breakthrough in
learning more about the mysterious aspects of this endangered species . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#79:1>
The adult Black-faced Spoonbills return to breeding grounds
earlier than the juveniles do .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#80:1>
They use old branches and leaves to build nests that perch at the
cliff on the offshore islands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#81:1>
The spoonbills invariably share their breeding grounds at the Korean
peninsula with other shorebirds , like Grey Heron , Cormorant and
Black-tailed Gull . On the islands in the Liaoning Province , the breeding
grounds are shared with Chinese Egret , Little Egret , etc . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#82:1>
After their return the spoonbills start breeding in May .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#83:1>
They begin courtship , mating and laying eggs in early June .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#84:1>
The incubation period usually lasts for about 30 days .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#85:1>
The newly hatched chicks can leave their nests after 35 days .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#86:1>
They stay with their parents for 30 more days in their breeding area
and finally become independent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#87:1>
Researchers discovered three nests in Lioaning Province in early
June of 1999 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#88:1>
One of them was successfully hatched and the chicks were able to
leave the nest .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#89:1>
Another two nests had two and three eggs respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#90:1>
Number of eggs per nest ranges form 2-6 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#91:1>
The egg is mainly white in colour and a bit larger than that of a hen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#92:1>
They are usually stained with their parents ' droppings .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#93:1>
The eggs were believed to be a second brood as the first brood is
usually produced in mid-June . </p> <O> Ten photos </O> <O> Chinese

<bold> Behaviours </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#95:1>
<bold> 1 . Resting </bold> - Black-faced Spoonbill is a
gregarious species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#96:1>
They rest in a big group .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#97:1>
Their resting posture is quite special .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#98:1>
They bend their necks back and place their bills in the back feather .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#99:1>
Only the eyes and a small portion of the faces are exposed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#100:1>
They mostly stand with one leg only . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#101:1>
<bold> 2 . Feeding </bold> - Black-faced Spoonbills feed in a
special way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#102:1>
They often forage in the shallow water &obrack;  5-20 cm &cbrack; , searching out
aquatic animals such as fish and shrimp .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#103:1>
During feeding , they move forward slowly swinging their bills from
side to side . Once the beak makes contact with prey , it will grab it and
lift up the bill , to allow the prey to fall into their mouth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#104:1>
<bold> 3 . Preening </bold> - Like most other birds ,
Black-faced Spoonbills love to be clean .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#105:1>
During resting and after feeding , they like to stand in water ,
flap their wings on the water  ' s surface .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#106:1>
In addition , they use their bills to comb and smooth their feathers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#107:1>
Mutual preening of the head and neck acts as a form of social
communication . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#108:1>
<bold> 4 . Flight </bold> - Black-faced spoonbill extend their
neck and bill when they fly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#109:1>
This is different from that of egrets and herons which fold their
necks . Sometimes , the flying flocks line up in a V-shape or a straight line .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#110:1>
<bold> 5 . Playing </bold> - Young Black-faced Spoonbills like
to play with sticks and other tree branches .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#111:1>
This may help them to build up a better relationship with their
companions . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<bold> Threats faced by Black-faced Spoonbills </bold> </h> <O>
Chinese translation </O> <O> Four pictures and one photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#113:1>
Black-faced spoonbills face serious threats on both their
wintering and breeding grounds , including reclamation , coastal development
, pollution , hunting and human disturbance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#114:1>
Among these , habitat destruction is probably the biggest threat to
this globally endangered species . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#115:1>
<bold> Reclamation and construction </bold> poses the greatest
threat to Black-faced Spoonbill .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#116:1>
For example , the Taipa-Colane mudflats in Macau , which support
5&percent; of the global spoonbill population , will be adversely affected by
a reclamation project that includes various planned infrastructure , sports
facilities , film city , a casino , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#117:1>
The extensive intertidal mudflat of Ariake bay at Isahaya in Japan
has been dammed and hence dried up since 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#118:1>
Construction of Inchon International Airport in South Korea in the
mid 90s led to the reclamation of wetland on Sammok and Yongjong islands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#119:1>
A study in China showed that about 21,900 km2 of tidal wetland &obrack; 
about 50&percent; of the total area of coastal wetlands &cbrack; has been reclaimed
in china since 1949 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#120:1>
<bold> Economic and facilities development </bold> has converted
many coastal wetlands into aquaculture ponds , planting site and industrial
estates , all of which can be found in Hong Kong , Guangxi , Hainan and
Vietnam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#121:1>
In Guangdong , development in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone ,
has greatly reduced the area of Futian Nature Reserve in Deep Bay , as
fishponds there have been reclaimed and the nature reserve has been reduced
to a narrow strip of mangroves along the northern coast of the bay .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#122:1>
The new construction plan of the western corridor might cross over
the Deep Bay area between Hong Kong and Shenzhen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#123:1>
<bold> Pollution </bold> is mainly menacing the wintering
Black-faced Spoonbill .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#124:1>
For instance , pollution from industry and domestic sewage affects
wintering birds in Hong Kong and Shenzhen in China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#125:1>
In December 2002 at Tseng-wen Estuary in Tainan , a kind of bacteria
, <it> <foreign> Clostridium botulinum </foreign> </it> , was found to claim
the lives of over 70 Black-faced Spoonbills , about 7&percent; of the global
population .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#126:1>
In addition , pesticides and fertilizers used extensively in the
paddies around the Red River Delta of Vietnam were found draining into the
wetland area , which may pose threats to the survival of Black-faced
Spoonbills . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#127:1>
<bold> Hunting </bold> is unscrupulously common in China and
Vietnam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#128:1>
At Liaoning , fishermen in China collect waterbird eggs at nesting
sites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#129:1>
Also , birds are still being shot even inside the core protected
area of Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#130:1>
In Chi-ku in Tainan , one spoonbill was found shot dead while
another was seriously injured at the end of 1992 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#131:1>
This was believed to be a vindictive act by the locals , as
apparently presence of the spoonbills would prevent that area from
development .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#132:1>
In Red River delta of Vietnam , the spoonbills are put in peril by
the large mist nets , airguns and shooting guns . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#133:1>
<bold> Disturbance </bold> caused by tourism is one of the main
threats to Black-faced Spoonbills .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#134:1>
For example , Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve of Hainan and Tsim Bei
Tsui of Hong Kong are famous for their mangrove habitats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#135:1>
And large numbers of visitors increase pressure to the areas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#136:1>
Mudskipper collectors in Hong Kong and mollusc and crab collectors
in Vietnam overlap habitat in intertidal areas , and this causes disturbance
to spoonbills and waterbirds . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

The first meeting for the conservation of Black-faced Spoonbills
was held in August 1994 during the world conference of BirdLife International .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#140:1>
Representatives from various countries including Japan , North Korea
, Taiwan and Vietnam participated in the meeting .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#141:1>
It was agreed to develop a conservation plan to protect this
globally threatened species .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#142:1>
An international workshop organized in Taipei in January 1995 by the
BirdLife partner , the Wild Bird Federation of Taiwan , on the conservation
of this species , and an " Action Plan for the Black-faced Spoonbill, <it>
Platalea minor </it> &rdquo; was produced in the same year as a guideline for
conservation of the species . Follow-up workshops held in Beijing &obrack;  1996 &cbrack; and
Tokyo &obrack;  1997 &cbrack; , which involved experts from countries in the region , brought
the conservation a great step forward .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#143:1>
Many recommendations made in the Action Plan and the workshops have
been implemented , including the production of education leaflets and posters
on spoonbill conservation , joint censuses , cooperation on
satellite-tracking to study migration , and studies at key sites in all range
countries . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#144:1>
<bold> Legislation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#145:1>
All bird species in Hong Kong , including Black-faced Spoonbill
, are protected under the &ldquo; Wild Animals Protection Ordinance" , Cap .
170 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#146:1>
The species is included on the Red List of Japan , which means that
its conservation importance is recognized and it can be used as a reference
species in environmental impact assessment for development projects .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#147:1>
In South Korea , it was designated as Natural Monument no . 205 on
30 May 1968 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#148:1>
In mainland China it is a National Protected Species &obrack;  Second Grade)
, while in Taiwan it is protected as a Category I &obrack;  highest priority)
protected species , on the list announced in December 1995 . However , in
Vietnam , the species is not yet officially protected although it is already
listed in the Vietnamese Red Data Book . </p> <h>

<bold> Hong Kong: </bold> Mai Po Marshes was declared as a
&ldquo; No Hunting Area &rdquo; in 1973 , and restriction on access ,
scheduled under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance , Cap . 170 , was
strictly enforced to prevent disturbances to wild animals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#151:1>
In 1995 , the Mai Po marshes and Inner Deep Bay wetland &obrack;  15 km2)
was formally designated as a Ramsar site , and the Inner Deep Bay became a
restricted area in 1996 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#152:1>
A comprehensive conservation strategy and a management plan were
completed for Mai Po marshes in 1997 , and the Hong Kong government
implemented the projects and management structure thereafter . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#153:1>
<bold> Mainland China: </bold> several important sites of this
species have already been designated as protected areas , including Yancheng
Nature Reserve in Jiangsu , Shankou Nature Reserve in Guangxi , Fiutian
Nature Reserve in Guangdong and Dongzhaigang nature Reserve on Hainan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#154:1>
The newly discovered breeding site at Xingren Tuo island in Liaoning
has been designated as a non-hunting area .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#155:1>
Access to the island is prohibited without permission from the
Forestry Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#156:1>
<bold> Taiwan: </bold> the Taiwanese government has already
frozen some potential development plans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#157:1>
Some local conservation bodies are now keeping a close eye on the
spoonbill status and potential threats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#158:1>
<bold> Japan: </bold> regular wintering sites at Izumi-Takaono
in Kagoshima and Manko on Okinawa , and occasional wintering grounds at Yatsu
in Chiba and Nakaumi in Tottori and Shimane , are National Wildlife
Protection Areas; Manko was even designated as a Ramsar Site in 1999 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#159:1>
<bold> Korea: </bold> Taegan-do , Unmu-do , Sonchonrap-do and
Tok-do in North Korea have all been designated as seabird breeding
sanctuaries </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#160:1>
<bold> Vietnam: </bold> Xuan Thuy and Tien Hai have been
established as nature reserves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#161:1>
Xuan Thuy was established as the first Ramsar site in Vietnam in
1989 , and in 1995 the area was designated a nature reserve &obrack;  120 km2 &cbrack; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#163:1>
<bold> 1 . Satellite-tracking </bold> - International
satellite-tracking studies carried out in 1997/98 and 1998/99 in Taiwan and
Hong Kong have deepened our knowledge of the migratory movement of this
species and identified some important breeding and migratory sites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#164:1>
The project was jointly implemented by Wild Bird Federation of
Taiwan , Tainan Wild Bird Society; Biology department of National Taiwan
University , Wild Bird Society of Japan , Yamashina Institute for Ornithology
, Hong Kong Bird Watching Society , World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong ,
etc .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#165:1>
The study was carried out in 1997/98 and 98/99 , and by late June
1999 almost all of the tagged spoonbills were found on the island near the
western coast of the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#166:1>
This is probably the most important breeding ground for Black-faced
spoonbills in the world , where protection is afforded by the current
security situation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#167:1>
However , concerning the migratory route from northern Jiangsu to
the western coast of Korea , nothing is known and more tracking work is
needed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#168:1>
<bold> Satellite transmitter </bold> - about 15-25 g . will be
detached from the body in a year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#169:1>
The battery life depends on the frequency of signal transmissions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#170:1>
Signals were sent out from the transmitter on the bird body at a
regular time interval , received by satellite , and then returned to the
receiver on ground .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#171:1>
This enables researchers to get information on their migration route
, transition area and breeding sites . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#172:1>
<bold> 2 . Radio-transmitter tracking </bold> - In winter
2002/03 , 11 Black-faced Spoonbills were captured this winter under a project
carried out by the Agriculture , Fisheries and Conservation Department &obrack; 
AFCD &cbrack; and researchers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#173:1>
The spoonbills were fitted with leg bands and radio-transmitters in
order to find out detailed ecological information on individual Black-faced
Spoonbill movements between the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site and the
areas nearby . Similar study was carried out in Chi-ku of Tainan in 1996 to
study their behaviour and activity , while information on their habitat
characteristics including water depth , area , and height of pond bunds were
also recorded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#174:1>
<bold> Radio transmitter </bold> - Researchers use receivers and
antenna to receive radio signals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#175:1>
These help them to locate the Black-faced Spoonbill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#176:1>
<bold> 3 . Colour bands </bold> were tied on Black-faced
spoonbills in Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1997/1998 and 1998/1999 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#177:1>
This study shows that there is some interchange of birds between
Hong Kong and Taiwan , and also between other wintering sites . Of the two
nestlings from Tok-do island in North Korea &obrack;  banded in July 1995 &cbrack; , one was
seen at Izumi on Kyushu Japan in November 1995 , but the other arrived at the
Red River delta in Vietnam in December 1995 , indicating birds from the same
breeding locality may winter in different places . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#178:1>
<bold> 4 . International Census </bold> - was begun in winter
1994 by experts in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , Vietnam and Korea . A global
census conducted during winter of 2001-02 indicated that there were 970 known
birds .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#179:1>
Thereafter the BirdLife International affiliate Hong Kong Bird
Watching Society was appointed to coordinate the international census in
winter 2002-03 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#180:1>
Coordinated by the Spoonbill Research Group of the Hong Kong
Bird Watching Society , the survey was carried out by experts from important
wintering sites throughout Asia simultaneously from 24 to 26 January 2003 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#181:1>
The result was collected and presented in the website of Hong Kong
Bird Watching Society at <bold> http://www.hkbws.org.hk/waterbird/bfs.html
</bold> , to facilitate information exchange and to provide an overall global
picture of the wintering population of the globally threatened Black-faced
Spoonbill and the conservation importance of its wintering habitats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#182:1>
Participants for the census include ornithologists and bird watchers
from Hainan , Guangdong , Xiamen , Shanghai , Jiangxi of China mainland ,
Hong Kong , Macau , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Vietnam , Thailand and
Philippines .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#183:1>
The project was kindly supported by the AFCD and included as a part
of the Waterbird Monitoring Programme at the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar
Site . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#184:1>
<bold> 5 . Age structure of wintering spoonbill </bold> - The
Black-faced Spoonbill Research Group is now assisting the AFCD to conduct an
assessment on the age structure of Wintering Black-faced Spoonbill at Mai Po
Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#185:1>
This study commenced in 1998 , so the study conducted this year is
already the fourth consecutive one .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#186:1>
Both of the studies in winters of 2000/01 and 2001/02 showed that
about 60&percent; of the wintering spoonbill population are adults .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#187:1>
The study is useful for predicting the global population of
Black-faced Spoonbill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#188:1>
<bold> 6 . Captive breeding </bold> - A breeding programme for
Black-faced spoonbill was initiated in Tama Zoo in Tokyo , Japan , in the mid
90s .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#189:1>
A total of 21 eggs were laid from 1986 to 1998 , four of which
successfully hatched . </p> <O> Three photos </O> <O> Chinese translation

<bold> Public Education </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-028#191:1>
In Hong Kong , the Hong Kong Bird Watching society keeps regular
contact with the press regarding updated information on the species besides
organizing the census .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#192:1>
Education programmes including outings , lectures and training were
organized among schools and communities to raise their awareness and help
them to identify the species accurately .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#193:1>
Local NGOs including WWF HK designed a new image &ldquo; Lu-Lu
&rdquo; for the species as a part of their programme , which appeals much to
the general public .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#194:1>
The Conservancy Association also organizes community development
programmes to convey the message of the importance of wetlands to the public .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#195:1>
Other places such as in Taiwan , the Chinese Wild Bird Federation
has also initiated and actively promoted the conservation status of the
spoonbills .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#196:1>
Posters and pamphlets in different languages have been produced and
distributed to a range of countries .

<ICE-HK:W2B-028#197:1>
A Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Society and the Provincial
Endemic Species Research and Conservation Centre were also formed and are now
involved actively in Black-faced Spoonbill conservation . </p>
