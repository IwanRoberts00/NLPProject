Hong Kong  ' s airport project is once again facing an uncertain
future tonight

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#7:1:B>
High level talks between British and Chinese officials ended today
in Beijing without any agreement on the crucial area of financing <,>

John Coles declared that they had failed to persuade their Chinese
counterparts to accept the airport finance package <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#11:1:C>
He said the Chinese side had raised many questions <,> and the
British delegation had tried to address their concerns especially on the
provisional <?> callable </?> equity in the finance package

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#12:1:C>
But they couldn't get a clear answer from Beijing on the issue <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#13:1:C>
Sir John predicted there will be more trouble ahead if solutions
aren't found soon <O> speech by Sir John Coles </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#14:1:C>
He said the Sino-British Airport Committee will continue the
discussions next week in Hong Kong <,> and it depends on how much progress
can be made at the Committee to see if another round of high-level talks is
needed <,>

the British delegation and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Xueqian at <?> Chung Nan

More local news and the number of non-refugee Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong has dropped below fifty thousand for the first time since
nineteen eighty-eight

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#59:1:B>
The government says this shows the Involuntary Return Program has
discouraged people from leaving Vietnam and encouraged people to volunteer to
go home

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#60:1:B>
Only seven arrivals have been recorded so far this year

Lau says a survey conducted earlier this year shows eighty-two
percent of commuters are against the rush-hour surcharge

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#64:1:B>
But the MTRC reiterated today that the extra charge will stay while
the corporation finds other means to improve its services during the peak
periods

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#65:1:B>
However Lau is pushing for a completely independent monitoring body
to keep a watchful eye on the MTRC <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#66:1:B>
Currently the corporation controls its own fare structure

The failure of the Sino-British high-level talks on the
airport will not immediately delay the project and it  ' s hoped that with the
new governor in place a solution could be expedited <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#115:2:A>
Among the ten airport core projects only two of them <,> the
airport itself and the rail link are in the scope of the Sino-British dispute
over financing

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#116:2:A>
Funding for the other eight projects are provided for in the
Public Works budget or through privatization <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#117:2:A>
Tenders for the site formation contract for the airport is due to
be called in late August <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#118:2:A>
But legislator Samuel Wong among others believes two to three
months delay will not hurt the project

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-007#119:2:C>
I don't think it will uh <,> unless it it drag on for say uh
half a year or a year

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#120:2:C>
Otherwise it won't

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#121:2:C>
I think it it it it will uh pretty much uh uh business going on as
usual <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#122:2:C>
Uh what the argument at the moment is uh the the the financing
method and how to deal with this uh uh callable equity

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#123:2:C>
How to account for it in in in in terms of accountancy and so on
uh balance sheet and so on

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#124:2:C>
Uh and the that will certainly affect the ability to borrow money
at a cheaper rate during the year of say nineteen ninety-three and nineteen
ninety-four

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#128:2:D>
Because of the breakdown it will lead to the the uh increase
of uh political risk as well as uh the time factor

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#129:2:D>
Uhm because of the political risk involve the banker or the
financial institution <,> when they negotiate loan uh with the PAA as well as
the MTRC they will uh put forward a a a more harsh condition as well as
higher interest

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#130:2:D>
And also because of the time factor

<ICE-HK:S2B-007#131:2:D>
