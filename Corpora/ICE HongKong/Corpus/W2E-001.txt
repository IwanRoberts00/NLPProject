<ICE-HK:W2E-001#2:1>
Even though mortgage rates have fallen to three per cent , the
lowest in as many years , and flat prices have more than halved since the
peak of 1997 , tens of thousands of vacant flats are still looking for buyers .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#3:1>
No wonder the Government is said to be considering slashing the
public sector  ' s housing production target by one-third , from 45,700 flats a
year to about 32,000 .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#4:1>
In fact , the original target has long been in effect ditched , and
the current move is aimed at reconciling policy with reality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#5:1>
But a deeper question that policy-makers need to ask is about the
future of public housing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#6:1>
Hong Kong  ' s public housing programme was conceived at a time when
the territory was much poorer .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#7:1>
The provision of cheap rental flats for hundreds of thousands of
low-income families has been a pillar of stability in a place where
disparities of wealth abound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#8:1>
In time , flats have also been built for sale at subsidised rates
to families who want to own their homes but are not well off enough to buy in
the private market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#9:1>
During the process , a monolithic Housing Authority and Housing
Department that employ more than 10,000 civil servants has also been
established . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#10:1>
But the argument for subsidised home sales has always been weak .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#11:1>
Market forces have been able to drive down the costs of housing to
affordable levels in most places .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#12:1>
There is no reason why Hong Kong cannot do the same , unless we
accept that the biggest stumbling block here is that the Government is the
biggest landlord as it owns all the land . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#13:1>
A case could also be made for giving eligible households rental
vouchers instead of maintaining a big bureaucracy to build flats for them .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#14:1>
Clearly , the currently depressed state of the private housing
market has provided an opportunity for the Government to rethink its housing
strategy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#15:1>
The move towards providing housing loans and rental subsidies
instead of building yet more flats for eligible households is a step in the
right direction , as is the decision to require the Housing Authority to turn
over sites vacated by the demolition of old public housing estates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#16:1>
Contrary to its avowed free-market economic philosophy , the
Government  ' s participation in the housing market has been great .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#17:1>
It is time it reduced its involvement and gave the private sector
more room to meet the population  ' s housing aspirations . </p>

<h> <bold> Defining the problem </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#19:2>
To say that all Muslim nations think alike is to be ignorant of
the religion and its regional diversities .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#20:2>
For this reason , it is wrong of Israel to suppose that Yasser Arafat
can control the political views of his people simply because they share the
same prayer book . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#21:2>
Nowhere has the diversity been more apparent than at this week  ' s
summit of the Organisation of Islamic Conference in Kuala Lumpur .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#22:2>
The inability of the 50 participating nations to reach consensus on
curbing terrorism - because they cannot agree on the definition of a
terrorist - highlights the problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#23:2>
Israel says Mr Arafat is as much a terrorist as the Palestinian
suicide bombers who are killing Israeli civilians .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#24:2>
They say the Palestinian leader can prevent extremists and his
inability to do so is justification to hold him as a prisoner . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#25:2>
Muslim nations are united in their condemnation of Israel , yet
they cannot agree on whether the bombers are terrorists .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#26:2>
Arab nations , especially Iran , Iraq and Syria , say attacks against
Israel are a just response to Israeli aggression .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#27:2>
More moderate nations , such as Malaysia , think otherwise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#28:2>
This disharmony of opinion has derailed Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad  ' s attempts at the summit to find common Muslim ground in
dealing with the question of how to tackle terrorism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#29:2>
His desire is admirable and his call on Monday for a resolution
was enlightening .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#30:2>
Nations worldwide are using the events of September 11 in the US to
justify harsh action against political opponents and long-running
insurgencies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#31:2>
Dr Mahathir also has problems with growing Muslim fundamentalism
in Malaysia , but it is wrong to call religious opposition terrorism .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#32:2>
Although his recognition of the lack of a definition of terrorism is
to be applauded , complex issues - such as that involving the Israelis and
Palestinians - cannot be dealt with by committees using a set of rules . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#34:3>
Dedicated viewers of Hong Kong  ' s bid to join the technology
revolution can watch the action unfold live on Cyberport  ' s official Web site .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#35:3>
Unfortunately , those expecting inspiring scenes of skateboarding
technologists networking over cappuccinos will be disappointed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#36:3>
Conceived as a government-run effort to hoist the SAR up the
technology ladder , officials have confirmed what had become an open secret
in recent months .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#37:3>
Little demand exists for a glitzy , yet remote , campus development ,
despite knock-down rents and huge pressure on big-name firms to move . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#38:3>
Hong Kong  ' s effort to copy Silicon Valley  ' s success had a
controversial birth when the project was not opened for competitive tender .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#39:3>
Critics charged that tried-and-tested laissez-faire principles had
been compromised .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#40:3>
Most pointedly they argued that Hong Kong had no need for such a
project as firms would be loath to relocate staff to a suburban backwater .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#41:3>
It is far too early to dub Cyberport a white elephant , but
yesterday  ' s confirmation that only three tenants have signed up to its first
phase is pitiful .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#42:3>
Official claims that all is well with the letting process look
increasingly foolish . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#43:3>
Less than two years ago the Government and Pacific Century
CyberWorks joint venture claimed expressions of interest from 155 firms that
included many blue chip technology giants .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#44:3>
Yet when push came to shove , fears of being isolated from the
commercial hub and employees ' reluctance to endure the commute seem the main
sticking points . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#45:3>
Officials can justly point to the collapse in the technology
sector  ' s prospects and the project  ' s building site status .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#46:3>
However , firms ' cautious promises to consider a move during the
project  ' s later phase suggest a face-saving get-out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#47:3>
Part of the problem is the grinding fall in rents caused by
rising office supply and a poor economy .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#48:3>
If firms can renegotiate existing leases at attractive rates they
have little incentive to move and incur expensive fit-out costs .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#49:3>
Cyberport  ' s high management fees do not help .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#50:3>
The promise of free broadband Internet access is hardly a major draw
as intense competition among service providers forces bandwidth prices ever
lower . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#51:3>
An increasing amount of academic research suggests government
efforts to foster technology clustering has limited success .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#52:3>
Indeed , the partially complete Hong Kong Science Park in Tai Po is
also struggling to find tenants for its applied research and testing centre
despite rock-bottom rents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#53:3>
The Government faces hard choices .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#54:3>
With the hotly contested Route 7 road link not slated for completion
until 2010 at the earliest , poor access will dog Cyberport for years to come .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#55:3>
With the market so far seemingly rejecting the venture it may be
time to consider the unthinkable .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#56:3>
Many government agencies and university departments are crying out
for improved facilities .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#57:3>
Rather than lease spanking new office space at &ldquo; any price &rdquo; ,
alternative uses should perhaps be considered .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#58:3>
The whole exercise could then be put down to experience . </p>

<h> <bold> Moment of truth </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#60:4>
The Middle East is imploding and the world community is sitting
on its hands .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#61:4>
Under the media glare that is constantly on the Israelis and
Palestinians , the words of protest may seem loud , but without further
action they are meaningless . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#62:4>
Hundreds of lives have been lost in 18 months of tit-for-tat
terror .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#63:4>
The human toll soars , yet diplomatic efforts lack urgency .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#64:4>
Envoys have come and gone while the people who could make a
difference - United States President George W . Bush , United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair - have
stayed away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#65:4>
The maxim that talk is cheap was never truer . Resolutions at the
UN have always meant little when combatants are locked in battle .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#66:4>
Arab calls for a peacekeeping force have been ignored and Israel ,
deaf-eared , has pushed on unimpeded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#67:4>
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon  ' s hounding of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat was bound to inflame Palestinian passions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#68:4>
Militarily impotent , their response - suicide attacks on Israeli
targets - drew an obvious response .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#69:4>
But Mr Sharon  ' s imprisoning of Mr Arafat , an elected leader , in
his compound , and its destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure has
taken the conflict to a step beyond reason . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#70:4>
Hezbollah guerillas in Lebanon have now entered the fray ,
resuming attacks on Israeli targets .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#71:4>
Israel has a military challenge on this new front and Lebanon has
warned that the Arab world could get sucked into the fighting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#72:4>
Lessons were painfully learned following similar international
inaction towards Rwanda and the Balkans .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#73:4>
The images of the pain and suffering in the Middle East are just as
horrendous , yet there is no rush to correct the mistakes of the past . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#74:4>
Mr Bush  ' s war on global terrorism is inextricably tied up in the
Arab-Israeli conflict .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#75:4>
It was one of the reasons for the September 11 attacks in New York
and Washington and it is why the word &ldquo; terrorist ' has become so
misused by both sides . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#76:4>
Arabs and Jews have been at war for centuries .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#77:4>
Their problems will not be solved by warnings , threats or
condemnations .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#78:4>
Only with tough international mediation and the use of peacekeepers
can the powder keg be prevented from exploding . </p>

<h> <bold> Elderly deserve better </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#80:5>
The unhappy conditions in which many of Hong Kong  ' s elderly live
is cause for concern , and reflects poorly on a society that has
traditionally taken great care of the aged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#81:5>
A study commissioned by the Government on the state of our senior
citizens makes depressing reading .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#82:5>
Thirty per cent of the suicides in Hong Kong involve the aged , even
though they make up only 14 per cent of the population .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#83:5>
On an average , one case of elderly suicide is reported every 1.5
days . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#84:5>
Perhaps predictably , poor health and depression are revealed to
be major causes for suicide .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#85:5>
More alarmingly , physical abuse is also found to be a cause for
suicide among the aged .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#86:5>
The 143 cases of abuse reported in 1999 to the Social Welfare
Department is in all likelihood a small percentage of the actual number of
cases , given the natural reluctance of people to complain formally about
being abused .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#87:5>
This is especially so when family members and carers are those
responsible for the problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#88:5>
The elderly and the very young are the two most vulnerable social
groups .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#89:5>
Caring for your children is something that comes a lot more naturally
than caring for elderly parents , especially when money and resources are
scarce .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#90:5>
As our news report points out , elderly people who are financially
dependent on their children are often regarded as a burden .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#91:5>
There are cases of aged people who spend their time wandering the
streets because of strained relationships with their children .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#92:5>
This alienation is one cause of suicide . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#93:5>
The Government would do well to examine the pros and cons of
introducing legislation to protect the aged from abuse .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#94:5>
While it is true that the mere existence of a law will not prevent
abuse , it will act as a deterrent .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#95:5>
It will also demonstrate that Hong Kong is a society that is willing
to protect its elderly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#96:5>
In addition , the Government should consider targeting a larger
proportion of its welfare spending on care for the elderly .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#97:5>
Elderly men and women should not be forced to work in demeaning
occupations in order to earn enough to stay alive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#98:5>
There is a clear case for additional resources to be spent on
housing , feeding and caring for Hong Kong  ' s elderly , so that they are not
forced by poverty , ill health and neglect into taking their lives . </p>

Warnings of Afghanistan  ' s slide back into anarchy have always
been pushed aside by optimists .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#101:6>
As the interim administration staggers towards the end of its
six-month term , it is obvious the pessimists were right and that the country  ' s
international saviours have been blinded into inactivity by the euphoria of
their good deeds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#102:6>
The similarities to what happened in the aftermath of the
Soviet invasion in the 1980s are striking .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#103:6>
The Soviets also believed they could quickly put their stamp on
Afghanistan , but soon found it impossible to rein in the dissident elements
in far-flung provinces beyond the capital , Kabul . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#104:6>
After the defeated Soviets pulled out in 1989 and a glimmer of
hope shone for a united government , the provincial warlords scuppered United
Nations-initiated moves . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#105:6>
This same scenario now stares the United States , Britain and
other members of the alliance against global terrorism in the face .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#106:6>
Their good intentions and well-meaning actions have cost billions
of dollars , but done little to restore the promised law , order and security .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#107:6>
Most alarming in recent days has been the uncovering of an
alleged plot to overthrow interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#108:6>
Hundreds of people have been arrested for planning bomb attacks in
Kabul and ethnic Pashtun warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is said to be behind
them .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#109:6>
Right-wing Islamic groups have been accused of financing robberies
and murders . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-001#110:6>
American and British officials have in recent weeks recognised
that their work has only just begun .

<ICE-HK:W2E-001#111:6>
Billions of dollars in financial pledges was a start , but
Afghanistan also needs stability and security , and it is up to the world
community to ensure these are in place . </p>
