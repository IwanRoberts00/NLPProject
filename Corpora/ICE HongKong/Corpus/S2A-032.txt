Good evening ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#2:1:A>
I  ' m glad that from the onset the proposition side has agreed with
us that <.> stabidity </.> stability should be uppermost in our mind during
the latter half of the transitional period

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#3:1:A>
But this stability how can we achieve this

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#4:1:A>
And they have also mentioned that changes if there should be must be
within or within confines or in accordance with the Basic Law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#5:1:A>
And so far they have stated an American committee style system which
in fact itself is not a real American style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#6:1:A>
And it it should adopt the real American style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#7:1:A>
It is definitely without the confines of the Basic Law which ruled
the stabilized <.> de </.> delicate situation of Hong Kong at the moment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#8:1:A>
And <,> throughout the debate our side has repeatedly mentioned this

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#9:1:A>
That the real American style system should include the power to
initiate bills <.> lik </.> including the power to initiate bills concerning
public expenditure

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#10:1:A>
This is part and partial to the committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#11:1:A>
And I  ' ve already talked so long about this

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#12:1:A>
So I  ' m not going to go on it anymore

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#13:1:A>
But ladies and gentlemen be reminded that we have mentioned about
it

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#14:1:A>
And also <,> the American style committee system <,> what we think
that it would introduce by introduction of the American style committee
system it would bring with it revolutionary changes what we want at the
moment

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#15:1:A>
Of course there maybe some weaknesses in the present system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#16:1:A>
All systems have its weaknesses but we need is to strike a balance
between changes and stability

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#17:1:A>
And the proposition side in fact has not proved very clearly that
the present systems weaknesses are so strong that we need to bring into the
Hong Kong situation a totally foreign system to <.> mak </.> to remedy these
weaknesses

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#18:1:A>
They have mentioned about political expertise but do we need to <.>
i uh </.> to copy the American style committee system to educate our
legislators

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#19:1:A>
Also they have talked about the power of some <?> of the </?>
officials

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#20:1:A>
In fact by the Power and Privileges Ordinance nineteen eighty five
<,> in section nine subsection one <,> the power <.> ini </.> to summon
officials to give information and to <?> stand its </?> weaknesses are in
fact extended to standard committees

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#21:1:A>
And by subsection two are extended to all other committees as well
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#22:1:A>
And also they talked about <.> effi </.> inefficiency

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#23:1:A>
In fact our side has mentioned that inefficiency is definitely not
a very great problem because by the number of bills which passed throughout
the year it is just good indicator that efficiency is definitely what we have

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#24:1:A>
Without <unc> one-word </unc> find other ways to improve or
to further enhance

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#25:1:A>
And also monitory powers

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#26:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we have mentioned that to monitor government
is not only the work of the Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#27:1:A>
In fact we  ' ve already advocated in <?> purpose </?> like relaxing
or repealing the Official Secrets Act but they have not responded throughout
the debate that this is in fact an incremental change that would be better
than bringing in into Hong Kong a totally foreign and revolutionary committee
system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#28:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen as we have mentioned from the very beginning
stability in the transitional period a smooth transition is what should be
uppermost in our mind <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#29:1:A>
They  ' ve talked about the characteristics or the advantages so
called of the American style committee system that permanent uh permanent
structure <.> from </.> uh formalization staff and open government

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#30:1:A>
In fact these are only means to serve the end that is to enhance
the functions of the Legislature as we  ' ve mentioned

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#31:1:A>
Legislation checking the government and also controlling the
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#32:1:A>
Ladies and gentlemen during the latter half of the transitional
period I should say that revolutionary changes should be avoided

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#33:1:A>
Of course made in America is a label that usually guarantee for
good quality but at this stage what we need is made in Hong Kong which suits
the uniqueness of the situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#34:1:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>                                

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-032#35:2:A>
Good evening ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#36:2:A>
At this hour tonight I think all of you including me are already
very tired and especially exhausted by the confusing arguments of our
opponents

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#37:2:A>
Well let me thank them for their research on the <.> constitu </.>
on the uh American Constitution and also their research on the American style
committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#38:2:A>
I want to say that your research is not wasted

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#39:2:A>
However it is my utmost responsibility to clarify our points once
more

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#40:2:A>
First the American style committee system as said by our captain
has mentioned repeatedly many many times

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#41:2:A>
We are not introducing the power of initiating bills and killing
bills into the Hong Kong Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#42:2:A>
The reason is clear

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#43:2:A>
It is because these are actually delegated by the American Congress

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#44:2:A>
Mind you the American Congress

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#45:2:A>
If if they are to be introduced into the Hong Kong Legislative
Council are we going to change the whole legislative structure in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#46:2:A>
Sure not

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#47:2:A>
It  ' s insensible <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#48:2:A>
And moreover our opponents have raised the following points

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#49:2:A>
First that is about the Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#50:2:A>
It says that he says he said that the Legco <.> a </.>
accountability is a strange analogy to the <.> ca </.> to the American style
committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#51:2:A>
However in Basic Law Article sixty four it states that we have to
make Legco to be accountable to the Government

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#52:2:A>
How it is to be done

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#53:2:A>
That is by strengthening the monitoring role of the Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#54:2:A>
By having an efficient and effective expertise being built in the
Legco <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#55:2:A>
Secondly they said that they want evolution not revolution and they
want stability

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#56:2:A>
Yes we agree with that

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#57:2:A>
However we are not radical

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#58:2:A>
But in fact we are rational and incremental

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#59:2:A>
We are not changing the entire present system but do something to
improve the present system in the Legco by introducing the American style
committee system into it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#60:2:A>
They also mentioned that we sorry excuse me we have to mention that
changes are necessary to prepare Legco for the addition <.> or </.> for the
additional power given to them by the Basic Law after nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#61:2:A>
Without such preparation <?> in fact </?> will be far worse than
having a structure that utilizes expertise

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#62:2:A>
Well interestingly I just come across the slogan of the Hong Kong U
Students  '  Union which says we care we voice

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#63:2:A>
We  ' re so glad to see that because these students from Hong Kong U
do have the same attitude with us

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#64:2:A>
Yes but I want to add one more

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#65:2:A>
We see we care and thus we voice <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#66:2:A>
And thirdly about the point on the thirty minutes minute sorry the
thirty-minute meeting of the Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#67:2:A>
Well thirty minutes meeting of the Legco doesn't mean anything of
efficiency

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#68:2:A>
Mind you it may only mean no insight and no in depth discussion on
the issue

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#69:2:A>
What you know about the Legco and what you know about the reality

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#70:2:A>
They uh the reality is that because there are in fact one hundred
bills queuing up there for <?> scrutinization </?> so that  ' s why they need
thirty minutes

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#71:2:A>
Thirty minutes

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#72:2:A>
From actual data you see that the number of ad hoc groups increases
from forty eight in nineteen ninety to ninety one to the number of seventy
one this year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#73:2:A>
Let me repeat the points that we have raised before ladies and
gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#74:2:A>
First the American style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#75:2:A>
In fact I don't want to waste time to <?> drawl </?> into this
because I feel you with an open mind have already understood that

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#76:2:A>
Well let me bring you to the Hong Kong context that is the problems
that we are facing

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#77:2:A>
First we do not have sufficient expertise being built in the
Legislative system to deal with the <?> problem </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#78:2:A>
Second there is relatively low efficiency in tackling with these
<?> problems </?> in terms of time and resources

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#79:2:A>
And third the monitoring role of the Legislative Council to check
on the Government is not strong enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#80:2:A>
However if we have the American style committee system being
introduced into Hong Kong Legco such problems can be served can be solved

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#81:2:A>
The characteristics of the American style committee system are
permanence formal structure and style as well as openness to public

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#82:2:A>
These will bring about advantages of effectiveness expertise and
accountability

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#83:2:A>
These advantages in fact totally and rightly solve the problems in
Hong Kong that now our Legislative Council is facing and these are already
explained in full detail by our speakers

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#84:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen our argument is clear

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#85:2:A>
We don't want to contradict the Basic Law and we don't want to
antagonize Beijing Government

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#86:2:A>
Even our governor Chris Patten believes that there is a danger of
confusion and muddling in the roles of Executive Council and Legco at the
present stage

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#87:2:A>
So please we have no other option please there is no other choice
but <&> speech interrupted by chairlady </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#88:2:A>
Thank you very much </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-032#89:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen I sum up from the captain <?> what they
</?> have said who should do the saving

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#90:3:A>
So let me give you an analogy on this

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#91:3:A>
A <?> couple </?> right in front of me are coach Doctor <?>
Changrin </?> and Mrs <?> Changrin </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#92:3:A>
What if Doctor <?> Changrin </?> is saving all his money <?> that
</?> what if Mrs <unc> one- word </unc> is on the other hand taking
out all the money from the bank account

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#93:3:A>
Doctor <unc> one-word </unc> saves but she is taking so as
a result the bank account will be zero

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#94:3:A>
The real truth behind saving is both parties must cooperate that
what we are promoting today in today  ' s motion

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#95:3:A>
Cooperation is the main goal

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#96:3:A>
And I sum up from the second speaker

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#97:3:A>
She asks well make your own bed you lie on it

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#98:3:A>
That  ' s fine

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#99:3:A>
Yes that  ' s true but ladies and gentlemen environment is global <.>
re </.>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#100:3:A>
May I repeat environment is global

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#101:3:A>
It is not a bed to a particular nation

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#102:3:A>
Yes you can lie on your own bed and forget about the whole world
but environmental issues are threatening you and me globally

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#103:3:A>
What I hear some of them from the third speaker is that they are
contradicting themselves because they said that they will not confine
themselves to monetary terms but summing up from him though it is all from
monetary terms so please don't confine ourselves to the monetary payments

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#104:3:A>
Sacrificing one form with another is a form of payment already <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#105:3:A>
So what is the example

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#106:3:A>
If the third world countries could export more tax <unc>
one-word </unc> their need to sell the timber would be less desperate

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#107:3:A>
If Europe  ' s farmers were not protected then the land values would
be lower so as a result they would have less incentives to farm intensively
<,> so ladies and gentlemen the world belongs to everyone of us

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#108:3:A>
The problems also belongs to all of us here

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#109:3:A>
Firstly recognizing that the major environmental problems of the
developing countries are not necessarily of the same nature as those of
developed countries

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#110:3:A>
The pollution <.> ga </.> greenhouse gas emission deforestation
endangered species they are all difficult to solve and are all different from
one country to another

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#111:3:A>
India is facing the serious problem of endangered species

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#112:3:A>
And the US is facing serious problem in greenhouse gas emission

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#113:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen there is an old Chinese saying that every
family has their own set of bible

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#114:3:A>
There is national air there is national water and there is
national environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#115:3:A>
Nobody understands the Chinese air the Chinese water the Chinese
soil better than a Chinese man

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#116:3:A>
Each region understands its own problems

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#117:3:A>
However your first speaker says that the air well we can provide
expertise

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#118:3:A>
Well even if you have the expertise are <unc> one-word
</unc> <.> indeed </.> technology you will still have to ask the Chinese
to let you in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#119:3:A>
So therefore we can cooperate together to go hand in hand to
protect our global environmental assets

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#120:3:A>
So <.> look here </.> today the USA says that they want to mend
the ozone layer the Brazil goes on threatening the whole world that they are
chopping up seventy five thousand hectares of forest every year

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#121:3:A>
So ladies and gentlemen we need the cooperation of all parties we
need all parties to sacrifice that is to pay

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#122:3:A>
Finally ladies and gentlemen if this motion is going to stand
today the scenario would be the developed countries pay for all environmental
protection

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#123:3:A>
In other words all the others are free free like a bird free from
any responsibility

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#124:3:A>
Our developed countries <?> will </?> pay for us

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#125:3:A>
So they don't have to pay anything

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#126:3:A>
It  ' s so sad

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#127:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen <,> <quote> heal the world make it a better
place for you and for me and the entire human race </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2A-032#128:3:A>
With this I thank you </I>
