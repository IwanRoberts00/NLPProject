Mr Deputy President <,,> the provision for capital expenditure
in the Nineteen Ninety-two to Ninety-three Estimates <,> is thirty-one
thousand seven hundred ninety million <,> twenty-five per cent of which has
been earmarked for the Airport Core Programme <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#2:1:A>
Will the government inform this council <,> what proportion of the
remaining seventy five per cent <,> that is twenty-three thousand eight
hundred forty million has been set aside for funding new capital works
projects to begin in the current financial year and what these projects are
<O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Treasury </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#3:1:A>
Mr Deputy President could this council be inform what actions
government will take to ensure that these new capital work projects can begin
as planned bearing in mind the zero growth in staffing in most of the works
departments <O> several-speeches </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#4:1:B>
Sir could the Secretary inform this council whether government
would co-operate with this council to help these poor ladies <,> if this
council agrees to set up an ad hoc group to consider the matter <O>
several-speeches </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#5:1:C>
Mr Deputy President will the Secretary for the Civil Service
please elaborate on specific measures which government will take <,> to
ensure that the necessary preparation and continuity will be achieved through
localisation in departments which have direct bearing on the upholding of the
rule of law <,> namely the Judiciary as has been mentioned but not so much on
the statistics but rather on than on <.> stra </.> strategy <,> the Legal
Department <,> and the law enforcement agencies and in particular the ICAC
and the police <O> several-speeches </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#6:1:D>
Mr Deputy President <,,> lack of statistics notwithstanding <,>
uh can the government confirm that if one were to look at the breakdown of
offices in the Civil Service in broadest sense in particular the agencies
mentioned by Honourable uh Mrs Selina Chow law enforcement police ICAC <,> uh
and judiciary that the breakdown would <.> wo </.> would not be as rosy as
painted in the previous uh part of the answer as high as sixty-five per cent

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#7:1:E>
Mr Deputy President <,> ships leaving Hong Kong have been
boarded <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#8:1:E>
Goods were seized

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#9:1:E>
This is tantamount to an act of piracy

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#10:1:E>
In the Secretary  ' s main answer part C he said <,> the ship owners
have been advised to make <.> representa </.> <.> tations </.> via their flag
state

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#11:1:E>
Sounds to me it  ' s like passing the buck

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#12:1:E>
Why are we not doing more to ensure <,> or and to safeguard ships
leaving Hong Kong <O> several-speeches </O>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#13:1:F>
Mr Deputy President <,> since the government has in the past
been unable <.> al </.> to allocate adequate resources <,> to implement
certain promised social welfare projects <,> will the administration inform
this council of the following

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#14:1:F>
A <,> what measures and steps will be taken in the future to ensure
that adequate provisions are made available for the timely implementation of
social welfare policies promulgated in the White Paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#15:1:F>
And B <,> how to ensure that the interim targets outlined in the
White Paper on Social Welfare into the Nineties and Beyond for various
services will be accomplished by nineteen ninety-five ninety-six as promised
<O> speech-by-Deputy-President </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#16:1:G>
Mr Deputy President <,,> I shall answer the two-part question
seriatim <,,> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#17:1:G>
As announced by the Governor in his address to this council <,> on
seventh of October <,> the current expenditure on social welfare will be
increased <,> by twenty-six per cent <,> in real terms between now <,> and
nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#18:1:G>
There will be an immediate capital injection <,> of two point three
billion dollars <,> into the Lotteries Fund for the secure funding of a major
improvement in our welfare services between now and nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#19:1:G>
This capital injection will ensure adequate provision for the
timely implementation of all the major social welfare targets <,> set out in
the White Paper on Social Welfare for the years from nineteen ninety-three
ninety-four to ninety-six ninety-seven <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#20:1:G>
This arrangement will not preclude government <,> from allocating
additional resources <,> for implementing other social welfare policies in
future <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#21:1:G>
Government will provide the necessary resources <,> to ensure that
the interim targets as outlined <,> in the White Paper on Social Welfare <,>
will be implemented as scheduled <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#22:1:G>
As mentioned earlier <,> funding has already been secured <,> for
meeting the key targets not only for the year nineteen ninety-five ninety-six
<,> but for the period up to ninety-six ninety-seven <O>
speech-by-Deputy-President </O>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#23:1:F>
Could the Secretary inform this council how projects <,> which
are not covered by the Social Welfare White Paper but have already been
approved by government <,> and have hitherto not been allocated funds for
their implementation <,> are to be funded <O> speech-by-Deputy-President <O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#24:1:G>
Mr Deputy President <,> the package announced this year in the
Governor  ' s policy address <,> will ensure <,> a twenty-six per cent increase
in real terms <,> in social welfare funding from now until ninety-six
ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#25:1:G>
The real increase for next year for example is seven point six per
cent <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#26:1:G>
Substantial amount of new money is thus assured every year in the
period <,> up to ninety-six ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#27:1:G>
The administration  ' s top priority is to meet key targets <,> in
the White Paper <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#28:1:G>
Funding for other improvement measures will be justified <,> and
funds will be sought <,> through the resource allocation exercise <,> in the
normal way <,> <O> several-speeches </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#29:1:G>
Mr Deputy President <,> uh indeed <,> the growth of
expenditure for next year does not only cater to two teams <,> of social
outreaching work <,> but an additional four outreaching social work teams for
next year <,> rising to a total of thirty teams <,> by ninety-five
ninety-four ninety-five <,> that is the entire White Paper target provision
<O> member's-question </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#30:1:G>
Mr Deputy President <,> I think time does not stand still <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#31:1:G>
The provision of social services will have to move with the times
if there is a genuine need to meet service uh in <.> pa </.> a particular
area <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#32:1:G>
The <,> provision of services in new towns for particular groups of
people will have to be reasoned <,> and if there is a genuine case <,> I will
seek the necessary advice from the necessary advisory committees before
implementing <O> member's-question </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#33:1:G>
Uh Mr Deputy uh President I think there is a slight
misunderstanding here

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#34:1:G>
In the past the Lotteries Fund was chiefly used for capital <,> uh
expenditure but the <,> special injection of funds of two point three billion
dollars into the Lotteries Fund <,> uh will be mainly used for recurrent <?>
with </?> associated capital expenditure <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#35:1:G>
I hope I have clarified that <O> speech-by-Deputy President </O>

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#36:1:H>
Uh Mr Deputy President <,> I think the Lotteries Fund
injection is a one-off capital injection <,> and against this one-off capital
injection is both the capital element and also uh uh uh element of uh
recurrent expenditure for a large number of uh uh increase in services

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#37:1:H>
There  ' s still some uncertainty involved in this capital injection
uh could take in account inflation and other costs that may be changing over
time <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#38:1:H>
Can the government uh inform this council whether it is uh
determined uh to consider other measure to boast the <.> capa </.> uh the
Lotteries Fund should it prove that it  ' s inadequate to meet the full targets
of the uh Social Welfare White Paper <O> Speech of the Deputy President </O>

<$G> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#39:1:G>
Uh Mr Deputy President <,,> the basis for the two point three
billion dollar injection into the Lotteries Fund includes one point six
billion for a new <.> s </.> direct services <,> and zero point seven billion
<,> for other services currently funded from general revenue <,> so as to
relieve funds to meet in part the social security payments <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#40:1:G>
The capital injection may appear indeed to be much higher <,> than
the increase in recurrent spending <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#41:1:G>
This is because the capital injection required has been derived on
the basis of assessed money of the day <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#42:1:G>
We anticipate that <,> when the funds are exhausted from the
Lotteries Fund <,> they will there will be capacity for the commitments to be
met <,> from the general revenue <O> several-speeches </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#43:1:D>
Mr Deputy President <,> in view of the changing international
practice mentioned in the answer <,> will the <.> Se </.> Secretary uh agree
that it will be desirable and will he undertake to see whether it is feasible
<,> to upgrade the standards for the Cross Harbour Tunnel to be in line with
the newer standards of a hundred and twenty-five parts per million <O>
speech-by-Secretary-for-Transport </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#44:1:A>
Mr Deputy President <,> in the second paragraph of his of his
reply the Secretary for Transport stated <,> that all ventilation system of
the tunnels were inspected regularly <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#45:1:A>
Are these inspection carry out by <.> rele </.> relevant government
department or independent agency <,>
#> And what action government will take to ensure that ventilation systems
are in good running condition <O> speech-by-Secretary-for-Transport </O>

<$I> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#46:1:I>
Deputy President paragraph two of the reply states that <,>
levels of carbon monoxide are monitored continuously in all tunnels

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#47:1:I>
It is known that carbon monoxide leaves the human system very very
slowly <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#48:1:I>
Would the Secretary for Transport inform this council <,> whether
<.> h </.> uh he has a uh can give a better indication of actual levels found
in the tunnels <,> and whether <.> pe </.> it is safe for people to travel in
and use the tunnels repeatedly in the course of a day such as uh in the case
of a bus driver <O> several-speeches </O> <&> Tape stops </&>

<$J> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#49:1:J>
<&> Some parts of recording missing </&> Secretary inform this
council whether the administration would encourage the bus companies to
operate only air-conditioned buses <,> on routes which pass through these
tunnels <,> so as to avoid the air quality problem <,> and at the same time
attract more people to use public transport instead of driving their own cars
<O> several-speeches </O>

<$K> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#50:1:K>
Thank you Mr Deputy President

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#51:1:K>
I must admit that I fail to uh understand the the reply because all
these are technical terms two hundred and fifty parts per per million during
any thirty minutes

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#52:1:K>
I want to ask a simple question <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#53:1:K>
Say if the air in this room has a content of carbon dioxide of two
hundred and <.> fi </.> fifty parts per million can we last for thirty
minutes sitting here <,,> without <?> conducting </?> any health problems <O>
several-speeches </O>

<$L> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-055#54:1:L>
Mr Deputy President <,> I move that the Amusement Game Centres
Bill be read the second time <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#55:1:L>
The bill introduced today seeks to establish a new scheme for
licensing amusement game centres <,> in order to provide better control over
these centres <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#56:1:L>
There are currently six hundred and forty-one licensed amusement
game centres <,> five hundred fourteen of which are adult centres <,> and one
hundred and twenty-seven children  ' s centres

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#57:1:L>
They are controlled by provisions under the Miscellaneous Licences
Ordinance <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#58:1:L>
Licence conditions are imposed on amusement game centre licensees
by the Commissioner of Television and Entertainment Licensing <,> under the
approval of the Governor in Council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#59:1:L>
In May nineteen ninety the Court of Appeal held that a special
licence condition <,> relating to age restrictions in amusement game centres
<,> was invalid because the condition was not made by way of regulation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#60:1:L>
The court considered that when the legislation provided for the
Governor in Council by regulation to make licence conditions <,> there was no
power to impose or to establish licence conditions by any other process <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#61:1:L>
This was so notwithstanding Regulation Nine of the Miscellaneous
Licences Regulations <,> which empower the Commissioner to impose special
licence conditions <,> under the approval of the Governor in council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#62:1:L>
As a result <,> only two out of eighteen licence conditions imposed
on amusement game centres licensees are valid <,> and they have been included
as regulations <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#63:1:L>
These two relate to the transfer of licences and the operating
hours of the centres <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#64:1:L>
All of the others sixteen special conditions were ruled to be ultra
vires and are thus unenforceable <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#65:1:L>
Due to the vires problem amusement game centres have increasingly
been operated in a manner which conflicts with the former licence conditions
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#66:1:L>
Consequently unapproved machines and games of an indecent nature
can be found in many centres <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#67:1:L>
Age limits are also ignored <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#68:1:L>
There has been public concern over these problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#69:1:L>
There is also a need for more effective and stricter control <,>
over amusement game centres <,> coupled with much tighter supervision of
licensees occasion by the rapid changes in games machine technology <,> and
the increasing complexity of the industry <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#70:1:L>
We have therefore decided to separate amusement game centres
licences <,> from the Miscellaneous Licences Ordinance <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#71:1:L>
The Amusement Game Centres Bill <,> will empower the Commissioner
for Television and Entertainment Licensing <,> to impose licence conditions
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#72:1:L>
In order to tackle the existing management problems evident in many
centres <,> the licence conditions will include a number of regulatory
provisions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#73:1:L>
Of greatest significance will be the conditions to prohibit the
installation of any game <,> which has not been approved by the Commissioner
<,> and bar entry to adult centres to people aged sixteen and above <,> as
well as to restrict entry to children  ' s centre to persons to the age of
sixteen only <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#74:1:L>
It will be an offence if the licensee contravenes any of the
licence conditions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#75:1:L>
To have a greater deterrent effect <,> the bill also provides that
the penalty on second or subsequent conviction <,> will be heavier than that
on first of conviction <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#76:1:L>
Under the Miscellaneous Licences Ordinance <,> the Commissioner was
empowered to revoke or refuse to renew a licence <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#77:1:L>
Warning letters were issued to the licensee to urge him to improve
the management <,> before revocation or non-renewal of a licence was
considered <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#78:1:L>
However many licensees simply ignored these letters <,> and showed
no improvement until they received a final warning <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#79:1:L>
To ensure the operators observe the license conditions
conscientiously <,> the Commissioner will be empowered to suspend <,> revoke
<,> or refuse to renew a license <,> under specified circumstances <,> if
license conditions are breached <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#80:1:L>
The suspension of a license <,> will serve as a serious warning <,>
that if there is no improvement in management <,> revocation of the license
will be considered <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#81:1:L>
Suspension and revocation of a license <,> are measures which
should go a long way to protect the interests of the public <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#82:1:L>
An independent Appeal Board will be set up to consider appeals <,>
arising from enforcement of the legislation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#83:1:L>
The Board will be chaired by a person qualified for appointment as
a District Judge <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-055#84:1:L>
The Bill contains provisions <,> to allow existing amusement games
centres  '  licenses granted under the Miscellaneous Licenses Ordinance to
continue to be valid <,> after the enactment of the new Bill </I>
