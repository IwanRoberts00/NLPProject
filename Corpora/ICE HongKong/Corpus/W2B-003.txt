<bold> Interpreting one hilarious journey </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#2:1>
The venerable tale of the Monkey King gets twisted in a startling
new production making its debut at the Arts Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#3:1>
<bold> Clarence Tsui </bold> joins the multi-national cast climbing a
Tower of Babel script - and enjoys the view </p> <O> Three photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#4:1>
<bold>  ' There  ' s more than one way to tackle <it> Journey to The
West </it> ,  '  says director Ko confidently . His retelling , entitled <it>
Goku </it> , sees Great Monk Tang trading in his horse for a tricycle , while
his foes threaten to serve him up for dinner as  ' sweet and sour monk ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#5:1>
Still , such eye-popping variations promises to detract little from
the well-known classic  ' s dramatic staging </bold> </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#6:1>
LO PUI-KWAN/ Hong Kong iMail <bold> Ko Tun-lung directs an
international cast , heavily armed with language dictionaries , on a hold
theatrical journey across the dauntingly wide &ldquo; River to Heaven &rdquo;
</bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#7:1>
<bold> A </bold> S theatre production go , staging <it> Goku </it>
might have turned into a cultural calamity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#8:1>
What could be more difficult than bringing together companies from
three difficult countries , speaking four distinct languages , to take part
in a plush period extravaganza , based on the legendary Chinese book <it>
Journey To The West </it> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#9:1>
Words such as &ldquo; nightmare scenario &rdquo; spring to mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#10:1>
But &ldquo; innovative &rdquo; might be closer to the mark when the
curtain foes up on <it> Goku </it> &obrack;  <it> Monkey King </it>  &cbrack; , at the Hong
Kong Arts Festival , which opens tonight . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#11:1>
In a clever piece of theatre , the Monkey King &obrack;  played by Jun
Sato from Japan &cbrack; fires off letters in Japanese , while his comrade , Pigsy &obrack; 
Hong Kong actor Lee Chun-chow &cbrack; , resorts in Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#12:1>
The Monk Sha &obrack;  Korea  ' s Shin Hyun Jong &cbrack; emits Korean battle-cries as
his evil nemesis , Monster &obrack;  played by Qi Jianguo from Beijing &cbrack; rebukes him
in Putonghua . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#13:1>
All this linguistic babble could have been the recipe for
artistic disaster .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#14:1>
The provision of English subtitles is one way to alleviate the
Bable-esque problems .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#15:1>
The stress on body movements and facial gestures is another .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#16:1>
But according to Ko Tin-lung , one of the associate directors of <it>
Goku </it> , the trick was to play down the language problems in the libretto .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#17:1>
&ldquo; They have to act as if they are hearing everyone speak in
their own language , and will react accordingly , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#18:1>
&ldquo; It was of utmost importance that the actors themselves
communicate as people during rehearsals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#19:1>
It  ' s important that the cast stand as one .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#20:1>
When the Great Monk Tang &obrack;  played by Yoichi Kobiyama &cbrack; says something
in Japanese , for example , Pigsy could naturally give a response in
Cantonese as if he was taking part in a normal conversation . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#21:1>
Apart from the talk of artistic solidarity , it helps that the
storyline of this classic Chinese fable is timeless .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#22:1>
<it> Journey To The West </it> is easily the most accessible and
well-known piece of Chinese literature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#23:1>
Every kid in Hong Kong probably knows about the adventures of the
Monkey King and his friends , how they crossed deserts and defeated evil
during their pilgrimage to &ldquo; the West" , the place where Great Monk
Tang would receive sacred Buddhist scriptures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#24:1>
By adapting the most straightforward chapter - how the group
crushes a child-eating devil while trying to cross the &ldquo;
400-kilometre-wide &rdquo; River to Heaven - the masterminds behind <it> Goku
</it> made sure nothing would be lost to linguistic differences . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#25:1>
Under the leadership of Japan  ' s Kageboushi Theatre Company - an
institution itself in children-oriented theatre - <it> Goku </it> promises to
deliever cosy entertainment with uncluttered philosophical subtexts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#26:1>
A remarkable feat considering the difficulties behind the grandiose
project , which has been in the works for two years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#27:1>
The first rehearsals were held last June , and the actors have
just finished an intensive six-week stint in Japan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#28:1>
The marathon session ended with two performances in Tokyo . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#29:1>
Obviously , the major headache was communication among the
production crew .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#30:1>
Even script readings became hilarious event .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#31:1>
&ldquo; All sorts of dictionaries were lying around when we were
delving into the text - that  ' s painfully funny , &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#32:1>
In addition , all the lines were individually numbered , so the
actors could keep track of the scenes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#33:1>
Briefing sessions by Japanese chief director Hitosho Uyama were tests
of endurance for the actors , Ko adds .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#34:1>
When Uyama finished a sentence , two interpreters immediately began
repeating his directives in Korean and Putonghua .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#35:1>
&ldquo; It was like being barracked by an endless stream of noise ,
&rdquo; Ko says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#36:1>
Yet despite this painful process , the Hong Kong contingent - all
from Chung Ying Theatre , one of the associate organizers along with the
Beijing Art Troupe for Children and Seoul  ' s Joyful Theatre - was delighted
to work with other groups . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#37:1>
There was also the chance to see how Japan and Korea interpret
Jou <it> rney To The West </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#38:1>
The Japanese , for example , have an infatuation with the Monkey King
- the perfect cartoon hero that served as a blueprint for the <it> manga
</it> hit <it> Dragonball </it> . Koreans , meanwhile , have a special
affection for Monk Sha: the way he prefers to work &obrack;  or fight &cbrack; rather than
talk resonates with the country .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#39:1>
Just as people have decided to instill <it> Journey To The West </it>
with new meanings , <it> Goku </it> will give the classic fable a modern
sheen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#40:1>
Leather pants and boots are in abundance , while Great Moon Tang will
ride a tricycle rather than a horse .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#41:1>
The language is also contemporary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#42:1>
Ko chuckles when the devils suggest that when they consume the
captured Great Monk , it will be like devouring &ldquo; Sweet and Sour Monk" .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#43:1>
While careful of the dangers of turning a literary classic into a
parody , Ko adds that <it> Goku </it> is &ldquo; primarily a comedy and the
emphasis to create a relaxed atmosphere that will make people laugh" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#44:1>
He adds: &ldquo; There  ' s not just one way to tackle <it> Journey To
The West </it> . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#45:1>
After saying that , chaotic , gag-friendly drama is hardly what
people expect for the annual high-art festival . In <it> Goku </it> , the
organizers have deliberately tried to widen the festival  ' s appeal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#46:1>
&ldquo; There has been a lack of family-oriented programmes in the
history of the Arts Festival - and in Hong Kong there hasn't been much that
is of high quality anyway , except some puppet show or <it> The Nutcracker
</it> during Christmas,: says Grace Lang , the festival  ' s programme director .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#47:1>
With their hearts set on making a &ldquo; family-oriented
programme with substance and quality" , Lang and her colleagues brought in
Kageboushi .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#48:1>
The Japanese theatre company had previously been involved in the
shawdowplay-and-puppet tale of Prince Kaguya in 1998 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#49:1>
Now the festival plans to make Goku a long-running spectacular .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#50:1>
The production will travel to Beijing , Shanghai , Singapore and
Seoul after its premiere in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#51:1>
&ldquo; Given the effort and resources being injected into it , it
would be a pity to have <it> Goku </it> only as a one-off performance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#52:1>
We hope it could have a lifespan of four to five years , &rdquo; says
Lang . </p>

Centre , from February 23 to 25 </bold> </it> </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#62:2>
The ups and downs , hit and misses of the BeeGees have amounted to a
compelling tale . <bold> Clarence Tsui </bold> chats with one of the singing
sibling , Maurice Gibb , and finds that the group  ' s famed harmony extends
beyond the music </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#63:2>
<bold> IT  ' s </bold> official: Maurice Gibb loves Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#64:2>
&ldquo; When I come here , I  ' m always treated well .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#65:2>
People are so respectful and so warm .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#66:2>
Very few cities are like that , &rdquo; says the 51-year-old member
of one of contemporary music  ' s most enduring sibling acts , the BeeGees .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#67:2>
Maurice was in town to receive a gold-record award for the Gibbs
brother  ' s album sales in Thailand and a plaque from Hong Kong for their
length career at pop  ' s pinnacle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#68:2>
Sitting in a plush suite at The Peninsula , surrounded by doting
publicists and glass cabinets filled with BeeGees memorabilia , Gibb - who
has been to the city seven times - doesn't try to hide his gratitude for Hong
Kong , which has always been there for comfort when the going sets though for
the trio . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#69:2>
During their wilderness years in the 1970s , when poor record
sales condemned them to club dates in northern England and their album , <it>
A Kick in the Head is Worth Eight in the Pants </it> , was unceremoniously
shelved , they were still regarded as gods here .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#70:2>
Their first visit , in 1972 , was met with pandemonium; hysterical
schoolgirls packed their Hong Kong Stadium concert . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#71:2>
&ldquo; Oh , that was a different period - that was what we call
our  ' dead zone ' - because from 1971 to 1974 , we had no label , no management
, nothing , &rdquo; Gibbs says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#72:2>
&ldquo; I think it was more of a rebellious time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#73:2>
It might as well have been our Spinal Tap period , &rdquo; he adds ,
alluding to the fictional grizzled rock band clinging to fame in a popular
1984 pseudo-documentary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#74:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s funny .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#75:2>
Every time we see the film , it reminds me of us , just like it told
out story . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#76:2>
Gibb can well laugh about it now .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#77:2>
Nearly four decades into their recording career , the BeeGees - Barry
Gibb , and twins Maurice and Robin - have perfected the art of the comeback ,
having found themselves at the end of a backlash once too often .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#78:2>
The BeeGees have never been a critic  ' s band: their adherence to
mainstream values has never been an endearing proposition for musical
trend-setters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#79:2>
Maurine may have a hard battle in his hands with the Gibb  ' s
latest album , <it> This is Where We Came In </it> , which repackages classic
sounds from different musical periods .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#80:2>
Some songs sound like the Fab Four - <it> Technicolour Dreams </it>
pays homage to Noel Coward  ' s ditties - while other selections are laden with
heavy guitar riffs from the 1970s .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#81:2>
An avant-garde electro-jazz record this surely isn't .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#82:2>
&ldquo; It represents really five decades of what we  ' ve been
influenced by .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#83:2>
The title track and <it> She Keeps On Coming </it> are pure Beatles -
in fact , I was playing John Lennon  ' s acoustic guitar , which he gave me for
my 21st birthday , on the tracks , &rdquo; Gibbs says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#84:2>
&ldquo; We also record it like we did in the late 1960s , around
one mike , balancing the harmonies within ourselves and recording it live ,
not unlike <it> You  ' re Gonna Lose That Girl </it> in &obrack;  the Beatles film]
<it> Help </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#85:2>
We just did it exactly as we used to do it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#86:2>
Gibb is confident about his credentials in braving new challenges
, citing his derring-do in the past . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#87:2>
&ldquo; I played the first synthesiser ever built , the mellotron
, which John Lennon had played on <it> Strawberry Fields </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#88:2>
When I got that , I got hooked - I got a piano that sounds different
, if you like . And if you listen to a song like <it> Words </it> , the piano
came with a big compression on it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#89:2>
And then I had the first Moog synthesiser with all the cables that
went everywhere , and they sent me the drum machines and things like that ,
so I know a lot this stuff .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#90:2>
The only thing I didn't like is the rubbish music that come out by
using them . &rdquo; </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#92:2>
<bold> Oh , those nights in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#93:2>
The BeeGees caused pandemonium every time they came to town .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#94:2>
Their first successful visit in 1972 was followed by a triumphant
return two years later , main picture .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#95:2>
Left to right , Maurice , Robin and Barry , hit the stage at Hong
Kong Stadium .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#96:2>
Teenage fans , left , couldn't decide whether to weep or grin when
Robin obliged with autographs </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#97:2>
Gibb describes <it> This is Where We Came In </it> as going back
to the basics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#98:2>
In fact , relating to their own past has always been problematic for
the BeeGees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#99:2>
People have always associated the trip with the cheesy aspects of pop
music , what with their ourve of saccharine ballads , vocal harmonies and
falsetto-driven disco music . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#100:2>
&ldquo; Some groups would die for a <it> Saturday Night Fever
</it> in their career - it  ' s just like Michael Jackson having <it> Thriller
</it> , &rdquo; Gibb counters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#101:2>
&ldquo; It was one of those thing that you didn't expect to happen
and it surprised everybody .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#102:2>
But we don't live in that period , you know .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#103:2>
We  ' re still moving on , but people still want to drag us back .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#104:2>
&ldquo; I don't have any regrets or anything like hat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#105:2>
Somebody recently said:  ' You guys ever thought about writing another
song like <it> Stayin ' Alive </it> ?  ' 

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#106:2>
We were like:  ' No , we  ' ve done it , we can't go back there. ' I mean
, sometimes the media expect us to walk on stage with bellbottom flares and
stuff .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#107:2>
I  ' d think ,  ' Didn't you start changing your style ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#108:2>
Would you walk out like that? ' &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#109:2>
For someone who has received more than his fair share of bad
press , Gibb cuts a surprisingly amiable figure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#110:2>
His self-confidence is often channelled through witty remarks and
animated facial expressions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#111:2>
Recalling how a journalist once suggested the BeeGees had given
birth to Boyzone , he says &ldquo; Somebody once said:  ' You were the original
boy band , weren't you?'

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#112:2>
What ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#113:2>
Because we  ' re all dressed in white , dancing away ? &obrack;  Feigns
Travolta  ' s pelvis-shaking moves from <it> Saturday Night Fever </it> .]

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#114:2>
No , I don't think so . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#115:2>
The BeeGees have never been about just pompous pop from pretty
faces .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#116:2>
Born on the Isle of Man , the Gibb brothers were hitmakers in
Australia , where they grew up , before returning to England in 1967 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#117:2>
Two years of success followed , with legendary folk-styled pop hits
like <it> To Love Somebody </it> , <it> Massachusetts </it> and <it> Words
</it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#118:2>
But dark years soon caught up with the erstwhile young upstarts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#119:2>
The lukewarm reception of <it> Odessa </it> , their ambitious ,
orchestral 1968 double album , signalled the BeeGees ' first &ldquo; demise" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#120:2>
They drifted apart , and by the time they regrouped in 1970 , the
momentum was lost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#121:2>
In 1975 , they returned to the limelight with <it> Main Course
</it> , and album that spawned hits like <it> Night On Broadway </it> and
<it> Live Talkin ' </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#122:2>
But it was their contribution to the soundtrack of <it> Saturday
Night Fever </it> that cemented their status in the pop annals , with numbers
like <it> Stayin ' Alive </it> , <it> Night Fever </it> and the ballad <it>
How Deep Is Your Love </it> ? . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#123:2>
The disco inferno proved to be a mixed blessing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#124:2>
When radio stations began having &ldquo; BeeGees-free weekends" ,
Gibb found it &ldquo; scary" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#125:2>
They did production work for artists such as Barbra Streisand
and Diana Ross before re-emerging with albums such as 1987  ' s <it> ESP </it>
( which gave them the UK-chart-topper <it> You Win Again </it>  &cbrack; and 1989's
<it> One </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#126:2>
Their release since then might not have set the charts on fire ,
but they did sell well as pop records go .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#127:2>
The poor performance of their early-1990s output was more than made
up for by <it> Still Waters </it> in 1997 , which provided a hit in the shape
of <it> Alone </it> , and then the live extravaganza <it> One Night Only
</it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#128:2>
Apart from their own album , the BeeGees have helped other
artists , such as Celine Dion , make hit records .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#129:2>
In fact , they could well life off royalties from chart-topping
cover versions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#130:2>
Gibb still remembers the most enthralling cover of a BeeGees
song ha has ever heard . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#131:2>
&ldquo; This guy put a tape on in the office and he said:  ' I  ' ve
found a new version of <it> Words </it> .'

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#132:2>
I was going:  ' OK ' - but it was Elvis .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#133:2>
And I was &obrack;  jaw dropping]... When those things happen , they are the
great moments in your life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#134:2>
I saw Elvisin Vegas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#135:2>
I went backstage and he just said &obrack;  imitating Elvis  ' s drawl &cbrack; ,  ' Hey
, how you doin'?'

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#136:2>
I said &obrack;  whimpering]:  ' Hi ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#137:2>
That was it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#138:2>
But next I got a phone call from Elvis -  ' I didn't know who you were
, I had no idea you were one of the Gibb brothers , you gotta come over and
have lunch ' . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#139:2>
But Gibb  ' s grin withers away when asked about the downside of
the past four decades . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#140:2>
&ldquo; I don't go there , I don't recycle old crap .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#141:2>
I  ' m reliving it for you - it  ' s just negative for me , you know ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#142:2>
Whatever was in a good period or a bad period , the fact that we  ' re
here to talk about it is a miracle in itself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-003#143:2>
We always think positively today . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-003#144:2>
After their break-up in the late 1960s , the alleged drug and
alcohol problems , and the death of their youngest brother , Andy , in 1988 ,
