<bold> New row over PAA official </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#2:1>
EXCLUSIVE by MARIANA WAN </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#3:1>
THE Provisional Airport Authority is to face questions this week
about the appointment of one of its leading executives , who left a previous
job amid allegations that he spent millions of US dollars without proper
authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#4:1>
Richard Judy , who holds two key positions at the PAA , was
alleged to have spent around US&dollar;32 million &obrack; HK&dollar;247
million &cbrack; on Miami International Airport related contracts without
full authorisation or seeking competitive bids during his time with Florida  ' s
Dade County Aviation Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#5:1>
Mr Judy resigned from his US&dollar;100,000-a-year position as
department director in 1989 , after 18 years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#6:1>
His departure came after one claim that he spent more than
US&dollar;300,000 without authorisation on feasibility studies for building a
motor-racing track . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#7:1>
The Hongkong revelations about Mr Judy sparked criticism from
pro-China Legislative Council and Airport Consultative Committee &obrack; ACC
&cbrack; members . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#8:1>
United Democrats airport projects spokesman Albert Chan Wai-yip
said he would call for Mr Judy  ' s resignation if the allegations made during
his time in the United States were found to be true . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#9:1>
Legislative Councillor Tam Yiu-chung claimed it appeared reckless
of the board if it had hired Mr Judy without thoroughly checking his
background . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#10:1>
He warned the incident could arouse suspicion on the Chinese side .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#11:1>
Pro-China ACC member Ho King-on said he would raise questions in
Thursday  ' s ACC meeting , when members are to be briefed on the PAA  ' s latest
funding request . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#12:1>
He said the PAA and its board would have difficulties explaining
themselves if they said they did not know of Mr Judy  ' s background . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#13:1>
&ldquo; It is hard to imagine how they will have no knowledge of
it ... this is ridiculous , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#14:1>
The revelations come at a difficult time for the PAA .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#15:1>
The authority is under fire from the United Democrats for alleged
abuse of entertainment and travel allowances , while the Government will this
week start to seek legislators  '  approval for a further &dollar;564 million
funding for the PAA . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#16:1>
The authority is still recovering from the controversial
departure of former chief executive Richard Allen , who left with a pay-off
of more than &dollar;5 million under as yet unexplained circumstances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#17:1>
Yesterday , the current PAA chief executive officer , Hank
Townsend , admitted he was &ldquo; not aware of the controversies &rdquo;
concerning Mr Judy during his tenure in Miami , adding he &ldquo; would not
imagine &rdquo; the PAA board would have any knowledge of them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#18:1>
&ldquo; How do you expect people in Hongkong , who are all busy
in Government or business , to be aware of allegations made in a newspaper in
Miami in the United States ?

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#19:1>
Why would you expect them &obrack; the PAA board &cbrack; to know
that ? &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#20:1>
Dr Townsend , who replaced Mr Allen as head of the PAA four
months ago , pledged to conduct an investigation into the allegations made
against Mr Judy during his time in Florida . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#21:1>
But he cautioned against &ldquo; waving allegations &rdquo; at Mr
Judy , who was recognised worldwide as an experienced airport executive ,
adding any possible action would only be taken after a thorough investigation
was carried out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#22:1>
He said since Mr Judy was hired by his predecessor , Mr Allen ,
he was unsure if the interim appointment had the board  ' s approval . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#23:1>
Mr Judy was hired by Mr Allen last October as the PAA  ' s interim
commercial director .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#24:1>
He is also interim operations director . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#25:1>
Mr Judy helped build the Miami airport into one of the world  ' s
biggest , but US legislators and local Miami newspapers grew increasingly
worried over his allegedly autocratic business style and lack of public
accountability .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#26:1>
He was known as &ldquo; the tsar of the airport &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#27:1>
During Mr Judy  ' s 18-year period as aviation boss in Miami ,
consulting contracts were alleged to have been &ldquo; funnelled &rdquo; to ,
among others , his or his key aides  '  friends and acquaintances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#28:1>
Mr Judy was never indicted on any criminal charges . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#29:1>
He was described as &ldquo; arrogant &rdquo; , &ldquo; too
unaccountable &rdquo; , and &ldquo; above questioning &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#30:1>
His critics claimed he ran the Miami Airport as his own personal <->
fifedom </-> <+> fiefdom </+> , answering to few people , if anyone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#31:1>
&ldquo; It seems that Mr Judy at times thinks he  ' s above
questioning by elected public officials , &rdquo; said a local elected
commissioner at the time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#32:1>
American legislators and the <it> Miami Herald </it> in 1989
conducted a series of investigations into Mr Judy  ' s business methods .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#33:1>
Mr Judy retired in the same year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#34:1>
Last week , Mr Judy told the <it> Sunday Morning Post </it> he
denied having &ldquo; misused &rdquo; funds or funnelled contracts to friends
, insisting &ldquo; not a single dime was misused &rdquo; during his time as
director . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#35:1>
He also said the commissioners , or US legislators , who raised
questions concerning him had since either been &ldquo; thrown out by the
voters &rdquo; or were &ldquo; under criminal investigation &rdquo;
themselves . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#36:1>
Mr Judy said : &rdquo; ... they wanted to compromise the
integrity of the business in that place .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#37:1>
I wouldn't have anything to do with it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#38:1>
He also claimed during his time in Miami he ran one of the most
&ldquo; economic and honest airports &rdquo; in the United States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#39:1>
Mr Judy said the <it> Miami Herald </it> had &ldquo; their own
axe to grind &rdquo; by running the articles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#40:1>
The <it> Herald  ' s </it> executive editor Doug Clifton said :
&ldquo; I can't even imagine what he is talking about .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#41:1>
It sounds like nonsense to me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#42:1>
&ldquo; We are a newspaper that takes a pretty aggressive
approach to the auditing function , and so we monitor the affairs of
government quite closely and expenditure of public money quite closely .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#43:1>
That  ' s the only motivation we have . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#44:1>
&ldquo; Our coverage of Mr Judy was long .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#45:1>
We reported some of his lavish ways over years ... decades .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#46:1>
We have no special interest in him per se , just in reporting that
public dollars are being spent . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#47:1>
One of the Miami commissioners closely involved in the case was
Larry Hawkins .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#48:1>
He told the <it> Sunday Morning Post </it> Mr Judy &ldquo; was asked
to leave &rdquo; because of disagreement with his manager over his management
style , &ldquo; as well as the allegations that were made against him &rdquo; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#49:1>
The newspaper  ' s series of articles on Mr Judy alleged , among
other things , money was funnelled through the airport  ' s engineering firm
via loopholes in two contracts signed with the firm in 1966 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#50:1>
It claimed that , by using the chief engineering firm &ldquo; as
a conduit to get the money to consultants &rdquo; , airport officials for 18
years had routinely bypassed a requirement to seek Metro Commission approval
for any consulting deal worth more than US&dollar;1,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#51:1>
Mr Judy also claimed questions were raised during his time in
office because &ldquo; everybody was there trying to make a buck ... and
commissioners came in with a huge campaign contribution that came from the
financial community keen to negotiate bonds &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#52:1>
He also denied having given contracts to friends , saying
everything was documented and properly accounted for . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#53:1>
He said his &ldquo; tsar of the airport &rdquo; reputation
&ldquo; came from those who had a special interest &rdquo; and would not want
to bid competitively for a contract . </p> </I>

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#56:2>
AN HIV-infected boy expelled from school two years ago is still
being taught by a tutor despite the pledges of education chiefs that he would
be found a place in a regular school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#57:2>
Last night the mother of Ming Tsai , 13 , said the situation had
driven her son to threaten suicide . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#58:2>
She said he told her on Thursday : &ldquo; I am no good .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#59:2>
I do not want to live .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#60:2>
I want to kill myself . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#61:2>
Ming Tsai  ' s well-publicised expulsion sparked a public outcry
followed by a pledge to help from Education Department officials last year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#62:2>
His tearful mother said yesterday : &ldquo; I do not know what to
do now .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#63:2>
He was in tears .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#64:2>
He said he did not want to give me more trouble . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#65:2>
&ldquo; It took me so long to calm him down .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#66:2>
It has never happened before , that he would talk about taking his
life . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#67:2>
She is unsure what has prompted Ming Tsai  ' s depression , but
suspects he is desperate to return to a normal school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#68:2>
&ldquo; He knew he had the AIDS virus .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#69:2>
He would cry to himself , but he has never talked about killing
himself .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#70:2>
My husband and I suspect he wants to have a normal school life .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#71:2>
Ming Tsai , a haemophiliac , was expelled from a Sha Tin school
when his headmaster learned of his condition , the result of receiving blood
contaminated by the virus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#72:2>
Although the Director of Education , Mr Dominic Wong Shing-wah ,
pledged in December he would help , the boy had yet to be placed in a school .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#73:2>
Ming Tsai is receiving special tutoring for a weekly total of
five hours provided by the department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#74:2>
But his mother said : &ldquo; That is so different from a normal
school setting .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#75:2>
He is studying with one other child .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#76:2>
He said he did not want to go back .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#77:2>
He said he wanted to go to a normal school . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#78:2>
The mother said another possible cause of Ming Tsai  ' s depression
could be that the boy had received unwarranted pressure from his teacher .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#79:2>
She said the teacher could have suspected he was HIV-infected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#80:2>
&ldquo; The teacher asked him where he lived and which school his
brother went to .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#81:2>
She might be trying to confirm her suspicions .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#82:2>
I am afraid that could have hurt his feelings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#83:2>
&ldquo; my husband and I do not want to send him back there .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#84:2>
If the Education Department cannot find him a normal school we will
ask a relative to give him private tutoring . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#85:2>
The mother said she last heard from the Education Department last
month when officials offered Ming Tsai a school place in Tai Po or Kowloon .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#86:2>
&ldquo; I told the officials it would be too far away .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#87:2>
He is an ill child and I still have his eight-year-old brother to
look after .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#88:2>
Transportation will be a big problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#89:2>
&ldquo; The official said it would be difficult to find him a
place in Sha Tin after all the publicity .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#90:2>
Other Sha Tin headmasters know about him .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#91:2>
The official only promised to try again . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#92:2>
Another mother whose HIV-infected son had also been deprived of a
normal education said : &ldquo; I don't understand why the Education
Department still cannot find him a place after all this time . Have they
really tried? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#93:2>
An Education Department official would not discuss the case ,
quoting confidentiality as the reason . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#94:2>
He said parents unhappy with their services , or those with
suicidal children , should contact his office or educational psychologists
directly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#95:2>
Asked whether there was a lack of confidence in officials among
parents , he said : &ldquo; Whether they have confidence or not is a personal
view .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#96:2>
We will provide our best service . </p> </I>

<bold> Scanner purchase uncertain </bold> </h> <h>

A Plan to buy a mobile CT scanner for use when antiquated
scanners in public hospitals break down hangs in the balance following
revelations the machine can be easily damaged on the road . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#100:3>
Consultant neurosurgeon at the Kwong Wah Hospital Dr John Kwok
Ching-kwong , who initiated the plan , last week said he &ldquo; disappointed
&rdquo; by the news . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#101:3>
Dr Kwok fears delay in the search for alternative scanner may
cause patients with severe head injuries to suffer further , and increase
disability rates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#102:3>
The move followed a <it> Sunday Morning Post </it> report that
patients are suffering as services are stretched to the limit by outdated
equipment , and that the only CT scanner at the Prince Wales Hospital may
break down for good . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#103:3>
Dr Kwok said the fact the plan might fail had sparked a separate
search for a mobile Magnetic Resonance Imaging &obrack; MRI &cbrack; scanner
, while more information was gathered on the mobile CT &obrack; Computerised
Tomography &cbrack; scanner . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#104:3>
&ldquo; It is a more sophisticated machine which can be an
alternative to the CT scanner , although it will be more expensive, &rdquo;
said Dr Kwok . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#105:3>
After he approached four suppliers of medical equipment , Dr
Kwok was told the CT scanner , which would cost &dollar;10 million to install
, could be damaged if shuttled from one hospital to another in an emergency .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#106:3>
He said it would produce blurred images of damaged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#107:3>
The MRI scanner would create fewer problems when transported ,
Dr Kwok said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-012#108:3>
Because the machine was not yet available in public hospitals , he
said it would be more sensible to invest in it although it would cost the
Hospital Authority an additional &dollar;5 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#109:3>
Meanwhile , Dr Kwok also said the manpower shortage in
neurosurgery services &dash; only 12 doctors cater to six million people
&dash; could worsen because of the 1997 issue . </p> </I>

Does 50-year-old Lau Hon-man really look 20 years younger in his
election campaign poster ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#113:4>
The portrait has drawn an accusation that Mr Lau had chosen a
decade-old picture of himself in a hope of appealing to voters in next month  ' s
election in the Lee On constituency in Kwun Tong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#114:4>
A community organisation in Kwun Tong complained that some
candidates had used old portraits for their posters and leaflets to mislead
voters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#115:4>
In an open letter to the Registration and Electoral Office ,
Shun Lee Community Development Association said some candidates looked 20
years younger . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#116:4>
&ldquo; Hair colour , countenance , complexion , wrinkles and
other features are very different from their real persons, &rdquo; the
association  ' s Acting Secretary Thomas Cheng Tze-yau said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#117:4>
Although Mr Cheng declined to name my candidates , it is
understood one such was the youthful-looking Mr Lau . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#118:4>
Mr Lau said the accusation was groundless because the portrait
he used was taken in April this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#119:4>
He said he would not bother finding out why anyone would try to
attack his integrity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#120:4>
The association is seen as one of the major supporters of Mr Lau  ' s
opponent Choy Chak-hung . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#121:4>
Mr Choy said the portrait of Mr Lau did not look like someone
else , but he had heard that a <it> <indig> kaifong </indig> </it> &obrack;
neighbour &cbrack; thought Mr Lau looked rather young on his poster . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#122:4>
He declined to comment further because Mr Lau would be running
against him . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#123:4>
A spokesman for the Registration and Electoral Office said
candidates were required to use &ldquo; recent &rdquo; photographs for their
election material . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-012#124:4>
However , the regulation does not specify what period was
considered recent . </p> </I>
