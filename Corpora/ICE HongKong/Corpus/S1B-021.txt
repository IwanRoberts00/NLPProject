Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X2:1:Z>
I  ' m Sally Blyth and with me as usual is political commentator T L
Tsim

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X3:1:Z>
This week Newsline looks at the implication of China  ' s move to
sack one of the few liberals as to appointed to become a Hong Kong affairs
advisor

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X4:1:Z>
No less than twelve Chinese newspapers this week condemn Beijing  ' s
decision to withdraw its invitation to Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X5:1:Z>
Many commentators believe that it was Meeting Point  ' s merger with
Martin Lee  ' s political party United Democrats which was the real motive
behind the decision to cancel Mr Cheung  ' s appointment

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X6:1:Z>
UDHK are considered hostile and subversive by Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X7:1:Z>
If China feel they cannot tolerate hearing the views from
dissenting voices now what are the implications of this after nineteen ninety
seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X8:1:Z>
Joining us on the programme is Anthony Cheung

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X9:1:Z>
We also have the leader of the other pro-democracy party in Hong
Kong Frederick Fung from Association of Democracy and People  ' s Livelihood

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X10:1:Z>
Good evening to you both </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#11:1:A>
Good evening

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X12:1:Z>
Uhm perhaps if I could start first of all with you <{1> <[1> Mr
</[1> Cheung and what are the reasons which China gave you for suddenly
withdrawing your <{2> <[2> appointment </[2> as an advisor </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#13:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#14:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#15:1:A>
Well they gave only one official reason <,> which was that uh they
initially appointed me in my own personal capacity

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#16:1:A>
But subsequently they knew that uh should the new party I mean the
future democratic party decide uh not to support my role as a Hong Kong
affairs advisor then I would withdraw

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#17:1:A>
But I told the Chinese officials very clearly that even uh in
January when they uh invite me to become an advisor

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#18:1:A>
I  ' ve told them that uh I would only accept the invitation with the
agreement of my own party which is Meeting Point

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#19:1:A>
Because I  ' m chairman of Meeting Point there  ' s no question that I
can accept the invitation uh purely in my own personal capacity

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#20:1:A>
And they knew about that

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#21:1:A>
So I said well if the same principle which will apply in a new
democratic party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#22:1:A>
But uh they said well for Meeting Point they know us they
understand what we  ' re doing but for a new party they  ' ve no knowledge no
idea

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#23:1:A>
So I guess my uh the cancellation of my appointment definitely has
something to do with the fact that I  ' m <,> uh participating in launching the
new party

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X24:1:Z>
Isn't China  ' s argument fair though that it is a new party they
know nothing about the new party <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X25:1:Z>
And you almost deliberately misled China by accepting the
appointment <,> without ever letting on that you  ' re in negotiation with UDHK
at that time about merging your party with UDHK </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#26:1:A>
I don't think <?> that </?> there  ' s any question of
misleading anyone

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#27:1:A>
Because uh early in this year when China invited me to become an
advisor we  ' ve not yet started <,> uh discussing with UDHK about the possible
uh launching of the new party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#28:1:A>
Uh <,> so uh I mean that that took uh a bit of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#29:1:A>
But in any case I don't think as a matter of principle uh we should
have to get China  ' s <?> blessing </?> for whatever thing we are doing in
Hong Kong

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#30:1:B>
Mr Fung you are still a member of the Hong Kong advisors
group <{> <[> <,> and </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#31:1:C>
<[> I think so </[> </{> because I  ' ve not yet accepted <{>
<[> the </[> the invitation uh uh paper uh somewhat like that

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#32:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#33:1:B>
You you have not <{> <[> been </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#34:1:C>
<[> Because </[> </{> you got the ceremony will hold hold <,>
will be hold on <,> twenty fifth uh this month

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#35:1:B>
Yes yes and you have not received any <{1> <[1> communication
</[1> uh which says your services are no longer required

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#36:1:B>
<{2> <[2> So we </[2> assuming you  ' re still a member of the Hong
Kong <{3> <[3> advisors group </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#37:1:B>
Now <,> your party of course also wanted a merger with the other
democratic parties <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#38:1:B>
Uh fortunately for your party uh this application uh was turned
down <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#39:1:B>
Now uhm do you still want to seek an alliance with the United
Democrat and Meeting Point after what  ' s happen to Mr Cheung

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#40:1:C>
<[1> Not not yet </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#41:1:C>
<[2> No not </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#42:1:C>
<[3> Okay yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#43:1:C>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#44:1:C>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#45:1:C>
Uh I think we did mention uh to Mr Cheung and Martin Lee that uh
we did have uh held a general meeting uh emergency meet general meeting uh
about ten days ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#46:1:C>
Uh we raise uh three points <,> see whether the new party accept
our three points or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#47:1:C>
If they uh they accepted I I think we have no doubt that we would
like to join it

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#48:1:B>
And you are prepared to take the risk that China may now
cancel your appointment

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#49:1:C>
Actually uh uh when we discuss about whether we should join it
or not <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#50:1:C>
We prepare <,> we prepare anything that may happen at that time <,>
not now

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#51:1:B>
So the the application still stands but you have those three
conditions

<$C> <  
 

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#52:1:C>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X53:1:Z>
Don't you think your credibility <?> thoughs </?> a Hong Kong
advisor is now on the line

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X54:1:Z>
<{> <[> Since </[> China obviously <,> not wanting to hear any
views which it doesn't want to hear in order words Mr Cheung has now not be
included as one of the Hong Kong advisors </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#55:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#56:1:C>
Uh I think I I I also told uh China clearly when they in uh <,>
invite me to to be advisor whether me whether I accept it or nor

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#57:1:C>
I did told them that I <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#58:1:C>
Even though they insist that their their invitation is <.> indi
</.> by individual <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#59:1:C>
Uh my acceptance will have the agreement with the ADPL

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#60:1:C>
If they do not agree <,> I will I will I won't I won't accept that

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#61:1:C>
And so uhm as to me I think <,> uh I will <,> discuss with them
anything that the ADPL uh <.> agr </.> ADPL agree me to talk or discuss with
them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X62:1:Z>
Now you  ' re going to be prepared to be as outspoken as you might
<,> wanted to be in the light of what has happen this week </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#63:1:C>
Uh I don't think we we need to change our attitude

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#64:1:B>
Mr Cheung <{> <[> uh </[> have you considered the possibility
at all of uhm <,> detaching Meeting Point from the United Democrat again so
as to enable you to serve

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#65:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#66:1:A>
No I don't think that is uh uh any any question we will consider

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#67:1:A>
Because uh <,> when when we discuss with UDHK about the possible
launching of a new party of the two groups

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#68:1:A>
Uh we have not taken uh the Hong Kong affairs affairs advisor <,>
issue into consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#69:1:A>
We don't think that is a uh part of our consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#70:1:A>
Uh <,> we took a very careful <,> and uh we think a very uh
important step forward by agreeing uh to launching new party on the basis of
Meeting Point and UDHK

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#71:1:A>
I think that is <,> uh in the best interest of the democratic camp
in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#72:1:A>
And also by doing so we are are preparing to uh uh be very
committed to Hong Kong in the long run

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#73:1:A>
I think this is uh uh we  ' re on the right path and I don't think uh
we should change our timetable or our direction simply because China has done
uh uh <?> there  ' s </?> about my appointment as <,> advisor

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#74:1:B>
If for the hell of it uhm Meeting Point and <{1> <[1> United
</[1> Democrats finally decide to include ADLP into their camp then you you
would have <,> the pressure of seeing Mr Fung either be excluded or China
having to bite the bullet and <{2> <[2> and take </[2> him as he is

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#75:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#76:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#77:1:A>
Well I think I must make one thing uh clear here

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#78:1:A>
Uh <,> and no time have <,> either Meeting Point or UDHK said that
we are excluding ADPL from this new democratic party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#79:1:A>
Indeed we are <,> welcoming anyone <,> uh apart from Meeting Point
members and UDHK members from join uh joining the new democratic party as
founding members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#80:1:A>
Uh the only thing being that uh as far as the launching
organization <,> is concerned

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#81:1:A>
There  ' re two Meeting Point and UDHK the two uh parties in our
general meetings have decided that we should keep the launching part uh
launching organizations <,> uh to only Meeting Point and UDHK

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#82:1:A>
But as far as membership is concerned it  ' s entirely open

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X83:1:Z>
But that  ' s they can only join on an individual basis <{> <[> not
as you say </[> as an umbrella group as the ADPL </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#84:1:A>
<[> Well it <,> uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#85:1:A>
The new party has not uh uh uh <.> fed </.> a federated party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#86:1:A>
I mean even Meeting Point members and UDHK members they join a new
party in their individual capacity as founding members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#87:1:A>
I mean that that that is the same treatment to be extended to uh
non-Meeting Point and non-UDHK members

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X88:1:Z>
Why don't you want Mr Fung  ' s <{> <[> group </[> as uh part of
the foundering members </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#89:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#90:1:A>
Well I mean uh this is a new party which is open to anyone who is
committed to the manifesto of a new party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#91:1:A>
Uh so obviously we want to see people apart from Meeting Point and
UDHK members to be founding members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#92:1:A>
Uh <,> we have not uh we have decided not to include ADPL as one of
the launching organizations

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#93:1:A>
I think that is based on the decision of our general meetings

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#94:1:A>
I mean uh uh it cannot be denied that among the membership I mean
there are views uh which <,> are are not too positive about <?> you </?> ADPL
but anyway I think that is a separate issue

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#95:1:B>
Would these views or <{> <[> objections </[> have something to
do with ADPL  ' s attitude towards the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#96:1:B>
Uhm some of the leaders of ADPL <,> uh itself and some of the the
uh stance they have taken

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#97:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#98:1:A>
Well there <,> were various views express within uh uh the
membership

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#99:1:A>
I think these views were particularly uh stronger I would say uh
among ADP uh UDHK members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#100:1:A>
But we have managed to <.> sec </.> secure the membership  ' s
support that ADPL members <,> I mean they they they can join the uh new party
as founding members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#101:1:A>
And as founding members they have the same rights and obligations
of course as other members founding members including members from <,>
Meeting Point and UDHK

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X102:1:Z>
Mr Fung do you accept this </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#103:1:C>
I think there is difference you know uhm <,> the first point
is that uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#104:1:C>
If we join it individually it should it I I think there may be I
don't know whether is there <{1> <[1> any machinery that is </[1> it you we
have a hundred and twenty uh members <{2> <[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#105:1:C>
Is it </[2> a hundred and twenty member will be accepted <{3> <[3>
<,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#106:1:C>
Or you will screen them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#107:1:C>
Uh <.> sec </.> <?> third </?> secondly is <.> af </.> after you
are uh the the forming process it means that <,> we are we are what we could
do is we accept whole of <,> of the <,> the decision you <{4> <[4> you </[4>
you decided in in October

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#108:1:C>
Or <,> if you you have some different ideas or some points then we
we can't we can't change it or you <{5> <[5> you </[5> can't raise our <,> uh
objection or other ideas

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#109:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm <,> uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#110:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#111:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#112:1:B>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#113:1:B>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#114:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X115:1:Z>
Mr Fung you  ' ve been accused actually of being a political
opportunist for blowing with the wind

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X116:1:Z>
And now you can see that the threat of a new large big
pro-democracy <{> <[> party </[> is actually going to threaten your own
organization your election chances in the future

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X117:1:Z>
Is this the only reason now why you want to join a new party </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#118:1:C>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#119:1:C>
I I I don't accept the the comment because uh <,> as our our
association  ' s direction towards China we did say that we want to <,> uh have
<?> try </?> to communicate with them

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#120:1:C>
On those things we do not accepted we will struggle with them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#121:1:C>
Uh of course somebody or the uh as uh Hong Kong will be some some
people thinking that uh you either stand against China or you support it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#122:1:C>
But we are it seem that our our strategies may not be uh <,>
accepted by the the the people or by the by the mass media

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#123:1:B>
But it it is true isn't it that China regards your party as
the the the less subversive the least subversive of the three let us say <{1>
<[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#124:1:B>
Uhm </[1> that is not necessarily good for you in a <{2> <[2>
general election yeah </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#125:1:B>
So you will have to come to terms with that or try to change tack
along the way

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#126:1:C>
<[1> Yeah uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#127:1:C>
<[2> Yeah <,> agreed </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#128:1:C>
I think uh as uh our our direction or strategy if you think that
uh China is the central government of <,> of the SAR in the coming future I
don't think we should cut all the channels

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#129:1:B>
But you you are in a very difficult <{> <[> position </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#130:1:C>
<[> I </[> </{> know

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#131:1:B>
You have a United <{> <[> Democrats </[> Meeting Point
alliance on the one hand then you have the DAB on the other

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#132:1:B>
And there is uhm very little room for you to manoeuvre

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#133:1:B>
You you have to you know join <,> the <,> the largest party in
Hong Kong which is going to be democratic party and run election on that
basis or be squeezed out

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#134:1:C>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#135:1:C>
Uh I think the whether we join it or not join it <?> e e </?> is
not the <,> the uh <,> the crucial crucial moment for us you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#136:1:C>
Because uh as what our uh usual daily works uh <,> you know our
candidates of the District Broad of the uh Urban Council they did work with
the <,> uh residents in their constituencies for years

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#137:1:C>
I think they know them well <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#138:1:C>
<unc> one-word </unc> for the uh legislative uh election
concern I think no matter we join the uh new party or not I don't think other
than K K Fung there will be more <,> than one candidate will be elected

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X139:1:Z>
Well <{> <[> we just </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#140:1:C>
<[> So that </[> </{> join or not join is <,> quite the same

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X141:1:Z>
Well we  ' ll continue this discussion <{> <[> in just a </[> few
minutes if we could just take a break there

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X142:1:Z>
Do join us again we  ' ll be back </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#143:1:C>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#144:1:C>
Uhm <&> A break </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X145:1:Z>
Welcome back to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X146:1:Z>
In the programme this week we  ' re discussing the future of the
pro-democracy political parties in Hong Kong and their relationship with
Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X147:1:Z>
We  ' re joined by Anthony Cheung from the newly created Democratic
Party and Fredrick Fung whose own party has been excluded from the new
political group

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X148:1:Z>
Mr Cheung has been dumped as an advisor to China because of its
involvement with the new party leaving Mr Fung as the only pro-democracy
activist in Beijing advisory ranks

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X149:1:Z>
Uhm and we  ' re just discussing at the end of that uh <{1> <[1>
first </[1> part uh your bid to try and join this new democratic party which
is being rejected <{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X150:1:Z>
Uhm </[2> why is it that you want to join a party when on a lot
of issues you  ' ve actually in the past disagree with both UDHK and Meeting
Point stance </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#151:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#152:1:C>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#153:1:C>
Uh I don't think so

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#154:1:C>
Even though some point some points we are disagree with each each
other but it  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#155:1:C>
Most of them most of them are not <,> uh disagreement in principle

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#156:1:C>
But <unc> two-words </unc> some some sometimes always the
strategies or tactics

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#157:1:C>
But uh you know I think we are quite closely with the Meeting
Point on the direction <?> toward </?> China

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#158:1:C>
Uh so when I I see that there there  ' s a <?> merge </?> merger
between uh Meeting Point and UDHK I think <,> uh if Meeting Point haven't
changed their direction

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#159:1:C>
It means that <,> the UDHK may change their direction towards
China

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#160:1:C>
And I would like to see that direction you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#161:1:C>
So you think that <,> there shouldn't any conflict then

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#162:1:B>
But <{> <[> but <unc> one-word </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#X163:1:Z>
<[> Mr Cheung </[> </{> is that something you agree with </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-021#164:1:A>
Well I think it  ' s uhm <,> too simplistic to say that uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#165:1:A>
I mean Meeting Point  ' s direction towards China different from
UDHK  ' s direction because I I don't think UDHK would agree with that

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#166:1:A>
But of course I mean our style may may differ in in handling the
relationship

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#167:1:A>
But can I come back to the point about uh accepting ADPL members
as founding members of a new democratic party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#168:1:A>
Indeed we are extending invitation to uh members <,> outside
Meeting Point and UDHK to become funding members

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#169:1:A>
We have done the same to ADPL and we have done the same <,> uh to
uh the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#170:1:A>
And indeed for the Foundation they have not found uh uh <.> pro
</.> problem by not be uh being one of the launching organizations

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#171:1:A>
They are quite happy to encourage the members to join the new
party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#172:1:A>
Uh there  ' s going to be a procedure whereby uh people can apply to
become uh foundering members of the new party and so long as they are
committed <,> to the uh beliefs and manifesto of a new party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#173:1:A>
I think that should be this the sole criteria

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#174:1:A>
But of course we have noticed from newspapers that a couple of
ADPL members they have uh I think a bit of <?> hesitation </?> about the new
party

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#175:1:A>
I mean they have suggested that uh the uh approach I mean Meeting
Point  ' s stance on the political reform in Hong Kong and also UDHK  ' s stance
on political reform

<ICE-HK:S1B-021#176:1:A>
They <,> found it a bit difficult to accept and they suggested
that uh uh uh we are sort of puppets of the American and the British </I>
