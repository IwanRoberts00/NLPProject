<ICE-HK:W1B-022#59:3>
It certainly is a very enjoyable and useful gathering .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#60:3>
I have gained a lot in understanding more on SAG visions and

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#61:3>
I have also gained a good insight of French dinners and entertainment .

Dear Volker ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#79:4>
It has been a great pleasure to see you again in Strasbourg .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#80:4>
Your hospitality and thoughtful arrangement during the exposition
have been excellent and I must sincerely thank you and all in Software AG who
have made my visit very enjoyable and memorable .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#81:4>
Please also convey my thanks to Mr. Holger . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#82:4>
It has been very valuable for me to learn of the various
development in SAG .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#83:4>
I understand from Mr. Frankie Sum that similar
presentations/demonstrations will also be arranged in Hong Kong , which will
be extremely useful .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#84:4>
So far we have been concentrating on the support issues and I
appreciate very much your awareness of our problems here in Hong Kong and
your assistance in this aspect .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#85:4>
I am sure I can expect the same level of support from you ,
especially when we are cutting over COSAC 2 on 17 July 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#86:4>
As we discussed in Strasbourg , I can confirm that a review of a
number of COSAC 2 issues will be required and I suggest that it takes place
middle of June , say 13 June 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#87:4>
Two issues are currently in mind :

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#88:4>
backup and disaster recovery , with the appropriate system
administrative tasks

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#89:4>
performance monitoring and tuning </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#90:4>
Please advise if this is okay and your estimate of time/cost .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#91:4>
Should I arrange this with the local SAG office ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#92:4>
Yours faithfully ,

Thanks a lot for your offer of assistance to us in tuning COSAC
2 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#133:6>
I am very happy to accept the consulting service of Mr. Stephen
Tam as suggested .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#134:6>
I believe he can contribute a lot during his 5 days assignment
starting 25 July 1994 , I expect that some tuning would have been completed
by the end of the assignment .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#135:6>
We are discussing with him on what will be the best way for him to
help us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#136:6>
Mr. Rafi Ezratti will also be a great help .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#137:6>
I think that his assistance may be of a longer term basis and may
not contribute to our requirement of tuning the system so that it can be
implemented in the immediate near future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#138:6>
I suggest that we discuss that after the heat of COSAC 2
implementation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#139:6>
Once again I thank you for your care and interest in ensuring
COSAC 2 implementation a success .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#140:6>
I am very certain that the choice of service from SPL/SAG is a very
good and correct one . </p>

<ul> COSAC 2 Implementation </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#164:7>
After the long series of tests and re-tests and trying out
various options and performance , we now have a plan to implement COSAC 2 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#165:7>
I would like to keep you up-to-date with the plan and appreciate
if you can examine it in detail and advise if you see any doubts and flaws .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#166:7>
I am sure our friends in Germany will be happy to help . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#167:7>
I enclose the hardware and software configuration for your
scrutiny .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#168:7>
We plan to convert phase 1 overnight on Thursday &obrack; 4 August
1994 &cbrack; and hopefully bring up COSAC 2 in the morning of Friday
&obrack; 5 August 1994 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#169:7>
You will notice that we will use the UNIX NATURAL version
2.1.2.6 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#170:7>
We have been using this version for two smaller production systems
for a while and feel that most of the discrepancies between versions 2.1.2.6.
and 2.1.2.5 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#171:7>
&obrack; on which COSAC 2 program are developed &cbrack; are known .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#172:7>
We have currently no confidence in using version 2.1.2.9. now as
we have not yet been able to run it on the IBM RS6000/990 machine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#173:7>
So far we have identified one discrepancy which will require 35
application programs to be changed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#174:7>
Without a detail testing , we are not sure whether there are other
compatibility problems and surprises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#175:7>
If you see any potential problems with version 2.1.2.6. , please
advise us soonest so that we can adjust , if possible . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#176:7>
Again , I will stress on the importance of on-site technical
support during the first few days of implementation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#177:7>
We will need someone to look at the problem , provide very quick
answers and suggestions if problems crop up during the cutover and I would
hope that experts from Germany or other places &obrack; such as Mr. Frank
Zaknic from Australia &cbrack; can help us .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#178:7>
Please confirm your support plan soonest . </p>

<ul> COSAC 2 Phase I Implementation </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#201:8>
We have finally cut over COSAC 2 phase I last Friday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#202:8>
Thanks to you and all the support staff in Germany and in Hong Kong
who have help a lot in making this possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#203:8>
Please convey my thanks to them , especially Yalcin , Uwa , Holger
in Germany , Frankie from Australia , Phesany , Rob and Frankie from Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#204:8>
We have quite a few problems during cut over .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#205:8>
Most of them relate to conversion and application software .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#206:8>
Software AG products seem to work fine , with only a few minor
problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#207:8>
There is however some aspects which we would like your
assistance .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#208:8>
There are some parameters which we feel are set to very high values .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#209:8>
As currently we have about 60 log on users in phase I , I have a
little concern on how much higher they can be when we have 300 users , e.g.
the number of domains in Net-work Access .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#210:8>
I attach some descriptions of these for your information and
checking . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#211:8>
I am also hoping to use the ADABAS version 2.1.5 as soon as
possible and hope that you can advise me immediately when it is available .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#233:9>
<ul> TRAXON/COSAC 2 Link </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#234:9>
COSAC 2 will be implemented in July 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#235:9>
To achieve a smooth cut-over , we are considering a phase-in
implementation approach .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#236:9>
This approach will take about three weeks , and will be implemented
in three phases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#237:9>
In the first phase , COSAC 2 will process cargo information for
a small number of airlines .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#238:9>
All cargo information processing for the rest of the airlines
community will be done through COSAC 1 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#239:9>
During the second phase , all airlines being handled in Terminal 2
will be cut-over to COSAC 2 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#240:9>
The third and the final phase will see all airlines being processed
through COSAC 2 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#241:9>
We have discussed in detail with your Mr. Cranford Yu on the
impact and opportunities for Traxon and the resulting from the COSAC 2
implementation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#242:9>
Your assistance and support will contribute greatly to the success
of this phase-in approach .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#243:9>
We therefore request your help in maintaining two separate Traxon
links on COSAC 1 and COSAC 2 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#244:9>
The COSAC 1 link is the existing screen/SNA linkage .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#245:9>
The new COSAC 2 link <?> uses </?> the TCP/X25 link , with message
passing techniques .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#246:9>
Traxon users can use different Traxon screens screens to inquire
both COSAC 1 and 2 information .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#247:9>
Error message modules , for both links , would be prepared by HACTL
to prompt Traxon users to use the appropriate link . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#248:9>
Please confirm if this arrangement is acceptable to you . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#249:9>
Yours sincerely ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#250:9>

Dear Mr. Parayil ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#258:10>
This refers to your letter of 26th September 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#259:10>
I have to apologize for the delay of this reply as I had been very
busy in organizing a workshop which took place last weekend . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#260:10>
There is an unwritten house rule in Hong Kong Arts Centre to
reserve two house seats in the Shouson Theatre and Lim Por Yen Theatre for
any Hong Kong Arts Centre presentation or film screening to cater for
protocol or unexpected needs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#261:10>
The duty Manager has the authority to release these seats right
before the show .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#262:10>
The Box Office usually will let all the patrons to mark down their
names on the waiting list , once the Duty Manager releases the house seats ,
the names on the list will be announced in order . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#263:10>
In investigating the incident stated in your said letter , the
Duty Manager released the house seats at around 5:30 p.m. on that day and
the box office assistant sold those seats on a first come first serve basis .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#264:10>
As all tickets for that <-> sceening </-> <+> screening </+> were sold out , I believe the other vacant seats were present as a result of last minute unavailability of some patrons who had booked their tickets say one month in advance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-022#265:10>
I am sorry to hear that you have such an unhappy feeling in
that evening .

<ICE-HK:W1B-022#266:10>

I can assure you that racial discrimination is something the Hong
Kong Arts Centre will definitely not exercise or encourage . </p>

continuous support to the Hong Kong Arts Centre programmes . </p>
