<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#1:1:A>
Okay anyway I <.> pre </.> I presume that you  ' ve <.> alr </.>
you  ' ve already done this uh reading <,> and anyone here hasn't done it <,>
you haven't

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#2:1:A>
But anyway I won't be asking you a lot of say difficult questions
just to I mean if you  ' ve been attentive to my lecture you  ' ll be able to
answer some of my questions here

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#3:1:A>
Okay first of all say based on your reading or based on your
understanding of my lectures

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#4:1:A>
I simply would like to find out from you say uhm whether you can
identify some of these circumstances that one will be facing culture shock or
having culture shock problems <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#5:1:A>
I think you should get rid of your habit of jotting down notes when
you have your discussion here <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#6:1:A>
I mean what you need to do here is to think <,> what I I  ' m asking
instead of say jotting down questions or whatever <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#7:1:A>
Anyone

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#8:1:?> They <?> lives </?> <{> <[> a new </[> environment

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#9:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#10:1:A>
Sorry

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#11:1:?> Live in a new environment

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#12:1:A>
Right that mean facing a new environment

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#13:1:A>
It  ' s a time where you  ' ll be facing culture shock but be more
specific try to identify some of these circumstances or situations about
people who  ' ll be facing culture shock <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#14:1:A>
Yes

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#15:1:?> Uh you means <?> which </?> people

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#16:1:A>
Right

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#17:1:?> Uh new immigrants

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#18:1:A>
Sorry

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#19:1:?> New immigrants

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#20:1:A>
Yes the immigrant group so what kind of culture shock problems
<{> <[> do you </[> think they will be having

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#21:1:?> <[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#22:1:?> They may face a <,> they will make some new friends new <.> cul
</.> culture and new environment <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#23:1:A>
You just said they may be facing new <{> <[> friends </[>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#24:1:?> <[> Yes </[> </{> uh but they <?> still or </?> is speaking an
uh uh the other language

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#25:1:A>
Yes

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#26:1:?> And and uh new culture this uh that is really different from
his own culture <&> A long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#27:1:A>
Why not you simply focus on say having new friends in a new
cultural environment

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#28:1:A>
What sort of problems do they have <&> A long pause </&>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#29:1:?> You may feel difficult to work

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#30:1:A>
Right this is something quite likely to take place that is say
when you are in a new environment like these <?> immigranted </?> people it  ' s
likely that they will have that kind of say communication problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#31:1:A>
And mind you don't think that okay supposed now one day you
immigrate since you been educated under this say English medium education you
will be able to communicate well

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#32:1:A>
You will be able to <,> get your message across <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#33:1:A>
As I said before in my lecture <,> when you are in a <.> fam </.>
in a an a in an environment which are quite familiar with you may not be able
to detect your own false or own weaknesses

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#34:1:A>
And like now what I  ' m talking is your communication skills

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#35:1:A>
Okay in lecture or in your seminars you  ' ll seem to be able to use
English to talk to me or to talk to a lecturers

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#36:1:A>
But once you are placed in an environment where people will be
speaking English as their mother tongue you find that a kind of verbal
English communication skills that you  ' ve acquired here in Hong Kong may not
work <,> why

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#37:1:A>
Can someone explain

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#38:1:?> The accent is different

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#39:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#40:1:A>
If people speaking English and then these people have not exposed
themselves to people speak English as a foreign language or people speak
English as a second language they might not be familiar with the kind of
strange accent that these people have speaking English as a second language

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#41:1:A>
And then once they I mean these these native speakers of English
have encountered with <.> si </.> speakers speaking English as a <.> sec </.>
second language

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#42:1:A>
They may find so difficult to understand what they are talking
about <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#43:1:A>
And then it takes you some time to change your own strange accent
which you  ' ve got in your own English <,> okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#44:1:A>
I mean I can give you an example like say in Hong Kong I never
never had any exposure or an encounter with people from other parts of Asia
such as say from India from Pakistan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#45:1:A>
And then when I was in England I talk to these <.> pe </.> I mean I
don't know their language they don't know my language either okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#46:1:A>
So that  ' s why English is the only <.> lang </.> language that say
people can communicate with one another

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#47:1:A>
And then when I talk to these people I find it so difficult to
understand the English used by people who are from India or from Pakistan

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#48:1:A>
So you can imagine in a situation you speak English as a second
language or as a foreign language and then the other person speaks as their
mother tongue

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#49:1:A>
And it it  ' s a same they also have to be patience to try to figure
out from the the strange English that we are speaking to find out what the
actual message is

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#50:1:A>
And then I can give you another example that is say <&> A long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#51:1:A>
How do you pronounce this word <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#52:1:A>
Uhm how do you say this word

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#53:1:A>
Right may be I  ' ve mentioned this word to you already <{> <[> yes
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#54:1:A>
I mean it  ' s a same it  ' s a kind of say example showing to you that

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#55:1:A>
Say we  ' ve got a very strange accent but this word is not the uhm a
matter of accent

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#56:1:A>
It  ' s a matter of mispronunciation which we haven't been able to
realize <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#57:1:A>
Because once you started learning it you just pick up the wrong the
wrong pronunciation and nobody point it out to you in your life

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#58:1:A>
But now you are in another environment and people speaks the
language as their first language <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#59:1:A>
And if they can't figure out say what your message is then you
probably will try to spell out the word to them

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#60:1:A>
And eventually they find they would tell you that okay you  ' ve got
a wrong pronunciation okay

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#61:1:?> <[> Yes </[> </{>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#62:1:?> But is it a big problem for <{> <[> those </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#63:1:A>
<[> It </[> </{> could be as I mention to you already

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#64:1:A>
I  ' ve been repeating the word a couple of times to my professor

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#65:1:A>
He couldn't figure out what what I was talking about until I try to
spell out the word to him <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#66:1:A>
And I  ' m sure that there are quite a number of other examples which
at this moment you won't be <.> fig </.> uh able to detect that you  ' ve uh
got the wrong pronunciation or whatever until one day you really have an
encounter and people point it out to you <,,> okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#67:1:A>
I mean another example is that say it  ' s a a matter of your
intonation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#68:1:A>
Likes it  ' s quite likely that say you probably have been sort of
say having a rising tone all the time in a kind of sentences that you are uhm
talking about in your conversation

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#69:1:A>
But normally it  ' s not necessarily that they all you always have
that kind of rising tone <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#70:1:A>
Eventually probably you I mean like you how how do you say this
word <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#71:1:A>
Uhm <{> <[> sorry </[>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#72:1:?> <[> Boy </[> </{> boyfriend

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#73:1:A>
Right I mean now you may have got it correct boyfriend

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#74:1:A>
But I I find a say many of people in Hong Kong speaking English as
a second language they tend to say boyfriend

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#75:1:A>
I  ' ve got a boyfriend I  ' ve got a girlfriend <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#76:1:A>
I mean is this a kind of phenomenon in Hong Kong yes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#77:1:A>
And I think before I went to London I I did the same

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#78:1:A>
But after having so much say verbal communication with the locals
there I found that I began from that time onward to change my <,> accent as
well as say pronunciation <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#79:1:A>
Okay besides communication problems what else <,> that this I mean
immigrant group will be facing <&> A long pause </&>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#80:1:?> Uhm may be <.> lu </.> uh living style is different between
different culture

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#81:1:?> For example eating habit

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#82:1:A>
Sorry

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#83:1:?> For example eating habit may be <?> there </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#84:1:A>
Can you elaborate this eating habit

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#85:1:?> Uhm <,> may be you <,> uhm now <?> you </?> some <&> A long
pause </&>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#86:1:?> For <?> a sector </?> an example for example a Chinese uh they
like use some uh internal organs to make uh their <?> soup </?> the <unc>
one-word </unc> and the foreigner they don't like that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#87:1:A>
Uhm <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#88:1:A>
But how would this eating habit lead to culture shock

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#89:1:?> Uh <,> the the habits <,> uh knowledge they they they know
that uh their their favourite is is uh dirty things uh in the other people  ' s
mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#90:1:?> I think it  ' s so shock

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#91:1:?> Or uh I mean Chinese <{> <[> people uh </[> don't meet or <,>
<unc> one-word </unc> uh <?> favourites </?> quite often uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#92:1:?> Foreigners will quite uh uhm <,> strange the <?> seed house seed
</?> but I <?> has </?> uh <unc> several words </unc> also

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#93:1:A>
<[> Speak up please </[> </{>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#94:1:?> I think <?> in </?> the immigrant feel that the they <,> will
be a sense of alienated and think that they are not accepted by the other
people in this culture

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#95:1:A>
Right this is the main point

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#96:1:A>
Okay you probable can't have the same kind of food that uh you can
find in a different culture

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#97:1:A>
Like say before when you were in Hong Kong you may eat a lot of all
these uh pig organs which these are English speaking people in America or in
England don't quite like eating okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#98:1:A>
And if you simply means the food <?> per say </?> that is the food
itself

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#99:1:A>
Okay if you can't find that kind of food you can replace it with
something else

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#100:1:A>
And since you live in uh say in in San Francisco or in London you
can eat it if you go to uh Chinatown to get a kind of say uh your favourite
Chinese food

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#101:1:A>
But of course still it  ' s a bit difficult for you to get whole of
this say these are internal organs of pigs or or cows or whatever okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#102:1:A>
But the main point is not just missing the food will lead to
culture shock <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#103:1:A>
Like normally say in Hong Kong you probably will be eating with
your whole family then when you eat you seem to have someone to talk to

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#104:1:A>
Even though I in our lecture I said that you may not have say that
kind of verbal communication you may simply communicate with TV only while
you were eating okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#105:1:A>
But I  ' m sure that say in some families people do have some kind
of verbal communication to improve their relationship while they were eating
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#106:1:A>
But since you are so used to having a group of people eating and
now you are alone may be in a situation as a student

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#107:1:A>
And once you <,> eat you found that you always be alone and this
will sort of say leading you to think of the kind of good time that you have
with your family okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#108:1:A>
That is say sort of say reminding you that you are being lonely
here okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#109:1:A>
And this will sort of say bring you into that kind of say
emotional or psychological disorientation making you feel more lonely

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#110:1:A>
Okay another point is that okay may be you take a friend out to a
Chinese restaurant overseas and then you be ordering this uh chicken feet or
say liver or kidneys

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#111:1:A>
And then when the other person who <,> is not so used to eating
all these organs

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#112:1:A>
And then they  ' ve got another interpretation of your your
character <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#113:1:A>
As I said before people from difficult cultures will have their
own value systems

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#114:1:A>
I mean to them may be say dogs or cats or birds I mean pigeons you
know like in Hong Kong will I mean say that <?> can </?> say roast pigeon is
the favourite of many people <indig> siu yuh gap </indig> <&> These Cantonese
words refer to roast pigeon </&> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#115:1:A>
In London it  ' s impossible that you I mean you sort of say telling
people that we eat pigeons

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#116:1:A>
Because to them pigeon is something which ought to be protected
right

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#117:1:A>
Because pigeon to them is a a symbol of peace you can't eat them

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#118:1:A>
Or say dogs they regard dogs as their friends <,> that  ' s why in
the parks you can <?> think </?> you can see the scene

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#119:1:A>
At the weekend a lot of people take their dogs out to the park

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#120:1:A>
They kiss their their dogs right

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#121:1:A>
And then you tell them that say you you eat that kind of say uh
dog meat or organs from that kind of say their their favourite pets

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#122:1:A>
So you can imagine that they could have a misinterpretation of
your character

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#123:1:A>
And in that case this may develop a kind of say uh blockage
blocking you from making friends with another one from a different culture

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#124:1:A>
And what could the result be

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#125:1:A>
And then that that person may refuse to make friends with you

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#126:1:A>
And as a result that means your your alienation will be getting
more serious <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#127:1:A>
So I won't be refuting that eating habits could be a kind of
culture shock but you ought to thought it think about it deeper not so
thinking about say missing food <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#128:1:A>
Because normally say wherever you go you  ' ll be I mean expecting
that you won't be able to have the same type of food <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#129:1:A>
But it  ' s easily to make adjustment after you  ' ve settled
somewhere for little for a while <,> okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#130:1:A>
And then besides this immigrants group say what other groups of
people that you can identify who be facing culture shock <&> A long pause
</&>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#131:1:?> Overseas students

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#132:1:A>
Yes can you identify some of the problems

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#133:1:?> They the way they learn in school <,> is different from Hong
Kong <unc> one-word </unc> and United States

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#134:1:A>
Right I quite agree say on I mean this is something that be
repeating in my lectures that is say as an overseas student and then you are
in a different cultural environment doing your studies

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#135:1:A>
And then you find a say the way uh you learn could be say
different from what you had before and it takes you some time to find out the
expectations of your lecturer

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#136:1:A>
I mean now you may not be able to tell that say whether uh the
expectations of uh lecturer here is high or low

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#137:1:A>
Because you got no comparison <,> but as I said just in the
lecture before you come in you  ' ll find that say <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#138:1:A>
Since say these people say that these lecturers they speak English
as the as their first language <,> and then they they probably say will
expect a lot from you especially in terms of the use of language okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#139:1:A>
And then now if when you are in Hong Kong you find that your your
assignments have been accepted by all these lecturers they won't be say
pointing out to you that say they can't understand what you mean in your in
your papers

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#140:1:A>
But it may happen that say people who speak English as their first
first language they probably will find out that they will query they may not
be able to understand say some parts of your essays <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#141:1:A>
And then you might be asked to rewrite it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#142:1:A>
And then that will sort of say bring you back to your query in
Hong Kong about the standard here or the expectations here of your lecturers
<,> in the <.> Poly </.> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#143:1:A>
I mean when you suspect this or suspect that you make all sort of
queries that means you are actually in a kind of say psychological imbalance
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#144:1:A>
What else what other problems that say overseas students might be
having <&> A long pause </&>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#145:1:?> The life style of student himself is different from other
students the local students there

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#146:1:?> For example may be students from Hong Kong <,> even after school
they may go back to their home and do their <?> services </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#147:1:?> However the local students there they prefer some extra activities
like to go uh a basketball watching <unc> one-word </unc> willing to
watch a basketball match <unc> one-word </unc>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-016#148:1:A>
Yes I think that say this has got something to do with value
system as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#149:1:A>
Like to many of these uhm English speaking persons they sort of
have uh having make a very clear distinction between work and rest <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#150:1:A>
May be to them from nine to five is their time for work but after
that no more work just find something that they like

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#151:1:A>
Just find something to help them to relax

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#152:1:A>
And it  ' s a same to these students who are educated and brought up
in an English speaking environment <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#153:1:A>
May be after class they will think that okay either I go to do my
part time job to earn money to <.> su </.> to support myself because normally
they are quite say financially independent once they reach say the age of
sixteen <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#154:1:A>
And to many of the Chinese students who study overseas <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#155:1:A>
They will think that say since they spend so much money their
parents give them so much money to go overseas to study

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#156:1:A>
They must try to get good academic results in order to meet the
expectations of their parents

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#157:1:A>
So instead they might be even though they might be invited to go
to parties but they just feel guilty of not working hard enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-016#158:1:A>
And as a as a result what would happen <,> uhm </I>
