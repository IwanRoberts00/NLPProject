<ICE-HK:S1A-054#143:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#144:1:A>
I think I will enjoy the life

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#145:1:A>

$A-laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X146:1:Z>
Uh uh <,> I think your chances are good <{> <[> <&>

$Z-laughs </&> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#147:1:A>
<[> No because </[> </{> the uh in Hong Kong there are so
many beautiful ladies <,> and <,> the men <,> they choose their their
girlfriend <,> with very high qualification

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#148:1:A>
High needs <,> not high wants <,> about the girls

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#149:1:A>
They they need a <.> tru </.> uh girl <,> beautiful <,> uh slim
<,> uh lady uhm <,> they they <.> pu </.> they put more emphasize on the <,>
uh on the appearance of the girl <,> so I think <,> I have little little

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X150:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#153:1:A>
To to <,> uhm <,> it can uh bring uh to to keep fit <,> can be
beneficial to find a job <,> because <,> when you find a job <,> you will
employ a person with <,> uh good looking <,> uh don't uh fat and it seem that
<,> it is not uh <,> so mobile in <,> physically <,> so I think it is very
important for <,> for occupation and also for marriage

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X154:1:Z>
For everything <,> for your work <{1> <[1> <,> and </[1> for <,>

If you are fit <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> your chance is quite well
known

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X156:1:Z>
Your chance of optimistic <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> <unc> one-word

<,> and you have everything

<[6> I I </[6> </{6> really worry about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#165:1:A>
Uh <,> you don't know <&>

$A-laughs and then both laugh </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X166:1:Z>
This is first time I hear this about Hong <,> because the
students of course don't tell me these interesting things </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#167:1:A>
Actually <,> we will not talk about this in the lesson you
know

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#168:1:A>
There are many people

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#169:1:A>
They will smile

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#170:1:A>
They will laugh at me <,> and I will not talk about this <,> but
<{> <[> <,> </[> in at this moment <,> I can tell you this about

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X171:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X172:1:Z>
Right it  ' s quite privileged to hear some <,> uh of course I
don't believe you <,> because you  ' re so <,> you look so <,,> <&> tut </&> uh
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X173:1:Z>
We say spunky

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X174:1:Z>
You know it means <,> you  ' ve got energy <,> and you  ' re
intelligent so <,> I don't believe <,> somebody <,> won't snatch you up <{>
<[> <,> </[> if you want a man

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X175:1:Z>
They are not so important </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#176:1:A>
<[> <&>

$A-laughs </&> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#177:1:A>
You are a working woman <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#178:1:A>
Yes <,> it uhm <,> do you think uh you value <,> uh occupation <,>
in a very high <,> important position for your whole life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X179:1:Z>
Do I have what </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#180:1:A>
Uh <,> do you <,> vary your occupation <,> uh very important
<,> for your whole life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X181:1:Z>
Do you do you mean do I worry </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#182:1:A>
No <.> var </.> vary vary <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#183:1:A>
That means uh <,> do you think <,> occupation is very important uh
is a important part <,> in the whole life <,> or or family life or uh
marriage

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#184:1:A>
Which one do you <.> va </.> value

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#185:1:A>
<{> <[> Put a higher value <,> for the </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X186:1:Z>
<[> Put a higher value <,> value </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X187:1:Z>
I didn't catch you <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> <?> then
</?> </[2> value </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#188:1:A>
<[> Uhm <,> I  ' m sorry </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X189:1:Z>
Uhm <,> well <,> in in my way <,> I  ' m the wrong generation <,>
you know <,> I because my choices are so long ago

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X190:1:Z>
I made my choices so long ago <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> <,> but already
then <,> I  ' ve valued <,,> the idea that I could be independent <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> so I graduated and <,> could I knew I could have a job <{3 > <[3> <,>
</[3> and always support myself <{4 > <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X191:1:Z>
And now my opinion is that in a marriage <,> if you have worked
<{5 > <[5> <,> </[5> you understand the pressure <,> that a man <,> uh
experiences <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X192:1:Z>
If you worked in a <,> demanding job it  ' s important

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X193:1:Z>
And when you are handling <,> when you have <,> important
decisions with your children <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and I  ' ve had very difficult
decisions <,> because my children were difficult

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X194:1:Z>
My boys were difficult

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X195:1:Z>
It  ' s very important <,> somehow for some reasons it  ' s important
to know <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> you have your own place <,> as a <,> working like
as an operating person in the society <{9> <[9> <,> </[9> so for me <,> it  ' s
being very important <{10> <[10> <,> </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X196:1:Z>
But <,> unfortunately <,> I don't <,> my job isn't really I have
didn't work into <,> a high status

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X197:1:Z>
I <{11> <[11> always </[11> <,> uh help my husband <,> study and
<,> have promotion and so on <{12> <[12> <,> </[12> which uhm <,> I wouldn't
<,> I don't know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X198:1:Z>
I don't know whether I would recommend it for my daughter <{13>
<[13> <,> </[13>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X199:1:Z>
I don't I think <,> I should have struggled more <,> for equality
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#200:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#201:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#202:1:A>

<[13> Uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#213:1:A>
Uhm <,> for me uh <,> uh at the present time <,> I  ' ve I have same
ambition with you <,> to be a independent <,> uhm independent girl <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#214:1:A>
After my graduation <,> I would like to find a job <,> and also
<,> earn some money for a few years and go abroad to have a study

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#215:1:A>
I really want to go abroad to study because <,> I think that it
can give me many opportunities to <,> to learn learn things

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#216:1:A>
There are many things for me to learn uh I want to see <,> what
are happening in the foreign country

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#217:1:A>
I haven't been <,> uh to this that <,> uhm for example USA <,>
Britain I have not been there before

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#218:1:A>
I really hope to <,> hope to go there and <,> see <,> what <,>
what are people doing <,> uh <,> and so on

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#219:1:A>
I really hope to do so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X220:1:Z>
<?> Would </?> you <,> do you want to <,> study <,> or work <,>
or just uh experience </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#221:1:A>
Uhm <,> I have thought about before <,> uh to find a job in
Singapore <,> and or or or maybe to uh to have further study in Britain or
USA <{> <[> <,> </[> I have thought about before <,> that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X222:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X223:1:Z>
Uhm <,> one if the things that  ' s interesting is that <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> when you visit a country <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> it  ' s very different
to <,> living and working in the country

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X224:1:Z>
Now if you come to Hong Kong <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> you think <,> oh
oh it  ' s like this <,> and you <.> don </.> don't find that anything <,> the
tourists <,> won't find that anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#225:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#226:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#227:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#228:1:A>
Uhm <,> do you have any <?> adaption </?> problem uh at at the
first time you you live in Hong Kong <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X229:1:Z>
Well <,> I don't know whether you call them <,> problems of
adaptation <,> a lot of frustration </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#230:1:A>
A lot of frustration

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X231:1:Z>
Yeah <,> even today this morning perfect example

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X232:1:Z>
I have a <,> uh gas heater not working in my kitchen </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#233:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X234:1:Z>
So I want to tell somebody

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X235:1:Z>
And I had to ask three people before I could say in English

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X236:1:Z>
This is the <{1> <[1> Hong Kong </[1> Gas Company <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X237:1:Z>
Huge <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and then I say twenty-fifth floor and
they said twenty-three

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X238:1:Z>
I said no twenty-five

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X239:1:Z>
I can't even said fifth <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> because it confuses
the number so I say twenty-five floor <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X240:1:Z>
Of course I  ' m not being rude

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X241:1:Z>
I  ' m just making sure <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> they come to my place
<,> <{6> not <[6> </[6> somewhere else <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X242:1:Z>
So <,> uhm <,,> <.> s </.> some little difficulties like for the
housewife <,> there are <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> uh <,> difficulties of not
finding thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X243:1:Z>
You just have to <,> uh <&> tut </&> do it differently <{8> <[8>
<,,> </[8> so that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X244:1:Z>
And <,> for work <,> the adaptation is <,> uh just uhm <,> an <.>
exper </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X245:1:Z>
It  ' s very interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X246:1:Z>
The students are very different <{9> <[9> <,> </[9> but the <,>
adaptation problem is just <,> finding something else like you saying today
<?> in a bit </?> difficult to find their husband or <,> just the way
students would accept <,> that <,> fitting in with Hong Kong  ' s way <,> is
very enjoyable </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#247:1:A>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#248:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#249:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#250:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#251:1:A>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#252:1:A>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#253:1:A>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#254:1:A>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#255:1:A>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#256:1:A>
Enjoyable

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X257:1:Z>
That part <,> just finding out that it is different and then <,>
how is it different

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X258:1:Z>
That  ' s interesting <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X259:1:Z>
But dealing with people <,> when I want to <,> get a telephone
message <,> that  ' s very boring <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X260:1:Z>
Just <,> trying to be patient <,> or going to a shop <,> and not
being able to buy something very very simple <,> that was my big problem <,>
when I came here </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#261:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#262:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#263:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#264:1:A>
Because I think uh in Hong Kong <,> uh <.> man </.> <,> many
people can speak English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X265:1:Z>
Not in the little

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X266:1:Z>
If you want to buy some paint or fix some furniture or fix
something in your house or your plugs don't work <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> you have
to write it down in <.> Chin </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X267:1:Z>
It  ' s actually <,> if it  ' s <,> all the clothes <,> all the <,>
you think everything  ' s in the big department store <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but
if it <,> isn't there <{3> <[3> <,> you  ' re in </[3> real trouble </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#268:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#269:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#270:1:A>
<[3> Oh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#271:1:A>
Uhm <,> do you have any Chinese friends

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X272:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#273:1:A>

They help me

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X275:1:Z>
I say <,> write this down for me <&>

$A-laughs </&> please

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X276:1:Z>
I  ' m going to the shop to buy some paint <,> or lacquer or
something <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X277:1:Z>
Yeah <,> I have to do this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#278:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> <&>

$A-laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#279:1:A>
Uhm <,,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#280:1:A>
How about <unc> one-word </unc> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#281:1:A>
Uh do you find any difficulty to <,> to <,> uh <,> to get along
with <,> uh Chinese people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X282:1:Z>
Well <,> I think I don't have any difficulty <{1> <[1> because
</[1> uhm although I don't have a career <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X283:1:Z>
I I think I don't have a career because I  ' m a temporary English
instructor <,> but I  ' m passionate <,> about language <,> and about people

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X284:1:Z>
That  ' s really my life <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X285:1:Z>
So <,> I think I  ' ll get on <,> with people and <,> I love it <,>
<{4> <[4> I mean </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X286:1:Z>
I actually <,> love trying to <,> communicate <,> <{5> <[5> so
</[5> it  ' s it  ' s not <,> for me it  ' s <,> that  ' s where the <,> interesting
life is <,> so it  ' s not <,> I think it  ' s alright for me </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#287:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#288:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#289:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#290:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#291:1:A>
<[5> Oh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#292:1:A>
I think you are a <.> ou </.> outgoing person

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#293:1:A>
Do you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X294:1:Z>
Actually <,> I  ' m quite shy <,> but because I  ' m so <,>
interested in language <{1> <[1> <,> I <unc> three words </unc> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X295:1:Z>
I said to my husband <,> you know the fact that we came to Hong
Kong is just an unexpected <,> bonus

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X296:1:Z>
You know bonus like <{2> <[2> you get a salary </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X297:1:Z>
Nobody said we would ever come to Hong Kong <,> cos we <,> we <,>
we just had ordinary jobs <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> so it  ' s a a <,> a gift <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X298:1:Z>
Real bonus <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> very interesting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#299:1:A>
Uhm <[1> <,> so you want to <unc> several words
</unc> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#300:1:A>
<[2> Uhm <,> uhm uhm uhm <,> uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#301:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#302:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#303:1:A>
Uh <,> how do you think about <,> Chinese people <,> because <,>
in my <,> in my opinion <,> Chinese people uh to some extent are <.> se </.>
quite selfish and <,> also <,> they they they in some times will be
inconsiderate of <,> other people <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#304:1:A>
For for example <,> uhm <,> you can see <,> there are many rubbish
in <,> uh on the pavement <,> and <,> uh when you go to the countryside and
to have a BBQ <,> barbecue <,> you you will find <,> the whole place is
covered with rubbish <,> so I think <,> sometimes Chinese people are <,> are
selfish <,> rather <,> uh compared with foreign <,> people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X305:1:Z>
Well <,> it  ' s a little bit sweeping to say <,> foreign people
are tidy <,> careful of the environment <,> Chinese people aren't <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X306:1:Z>
But yes <,> I <{1> <[1> definitely </[1> notice that <,> and I
definitely <,> I could say <,> to you <,> <{2> <[2> I </[2> hate it

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X307:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> I hate it </[3> or throwing things down <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X308:1:Z>
But <,,> everyone <,> no Americans Australians English <,>
everyone probably does it a bit too <{5> <[5> <,> but </[5> <,,> when I went
for a walk <unc> two words </unc> around the reservoir <,> uh <,>
near the peak <,> and there was no litter <,> not nothing drop </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#309:1:A>

<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#311:1:A>
<[3> I hate it </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#312:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#313:1:A>
<[5> Really </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#314:1:A>
Because this is a <.> tou </.> a a place for the tourist to come

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X315:1:Z>
And I said to my husband <,> yesterday and I said <,> isn't it
<,> beautiful <&>

$A laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X316:1:Z>
No plastic bags <,> because <,> we walk along from Queen Mary
along <{1> <[1> the </[1> peak there <,> to the University <,> and there is
litter <,> and there is no we think there  ' s no reason for this it  ' s a
beautiful walk <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and there is rubbish

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X317:1:Z>
Yes so I had I <,> for me <,,> Yes <,> I I notice it and I don't
like it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#318:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#319:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#320:1:A>
Uhm <,> but uh one <,> uh for Chinese people <,> I like their <,>
some characteristic

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#321:1:A>
For example they are <,> quite <,> they quite respect their
origins of a country

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#322:1:A>
For example <,> I  ' m a Chinese people <,> uhm <,> we will <,> uh
we will give our <,> concern to the Chinese people in <,> all over the world
in other country for example in China <,> and in other countries

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#323:1:A>
For example <,> in the recent time <,> there is a <,> a earthquake

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#324:1:A>
There was a earthquake in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#325:1:A>
Many <,> uh in the TV program <,> they <,> they <,> they <,> they
say that <,> they ask people to donate uh the blankets <,> the clothes for
<,> for the people who suffered in the China

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#326:1:A>
Many people <,> do so

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#327:1:A>
They <,> they are so generous to <,> give out their money <,>
their <,> their food <,> to those people so <,> it is a kind of <,> good
behaviour of the Chinese people <,> I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X328:1:Z>
Yes <,> very noticeable <,> when in my first year here <,> one of
the <,> uh English instructors <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> not Chinese <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> an English woman <,> was sick in hospital <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> and all
the staff <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> Chinese staff <,> very much so <,> raise money

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X329:1:Z>
We raise money and this person <,> got almost a month  ' s salary
<{5> <[5> <,> </[5> uh <,> which <,> was the first time I  ' ve seen <,> this
<{6> <[6> <,> </[6> because <,> well <,> in Australia <,> we all have <,>
sick pay worker  ' s compensation so <,> we have <,> we have <,> money still
comes in even if we are sick <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X330:1:Z>
But here <,> if you  ' re if you are not <,> in

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X331:1:Z>
In many jobs <,> when you are sick <,> <{8> <[8> money stops
</[8> <,> and so there is a very <,> I was stunned actually amazed of the
generosity <{9> <[9> <,> </[9> of people who <,> only knew this person very
little <{10> <[10> <,> </[10> contributing <,> what must have I don't know
how much people contributed but the total <,> was very impressive <{11> <[11>
<,> </[11> and people have done that three times <,> now <{12> <[12> <,> <?>
for </?> </[12> three different people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#332:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#333:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#340:1:A>
<[9> Uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#341:1:A>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<[11> Uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#343:1:A>
<[12> Three times </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#344:1:A>
The <.> pe </.> uhm don't uhm the <,> the <,> the staff is
suffered from <,> very <,> big disease

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X345:1:Z>
One person <,> had a back problem and didn't come back to work

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X346:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> She </[1> was hospitalized and had a operation <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X347:1:Z>
And in the case of another one one of our colleagues <,> actually
died of cancer <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X348:1:Z>
Yeah <,> he very young

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X349:1:Z>
Thirty <{4> <[4> four </[4> <,> thirty <,> three or four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X350:1:Z>
So the first time <,> we raise money <,> when she was sick <,>
and stopped work <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> and then we raise a little bit of money
because she has two children <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X351:1:Z>
And <,> but she died last year

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X352:1:Z>
She died very quickly <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X353:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#365:1:A>
I really <,> afraid to see this moment <,> in the future

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#366:1:A>
I I really <,> I <,> I I think I cannot <,> stand with <,> this
kind of <,> frustration and <,> unhappiness

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X367:1:Z>
But we have not <,> we just lucky <,> in health <,> or not lucky

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X368:1:Z>
How could <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X369:1:Z>
You have to stand it <,> if it  ' s in your family </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#370:1:A>
Uhm <,> I  ' m afraid of this <{> <[> <,> </[> actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X371:1:Z>
<[> No </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X372:1:Z>
Then think about it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#373:1:A>
Yes yes yes <,> I I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X374:1:Z>
Stay fit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#375:1:A>
Uhm so uhm I have a dream <,> uh <,> in the future

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#376:1:A>
I can make money <,> uh buy a big house <,> uh <,> to <,> invite
all my relatives and <,> we live together

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#377:1:A>
<Indig> Wah </indig> <,> it is a perfect life <,> for <{> <[> my
life </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#378:1:A>
It is my future dream but I think <,> can it be fulfilled in

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X379:1:Z>
<[> uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X380:1:Z>
Will you do that in Hong Kong or China

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X381:1:Z>
This big house <,> where will it be </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#382:1:A>
In Hong Kong <,> in Hong Kong <,> uhm <,> in a countryside

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#383:1:A>
<Indig> Wah </indig> <,> it is so <,> comfortable <,> but it is
not so <,,> practical <,> I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#384:1:A>
Uh <,> you to live in Hong Kong it is <,> uh if you work <,> there  ' re
many things to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#385:1:A>
You have to <,> uh not only the job <,> but you have to <,> how to
deal with the relationship with your colleagues <,> your boss <,> your client

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#386:1:A>
Oh <,> there are many things which can <,> which can frustrate
your <,> frustrate you <,> to <,> to have <,> <.> ful </.> to fulfill your
dream

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X387:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#388:1:A>
Because uh my brother said that <,> you have to try to go out
to work <,> to see <,> what are the difficulties they face

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#389:1:A>
Many many things

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#390:1:A>
I really <,> don't <,> sometime I really don't know how to deal
with <,> people because <,> <.> pe </.> uhm I think uh in the outside world
<,> especially in the working world people are <,> quite <,> they have the
conflict interest conflict between each other because they all <,> want to be
promoted to the upper <,> position in the organization so <,> I think <,> uh
it is quite difficult to find a friends <.> af </.> after when I go out to
work <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#391:1:A>
Do you <,> do you think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X392:1:Z>
Well <,> I don't know because <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> this is
something I really <,> don't know because <,> Hong Kong is very different
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X393:1:Z>
And one thing I do say is <,> uh well first of all <,> I could
never compete in Hong Kong in the business world <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> <.>
becau </.> <,> for the reason you say </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-054#394:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#395:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#396:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#397:1:A>
Oh you agree

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X398:1:Z>
I think there is some <,> there is competition <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> and it  ' s very different to anything I <,> am good at <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X399:1:Z>
And <,> my husband is also in the University job <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> <,> so <,> I  ' m very very glad for this <,> because the unknown <,,>
stress and conflict <{4> <[4> and </[4> drive for promotion unknown <,> for
us to uh I mean what we can analyze <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X400:1:Z>
I think <,> for a westerner <,,> <unc> one word </unc>
have to have a very special skill or <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X401:1:Z>
I don't know what you need <{6> <[6> but </[6> I don't have it
<,> and I don't think my husband has it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X402:1:Z>
And I think you  ' re <.> ri </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X403:1:Z>
I think you are quite correct and clever well intelligent to keep
in mind that it is like that <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and <,> maybe a big firm
will train you or <,> if your brother already works <,> uh or you make some
friends who are willing to <,> uhm <,> discuss things with you

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X404:1:Z>
I think you need something but I think you

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X405:1:Z>
It  ' s <,> pretty good pretty <,> important that you should be <,>
Chinese to start with <{8> <[8> <,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X406:1:Z>
I I  ' m not saying this out <,> because <,> from prejudice <,> I
just think that the business world in Hong Kong <,,> just thinking

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X407:1:Z>
I think it  ' s tough

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X408:1:Z>
I think it  ' s competitive <,> and I don't think I have <,> what
it takes <,> to be there <,> or to be successful there

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X409:1:Z>
<{9> <[9> I  ' m </[9> sure I don't </X>

<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X421:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X422:1:Z>
Uh <,> in Australia <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> this would not that part
wasn't important <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X423:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> I  ' ve </[2> just happened already to be a teacher <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X424:1:Z>
You know but uhm <,,> I  ' m just saying that my husband <,> could
try consultancy in Australia but I don't think well he might but <,> he
wouldn't try business <,> in Hong Kong <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X425:1:Z>
But he I think he would try in Aus <,> he probably will try <,>
even he  ' ll retire and then <,> because he will be very qualified when we go
home <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X426:1:Z>
But <,> in Hong Kong he could he could only <,> operate as an
established person at the University not as a business person <{6> <[6> <,>
</[6> because the <,> the unwritten <,> law unwritten <,> uh <,> dynamics uh
<,> you know beyond us <,> <{7> <[7> I think </[7> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#X427:1:Z>
Uhm <,,> but there  ' re not be <,> you will learn them <,> because
you <,> you are born to learn them </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-054#428:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

I <,> I don't really <,> I don't really know <,> whether I can
