<ICE-HK:W2B-034#10:1>
When I reviewed the original single-player game of <it> The Sims
</it> about two years ago , I found it boring , unfulfulling and repetitive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#11:1>
It went on to become one of the best-selling games ever , spawned
five expansion sets , and even today takes up about five slots on the top-20
best-selling list . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#12:1>
What I found finding - developing skills to execute more animated
expressions and buying new items for houses - others found exciting .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#13:1>
I suspect the house-building and interior-design aspects of the game
are a big draw . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#14:1>
Recently , I saw a beautifully designed bedroom set with a bed ,
drawers and a pair of paintings , all done in Japanese style that you could
download .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#15:1>
There are many other examples of interior designs created by fans ,
free to download into your Sims world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#16:1>
One reason that sales of this game are so high is that many
non-gamers find it appealing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#17:1>
For example , many women who do not play other computer games are
addicted to <it> The Sims </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#18:1>
<it> The Sims Online </it> is a subscription-based game that
requires a fee of US&dollar;9.99 per month , with the first month free .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#19:1>
All the players live , play and interact in a virtual world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#20:1>
You are encouraged to buy property , design your own house and find
house-mates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#21:1>
All the characters one encounters are real people .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#22:1>
Previously boring character interactions are now absolutely
fascinating to me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#23:1>
In my first few days online , another player tried to trick me into
handling over all my precious starting money &obrack;  he claimed we could magically
multiply our money , if I would only let him hold my money for a bit &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#24:1>
I was invited to become someone  ' s room-mate and found an online
girlfriend , who was then courted by another player .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#25:1>
Later , I found out from my room-mate that my girlfriend had dumped
me and married someone else . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#26:1>
I have met a lot more people since then and now when I log on I
have &ldquo; miss you &rdquo; messages from my new fiancee .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#27:1>
We are saving money to get married , buy our own place and start a
business .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#28:1>
None of that ever happened to me in the single-player game ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#29:1>
I have also encountered a lot of immaturity - the occasional
teenage boy who thinks it is funny to pretend to be a female Sim .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#30:1>
Their immaturity ususlly betrays them quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#31:1>
One even kicked me out of his house for not handling over money .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#32:1>
The game is more fun if you are a mature person who enjoys
talking and meeting other people .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#33:1>
For parents with children there are security features that parents
can set so that no one can talk to the child without parental approval . </p>
<O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#34:1>
<it> The Sims Online </it> is a great way for social people to
meet one other .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#35:1>
I can imagine shy people might even come out of their shells as they
can meet people behind the safety of a computer screen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#36:1>
Some buttons on the interface have not been implemented yet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#37:1>
I am not sure if this means the game is unfinished , but game updates
seem to take place on a fairly regularly basis .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#38:1>
The last two have required 6.5-megabyte downloads . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#39:1>
Many of the players I found online were fans of the original Sims
but found the online game much more fun .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#40:1>
They love to show off their interior design skills and invite people
over .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#41:1>
They also love the real-people interaction , as I do . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#42:1>
But what do I know ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#43:1>
<it> The Sims </it> is one of the best-selling games ever .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#44:1>
I did not like it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#45:1>
<it> The Sims Online </it> has not met sales targets , but I am
addicted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#54:2>
<bold> Pros: </bold> Creative , new real-time strategy with a
twist </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#55:2>
<bold> Cons: </bold> Not enough players online </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#56:2>
<bold> Price: </bold> HK&dollar;250 </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#57:2>
Relic Entertainment  ' s first game , <it> Homeworld </it> , was a
fantastic debut and garnered rave reviews .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#58:2>
Now , Relic is back and bringing some impossible creature with it .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#59:2>
<it> Impossible Creatures </it> is a real-time strategy game that
finally moves away from the common historical and space themes and into the
realm of bio-science . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#60:2>
The game is set in 1937 , so the technologies are powered by two
resources - coal and electricity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#61:2>
An eccentric scientist provides just enough out-of-the-box thinking
to create the technology that allows you to combine the characteristics of
two animals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#62:2>
By mixing and matching characteristics from two animal types ,
you can create impossible creatures with which to wage war . </p> <O> Three
photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#63:2>
Animal anatomy is broken down into seven possible sections: head
, torse , front legs , back legs , tail , wings and pincers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#64:2>
I combined a wolverine with an armadillo to create a &ldquo;
wolverdillo" , my thinking being that the front legs and head of the
wolverine would give my creaure a vicious bite and the shell of the armadillo
would give it a good defence when fighting up close . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#65:2>
By clicking on the different parts of the anatomy , I can choose
if I want , say , the head to come from the wolverine or the armadillo . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#66:2>
Another of my creations copied the mythological flying snake .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#67:2>
It had the wings of an owl and the body of a snake .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#68:2>
Best of all , it spat acid ! I also combined a coyote and a frog to
create a &ldquo; coyrog &rdquo; and a wolf and a lobster to create a &ldquo;
wobster" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#69:2>
Creating impossible creatures is great fun , and I spent loads of
time just mixing and matching different animals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#70:2>
The possibilities are endless and make for hours of fun .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#71:2>
With so many combinations to play with , many games are spent
wondering: &ldquo; What is that thing ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#72:2>
It  ' s killing me ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#73:2>
Once you have created your impossible creature , you can store
the blueprint .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#74:2>
You can also build any creature from your library during combat .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#75:2>
There are pre-built libraries , but they are not half as much fun
as fighting your opponent with your own creations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#76:2>
Your creature types can be upgraded by building a workshop .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#77:2>
Using the workshop , you can upgrade a creature  ' s attacks , movement
and defence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#78:2>
Claws can be made made longer and sharper . Poison spit can become
more corrosive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#79:2>
As its animalistic heart , though , <it> Impossible Creatures
</it> is still a real-time strategy game .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#80:2>
You still gather resources to power your buildings and create your
creatures .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#81:2>
More powerful creatures are accessible once you upgraded your
buildings and , as with other real-time strategy games , baddest units
usually wins . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#82:2>
It is undoubtedly a lot of fun to see how your invented creatures
fare against the inventions of other players .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#83:2>
Unfortunately , I  ' m not finding a great many players online , so you
may have to bring your own friends to the party . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#84:2>
Graphically , the engine is one of the best I have seen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#85:2>
The ability to smoothly rotate and zoom from any angle is a Relic
hallmark .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#86:2>
The campaign is your usual fare , with some good production values
but average overall . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#87:2>
The mood and setting are different from <it> Homeworld </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#88:2>
<it> Impossible Creatures </it> is cartoonish and carefree , whereas
<it> Homeworld </it> is serious and sombre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#89:2>
Relic is quickly building a reputation for developing creative
real-time strategy games with a twist .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#90:2>
With <it> Homeworld </it> , it created a fully 3D space , with <it>
Impossible Creatures </it> , the twist is the ability easily to create your
own customized army and see how it fares , never sure what enemies you are
going to face . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-034#91:2>
I thoroughly enjoy <it> Impossible Creatures </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#92:2>
Each defect drives me back to the lab to experiment with creating new
monstrosities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#93:2>
I  ' ve never been so much fun losing ! </p>

<h> <bold> Colour-display devices such as the Smartphone Qtek 7070
have short battery lives . Packing more features into devices worsens the
problem . <it> Picture by Edward Wong </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#100:3>

<p> Research In Motion introduced its first colour-screen BlackBerry handheld
last week . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#101:3>

<p> Not only is the device streets behind the competition when it comes to
features , it is expensive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#102:3>
Expected to cost nearly HK&dollar;6,000 , the new BlackBerry 7230 is
a technological dinosaur compared with many products from Palm ,
Sony-Ericsson and Nokia . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#103:3>

<p> BlackBerry fans have in the past argued that a colour display is a
nice-to-have , rather than a must-have , feature that drains batteries . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#104:3>

<p> They are prepared to live without it because having a longer battery life
is more important . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#105:3>

<p> They have a good point .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#106:3>
Many colour devices , such as the Microsoft Smartphone QTek 7070 ,
have dismally short battery life. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#107:3>

<p> In addition to juice-sapping features like a colour display and
backlighting , wireless functions such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi , games ,
Web-browsing , digital cameras and multimedia messaging use up power quickly .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#108:3>

<p> The QTek lasts about five hours with normal phone usage , some game
playing and some multimedia messaging .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#109:3>
Handsets should ideally last eight to 12 hours without a recharge .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#110:3>

<p> Today  ' s most advanced mobile phones are more computer than phone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#111:3>
Top-of-the-line models from Nokia , Sony-Ericsson , Samsung and
Motorola have e-mail , embedded digital cameras , Bluetooth , games and
stereo sound . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#112:3>

<p> Combination devices such as Palm  ' s Tungsten W or O2  ' s xDA have larger
colour displays and are jammed with more applications , requiring even more
power. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#113:3>

<p> The problem of battery life has long dogged portable devices .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#114:3>
Limited battery life is one of the main complaints of users of
laptops , personal digital assistants and mobile phones . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#115:3>

<p> At the same time , consumers continue to demand more from these devices ,
which in turn requires manufacturers to incorporate applications that consume
even greater amounts of power . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#116:3>

<p> While battery technologies have made big strides in the past 15 years ,
even the best , such as lithium-ion cells , only power one to two hours of
heavy use . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#117:3>

<p> Device makers face weight constraints when it comes to batteries .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#118:3>
They have to be small and light enough not to add substantial bulk ,
and they must be able to last a while between recharges . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#119:3>

<p> Some devices come with power management software that extends battery
life by up to 20 per cent by putting infrequently used functions on standby
or disabling them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#120:3>
Some devices use low-power chips from Intel and Transmeta . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#121:3>

<p> If you are working in a well-lit room , you can reduce screen brightness
to save power .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#122:3>
Small measures such as these can conserve an hour or two of battery
power . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#123:3>

<p> Consumer electronics companies such as Sony , Sanyo and NEC are doing a
lot of research on extending battery life and looking for alternatives to
nickel cadmium batteries that power most portable electronic devices . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#124:3>

<p> Several technology start-ups in the United States are racing to produce
the first commercial fuel cell for portable products , potentially a
multibillion-dollar business .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#125:3>
Many are working on methane-powered fuel cells , already used in
some cars . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#126:3>

<p> Motorola demonstrated a methane-powered fuel cell for mobile phones in
2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#127:3>
The cell is a little longer and thicker than the average mobile
phone , and stores methane in an area the size of a ballpoint pen  ' s ink
holder .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#128:3>
A chemical reaction releases oxygen , heat and electricity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#129:3>
The electricity then either powers the device directly or charges
another battery . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#130:3>

<p> While Motorola has yet to roll out a commercial product , methanol fuel
cells are expected to power laptops and mobile phones in two years , maybe
less . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#131:3>

<p> NEC is working on a methanol cell , expected to be in production by 2005
at the latest , that will give 10 times more power per weight than
lithium-ion at the same cost .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#132:3>
If successful , NEC  ' s new fuel cells will be able to power mobile
phones for weeks without a recharge . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#133:3>

<p> A highly flammable liquid , methanol overcame an obstacle last year when
it was approved by the US Department of Transportation for use on board
flights . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#134:3>

<p> PolyFuel , one of a handful of start-ups focused on developing fuel cells
for portable devices , demonstrated a hot-swappable , recycleable fuel
cartridge for laptops at the Intel Developers Forum in February .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#135:3>
The fuel cell could give 10 hours of continuous power .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#136:3>
PolyFuel expects to bring the product to market next year . </p>

<h> <bold> Firm hails revolution of 3D heart technology </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#140:4>

<p> An American manufacturer has arrived in Hong Kong to promote new
technology that allows physicians to see a beating human heart as a
transparent , three-dimensional image , saying it could improve patients'
chances of survival . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#141:4>

<p> According to cardiologist Joseph Kisslo , of Duke University Medical
Centre in the United States , the new ultrasound machine can turn average
heart surgeons into world class physicians by helping them diagnose and treat
the disease more efficiently . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#142:4>

<p> Using the machines , which have been in research and development for
about 20 years and cost &dollar;2.3 million each , cardiologists can get a
better view of a heart  ' s valves and chambers and can view the transparent
image from different angles using a computer mouse . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#143:4>

<p> Ultrasound machines , which are non-intrusive , use sounds to create an
image of an internal organ .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#144:4>
Until now , physicians have relied on chest X-rays and
two-dimensional ultrasound machines to diagnose heart disease .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#145:4>
&ldquo; We can bring the best surgery to more people because we
simplify everything , &rdquo; Dr Kisslo said . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#146:4>

<p> &ldquo; Now you get the whole story in just one picture .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#147:4>
It gives a better picture and makes us doctors more equal . &rdquo;
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#148:4>

<p> Philips Medical Systems launched its product in Hong Kong yesterday and
hopes to sell it to both private and public hospitals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#149:4>
It has sold about 100 to hospitals in the US since launching the
machines last November . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#150:4>

<p> Heart disease is the number two cause of death in Hong Kong , behind
cancer , and has been steadily claiming more lives each year . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#151:4>

<p> According to the most recent figures available from the Department of
Health , in the year 2000 about 5,537 people died from heart disease , a rise
from 4,806 in 1997 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-034#152:4>

<p> Dr Kisslo said: &ldquo; Heart disease is clearly on the rise in Hong Kong .
&rdquo; </p>
