<h> <bold> Investors beware </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#2:1>
The Securities and Futures Commission wants to tighten up the
regulations over research done by stock market analysts .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#3:1>
Without giving precise details , it is saying it will watch how other
markets deal with the issue , before deciding what is appropriate in Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#4:1>
The charge sheet some analysts face is that , through poor
research , they inflated a stock market bubble in the late 1990s by
recommending people buy shares in companies which had no prospect of making a
profit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#5:1>
When the stock market bubble burst , the shares collapsed , and
investors were left nursing huge losses .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#6:1>
A more serious charge is that analysts working for big investment
banks actively promoted stocks they knew to be bad , in the hope of gaining
lucrative deals from that company for their employers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#7:1>
Countries around the world are now grappling with how to deal with
this issue .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#8:1>
Ideas that have been floated include ordering banks to separate their
research arms and toughening up the penalties for those found guilty of
market abuse . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#9:1>
All the proposed remedies are worth examining , both in Hong Kong
and elsewhere , but there is something else that is probably more important .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#10:1>
Too many people were too willing to believe that the rules of
economics , particularly as they related to company performance , had been
rewritten .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#11:1>
A firm did not need to be making a profit , or even have a sound
business plan it seemed , it just needed a vague idea about future earnings
and a trendy name . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#12:1>
It wasn't that there were a lack of signals about a bubble in the
making .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#13:1>
It wasn't just Alan Greenspan warning about an &ldquo; irrational
exuberance &rdquo; in share prices .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#14:1>
The frenzied scenes that greeted the Tom.com share offering in early
2000 should have warned investors to beware . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#15:1>
While regulating analysts may be important , investors also need
to look at their own behaviour if they are not to get burned again .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#16:1>
They should look at the hard facts behind a company , look closely at
its quality of management , track record , and future plans .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#17:1>
Don't be taken in by a flash name , or a gimmicky marketing ploy .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#18:1>
And beware what a company says about itself . If a deal looks too
good to be true , it probably is . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#20:2>
US President George W . Bush  ' s administration did not say so ,
but the test-firing of an interceptor rocket from a navy ship in the Pacific
hours after the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty expired was a warning . It was
American defiance speaking , telling China and Russia by actions rather than
words of Washington  ' s military ambitions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#21:2>
The words have not been so blunt to China , but neither have they
been comforting .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#22:2>
Mr Bush says that American defence is his Government  ' s priority and
it will go ahead with building a missile defence shield regardless of
protests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#23:2>
Only last month in Moscow , Mr Bush told Russia  ' s President
Vladimir Putin of US friendship and signed a pact that jointly mothballed
thousands of nuclear warheads . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#24:2>
The US withdrew from the 1972 missile pact to enable construction
of the missile shield .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#25:2>
It claimed the end of the Cold War meant that priorities had changed .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#26:2>
Work begins on the shield today with a ground-breaking ceremony
will be held at Fort Greely in Alaska for silos for six interceptor missiles .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#27:2>
But it is not simply a shield - with missiles pointed across the
Pacific towards China , Russia and North Korea , it is as much a threat as a
deterrent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#28:2>
The ABM Treaty was seen as a key element of global arms control .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#29:2>
Its death opens a new era of uncertainty .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#30:2>
Military experts say China is strengthening its missile defences .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#31:2>
Washington and Beijing have an obligation to not endanger world
security .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#32:2>
They must make an effort to build better relations and resolve
differences rather than create fear . </p>

<h> <bold> Tale of two cities </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#34:3>
Tiny Macau has been dependent on the gaming industry for survival
, but its new ambition is to become a regional convention , entertainment and
gaming centre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#35:3>
After luring international consortiums to set up new hotels ,
casinos and conference facilities , it is also trying to enhance its
attractions by building a few golf courses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#36:3>
But as it can find no suitable sites within its borders , it
wants to build them on Hengqin Island in neighbouring Zhuhai .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#37:3>
To ensure the golf courses become &ldquo; part &rdquo; of Macau , it
has even asked the central Government to allow foreign tourists from the
enclave visa-free access to the island . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#38:3>
That Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah has disclosed the
plan to a delegation of foreign chambers of commerce suggested that it stands
a good chance of being approved by Beijing .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#39:3>
There are in fact precedents for such approvals .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#40:3>
Since 1995 , Shenzhen has benefited by allowing visa-free access for
three-days for foreign tourists entering in groups through Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#41:3>
The flexibility demonstrated by both Macau and Zhuhai in
complementing one another is a shining example of regional co-operation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#42:3>
Zhuhai has even dovetailed with Macau  ' s goal by aiming to become
China  ' s &ldquo; most romantic city" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#43:3>
Perhaps the precarious situation faced by Zhuhai , which is being
weighed down by the financial burden of having to pay for an airport that has
attracted no traffic , means it is receptive to any offers from Macau to
bring in more investment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#44:3>
As two small territories whose significance is dwarfed by Hong
Kong and Shenzhen on the other side of the Pearl River estuary , Macau and
Zhuhai know they must work hand in hand to help one another . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#45:3>
Commentators have pointed to the focused way in which Macau has
set its course compared to Hong Kong  ' s apparent lack of a clear direction .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#46:3>
But that view overlooks the differences between the two Special
Administrative Regions of China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#47:3>
Whereas Macau has a population of just 430,000 and is only 23.8
square kilometres in size , Hong Kong has 6.8 million souls and a land area
of more than 1,000 square kilometres . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#48:3>
It will always be easier to run Macau than Hong Kong , although
both face the same problem of staying ahead of other Chinese cities as the
advantages that they used to enjoy due to their colonial legacies are fast
eroding with China opening up more and more to the outside world . </p>

<h> <bold> Making amends </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#50:4>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung  ' s &ldquo; Sunshine Policy
&rdquo; for peace with the rival North may be on its last legs , but that
does not mean the future is bleak .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#51:4>
In fact , rarely has the prospect for a chance for peace on the
Korean peninsula been so positive . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#52:4>
Key to the new atmosphere is a change of heart by the United
States .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#53:4>
When President George W . Bush took office in January 2001 , years of
progress evaporated .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#54:4>
US-North Korean talks were cancelled and Mr Bush  ' s tough rhetoric
culminated in him naming North Korea among an &ldquo; axis of evil nations" .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#55:4>
Last Thursday , Mr Kim  ' s ruling Millennium Democratic Party was
trounced by the opposition Grand National Party in local government elections .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#56:4>
Although Mr Kim cannot stand for re-election in presidential polls in
October , the result was a pointed reminder that his plan for Korean unity
would die when he left office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#57:4>
But talks the same day between Pyongyang  ' s United Nations
representative and US special envoy in negotiations on North Korea , Jack
Pritchard , brought fresh hope .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#58:4>
There is now talk of Washington sending an envoy to Pyongyang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#59:4>
Shortly after a ground-breaking visit to Pyongyang by Mr Kim  ' s
special envoy , the North  ' s leader Kim Jong-il spoke positively of a
promised visit to Seoul .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#60:4>
Reunions of families split by the Korean War have resumed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#61:4>
There is even a chance of an inter-Korean football match . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#62:4>
The signs are positive , but the US - more than any other nation
- can effect real change .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#63:4>
It is up to Mr Bush and his advisers to diplomatically re-ignite the
process that for 18 months they have so woefully mismanaged . </p>

<h> <bold> Hope on the horizon </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#65:5>
From 4.4 per cent at the end of 2000 , the unemployment rate has
risen to a record high of 7.4 per cent over the past 18 months , with 253,000
people now out of work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#66:5>
With tens of thousands of graduates and school leavers due to
flood the job market this summer , Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa has had to
admit that unemployment might go even higher before it falls . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#67:5>
It did not help that one of Hong Kong  ' s oldest restaurant chains
, the Treasure Restaurant Group , collapsed under a mountain of debt early
this month .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#68:5>
The chain  ' s restaurants used to employ almost 2,000 workers , and
their closure has affected general sentiment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#69:5>
But although it is difficult for anyone to shrug off the gloomy
mood that pervades the community , there are reasons to suggest things are
not as bad as they look . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#70:5>
Although property prices are still sluggish due to a massive
over-supply , an increasing number of people are moving into new homes sold
and financed at attractive rates by developers and banks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#71:5>
And new homes need to be furnished and decorated .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#72:5>
That probably explained why employment in the decoration and
maintenance sector has bucked the trend and shown a real increase . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#73:5>
The latest figures have also revealed that more jobs have been
created in the financial and business services sectors , suggesting that
after almost four years of continuous deflation , these areas are showing
signs of vitality again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#74:5>
Growing job vacancies in these sectors appear to be collaborated
by slight growth in recruitment advertising over the past six months . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#75:5>
Two weeks ago , the Government announced the resumption of the
sale of Home Ownership Scheme flats after a 10-month ban , but at much
reduced numbers .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#76:5>
The reduction should help stabilise the housing market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#77:5>
Although the results of yesterday  ' s land auction could not be
regarded as a definitive indicator that the worst is over , the keen interest
shown by developers at the North Point site suggested they are cautiously
optimistic about the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#78:5>
Two months ago , the Asian Development Bank forecast that Hong
Kong would register 2.1 per cent growth this year , followed by a strong 4.8
per cent in 2003 .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#79:5>
Its forecast was more upbeat than the Government's . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#80:5>
Even if the bank is off target by a margin , Hong Kong should
still record growth this year .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#81:5>
No dramatic developments seem to be on the horizon to cause the bank
and other economists to revise their predictions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#82:5>
Despite the downturn , the balances in people  ' s savings accounts
have continued to grow .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#83:5>
What they lack is the confidence to spend the cash they have hoarded .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#84:5>
Hopefully , confidence will return as rising tourist arrivals and a
stabilising housing market gradually translate into more jobs . </p>

<h> <bold> Aerial objective </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#86:6>
In whose best interests is an expanded air services agreement
with the United States being negotiated ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#87:6>
With SAR officials widely expected to seal a deal in Washington next
week , a furious last-ditch lobbying effort is under way .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#88:6>
The betting is that Cathay Pacific secures its long-planned alliance
with American Airlines , while US cargo carriers win significantly expanded
operating rights from the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#89:6>
For opponents , the SAR Government is giving away too much to
secure a deal that chiefly benefits British-controlled Cathay .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#90:6>
Worse , China  ' s national interests are threatened by throwing open
the SAR cargo-hub market to US freight carriers , argues the China National
Aviation Corp . &obrack;  CNAC &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#91:6>
Air service agreements are always wrapped in national politics
and Hong Kong  ' s situation is complicated by its SAR status within China .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#92:6>
By seeking to impose a pro-China outcome , critics charge CNAC is
undermining Hong Kong  ' s independence under the " one country , two systems
&rdquo; formula . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#93:6>
Such concerns seem unfounded since this spat seems a straight
battle of corporate self-interest .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#94:6>
CNAC  ' s lobbying effort , which has included fiery rhetoric from
Citic Pacific chairman Larry Yung Chi-kin , is little different from US
carriers ' influence-pedalling in Washington .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#95:6>
The test will be whether local officials do a deal which is best for
Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#96:6>
CNAC hopes to develop its 43.3 per cent-held Dragonair
subsidiary as a major Trans-Pacific freight carrier .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#97:6>
Expanding US cargo airlines ' ability to pick up cargo in the SAR and
fly to other destinations threatens that aim .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#98:6>
However , it promises to consolidate Hong Kong  ' s status as a major
air-cargo hub . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#99:6>
We have supported a full opening of all air routes since the
wider economy of Hong Kong has little to lose and much to gain from more
competition , lower fares and consolidation as an air cargo hub .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#100:6>
Singapore has already gone this route . The counter argument that
this leaves Hong Kong little leverage to force an opening of the US domestic
aviation market makes sense from Cathay  ' s perspective but not for the rest
of us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-007#101:6>
We seem likely to have a compromise that offers simplified US
travel through the Cathay-American Airlines code-share agreement , but a
limited increase in competition .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#102:6>
That is not a perfect solution , but a step in the right direction .
Dragonair retains a large market flying cargo to Chek Lap Kok and has
regional expansion plans .

<ICE-HK:W2E-007#103:6>
The main aim must be to get more people and goods flowing through
the SAR . </p>
