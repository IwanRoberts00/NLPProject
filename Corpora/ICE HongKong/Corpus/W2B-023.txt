<p> <#2:1> The combination of modern healthcare and traditional lifestyle has
given Hong Kong people the third-highest life expectancy in the world .
<#3:1> <it> Sherry Lee </it> asks some of the SAR  ' s centenarians about the
secrets of their longevity </p>

<p> <#4:1> <bold> IN 1893 , EMPORER </bold> Guangxu sat on the Chinese throne
, the Qing dynasty still had 18 years to ruin and Sir William Robinson was
the governor of Hong Kong .
<#5:1> It would be five years before Britain and China signed the 99-year
lease on the New Territories .
<#6:1> In this year , the man who would go on to change the history of China
, Mao Zedong , was born .
<#7:1> And so was Cheung Kwai-mui . </p>

<p> <#8:1> Robinson left Hong Kong in 1898 and the lease he helped negotiate
has come and gone .
<#9:1> Mao , of course , went on to lead the Communists to victory in 1949 ,
launch the disastrous Cultural Revolution and died in 1976 .
<#10:1> Cheung is still going strong and remember it all . </p>

<p> <#11:1> Confined to bed in an old people  ' s home since a stroke robbed
her of most of her ability to walk and see , the fragile old woman mumbles in
Hakka when asked how old she is: " Many , many ages . &rdquo; </p>

<p> <#12:1> Cheung is possibly Hong Kong  ' s oldest resident .
<#13:1> Born in Huiyang village in Guangdong province , she came to Hong Kong
in 1979 .
<#14:1> She has two sons and one daughter , 11 grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren .
<#15:1> Out of her seven siblings , only two are still alive - in their 90s
in her home village . </p>

<p> <#16:1> She talks rarely now and when she does her grand-daughter-in-law
, Berry Lee Wan-nog , says it tends to be a rambling collection of memories
about the Communist Revolution and going hungry in her home village , where
she was born into a farming family .
<#17:1> Lee says everyone in her grandmother  ' s remote village in Guangdong  ' s
hills lived long lives , many to more than 90 . But only one reached 109 .
</p>

<p> <#18:1> A few years ago , Cheung moved from her second son  ' s home in Tai
Po to an old people  ' s home near the town  ' s market .
<#19:1> But today , the silver-haired matriarch is in a wheelchair on a
makeshift stage in Tai Po  ' s Kun Lin Wah Restaurant .
<#20:1> Next to her is a relative youngster , Chan Chi , who says he is 102 .
Further along is 101-year-old Lai Yung .
<#21:1> Lai , whose skin is tanned and rough , is hunched over with age but
she is the only one who manages a smile for the cameras as they flash before
her . </p>

<p> <#22:1> Making up this small group of centenarians is a more sprightly
lady with fine , pale skin .
<#23:1> She really shouldn't be here , but her identity card says she is 100
, so she takes her place on the stage .
<#24:1> &ldquo; I  ' m only 89 really , &rdquo; claims Chung Wai-giu .
<#25:1> &ldquo; I lied about my age when I came to Hong Kong to get a job .
&rdquo;
<#26:1> No one seems overly concerned about the apparent oversight . </p>

<p> <#27:1> Every Lunar New Year , the Tai Po Rural Committee organizes the
Chin Shui Yin , or Thousand Ages Feast , in which everyone in the district
aged 73 or older is invited to a reception .
<#28:1> Guests aged 97 or older are presented with a little gold pendant and
the five oldest received a palm-sized one .
<#29:1> This year , only four of the district  ' s 10 centenarians are well
enough to attend .
<#30:1> When everyone is sitting comfortably , one of the event  ' s organizers
starts speaking .
<#31:1> Lai promptly falls asleep .
<#32:1> But then she is a veteran at this function - she already has a
handful of pendants . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> <#36:1> There are officially 808 people who claim to be older than 100 in
Hong Kong - 648 women and 160 men - and account for about one in every 8,000
people in the SAR , government statistics say .
<#37:1> Forty years ago , there were just 12 centenarians and in 1981 , 289 ,
or half as many as there are today in relation to the size of the total
population . </p>

<p> <#38:1> Hong Kong now has the world  ' s third-highest life expectancy ,
according to the recently released United Nations study, <it> Human
Development Report 2001 </it> .
<#39:1> The Japanese are expected to live the longest , with an average life
expectancy of 80.8 years .
<#40:1> Sweden comes next at 79.6 years followed by Hong Kong with 79.4; 77
for males and 82.2 for females . </p>

<p> <#41:1> Many elderly people  ' s lives have changed dramatically over the
years , others have ticked along , barely noticing the modern world . </p>

<p> <#42:1> Lai was born in Sheung Tsuen at the foot of Tai Mo Shan but has
lived most of her life in Shui Wai village in Tai Po .
<#43:1> She says she has never been to Hong Kong Island and has visited
Kowloon only twice .
<#44:1> She has never been on the MTR or the KCR and has seldom taken a trip
by car .
<#45:1> She says she doesn't know what year it is .
<#46:1> &ldquo; I  ' m used to not knowing , I take one day at a time , &rdquo;
Lai says .
<#47:1> I tell her the year .
<#48:1> &ldquo; Oh , really ? &rdquo; she replies , without a care . </p>

<p> <#49:1> Lai never went to school and cannot read or write .
<#50:1> When she recounts her childhood , it is hard to comprehend she is
talking about the first few years of another century .
<#51:1> &ldquo; I looked after the cow from morning to dusk .
<#52:1> I walked to the field and set it free .
<#53:1> I didn't need to call it back .
<#54:1> In the evening , it would come back voluntarily , &rdquo; she recalls .
</p>

<p> <#55:1> At 19 , Lai was married-off to a man 20 years her senior and
moved to Shui Wan where she gave birth to two daughters .
<#56:1> She only saw her husband for the first time on her wedding day , when
he lifted her red veil .
<#57:1> Asked if she liked him , she replies: &ldquo; It doesn't matter if I
liked him or not . &rdquo; </p>

<p> <#58:1> Lai had two daughters .
<#59:1> Her husband died during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from an
unspecified illness .
<#60:1> To support her family , she harvested wild grass for farmers for
&dollar;2 a day and at times laboured as a construction worker . </p>

<p> <#61:1> But it was not always work .
<#62:1> She sometimes returned to visit her parents at her home village ,
always on foot .
<#63:1> As there was no road , &ldquo; I  ' d set off very early in the morning
and walk for hours along paths around mountains , &rdquo; Lai says . </p>

<p> <#64:1> These days , the only way she can get about is with a stick .
<#65:1> Lai still makes her own bed every morning and climbs the stairs to
exercise her legs before going to bed before 10pm .
<#66:1> She is the oldest person in her village and has outlived all her
friends , relatives and even her children .
<#67:1> Two years ago , her daughter died aged 73 , leaving her &ldquo; sad
and lonely" .
<#68:1> Lau adds: &ldquo; I couldn't imagine I would have such a long life ,
&rdquo; and puts it down to a blessing from &ldquo; heaven" . </p>

<p> <#69:1> Medical experts believe improved social conditions , healthcare ,
a healthy lifestyle and a traditional diet of rice , vegetables and little
meat have all helped Hong Kong  ' s elderly to live longer . </p>

<p> <#70:1> An ongoing study of healthy ageing conducted since the early
1990s by the Chinese University  ' s department of community and family
medicine shows most centenarians share a number of characteristics - their
diet , moderate but regular exercise and an early-to-bed , early-to-rise
philosophy .
<#71:1> They also tend to be optimistic and stress free . </p>

<p> <#72:1> According to the <it> Guinness Book of Records </it> , the world  ' s
oldest person is American Maude Ferris-Luse , aged 114 .
<#73:1> The oldest fully authenticated person ever was Jeanne Louise Calment
, who died aged 122 in 1997 .
<#74:1> In Hong Kong , there is no official record of the oldest person .
</p>

<p> <#75:1> Chan Cho-chak , 105 , is sitting on his sofa in his bedroom in
Broadcast Drive , Kowloon Tong , reading his <it> Beneficial To The World
Essays Collection </it> , a compilation of newspaper articles he wrote in the
1960s .
<#76:1> He is talking non-stop and ignores my questions . </p>

<p> <#77:1> &ldquo; This book has everything: relationships , society and
economy , ethnics and general subjects .
<#78:1> Look , it even talks about divorce and care of animals... everything
you can think of , &rdquo; he says softly . </p>

<p> <#79:1> Ignoring me again - I later realise he is virtually deaf - he
flips through the pages of the book and talks about the problems of gambling
, smoking and drugs .
<#80:1> Then he boasts about the long history of China and about Emperor Qin
Shihuang , who ordered a party of virgins under Xu Fu to sail to Japan in a
disastrous quest for an elixir for long life . </p>

<p> <#81:1> Chan then tells me about Sun Yat-sen  ' s revolution , then about
how &ldquo; the British used the Opium Wars to poison Chinese people" .
<#82:1> Suddenly , he  ' s talking about Chinese pirate Cheung Po-tsai , then
world peace . </p>

<p> <#83:1> Born in the year William McKinley became the 25th president of
the United States , Chan was the youngest child of a scholarly family .
<#84:1> He remembers the first lightbulb his family had and the first car in
Hong Kong .
<#85:1> He remembers wearing a long pigtails as a boy and that Sun was his
idol . </p>

<p> <#86:1> Chan worked as a tailor in Guangzhou and studied at night .
<#87:1> When he was a teenager , he volunteered as a revolutionary soldier in
the hope of emulating Sun and marched from Guangxi to Beijing but before he
reached the capital , the enemy won and he had to flee .
<#88:1> In 1917 , he arrived in Hong Kong as a refugee and 14 years later
founded the Chan Kan Woon Department Store .
<#89:1> The business thrived and he opened six branches .
<#90:1> In the 50s , he helped open a free school for girls funded by the Lok
Sin Tong Benevolent Society and devoted his life to charity work .
<#91:1> Last year , he became the oldest person to be named on the SAR  ' s
honours list when he received the Medal of Honour for his service to the
community which included 73 years of charity work with the society . </p>

<p> <#92:1> Apart from using his brain as much as possible , he tells me the
other secret of long life .
<#93:1> &ldquo; Not to have so much sex , &rdquo; he says . </p>

<p> <#94:1> <bold> &ldquo; Yiu Yick-cheung &obrack;  below &cbrack; never lost her temper , I  ' ve
never seen her angry and she never flights with others .
<#95:1> Even if it is other people  ' s fault , she would say sorry &rdquo;
</bold> </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> <#96:1> &ldquo; Then why do you have two wives ? &rdquo; whispers Lin Tse
, a fellow-villager who cares for him .
<#97:1> Chan has nine children , 27 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren
in Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the US and Britain . </p>

<p> <#98:1> Yuk Yick-cheung , 103 , started seeing her friends die during her
50s and by the time she was 90 , she was the last of her circle left .
<#99:1> Last November , her youngest son passed away .
<#100:1> &ldquo; I think I will die before my mother dies , &rdquo; says her
eldest son , Wong Hoi , 76 . </p>

<p> <#101:1> Yiu was born in Xinhui , a Guangdong village where her father
gave her a boy  ' s name , Yick-cheung , as she was the family  ' s only daughter .
<#102:1> Sitting in her armchair , Yiu wears a shimmering purple jacket and
her woolen hat she knitted herself .
<#103:1> When Yiu talks , she sometimes falls asleep . It is difficult to
talk to her , but her son helps . </p>

<p> <#104:1> &ldquo; She asked you how you have had such a long life ,
&rdquo; he says slowly and loudly into her ear .
<#105:1> Yiu hears her son and say &ldquo; I always pray , I have a good
heart and I am careful with food . &rdquo; </p>

<p> <#106:1> Yiu has a simple diet .
<#107:1> She starts the day with cereal and bread; for lunch she eats white
rice , fish , pork and lots of vegetables .
<#108:1> But she makes sure she only eats until she is half-full and avoids
greasy food . After meals , she eats half an orange . </p>

<p> <#109:1> Wong has another explanation for her longevity: his mother grew
up with the comforts of a rich family .
<#110:1> &ldquo; She ate a lot of Chinese delicacies , birds and ginseng when
she was young , &rdquo; he says .
<#111:1> Wong also believes her temperament plays a part .
<#112:1> &ldquo; She is very optimistic , &rdquo; he says .
<#113:1> &ldquo; She never lost her temper , I  ' ve never seen her angry and
she never fights with others .
<#114:1> Even if it is other people  ' s fault , she would say sorry . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> <#115:1> Yiu lost her wealth during the Japanese occupation and came to
Hong Kong in 1947 , where she worked in a garment factory .
<#116:1> Today , she and her son live in a Kwai Hing public-housing estate on
social security .
<#117:1> She can't recognize people in old photographs , including her own
son .
<#118:1> Nor can she recalls dates but she retains vivid memories of her
childhood . </p>

<p> <#119:1> She went to school for a few years when she was small .
<#120:1> &ldquo; Only rich people could study , &rdquo; she says .
<#121:1> &ldquo; We had 10 in a class and people quit after they felt they
learned enough . &rdquo;
<#122:1> Asked what she learned at school , she recites the traditional
rhyming Confucian-like essay, <it> San Zi Jing </it> : &ldquo; <it> Yan zi
cho , saint bui sin </it> &obrack;  At the start , human beings ' nature is kind... ]
&rdquo;
<#123:1> She recites cheerfully , as if she has regained her youth . </p>

<p> <#124:1> Meanwhile , Lai is awake now and on her way home from the
restaurant with her gold pendant .
<#125:1> These days , she takes a taxi .
<#126:1> Holding the handrail and her walker , Lai slowly climbs the stairs
to her second-floor village house . </p>

<p> <#127:1> Has she enjoyed living so long ?
<#128:1> &ldquo; It doesn't matter if I like it or not ' &rdquo; she says .
