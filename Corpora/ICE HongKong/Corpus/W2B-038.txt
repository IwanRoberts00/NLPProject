<bold> Plus! puts some pizazz into XP </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#2:1>
If you are bored with the hills-and clouds interface of Windows XP
, then a copy of Microsoft  ' s latest Plus! package might be for you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#3:1>
The newly released Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition &obrack;  or
Plus! DME &cbrack; , turns Window XP  ' s blue feel into a cool digital-entertainment
platform with mixed results . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#4:1>
The new version of Plus! adds a selection of colours and
customisable features to Windows XP . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#5:1>
One such feature is Photo Story , a video slideshow program that
works like a digital photo album creator .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#6:1>
It runs on top of Windows Media Player 9 , and allows users to add
narration , music , zooming and panning to Jpeg images .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#7:1>
Users can send the finished digital slide show to others by e-mail .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#8:1>
Photo stories are saved as Windows Media Video files and can be
burned to VCDs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#9:1>
The Plus! pack also includes an analogue recorder for converting
old vinyl and tape recordings into compressed Windows Media Audi &obrack;  WMA &cbrack; files .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#10:1>
To use this recording feature , audio cables must be used to connect
the record player to the computer  ' s sound card . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#11:1>
The application then takes control and will record for a
specified period of time , automatically detect and split tracks , reduce
hiss and pop , and allow the user to add title and artist information to each
song . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#12:1>
Plus! DME can also record from microphone input , and no
complaints about the sound quality . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#13:1>
The CD Label Maker let users create and print colourful
customised CD labels , inserts and booklets .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#14:1>
It automatically adds artist , track and album information . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#15:1>
Like its sister software , MovieMaker , which shipped with XP ,
Plus! DME has been fitted with effects , text titles and transitions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#16:1>
Another addition to the suite id Party Mode , a feature that adds
security to a jukebox so that user can view song titles , edit playlists and
add visual effects without getting access to other programs or data on the PC .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#17:1>
Plus! DME has a full-functioned alarm clock that can rouse
people from slumber by playing user-selected tracks from the Media Player .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#18:1>
The software package also includes Sync &ampersand; Go , a feature for
pocket PCs . Content users want updated when they sync their pocket PCs is
chosen from Media Player playlists , and a meagre list of audio and video is
downloaded to their handhelds . Once selected , Sync &ampersand; Go then automatically
synchronises the content . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#19:1>
Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition is available from most
local software retailers for about HK&dollar;160 , great value for anyone
weary of the original XP desktop . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#24:2>
Hong Kong is a city of almost seven million people , but
strangely enough , there are only four domestic free TV channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#25:2>
Like most things in life , if you want more , you  ' ll have to pay for
it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#26:2>
A satellite antenna or an optical cable connected to your television
set will bring you everything from the latest news on the BBC , to mating
games on the Discovery Channel and Powerpuff Girls on the Cartoon Network -
but it  ' s going to cost  ' ya . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#27:2>
<bold> The Underground </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#28:2>
For most people who live in this city , the easiest way to get
your daily does of market news from Bloomberg before heading for work is by
cable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#29:2>
<bold> Cable TV </bold> <it> &obrack;  183-2888; www.wharfcable.com &cbrack; </it> ,
is a subsidiary of the local conglomerate Wharf Holdings , was launched in
1993 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#30:2>
It holds a monopoly on Hong Kong  ' s cable television service and
provides a mix of local programs and international channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#31:2>
Its basic package has 29 channels including AXN , BBC World , CCTV ,
Channel NewsAsia , CNN , Discover , ESPN , MTV and National Geographic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#32:2>
It costs &dollar;600 for installation , plus a monthly fee of
&dollar;298 for the package , and an additional &dollar;30 for an analogue
converter rental &obrack;  the black box that sits on top of the TV &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#33:2>
They also provide several other packages to accommodate everyone  ' s
viewing needs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#34:2>
The Zee Pack &obrack;  &dollar;248/month &cbrack; offers four Indian channels - Zee
TV , Zee News , Zee Cinema , Zee Music; the International Pack &obrack; 
&dollar;168/month &cbrack; has five channels including NHK World Premium from Japan ,
<foreign> Arirang </foreign> TV form Korea , TV5 from France , <foreign>
Deutsche Welle </foreign> from Germany and TVE from Spain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#35:2>
There  ' s also a &ldquo; porn pack , &rdquo; or what they discretely
call the CAT6 Pack &obrack;  &dollar;198 &cbrack; which brings you 10 channels of adult
entertainment from around the world . Lastly you can add premium channels to
your service , including HBO &obrack;  &dollar;80 &cbrack; , Cinemax &obrack;  &dollar;80 &cbrack; and Star
Movies &obrack;  &dollar;80 &cbrack; . </p> <O> A Picture </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#36:2>
<bold> In the Air </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#37:2>
For those who live in the more remote parts of the city , in
apartments older than your average Chinese politician , or in buildings that
don't have an in-built network , Cable TV also provides another service
called the <bold> Cable Express </bold> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#38:2>
This broadcasts by microwave and requires the installation of a dish
antenna &obrack;  approximately 10 inches in diameter &cbrack; , and a decoder for you to
receive the channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#39:2>
Before installation , however , Cable Express will have to send a
site engineer to your house &obrack;  free of charge &cbrack; to check out whether or not
their signal can reach you area .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#40:2>
If he gives you the go-ahead , you  ' ll be shelling out between
&dollar;2,0900-&dollar;6,000 for the installation . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#41:2>
<bold> Outer Space </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#42:2>
To get the most out of your remote , you  ' ll want to go with
satellite TV because it offers the most channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#43:2>
You might be surprised to know that installing your own satellite
antenna and receiving unencrypted TV channels flowing in the air &obrack;  i.e .
CCTV &cbrack; is actually legal - provided it  ' s only for private use and only in one
household .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#44:2>
You should also know , however , that satellite reception is
restricted to places where there is a clear sky view . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#45:2>
For most of us who live in multi-story buildings , the best and
cheapest way to receive satellite TV programs is to get all the residents of
your building or the property owners to agree on installing one single
satellite master antenna television &obrack;  SMATV &cbrack; system to serve the whole
building .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#46:2>
A SMATV system typically consists of one of more satellite receiving
dish antennas installed on the rooftop of a building .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#47:2>
The signals received by these antennas are distributed by cable to
individual households within the building . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#48:2>
The system can only be installed , maintained and operated by
companies holding a SMATV license issued by the <bold> Office of the
Telecommunications Authority </bold> <it> &obrack;  29/F , Wu Chung House , 213 Queen  ' s
Road East , Wanchai , www.ofta.gov.hk &cbrack; </it> , where you can find a list of
these 73 companies and their quoted rates .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#49:2>
One of the licensees , <bold> PCCW </bold> <it> &obrack;  ask for Mr . Lee at
2577-9211 or po-leung.lee@pccw.com &cbrack; </it> , charges &dollar;20,000 to
&dollar;100,000 for installing the system including foundation design and
equipment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#50:2>
If you  ' re one of the luck few with a house and garden , <bold>
Intro-Tech Technology Ltd . </bold> <it> &obrack;  2544-8328; www.introtech.com.hk)
</it> offers a Direct-to-Home &obrack;  DTH &cbrack; installation package of &dollar;12,800
which includes equipment , a one-year warranty , and a selection of 40
channels including BBC , Japan BS , Thaicom UBC and more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#51:2>
One of the domestic pay-television program service providers ,
<bold> TV Plus &obrack;  HK &cbrack; Corp . Ltd . </bold> <it> &obrack;  2723-2829 ,
www.tvplus.com.hk &cbrack; </it> , also provides DTH satellite service with one
Japanese &obrack;  JET TV &cbrack; and nine Taiwanese channels .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#52:2>
And with their 45-centimeter dish antenna , you can easily install it
on your balcony or hang it on the outside wall of your building &obrack;  but you
need permission from your landlord &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#53:2>
The installation fee is &dollar;900 , and there is a &dollar;59
monthly service charge , as well as a &dollar;30 monthly rental fee for the
antenna , the decoder box and a smartcard &obrack;  you can also buy the equipment
for &dollar;900 &cbrack; . </p>

Mobile Madness </h> <O> A Picture </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#57:3>
For some , acquiring the next generation of cell is an obsession .
Sherry Lee meets the mobile maniacs who can't stand being one model behind
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#58:3>
<bold> CHIU CHI-WAI </bold> has an expensive habit .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#59:3>
His first of many " hits &rdquo; took place in 1993; then they came
at eight-month intervals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#60:3>
Soon they were as regular as every three months .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#61:3>
Now they may happen once a week . His drug of choice ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#62:3>
Mobile phones . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#63:3>
&ldquo; I am addicted , &rdquo; he acknowledges , laughing about
his tendency to trade in his most recent purchase simply to buy the latest on
the market .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#64:3>
But he is less blithe in admitting his mobile-phone mania means he
has had to go home to his wife and parents broke on pay day , or is in debt
to his family . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#65:3>
The 28-year-old decorator says he can't help but ditch his old
phone when a new model comes out , even though he realises the changes are
sometimes incremental; a blue screen &obrack;  instead of a colourless one &cbrack; , say ,
or a 2mm difference in size .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#66:3>
He is sometimes also pulled in by ads .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#67:3>
If he likes the movie star featured in a movie-phone campaign , for
instance , he must have the product . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#68:3>
Chiu is not alone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#69:3>
He is part of a growing group of people in Hong Kong whose phones
change with the seasons .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#70:3>
According to Smartone executive director Patrick Chan Kai-ling , the
average time mobile-phone users keep their handsets has fallen from 18 months
last year to nine to 12 months now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#71:3>
That is twice as fast as in the mid-1990s , when the replacement
rate was roughly once every two years , says Jeanette Tan Ai-lin , events and
public-relations manager for Motorola Asia Pacific .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#72:3>
Mobile-phone salespeople have not only noticed the trend , but are
hoping it continues .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#73:3>
&ldquo; Whenever a new model comes out , people flock in to trade in
their old ones , &rdquo; says Michael Wong of the Causeway Bay branch of
Broadway .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#74:3>
The salesman says that up to 60 per cent of customers trade in their
phones every six months , while some do so as frequently as every two weeks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#75:3>
Among those who upgrade at least twice a year are the friends of
university student Vincent Luk Wing-hei .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#76:3>
The 21-year-old says about eight of them change mobiles every three
to six months , including a 17-year-old From Five student who buys the
handsets with his pocket money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#77:3>
It is an affordable habit , Luk says , explaining that they don't go
for the high-end models , paying about &dollar;600 per new phone every months .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#78:3>
&ldquo; That  ' s just &dollar;100 a month , &rdquo; he reasons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#79:3>
According to the Office of Telecommunications Authority , there
are 602 million mobile phones users in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#80:3>
The office does not track the number of &ldquo; handset switchers" ,
however , nor does it have a profile of this group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#81:3>
But Chan says Chiu and Luk are typical of most phone and mad
switchers , who are generally in the trend-conscious 20- to 40-year-old age
bracket .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#82:3>
The trend first appeared in Hong Kong about three years ago , Wong
says , as mobiles became palm-sized .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#83:3>
Other factors feeding the phone-swap mania include providers to
customers buying new handsets , the increased convenience of trading in
mobile phones , and the rise in choice of products and lower prices that have
tailed the scores of new brands entering the market .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#84:3>
Hong Kong  ' s mobile-phone penetration rate is among the highest in
the world , says Smartone &obrack;  which declines to reveal what happens to the old
phones that are traded in &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#85:3>
As in other parts of Asia , such as Taiwan &obrack;  where the replacement
rate is 18 months &cbrack; and Singapore &obrack;  two years &cbrack; , says Tan , there  ' s also the
attraction of young consumers to new technology and style .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#86:3>
Chan adds that phone markers have made an effort to turn mobiles from
simply communication tools to &ldquo; trendy fashion items &rdquo; sporting
an increasing number of bells and whistles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#87:3>
Apart from their basic function , mobile phones now take and send
photos and can be used for e-mails and games .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#88:3>
There are also hybrid personal digital assistant/mobile phones known
as smart phones , which allow Internet access . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#89:3>
&ldquo; Consumers are rational and smart , &rdquo; says Emily
Hung Wai-yi , assistant marketing manager of Nokia Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#90:3>
&ldquo; We just give them choices and they make a decision based on
their needs . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#91:3>
Tan agrees , adding that to survive against fierce competition ,
companies have to launch new products regularly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#92:3>
But it is an endless cycle for both manufacturers and consumers of
keeping up with the Joneses ,

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#93:3>
&ldquo; On average , Asians replace handsets more often than any
other region in the world , &rdquo; Tan says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#94:3>
Peter Leung Shou-chi , for instance , has owned 500 to date .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#95:3>
&ldquo; Sometimes I buy three phones in a day , costing me
&dollar;10,000.

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#96:3>
My record is 20 phones in a month . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#97:3>
Why does the South China Athletics Association executive director
do it ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#98:3>
&ldquo; I like mobile phone , &rdquo; the 49-year-old says simply ,
adding that he gives away his old phones and pointing out that many of his
staff have a similar passion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#99:3>
Historian Robert Ferguson says &ldquo; mobile phones are not our
city  ' s only technological style statement" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#100:3>
The assistant professor at Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology  ' s Social Science department , who has studied the history of
technology , says Hong Kong people &ldquo; also pay close attention to trends
in wrist-watches , and they maintain their cars in sparkling condition" .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#101:3>
What lies beneath this urge to replace new phones ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#102:3>
&ldquo; It reflects people  ' s lack of self-confidence that they have
to use a phone to show what they  ' re worth .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#103:3>
It also reflects the emptiness in the lives of our young
generation,: says psychiatrist Chan Chung-mau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#104:3>
" They chase material things to fill in their emotional void , to
show off . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#105:3>
Chiu acknowledges he loves being the first of his friends to have
the latest mobile phone .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#106:3>
" Whenever my friends have new handsets , I feel embarrassed to use
mine , &rdquo; he says , adding that a 24-year-old curtain-maker friend
changes his mobile very three to four months to play new games downloaded
from Web sites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#107:3>
He adds that buying the phones gives him a sense of satisfaction .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#108:3>
&ldquo; With a new handset , I feel like I  ' m wearing a new set of
clothes , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#109:3>
&ldquo; I feel cool and trendy . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#110:3>
Estimating he spends 30-40 per cent of his annual
&dollar;120,000 income on mobile phones , he admits he has lost count of the
number of mobiles he  ' s owned - though he reckon it  ' s about 20 , since his
first in 1993 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#111:3>
But he has committed his favourites to memory: Motorola 801 ,
Ericsson 337 and 388 , Nokia 6150 , Siemens C3 , and so on , which he has
traded in for &dollar;800 to &dollar;2000 at shops in Mongkok , on top of
which he pays &dollar;1,300 to &dollar;1,500 for something new . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#112:3>
He parades the fact that his family , too , changes phones
regularly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#113:3>
While his father is content to use &ldquo; old &rdquo; phones given
to him , his mother purchases a new handset every three to four months and
his wide - who was not interested in mobile phone before their marriage last
year - now likes having a new one from &ldquo; time to time" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#114:3>
Should there be curbs on such behaviour ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#115:3>
As long as the practice does not affect users ' daily life - causing
fights or leading to debt - Chan sees no reason for them to kick the habit
while Ferguson says critics should realise it is just a way for people to
express themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#116:3>
By using a particular type of phone , he sys , people establish
their individuality and gain membership to &ldquo; <foreign> avant-grade
</foreign> &ldquo; circles and tastes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-038#117:3>
With the economic downturn eating into his income , Chiu says he
is cutting back on his phone-related spending .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#118:3>
But then he spots an ad in a newspaper announcing Nokia  ' s 7250
purple digital camera phone , which is marginally smaller than his present
device .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#119:3>
Suddenly the black Nokia 8310 he bought during Lunar New Year is not
good enough .

<ICE-HK:W2B-038#120:3>
" I will buy the new model next month , &rdquo; he declares . </p>
