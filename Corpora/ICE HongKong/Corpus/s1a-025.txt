But uh maybe after nineteen ninety-seven if people find that Hong

It  ' s a very difficult </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#258:1:A>
To get a general conclusion because

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X259:1:Z>
From a from an English perspective <,,> people here can be very

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#260:1:B>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X261:1:Z>

<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<[> Just </[> </{> the culture is different

<,> on an English view <,> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X265:1:Z>
English stand in lines <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> for everything <{3>
<[3> <unc> two words </unc> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X266:1:Z>
They  ' re the you know the world  ' s greatest <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>
for lining up </X>

<$B> <[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#267:1:B>
Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X273:1:Z>
So when people don't line up <{1> <[1> it </[1> you know it it  ' s
desperately annoying <{2> <[2> but <,> </[2> it  ' s <,> it  ' s not the way
people behave here so <,>

And I think that seeing a place as <,> as being dirty <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X358:1:Z>
I mean I think that  ' s very narrow <,> narrow view of <,> Asia

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X359:1:Z>
There  ' s a lot of more interesting things to say about the
country than the fact that it  ' s dirty

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X360:1:Z>
I mean India

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X361:1:Z>
India was dirty

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X362:1:Z>
India is dusty <,,> but <,> not full of plastic <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> because <mention> A </mention> they don't use plastic and tin cans <,>
and <mention> B </mention> if they did use them they will be somebody
recycling and <{2> <[2> make </[2> money that you know that there  ' ll be poor
person who can use this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X363:1:Z>
So <,> I mean we  ' re just <,> we had our holiday in Sri Lanka
again because we just like it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X364:1:Z>

<unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X365:1:Z>
But she said the same as us <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X366:1:Z>
It  ' s dusty <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> but it  ' s not dirty <{5> <[5> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X367:1:Z>

You need to you know it  ' s untidy but our people are famous of
the fact they  ' re not so clean either

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X397:1:Z>
So it  ' s a bit silly <,> I mean Hong Kong is very polluted
<unc> three words </unc> dirty </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#398:1:B>
Uhm uhm <&> inaudible speech </&>

I like to see the uh <,> British styles uh <,> buildings but uhm
it  ' s very wet <,>

Very cold yes <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#415:1:B>
And </[1> but the streets are very clean <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#416:1:B>
Much better than Hong Kong <,> uh the people I don't have much
<{2> <[2> feelings about the people </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#417:1:C>
<[1> How how about <unc> two words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X418:1:Z>
<[2> Lots of lots lots of </[2> </{2> people are quite rude so
<,> you know as much as I say people here are rude

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X419:1:Z>
They are rude in the same way </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#420:1:B>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X421:1:Z>
And in fact very <,> very distant <,> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X422:1:Z>
They never say hello to shopkeepers <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X423:1:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> </[1> in a small town <,> people
would say hello to the <{2> <[2> shopkeeper </[2> you know which is <&>
inaudible speech </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#424:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1>

<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#427:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X428:1:Z>
It  ' s very anonymous

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X429:1:Z>
It  ' s not really <&> inaudible speech </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#430:1:A>
Is it uh do you mean that uhm English uhm people uhm in
living in <.> Eng </.> uh London uhm <,> think that they are more superior or

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X431:1:Z>
Not really I mean <,> <{> <[> I don't <,> </[> I don't think it  ' s
superior

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X432:1:Z>
I think London <,> London is a community of people <,> made up of

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#433:1:B>
<[> That  ' s the culture </[> </{>

<[> You </[> </{> have to work

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X437:1:Z>
I mean people like <&> inaudible speech </&> ever <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X438:1:Z>
There are </[1> some people <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> doing that
<unc> one word </unc> but the majority of people are just <unc>
one word </unc> I mean Adam has lived and worked in London and I have
lived and worked in London </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#439:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#441:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X442:1:Z>
But neither of us have ever considered living and working there
for for the rest of our lives <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X443:1:Z>
And I think that  ' s the main <,> main problem that no there  ' s no
uhm there  ' s no neighbourhood </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#444:1:B>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X445:1:Z>
Because uh because there  ' re so many people who are <,>
foreigners in the neighbourhood <{> <[> just </[> other people from other

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#446:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#447:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#448:1:B>
Oh in this way uh <,> Hong Kong has a similar <,> uh <{1>
<[1> type </[1> be because people are moving around all the time <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> and a lot of new <,> people come <,> who live next to uh next to
you but you don't know who he is <{3> <[3> or who </[3> she is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X449:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X450:1:Z>
<[2> That  ' s right </[2> </{2>

<[3> That  ' s right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X452:1:Z>
That  ' s right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#453:1:A>
I don't know my neighbourhood <&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X455:1:Z>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X456:1:Z>
Do you know the people who live next door </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#457:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#458:1:A>
No <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#459:1:A>
No we we even don't say hello to each other

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X460:1:Z>
Right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X461:1:Z>
Yeah I mean in London I lived <,> there was a house with <,>
three flats <,> and we say hello to our neighbours but nothing else </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#462:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X463:1:Z>
And our immediate neighbours mainly because they were of similar
age <{> <[> <,> </[> that we <unc> one word </unc> we were familiar

find that this uhm statement is not <,> quite

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#466:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X470:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#471:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X472:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X473:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X475:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#476:1:C>

<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X478:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#480:1:A>
<{> <[> But I I just </[> found that uh my neighbourhood

But I think in some new housing estate there is the residents
are always the <,> the same generation

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#527:1:C>
For example for the uh small family maybe uh the neighbourhood
have uh have some children <{1> <[1> there is </[1> <{2> <[2> three words

Maybe mothers and small children tend to know other mothers <,>
with small children </X> <&> inaudible speech by different speakers </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#532:1:B>
Even even though I uh I haven't <,> even though a a boy

uh play with them not like uh in the public housing area we can run uh in the

We cannot because the corridors are so short and so narrow

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-025#574:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-025#X575:1:Z>
