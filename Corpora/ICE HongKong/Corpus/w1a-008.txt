<h> <bold> Work and Family </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#2:1>
<p> There are a close and indispensable linkage between work and family in
our lives .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#3:1>
In this paper , we attempt to discuss the work role together with
family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#4:1>
As we are deeply interested in looking into the gender inequality in
work and family , so heavy emphasis will be placed on the role played by male
and female in workplace as well as family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#5:1>
Generally speaking , people today stress in the equality between both
sexes in the sense that they opposed to the male domination in work and
double role played by women .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#6:1>
They tried hard to abolish the traditional view and re-establish a set
of new value .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#7:1>
However , even though the society is changing and becomes more and
more fair and equal , sexual inequality does exist in work and family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#8:1>
So besides male occupational supremacy and female double role , we are
also concern to trend of the changing society towards this two sexes in both
areas .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#9:1>
Before the discussion of work role , we should know what work is .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#10:1>
<p> Work is one of the crucial social roles preformed by people in any
society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#11:1>
Although the structure and nature of work vary immensely within and
between societies over time , production through work remains principal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#12:1>
In a discussion of the meaning of work for individual , Fox suggested
that there are two great alternative meaning .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#13:1>
Work may be an activity of main importance to his personality and
life fulfillment , or it may be little more than a tiresome necessity in
acquiring the resource for survival .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#14:1>
In addition , work has been taken on a broader meaning to individual
and society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#15:1>
That means , the performance of a work role is also a source of
social integration .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#16:1>
Studied of retirement and unemployment showed that loss of the work
role creates difficulties for some people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#17:1>
They may no longer feel part of society in general and may also lose
social contacts , and a sense of accomplishments .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#18:1>
As a matter of fact that people in different social classes have
similar values regarding the importance of being able to work and the desire
to have a worthwhile and productive job .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#19:1>
On the contrary , welfare as a desirable alternative to work is
consistently rejected .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#20:1>
The materials and symbolic value of success and achievement have
intensified the significance of work role .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#21:1>
In other words , success and achievement in the occupational sphere
are considered as a form of personal worth . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#22:1>
<p> From above , we know that work is regarded as a method of life
fulfillment , a way for survival or a source of social integration .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#23:1>
However , in tradition , work is the primary job of men only .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#24:1>
He is the sole provider in the family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#25:1>
According to Webster  ' s definition , a good provider is one who
provides food , clothing , etc. for his family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#26:1>
More simply , he could be defined as a man whose wife did not have to
enter the labour force .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#27:1>
So , we can see that work seems to be a matter of men while the main
role of women is to make invisible contribution-housework , child care and
the support of their husband  ' s careers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#28:1>
This sexual division of labour in work sphere and family , in fact ,
lead to a great deal of problems which are worthwhile to be discussed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#29:1>
In the first place , we want to raise a question : if work is mainly
defined as a source of life fulfillment , is it unfair to women that they
cannot have these fulfillment derived from work ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#30:1>
On the other hand , provided that work is no more than a way of
survival , in return , whether it is an inequality that men should be the
breadwinner of the family solely </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#31:1>
<p> It goes without saying , owing to the sexual segregation of work-men
being the breadwinner while women as a housekeeper , many people think that
it is unfair to men because they are expected to work during the adult years
from the ends of schooling until retirement .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#32:1>
They are expected to be major providers for their family by providing
their wives and children with an adequate standard of living .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#33:1>
Men with unstable , low-paying jobs find it almost impossible to
maintain satisfactory family lives .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#34:1>
When men do not provide sufficient resources for their family , the
family relationship suffer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#35:1>
The problems derived from the lack of financial resource and the
failure of the men to meet strong normative expectation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#36:1>
So , although there is a long history of men having great authority
and higher status , they own them are not without cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#37:1>
Every man in society does face with a huge pressure inevitably . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#38:1>
<p> However , have we thought that it is an inequality to women ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#39:1>
The role of housekeeper deprived them of many rights and privilege by
placing them in a peculiarly vulnerable position .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#40:1>
Because she was not paid for her contribution to family in either
products or services , a wife was limited to a considerable extent of her
access to money markets .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#41:1>
By discouraging labour force participation , it deprived many women ,
especially affluent ones , of opportunities to achieve interest , strength
and competence .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#42:1>
It deterred young women from acquiring productive skills .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#43:1>
It <-> dettered </-> <+> deterred </+> young women from acquiring
productive skills resulting in women ! ! dependent on men .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#44:1>
Once their husband leave them , they would suffer <-> frim </-> <+>
from </+> serious financial problem by reasons of the lack of productive
skills .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#45:1>
Worse still , the long period of loss of contact with society and
people , they become ignorant and are hard to adapt a new environment and
acquire a technical skill in an ever-changing society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#46:1>
But the most significant matter is that , for those women who have to
stay at home as caregivers and housekeepers , this sexual division of labors
limit and restrict the choice of women .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#47:1>
By the same token , unlike men who can often choose between work and
leisure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#48:1>
They are bond to no choice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#49:1>
But to serve her husband and family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#50:1>
Even though women can handle both work and family , the choice are
just between work and family , instead of choosing leisure . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#51:1>
<p> Now , we are going to discuss the problem of why society always imprison
that work is the primary role of men .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#52:1>
Actually , the good provider as a specialized male role seems to have
arisen in the transition from subsistence to market economies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#53:1>
Undeniably , men are physically stronger than women .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#54:1>
It is believed that they are more capable to take up difficult jobs
such as hunting and mining which are more energy consuming .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#55:1>
In addition to this , the traditional thought of large family result
in the male dominance in work as well .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#56:1>
From the very beginning , the idea of large family was very
prevailing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#57:1>
Women were always busy with reproduction by virtue of the great
demand for labour force in their own farms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#58:1>
Thereby , they should stay at home and are responsible to reproduce
and take care their children .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#59:1>
Consequently , the role of provider fall over men .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#60:1>
By now , more and more women participate in work , but the truth is
that , many people still think men are more rational and thinking , they seem
to be more able to do the higher position job .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#61:1>
In our society , men sometimes if not most monopolized the upper rank
occupation , such as president , doctor , accountant and manager , leaving
the lower rank job to women such as clerk , secretary and assistant . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#62:1>
<p> In fact , male occupational supremacy is more than a norm in most
societies in the sense that it is a typical pattern of family and work
organization also an ideology , a system of believe which is extremely
influential in forming images of hoe work and family life ought to be
organized .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#63:1>
Also , it is norm for wives to shape their labour participation to
the demands of husbands  '  employment and family commitments .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#64:1>
On closer examination , this norm of male dominance in work is
actually rooted from socialization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#65:1>
Manhood is earned or proven through an ideology that glorifies powers
, toughness , assertiveness , bravery and independence .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#66:1>
Brannon &obrack; 1985 &cbrack; identified four dimensions of
masculinity consistent with this ideology : not being feminine &semi; being
respected and admired for successful achievement &semi; never showing
uncertainty or weakness &semi; and seeking adventure and risks , including
the acceptance of violence if necessary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#67:1>
This ideology requires men to see themselves as highly independent
and self-sufficient .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#68:1>
However , as a matter of fact that dependence is experienced by all
human being , not only women and is a healthy , adaptive and positive aspect
of human development .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#69:1>
But female emotional dependence on men was purposely exaggerated to
imprison men  ' s normal dependency on women .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#70:1>
Whereas , still today , many women are socialized to believe that
being partnered or married is a first priority in life and achieving
financial independence and career recognition come to secondary to their
roles .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#71:1>
Consistent with this gender stereotype , a report indicated that
classroom teachers give significantly more attention and esteem-building
encouragement to boys than girls , that images of women as contributors to
knowledge still are or ignored in textbooks and classroom activities . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#72:1>
<p> What is more , men  ' s desire to exclude women in order to keep their own
wages up leads to male-occupational supremacy , too .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#73:1>
As all we know , contrary to the stereotype , cognitive abilities of
both women and men are higher similar &obrack; Fausto-Sterling , 1985
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#74:1>
There is also evidence that women perform better than men in college
as reflected in higher grades in their major field and taking less time to
complete their degree &obrack; U.S. Department of Education , 1991 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#75:1>
So , women , in fact , are capable to compete with make in work .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#76:1>
However , men always consciously monopolized in workplace and
restricted the entry of women into their working world leading to higher
degree of occupational segregation in sex , with female concentrate in lower
paying and lower status occupation while men occupied the higher ranking and
higher standing jobs .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#77:1>
Surprisingly , due to the socialization again , women seldom show
their refused and disagreement .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#78:1>
Women not only play down their intellectual ability and their
professional ambition but to emphasize their physical beauty and
attractiveness as well in order to attract men , which in turn require that
they somehow subordinate themselves to men .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#79:1>
These behaviour serves to protect men from the fact that these women
may be smarter or more capable than men and to protect women form the
rejection brought by men .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#80:1>
It is not surprising that wives of professional and managers ,
instead of working out , often assists their husband career by performing all
household task to allow husband more time for work .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#81:1>
This explains why male have some advantages to develop their career .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#82:1>
<p> There are a great deal of evidence showing the male occupational
supremacy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#83:1>
We can easily to hear that there is unequal paid between men and
women even though they have same qualification and experience .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#84:1>
Moreover , unequal promotion opportunities is not uncommon as well .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#85:1>
Chances for men to promote a higher position and higher status job is
far greater than that of the women .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#86:1>
Why should women often be forced to do low status or serving job ?
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#87:1>
<p> However , the most worst is that sexual harassment which refers to the
unwanted imposition of sexual requirement in the context of unequal power ,
happen everywhere Many men hold an unconscious view that they are superior to
women and that women should accommodate to men  ' s need .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#88:1>
The unwanted touching , behavior and attitudes scar women and create
a disadvantageous environment to develop their career .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#89:1>
On number of occasion , they show that women are willing to give way
for men to be major breadwinner or provider .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#90:1>
For instance , women always do not negotiate with their husband about
the financial dominance and privilege because they fear losing the
relationship or feel less competent and assured than the male partner .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#91:1>
Therefore , wives always subordinate their career desires to their
partner  ' s plan and aspirations .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#92:1>
A finding reveals that number of women narrowed their professional
and personal options once they had a boyfriend . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#93:1>
<p> This finding fit with those of other <-> researchers  '  </-> <+>
researchers </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#94:1>
They said that a talented women who decided to forge her last year of
college to join her boyfriend who was graduating and moving to another city :

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#95:1>
<it> I can finish my degree at any time so why I risk the
relationship </it> ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#96:1>
Another show how easy it was for a young women decide to marry after
completing advanced degree . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#97:1>
<p> According to the above evidence , we find that women usually are under
men  ' s control in working sphere .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#98:1>
Then how about the role taking of women in family ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#99:1>
Would it be the same as that at work ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#100:1>
In reality , we find that inequality do occur in division of
domestic labour between husband and wife , women do housework as and
sometimes husband help to do &ldquo; their &rdquo; work .

<ICE-HK:W1A-008#101:1>
If there is a division of labour , men act as breadwinner whereas
women become the housekeeper , then what force women take up outside job too ?
