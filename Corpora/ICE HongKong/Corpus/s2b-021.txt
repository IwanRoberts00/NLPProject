The Chairman of the United States Federal Communications
Commission recently said there are thousands of buildings in America with
millions of people in them who have no telephones no cable television and no
reasonable prospect of broad brand services <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#2:1:A>
They are called schools <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#3:1:A>
Even in the most technically advanced country in the world there can
be shortfalls in high-tech vision

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#4:1:A>
How do we stand in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#5:1:A>
In the past <,> individuals or governments could afford to wait for new
development <,> analyze it <,> assess it <,> and take appropriate action <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#6:1:A>
Not anymore <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#7:1:A>
Today things change so quickly that people or authorities without
vision will be taken unawares and left behind <,> and it's getting worse <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#8:1:A>
Look at the mistakes I have met since I have been in Legco <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#9:1:A>
The government signed a contract for international telephone traffic
for twenty-five years against the advice of their engineers at the time

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#10:1:A>
Now they are in a terrible mess and according to the policy
commitment <,> trying to re-negotiate the terms

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#11:1:A>
Good luck to them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#12:1:A>
Only about a year ago <,> the police raided several internet providers
<,> without the faintest idea what they were doing technologically <,> cutting
several hundred subscribers off the net <,> <?> until </?> and interrupting essential
business

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#13:1:A>
The Constitutional Affair branch paid over two and a half million
dollars to a consultant <,> to look into computerizing the voting in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#14:1:A>
The consultant apparently got away with errors in excess of hundred
sixty million dollars in his estimates <,> rendering the consultancy virtually
useless

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#15:1:A>
The reason <,> as <.> fa </.> as far as I can gather <,> lay in the terms
of reference he was given <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#16:1:A>
Transport branch allow tunnel companies to install incompatible
auto toll systems <,> greatly inhibiting the extension of the scheme

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#17:1:A>
Security branch allow the various emergency services to purchase
incompatible communication equipment <,> greatly inhibiting the rescue operation
in the Pak Sin Range <.> fir </.> hill fire disaster <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#18:1:A>
In nineteen ninety-two Education branch adopted a commitment to
provide a computer for every secondary student studying information
technology

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#19:1:A>
I hope this was not just a one-time investment in computers <,> with
not enough follow-up fundings to maintain and upgrade them <,> buy software and
make the necessary changes to teaching methods

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#20:1:A>
In any case <,> today it is not enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#21:1:A>
If you are twenty-five today and not comfortable with computers <,> you
risk being ineffective in almost any kind of work you pursue <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#22:1:A>
So what about all those students who are not studying information
technology <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#23:1:A>
Police branches concerned with information have failed to reach a
definitive conclusion on extent to which information channels are common
carriers <,> without responsibility for their content <,> or publishers who complete
and in the case of internet and video on demand quite unrealistic
responsibility <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#24:1:A>
As a result <,> policy is uncertain and unstable

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#25:1:A>
Recently Planning branch concluded a survey on shopping habits <,> just
before shopping on internet becomes established and changes it all

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#26:1:A>
In some of these cases <,> government are taking belated action to try
and rectify the shortcomings

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#27:1:A>
In future that won't do

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#28:1:A>
Then they will never catch up with reality

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#29:1:A>
So let's have a look at some of the developments our Policy
branches should be looking at

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#30:1:A>
Take education

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#31:1:A>
With the astronomical increase in information it's no longer viable
to base education on the teaching effects <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#32:1:A>
Instead <,> Education branch should be focusing on teaching problem
solving <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#33:1:A>
Trade and Industry should be well advanced on regulating business
on the internet

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#34:1:A>
The Housing Authority should be updating housing design <,> to
accommodate people who may be required to work at home or in communal working
facilities on the estates <,> so called tele-workers

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#35:1:A>
Planning branch should be considering the implications of the
defocusing of national boundaries caused by developing communications
technology <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#36:1:A>
Culture branch should be analyzing the likely effect of our
becoming part of a global community <,> with an international cultural superstructure

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#37:1:A>
Should we be taking action to protect our Asian culture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#38:1:A>
Finance branch should be taking into account the existence of tax
calculations in data form <,> held by almost all companies and many <.> invi </.>
individuals <,> to supersede the complex and time-consuming forms they all have
to fill in irrespective of whether they are computerized or not <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#39:1:A>
Economic services should be examining the extent to which universal
service should be provided for the public beyond the few basic utilities so
governed today <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#40:1:A>
Should Cable TV or broad brand internet <,> be equally available to all

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#41:1:A>
This branch should also be <.> co </.> cooperating with
broadcasting and planning branches to resolve the conflict between common
carriers and publishing

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#42:1:A>
What is needed is a rating standard that can be adopted or not by
providers <,> with PC software that can block material not rated <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#43:1:A>
This would overcome most of the licensing dilemma

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#44:1:A>
Works branch and probably others <,> should be pursuing tendering
on-line to optimize international bidding

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#45:1:A>
Security branch should be promoting public cryptography <,>
and making optimum use of cheap video data recording in the
prevention of crime

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#46:1:A>
Constitutional Affair branch should be studying the political
effect of readily available inexpensive referenda <,> at the command of any
legislator <,> and be deciding on the dividing line between reasonable direct
consultation of the people <,> and full-blown direct
public intervention of virtually every legislative process <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#47:1:A>
All the developments I have just referred to <,> will come to pass <,>
during the term of office of SAR Chief Executive-elect Mr Tung Chee Hwa <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#48:1:A>
Thank goodness he was trained as an engineer <,> and will appreciate the
impact of technology on his administration <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#49:1:A>
Now perhaps for the first time our government will have an
opportunity to come to grips with high technology <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#50:1:A>
I hope they will create the necessary think-tanks and support
groups to back up the legislative bodies <,> which have been <?> convened </?> so lacking
in high-tech expertise and comprehension <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#51:1:A>
Much of what I have said is reflected in <,> Bill Gates ' book <,> The Road
Ahead <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#52:1:A>
I recommend it to anyone who seeks access to enthusiastic high-tech
vision

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#53:1:A>
After all <,> he didn't get to the Chairman and Chief Executive of
Microsoft and the richest man in the world at the age of forty-one by getting
it wrong

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#54:1:A>
Furthermore he  ' s clearly backed by the hundred
million subscribers to the network of information and thought <,> that is the
greatest single influence in our society today

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#55:1:A>
Let not Hong Kong with its tremendous reputation for being in the
forefront of new ideas <,> lose that place in the world and fall behind </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-021#56:2:A>
Last Tuesday <,> the Secretary for Recreation and Culture <,> Brian
Chau announced the shelving of an <?> onerous </?> broadcasting bill that
his branch has been drafting since nineteen ninety-two

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#57:2:A>
The media were quick to interpret this year's <unc> 1-word
</unc> to the so-called China Factor <,> though this was vigorously denied by
Mr Chau the governor and China <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#58:2:A>
Ching So the outgoing secretary had pledged in September nineteen
ninety-five that the bill would be ready by early nineteen ninety-six <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#59:2:A>
In October the Government published a policy commitment to produce
this comprehensive legislation and I quote <,> <quote> to make the regulatory framework
more user-friendly and adaptable to rapid changes in technology </quote> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#60:2:A>
Previously Michael Leung acting as Chief Secretary in May nineteen
ninety-five <,> had said categorically that the Government had not shelved this
piece of legislation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#61:2:A>
He said this two days after a reported statement by acting
Recreation and Culture Secretary Fred Ting saying it had been shelved because
it was a half-baked chestnut cake which was likely to be delayed by China <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#62:2:A>
As I remember it <,> what Fred Ting actually said was that the bill
drafter had been unable to keep up with technology <,> which was so fast-moving
and so complex <,> the bill has become a half-baked chestnut cake <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#63:2:A>
He thought the transfer of sovereignty <,> would be upon us before
it could be enacted <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#64:2:A>
The politicians however in their haste to latch onto the China
Factor <,> neglected the real reason <,> which does have very little publicity <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#65:2:A>
Brian Chau has now confirmed that it is being shelved because <,> he
said there are higher-priority matters such as video on demand <,> pay TV <,>
and the three-day-old Consumer Council report <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#66:2:A>
Reading between the lines Government had set themselves a hopeless
task of producing highly complex legislation within a disorganized
administrative system when profound understanding and clear leadership of a
dynamic technology was absolutely essential for progress <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#67:2:A>
For the past year <,> they have been trying to climb out of this
embarrassment and Brian Chau has finally found a way <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#68:2:A>
How did Government get into this mess <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#69:2:A>
By drifting into a regulatory framework <,> wrapped around a technology
they did not understand <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#70:2:A>
This resulted in a catastrophic split of earthquake proportions in
the government policy structure <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#71:2:A>
Telecommunications was handled by one secretary <,> and broadcasting
technology by another <,,> both subordinate to different seniors the only formal
link between them being through the Governor himself

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#72:2:A>
Inevitably <,> the structure failed with every advance in the
technology <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#73:2:A>
It failed when <,> Star TV could not be licensed under the TV Ordinance
<,> and had to be <?> lobbed </?> over to the other secretary under the
Telecommunications Ordinance <,,> completely inappropriately <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#74:2:A>
The result is a wide divergence between licensing condition for
satellite and cable TV <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#75:2:A>
It failed from the moment video on demand was revealed to the
public in February nineteen ninety-four <,> giving Government over two years <,> to
establish the policy and regulations <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#76:2:A>
So completely have they failed <,> they are now having to drop
everything <,> to get their affairs into some sort of shape <,> before the technology
becomes available to the public in July <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#77:2:A>
It has resulted in inequitable <,> royalties between Cable and
traditional TV operators <,> in inequitable consumer pricing structure
between telephones and cable TV outlet <,> inconsistencies in media ownership
rules <,> anti-competitive practices and unnecessary costs to subscribers <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#78:2:A>
All the time <,> the technology has spread faster than administration-led 
law drafters can draft laws <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#79:2:A>
Brian Chau had said that <,> there will be no great harm in leaving the
bill till after the Handover <,> when the SAR government can pick it up where the
Hong Kong Government has left off <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#80:2:A>
Absolutely <,> categorically <,> and unconditionally wrong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#81:2:A>
By then the technology will have advanced so much further <,> that the
present draft won't be worth the disk it is written on <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#82:2:A>
The mess can be traced back <,> to a misunderstanding of the
broadcasting policy in the first place <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#83:2:A>
Various Secretaries of Recreation and Culture <,> wallowed in fine words
like <mention> educating </mention> <mention> informing </mention> <mention> entertaining </mention> <mention> providing a broad spectrum of views </mention> and
so on <,> without looking through the telescope in the direction <,> the technology
was pointing <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#84:2:A>
They had become immersed in regulating and supplementing the
programming of commercial broadcaster whose main short-term concern was to
find a success formula and stick to it

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#85:2:A>
Technology however <,> was telling us that <,> by the end of this century
<,> broadcasting as we know it <,> will not exist <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#86:2:A>
We will be in an era of multifarious and unscheduled choice <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#87:2:A>
The policy and a regulatory framework for that <,> would take internet
in <?> his </?> stride <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#88:2:A>
Much of this is contained <,> or touch on in the recent Consumer
Council report on broadcasting <,> an excellent document which benefitted from a
highly professional steering group <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#89:2:A>
Its principle recommendation is that <,> a new Policy Secretary should
be established responsible for <,> broadcasting telecommunication and
communication technologies <,> with a highly professional staff <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#90:2:A>
This would be a technological branch like the highly successful
works branch <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#91:2:A>
When this suggestion was put to a senior government official a week
ago <,> he said there was no need for such a branch <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#92:2:A>
The Secretary for Recreation and Culture could handle all the
relevant issues <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#93:2:A>
He instantly dismissed a highly professional report <,> with a casual
gesture <,> by indicating <?> that a </?> policy framework <,> which has failed miserably in the
past <,> and had now reached a point of public scandal should continue unchanged
in concept <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#94:2:A>
He implied an an administrator <,> with broad experience in say human
resources housing constitutional affairs and industry <,> can adapt to the
intricacy of cyberspace policy overnight <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#95:2:A>
Furthermore by putting Telecoms under the Secretary for Recreation
and Culture this particular senior government official would regard the
telephone on every senior executive's desk <,> including his own as either
recreation or culture <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#96:2:A>
When it comes to high technology I would like to see less snap 
ill-considered comments by administrator <,> and more well-considered decision by professional <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#97:2:A>
Four years ago <,> we set up a properly constituted office of the
Telecommunications Authority <,> headed by the professional <,<>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#98:2:A>
As a result <,> telecommunications in Hong Kong has made tremendous
progress <,,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#99:2:A>
In a same period <,> the whole issue of broadcasting has foundered <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#100:2:A>
The administrators have simply been unable <,> to pick it up <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#101:2:A>
It is now an enormous public scandal in which the traditional
nineteenth-century admin offices system has shown itself totally inadequate
to grasp today's technological and cultural revolution <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#102:2:A>
You simply can't jump from controlling hawkers one day to dealing
with high technology the next <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#103:2:A>
Brian Chau has said his branch will need six months to assess and
respond to the Consumer Council report <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#104:2:A>
They probably will need six months <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#105:2:A>
A team of expert <,> in broadcasting and related technology could
probably do it in two weeks <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#106:2:A>
I strongly recommend that he wastes no more precious time

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#107:2:A>
He should proceed tomorrow to establish and recruit the
professional staff <,> that the Consumer Council regards as absolutely essential
in which they have my full support <,> to get broadcasting in Hong Kong back on
the rails <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#108:2:A>
He should consider co-opting professionals immediately <,> to assist
in unravelling the tangle his branch must be in <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#109:2:A>
He has shown himself <,> to be different from the normal
I-am-always-right spokesman <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-021#110:2:A>
Perhaps <,> he is the one man who can create order out of the chaos
</I>
