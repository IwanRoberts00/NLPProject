<bold> Wonderland </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#2:1>
The shop was a labyrinth of high shelves stuffed with colorful
boxes of different sizes and shapes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#3:1>
Pretty blonde Barbies , lovely cloth puppets , finely detailed silver
cooking utensils , shiny golden heroic robots , the latest pocket-size TV
games , miniature grand pianos , exquisite model Benzes , Toyotas , Hondas ,
Mazdas , Fords ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#4:1>
Laughter from excited children filled the air , along with their
parents  '  caring gentle voices and Christmas carols &dash; how sweet !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#5:1>
The place was undoubtedly a paradise for children , except for me
perhaps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#6:1>
instead of hugging a newly bought toy out of the shop , what I brought
out was disappointment , jealousy and tears . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#7:1>
One cold Sunday noon before Christmas , I went shopping with my
family as usual .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#8:1>
To be more accurate , I should rather say &lsquo; hanging around
&rsquo; instead of &lsquo; shopping &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#9:1>
My dad didn't buy me anything &dash; no clothes , no toys , no sweets .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#10:1>
He said that since I was a primary three student I shouldn't make any
more silly requests for toys and I had to behave myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#11:1>
Was I too big to own toys really ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#12:1>
I wondered .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#13:1>
Every Monday , my classmates had the habit of comparing what their
parents bought them on Sunday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#14:1>
I kept silent whenever they discussed this topic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#15:1>
As we stepped into this wonderland , I lowered my head and stared
at the floor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#16:1>
&ldquo; Mom this way , see what a nice mini-supermarket !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#17:1>
With a cashier , notes and coins. , cans and corn ... I want this !
&rdquo; said my younger sister . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#18:1>
&ldquo; Oh child , this one is too expensive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#19:1>
Look at those doctor  ' s instruments , you can play with your little
brother ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#20:1>
&ldquo; No , I don't like doctors , they always give me bitter
medicine ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#21:1>
&ldquo; Who says you are going to be the patient this time , you
are the doctor my girl !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#22:1>
You can give medicine to you brother , sisters and father ... &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#23:1>
&ldquo; Yeah ! I want it , I could prescribe a dozen super bitter
pills to little brother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#24:1>
He hit me yesterday ! ... and I could give him a very painful big
needle as well ... ha ha &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#25:1>
&lsquo; My elder sister stole my sweets yesterday &semi; can I
have a toy gun or a bomb for revenge ? &rsquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#26:1>
I whispered to myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#27:1>
Surely , I never <-> wanedt </-> <+> wanted </+> a toy gun , but if
dad would have bought me one , I would have welcomed it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#28:1>
At least , it would have been a toy , a gift ... it would have been
something . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#29:1>
On my other side , little brother was grasping a corner of my
daddy  ' s shirt , trying to make him buy the latest TV game . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#30:1>
&ldquo; TV game , TV game , I  ' m bored with Brother Mario , and I
want Adventure Island ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#31:1>
&ldquo; See , you are addicted to TV games ! &rdquo; my father
complained . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#32:1>
&ldquo; I want it !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#33:1>
I want it ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#34:1>
This time my little brother used his &lsquo; always win strategy
&rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#35:1>
He blinked his eyes fast and sniffed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#36:1>
With a deep breath he opened his mouth wide and began his artificial
cry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#37:1>
My elder sister stood outside the toy shop alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#38:1>
She looked satisfied as she kept peering inside the paper bag that
contained her newly bought dress .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#39:1>
I didn't understand why she preferred a dress to a toy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#40:1>
But she did have her own Christmas present , and my younger sister
and brother were going to have theirs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#41:1>
Standing helplessly in the center of the shop , my mind was
struggling : &ldquo; Should I ask dad to buy me a toy ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#42:1>
My brother and sisters have theirs , why couldn't I get one ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#43:1>
Is this reasonable ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#44:1>
Fair enough ... Go , go ahead okay ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#45:1>
Okay , okay ... but dad always turned me down ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#46:1>
It  ' s Christmas time , right ? ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#47:1>
But ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#48:1>
My mind wasn't made up yet , but I saw my dad had already made
the purchase and was going to leave . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#49:1>
And at that time , I knew that I had no time to lose or else I
wouldn't have my gift .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#50:1>
I ran in front of my father .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#51:1>
With my head down and body tensed , my nervous voice asked &ldquo;
Dad , can I have my Christmas gift too ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#52:1>
Can I have a toy as my gift? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#53:1>
&ldquo; Why didn't you say it any earlier ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#54:1>
I  ' ve made the purchase already .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#55:1>
You are being troublesome !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#56:1>
Leave now , why do you like toys so much , you are such a big child ,
huh? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#57:1>
Definitely , I knew these were excuses .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#58:1>
And my dad continued his harsh murmuring while leaving .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#59:1>
Unintentionally , I took a look at my dad  ' s face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#60:1>
It was strict , angry , cold and harsh .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#61:1>
Why did he face me with such an expression ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#62:1>
What was wrong with asking for a Christmas gift ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#63:1>
My siblings had got for theirs already .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#64:1>
His serious look and frightening eyes were blaming me as if I had
cheated on an exam , stolen in shop , been caught by police or even murdered
somebody .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#65:1>
&ldquo; Why is that ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#66:1>
Why is he so strict to me only ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#67:1>
Why? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#68:1>
I shouted inside my heart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#69:1>
My eyes became watery , obscuring my sight , and tears rolled down
drop by drop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#70:1>
I tried to keep my lips closed tight to avoid an outburst of crying ,
and I tried to stop shaking . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#71:1>
&ldquo; What a barbarian you are , you know ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#72:1>
Cry for toys , how shameful !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#73:1>
I  ' ve never seen such a bad child ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#74:1>
I couldn't suppress my feelings any longer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#75:1>
I cried . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#76:1>
Though , I covered with my hands , from the gaps between my
fingers , I noticed some attention from the passers-by . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#77:1>
&ldquo; What happened to that girl ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#78:1>
Crying so hard , so poor ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#79:1>
&ldquo; Why does she cry in the street , she looks like a good
girl , doesn't seem naughty ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#80:1>
See , strangers took pity on me too , why didn't my dad ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#81:1>
Didn't he realise that he was too harsh on me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#82:1>
I couldn't stop my tears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#83:1>
Mixed with spots of sweat , little droplets of liquid kept dripping
down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#84:1>
I wished I had never raised my silly request .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#85:1>
Most probably , anger had conquered my mind and I wished illogically
that I could have the courage to run away from my family , or to fight with
my father , or to pick up a stone and break the glass of a shop-window , in
order to vent my anger .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#86:1>
I hated myself , I hated the fact that I was not brave enough !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#87:1>
Why was I always weak and useless ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#88:1>
Why didn't I dare to say and do what I desired ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#89:1>
Exhausted by minutes of crying , my mind was blank .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#90:1>
I felt dizzy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#91:1>
With my sensation , I heard my mom whisper to my dad , &ldquo; Tell
her you will buy her a toy , tell her ... tell her now ... &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#92:1>
Eventually , my father spoke again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#93:1>
&ldquo; Go and choose one, &rdquo; he said with his softer tone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#94:1>
My mom pushed me into the shop again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#95:1>
Actually , I didn't want to &lsquo; receive &rsquo; a toy in such a
way .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#96:1>
If I had my own choice , I would have refused the offer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#97:1>
But I knew that I shouldn't act against my father  ' s command . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#98:1>
I glanced at the paradise again , but this time with blurred
vision .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#99:1>
My mom asked me &ldquo; Do you like that mermaid puppet ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#100:1>
She  ' s lovely ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#101:1>
My elder sister advised me : &ldquo; How about that funny looking
puppy ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#102:1>
You like dogs , let  ' s get it ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#103:1>
If my mom had known what I was thinking at that time , she would
surely have been angry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#104:1>
In fact , none of the toys in the shop attracted me !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#105:1>
I didn't even understand myself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#106:1>
Perhaps I wanted a gift because my siblings all had theirs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#107:1>
Perhaps , I wanted to try the taste of being proud and showing off
in front of my classmates what my parents bought me for Christmas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#108:1>
At last , I randomly picked a silly looking Miss Rainbow fairy
as my gift for Christmas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#109:1>
When the shopkeeper gave Miss Rainbow to me , she knelt down and
said to me with her sincere smile &ldquo; No more tears girl !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#110:1>
See , your father is buying you a toy now , he wouldn't reject you ,
right ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#111:1>
Smile again , don't be silly ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#112:1>
Though , I disagreed strongly with her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#113:1>
Still , I returned a tiny smile to her , and then left the shop with
my &lsquo; miss Silly &rsquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#114:1>
The following week , my family went out shopping again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#115:1>
When we arrived at the toys department , I turned away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#116:1>
I went and examined the cookery utensils at the next counter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#117:1>
Then my mom came to me , &ldquo; Choose a toy , girl , I  ' ll buy you
one this time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#118:1>
Wanna take this lovely pink rabbit puppet home? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#119:1>
I nodded my head thankfully with mixed feelings , Secretly and
soundlessly , I said &ldquo; Thanks mom !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#120:1>
Is this compensation for my experience last time? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#121:1>
With a little smile and a tiny tear in my eyes , I watched as
she bought the toy for me . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#122:2>
<bold> Mama ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#123:2>
What does the word &lsquo; mama &rsquo; mean ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#124:2>
A lady who gives birth to babies ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#125:2>
The one who nurtures little children into great men ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#126:2>
A person who owns your flesh and blood ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#127:2>
A soft voice , sincere face , caring eyes , gentle hands ,
concerned personality , someone who take cares of our meals and our clothes ,
who helps us with our homework , guides us through our love affairs and to
our marriage ... is this the description of every mom ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#128:2>
My mom seemed to be an exception . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#129:2>
My mom always scolded me &semi; even the slightest mistake would
be viewed as seriously as an unforgivable crime .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#130:2>
My mom never helped me study for any dictations , quizzes , tests or
exams , and she sent me away whenever I asked a single question .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#131:2>
My mom never showed appreciation for any of my achievements , from a
mark of 100 in a dictation to winning a prize in an art competition .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#132:2>
To her , nothing I did seemed to be worth praise .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#133:2>
My mom always kept me at home , didn't let me go to my classmates  ' 
birthday parties , join school camps or picnics , participate in extra
curricular activities ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#134:2>
I felt like a wild-bird confined in a cage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#135:2>
My mom never waited for me outside school , comforted me when I
was sad or brought me to the doctor when I was sick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#136:2>
Once when I asked her to accompany me to the doctor  ' s , she just
replied : &ldquo; Kid , how old are you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#137:2>
Primary three already !

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#138:2>
Just tell the doctor how you feel and that  ' s it ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#139:2>
Once , I did wish I could have another mom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#140:2>
I wished for a mom who could support me in every way , give me the
courage to fight my fears and provide me with faith .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#141:2>
I wished for a mom who could share my joy whenever I had tiny
achievements &semi; share my sorrow whenever failures came to me &dash; to
smile with me as well as cry with me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#142:2>
I wished for a mom who I could depend on for my whole life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#143:2>
No matter how bad the world treated me , she would the one willing
to comfort me and say : &ldquo; My child , have no fear , I  ' m always here
and I  ' ll be with you forever . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#144:2>
I wished for a mom who would think of me , remember me and even let
me live in her mind in case I passed away before her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#145:2>
Only when my mom told me her story did I realise that I hadn't
understood her totally . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#146:2>
Her own father had been a nasty guy who flirted with countless
women .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#147:2>
Her own mother had been a young innocent gal who couldn't even
manage to take care of herself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#148:2>
Her parents did not offer a blessing nor give her a glance before
giving her up , their child .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#149:2>
When she was born , she was loved by nobody &semi; she was a burden
for the people who were responsible for her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#150:2>
Her foster family made her work all day long , beat her whenever
they were angry and treated her as a maid to the family while calling her
daughter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#151:2>
When she was three , she met her real mother and was told to call
her  ' aunt  '  . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#152:2>
As she grew , she was had no chances to attend school , hang
around with friends , go to parties , enjoy childhood or see the wonders of
life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#153:2>
When she was eighteen , her younger sister found her and met her ,
but they were never to meet again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#154:2>
All she ever heard from her father was the message that her sister
passed on : &ldquo; never approach us again . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#155:2>
Without knowing the idea of a loving family , she married a poor
guy and gave birth to four innocent lives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#156:2>
Can you blame a lady who had never been loved by her family for
not knowing how to express her love and affection to her children ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#157:2>
Then suddenly , I remembered ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#158:2>
The box of dolls my mom bought for me when I had high fever when I
was three .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#159:2>
Her mutterings of &ldquo; put more clothes on &rdquo; whenever the
weather turned cold .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#160:2>
The favourite dishes she cooked for me every birthday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#161:2>
The cakes she always used to bring to me whenever I was burning the
midnight oil .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#162:2>
Her visit to the boutique that I worked in last summer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#163:2>
The lovely shirt that I longed for and that she bought me when she
went to Japan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#164:2>
How did she know I loved it ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#165:2>
Sorry , Mom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#166:2>
Your daughter didn't know you before .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#167:2>
Mama , I wish I had always known your story .

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#168:2>
And here I would like give you this poem : </p>

<p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X169:2>
The feeling of being loved I always dreamt about it Where was it ?
How could I seize it ? Someone told me it was just around the corner </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X170:2>
A voice told me : You can never lose it Nor never pay for it It
dies as you die It smiles as you smile It suffers as you suffer ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X171:2>
I closed my eyes Calmed my mind Felt with my heart And prayed
to god , &ldquo; My Father , please guide me towards it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X172:2>
Slowly , from the total silence A voice emerged Far but near
Unclear but sincere I wondered </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X173:2>
Again , I opened my eyes A glimpse of light shone into my eye I
found that I had come to another day </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-002#X174:2>
But wait , the voice sounded again Yes , it  ' s here &dash; it  ' s
your voice , Mama </p> </X> </I>
