<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X1:1:Z>
Welcome back

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X2:1:Z>
Our subject is importing foreign labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X3:1:Z>
Lee Cheuk Yan importers argue that importing foreign labour will
restore the economy which right now is suffering from mass emigration high
wage demand and uh a high staff turnover rate

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X4:1:Z>
They argue that without <,> the imported labour the whole economy
obviously including the workers are were suffer in a long run </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#5:1:A>
But I think basically we have to look at some of the real facts
when when employer say that you know Hong Kong <,> uh is suffering from high
wages

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#6:1:A>
Look at the wages of the workers you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#7:1:A>
And and when we look at the statistic the real wage index of workers
in the garment trade say

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#8:1:A>
Uh when compare to six years ago it had dropped by twelve percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#9:1:A>
In the shoe manufacturing sector it had dropped by uh thirty percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#10:1:A>
And overall the or in whole manufacturing sector it had only
increased by four percent of real wage

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#11:1:A>
So actually it reflect that uh the the the wages of workers are not
really that high and not really <,> pushing <,> the the wage to a limit where
the <,> the the investor will leave

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#12:1:B>
Well that may well be true

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#13:1:B>
But uhm <,> you must be aware of the counter argument to that which
is <,> if uhm the worker are going to demand more and more wages in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#14:1:B>
Then manufacturers are going to set up <,> their manufacturing
facilities across the broader in Guangdong provinces in the Shenzhen economic
zone

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#15:1:B>
Now uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#16:1:A>
Yeah this is in <{> <[> <?> addictable </?> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#17:1:B>
<[> This </[> </{> <,> this is something you have to you know

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#18:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#19:1:A>
Even if we uh <,> say freeze the wage for three years or five years
the employers will still go

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#20:1:A>
Because the the manufacturing sector wages and every thing in China
is very is comparatively very low

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#21:1:A>
And so you can't help it

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#22:1:A>
<{> <[> But I think </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#23:1:B>
<[> Except that the </[> </{> infrastructure in China if I may
say so is not quite as good as Hong Kong <{> <[> <,> uh and would not be </[>
for a long long time

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#24:1:A>
<[> Yeah that  ' s exactly the point </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#25:1:A>
And so we are Hong Kong has its own attraction for manufacturer

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#26:1:A>
And it  ' s not <,> the problem with manufacturer in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#27:1:A>
It  ' s not wages <,> and they <?> good </?> uhm they  ' re going to
China

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#28:1:A>
It  ' s because they want to have low wages

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#29:1:A>
And that so they tolerate the the bad infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#30:1:A>
But because of good infrastructure we can keep the employers in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#31:1:A>
So the problem with the Hong Kong manufacturer now is other problem
you <{> <[> know </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#32:1:B>
<[> So </[> </{> you are saying wages is not an issue with the
manufacturers

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#33:1:B>
But it  ' s wages an issue with the workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#34:1:B>
I mean would they go away if they are not going to get a ten
fifteen percent increase every year

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#35:1:A>
They cannot go

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#36:1:A>
So would that  ' s what happen in <{> <[> the </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#37:1:B>
<[> They </[> </{> they can certainly join the uhm <,> the the
hawkers in the street

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#38:1:B>
Or they can set up their own businesses and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#39:1:B>
Leave the manufacturing to somebody else

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#40:1:B>
They can change profession is what I  ' m <{> <[> saying </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#41:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> it  ' s <?> net </?> not that easy

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#42:1:A>
I think the basic problem now is <,> in the service industry

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#43:1:A>
Uh the the workers in the manufactory cannot move to the service
industry where there are more work available

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#44:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#45:1:A>
Because there are no training for them

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#46:1:A>
So what we are saying in uh in the labour movement is that

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#47:1:A>
How to solve the <?> pay </?> problem of labour shortage in the
service industry is by training workers in the manufacturing to move forward
to the service industry

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#48:1:A>
And you don't have to import labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#49:1:A>
Because in the manufacturing there are surplus labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#50:1:A>
And in the service industry there are <{> <[> shortage labour </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#51:1:B>
<[> And you put </[> </{> that point to the Hong Kong
government and what has the Hong Kong government said <,> in in answer to
that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#52:1:A>
I think uh the Hong Kong government had always has a policy of
uh <,> non intervention

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#53:1:A>
And they don't <,> don't want to go into training

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#54:1:A>
I think that  ' s the basic problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#55:1:A>
That the way to solve the problem is uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#56:1:A>
For us is to retraining but for the Hong Kong government is to
import of labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#57:1:A>
And this actually in in contradiction to what the Hong Kong
Governor say in in two years ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#58:1:A>
I remember two years ago they he said <,> very clearly that any
import labour would not be <,> uh consider

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#59:1:A>
Because <,> it would <,> uh affected the workers for uh share of
the prosperity of Hong Kong

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#60:1:B>
Well but can <{> <[> you </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#61:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> nowadays it  ' s very inconsistent

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#62:1:B>
Can you seriously argue that the import of <,> say fifteen
thousand workers <,> uh into a city which has got close to one million <,>
people working in industries

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#63:1:B>
Can you seriously say that that would have immaterial effect on on
the wages levels

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#64:1:A>
Yes of

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#65:1:A>
Because in Hong Kong the basic uh difference of Hong Kong and other
societies is that

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#66:1:A>
Here in Hong Kong every thing is supply and demand <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#67:1:A>
You we don't have collective bargaining

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#68:1:A>
We don't have any wage broad to set the wage of the workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#69:1:A>
Every thing is according to the rule of supply and demand

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#70:1:A>
So imagine supplying more workers into a <.> se </.> sector

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#71:1:A>
It for sure would affect <,> the <,> the whole uh wage uh setting
<.> si </.>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#72:1:A>
And for and uh it also it affect also the workers  '  demand for
better wages or at least wages to cover the inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#73:1:A>
Because uh when when you ask for more wages the employers will say
okay we will import more labour next year

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#74:1:A>
Then that would be always a problem for workers to have <.> im </.>
have an improvement in their wage level

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X75:1:Z>
As uh more people now effected have been the democracy movement
and and the new China news agency had become <,> an <?> airline </?> have
sort uh by suggesting what telling the government to

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X76:1:Z>
They took a stand and came up advise the government what they
should

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X77:1:Z>
The government should be negotiating with uh a union movement to
uh settle this dispute

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X78:1:Z>
Just a case of politics uh making straight bad fellows </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#79:1:A>
Yeah of course we are

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#80:1:A>
In this issue we are glad that the new China news agency make a
statement

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#81:1:A>
But of course it  ' s very obvious it  ' s political motivated

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#82:1:A>
Because if they had supplemented by saying because they don't want
the liberal so called liberal to manipulate this issue into election <,>
issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#83:1:A>
So they do the right thing but with the wrong motive you can say

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#84:1:A>
But uh but I think if they are really serious about you know <,> uh
keeping uh the workforce in Hong Kong happy

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#85:1:A>
They should <,> know have a policy that China will not export
labour

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#86:1:A>
Then for sure <,> this will have a a very good in influence on the
Hong Kong workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#87:1:A>
Because uh the fifteen uh thousand quota

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#88:1:A>
Many of them will be from China

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#89:1:B>
<{> <[> And perhaps </[> promote somebody internally in NCNA
for a change <&>

<$A> laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X90:1:Z>
<[> And <.> pe </.> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X91:1:Z>
Okay thank you very much for coming in

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X92:1:Z>
We  ' ll be back with uh Martin Barrow chairman of the Hong Kong
Tourist Association </X> </I>


<I>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X93:2:Z>
Hello Jonathan Fenby is uh still on holiday at the moment or that
just about to come to an end

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X94:2:Z>
So this is Keith Kay with our weekly chat programme where we talk
to prominent and interesting people about issue facing Hong Kong today <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X95:2:Z>
That  ' s my pleasure to welcome Audrey Eu who  ' s Chairman of the
<?> Bar </?> Association and uh <,> perhaps therefore a frontline and the
battle to preserve the rule of law in Hong Kong and ensure that we do retain
the present legal system here for at least <,> uh the next fifty years
welcome to the programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X96:2:Z>
<?> Press read this </?> first of all talk about some of the
issues that uhm the <?> Bar </?> Association is facing

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X97:2:Z>
What would you say is your prime concern at the moment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#98:2:A>
Well I have a number of prime concern <&> All speakers laugh
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#99:2:A>
It  ' s not particularly good year I think good fortune

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#100:2:A>
Well uhm I think <,> first of all we of course have the
provisional legislature which has been concern for the <?> Bar </?> for quite
some time

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#101:2:A>
Uh we recently had the consultation paper on uh social uh the
society ordinance and public <unc> one-word </unc> ordiance

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#102:2:A>
We recently have in in news read about the proposal uh that will
be made uh for the <,> children in the PRC who would after first of July have
the right to abode uh in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#103:2:A>
And then I think on a sort of internal aspect as far profession
concern we also <,> face with problem such as uh the uh use of Chinese in a
sense of development of bilingualism

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#104:2:A>
Uh we have <?> alls </?> always have problems about uh number of
people joining the profession and question of standard in <,> in the
profession and so on

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X105:2:Z>
So you  ' ve got a busy year haven't you <{> <[> <unc> one-word
</unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#106:2:A>
<[> Busy year </[> </{> yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X107:2:Z>
Let  ' s pick up on the the the the recent proposal of the changes
to the uhm society ordinance and so on that  ' s consultation exercise

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X108:2:Z>
Do you think that was a successful consultation exercise </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#109:2:A>
Well we don't know the result of the uh <,> of a consultation
exercise

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#110:2:A>
We know the views had been <?> sending </?> and of course I think
uh uh a quite uh <,> a good uh number of uh uh submission four thousand <?>
right </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#111:2:A>
I get that from the papers and and it I mean in that sense of
course it  ' s successful

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X112:2:Z>
You may representation yourself I think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#113:2:A>
Uhm the <?> Bar </?> may uh uh uh representation the form of
position paper

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#114:2:A>
I <,> <?> wrote </?> not call which was published in uh English
newspaper

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X115:2:Z>
And it seem to be sign of this week that in fact some of the
points we  ' re getting through that was interview are softening uh <,> uh all
all attitude towards those changes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#116:2:A>
Well I think it it is a good sign that uh uh a responsible
government having consulted uh and having receiving the views uh would take
at least some of the views

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X117:2:Z>
Uhm <,> of the provisional legislature there is uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X118:2:Z>
Is that uh <,> an ongoing any consultation exercise on that do
you think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#119:2:A>
Uhm no it  ' s not the question of consultation exercise

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#120:2:A>
I mean at the moment we of course have the provisional legislature
which is proposing to pass uh laws or to take steps to pass laws which will
come into effect on first of July

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X121:2:Z>
Can <,> so what  ' s your main concern there <{> <[> <,> that </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#122:2:A>
<[> Well I </[> </{> think there  ' re really two aspects to

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#123:2:A>
One is the the status of the provisional legislature whether in
fact it is in <?> confidential </?> the Basic Law and in that sense but
therefore it has a a solid legal and constitutional bases

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#124:2:A>
The other <,> aspect is that it it is taking uh steps uh <,> uh uh
<,> which is part of the legal process in passing laws but whereas in fact
<,> even if they uh aware a a valid legislation the first place

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#125:2:A>
Uh it  ' s quite clear that their pass would only <,> uh be
effective from first of July <{> <[> onwards </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X126:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X127:2:Z>
Uh uh I I think I won't say <unc> two-words </unc> pass
any laws

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X128:2:Z>
Uhm but they are going through uhm stages I think they got
through uhm some early stages reading some <{> <[> bills </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#129:2:A>
<[> That  ' s </[> </{> right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X130:2:Z>
If they left and <?> actual </?> pass the bill so after the first
of July <,> would that satisfy concern </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#131:2:A>
Will uhm I think the the the question is is this

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#132:2:A>
Uh what what what is the <.> au </.> authority

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#133:2:A>
Where is the associated authority

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#134:2:A>
I mean if you say that you are the legislature from the first of
July then you command you legislative process from the first of July

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#135:2:A>
I mean you you of course can take preparatory steps

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#136:2:A>
I mean uh our Chief Executive doesn't he take a lot of <?> about
</?> preparatory steps the

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#137:2:A>
But the the <,> in in the difference between passing laws and and
having in uh implementing legal process is that <,> uh what you do <unc>
one-word </unc> to you having the authority is is not <.> le </.> <.> le
</.> effective

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X138:2:Z>
But it  ' s not actually what they  ' re doing really

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X139:2:Z>
Does he taking preparatory steps now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#140:2:A>
Well there is difference because if you if you take
preparatory steps such as uh consulting such as deliberating discussing and
and debating

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#141:2:A>
I mean this can all be <.> delib </.> uh <.> pre </.> preparatory
steps but if you say would part of these steps or these steps in fact are
part of the legal process for the passing of laws then the question is will
where where is the source of the authority for the passing of these laws

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X142:2:Z>
So what would you like to see happen </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#143:2:A>
Well we we have actually uh on the problem of the provisional
legislature be be <,> be making <,> a number of representation

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#144:2:A>
And we  ' ve always been saying what we wanted to happen

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#145:2:A>
The primary thing of course <,> what we wanted to happen is that
<,> we have a legislature which is constituted in accordance with the Basic
Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#146:2:A>
And the Basic Law is very very clear on the <,> on the
establishment of our first legislature and first must mean the first one to
come into <?> effect </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#147:2:A>
It doesn't <,> depend on what label you attach to

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#148:2:A>
You can't say <?> uh </?> because we don't call it the first
legislature we call it the provisional legislature

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#149:2:A>
And will then it does not have to comply with the provisions and
the Basic Law uh for the first legislature

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X150:2:Z>
So should the provisional legislature stop having their meeting
in in in Shenzhen or they having now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#151:2:A>
Well it it is said there there are really two aspects to it

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#152:2:A>
And <,> the the first aspect is something that <,> at the moment
are <unc> one-word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X153:2:Z>
So it  ' s something is not going to become apparent to after the
first of July or the problem that it creates </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#154:2:A>
Well uhm <,> we we we can see the problems already

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#155:2:A>
I mean we we we we have pointed it our that <,> uh the the
constitution the establishment of provisional legislature is not in
accordance to the Basic Law

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X156:2:Z>
Uhm <,> once the <,> once the first won the <unc> two-words
</unc> all the primes concern then in simply that any law anything that
they discuss now any law that they certainly pass now

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X157:2:Z>
Once you once uh anybody uhm is a charge under those laws or they
go through the course progress

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X158:2:Z>
The the challenge was simply be that was unconstitutional </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#159:2:A>
Yeah that that is the first problem that that really the the
the constitutionality of the body itself

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X160:2:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X161:2:Z>
So how your voice that vacuum in the sort of transition uh uh uh
if they can't do all that preparatory work after the first of July <{> <[> uh
</[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#162:2:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> you you moving on to the second <{> <[>
question </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X163:2:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X164:2:Z>
So how do you cure that problem </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#165:2:A>
Well in in fact this is <?> sit </?> a problem the the the
the <?> Bar </?> has been making submission some for quite some time

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#166:2:A>
I mean we we say that provisional that you know the the the
legislature has to comply with the provision of the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#167:2:A>
A has to be elected

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#168:2:A>
B uh the the way the the sixteen members have to be constituted
should be in accordance with the method of the formation which is uh you have
to have <,> uh thirty people from the functional constituencies

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#169:2:A>
Ten from the from the indirect elections from election committees
and twenty from the geographical constituencies

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#170:2:A>
I mean the the provisional legislature simply is not constituted
in accordance with that composition

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X171:2:Z>
The argument being now the the but this is necessary now the
provisional legislature but the other then move into being able to establish
<,> uh the the full proper legislature as under the Basic Law which they  ' re
saying what happening year later </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#172:2:A>
Well the the the the uh uh decision of the MPC gives the
power to the preparatory committee <,> to establish the first legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#173:2:A>
And <,,> uh uh uh what what the preparatory committee was doing
was not to establish the first legislature but to establish the provisional
legislature in in in a way which is not as prescribe in the decision

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X174:2:Z>
This is Keith Kay sitting in for Jonathan Fenby and our guest
this week Audrey Eu Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X175:2:Z>
Does the <,> lack of the court of final appeal at the moment
cause concern as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-050#176:2:A>
Uhm <,> it it it won't mean that we properly would have
period of time when we don't have a functioning uh a court of final appeal
although in name we  ' ll have a a court of final appeal

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#177:2:A>
Because I think the building is there I mean you can see the words
which are being carried on

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#178:2:A>
And I understand the the hardware will be there but uh it  ' s
really filling it up with the judges because we are running really really
very short of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#179:2:A>
And we now in May uhm I I get it from the papers

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#180:2:A>
I have no inside information but I get it from a paper that we
will have the new CJ announced some time this month

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#181:2:A>
And then you were talking uh about June already and <,> uh whoever
the new CJ is going to be he would have a lot of work to do <,> to really uhm
fill up the judges of the court of final appeal

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#182:2:A>
Fill up the judges of the court of appeal if they they are
promoted then to the court of final appeal

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#183:2:A>
And fill up those judges in a high court if they are promoted to
the uh court of appeal

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#184:2:A>
So uhm it there  ' re also the question of uhm inviting foreign
judges uh from aboard to come and and sit on a non- permanent bases

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#185:2:A>
And and then of course uh you  ' ll have to have very clear rules
for the profession and for the public uh for <?> faring </?> forms to <{> <[>
timetable </[> and things that sort

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X186:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-050#X187:2:Z>
Is that essential that the court of final appeal is there on the
first of July was there some <?> lead </?> way </X> </I>
