<h> <bold> A lamentable move </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#2:1>
American unilateralism has again won through , to the detriment of
the world community .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#3:1>
This time , the casualty is Jose Bustani , the director-general of the
145-nation Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#4:1>
Although Mr Bustani was unanimously re-elected last year to head
the agency charged with eliminating chemical weapons , his views towards Iraq
were apparently not shared by the United States .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#5:1>
With Washington providing 22 per cent of the agency  ' s funding , it
was a simple matter of threatening to pull its financial support to have the
Brazilian diplomat removed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#6:1>
US President George W. Bush is intent - world opinion with him or
not - on taking up his father  ' s failed bid to topple Iraq  ' s Saddam Hussein .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#7:1>
The Gulf War failure weighs heavily on the Bush family reputation , it
seems , and the US is desperately trying to get international support for its
efforts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#8:1>
So far , there has been little enthusiasm for the war against
terrorism to be extended to a country which has no proven links to Osama bin
Laden or his al-Qaeda network .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#9:1>
International chemical weapons inspection teams have been variously
blocked and then allowed to carry out their duties by Saddam , but they have
not turned up any threats from his regime . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#10:1>
Mr Bustani  ' s ousting was therefore shameful , but hardly
surprising .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#11:1>
Since Mr Bush took office 15 months ago , his government has
systematically pushed its own course on issues ranging from human rights to
the environment .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#12:1>
It is clear that it intends to push its own agenda for the sake of
its own needs and desires . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#13:1>
The pity is that the rest of the world is the loser .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#14:1>
The US , by far the world  ' s biggest polluter , went its own way on
the Kyoto Protocol on climate control , letting its factories set their own
targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#15:1>
Last week , it removed Robert Watson , the outspoken climatologist
who chaired the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#16:1>
The US also walked out of a race conference in South Africa last
year because it did not like criticism of its ally , Israel , over the
conflict with the Palestinians .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#17:1>
In recent days , it has again sided with Israel over incursions of
the West Bank . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#18:1>
It is lamentable that the US uses its economic advantage so
freely .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#19:1>
Perhaps it is time other nations became more vocal and use diplomatic
means to counter such practices . </p>

<h> <bold> SAR still leads way </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#21:2>
The Economist Intelligence Unit made some worthwhile observations
in its latest ranking table of the world  ' s best business locations .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#22:2>
In downgrading Hong Kong it argues the lack of decisive government ,
refusal to adopt a competition law and skills shortages are retarding the
territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#23:2>
It also rehashes a traditional lament of falling English
standards and lost purpose in light of China  ' s full economic opening with
scant analytical backing .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#24:2>
As a commentary the report ranks as an interesting opinion .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#25:2>
Judged as a rigorous comparative analysis it predictably lacks
substance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#26:2>
The EIU argues that Singapore has outdone Hong Kong in forming
policy towards private enterprise and competition .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#27:2>
It also cites Singapore  ' s stronger fiscal position .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#28:2>
While the city state has moved ahead of Hong Kong in a number of nuts
and bolts policy areas , we would contend its findings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#29:2>
Singapore  ' s typically low-value-added manufacturing industries
face accelerating hollowing-out pressures .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#30:2>
Despite a dramatic depreciation of its currency , deflation remains
embedded .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#31:2>
Low economy-wide returns on capital suggest a future funding crisis
of pensions and welfare payments while opaque government accounts means its
true fiscal position is difficult to gauge .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#32:2>
Development of service industries lags Hong Kong by a mile and
entrepreneurship remains weak . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#33:2>
The point is not to disparage Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#34:2>
However the EIU comparison takes on more than point-scoring
significance because many in the SAR want Hong Kong to embrace similar
policies .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#35:2>
As a result , understanding what makes this economy fundamentally
strong , and why the Singapore model is past its sell-by-date , is important .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#36:2>
Hong Kong and Singapore share common problems of a painful
unwinding from a government-sponsored property bubble .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#37:2>
They differ in the way they allocate capital across the rest of their
economies .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#38:2>
Hong Kong is far down the road to restructuring from a manufacturing
to services based economy .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#39:2>
While less physical goods will inevitably flow through the SAR , that
does not mean the value-creating activity backing such trade is lost . London
and New York are good examples . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#40:2>
Hong Kong firms are China  ' s best firms .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#41:2>
Many remain low key but are quietly building efficient operations
across the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#42:2>
The SAR faces many socio-political challenges , but fretting over
lost competitiveness is an unjustified distraction . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#43:3>
<h> <bold> Explicit message </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#44:3>
The symbolic message could not have been clearer .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#45:3>
Instead of heading straight to the United States , Vice-President Hu
Jintao has chosen to make a long detour to Malaysia and Singapore before
visiting the world  ' s most powerful nation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#46:3>
In Kuala Lumpur yesterday , the message was explicit .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#47:3>
In a keynote address , Mr Hu , who is widely believed to be in line
to succeed Jiang Zemin as President , said &ldquo; &obrack;  China &cbrack; opposes the
strong lording it over the weak and the big bullying the small . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#48:3>
While this has been the consistent line of China and , Mr Hu
named no country , there can be no doubt about the identity of the &ldquo;
strong &rdquo; country being the United States .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#49:3>
That Mr Hu has reiterated this line was a calculated attempt to set
the stage for his impending tour of America . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#50:3>
As the world  ' s largest developing nation , China wants to be
identified with other countries whose primary goal is to improve the
livelihood of their people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#51:3>
But while its rapid economic growth has inspired admiration ,
countries in the region are also increasingly concerned that China is sucking
in more and more foreign investment that could have gone to them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#52:3>
To address these concerns , Mr Hu yesterday thanked Asian
countries for their support of China  ' s accession to the World Trade
Organisation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#53:3>
But he also noted that China had helped the region by weathering the
Asian financial crisis without causing further instability by devaluating the
renminbi . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#54:3>
Militarily , the region  ' s leaders still harbour memories of
China  ' s support of communist insurgents from the 1950s to the 1970s .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#55:3>
Mr Hu  ' s reiteration of China  ' s pledge not to seek hegemony , not to
join any military bloc , and not to pursue its own spheres of influence was
therefore necessary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#56:3>
Already , some Asian countries have invited the United States to
maintain a presence in the region to counter the perceived threat of China .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#57:3>
The last thing that China wants is to be seen as a giant keen to flex
its muscle to meddle in other countries ' affairs . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#58:4>
<h> <bold> Confusion in the air </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#59:4>
Worries about the quality of the air we breathe in Hong Kong are
bad enough: surveys have repeatedly shown that air pollution is the number
one concern for an increasing portion of the population .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#60:4>
Now comes news that there is another measure of pollution - other
than the Air Pollution Index - which is measured by the Government but not
generally released to the public .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#61:4>
The concerned layman has every right to feel somewhat bemused . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#62:4>
To create further confusion , figures for fine pollution
particles , or PM2.5 , are also not generally released in many other parts of
the world; more importantly no legal limit is set on the amount of PM2.5
specifically to be present in the air . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#63:4>
The situation in the US is different.

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#64:4>
Following evidence that such pollutants were especially dangerous to
health it was decided to set limits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#65:4>
Whether PM10 - the combined measure of large and small particles
- is the index of importance or that which measures only small particles is
not yet , it seems , quite clear . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#66:4>
There is certainly no question of the Government hiding any data .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#67:4>
Nevertheless , when it is learned that levels of small particles ,
which are linked to lung disease and respiratory problems , are up to four
times the US legal limit , alarm bells must surely start to sound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#68:4>
Concern is exacerbated by research carried out by the University
of Hong Kong that found that 4,300 people a year are dying prematurely from
inhaling polluted air and 17,000 are admitted to hospital . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#69:4>
What is common sense is that more action needs to be taken
urgently to bring down all levels of pollution , because people are demanding
it and because it also makes economic sense .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#70:4>
Ultimately , reducing all harmful emissions is the priority , not
trying to differentiate different levels of toxicity . </p>

<h> <bold> Heeding the call </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#72:5>
Assassinated Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn represented the face of
a newly resurgent wave of right-wing politics in Europe .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#73:5>
Attracting loyalty and opposition in equal measure , Fortuyn built
his politics around populist themes such as stopping immigration and reducing
crime . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#74:5>
His assassination has shocked a nation that has long prided
itself on its traditions of tolerance and peaceful debate .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#75:5>
As tens of thousands of people paid their last respects at his
funeral in Rotterdam yesterday <it> fri </it> , pollsters predicted a
sympathy vote in coming elections that could catapult his party into helping
form a new government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#76:5>
Fortuyn was perhaps not as bigoted as France  ' s Jean-Marie Le Pen
, who caused a stir in France last month by winning the first round of the
presidential poll .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#77:5>
Neither were his views as extreme as Austria  ' s Joerg Haider . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#78:5>
But like the leaders of the French and Austrian right , Fortuyn
filled a niche in the right wing of the Dutch political spectrum , feeding on
voters ' disillusionment with the established political parties , playing on
feelings of nationalism and xenophobia . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#79:5>
Far-right and anti-immigrant candidates have in recent years
helped form coalition governments in Austria and Italy .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#80:5>
As in France , they have also made gains in Belgium , Denmark and the
Netherlands .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#81:5>
All these parties have benefited from the anxiety that many ordinary
people feel when faced with growing unemployment , slowing economic growth
and the growth of a new layer of government in the European Union . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#82:5>
While today  ' s European far-right parties do not espouse
dictatorship and violence , the rise in their support even in traditionally
liberal societies like the Netherlands and Scandinavia , marks a new mood in
the continent .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#83:5>
There is a danger that the more established political parties will
move rightwards as well , leading to a less tolerant Europe . </p>

<h> <bold> End of the line </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#85:6>
The decision by the KCRC chairman , Michael Tien Puk-sun to ask
members of the company  ' s board to take greater responsibility for monitoring
its operations is a welcome first step towards plugging some of the
management holes identified in the recent investigation by auditors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#86:6>
Mr Tien has said that he expects each board member to chair
committees within the board which would exercise greater oversight over the
way the KCRC functions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#87:6>
It is not clear whether Mr Tien is also considering other
suggestions made by the auditor , Ernest and Young , including the
appointment of new directors with experience of handling major projects .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#88:6>
It is important that new procedures are put in place speedily to
avoid the kind of problems that had emerged earlier . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#89:6>
The splitting of the roles of chairman of the board and chief
executive officer that has already happened has been a step towards creating
greater accountability .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#90:6>
Ideally , this opportunity should be used to create a new management
culture in public organisations like the KCRC .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#91:6>
For various historical reasons , government corporations like the
KCRC have been the preserve of former civil servants .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#92:6>
They have brought to these jobs considerable administrative and
practical experience , but not enough of the skills that are required to run
business corporations .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#93:6>
Procedures and methods of work that might have been acceptable in
the Government , appear to be poor management in the context of a corporation .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#94:6>
As new management systems are put in place , it is important
that the controversy raised by the extra payments to one of the contractors
be put aside .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#95:6>
An investigation by an external auditor has been completed , those
found wanting have apologised for their negligence , and the company  ' s
chairman has promised tighter controls .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#96:6>
There is little to be gained by endless debate on whether any of the
officials should step down , or whether a new probe is required . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#97:6>
It is important for Hong Kong that the West Rail project be
completed smoothly .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#98:6>
If the chief executive or any other senior staff were to step down ,
the project could be jeopardised . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#99:6>
In the long run , it is important to ensure sound corporate
governance in companies like the KCRC .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#100:6>
The obvious way to achieve this is to gradually privatise them ,
and allow the shareholders to appoint independent directors , and to submit
these corporations to the discipline of the market place .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#101:6>
Ultimately , this is the best way to ensure that they serve the
needs of the public . </p>

Southeast Asian countries are taking long-overdue steps towards
standardising laws against terrorism and cross-border crimes .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#104:7>
The measures will be difficult to put into place and enforce , but
all efforts must be made to make the region safer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#105:7>
Porous borders , especially between Indonesia , Malaysia and
the Philippines and Laos , Myanmar and Thailand , have fostered extensive
criminal activity .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#106:7>
Extremist groups and criminal networks have flourished and made
drug trafficking , money laundering , kidnapping and piracy widespread . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#107:7>
Since the terrorist attacks in the United States on September
11 , it has become clear that controls need to be implemented and
co-ordinated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#108:7>
Police and officials of the 10-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations decided at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur this week to make their
criminal codes more alike and to share information on crimes and criminal
activity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#109:7>
Efficiency and will are the catch-words but whether some Asean
countries have the resources and resolve is questionable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#110:7>
This is especially true in the &ldquo; Golden triangle &rdquo;
region of northern Thailand , Laos and Myanmar , where heroin and synthetic
drugs are flooding out at increasing rates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#111:7>
Improved co-operation between Indonesia , Malaysia and the
Philippines in tackling kidnapping gangs and Muslim extremists perhaps is the
example to follow . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#112:7>
The diverse economies and legal and political systems of Asean
countries make putting rules into place a daunting task .

<ICE-HK:W2E-005#113:7>
But with the threat of terrorism so great , the effort obviously
has to be made . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-005#114:7>
If we are to truly feel safe , nations in the region must
co-operate more and act swiftly to find common ground . </p>
