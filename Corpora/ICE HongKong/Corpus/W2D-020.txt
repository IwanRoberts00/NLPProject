<ICE-HK:W2D-020#6:1>
<bold> T </bold> here  ' s something about retro furniture that
captures the imaginations of its faithful followers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#7:1>
For people like Mike Chan , owner of SoHo  ' s largest retro furniture
stores , the fascination with furniture from the  '  20s to the  '  70s struck
while he was still in his early teens .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#8:1>
&ldquo; I  ' ve always had what my parents considered to be  ' strange
hobbies, ' so when I started collecting furniture from refuse centres and
flats that were about to be demolished , they didn't mind .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#9:1>
It  ' s a shame we don't have flea markets in Hong Kong ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#10:1>
Luckily , you don't have to get your hands dirty or risk being
caught by your friends in the compromising act of rummaging through a rubbish
dump to find something decent .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#11:1>
SoHo , which is known primarily as a thriving dining community , is
also a great place for fishing for one-off retro relics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#12:1>
Stepping into Chan  ' s Staunton Street shop Chen Mi Ji , for
example , is like stepping back into a time when plastic was actually classy
and one was never shy of pattern or color .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#13:1>
Expect to find all kinds of different treasures , including crockery
, old photos , chairs , clocks lamps and almost anything else for the home .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#14:1>
Chan stocks classic collector  ' s pieces , such as the quirky
white resin rocking chair by legendary  '  50s designer Charles Eames &obrack; 
&dollar;12,000); the classic &ldquo; Bird Chair &rdquo; buy fellow  '  50s
designer Harry Bertoia &obrack;  &dollar;12,000 &cbrack; , and the molded fibreglass chair by
George Nelson &obrack;  &dollar;12,800 &cbrack; - all worthy investments and purchases , even
if you  ' re not an aspiring or keen collector .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#15:1>
Other things to consider are Chan  ' s diverse range of clocks &obrack;  for
the wall and table , look to pay around &dollar;900 &cbrack; and other knickknacks
like wind-up toy chicks , Mickey Mouse figurines from the  '  60s &obrack;  prices
start from around &dollar;300 &cbrack; and record players by Philips &obrack;  &dollar;3,500 &cbrack; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#16:1>
Down the road is a smaller store packed with a combination of
retro and retro-inspired ornaments .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#17:1>
What makes MORN &obrack;  an acronym for &ldquo; Memorial Original Retro New
&rdquo; design &cbrack; worth a visit is its supply of retro-style wallpaper and
fabrics . Available in over 40 different patterns , MORN  ' s range of
wallpaper is inspired by the fun-loving flamboyance of the  '  60s and the  ' 
70s .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#18:1>
Expect to pay a lot more for this paper than the regular stuff tough
- prices start form &dollar;600 for 10m or &dollar;90 per meter .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#19:1>
Imported from France and Germany , they  ' re available in varying
degrees of loudness , with each pattern as unique and vibrant as the next .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#20:1>
Owner Wendy Lee recommends using the wallpaper to add character to a
room by applying it to a single wall . Because of the intensity of the
designs , applying the wallpaper to all four sides of a room can result in a
dizzying and claustrophobic effect - not the sort of look you  ' re probably
going for , especially in a small room . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#21:1>
MORN  ' s range of fabrics is also impressive .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#22:1>
If you spot a fabric that catches your eye , the shop can custom-make
a lampshade &obrack;  available in several sizes &cbrack; or even reupholster an entire sofa
for you .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#23:1>
Fabric prices start around &dollar;240 to &dollar;330 a year .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#24:1>
Fabrics and wallpaper aside , the shop also stocks an impressive
collection of ceiling lamps &obrack;  ranging in price from &dollar;230 to
&dollar;4,000 &cbrack; , all of which are in near mint condition - a point Lee
emphasizes , particularly for those interested in starting a collection .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#25:1>
If you  ' re around the area this week , be sure to drop in as there  ' s
a sale going on , which prices reduced up to 50 percent . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#26:1>
<bold> Faux Retro </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#27:1>
If you prefer to buy new furniture , but appreciate mid-century
modern designs , you could try D'Objets , a one month-old shop just a few
doors down from MORN .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#28:1>
Not only does this shop specialize in Chinese Art Deco furniture , it
also carries newly made pieces of furniture that have taken their reference
form designers form the  '  50s .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#29:1>
Elmwood cabinets &obrack;  currently reduced from &dollar;5,000 to
&dollar;3,500 &cbrack; inspired by Japanese-American designer George Nakashima are
especially practical , providing plenty of storage as well as being an
understated yet stylish solution to clutter .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#30:1>
All cabinets can be customized to suit your needs and are made of
solid wood . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#31:1>
If you  ' re scratching your head wondering why there are so few
charity shops around and no flea markets where you can find more of this
stuff , you might want to pick up a tip from Chan and scour rubbish dumps for
some true bargains .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#32:1>
Chan attributes the lack of second-hand stores to the Chinese
mentality of associating old or secondhand things as being " dirty . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#33:1>
Retro has deservedly earned its place in SoHo  ' s landscape of
cool - and apart from being perennially hip , furniture from the  '  50s ,  ' 
60s and  '  70s will always be associated with decadent and fun times .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#34:1>
While buying something made over 50 years ago may cost a lot more
than buying the equivalent piece brand new , the quality and character
represented in each piece are more than a match for the largely mass-produced
furniture so rampant in stores today . From the clean modernity of Charles
Eames , to the dizzying floral designs used on much of the soft furnishings
of the day , there  ' s something for everyone .

<bold> M </bold> any of us spend a lot of time and effort
scanning interior design magazines and department stores for large items such
as sofas , cabinets , beds , dressers and dining tables , but one element
that can either make or break your artfully chosen ensemble is that way you
light it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#43:2>
The right lighting can accentuate positive aspects of say , the
texture of your velvet settee , or take attention away from negative elements
, such as a room without a view &obrack;  a dramatic Gothic-style chandelier , for
example , can do this very nicely &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#44:2>
But whether you want to use it as a focal point or not , lighting
should always play an integral part of your room  ' s design . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#45:2>
<bold> Art Pieces </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#46:2>
Ming Ma , owner and designer of the avant-garde light shop &obrack;  the
word &ldquo; shop &rdquo; really doesn't do the place justice - it  ' s more of
a gallery &cbrack; <bold>  ' m  ' s Ma </bold> , follows no set rules .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#47:2>
His designs are an eclectic blend of bits and pieces collected over
the years , including antique lampshades , old pieces of glass , and other
materials .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#48:2>
Then , what began as a personal collection and hobby eventually led
him to set up a shop .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#49:2>
All of his pieces are one-offs , so if you  ' re a keen art collector
or simply want something totally unique , you  ' re in the right place to
splurge .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#50:2>
Prices range from &dollar;1,200 for a minimalist copper wire table
lamp to &dollar;6,000 for a gorgeous floor standing lamp made with strings of
white wool and finished with beads . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#51:2>
There  ' s an undeniably unique quality about each and every one of
Ma  ' s designs .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#52:2>
From conceptual forms to innovative materials - woollen string ,
twisted copper , parts of antique lamps and feathers - each piece us a work
of art in its own right .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#53:2>
The Jelly Fish &obrack;  &dollar;4,800 &cbrack; , for example , has a UFO-like shape
, supported by long curvy copper tentacles &obrack;  a seemingly favorite trademark
of Ma's &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#54:2>
The Dancing Feather &obrack;  &dollar;4,500 &cbrack; , meanwhile , is a simple yet
effective example of Ma  ' s creative use of materials and sensitivity to shape .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#55:2>
Apart from his own designs , Ma also carries lighting by three other
local artists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#56:2>
If you like the sound of unconventional lighting fixtures , you  ' ll
love what you see at <bold> D-D Furniture Ltd . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#57:2>
Don't let the dull name sway you; lights don't come more modern than
these .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#58:2>
Take the Luce d'Oro &obrack;  &dollar;5,500 &cbrack; as an example .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#59:2>
Composed of a large plate lined with silver leafing , the result is
somewhat reminiscent of a retired fire-breathing dragon with its scales
withered away .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#60:2>
Such delicate lighting is clearly only suited for an area of the
house that isn't exposed to any wind , humidity or drastic changes of
temperature - all of which could peel away the silver leafing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#61:2>
If that sounds like too much hard work , cast your eyes on Fil fe Fer
( &dollar;7,700 &cbrack; , a large ball-shaped tangle of fairy lights made of
aluminium wire .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#62:2>
The shop also carried an interesting assortment of lights by the
Italian company Catellani &ampersand; Smith , but be ready to spend for these . </p>

<bold> Kei Yip Lamps Co . Ltd . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#65:2>
Are sure to please .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#66:2>
A lot of the lighting here consists of generic and trendy options ,
such as stainless steel ceiling lights , track lights and sconces - all at a
reasonable price &obrack;  look to pay around &dollar;1,000 for a good-looking
ceiling light &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#67:2>
Nearby , at the funky homeware store <bold> Ei </bold> , the
emphasis is on color and style .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#68:2>
The lights don't have names &obrack;  unusual for a shop of this size and
standing &cbrack; , though there can be no mistake when identifying one of the store  ' s
top-selling items: a string of five orange-colored glass balls &obrack; 
&dollar;2,399 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#69:2>
Many of the designs are referenced from the  '  60s , and the shapes
are , therefore more playful and bold .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#70:2>
But rest assured , the store also caters to those who prefer
something more classic and minimalist , such as the six-legged ceiling light
made with stainless steel and frosted glass &obrack;  &dollar;1,099 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#72:2>
If you  ' re a self-confessed indiscriminate sucker for anything
designer , then the newly opened <bold> FLOS </bold> ought to light up more
than just your face .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#73:2>
Easily Italy  ' s most innovative and chic design house , FLOS has just
been creating masterpieces since 1962 , many of which now fall under the cult
umbrella , such as the Traxacum ceiling light or Phillipe Starck  ' s Arà table
tamp &obrack;  which he designed for FLOS in 1988 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#74:2>
Founding brothers Achille and Piergiacomo Castigliani are now
synonymous with modern lighting .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#75:2>
At the Hong Kong outlet , the more interesting pieces include the
Cicatricos Deluxe &obrack;  &dollar;24,560 &cbrack; , composed of five lead crystal decanters
balanced on a ledge .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#76:2>
This is both a witty , albeit decadent , lighting option .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#77:2>
If what you  ' re looking for is some soft mood lighting &obrack;  and you  ' re
tired of candles &cbrack; , take a look at the Taccia &obrack;  &dollar;11,200 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#78:2>
This is a space-age-looking glass diffuser floor lamp , set on a
metal base , ought to give you just the kind of subtle ambience lighting you
need for dinner parties , all the while giving off that coveted air of class .

<bold> Get a jumpstart on summer . </bold> </h> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-020#83:3>
<bold> T </bold> here  ' s an interesting group dynamic that takes
place in the summertime: There  ' s a large number of people who will do
anything to hide from the sun  ' s warming rays , and another group who will
expose every bit they legally can to absorb them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#84:3>
On one side are the people who layer at least three different kinds
of skin lightening lotions and sunblock , day and night , to shield
themselves from the UV rays .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#85:3>
Meanwhile , the other group goes in the opposite directions and does
whatever it takes to get that sexy tropical look - from using fake tanners to
going to tanning salons .

<ICE-HK:W2D-020#86:3>
If you belong to the second camp , and can't wait for the summertime
to get your tan going , here are some solariums that are open 12 months a
year to keep up that Hawaiian Tropic look . </p>

<p>
