<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#4:1>
<bold> TUNG CHEE-HWA </bold> is expected to outline his plan to
make his policy secretaries more accountable in his next Policy Address on
October 10 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#5:1>
However , even if the Chief Executive does replace his 16 civil
service bureau chiefs with political appointees , the public can hardly
expect heads to roll at Lower Albert Road the next time there is a major
blunder . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#6:1>
Given his conciliatory and indecisive character , Mr Tung is not
expected to wield the axe , even if he does now craft one for himself , after
having promised - in his October 2000 Policy Address - to move towards a
system of accountability for senior officials . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#7:1>
After all , he has so far not taken any firm action in response to
public pressure to remove any of his unpopular aides , even though it is
within his power to do so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#8:1>
The Hong Kong Examinations Authority &obrack;  HKEA &cbrack; offered the latest
example of this . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#9:1>
On July 8 , <it> Ming Pao </it> newspaper ran an editorial
highlighting the many oversights allegedly committed by the body  ' s secretary
Choi Chee-cheong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#10:1>
&ldquo; The HKEA  ' s head ought to resign , &rdquo; it concluded ,
&ldquo; lest exam candidates should again be victimised . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#11:1>
The daily carried another hard-hitting editorial the next day ,
lashing out at HKEA chairman Joseph Chow Ming-kuen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#12:1>
The paper called for a complete overhaul of the authority .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#13:1>
But Mr Tung was apparently so satisfied with Dr Chow  ' s leadership
that it was announced on July 20 that he had been awarded another two-year
term of office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#14:1>
The past couple of years have seen repeated calls in the media
for the dismissal of various high officials , without any action by Mr Tung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#15:1>
As an example , Mr Tung failed to respond when Albert Cheng King-hon
on his talk-back show recently called for the resignation of the Secretary
for Civil Service Joseph Wong Wing-ping , who had initially refused to
release his bureau  ' s internal report over the disappearance of autistic boy
Yu Man-hon , who slipped through the Lowu border crossing last year and is
still missing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#16:1>
The Chief Executive is apparently so accustomed to such outbursts
that he does not normally bother to react .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#17:1>
However , the case of former Housing Authority chairperson Rosanna
Wong Yick-ming proved a rare exception . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#18:1>
When she decided to bow out last year under mounting political
pressure over a piling scandal , Mr Tung was said to have asked her to stay
put .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#19:1>
In any case , Mr Tung soon found her a new role at the helm of
Education Commission . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#20:1>
This means that the Hong Kong SAR is lagging far behind its
counterparts on the mainland , as far as holding officials to account is
concerned . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#21:1>
In 1995 , the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
issued a set of interim guidelines on the promotion of cadres in both the
party and state bureaucracies . Dubbed &ldquo; Memo Number Five" , the
document stipulated that systems under which officials were required to take
the blame and resign needed to be put in place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#22:1>
Since then , many local governments have already installed schemes to
hold office bearers accountable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#23:1>
Section chiefs and department heads in the Longgang district in
Shenzhen , for example , can be removed through internal ballots . Even the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has recently implemented a similar system .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#24:1>
All eyes will now be on Mr Tung to see if he can measure up to
the rest of China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#25:1>
But the chances are high that even if he does put together some form
of disciplinary stick , he may not have the determination to wield it . </p>

<bold> Highway robbery as SAR tourists ` Go West ' </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#30:2>
<bold> THE 1,970-KILOMETRE </bold> Qinghai-Tibet highway ,
traversing the world  ' s highest plateau , plays a major role in China  ' s
high-profile &ldquo; Go West &rdquo; campaign .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#31:2>
However , as travellers can testify , this lifeline of Tibet is
infested with gangsters - some of them , it would appear , in uniforms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#32:2>
There have been reports of trucks being used to block the highway
near the Tibetan borders .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#33:2>
Drivers are blackmailed into paying 100 yuan &obrack;  about HK&dollar;94)
each , before being allowed to pass . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#34:2>
The local authorities are apparently aware of the problem but
have refrained from taking any decisive action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#35:2>
Three weeks ago , a group of six Hong Kong tourists witnessed a
couple of armed police officers doubling as &ldquo; highway robbers" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#36:2>
The group were among two dozen passengers , most of them foreigners ,
on a bus travelling from Golmud in Qinghai province . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#37:2>
One of the group from Hong Kong told me that after a bumpy ride
of over 49 hours , they found themselves approaching the Tibetan end of the
highway , where traffic started to pile up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#38:2>
They later found out that two trucks guarded by two men in
armed-police uniform were blocking both sides of the road , leaving just
enough room in the middle for small cars to go through one at a time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#39:2>
The officers claimed that they were carrying orders to block
larger vehicles from using the road .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#40:2>
In reality , only drivers who handed them money were allowed to
continue with their journeys , irrespective of the size of their vehicle .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#41:2>
The bus driver complied , but the group still had to wait for
hours before the officers moved their trucks further aside .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#42:2>
They appeared to be worried that other large vehicles could take the
opportunity to dash through without paying .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#43:2>
The two were prepared to open the gap wider when there was less
traffic approaching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#44:2>
During the stand-off , a public security patrol car drove by .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#45:2>
The tourists eagerly complained about the anomaly , to no avail .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#46:2>
When they finally approached Lhasa , they were forced to stop again .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#47:2>
This time they were confronted by several bulldozers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#48:2>
A man holding a brick told them that section of the road was off
limits to outside vehicles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#49:2>
The driver was worried the man would break the windshield of his bus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#50:2>
Another stand-off ensued . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#51:2>
What happened to the group is not an isolated case .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#52:2>
Complaints about similar incidents have started to appear in the Hong
Kong press in the past couple of weeks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#53:2>
The central Government has certainly put a lot of effort into
improving this artery for Tibet over the years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#54:2>
At the National People  ' s Congress this year , Premier Zhu Rongji
promised to earmark more state funds for infrastructure schemes in the
midwestern region over the next five years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#55:2>
Further development of the Qinghai-Tibet link was named as one of
the three priorities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#56:2>
The Qinghai-Tibet connection is regarded as crucial for easing the
financial plights of farmers and herdsman in the autonomous region , who earn
an average of less than &dollar;4 a day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#57:2>
Earlier this month , the Tibet authorities invited Hong Kong
journalists to visit the region .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#58:2>
In a bid to boost tourism , local cadres even pledged to do away with
the formality for Hong Kong residents to apply for a permit to enter Tibet .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#59:2>
Top officials have been enthusiastically mapping out long-term
plans for Tibet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#60:2>
However , much of their well-intended efforts to attract visitors and
investors will be wasted , if their security units cannot keep their own
house in order to ensure a free and safe passage into Lhasa . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#65:3>
<bold> THE MEDIA HAS </bold> been peppered with speculative
reports on who will become ministers under Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa  ' s
new ministerial system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#66:3>
Some of them have contradicted not only reports in rival
newspapers but also reports of their own .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#67:3>
News organisations will , however , get their report cards soon as
the line-up is scheduled to be unveiled this week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#68:3>
Finding out the names of the new ministers ahead of the formal
announcement has little to do with public interest as these conjectures are
merely games for competing journalists to reaffirm their professional
self-esteem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#69:3>
The fourth estate has been degraded into a willing accomplice in
the process by rushing to amplify unconfirmed tidbits in the hope of scooping
each other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#70:3>
It would be far more enlightening if reporters compared notes and
pieced together information they have been fed and the reasons for having
been given it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#71:3>
This would give readers a rare glimpse into how things work in the
corridors of power . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#72:3>
This , however , is highly unlikely under the pretext of
protecting the identities of their anonymous sources .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#73:3>
<it> Ming Pao </it> came up with a list last week , claiming that the
new cabinet would include 20 members . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#74:3>
The article was based on an account by a person &ldquo; who has
talked face-to-face with the Chief Executive on the subject" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#75:3>
Citing unnamed sources a few days later , ATV aired a rehash of the
rumours that the cabinet would be made up of 20 members . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#76:3>
Similar to reports carried by the <it> Economic Times </it> and
<it> Ming Pao </it> that day , the TV station also stated that Arthur Li
Kwok-cheung would give up his post as the head of the Chinese University to
take over the government education portfolio . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#77:3>
Those reports yesterday were rejected by <it> Sing Tao Daily
</it> , which reported that the cabinet would have 25 or 26 members .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#78:3>
Thirteen of them are supposed to be new blood . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#79:3>
The paper noted: &ldquo; It remains highly probable that the
Chinese University  ' s Vice-Chancellor will replace Mrs Fanny Law Fan
Chiu-fun as secretary for education . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#80:3>
But the paper itself did not appear to be positive about what it
had carried .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#81:3>
In the same breath , the daily contradicted itself: &ldquo; Sources
said the chances of Professor Li serving as secretary for education are close
to zero . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#82:3>
It went on to say he had told the paper he would retire from the
university by 2005 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#83:3>
The daily claimed to have obtained a name list , which showed
that incumbent Rosanna Wong Yick-ming would stay despite earlier reports that
claimed otherwise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#84:3>
It further ran against the tide by insisting that Lingnan University
President Edward Chen Kwan-yiu was still in the race . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#85:3>
The media , meanwhile , has reached a general consensus on who
some of the other newcomers will be .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#86:3>
The managing director of EHS Consultants , Sarah Liao Sau-dong , is
tipped to become secretary for environment , transport and works . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#87:3>
Patrick Ho Chi-ping , who heads the Arts Development Council , is
tipped to take over the Home Affairs Bureau , while Pacific Century
CyberWorks executive director Frederick Ma Si-hang looks set to become
secretary for financial services and the treasury . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#88:3>
Now that the guesswork stage will soon be over , it is imperative
for the media to prove it is capable of focusing on the substance of the
ministers ' future policies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#89:3>
After all , the new faces do not have an established track record in
government administration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#94:4>
<bold> DEBATES IN THE </bold> Legislative Council fall into two
categories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#95:4>
There are the non-contentious debates , in which no one needs to win
over anyone; and there are the contentious ones , in which no one is able to
win over anyone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#96:4>
Legco is divided roughly into two blocs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#97:4>
The media usually refer to one of them as &ldquo; pro-China" ,
&ldquo; pro-Beijing &rdquo; or &ldquo; pro-government" , and the other as
&ldquo; pro-democracy &rdquo; or &ldquo; oppositionist" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#98:4>
The blocs themselves prefer to call each other by more emotive names .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#99:4>
Most Legco members belong to one of these blocs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#100:4>
Those who deny affiliation are regarded more often as chameleons
than real independents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#101:4>
Debates are mainly between the two blocs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#102:4>
Members from either side can make passionate and forceful speeches ,
but they never convince the other side .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#103:4>
Nor is there ever any intention to convince .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#104:4>
It is widely acknowledged that no matter what is said , the
pro-government bloc will unthinkingly rubber-stamp any government proposal ,
while the opposition will indiscriminately say no . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#105:4>
Sometimes , when Legco is dealing with an issue on which public
opinion seems unanimous , there may be genuine discussion , apparently with
no predetermined position to defend .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#106:4>
But the moment a government motion is brought , both sides
immediately polarise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#107:4>
An example is the dispute over the civil service pay-cut bill .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#108:4>
Most legislators , with the exception of a few from trade unions ,
agree the salaries of civil servants should be reduced , at least by the
rates the Government has proposed according to its pay trend survey results .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#109:4>
As to whether a law should be passed to make the reduction
legally unchallengeable , political parties initially showed a readiness to
confer with both the Government and civil service unions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#110:4>
My party , the consistently pro-government Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong &obrack;  DAB &cbrack; , raised doubts about the need to
legislate and whether it would be consistent with the Basic Law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#111:4>
The groups habitually in the opposition - the Democratic Party
and The Frontier , did not immediately reject the idea of passing a pay-cut
law .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#112:4>
But as soon as it became apparent the Government was determined to
legislate to shield itself from legal action , Legco quickly reverted to its
two blocs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#113:4>
No longer was there room for open-minded deliberation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#114:4>
Academic discussions gave way to uncompromising positions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#115:4>
The DAB pledged support for the Government  ' s legislative proposal .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#116:4>
The Frontier turned inexorably against it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#117:4>
The Democratic Party said it was willing to consider legislation ,
but certainly not in the form of the government bill , which it found
unacceptable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#118:4>
The Legco debate on the pay-cut bill will take place in about
two weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#119:4>
Now that everybody has resumed usual positions , little intellectual
content can be expected in the debate , which will be no more than a pre-vote
ritual , a final chance for the blocs to hurl accusations at the opposite
side . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#120:4>
In many cases there is not even a brief period of rational
dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#121:4>
With constitutional or political issues , such as the Government  ' s
proposed ministerial system for principal officials , polarisation in Legco
takes place from the start . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#122:4>
As soon as Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa unveiled the
ministerial package in mid-April , legislators in the anti-Government bloc
launched a vehement attack .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#123:4>
They called it a misnomer and a sham . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#124:4>
They believed it was Mr Tung  ' s plot to grab more power by
removing honest civil servants from top government posts and filling them
with his cronies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#125:4>
They told the public it was a constitutional change that would make
Mr Tung a dictator . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#126:4>
They chastised the Government for the haste with which it tried
to push the package through Legco , although they made it no secret they
would never endorse it no matter how much time was available for scrutiny .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#127:4>
They were disgusted with Legco &ldquo; royalists &rdquo; who
never seemed concerned about the Government  ' s disregard for the legislature
or for due legislative process . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#128:4>
The pro-government members , however , vowed support even before
the details of the scheme were revealed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-015#129:4>
They were convinced the reform would remedy existing defects in the
bureaucratic system and lead to a more efficient and accountable government .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#130:4>
They had little patience for criticism from the opposition ,
dismissing it as mud slinging or stalling tactics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#131:4>
The oppositionists would not be satisfied with any answer from
the Government and fruitless debates would last as long as they were allowed
to repeat themselves , according to the pro-government side . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-015#132:4>
Division into irreconcilable blocs is perhaps not peculiar to
our Legco , but is it worth spending endless hours on debate if everyone
knows it would only make both sides harden their positions ? </p>
