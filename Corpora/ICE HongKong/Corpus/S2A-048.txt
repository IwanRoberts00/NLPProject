<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-048#1:1:A>
<?> Candidate </?> have a factor competitive act over their <,>
uhm general competitors

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#2:1:A>
The salaries uh generally <?> affected </?> about twelve to thirteen
thousand a month

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#3:1:A>
They are now absorbed into different employment sectors uh it

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#4:1:A>
Now this is a general picture

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#5:1:A>
Okay I  ' ll go on to <,> another area <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#6:1:A>
Now I use Hong Kong U graduates  '  employment situation as a case

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#7:1:A>
I  ' ll go on to today  ' s topic of how <,> they are going to maintain
<,,> what <,> their employment competitiveness <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#8:1:A>
Uh that is <,,> <unc> three words </unc> <&> A long pause
</&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#9:1:A>
Now I  ' ll use Hong Kong U graduates  '  employment situation as a case
to illustrate what local graduates can do to maintain their competitive edge

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#10:1:A>
It is today  ' s main theme

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#11:1:A>
Now before <,> you are going to consider <,> how <,> uh local
graduates can maintain their edge over their competitors

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#12:1:A>
Then first of all you need to understand the current
characteristics of the current economic scene

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#13:1:A>
Because employment and economic are closely related

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#14:1:A>
Before you are going to analyse the employment situation you have
to understand the current economic situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#15:1:A>
Then a three major characteristics <,> nowadays in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#16:1:A>
The first <,,> is globalization

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#17:1:A>
Globalization is the first characteristic in today  ' s economic
scene

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#18:1:A>
That <?> mean </?> the economic competition is not just <,>
<unc> one-word </unc> on or original bases

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#19:1:A>
In fact it is going on for a worldwide bases on an international
bases

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#20:1:A>
Alright this is the first characteristic

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#21:1:A>
The second characteristic <,,> knowledge economy that is <,> the
economy current economy is based on specialized knowledge and advanced
technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#22:1:A>
This is the second characteristic

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#23:1:A>
The third characteristic <,,> is the rapid economic development of
mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#24:1:A>
The current Hong Kong economic scene are dominated by these three
<,> major characteristic

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#25:1:A>
<?> This </?> is the globalization knowledge economy and rapid
economic development of mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#26:1:A>
Now you have to have such a general picture before you go on to <,>
<?> think </?> an the employment scene

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#27:1:A>
Now these three <,> major characteristics bring about challenges as
well as opportunities

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#28:1:A>
Now what are the challenges because of the characteristic

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#29:1:A>
Uhm first <,> globalization

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#30:1:A>
What challenges does it bring about

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#31:1:A>
Now more intensive competition because of globalization <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#32:1:A>
Employers or enterprises will have to <?> climb </?> for their
survival

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#33:1:A>
They have to compete for survival

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#34:1:A>
They are aiming at higher productivity at lower cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#35:1:A>
That is they have to <,> cut their cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#36:1:A>
And to increase productivity at the same time

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#37:1:A>
That is to do more with less

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#38:1:A>
It  ' s very difficult but it is the situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#39:1:A>
Alright so everywhere you can see that you need to enhance your
productivity at even lower cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#40:1:A>
This is the characteristic the lower cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#41:1:A>
You also to survive otherwise and not survive so your <unc>
one-word </unc> will end up in bankruptcy or in uhm <,> uhm liquidation
and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#42:1:A>
This is the first challenge that globalization that will bring
about

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#43:1:A>
The second challenge <,> is knowledge <,> economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#44:1:A>
What challenges that is the employer <,> they will need higher
academic qualification because it is uh the job requirement will become
higher and higher

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#45:1:A>
They require employer they require higher academic qualification
and higher level of confidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#46:1:A>
I mean is to meet the requirement of the job

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#47:1:A>
Not just academic qualification you need higher qualification

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#48:1:A>
You need uh better qualification that is uh almost academic
qualification

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#49:1:A>
But the employer will look at other qualities in addition to your
certificate in addition to your paper <?> conviction </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#50:1:A>
This is the what we call higher level of <?> confidence </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#51:1:A>
Later on I  ' ll elaborate on <,> what  ' s meant by higher level of
<?> confidence </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#52:1:A>
This is the second challenge that it will bring about

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#53:1:A>
The third challenge <,> because of rapid economic development of
mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#54:1:A>
What challenge <,> does it bring about

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#55:1:A>
That is the increasing number of industrial and commercial
organization they  ' re moving northward

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#56:1:A>
Alright over the past ten <&> tut </&> twenty years

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#57:1:A>
All of you know that commerce and maybe commercial industrial
organization moving to the mainland because the labour cost <,> is lower

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#58:1:A>
The land cost is lower

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#59:1:A>
It  ' s closely related with globalization

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#60:1:A>
Then because of the moving of the uhm commercial and industrial
corporations northwards

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#61:1:A>
It will bring about <,> unemployment immediate redundancy in
immediate replacement in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#62:1:A>
Everyday you can read <,> an a newspaper you can watch <,> from the
television that many people become <?> unemploy </?> because of their
operations are moving northward

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#63:1:A>
These are the challenges <,> brought about by the three major <.>
char </.> characteristics of an economy scene

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#64:1:A>
But at the same time it  ' s not so gloomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#65:1:A>
These characteristic will also bring about <,> opportunities

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#66:1:A>
Now these opportunity are based on economic restructuring

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#67:1:A>
The Hong Kong  ' s economy is changing

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#68:1:A>
It  ' s basically that whole structure is changing

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#69:1:A>
It  ' s called economic restructuring and transformation

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#70:1:A>
If you can live up to the requirement of the transformation then
you can survive

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#71:1:A>
If there are opportunities if you cannot live up to you cannot
catch up with the transformation then probably you are facing great
difficulties

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#72:1:A>
Now opportunity the first <,> globalization

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#73:1:A>
China  ' s a section to the WTO World Trade Organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#74:1:A>
Now China has join WTO and because China  ' s a section to WTO

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#75:1:A>
Many foreign investment will come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#76:1:A>
Because they will try to use Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#77:1:A>
They will set up offices in Hong Kong in order to serve as a <?>
gate </?> to the vast <?> mass </?> vast employment uh vast <,> uh business
market in the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#78:1:A>
Alright the vast population uh uhm <,> uhm one thousand <,> three
hundred billion people

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#79:1:A>
So vast <,> uh business opportunity

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#80:1:A>
Okay this  ' s the first opportunity

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#81:1:A>
The second one Hong Kong  ' s unique position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#82:1:A>
Uh geographical proximity Hong Kong is so near to the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#83:1:A>
And not just geographical proximity how <.> cons </.> how <.> terr
</.> economic social and <?> politics </?> link with the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#84:1:A>
Place local graduate in a unique position to be one of their
potential and to develop their strength

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#85:1:A>
This is a <,> very unique position opportunity arrive <,> from John
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#86:1:A>
John <unc> one-word </unc> it is is the <unc> one-word
</unc> capital uhm <unc> one-word </unc> between Hong Kong <,>
entrepreneur and Chinese on the mainland entrepreneur

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#87:1:A>
Uh there are several important scene important finance uhm career
fields which may offer opportunity for graduate

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#88:1:A>
Particularly finance trade transport communication energy
innovation technology innovative technology and tourism

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#89:1:A>
These are the scenes that many local categories join hands with <,>
categories from uhm mainland in order to develop business

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#90:1:A>
This is the second opportunity

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#91:1:A>
And later on from this opportunity you will know that you need to
learn better Putonghua better Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#92:1:A>
Alright later on I  ' ll go on to call <unc> one-word </unc>
and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#93:1:A>
To relate my comment to <,> uh the situation opportunity okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#94:1:A>
The third one that is opportunity is the <?> exist </?> Hong Kong
<,> SAR Government

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#95:1:A>
Hong Kong SAR Government  ' s initiative to invest <,> to promote
investment and to invest in a lot of infrastructure in several field high
technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#96:1:A>
The total amount probably all you have read from the newspaper six
hundred billion <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#97:1:A>
Six hundred billion in the near future in mutli media application
in Chinese medicine in tourism in infrastructure <,> railways MTR and so on
help to create a wide rate of autonomous opportunities for graduate with good
professional knowledge

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#98:1:A>
Not just for everybody but graduate particularly with good
professional knowledge <,> local experience and a high level of proficiency
in both English and Chinese languages <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#99:1:A>
Every year the Career Centre conduct surveys to collect information
collect it back from employer

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#100:1:A>
Later on we  ' ll look at what do employer expect from those <?>
grad </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#101:1:A>
These are the scene I  ' ll <?> object </?> the scene for you

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#102:1:A>
Uh ha about the general employment situation about the current
economic <,> characteristic about the challenges it bring about

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#103:1:A>
And about the <,> opportunities that <?> brings </?> economic
characteristic will bring about to the people come from

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#104:1:A>
Now then let look at <,,> another area <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#105:1:A>
What would local graduate do to enhance the whole person
development

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#106:1:A>
As I mention I think early the employers are expecting more and
more from a candidate if you apply for a job

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#107:1:A>
Many years ago most employer will just look at the paper <?>
conviction </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#108:1:A>
Okay if you have a a degree if you have diploma certificate and so
on they will take you on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#109:1:A>
They assume that you can perform the job well

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#110:1:A>
But nowadays they will look at some other aspects

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#111:1:A>
You that look at the whole <?> version </?> other skills as well
uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#112:1:A>
There are seven things <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#113:1:A>
Local graduate have to do seven thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#114:1:A>
Uh later I  ' ll elaborate one by one

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#115:1:A>
The first <,> you need to acquire the better understanding of
mainland China <,> as related to my uhm previous elaboration on opportunity
economic development opportunity in the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#116:1:A>
If you are going to take up employment if you are going to <,> uh
develop your career in the mainland you

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#117:1:A>
The basic <,> thing is to acquire a better understanding of
mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#118:1:A>
This is the first thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#119:1:A>
The second thing <,> that normal graduate will need to do <,> is
<,> global perspective international perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#120:1:A>
You have to widen your horizon

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#121:1:A>
If you just uh spend all your time in Hong Kong probably you maybe
not be sufficient to meet employer  ' s expectation global perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#122:1:A>
Number three <,,> you need to develop <unc> two-words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#123:1:A>
Not just paper <?> conviction </?> you need to enhance your
<unc> two-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#124:1:A>
Later on I  ' ll elaborate what meant by <unc> two-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#125:1:A>
That these are all the requirements by employers

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#126:1:A>
Number four <,> language proficiency

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#127:1:A>
Okay improve language proficiency

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#128:1:A>
Number five <,> need to do <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#129:1:A>
Practical work experience

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#130:1:A>
Before you graduate if you are about to enter university uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#131:1:A>
It  ' s time for you to make use of the summer vacation

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#132:1:A>
The first year summer vacation second year summer vacation to
acquire some practical work experience to clear and specific career
perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#133:1:A>
You cannot just spend all your time on your books

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#134:1:A>
You have to acquire practical work experience before you graduate

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#135:1:A>
This is the number five

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#136:1:A>
Number six <,,> show commitment to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#137:1:A>
Local graduate have a <?> edge </?> over their competitors over
<,> candidate from other sources being that

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#138:1:A>
They show the commitment to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#139:1:A>
If you grow up here you develop your careers here

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#140:1:A>
You show your commitment to Hong Kong employer <?> if you say that
</?> commitment to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#141:1:A>
And <,> last but not least is very important <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#142:1:A>
To develop positive work attitude

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#143:1:A>
Good work attitude and a high sense of responsibility

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#144:1:A>
If you local graduates are able to develop themselves in all these
seven areas they can definitely maintain their competitive edge even in the
face of unemployment in the face of <,> lot of challenges from all quarters

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#145:1:A>
This my seven

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#146:1:A>
Now I  ' m going to elaborate one by one from A to G these seven
points <,> okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#147:1:A>
A <&> tut </&> acquire better understanding of mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#148:1:A>
What do we need

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#149:1:A>
How <,> how are you going to do it

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#150:1:A>
Now it  ' s in fact it  ' s not particularly difficult

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#151:1:A>
First of all <,> participate in China related project

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#152:1:A>
In fact when you enter <,> the local <.> univers </.> one of the
local university

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#153:1:A>
In fact all local university are organizing a lot of activities
China <?> relate </?> related activities for their students <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#154:1:A>
Make full use of this opportunity

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#155:1:A>
China related project seminars study tour programme to enhance
your knowledge of the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#156:1:A>
Understand mainland  ' s economic social and administrative system

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#157:1:A>
Because later on when you develop your career here even if you
work in Hong Kong you may work in in hand in with people from <,> mainland
China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#158:1:A>
Then you need to understand mainland economic social
administrative system

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#159:1:A>
Try to participate in the project

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#160:1:A>
Okay this is the first thing okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#161:1:A>
Second uh <,,> <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#162:1:A>
Try to undertake a short period of employment or training in the
mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#163:1:A>
To understand the work environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#164:1:A>
This is the more theoretical part

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#165:1:A>
The seminar <,> study tour programme and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#166:1:A>
The second part is the work environment and establish contacts

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#167:1:A>
For instance the <,> Career Centre Hong Kong U every year arranges
a number of student to take up summer employment in the mainland

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#168:1:A>
What we call China <unc> one-word </unc> programme

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#169:1:A>
They work there for uh two month two and a half month and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#170:1:A>
Then <,> they understand better the work environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#171:1:A>
It  ' s difficult even if you explain to them in great detail it may
not be sufficient

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#172:1:A>
You work there for two month then may know

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#173:1:A>
And then establish contacts

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#174:1:A>
This  ' s very important because employer will appreciate the <?>
period </?> of contact with the student to understand their potential their
skills and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#175:1:A>
This is the second <?> thing </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#176:1:A>
Third <,> every day by paying attention to China related current
affairs in Hong Kong in the mainland and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#177:1:A>
Alright because two places are so closely related

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#178:1:A>
Current China Chinese affair or current affair in China will
affect Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#179:1:A>
Then it  ' s the time analysis how this issue affect Hong Kong
development

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#180:1:A>
This is the <,> <?> first </?> point

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#181:1:A>
How do local graduate maintain their competitiveness with without
understanding <,> of mainland China

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#182:1:A>
The second point B <,> global perspective global perspective
alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#183:1:A>
You have to look beyond Hong Kong look beyond <,> China look
beyond Asia and then in fact you look it up you look at the whole world

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#184:1:A>
How

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#185:1:A>
Now again <,> all local university organize <,> exchange
programmes for their student to undertake a period of study in oversea
universities

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#186:1:A>
Or uhm they may study there for <,> uh as a less than three two
three months

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#187:1:A>
They may study for whole year that <,,> <?> attraction </?> is
that you study in a foreign environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#188:1:A>
Then you have opportunity to experience independent living that
all by own

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#189:1:A>
And study in a foreign environment communicate and interact with
people of a different language different culture and different customs okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#190:1:A>
Uh for instance Hong Kong U organizes the worldwide <,> Hong Kong
alright not Hong Kong U worldwide

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#191:1:A>
That is different campuses <,> rearrange student to different
campuses in different part of the world

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#192:1:A>
They may study in the United States uh in Europe or in uh <,> uhm
U United Kingdom and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#193:1:A>
This is the first area

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#194:1:A>
The second area to acquire global perspective is <,> to join study
tour

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#195:1:A>
Again <,> many of uh student societies many teaching departments
uh student affairs units and so on or different local universities organize
seminars conferences held outside Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#196:1:A>
So when you enter these local universities if you have opportunity
by all means try to attend <,> to participate in the seminar the conferences
held outside Hong Kong to understand <,> and appreciate different view from
different perspective

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#197:1:A>
This is important

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#198:1:A>
To broaden your mental horizon

<ICE-HK:S2A-048#199:1:A>
