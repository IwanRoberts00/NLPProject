natural for you <,> to <,> to be born in <,> Japan too <{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#47:1:A>
You </[2> know what I mean

Uhm <,> in fact my mom didn't want to get married in that age cos

She didn't want to <,> get married you see and uh <,> my dad was
smoking at that moment and uh <,> she hates smoking <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#97:1:A>

<{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

Naughty boys <&> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#121:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X125:1:Z>

their actions their <,> behaviour <{> <[> <,> </[> is that so

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#132:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X165:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#166:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#167:1:A>
That  ' s why <,> I <,> I think uh <,> she really looks like a
Chinese rather than a <{> <[> Japanese </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X168:1:Z>
<[> She </[> </{> she is Chinese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#169:1:A>
Uh huh <,> so uhm <,> when you communicate uh so but your <,>
your brothers can speak uh Cantonese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X170:1:Z>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X171:1:Z>
<{> <[> He </[> speaks <,> he speaks uhm Dutch <,> English <,>
and Chinese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#172:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#173:1:A>
Wow three language <,> trilingual

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#174:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X175:1:Z>
He he doesn't <,> he doesn't speak <.> J </.> Japanese <,>
fluently as uhm <,> my brother and I because <{1> <[1> <,> he </[1> <,> he
sort of uhm <,> grew up separate separately <,> <{2> <[2> with </[2> from us
because uhm he went to school I think he went to school in Europe when he was
<,> really young </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#176:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#177:1:A>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#178:1:A>
Oh I see <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#179:1:A>
So uhm <,> he has his education in Belgium that  ' s why <,> uhm <,>
he <,> speaks less fluently than <,> <{> <[> you </[> and your <,> younger
brother

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X180:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X181:1:Z>
I guess I guess that  ' s the reason </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#182:1:A>
Uhm we forgot something <&> break-in-recording </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#183:1:A>
Okay

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X184:1:Z>
So what are your plans after you graduate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#185:1:A>
Well uh actually I didn't think about it seriously <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#186:1:A>
Really <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#187:1:A>
Really I didn't think about it seriously <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#188:1:A>
Uhm <,> I myself <,> want to do something in the business field
<,> uh in the commerce or <,> even PR <,> the public relations <{1> <[1>
field <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#189:1:A>
Uh you see uhm <,> I  ' m not graduated in the BBA <,> Department or
<,> some other Economics or Finance <,> so I think I may be <,,> uhm <,> less
<,> advantageous than other <,> uh Economic or BBA students cos <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> I am only doing language courses Translation not <,> uh <,> something
about Economic or Finance

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#190:1:A>
Well maybe language is uhm <,> well it  ' s good for some business
<,> because uhm <,> some business will require <,> the applicants with uh <,>
good language skills uhm uh <,> or <,> acquire <,> some other languages like
uh Japanese or <,> French something like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#191:1:A>
But uhm <,> that  ' s not <,> much for us <,> you see

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#192:1:A>
Somebody uhm not somebody uhm many people think that we have <,> a
very <,> good prospectus <,> prospects for translation because uh translation
is <,> getting much popular <{3> <[3> <,> in </[3> Hong Kong now

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#193:1:A>
But uhm I don't agree with them because uhm <,> you can see from
the outside <,> reaction from the employers that uhm <,> that  ' s not <,>
there  ' s not a very <,> big demand for <,> translation students

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#194:1:A>
Besides we are not the only translation graduates in Hong Kong
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4> uh there are also <,> uh some graduates from Polytechnics
<,> and <,> they are popular

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#195:1:A>
They are more popular than us because <,> uh their courses their
syllabus is more practical <,> than <,> those in <,> the Hong Kong U

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#196:1:A>
That  ' s why the employers will <,> uhm think they are more capable
than us

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X197:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X198:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X199:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X200:1:Z>
<[4> Uh huh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X201:1:Z>
How different <,> how different are the courses <,> compared to
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#202:1:A>
Well you see uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#203:1:A>
I think uh the first year students <,> in translation this year
<,> are <,> luckier than us because uh in our first year <,> we <,,> did a
lot of uh literary <,> translation <,> which is uh not very <,> practical
indeed

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#204:1:A>
You see <,> no one will <,> uh pay you uh eight thousand dollars
to <&> laughs </&> to uhm <,> for you to uh translate uh <O> three words in
Cantonese </O> or <,> some other uh Chinese literary works for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#205:1:A>
They will ask you to translate uh journalisms <,> uh journals uh
<,> newspapers <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh some uh <,> telegraphs for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#206:1:A>
That  ' s something practical <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#207:1:A>
We are not doing something practical but rather literary you see
<,> and that  ' s not very good for us because uh <,> we may not be <,> as
competitive as those of uh Polytechnics because they did a lot of uh <,> uh
newspapers journals <,,> sort <{2> <[2> of uh practical </[2> works you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X208:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X209:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X210:1:Z>
But if you did <,> if you practise a lot in translating
literature uhm <,> it <,> won't that be an advantage if you try and look for
a job <,> like for uhm <,> a publisher <,> you know translating <,> uh <,>
English book into Chinese <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> stuff like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X211:1:Z>
Because <,> uhm <,> I know a lady in Japan <,> she started out
translating uhm <,,> English into Japanese for uhm <,> children <,> children  ' s
<{2> <[2> book </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X212:1:Z>
And then <,> later on she <,,> I think all the uhm <,> movies
foreign movies <,> especially American movies <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> they ask
her to uhm <,> <{4> <[4> translate </[4> it for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X213:1:Z>
You know <,> you know sometimes they have subtitles <{5> <[5> <,>
</[5> in the bottom

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X214:1:Z>
This <,> uhm I think she does most of the movies in Japan <{6>
<[6> <,> </[6> into Japanese

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X215:1:Z>
English into Japanese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#216:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#217:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#218:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#219:1:A>
<[4> Translate </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#220:1:A>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#221:1:A>
<[6> Oh </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#222:1:A>
Ah <,> but because uhm <,,> because I heard that uhm <,> many
Japanese uh <,> do not have a very high level of uh English <,> <{1> <[1> so
</[1> that  ' s why they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#223:1:A>
Well <,> there are many courses uh <,> English courses for
Japanese but <,> uh <,> some people say that <,> they still have some Japan
accent or <,> uhm there are not <,> many <,> Japanese in Japan who can speak
fluent English and <,> write <,> good <,> English <,> is that right <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#224:1:A>
That  ' s why <,> uh such kind of uh translators <,> may become very
popular very <,,> uhm <,,> well <,> demanded by the <,,> <{3> <[3> movie
</[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X225:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X226:1:Z>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X227:1:Z>
<[3> I </[> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X228:1:Z>
See I <,> I  ' m not I  ' m not really sure cos I  ' ve never been to a
Japanese school but <,> this is what I heard from my Japanese friends <{> <[>
<,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X229:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> they <,> they take uhm <,> they take English
courses <,> from uhm <,,> uhm <,> from seventh grade <{1> <[1> until </[1>
until they graduate at twelfth grade so that  ' s six years <,> of <,>
education in English but <,,> what they study is <,> most of the time <,> is
like they study grammar and uh <,> written English instead of spoken <.> Engl
</.> English <{2> <[2> so they don't </[2> really have a chance to practise
their uhm <.> s </.> their <{3> <[3> speaking <,,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X230:1:Z>
<.> s </.> <,> I think that  ' s <,> why <,> they say they <,> when
they speak English they have <{4> <[4> a </[4> weird accent <,> but be <,>
but uhm <,> when I was in college in <,> in the States <,> uhm <,> a lot of
people that I took classes <,> Japanese students <,> they write papers <,>
better than I did and <,> they <,> they have a <,> wide range of vocabularies
they use </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#231:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#232:1:A>
<[2> Oh I see </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#233:1:A>
<[3> Spoken

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#234:1:A>
Uh huh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#235:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#236:1:A>
Because they have more practice in uh <,> <{> <[> written <,>
English </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X237:1:Z>
<[> Written <,> English </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X238:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#239:1:A>
Well I think so <,> because uh when I was in my <,>
matriculation <,> uh there was once a <,> a team of uh <,> Japanese students
coming to our <.> s </.> to our school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X240:1:Z>
Exchange student </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#241:1:A>
Yeah <,> and uh <,> just for one-day visit <,> and uh we <,>
we had to be their <,> host and <,> to bring them around <,> the <,> <{> <[>
school <,> </[> campus <,> and uh I found that they are <,> they  ' re <,> they  ' re
<,> they  ' re sort of difficult to express themselves <,,> express themselves
clearly <,> I mean

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#242:1:A>
Uhm <,> they really want to say something but they <,> didn't know
<,> what to say <,> how to say it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#243:1:A>
Uhm <,> they may use some kind of uhm simple words <,> and uh so I
think uh that  ' s that may be right <,> they have better <,> written English
<,> ability than the spoken one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#244:1:A>
I think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X245:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X246:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X247:1:Z>
Did they try <,> did they bring a dictionary along with them and
try to </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#248:1:A>
<&> laughs </&> No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X249:1:Z>
Try to point out the word they are trying to say </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#250:1:A>
No no no no

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#251:1:A>
But uh <,> uh actually we asked them to teach us some Japanese
words indeed

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#252:1:A>
Uhm <,> but I think yes they maybe have a <,> better written
English ability <{> <[> <,,> cos <[> they have more practice but uh for
spoken English I think uh <,> maybe <,> they need more practice or

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#253:1:A>
Because uhm <,> I think Hong Kong is <,> an international city you
see so we have to be <,> good in English <,> in order to communicate with <,>
other people or to compete in the society for jobs

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X254:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X255:1:Z>
Yeah <,> cos like <,> if you watch TV <{> <[> there </[> <,>
there is the uhm <,> English channel and the Chinese channel <,> so <,> like
<,> you you  ' re exposed to more uhm <,,> more <,> environment <,> to use <,>
to <.> lis </.> to even listen to <,> English </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#256:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#257:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X258:1:Z>
So <{> <[> <,,> That  ' s good I think </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#259:1:A>
<[> I think uh <,> English </[> </{> becomes a basic
requirement <,> of the employers

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#260:1:A>
If you don't know English <,> or you can't uhm <,> write English
or speak English well <,> then you are out of the game <,,> cos uh that  ' s
the basic the most basic <,> requirement <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#261:1:A>
You know <,> it is taken for granted that <,> you must know <,>
uhm <,> or you must write or speak English <,> uh <,> in a <,> very good
level or not very good but in a fair <,> level <,> uh before you can apply
for a job <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#262:1:A>
<{> <[> They are still <unc> one-word </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X263:1:Z>

<[> Did they test </[> </{> you when you apply for a job </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#265:1:A>
Well uhm <,> I <,> just uh <,> had <,,> an examination for

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X266:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X267:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#268:1:A>
Oh <,> it  ' s exhausting you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#269:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#270:1:A>
You <{> <[> can't stand it </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X271:1:Z>
<[> How many </[> </{> hours was it

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X272:1:Z>
How many hours </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#273:1:A>
Uhm <,> it starts at about <,> at <,> nine-thirty and it ends
at uhm <,> four-forty and <{> <[> in </[> between there  ' s an hour for lunch

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X274:1:Z>
<[> Wow </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X275:1:Z>
What about if you want to go to bathroom <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X276:1:Z>
You just go <,> you <,> you don't have to <,> say anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#277:1:A>
No <,> you can't go out there

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#278:1:A>
You <,> you can't go to the bathroom <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#279:1:A>
Uh <,> you can you have to go <,> to the bathroom uh beforehand

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X280:1:Z>
Beforehand </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#281:1:A>
Yap <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> before you <,> <{2> <[2> go into the
</[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X282:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X283:1:Z>
<[2> Start the </[2> </{2> exam </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#284:1:A>
Yeah <,> go into centre <,> to sit for the exam <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#285:1:A>
And the first part is the Use of English <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#286:1:A>
Well I think uh <,> it  ' s uh it  ' s <O> intelligible-sound </O> one
and a half hour <,,> but it <,> it  ' s not enough

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#287:1:A>
The time is not enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#288:1:A>
You know the passage is not <,> is not difficult but <,> it  ' s
rather <,,> it  ' s <,> indirect <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#289:1:A>
Its <,> meaning is not directly showing to you <,> <.> y </.> you
know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#290:1:A>
You have to think about it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#291:1:A>
And uh <,> the most difficult thing is that <,> uh <,> when you
write your answer <{> <[> <,> </[> you have to limit your words <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#292:1:A>
Uh because there  ' s a <,> bracket <,> uh writing uhm <,> maybe
twenty-five <,> in the bracket and <,> so your answer should be twenty-five
words or less than twenty-five words

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#293:1:A>
Otherwise <,> those uh more than twenty-five words <,> will not be
marked

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X294:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X295:1:Z>
Really <{> <[> what </[> kind of questions were they </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#296:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#297:1:A>
Uhm <,> about the comprehension <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#298:1:A>
Uh sort of uhm <{> <[> <,> an essay </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X299:1:Z>
<[> So you read </[> </{> a story and they <,> ask you questions
about the story </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#300:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#301:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#302:1:A>
And you have to find <,> some phrases similar to the meaning
or of some terms

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#303:1:A>
And then you have to fill in the blanks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#304:1:A>
And when <,,> this paper is over you have about ten minutes <,>
ten minutes  '  rest <,> and uhm <,> people will just go crazily to the
bathroom

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X305:1:Z>
Oh <,> is that like SAT

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X306:1:Z>
Is it similar to SAT exam </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#307:1:A>
Uhm <,,> sort of I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#308:1:A>
And then <,> after you after ten minutes  '  rest <,> you have to go
back again <,> and to take the <,> aptitude test

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#309:1:A>
The aptitude test is to test your logic <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#310:1:A>
And uh but I don't think it can test anybody  ' s logic because you
have to finish <,> about uhm <,,> sixty <,> sixty questions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#311:1:A>
Uh it divides into two parts <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#312:1:A>
The first part <,> have <,> about fifteen <,> questions <,> and
you have uh forty-five minutes for it <,> but don't be so happy because you  ' ll
never finish it within that forty-five minutes because <,> that fifteen
questions are very difficult <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#313:1:A>
And uh <,> you have to read a lot before you can answer <,> and
you have to think a lot before you can answer <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#314:1:A>
So uhm <,> maybe it requires you about <,,> uh <,> two minutes to
do <,,> one question but that  ' s not enough actually <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and
then after the forty-five minutes <,> you have to turn to Part B and you have
about <,,> I don't know how many <,> maybe twenty something <,> uh twenty
graphic <,,> and data questions <,> statistics <,> data <{3> <[3> <,,> graphs
</[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X315:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X316:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X317:1:Z>
<[3> So it  ' s like <,> mathematical </[3> </{3> <,> <{> <[>
questions </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#318:1:A>
<[> Yep </[> </{> not mathematical but uh <,> ya <,> but with
some kind of logic inside

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#319:1:A>
<{> <[> You </[> have to think about it <,> and uhm <,> actually
it  ' s not <,> it  ' s totally impossible for us to finish it within that <,>
time <,> that kind of time because uh that  ' s too difficult

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#320:1:A>
And uhm <,> except for those I think I <,> it may be good for
those science students <,> because uhm <,> they can think very fast and uhm
<,> they can <,> work out an answer very quickly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X321:1:Z>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X322:1:Z>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X323:1:Z>
They I think they are used to uhm <,> with problem-solving </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#324:1:A>
Yeah <,> <{> <[> which is </[> statistics <,> data

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X325:1:Z>
<[> Because </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X326:1:Z>
Yeah <,> they do a lot of math and uhm <,> physics and all that
stuff </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#327:1:A>
Yeah <,,> sort of uh calculation <,> and we are the Arts
students <&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#328:1:A>
Huh I think the last time that I did Mathematics is uhm <,> in my
Form Five <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#329:1:A>
You know <,> it  ' s about <,> five years ago <,> I forgot
everything <,> almost everything <,> and uh I don't think that even if I fail
in this logic <,> test <,> uhm it means that I  ' m illogical <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#330:1:A>
It doesn't mean that but uhm <,> I think it may be a fair game <,>
for the science students

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#331:1:A>
You know because uhm <,> they may <,> not be good in writing <,,>
in English so uhm <,> in order to be fair <,,> to these <,> science students
they have to <,> make out <.> s </.> such kind of uh logic test <{> <[> <,>
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#332:1:A>
So <,> uh even they <,> didn't <,> do well in the <,> writing test
<,> they can do well in the mathematics and the logic test <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#333:1:A>
And uh so <,> a kind of fair because uh <,> if everything is uhm
<,,> only good for the <,> Arts students <,> writing <,> uh <,> composition
<,> essays <,> comprehension sort of uh <,> writing things <,> uh then it may
be <,> it may become unfair to the science students because they <,> seldom
write <,> essays <,> writings <,> or uhm <,> they will not do <,> sort of a
comprehension but we did a lot of comprehension in our <,> courses

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#334:1:A>
You <.> s </.> you know <,> Arts students have to read a lot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X335:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X336:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-006#337:1:A>
You know <,> so that  ' s why it  ' s a fair game

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#338:1:A>
And the last part is uhm <,> two questions one in Chinese and one
in English you have to answer both <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#339:1:A>
And uh <,> it  ' s about sort of uh situation questions <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#340:1:A>
You have to <,> maybe write a letter for <,> for some uh <,> chief
commissioner <,> something like that <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> solve the problems

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#341:1:A>
Uh they are not <,> real problem but <,> they are realistic
problem <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#342:1:A>
Yeah <,> it may happen in <,> when you work in a government <,>
and uh <,> that  ' s why they have to test about your analytical <,> uhm <,>
your ability to analyze things you know <,> and to work out a solution a very
quick solution for the problem and you have to write it out <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#343:1:A>
And I think <,> that part is maybe maybe good for some Social
Science students <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> because they have to do a lot of uh
problem-solving <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#344:1:A>
So <,> uh <,> nobody is the most <,> uhm <,> advantageous <,> <{3>
<[3> in <,> </[3> in the game

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X345:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X346:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-006#X347:1:Z>
<[3> Oh wow </[3> </{3> </I>
