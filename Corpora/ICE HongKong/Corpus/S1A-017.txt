<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X74:1:Z>
But <,> I always keep in touch with them through <,> email <{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#81:1:B>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X82:1:Z>
Yeah my father is a dentist and my mother does not work <,> so <,>
I think they must be feeling very lonely because <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> all
three children are away from home <{2> <[2> and </[2> just the both of them
in Sri Lanka so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#83:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#84:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> <{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#85:1:A>
Then why why don't you go to uh America also

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X86:1:Z>
Well uh <,> in America they say that uh because I  ' m studying
dentistry <{> <[> <,> </[> they say it takes about <,> six seven eight years
to do dentistry because </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#87:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#88:1:B>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X89:1:Z>
Seven nine <{1> <[1> years </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X90:1:Z>
Yeah because <,> uh you had to do something called pre-med <,>
which is <,> something like A-Levels I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X91:1:Z>
So you have to do pre-med before you <,> start doing dentistry
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X92:1:Z>
So <,> <?> I  ' m not </?> wasting seven or eight years <?> for </?>
a girl <&> all laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#93:1:A>
<[1> So long </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#94:1:A>
<[2> Uhm Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#95:1:A>
Especially for a girl

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X96:1:Z>
Yeah oh yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X97:1:Z>
I  ' m not too keen so I <{1> <[1> just </[1> wanted to <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> to go to a place where they have a <unc> one-word </unc>
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#98:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#99:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#100:1:A>
But why do you choose Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X101:1:Z>
Well in Sri Lanka we have only one <,> dental school <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> and for A-Levels you have to get very good results like four As or
three As or something <{2> <[2> like </[2> that to get you in

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X102:1:Z>
And it  ' s very competitive and I could not get those results <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3> so I applied to Hong Kong and to some other countries <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X103:1:Z>
Hong Kong is very close to Sri Lanka <{4> <[4> <,> so </[4> my
parents especially my mom <,> being very strict she just wanted me to go to a
place where which is close to Sri Lanka <{5> <[5> so that </[5> whenever I
want I can go home <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X104:1:Z>
So <,> that  ' s why I chose <,> Hong Kong <&> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#105:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#106:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#107:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#108:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#109:1:A>
<[5> <unc> two words </unc> </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#110:1:A>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#111:1:B>
Why do you so strongly <,> attracted to dentistry

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X112:1:Z>
Well <,> from my smaller days I  ' ve seen my father as a dentist
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X113:1:Z>
And <,> I think for a girl <,> <{2> <[2> more </[2> than medicine
that this is my personal view more than medicine I think for a girl dentistry
is <,> something uhm <,> easy to <,> study and <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X114:1:Z>
It doesn't take a lot of time <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X115:1:Z>
If you just work during the day then <{4> <[4> in </[4> the
evening you have like you can you know go to a family do something et cetera

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X116:1:Z>
But if you become a doctor then if there  ' s some <{5> <[5>
emergency </[5> then even in the night you have to go out <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>
so <,> that  ' s why I just <,> want to be <&> laughs </&> wanted to be a
dentist from my smaller days <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X117:1:Z>

I have a clinicals <,> and I have to deal with patients how to be

are dealing with another human being so you have to be very careful about
<{3> <[3> what </[3> you do

<[> I </[> </{> will work hard

Which area do you want to focus

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#192:1:B>
Uh perhaps uhm feminism or sexuality

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X193:1:Z>
Really <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X194:1:Z>
That  ' s a very nice topic very interesting topic <{> <[> I should

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#195:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#196:1:B>
Yes <&> laughs </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X197:1:Z>
Why you know why <{> <[> <unc> multiple words </unc> </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#198:1:A>
<[> Why do you have so much </[> interest in sexuality

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#199:1:B>
<[> <&> laughs </&> </[> </{> uh uhm because uhm this year I
have taken a course on feminism and uh this course also have a great focus on
sexuality of woman

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#200:1:B>
Uh I find it very interesting and <,> and I  ' m <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#201:1:B>
I I think I <,> hope that I can <,> uh do more research on this
field and <,> try to <,> perhaps <,> I can say save woman <&> laughs </&> of
the world <&> laughs </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#202:1:A>
I have that dream when I was in year one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X203:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#204:1:B>
<&> laughs </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#205:1:A>
I I I take Comparative Literature also <{> <[> <,> </[> but
after <,> a few months I forgot all about that <&> all laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#206:1:A>
Then why do you take English also

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#207:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#208:1:B>
Uhm because uhm I want to be a teacher too

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#209:1:B>
So uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#210:1:A>
If you can't be a professor

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#211:1:B>
Yeah <&> all laugh </&> I can be a teacher of English in
secondary school

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#212:1:B>
So I think uhm double majors is my <,> uhm is the best way <,> for
me to <,> do in the university

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#213:1:B>
Just uhm <,> perhaps <,> it <,> can be uhm <,> a means of security
as well because uhm if I can get a good hon <,> uh at my graduation I can uh
have my postgraduate study in Comparative Literature

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#214:1:B>
But <,> uh <{> <[> <,> uh </[> unfortunately if I can't get a good
hon then I can go to a secondary school and <,> teach English in <,> that way

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#215:1:B>
Uhm so I think uhm <,> secure

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#216:1:A>
<[> I  ' m sure you can </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#217:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X218:1:Z>
Okay so Iris what about your studies </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#219:1:A>
Well my <.> ma </.> major is English and my minor is French

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#220:1:A>
And <,> I haven't learned French before and <,> I  ' ve started in
the university in year one and it  ' s very hard <{> <[> and </[> <,> it takes
me a lot of time to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X221:1:Z>
<[> Really </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X222:1:Z>
So can you just tell us something in French </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#223:1:A>
Uh <,,> no <&> all-laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#224:1:A>
Well I don't speak very well <{1> <[1> French </[1> and <,> uhm
<,> these three years I  ' ve spent a lot of time uh on on doing the grammar
and <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and all <,> all of the sentence structure and <,> and
that

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#225:1:A>
And I  ' m doing a project in French detective story now

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X226:1:Z>
<[1> Alright </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#227:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X228:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#229:1:A>
Yeah and <,> takes me a lot of time to read something <?>
read </?> book in French you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#230:1:A>
I can't understand what what is that <,> all about

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#231:1:A>
And I just sometimes guess what is it

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#232:1:A>
Uh it takes me three hours to reach to read just a few pages <,>
only

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X233:1:Z>
Wow </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#234:1:A>
<&> laughs </&> because <,> it  ' s very difficult to read in
another language uh uh other than Chinese and English I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X235:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X236:1:Z>
But why did you want to study French </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#237:1:A>
I don't know why but ever since I was a young girl <,> maybe
I think nine year old <,> I I just have <,> an interest in <.> f </.> French
culture and <,> all the French style uh food or drinks or <{> <[> a lot </[>
of the <?> clothes </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X238:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X239:1:Z>
Have you been to France </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#240:1:A>
No well I had a chance to go to <.> Fran </.> France last
year but uhm because I want to stay in Hong Kong and do other things so I <,>
I <.> ju </.> just I didn't go <,> but maybe this year but not probably I
won't go this year also

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X241:1:Z>
Why </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#242:1:A>
I have not enough money <&> all-laugh </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X243:1:Z>
But <,> uh you will be graduating this a last year right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#244:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X245:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X246:1:Z>
Well after that you know after you get a job I  ' m sure you will
be able to <,> go sometime with your <,,> special friend <&> all laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X247:1:Z>
So tell us tell us about your special friend </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#248:1:B>
Yes <{> <[> <&>

$B and

$Z laugh </&> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#249:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X250:1:Z>
<&>

$B and

$Z laugh </&> Okay </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#251:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#252:1:A>
Taking French is very good because uhm in the examination <,>
you know before the examination you have to study and prepare a lot for other
subjects but you just don't have to prepare <,> for French

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X253:1:Z>
Why is that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#254:1:A>
Because <,> you can take a dictionary <,> and you can

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X255:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#256:1:A>
And in the examination hall you just <,> you  ' re just uh <,>
uhm how to say <?> com </?> competing your <,> your speed of reading the
dictionary because <,> uh you <{> <[> can bring </[> dictionary and in the
oral part part you don't have to prepare and in the listening part you don't
have to prepare and just some sentence and grammar and <,> in the hall you
can <,> look at the dictionary

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X257:1:Z>
<[> Wow wow </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X258:1:Z>
Wow <{> <[> I think </[> I should have taken French <&> all laugh
</&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#259:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#260:1:B>
Yeah me too <&> laughs <&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X261:1:Z>
That  ' s very easy </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#262:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#263:1:A>
So so uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#264:1:A>
Well in day time in <,> the normal time you have to study a lot
you know to pay a lot of attention and <,> pay a lot of time to study it but
in the examination you don't have to prepare much <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#265:1:A>
So that  ' s <,> the </[> best part of taking French

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X266:1:Z>
<[> <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X267:1:Z>
<?> That  ' s very good </?> </{> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X268:1:Z>
Yeah so it  ' s <,> like how many subjects are you doing French
English </X>

<$A> Uhm I take uhm <,> totally <.> s </.> six courses <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
this year and <,> two whole courses in French and other four <.> ha </.> and
other courses on English <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#269:1:A>
And English you have to prepare <,> but I don't think <,> it is
<{3> <[3> not </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X270:1:Z>
<[1> Oh yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X271:1:Z>
<[2> Oh yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#X272:1:Z>
<[3> English </[3> </{3> is easy </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#273:1:A>
Not that harsh as <,> yours <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#274:1:A>
Quite easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#275:1:A>
You you just have to study

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#276:1:A>
Because I  ' m <,> taking linguistics

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#277:1:A>
Most of them are linguistics

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#278:1:A>
You just <,> have to memorize them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#279:1:A>
It  ' s your memory that <,> you have to <,> work <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-017#280:1:B>
Okay then

<ICE-HK:S1A-017#281:1:B>
Tell us about your <.> se </.> special friend <&> all laugh </&>
