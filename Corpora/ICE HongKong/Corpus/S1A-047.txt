<ICE-HK:S1A-047#1:1:A>
Look at the dog

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#4:1:A>
I mean it  ' s black and he  ' s white

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#5:1:A>
You think he can see color

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#6:1:A>
You think he knows that this is a different color from himself

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X7:1:Z>
I don't think he can see color

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X8:1:Z>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X9:1:Z>
He should be used to technology </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#10:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#11:1:A>
Why should he used to technology

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X12:1:Z>
Well look around you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#13:1:A>
Yeah but he doesn't know it  ' s technology does he

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X14:1:Z>
<&> laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#15:1:A>
I mean I mean he  ' s really <.> sh </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#16:1:A>
He is really shrinking away from it

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#17:1:A>
I mean he  ' s <.> ri </.> he  ' s <.> ri </.> retreated to the other
end of the table <,> keeping a safe distance from this thing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X18:1:Z>
It  ' s just bored <{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> sleep
<unc> three-words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#19:1:A>
<[> I don't think so </[> </{> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#20:1:A>
You think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X21:1:Z>
Yep </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#22:1:A>
Well <,> I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#23:1:A>
It  ' s not really

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#24:1:A>
It  ' s not really it  ' s bedtime yet

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#25:1:A>
And this is the time when he <,> becomes very active <,> when he
sort of gets up and said look you  ' ve had your supper

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#26:1:A>
You  ' ve sat down for long enough

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#27:1:A>
You  ' ve ignored me for long enough <,> and I  ' ve been very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#28:1:A>
I haven't hassled you

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#29:1:A>
You know it  ' s time we played duck

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X30:1:Z>
This is not the picture of an active dog <,> with its chin on the
table <,> his eyelids drooping </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#31:1:A>
I think it  ' s to do with the fact that he  ' s terrified of this
machine that  ' s whirring away in front of him

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X32:1:Z>
He  ' s getting up to investigate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#33:1:A>
<&> laugh </&> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#34:1:A>
Look I  ' m I  ' m almost finished Sacred Hunger <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#35:1:A>
I  ' m onto page two hundred and fifty <,> and I  ' ve got how many
more pages

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#36:1:A>
Uhm <,> last page is six hundred and thirty ok so six thirty minus
three fifty

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#37:1:A>
How how much is that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X38:1:Z>
Three three </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#39:1:A>
Uh two eighty

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X40:1:Z>
Well I was reading that book

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X41:1:Z>
When was I reading that book </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#42:1:A>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X43:1:Z>
A year ago </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#44:1:A>
Well I started reading it when I when we went on to Yangtze
River

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X45:1:Z>
<?> And then you stopped </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#46:1:A>
Yeah well the print is too small

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#47:1:A>
<.> Th </.> this this new one which is I think <,> uhm thicker by
about one third <,> I bought in England

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#48:1:A>
And this one  ' s got larger print <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#49:1:A>
This has got larger print <,> and this one is about what <,,> two
thirds as thick as uh Hitler and Stalin

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X50:1:Z>
Yeah <&> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X51:1:Z>
That  ' s next on your list right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#52:1:A>
Yep

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#53:1:A>
Hitler and Stalin

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#54:1:A>
I I think Hitler and Stalin I  ' m gonna sort of read it <,> uhm in
read it while reading other things

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#55:1:A>
And when I want a bit of you know excitement then I  ' ll read Hitler
and Stalin <&> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#56:1:A>
<.> Re </.> rest of the time I  ' ll read Upamanyu Chatterjee and you
know <,> folk like that <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X57:1:Z>
The other thing I remember about the Sacred Hunger apart from the
fact that I really liked it is the very beginning <,> which is about the <?>
paradise nigger </?> who turns up in <,> either New Orleans or St Louis or
somewhere </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#58:1:A>
Oh yes yes yes yes yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X59:1:Z>
And then the mutiny bit in the middle somewhere </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#60:1:A>
Well I haven't got to the mutiny bit

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X61:1:Z>
Oh I  ' d better not tell you then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#62:1:A>
No because I I

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#63:1:A>
Look I  ' ve passed gone past the middle

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#64:1:A>
The mutiny bit is obviously not in the middle <&> laugh </&> I but
I think it  ' s coming <,> like the weather is coming

<$Z> <X> <&> laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#65:1:A>
Yeah it  ' s coming <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#66:1:A>
It  ' s really jolly good I must say

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#67:1:A>
It  ' s very impressive <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#68:1:A>
Very impressive indeed <&> pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X69:1:Z>
Well I think I  ' m gonna finish Singapore Grip before you finish
that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#70:1:A>
Do you think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X71:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#72:1:A>
What  ' s it about

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X73:1:Z>
It  ' s about Singapore in the nineteen <,> forties

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X74:1:Z>
Uhm and it  ' s just <unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#75:1:A>
The Japs were there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X76:1:Z>
The Japanese have just invaded Malaya and they  ' re coming steaming
down the peninsula

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X77:1:Z>
And there are a few chapters they  ' re going to come to Singapore
<,> and that  ' s gonna be the end of the line <?> for most of them </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X78:1:Z>
It  ' s very it  ' s fun it  ' s funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X79:1:Z>
It  ' s rather like that the first one uhm the Irish one whose name
I  ' ve forgotten <&>

$A laughed </&> <.> s </.> story I  ' ve also forgotten <,,> about a hotel in
Ireland

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X80:1:Z>
Anyway the main character in that first in the Irish one turns up
again here sort of twenty years older in the Singapore Grip but it  ' s very
peculiar because the middle one in the trilogy is set in the <?> Indian </?>
mutiny back in <,> eighteen fifty seven or nine or whenever it was <,> so it
goes in a funny direction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X81:1:Z>
Chris <O> name </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X82:1:Z>
He he died shortly after <,> writing this book

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X83:1:Z>
He died in an accident

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X84:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X85:1:Z>
He went on a fishing expedition in in Ireland somewhere so he
wasn't all that old </X>

Nineteen seventy-nine

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X96:1:Z>
Yep </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#97:1:A>
That  ' s quite young then <{> <[> <,> </[> when he died

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X98:1:Z>
<[> Yep </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X99:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X101:1:Z>
First one is called Troubles </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#102:1:A>
Right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X103:1:Z>
The middle one is The Seige of Krishnapur

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X104:1:Z>
That  ' s the one that got the Booker Prize in seventy-three </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#105:1:A>
Right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X106:1:Z>
And this one <,> seventy-eight <,> the year before he died </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#107:1:A>
Booker Prize has been on the go for a very long time <?>
hasn't it </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#108:1:A>
Did you see that article on Singapore on the in the in the Eastern
Express today <,> about <{> <[> how it was turning itself into </[> into an a
real hub of technology

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#109:1:A>
I think that  ' s what the conference is about yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#110:1:A>
The conference on the unwritten <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#111:1:A>
Because I mean the whole stuff of it if you get the article in in
the Eastern Express which is <,> it  ' s actually <?> got </?> from the
Guardian actually begins by saying that <,> all this stuff in the
informations <{> <[> is about <unc> three words </unc> is that </[>
you turn you turn the words into into machine code uh it travels down <,>
some kind of you know uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X112:1:Z>
<[> I read about I read about half of it </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X113:1:Z>
<unc> five words </unc> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X114:1:Z>
Digital <{> <[> fibre optic </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#115:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#116:1:A>
And uhm I think that  ' s what the unwritten is about all about

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X117:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#118:1:A>
I  ' ve been trying to interest my friends into going <,> to
this conference

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#119:1:A>
Nobody <&> laugh </&> has shown slightest interest in it so far

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X120:1:Z>
Well <?> I will go to this conference </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X121:1:Z>
The only drawback that would prevent me from going to this
conference is that you  ' re going to go

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X122:1:A>
Well I don't think we we should <{> <[> go to the same
conference </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X123:1:Z>
<[> No I don't want </[> </{> any more conferences <unc> four
words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#124:1:A>
Yeah I mean I think it  ' s boring

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X125:1:Z>
Thanks honey <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X126:1:Z>
Anyway I thought the the unwritten was all about things like <,>
performance </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#127:1:A>
Ah that  ' s what you think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X128:1:Z>
And and then <{> <[> <unc> three words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#129:1:A>
<[> It  ' s old rather old-fashioned </[> </{> view of the
unwritten

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X130:1:Z>
<unc> multiple words </unc> problems there

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X131:1:Z>
I mean you think it  ' s all about the information superhighway
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#132:1:A>
Well why not <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#133:1:A>
It  ' s unwritten right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X134:1:Z>
Well <{> <[> <unc> four words </unc> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X135:1:Z>
It must be written to be on the information <,> <{> <[>
superhighway </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#136:1:A>
<[> <unc> three words </unc> </[> </{> <[> It depends
on </[> </{> what you mean by but then yeah the the thing is that these words
get translated into machine code <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#137:1:A>
Is the is machine code written

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X138:1:Z>
Well it must be I mean <&> dog barking </&> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X139:1:Z>
Anyway so tell me about the conference today </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#140:1:A>
Well I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#141:1:A>
I mean it  ' s <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#142:1:A>
Well <,> the first session it was it was supposed to be two people
there

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#143:1:A>
A <.> wo </.> this one woman from the Philippines uhm who was
supposed to talk about <,> writing by American Jews <,> and Filipino Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X144:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X145:1:Z>
She she  ' s a writer </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#146:1:A>
No no no no she  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#147:1:A>
I don't know what she is but she  ' s affiliated to some school

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#148:1:A>
I think she  ' s <,> she  ' s a high school teacher but the blurb she
sent to the conference was extremely brief very vague <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#149:1:A>
Uhm and and oh and the only thing <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#150:1:A>
The the the only thing I could make out from it was that she  ' s
going to talk about American Jews and Filipino Chinese and <,> and about the
literature they produce

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X151:1:Z>
Uhm sounds quite interesting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#152:1:A>
Yeah but I mean you know I mean that  ' s a rather vast leap
across time and space <,> without any indication I mean real indication I
think as uh you know about what she was going to say apart apart from saying
things like you know <,> representing themselves but then you know so what
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#153:1:A>
So anyway but anyway she she didn't turn up

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#154:1:A>
I think <,> she probably couldn't get funding to come or <,>
something like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#155:1:A>
Uhm and then there was this guy from uhm from Melbourne and <,> he
was quite good

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#156:1:A>
He was quite good

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#157:1:A>
And he  ' s he  ' s really a historian and he seems he knows Norman
Owen apparently

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X158:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#159:1:A>
Or at least they introduced themselves to each other

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#160:1:A>
Norman was <,> I gather policing the precinct <,> with all these
guys wearing red badges <?> as a sort of </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X161:1:Z>
He  ' s he  ' s chairing various things <unc> one-word </unc>
he </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#162:1:A>
Well yes he  ' s also part of the one of the conference
organizers <{> <[> so </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#163:1:A>
There there are yellow badges red badges and white badges

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#164:1:A>
Red badges were people like Elizabeth and Norman you know people
actually sort of getting their you know sort of getting their hands dirty
doing things

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X165:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X166:1:Z>
Yep </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#167:1:A>
Uhm <,> yellow badges are for some some kind of the general
crowd and white badges are for people like myself <,> chairing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X168:1:Z>
<?> Who are </?> the people like yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#169:1:A>
Chairing sessions <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#170:1:A>
I don't know what you get if both chair sessions and give papers

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#171:1:A>
That is not known to me <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#172:1:A>
But anyway this guy came and he he <.> wha </.> well he thought
<,> he he he gave his paper on what he called uhm Sino what he called the
Sino-Malay paradigm in modern Indonesian literature

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#173:1:A>
He said the <,> official view of Indonesian literature <,> uhm a
modern Indonesian literature is that it started in nineteen twenties <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#174:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#175:1:A>
Began in nineteen twenties a modern Indonesian literature began in
nineteen twenties etcetera

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#176:1:A>
<{2> <[2> Now </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X177:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> <[2> Is it </[2> </{2> when people started
writing in something that wasn't Dutch </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#178:1:A>
Well I suppose so

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#179:1:A>
I suppose that  ' s what it meant but but the interesting thing <,>
that this guy was saying was that there  ' s actually a huge body of writing
<,> what he called Sino-Malay writing and I picked him up on that uhm at
question time because I wasn't sure what he meant by that

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#180:1:A>
He kept calling it the Sino-Malay paradigm and then <,> at various
<?> sort of </?> moments in the paper he <,> referred to Chinese Malay
literature <,> so I wasn't sure what <mention> Sino-Malay </mention> the term
that he actually used uh meant

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#181:1:A>
Does it mean uhm people of Chinese ethnicity or ancestry writing
in Malay <,> or Low Malay he calls it <{> <[> uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X182:1:Z>
<[> What is it </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#183:1:A>
Low Malay

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#184:1:A>
I  ' ll I  ' ll I  ' ll I  ' ll tell you what  ' s the difference between
Low and High in a minute but Low Malay or is Sino-Malay a hyphenated term uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#185:1:A>
Does it refer to a hybrid language a creolized language or or or
or you know things like that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#186:1:A>
And uhm <,> it wasn't clear from his paper what he was talking
about

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#187:1:A>
Really whether he was so I I actually took him up on that <,> and
he got rather <,> anxious <,> for some reason and kept saying oh yes yes I uh
wrote this paper very quickly and and very hurriedly and I didn't have time
to clarify my terms very sorry there  ' s this confusion

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#188:1:A>
I mean he was extremely apologetic

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#189:1:A>
<{> <[> I mean I wasn't </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X190:1:Z>
<[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </{> never thought about
it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#191:1:A>
Well I think he didn't but I thought that was actually basic
<,> uhm to a paper that is about linguistic and cultural politics uhm and <,>
he sees it

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#192:1:A>
Well because it  ' s just that  ' s what the paper is about

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#193:1:A>
He said well the traditional view of Malay of of sorry of
Indonesian uh national literature actually excludes this Sino-Malay stuff
saying either that it  ' s <,> it  ' s uhm a a separate autonomous development
<,> right

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#194:1:A>
Or saying that it  ' s uhm exclusively Chinese <,> ok

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#195:1:A>
So it  ' s got nothing to do with names <{> <[> you know </[> what
natives and other people <,> presumably uhm or saying that it  ' s uh in Low
Malay and therefore not really <,> kind of not really acceptable

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#196:1:A>
Now <.> l </.> Low Malay uh seems really the Malay of the market
place as opposed to high Malay which is educated Malay

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#197:1:A>
And the established view the official view of Indonesian
literature seems to suggest that before independence most literature was
written in High Malay and that is <,> the the tradition as it were <,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X198:1:Z>
<[> Uhm yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X199:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#200:1:A>
But this guy was saying in fact the archive this he  ' s <.> s
</.> said that there  ' s a lot of archival material

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#201:1:A>
There  ' s about three thousand items at least he said <,> of stuff
which is produced in the Sino-Malay uhm <,,> language or well we call it you
know the Sino-Malay literature

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#202:1:A>
Uhm and he said it it wasn't <,> exclusively Chinese people who
were the people of Chinese ancestors who  ' s using this language but then
everybody was <,> uh who could use it used it

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#203:1:A>
And it wasn't exclusively on uhm <,> uhm and it wasn't such and
because of that therefore it wasn't sort of separate

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#204:1:A>
It wasn't autonomous on on on an autonomous <,> tradition

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#205:1:A>
It should be <.> con </.> considered he said as a kind of moment
in the development of modern Indonesian literature

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X206:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#207:1:A>
Now of course he said and then he went on said that of course
the political reasons as to why people take this view <{> <[> <,> </[>
especially after independence when all this High and Low Malay stuff was
replaced by Bahasa Indonesia <,> standard <,> Indonesian language and and you
know the uh and people just just <,> have to write in that language <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#208:1:A>
So I asked him I said you know look I mean I wasn't try to pick
holes in your arguments

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#209:1:A>
Simple thing is that I want to know because is it a language uh
Sino-Malay a language like the Barbar language <,> which is a hybridized
language which is as English as its uhm main kind of <,> uhm stand as it were

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#210:1:A>
Uhm and then has you know Malay words has sort of Hokkian
Anglicized Hokkian kind of words and things like that and I said the Barbar
language is dying out

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#211:1:A>
Uh will the Barbar community be dispersed

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X212:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X213:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#214:1:A>
And I said oh no no no no

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#215:1:A>
He said that well it  ' s not as clear-cut as that <unc>
two-words </unc> and in Indonesia because he said I said is is low Malay
use there still

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#216:1:A>
He said the older generation still uses it <,> and he said that
people who speak Bahasa Indonesia or people who use high Malay or use or know
high Malay actually recognizes the language <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#217:1:A>
You see so it is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X218:1:Z>
<unc> one word </unc> people can understand that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#219:1:A>
Yeah can understand that <{> <[> although </[> he said he
gave the examples of the different grammatical forms <,> but it  ' s a
recognizable it  ' s it  ' s a recognizable <,> language

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X220:1:Z>
<[> <unc> two words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X221:1:Z>
Was this guy Chinese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#222:1:A>
No no no no no no no

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#223:1:A>
Well his name is Koppel K O P P uh C O P P no K O P P E L <.> ss
</.> Australian so I assume Australian German <,> descent

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#224:1:A>
And uh well he  ' s a historian and he  ' s accumulated a huge amount
of material

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#225:1:A>
But it  ' s general he  ' s generally interested in Indonesia so he
speaks Indonesian <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#226:1:A>
And uh I suppose Bahasa Indonesian <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#227:1:A>
But anyway so it was it was actually quite interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#228:1:A>
Uhm I think he knows a bit about the <,> kind of you know current
theoretical literary cultural theory uhm on this sort of thing <,> on
identity

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X229:1:Z>
Where  ' s where  ' s he from </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#230:1:A>
Uhm Melbourne

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X231:1:Z>
University </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#232:1:A>
Yeah Melbourne Melbourne University

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#233:1:A>
And uhm so he was saying things oh you know whether you call the
uh established view the official view as the master narrative or hegemonic
discourse

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X234:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#235:1:A>
And other things

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#236:1:A>
You know but but taking a sort of rather sort of <,> sort of <,>
<?> slightly </?> cynical view of terms like that but basically it  ' s it is
that kind of theoretical framework that he is operating <,> in

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X237:1:Z>
Yep </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#238:1:A>
And the idea of you know reinstating this uh Sino-Malay uhm
literature in tradition

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#239:1:A>
Or perhaps inflecting I would say the official paradigm with this
you know Sino-Malay <,> what he called Sino-Malay paradigm but it  ' s actually
he  ' s trying to inflect <,> the official paradigm with it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#240:1:A>
So that was quite interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#241:1:A>
The afternoon session was were just three readings one by this <,>
woman uhm who was I think a Malaysian Malaysian Chinese woman who is now
actually <?> Monash </?> <,> uh whom I told you about earlier on and was
extraordinarily

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#242:1:A>
I mean she read her stuff

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#243:1:A>
It wasn't awful but you know <,> she read it in this

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X244:1:Z>
This is the psychiatrist </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#245:1:A>
Yeah she read it in this kind of <,> you know old dramatic
way which or what she called grammatic way

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X246:1:Z>
Doing different doing the voices </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-047#247:1:A>
Well no but gesturing and and <{> <[> and </[> and and kind
of pacing

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#248:1:A>
I think basically <?> to </?> make up for the lack of interest in
the content

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-047#X249:1:Z>
<[> Really </[> </{> </X> </I>
