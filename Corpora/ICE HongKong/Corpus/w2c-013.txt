<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#3:1>
POLICE want the Standard Chartered Bank to abandon its &ldquo;
customer-friendly &rdquo; open design , following five robberies at its
branches in the past two days . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#4:1>
In 37 of the 45 bank raids this year &dash; an alarming 82.2 per
cent &dash; robbers have targeted Standard Chartered .

<ICE-HK:W2C-013#5:1>
Last year , it accounted for 23 of the 94 hold-ups . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#6:1>
A police source said the Crime Prevention Bureau was now seeking a
meeting with bank management . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#7:1>
&ldquo; We are still trying to organise to meet top management ,
other than security people , next week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#8:1>
&ldquo; We  ' ll tell the bank it needs to examine questions of
staff turnover and possible loss of customers as a result of publicity about
the spate of robberies, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#9:1>
The bank employs 1,000 tellers in its 118 branches throughout
Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#10:1>
It loses , on average , about &dollar;20,000 each time it is held
up by robbers brandishing a pistol or claiming to have a gun or bomb . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#11:1>
Police said Chartered Standard was the principal advocate among
the territory  ' s 80 retail banks of the open plan or split-screen design .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#12:1>
&ldquo; In the split-screen design you leave a gap and there  ' s
no protection , although it can prevent someone from jumping over the
counter, &rdquo; the source said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#13:1>
Crime Prevention Bureau officers have been suggesting
modifications to the layout to make the bank less attractive to robbers .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#14:1>
&ldquo; The bank has put in new measures such as security cameras
and re-training of staff on procedural matters to reduce losses, &rdquo; the
source said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#15:1>
&ldquo; But these are measures which are taken after a robbery .

<ICE-HK:W2C-013#16:1>
What we want to see are steps to deter potential criminals from
coming in and to make it unattractive to them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#17:1>
&ldquo; While the bank says it wants to strike a balance between
customer friendliness and security , I think they  ' ve got a wrong balance .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#18:1>
&ldquo; They are saying the raids are not high-value and
dangerous robberies .

<ICE-HK:W2C-013#19:1>
But what happens if a policeman walks into a bank while the raid is
taking place . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#20:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s a matter of time before something serious happens ,
if security isn't further improved. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#21:1>
Police said the Association of Banks had been supportive in crime
prevention messages by circulating police reminders to member banks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#22:1>
The group had intensified the ongoing training programme for bank
staff on procedural measures to reduce loss . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#23:1>
&ldquo; The association is trying to make every bank aware it
&obrack; security &cbrack; is a key issue, &rdquo; the source said , adding
that the group met last month after four bank raids in one day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#24:1>
The public relations manager of Standard Chartered Bank , Miss
Grace Yu Mei-kuen , did not believe the spate of robberies would drain staff .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#25:1>
&ldquo; Robbery has not been the reason for staff departure . I  ' m
not aware this is one of the causes for staff turnover . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#26:1>
&ldquo; Our personnel department has done exit interviews on
those leaving the bank and this has not come up . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#27:1>
&ldquo; There are two main reasons for staff departure which are
either because they want to further their education or to switch to other
fields . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#28:1>
&ldquo; Many of the young staff members who are Form Seven
graduates came to work without deciding whether they wanted a career in
banking, &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#29:1>
Miss Yu said they would look into security at banks in
conjunction with police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#30:1>
However , she maintained they had to strike a balance between
customer friendliness and security . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#31:1>
She declined to elaborate on how the bank would improve security
or what was the staff turnover rate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#32:1>
Miss Yu said she did not know how many times the bank offices had
been robbed , but claimed management was concerned about the safety of staff
members and customers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#33:1>
&ldquo; I can't say how we instruct staff to deal with bank
robbery for security reasons , but we have taken steps to allay their fears
in the light of the raids, &rdquo; she added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#34:1>
The first of two raids yesterday happened at about 10.45 am at
the Un Chau Street branch in Shamshuipo when a man approached counter five
and produced a silver pistol . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#35:1>
He handed a slip to a 19-year-old teller who gave him
&dollar;13,000 .

<ICE-HK:W2C-013#36:1>
She activated the alarm after the man left carrying a pink plastic
bag . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#37:1>
Just before 2.30 pm , the branch at 287-299 Queen  ' s Road Central
was held up by a man claiming to have a gun . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#38:1>
He also approached counter five and passed the teller a slip of
paper claiming he had a gun and he wanted big denomination notes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#39:1>
He was given &dollar;40,000 all in &dollar;1,000 notes and he
fled on foot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#40:1>
Police were last night still searching for the robbers . </p>

road because the green light for pedestrians was flashing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#60:2>
&ldquo; All the cars had stopped to allow us to cross but all of
a sudden a goods vehicle on the fast lane surged forward and hit us . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#61:2>

behind by a container truck which could not brake in front of the traffic
lights in time, &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#62:2>

anti-theft device on the two cash boxes containing the money had exploded ,
emitting clouds of orange dye , shortly after the robbery . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#82:3>
&ldquo; We believe the clothes of the two gunmen have been dyed
with the security dust . Therefore we are appealing for information on the
suspects answering the description , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#83:3>
Police said three Guardforce staff members were collecting
&dollar;1.5 million in cash takings from Jusco after the two-day Christmas

them from the rubbish collection point and demanded the cash . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#85:3>

captain armed with a shotgun put up a struggle . </p>

<p>

robbers were hurt in the shootout although we have found some bloodstains
here , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#90:3>
Before jumping into a grey getaway goods van with the third man
at the wheel , the robbers graded the cash as well as the security guard , Mr
Ho Kwok-keung , who was carrying the cash boxes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#91:3>
Chief Inspector Wong said Mr Ho had his head covered by clothes
while sitting in the back seat of the van which was believed to have traveled
to North Point via the Island Eastern Corridor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#92:3>

abandoned van on the first floor with Mr Ho on board .

LEGISLATORS have accepted complaints by cinema operators about
increased penalties for allowing underaged patrons to see Category III films .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#101:4>
The Council Bills Committee agreed yesterday that the maximum
penalty for first and second convictions should remain at &dollar;10,000 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#102:4>
The proposed amended Film Censorship Ordinance would have
increased the maximum penalties to &dollar;50,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#103:4>
Legislator Man Sai-cheong said he and his colleagues recognised
that it was hard to stop youngsters seeing Category III films . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#104:4>
&ldquo; We agreed that it is sometimes quite difficult to
prevent &obrack; underaged &cbrack; people from entering the cinemas ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#105:4>
A proposal to increase maximum penalties in line with inflation
was rejected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#106:4>
It was felt that deterrent measures did not need to keep pace
with inflation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-013#107:4>
&ldquo; A raise just because of inflation is not very convincing
, &rdquo; Man said . </p>

Cinema proprietors had complained of double standards where
publicly exhibited films were regulated but videotapes and laser discs were
