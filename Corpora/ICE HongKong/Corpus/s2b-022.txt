<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-022#1:1:A>
As we enter into the final phase of transition <,> Hong Kong
people  ' s confidence over the future had greatly increased <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#2:1:A>
Certainly it should not be a surprise <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#3:1:A>
If we look at the economic forecasts for nineteen ninety-seven our
economic growth predicted at five percent which will be better than that of
nineteen ninety-six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#4:1:A>
Our stock market is at all time high <,> and the transactions in the
stock market is more than that double of the same period of last year

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#5:1:A>
Confidence in property sector remains high <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#6:1:A>
Therefore we should look forward to a very good nineteen
ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#7:1:A>
Yet there are people trying to paint a gloomy picture about Hong
Kong  ' s future <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#8:1:A>
I think at the end that they will be greatly disappointed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#9:1:A>
The future Chief Executive and the provisional legislature had
already been in place <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#10:1:A>
It is my view that the provisional legislature should make lost
which are absolutely necessary on first of July nineteen ninety-seven <,>
such as nationality <,> definition of permanent residence SAR emblem and flag

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#11:1:A>
Other than these <,> the provisional legislature can look into laws
to reflect Article Twenty-Three of the Basic Law <,> and consider election
laws for the first legislature

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#12:1:A>
The earlier we have the election laws for the first legislature <,>
the faster <,> we can conduct elections

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#13:1:A>
There  ' re still people in our community trying to influence people
locally and internationally <,> that the provisional legislature is illegal

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#14:1:A>
I would like to make it perfectly clear <,> that the provisional
legislature is not constituted by Hong Kong law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#15:1:A>
It is constituted according to the National People  ' s Congress
Standing Committee  ' s resolution on thirtieth of August nineteen ninety-four
<,> giving the power to the Preparatory Committee to handle affairs related
to the establishment of SAR Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#16:1:A>
Therefore the provisional legislature is constituted by the Chinese
law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#17:1:A>
There is no question about the legality of the provisional
legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#18:1:A>
Of course there is added value <,> if the National People  ' s
Congress can reiterate that the provisional legislature is established under
the Chinese law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#19:1:A>
I would like to talk about some of the concerns of the senior civil
servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#20:1:A>
I  ' m in constant contact with our senior civil servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#21:1:A>
I certainly understand <,> that they will wish to continue to serve
the SAR Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#22:1:A>
It is a good indication <,> that the civil servants are committed
to Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#23:1:A>
I believe <,> they will continue to serve Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#24:1:A>
I have always maintained <,> that the civil service should be
politically neutral <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#25:1:A>
Unfortunately <,> as we witnessed the events unfold in the past few
years <,> that no one can deny that the civil service has been politicized

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#26:1:A>
The need to push legislations through legislature knowingly that
some of these legislations may not have a future post nineteen ninety-seven
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#27:1:A>
Yet they had to take up the political role <,> such as
constitutional reform in nineteen ninety-four <,> sadly had destroyed the
political arrangement of through train

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#28:1:A>
To this day they still had to say in public that the provisional
legislature is not necessary <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#29:1:A>
Yet after nineteen ninety-seven they have to work with the
provisional legislature

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#30:1:A>
Therefore I  ' m in support of the civil servants being politically
neutral <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#31:1:A>
The Executive Council should take up the political responsibilities
in policy formulation and selling the policies to the public

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#32:1:A>
The Executive Council must have the rule of confidentiality and
collective responsibility <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#33:1:A>
When they make decisions they should be held responsible

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#34:1:A>
The Liberal Party is investigating the blueprint of managing Hong
Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#35:1:A>
It was written based on our experience in public service <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#36:1:A>
We are of course concerned about the lack of attention being put on
economic restructuring <,> our economic development <,> and with particular
<,> emphasis <,> to industry <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#37:1:A>
We are also making proposals on people  ' s livelihood issues such as
housing education welfare for the elderly <,> transport <,> medical services
et cetera <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#38:1:A>
After completion <,> we will have the opportunity to meet Mr Tung
Chee Hwa to present our report

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#39:1:A>
The Liberal Party is confident <,> over the future of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#40:1:A>
We believe <,> we have a role to play in strengthen our economic
structure <,> and to improve the social needs of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#41:1:A>
We will publish report <,> after our meeting with Mr C H Tung <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#42:1:A>
I notice that the Chinese economy <,> grow by nine percent last
year and inflation was at six percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#43:1:A>
This is a very good news for Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#44:1:A>
After several years <,> the high inflation rate finally came under
control <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#45:1:A>
We should continue to expect a good growth rate of Chinese economy
<,> and Hong Kong will benefit from the economic growth rate of China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#46:1:A>
Our economic link with China is closer than ever before <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#47:1:A>
For many years the Liberal Party has suggested to Governor Patten
<,> that China is our largest trading partner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#48:1:A>
We should set up a China Hong Kong Economic Cooperation Committee
with a term of reference <,> same as Hong Kong US Economic Cooperation
Committee and Hong Kong Japan Economic Cooperation Committee <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#49:1:A>
As you know <,> these suggestions <,> fell on wayside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#50:1:A>
China being our largest trading partner and we are the largest
investor in China it is unthinkable <,> that we do not have such a body to
coordinate the economic activities of the two sides <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#51:1:A>
We are now making the similar suggestion to Mr Tung Chee Hwa <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#52:1:A>
Mr Tung being the Chairman of US Hong Kong Economic Cooperation
Committee <,> certainly will see the merits of setting up such a committee
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#53:1:A>
It is important for the future of Hong Kong <,> that we understand
the developments in China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#54:1:A>
When our businessmen and investors seeking assistance then we could
have an avenue to coordinate with China

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#55:1:A>
I  ' m hopeful that this committee will be setting up in the near
future <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#56:1:A>
Finally a few words about housing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#57:1:A>
I was greatly disappointed by the recent report that the production
of public sector housing will be short by fifty thousand units before <.> ni
</.> two thousand and one and from two thousand and one to two thousand and
four there will be a shortage of another fifty thousand units <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#58:1:A>
I  ' m sure the easy excuse is supply of land <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#59:1:A>
We should be clear that the supply of land of public housing is not
controlled by the Land Commission of the Joint Liaison Group <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#60:1:A>
The Hong Kong Government is solely responsible for the supply of
land for public sector housing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#61:1:A>
There  ' re many people came to see me complaining of the long
waiting time for public housing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#62:1:A>
Why we are in this situation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#63:1:A>
To me the answer is very simple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#64:1:A>
The government had miscalculated the increase in population <,> and
mismanaged the housing production <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#65:1:A>
This situation must be remedied <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#66:1:A>
I  ' m glad to hear Mr Tung Chee Hwa during his <,> campaign said <,>
that housing is the number one problem in Hong Kong that he will take steps
to alleviate the situation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#67:1:A>
I  ' m certain that the provisional legislature will monitor the
future plans for housing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#68:1:A>
I  ' m looking forward to the improvements in this area <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#69:1:A>
I believe with determination <,> this problem <,> can be resolved
</I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-022#70:2:A>
There  ' re only about a year left before the changing of
sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#71:2:A>
The hot subject at the moment <,> is who will be the Chief
Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#72:2:A>
My own view is <,> whoever will be the Chief Executive should
possess the following criteria <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#73:2:A>
Firstly the person must be acceptable and respected by China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#74:2:A>
It is very important that he can work with the Beijing authorities
on equal basis <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#75:2:A>
Therefore a person respected by China will be easier for him to
perform his duty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#76:2:A>
The Chinese leadership will take his advice as he defends Hong Kong
interests <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#77:2:A>
Secondly <,> the person must be accepted by the Hong Kong people
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#78:2:A>
Of course it is very difficult to guage <,> whether Hong Kong
people will support him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#79:2:A>
Nevertheless <,> the four hundred member selection committee surely
<,> in electing the Chief Executive <,> will consider the views of the Hong
Kong people <,> and members of the selection committee should be widely
represented

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#80:2:A>
I  ' m sure the Preparatory Committee in establishing the selection
committee <,> will consider clearly about the representation of each
individual member of the selection committee <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#81:2:A>
Therefore I  ' m in support of <,> nomination by organizations or
groups <,> even though the nominee will be there in individual capacity <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#82:2:A>
Thirdly <,> the person must be supported by the civil service <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#83:2:A>
The civil servants are the important ingredient of our future
success <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#84:2:A>
The Chief Executive must be able to work with the civil servants
<,> and being respected by the civil servants <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#85:2:A>
And finally <,> I would like to see our Chief Executive enjoys good
international reputation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#86:2:A>
Because Hong Kong is an international business and financial centre
there are major investments from the international circle <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#87:2:A>
This is why Hong Kong is highly successful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#88:2:A>
If our Chief Executive <,> establish himself with good
international reputation and knowing people in the political and business
circle will certainly enhance the confidence <,> of international investment
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#89:2:A>
And to a larger extent <,> they will continue to invest in Hong
Kong and recognize Hong Kong as an international business and financial
centre <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#90:2:A>
Before end of nineteen ninety-six <,> the Chief Executive will be
elected <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#91:2:A>
He will ensure a smooth transfer of power <,> and lay out policies
for governing Hong Kong in the future <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#92:2:A>
It will not be too long for the Hong Kong people to wait <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#93:2:A>
I certainly hope the uncertainty will be over by December nineteen
ninety-six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#94:2:A>
The second topic I want to talk about is our economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#95:2:A>
The government announced the GDP growth for the first quarter was
at a disappointing three percent <,> yet our Chief Economist and Financial
Secretary maintained <,> the second half of the year would be better <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#96:2:A>
Therefore they will not change the overall economic growth rate for
nineteen ninety six of five percent <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#97:2:A>
It does not take a great mathematician to figure out <,> what kind
of growth rate that would require in the subsequent quarters in order to
reach the five percent overall growth rate for nineteen ninety-six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#98:2:A>
I  ' m not trying to talk down our economic performance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#99:2:A>
Nevertheless we are experiencing slow down in in the retail and
restaurant sectors <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#100:2:A>
Our exports and re-exports may pick up a bit in the second half
<,> but it will be very difficult to reach the five percent overall growth
rate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#101:2:A>
I have mentioned on numerous occasions <,> that the government
should do something about our economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#102:2:A>
The Liberal Party has had made ten suggestions <,> which I do not
intend to repeat each and every one of them here but to our disappointment
the government had done nothing and take no measures to stimulate our economy
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#103:2:A>
So far it is only lip service

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#104:2:A>
We are not <,> only facing the challenge on the political front
but also face slow down in our economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#105:2:A>
I urge the government again <,> not only to pay attention to the
economic situation but <,> actively take measures to stimulate our much
needed recovery of the economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#106:2:A>
The third subject I would like to talk about is the provisional
legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#107:2:A>
I  ' m fully aware <,> that there are opposition voices with regard
to the setting up of the provisional legislature yet we all know this is the
result of no through train arrangement <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#108:2:A>
After seventeen rounds of talks in nineteen ninety-four <,> the
British side decided to withdraw from the negotiations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#109:2:A>
It is not the time now to blame neither the British nor the
Chinese while we are facing this situation

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#110:2:A>
The Preparatory Committee has already passed a resolution <,> of
establishing the provisional legislature <,> and it will last no more than
one year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#111:2:A>
The provisional legislature would be elected by the same selection
committee which will elect the Chief Executive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#112:2:A>
Therefore I estimate the setting up of the provisional legislature
will be some time not later than early next year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#113:2:A>
I hope to see all of my colleagues in the Legislative Council
today will stand for election to the provisional legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#114:2:A>
Whether one will be elected or not is <.> anoth </.> another
matter <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#115:2:A>
It is not the time to argue whether we need the set up of a
provisional legislature <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#116:2:A>
It is a fact <,> and it will be there <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#117:2:A>
It is time to participate <,> or at least to consider to
participate <,> in the process of its establishment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#118:2:A>
Finally I would like to speak on the subject of North West Railway
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#119:2:A>
I understand the consultancy contracts ready to be awarded by KCRC
amounts to seven hundred and fifty million dollars <,,> and I also understand
this <,> will not be the end of consultancy contracts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#120:2:A>
Of course I  ' m not an expert in railways <,> but to build a
forty-kilometer railway <,> and to pay such a huge amount of consultancy fee
<,> I would question the wisdom of KCRC and the government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#121:2:A>
Furthermore I understand to build this forty-kilometer railway
will cost over eighty billion Hong Kong dollars <,> which included five point
four billion dollars land acquisition cost <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#122:2:A>
This means <,> the cost for the railway is almost at two billion
dollars per kilometer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#123:2:A>
I ask <,> where in the world will have such an expensive railway
how much KCRC will charge the fares in the future in order to recover the
investment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#124:2:A>
The transport panel of the Legislative Council certainly will ask
these questions and seek answers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#125:2:A>
All in all <,> Hong Kong is prosperous <,> but not to the extent
to hand money to people <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#126:2:A>
We should never let it happen unless we understand what it is all
about <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-022#127:2:A>
We must do everything we can as legislators <,> to protect the
interests of the Hong Kong people </I>
