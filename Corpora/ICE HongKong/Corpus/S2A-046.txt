<I> 

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-046#1:1:A>
Okay uhm <,> the background for me to undertake uhm this
research is related to perhaps that uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#2:1:A>
I  ' m a member of the <?> Institute </?> Network and Pacific Asia

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#3:1:A>
So every year they organize a conference on a specific theme

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#4:1:A>
So uh this year they had a conference on cultural economy

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#5:1:A>
So uhm in Hong Kong uh uh yes Hong Kong <?> essence </?> uhm in <,,>
in sort of you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#6:1:A>
Two <?> set </?> which are related to cultural economy

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#7:1:A>
One is the film industry or the movie industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#8:1:A>
The other is probably tourism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#9:1:A>
Uhm since I don't really have a lot of connection with the black
society the underground world

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#10:1:A>
So I <,> <?> think </?> I like I probably cannot do too much
research in the movie industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#11:1:A>
And that  ' s why I choose uhm you know tourism <,> uhm to be my uhm
target uhm you know uhm <,> research area

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#12:1:A>
And <,> and then at that time uhm when I look at uhm tourism uh
promoting and tourism development

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#13:1:A>
Uh two of my uh MSC students are working on two case studies which
are related to uhm <,> <?> commoditifing </?> culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#14:1:A>
You know which is related to Tai O

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#15:1:A>
Trying to commercialize <,> <?> package </?> Tai O to attract more
tourists

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#16:1:A>
And the other is working on uhm the cultural district <?> where is
</?> the artist village

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#17:1:A>
Uhm uhm you know <?> taste </?> which I think it  ' s in a way trying
to <?> culturalize </?> something you know uhm some commodities in order to
uh make Hong Kong look you know better and be a city of life as <?>
applicated </?> by the tourists <,> uhm tourists abroad

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#18:1:A>
Uhm <,> so when I look at tourism promotion and then try to tie
these two case <,> studies together

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#19:1:A>
You know I sort of try to make the case that uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#20:1:A>
It  ' s actually quite difficult for tourism <,> uhm to sell sort of
Hong Kong  ' s culture uhm in promoting tourism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#21:1:A>
Basically because uhm the government has a very <?> net </?> and
very <unc> one-word </unc> world wrong attitude in heritage
conservation

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#22:1:A>
And it  ' s always emphasizing on building hardware <,> hardware
rather than uh nurturing a culture <.> com </.> community with local
characters

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#23:1:A>
So uh so that  ' s why I started you know this little paper

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#24:1:A>
Uh when Simon try to ask us to do presentations

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#25:1:A>
Well you know I I thought well maybe I can sort of do a little
presentation on it

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#26:1:A>
Anyway that  ' s what I want start of uhm to discuss in this <,>
presentation

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#27:1:A>
First I  ' ll talk about uhm you know the Hong Kong story in terms of
Hong Kong economic development and culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#28:1:A>
Uhm focusing on you know uhm <,> three uhm major areas

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#29:1:A>
One is <,> colonialism and local culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#30:1:A>
Uhm then capitalism and modern culture and then you know <unc>
one-word </unc> is global turn you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#31:1:A>
People call it you know is <,> is a cultural turn of uhm capitalism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#32:1:A>
Uh that we are seeing you know in in the process of globalization

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#33:1:A>
I want to talk a little bit about economic restructuring and the
<?> commodification </?> of culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#34:1:A>
And then uhm I move on to talk about the culture scene in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#35:1:A>
And look at uhm you know <,> quite interestingly you know tourism
promotion uhm in the pre and pro Asian financial crisis

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#36:1:A>
And basically we can see that before the Asian financial crisis
when people talk about tourism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#37:1:A>
They talk a lot about uhm you know infrastructure building

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#38:1:A>
You know providing better hardware whereas after you know uhm the
crisis uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#39:1:A>
They emphasize more on uhm culture <,> areas

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#40:1:A>
And then I  ' ll proceed to look at the two case studies

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#41:1:A>
The first one is <,> uhm the Tai O fishing village

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#42:1:A>
And <,> the other one is <,> uh basically the artist village

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#43:1:A>
And then I  ' ll move on to analysis and policy implications uh
briefly <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#44:1:A>
Uhm <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#45:1:A>
Another of uhm literature uhm try to talk about how <,> colonialism
has influenced uhm cultural development

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#46:1:A>
And here you know this one uhm from <?> Kane </?> uhm his work on
urban is on colonialism and the world economy

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#47:1:A>
And I try to sort of you know uh identify the key <,> characters
that characteristics that uhm he mention

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#48:1:A>
I see if it really you know a theme they really apply to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#49:1:A>
Uhm the red one sort of <,,> try to say that okay you know maybe
that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#50:1:A>
And and the blue one I don't think they are applicable

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#51:1:A>
Uhm <,> now basically you know uhm that a lot of uhm scholars argue
that pluralistic uh economy can be found uh in the in the colony

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#52:1:A>
That  ' s not quite true in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#53:1:A>
Especially <,> uhm in the post seventies

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#54:1:A>
Uhm and then present of large group of indigenous uh unskilled and
semi-skilled migrated workers

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#55:1:A>
Uhm <,> true to a certain extend but immigration of Chinese
mainlanders to Hong Kong has been tightly controlled

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#56:1:A>
Uhm so that  ' s you know that  ' s a little bit different from other
places

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#57:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> spending favouring colonial elite

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#58:1:A>
I I  ' ll argue yes uhm subject to debate and counter argument

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#59:1:A>
Dominant of church <?> respective </?> like colonial ages

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#60:1:A>
Hobbies yes until this uhm you know churchy set their interest you
know uhm until the <?> seventies </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#61:1:A>
And and parasitic relation will invidious rural set that  ' s not
applicable at all in Hong Kong as we are very urbanized basically

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#62:1:A>
Uhm indigenous rural credit <?> nation </?> nationalist elite

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#63:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#64:1:A>
In direct rule uhm an that  ' s quite true

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#65:1:A>
But basically true and competitive lack talk down government

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#66:1:A>
But a lot of the social and cultural dimension uhm do not really
apply to the case in the case of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#67:1:A>
Uhm <,> uhm like class like nature <?> urban </?> society

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#68:1:A>
I don't think you know we count that occupational <unc>
one-word </unc> by ethnic groups

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#69:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#70:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> institutional uhm you know structure
basically no

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#71:1:A>
Uhm residential <?> separation </?> by race

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#72:1:A>
Uh yes we do have that by class but probably not by race

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#73:1:A>
But anyway uh what I want <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#74:1:A>
You know I try to see is like

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#75:1:A>
You know to what extend our culture is being influenced by uhm the
fact that uhm you know we were a colony

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#76:1:A>
You know for <,> hundred or so you know years

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#77:1:A>
And <,> I would try to <.> si </.> you know argue that uhm you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#78:1:A>
Unlike other places where you know to quote from a home

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#79:1:A>
And he say the British colonizers had no interest in learning from
other long established urban cultures

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#80:1:A>
And sometimes <unc> one-word </unc> a violent physical
assort on <,> uh such cultures

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#81:1:A>
Just defining their actions by <unc> one-word </unc> uh
concern with issues of defence and public wealth

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#82:1:A>
Uhm uh yes we don't really have that uhm you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#83:1:A>
And <,> and also you know uhm <,> in fact a a kind to uhm some of
the uhm information that I can gather from people who work in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#84:1:A>
Uh basically you know they came to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#85:1:A>
Uh I mean in the government uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#86:1:A>
Because they they admire Chinese culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#87:1:A>
So they really you know some of them you know not probably not all
of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#88:1:A>
But they came here because they would like to learn more about
Chinese culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#89:1:A>
They have this admiration

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#90:1:A>
Uh but then when they come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#91:1:A>
You know because of that <,> it doesn't mean that they are
interested in the local culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#92:1:A>
Cause Hong Kong has its own very unique local culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#93:1:A>
Uhm <,> uhm which you know it  ' s a mixture of East and West high
and low culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#94:1:A>
You know uhm you know elegant elements et cetera elements if you
like traditional and modern

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#95:1:A>
Uhm <,,> but then it  ' s local culture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#96:1:A>
Uhm I would argue you know has born by neglect

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#97:1:A>
You know basically you know <,> little sort of uhm this kind of
culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#98:1:A>
Uhm it  ' s not really uhm taking very seriously uhm by <,> by the
important people you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#99:1:A>
Uhm <?> when </?> I tell you define it as

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#100:1:A>
And it  ' s uh very unique and rich local culture has survived uh in
between uh very <,> you know highly money and <unc> one-word </unc>
orientated

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#101:1:A>
You know and and economics uh you know dreams and society you know
which

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#102:1:A>
Uhm you know bring that to the argument that okay you know so how
colonialism but colonialism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#103:1:A>
Unlike other colonies uhm you know does not <?> leave </?> you
know a familiar kind of influence physical influence in a city

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#104:1:A>
With we still retain very rich local culture but this rich local
culture is not really <?> apps </?> appreciated

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#105:1:A>
You know uhm you know in the process

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#106:1:A>
Uhm and also you know <,> this local culture actually is being
squeezed you know in between uh capitalism

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#107:1:A>
Capitalistic kind of culture which <,> which you know you can call
it modern cultural you know and economics identify modernization with
industrialization with urbanization which actually are common to some people

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#108:1:A>
It  ' s actually at in <unc> one-word </unc> uhm conception
of culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#109:1:A>
Uhm modern culture as a <?> stylization applied </?> you know like
<,> have a taste you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#110:1:A>
I don't know you know how you would uh <,> uh you know define
taste

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#111:1:A>
But basically uhm you know it  ' s about uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#112:1:A>
I don't know living in bigger houses uh <,> good life appearance
richness you know rather than you know moral values uhm et cetera

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#113:1:A>
Uhm <,> like Ray <unc> one-word </unc> say you know
individuals in a capitalistic culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#114:1:A>
A position as consumers rather than citizens moral and political
issues are displaced by market position like calling to self interest

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#115:1:A>
And the public <?> rule root </?> is <?> definitely </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#116:1:A>
You know uhm <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#117:1:A>
So basically that so that  ' s another side of our culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#118:1:A>
We don't have local <,> indigenous you know culture growing by
neglect <?> in </?> habits

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#119:1:A>
We do have some colonial influence but not too much <?> accord
</?> to <,> you know uhm to the table that we  ' ve just seen

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#120:1:A>
And uh we we are squeezing between its capitalistic culture which
identified with with modernity modernization you know urbanization
industrialization

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#121:1:A>
But then uh well we all know the story in Hong Kong is that uhm
after the Asian financial crisis

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#122:1:A>
Uhm we are facing this <,> problem of <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#123:1:A>
Okay economic restructuring intensified

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#124:1:A>
You know in a way that uhm you know we like other you know places

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#125:1:A>
We need to diversify we recognize that we need to diversify our
economy

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#126:1:A>
And we also take the culture turn <,> you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#127:1:A>
We try to <?> commodifiy </?> uhm you know culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#128:1:A>
But basically uh we try to <?> commodify </?> culture in order <,>
to help us to sort of struggle through this very difficult economic period
rather than having <unc> one word </unc> that  ' s my my argument you
know uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#129:1:A>
Rather than really having a general interest in nurturing

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#130:1:A>
You know uhm the kind of <,> uhm culture uh that you know we are
having

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#131:1:A>
And <,> I try to argue <,> uh you know that in the two case
studies that I  ' m going to talk about

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#132:1:A>
But before we talk about the case studies

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#133:1:A>
Let  ' s let  ' s look at the cultural <,> uhm scene in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#134:1:A>
I would argue that actually we do have <,> you know <unc>
one-word </unc> amount of <unc> one-word </unc> cultural wealth

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#135:1:A>
The problem is <,> it  ' s wealth is not <,> being sort of you know
uhm valued and developed and stored

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#136:1:A>
And I don't know <?> package </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#137:1:A>
Uhm because of uh policy <unc> one-word </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#138:1:A>
Uhm <,,> like we do have <,> seven thousand pre ninety fifty
buildings according to Professor <?> Long </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#139:1:A>
But only sixty nine are declared monument

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#140:1:A>
Well you know that  ' s fair enough

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#141:1:A>
Because you know most of those buildings may not reserved <,> you
know monumental status

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#142:1:A>
But according to Long and <unc> one-word </unc> you know
they try to argue that uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#143:1:A>
The antiquity and monument uhm argument is weak

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#144:1:A>
There  ' s a lack of communication and cooperation among government
departments

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#145:1:A>
And there  ' s a lack of support from the general public

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#146:1:A>
Uh you know uh for heritage conservation

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#147:1:A>
Uh and and you know and more than that I  ' ll talk more about that
you know in a minute

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#148:1:A>
So <,> so government you know uhm does not really have uh sort of
an integrated policy uhm to really promote our culture uhm development

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#149:1:A>
Uhm and then the other you know thing is that uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#150:1:A>
In Hong Kong high cultures is always quite remote from the
majority of the population

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#151:1:A>
You know when I say high culture I you know <?> I  ' m </?> concert
opera

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#152:1:A>
You know these kind of things really quite alienated uh from the
general uh public

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#153:1:A>
Because according to the survey of public uhm <,> attitude

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#154:1:A>
A survey of facilities uses conducted by the <unc> one-word
</unc> department between mid nineteen ninety eight and early nineteen
ninety nine

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#155:1:A>
The level of participation in cultural activities was low

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#156:1:A>
With less than twenty percent of those respondents

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#157:1:A>
Right that they had participated in cultural <,> activities in
nineteen ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#158:1:A>
And most of them are young professionals with high educational <?>
attainment </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#159:1:A>
So you know high cultural actually <,> not a something quite
remote from the general uhm public

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#160:1:A>
Another thing which uhm you know is <?> third </?> quite typical
of Hong Kong is that uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#161:1:A>
All the institutional set up uhm you know <unc> one-word
</unc> related to cultural development

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#162:1:A>
They <?> plays </?> a lot of emphasis on the hardware

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#163:1:A>
You know a better building better facilities rather than you know
the people the quality of the people the human resources

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#164:1:A>
Uh I  ' m not going to <?> bore </?> you know bored you with all
these details

<ICE-HK:S2A-046#165:1:A>
But anyway uhm <,> uhm <,> that you know that is what a lot of uhm
uhm the artists in the field have <,> uhm sort of complaint </I>
