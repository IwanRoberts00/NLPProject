<bold> SYSTEM DESCRIPTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#2:1>
The RapidGlass system is based on several major components ,
namely the clients ' access computers , the RapidGlass network , the  ' Dispatcher'
, the secured corporate network , the  ' Auditor ' and the insurance companies'
computers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#3:1>
A user on the client side enters information into a standard glass
claim form .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#4:1>
The information is then coded into EDI format by the client front-end
program .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#5:1>
At the end of each day or at user-selected intervals , data are sent
to the RapidGlass system via either intranet or internet .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#6:1>
The data are then saved on segregated client storage areas on the
RapidGlass server .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#7:1>
This data needs to be transferred into the corporate network for
furthering processing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#8:1>
This is done by an agent software that checks the presence of client  ' s
inbound/outbound files at regular intervals and sends them to the corporate
network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#9:1>
This component is called the Dispatcher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#10:1>
Once the client data have been moved to the working storage on the
corporate network side on a DEC VAX computer system , the glass claims
processing software that resides on it processes the data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#11:1>
This program is called the Auditor . It retrieves information from
insurance companies ' mainframe computer systems and processes the claims .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#12:1>
Large amounts of information on insurance policies , coverage and
claim history are stored on mainframe computer databases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#13:1>
After processing , the output files are written for each glass repair
vendor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#14:1>
The Dispatcher is responsible for checking and moving the output file
from the working storage to the RapidGlass server to wait for the client  ' s
next access .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#15:1>
Every time a client accesses the network , the Dispatcher checks for
inbound files for collection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#16:1>
The inbound file contains the processed claims and the rejects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#17:1>
The client can then go back to each of the rejected claims and check
the error message for making appropriate corrections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#18:1>
The Auditor also has built-in usage accounting capability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#19:1>
The present system charges the insurance companies according to the
number of claims processed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#20:1>
There is also the possibility of charging the glass repair vendors on
either a monthly flat fee or a claims volume-based charging scheme .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#21:1>
The system provider can therefore harness the power of intranet and
internet to provide a value-added service to the insurance industry with a
means to support the running cost . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#22:1>
NETWORK DESCRIPTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#23:1>
Three networks make up the RapidGlass system , namely the public
network , the RapidGlass network and the insurance corporate network &obrack;  see
Figure 1 &cbrack; . </p> <O> Figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#24:1>
The public network can take many forms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#25:1>
It can be the worldwide internet or a private frame relay network or
even the telephone network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#26:1>
The RapidGlass system will allows three types of access to the
RapidGlass network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#27:1>
The first type is via internet into a firewall route then into the
RapidGlass network through routers over frame relay , lease lines , etc. .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#28:1>
The last type of connection is over the conventional telephone
network , clients use modems to dial into Netware Connect or a Microsoft RAS
server and gain access node over modem lines . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#29:1>
The RapidGlass network is an internal Local Area Network &obrack;  LAN)
owned and managed by Teleglobe Insurance Systems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#30:1>
At present , it is a 10Mbps Ethernet .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#31:1>
The purpose of this network is to enable clients to connect and get
access to front-end resources of the RapidGlass system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#32:1>
Since this network front-ends external clients , it is a separate
network dedicated for the purpose of the RapidGlass system; it has no
corporate network resources and carries no corporate network traffic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#33:1>
This network is managed by a Novell Managewise server .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#34:1>
Connected to this network are the RapidGlass server , a network
traffic capture station , access routers and the Dispatcher work station .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#35:1>
The insurance corporate network is an internal LAN owned and
managed by Teleglobe Insurance Systems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#36:1>
At present , it is a 10Mbps Ethernet . Many insurance companies have
their mainframe operations outsourced to Teleglobe Insurance Systems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#37:1>
Therefore , the corporate network provides access to many insurance
corporations ' mainframe computers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#38:1>
The RapidGlass LAN and the insurance corporate LAN are two separate
networks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#39:1>
The only connection between them is the Dispatcher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#40:1>
This has two interfaces inside the machine bound to each network
respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#41:1>
There is no routing function in the Dispatcher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#42:1>
Data transferring from one network to another are driven purely by
the Dispatcher application . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#43:1>
RapidGlass SYSTEM ACCESS </bold> </h> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#44:1>
via Internet </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#45:1>
RapidGlass clients can get access to the RapidGlass system via
the worldwide internet .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#46:1>
They can connect to a local Interest Service Provider &obrack;  ISP &cbrack; to get
onto the internet .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#47:1>
By using a web browser &obrack;  e.g. Netscape &cbrack; , a client can get to the
RapidGlass home page .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#48:1>
By logging in at the RapidGlass internet server home page , the
client can enter claims information from there or pick up return information
from the last processing batch .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#49:1>
The advantages of using internet as the access method include easy
connectivity , worldwide location independent and low communication cost with
respect to distance &obrack;  most cities/towns have Internet Service Providers
offering local dialing &cbrack; . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#50:1>
via direct access </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#51:1>
Direct access to the RapidGlass network can be arranged by
deploying a router on each side , one on the RapidGlass network and the other
at the client network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#52:1>
In between , a number of data carrying services can be employed for
the connection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#53:1>
Frame relay , ISDN and fractional T1 are popular choices for
interconnection between networks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#54:1>
By direct connection , clients have direct access to the RapidGlass
server .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#55:1>
Clients can log into the server and copy files directly onto the
designed client area as required or use the RapidGlass internet server and go
through the home page .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#56:1>
The advantages of using direct access are full-time dedicated
connection and usually a higher speed than a 28.8Kbs modem line . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#57:1>
via telephone network </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#58:1>
Going via the conventional telephone network represents the
easiest method to connect to the RapidGlass network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#59:1>
The present implementation requires clients to use remote access
software to connect to the RapidGlass server .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#60:1>
The advantage of using this method of connection is ease of setting
up . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#61:1>
RapidGlass SERVER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#62:1>
The RapidGlass server is a Netware server that forms a platform
for hosting file/print services , Netware Connect and internet server .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#63:1>
It holds all the client accounts and filing structure to keep client
inbound and outbound files .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#64:1>
It serves IPX &obrack;  Internetwork Packet Exchange &cbrack; and Internet Protocol
providing direct access clients with a choice of protocol to use on their
routes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#65:1>
It also has an internet server to host the web pages .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#66:1>
Netware Connect uses the multiple modem interface to serve clients
who prefer to come into the system via the telephone network . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#67:1>
Dispatcher </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#68:1>
The Dispatcher is responsible for transferring files to and from
the insurance corporate network and the RapidGlass network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#69:1>
At present , the activities of the Dispatcher are controlled by a
selectable timer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#70:1>
The Dispatch  ' wakes up ' every 30 minutes to check whether there are
files waiting to be transferred and moves them , if required .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#71:1>
Client  ' s inbound files are transferred from the RapidGlass server to
a DEC VAX computer on the insurance corporate network side .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#72:1>
Outbound file destined for clients go the other way .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#73:1>
The file transfer is accomplished via FTP &obrack;  File Transfer Protocol &cbrack; .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#74:1>
Client work station software </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#75:1>
There are several variants of client software depending the
client  ' s choice of access to the RapidGlass network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#76:1>
For internet access , clients can go through the RapidGlass
homepage or FTP files directly to their destined directory after a log-in
authentication process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#77:1>
Common web browsers support home page browsing and data entry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#78:1>
If FTP is preferred , a separated FTP program needs to be used .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#79:1>
Batch files can be supplied to clients to automate the process . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#80:1>
For direct access , clients have the maximum flexibility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#81:1>
They can choose to log into the RapidGlass server and transfer files
into the target directory .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#82:1>
They can also contact the RapidGlass server via a web browser and go
through the home page .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#83:1>
Using FTP to transfer files is another option for direct access
clients . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#84:1>
For telephone network access , clients work stations will have
Netware Connect set up for dialing out to the RapidGlass server , then a
batch program to log in and transfer the necessary files . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#85:1>
All clients , regardless of their access methods , have a
software module that acts as a claim form front end to allow users to enter
claim forms into the system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#86:1>
This module also allows claim forms to be edited when required . </p>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#87:1>
Auditor </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#88:1>
The Auditor program on the DEC VAX complies the incoming forms
and processes the claims for each client file submission .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#89:1>
The successful claims and the rejects are stored in a file and put
back into the client  ' s outbound directory .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#90:1>
When processing claims , the insurance corporate network is used for
accessing the databases on the insurance companies ' mainframe computers .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#91:1>
Service pricing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#92:1>
To finance the set up and the maintenance of the RapidGlass
system , a charge by using method is employed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#93:1>
The Auditor keeps track of how many records/claims have been
processed for each Automotive glass vendor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#94:1>
The usage of the system is billed back to the client on the basis of
claims processes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#95:1>
This generates a constant revenue stream for Teleglobe Insurance
System .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#96:1>
The charge per claim processes is low because the claim volume is
sufficient and consistent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#97:1>
Once an Auto Glass vendor signs up to use the system , the system is
likely to be used everyday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#98:1>
The Auto Glass vendors also like to use this system because it is
fast , cuts down on paper work and saves mailing costs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#99:1>
Also , the claim forms are now checked by a computer and rejects
returned on the same day; this speeds up the claim process and allows
companies to handle a large volume of claims .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#100:1>
The existing paper-based system involves a much longer turn around
cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#101:1>
A more efficient claims system also means faster payout and improves
cash flow for the user . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#102:1>
To gain access to the RapidGlass network , clients are required
to purchase the networking equipment they put into the RapidGlass network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#103:1>
The RapidGlass network access can also be structured into a revenue
generating opportunity because different access methods provide clients with
different degrees of convenience .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#104:1>
The concept is clients will pay for an access charge to the
RapidGlass network according to their access methods , but the back-end
claims processing charges will remain unchanged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#105:1>
The RapidGlass network brings in connectivity from clients
through various means , this opens up other opportunities in the future to
add services to the present offering. </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#106:1>
Security </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#107:1>
One of the biggest concerns when providing services over the
public network is security .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#108:1>
The thought of host computers exposed to outside attacks and data at
risk is unacceptable to any organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#109:1>
Connection to the internet immediately means the network will be
opened for access on a worldwide scale .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#110:1>
To protect corporate network safety , the RapidGlass system is
designed to gave a front-end RapidGlass network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#111:1>
The RapidGlass network is physically a different network from
the insurance corporate network , therefore traffic on it is only for
RapidGlass application .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#112:1>
The servers and routers connected to this network are also only for
RapidGlass application .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#113:1>
The RapidGlass server only front-ends the client log-ins and offers
temporally inbound and outbound file storage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#114:1>
It does not store any long-term customers files or records .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#115:1>
If the server does due to any reason , the previous back up can be
restored and no long-term data will be lost .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#116:1>
The inbound and outbound claims processes that day will also be
backed up on the servers on the other side of the insurance corporate network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#117:1>
This arrangement offers a high degree of fault-tolerance for the
server and its filing system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#118:1>
Since the gateway between the RapidGlass network and the
insurance corporate network is held by the Dispatcher , the latter has some
important features worth noting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#119:1>
It has two network interface adapters: is bounded to the RapidGlass
network and the other to the insurance corporate network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#120:1>
Any operating system or application-associated routing between the
two networks is removed or completely disabled .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#121:1>
The transfer of data from one network to the other is then left
entirely to the responsibility of the Dispatcher application .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#122:1>
This transports data files between the two networks , even when
files are transferred .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#123:1>
Not allowing any frames to go from one network to another provides a
strong means of stopping illegal frames from accessing the back-end corporate
network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#124:1>
Past statistics showed that most security systems are
compromised from within the organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#125:1>
In the RapidGlass system , there are no users on the RapidGlass
network except the Dispatcher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#126:1>
This is a dedicated machine , housed in a high security locked room
as the network infrastructure equipment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#127:1>
The other main source of work station connectivity to the RapidGlass
network comes from clients that have direct access via routers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#128:1>
In this case , a registration system can pre-register the MAC
address of the work stations on the client side authorized to get into the
RapidGlass network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#129:1>
The MAC address list can be stored and monitored from the router .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#130:1>
To enhance security over internet access , a dedicated firewall
can be introduced between the internet access router and the RapidGlass
network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#131:1>
The internet server can also operate from a separate dedicated
server . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#132:1>
A network security capture device is on the network as a
trouble-shooting resource; it also records all the MAC and higher level
addresses as they appear on the network .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#133:1>
This provides a mechanism to check all the users are legal and , if
new addresses are recorded , investigation can start early . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#134:1>
The possibility of virus infection has not been overlooked on
the system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#135:1>
A virus check server module is in place to provide a regular check
of the file server for viruses . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#136:1>
System scalability </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#137:1>
The RapidGlass system can be scaled to support a large user
publication by putting more servers on the system to the distribute the load
when the number of clients increases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#138:1>
More network bandwidth can be provided by segmenting the Ethernet
and giving each segment its own Dispatcher or secondary Dispatcher . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#139:1>
CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-033#140:1>
The RapidGlass system provides a solution for the present widely
geographically dispersed Auto Glass repair shops all over Ontario Province ,
Canada to submit and process Auto Glass claims effectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#141:1>
A large amount of paper work is eliminated in process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#142:1>
Immediately , there is less wastage and fewer problems in losing
documentation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#143:1>
The network linkage also defeats the distance between sites and the
insurance companies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#144:1>
By computerizing the claims processing from the client  ' s end , the
insurance companies no longer need a large team of staff to process the claim
forms that used to come in paper form through the mail .

<ICE-HK:W2A-033#145:1>
The whole process is thus streamlined and clients get processed
results much more quickly . </p>
