<ICE-HK:W2A-025#3:1>
Assisted reproductive technology refers to procedures in which the
oocyte in handled or manipulated in vitro before replacement , either as an
occyte or an embryo .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#4:1>
Because of rapid advances in this area , infertile couples may seek
direct referral for assisted reproductive treatments , instead of trying
simpler measures such as ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#5:1>
It is important to establish whether these conventional infertility
treatments are appropriate , as such treatments are generally safer , less
stressful , and more affordable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#6:1>
On the other hand , subjecting infertile couples to unnecessary delay
by offering inappropriate treatments - for example , ovulation induction for
tubal infertility or intrauterine insemination for severe male-factor
infertility - would reduce the overall chance of success because of the
age-related decline in female fecundity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#7:1>
The choice of infertility treatments thus depends on a balance of
factors: the chance of pregnancy without treatment; the chance with simpler
and safer , but less successful , infertility treatments; or the chance with
the more complex and costly , but more effective , assisted reproductive
treatments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#8:1>
The factors that should be taken into consideration include the age of
the woman , the duration of infertility , the causes of infertility , the
availability and cost of alternative treatments , and - most importantly -
the acceptability . </bold> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#9:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#10:1>
Infertility is defined as the failure by a couple of reproductive
age to conceive after 12 months or more of regular coitus without using
contraception .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#11:1>
This definition is based on epidemiological studies , which have
shown that 80&percent; of couples in the general population normally conceive by that
stage. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#12:1>
It is estimated that 15&percent; of couples living in developed countries are
infertile. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#13:1>
There has been no major change in prevalence , but there has been an
increase in demand for treatment during the past decade because of the
perception that effective assisted reproductive technology &obrack;  ART &cbrack; treatments
are now available .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#14:1>
Table 1 summaries the ART procedures that are most commonly practiced
throughout the world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#15:1>
Although ART was initially developed for patients with tubal
infertility , it is currently used for almost all kinds of infertility
problem , because its success rates are expected to be higher than those of
conventional treatments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#16:1>
However , ART treatment also has disadvantages .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#17:1>
It involves greater expense , and potentially serious complications
such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies can occur .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#18:1>
There are also fears that drugs that induce ovulation may increase
the risk of ovarian cancer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#19:1>
Infertility treatment should therefore be individualised to avoid
subjecting couples to unnecessary use of ART treatments , or to inappropriate
delay because of undertreatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#20:1>
Table 2 summaries common infertility treatments and their
indications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#21:1>
It should be emphasised that the choice of treatment is also
influenced by other factors such as the age of the woman and the duration of
infertility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#22:1>
The age of the female partner is one of the most important factors
determining spontaneous fertility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#23:1>
It is also a major factor in determining the success of any form of
infertility treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#24:1>
Using the database established in 1991 by the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority , Templeton èt al <sp> 3 </sp> analysed 36961 in vitro
fertilisation &obrack;  IVF &cbrack; cycles that <O> Table </O> were performed in the United
Kingdom .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#25:1>
They found a marked decline in pregnancy rates in women older than 35
years , and no pregnancies were recorded for women older than 45 years except
in the oocyte donation programme .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#26:1>
It seems that although young patients in their 20s may have the
option to use safer but only moderately effective treatments , by their late
30s , treatment should be more aggressive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#27:1>
On the other hand , aggressive infertility treatments should be
discouraged in women in their 40s because of poor success rates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#28:1>
The duration of infertility is another major factor determining the
likelihood of spontaneous pregnancy in untreated infertile couples. <sp> 4
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#29:1>
As most infertility is not absolute but includes some degree of
subfertility , many couples have a background chance of conceiving naturally .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#30:1>
The longer the duration of infertility , however , the less likely is
that probability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#31:1>
This predictive value is of particular importance to couples with
unexplained infertility . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#32:1>
Even in normal couples with proven fertility , the average
monthly conception rate is only 20&percent; to 25&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#33:1>
The peak rate is 33&percent; in the first month of trying , falling rapidly
to approximately 5&percent; each month thereafter. <sp> 5 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#34:1>
The expectation of any infertility treatment must be judged against
this finding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#35:1>
Infertility treatment should be offered when the chance of conceiving
naturally is unacceptable low &obrack;  <1&percent; to  2&percent; per cycle or 20&percent; to 30&percent; after  2
years). <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#36:1>
Simple treatment such as ovulation induction and intrauterine
insemination &obrack;  IUI &cbrack; are suitably only in certain situations &obrack;  Table 2 &cbrack; and
will be expected to achieve a pregnancy rate of approximately 10&percent; per cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#37:1>
Assisted reproductive techniques are suitable for almost all kinds of
infertility problems , but treatment with even the most advanced ART is
expected to achieve only a 25&percent; to 30&percent; success rate per cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#38:1>
Treatment may need to be repeated several times before success is
achieved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#39:1>
As a constant rise in the cumulative pregnancy rtes during the six
initial <O> Table </O> cycles has been demonstrated, <sp> 7 </sp> in general
it is worth pursuing treatment for up to six cycles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#40:1>
Before an infertile couple is recruited into an IVF programme , they
should be warned that both the cumulative pregnancy and live-birth rates
decline with the age of the woman .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#41:1>
Tan el al <sp> 8 </sp> have reported that the cumulative pregnancy
and live-birth rates after five IVF cycles were 54&percent; and 45&percent; , respectively ,
at age <35  years , 38.7&percent; and 28.9&percent; at 35 to 39  years , and 20.2&percent; and 14.4&percent;
at age = 40 years. <sp> 8 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#42:1>
The stress , time away from work , cost , and complications of the
treatment should also be emphasized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#43:1>
Alternatives such as adoption or childlessness should be discussed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#44:1>
Patient acceptability is very important , but it is often neglected
during the infertility evaluation . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#45:1>
Infertility evaluation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#46:1>
The Figure summaries the investigation and management of an
infertile couple .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#47:1>
The cornerstone of any infertility evaluation relies on the
assessment of coital difficulties , cervical or immunological factors ,
ovulation , tuboperitoneal pathology , and semen quality . </p> <h> <it>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#48:1>
Assessment of coital , cervical , or immunological problems </bold>
</it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#49:1>
Coital difficulties should be recognised if a detailed sexual
history is obtained .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#50:1>
Cervical or immunological factors need to be considered when results
from post-coital tests are repeatedly negative .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#51:1>
Further investigations to detect antibodies against components of
sperm and then necessary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#52:1>
The use of systemic corticosteriods to treat men who have anti-sperm
antibodies is not recommended , as the evidence of benefit is conflicting and
there are potentially serious side effects such as aseptic hip necrosis. <sp>
9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#53:1>
Treatment using IUI with or without ovarian stimulation can bypass
the problem of sperm progression through cervical mucus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#54:1>
However , ART should be considered after repeated failure of IUI
treatments . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#55:1>
Assessment of ovulation </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#56:1>
A detailed menstrual , medical , and drug history should be
obtained .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#57:1>
Women with normal regular menstrual cycles of 28 to 30 days are
usually ovulating .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#58:1>
Simple assessments such as a biphasic pattern of the basal body
temperature chart or an appropriate rise of the midluteal serum progesterone
concentration provide presumptive evidence of ovulation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#59:1>
In patients with suspected anovulation , the following tests
should be performed: measurement of the levels of follicle-stimulating
hormone &obrack;  FSH &cbrack; , Iuteinizing hormone &obrack;  LH &cbrack; , oestradiol , and testosterone &obrack; 
all samples having been taken at early follicular phase before day 5 of the
cycle &cbrack; , as well as the prolactin level and the thyroid function test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#60:1>
After excluding any secondary medical or endocrine causes ,
anovulatory problems are usually categorized under four conditions. <sp> 10
</sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#61:1>
Hyperprolactinaemic anovulation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#62:1>
Patients with hypergonadotrophic anovulation may present with
galactorrhoea .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#63:1>
If a serum prolactin concentration confirms hyperproclactinaemia ,
investigations to exclude a pituitary adenoma and hypothyroidism are
performed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#64:1>
These tests comprise computerized tomo-graphy or magnetic resonance
imaging of the pituitary gland and the thyroid function test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#65:1>
Taking a detailed drug history is also important , because the use of
some commonly prescribed drugs such as phenothiazine , haloperidol ,
metoclopramide , cimetidine , and methyldopa is associated with
hyperprolactinaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#66:1>
The first-line treatment is the use of dopamine agonists such as
bromocriptine .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#67:1>
These drugs can be combined with anti-oestrogens , if ovulation does
not occur despite normalised prolactin concentrations. <sp> 11 </sp> </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#68:1>
Hypogonadotrophic anovulation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#69:1>
The causes of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism are often functional
and transient .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#70:1>
Anovulation may be stress-induced or related to weight loss or
excessive exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#71:1>
An organic cause should be excluded , however , particularly if there
are neurological symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#72:1>
The evidence for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is a low level of FSH
, LH , and oestrogen , and the absence of withdrawal bleeding after a
progesterone challenging test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#73:1>
The primary aim of treatment should be to correct the underlying
cause .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#74:1>
It has been shown that spontaneous ovulation will return in
underweight women after correction of their nutritional deficiency. <sp> 12
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#75:1>
Anti-oestrogens are not effective in this condition , owing to the
non-functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#76:1>
Ovulation induction should be achieved by using either a pulsatile
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone &obrack;  GnRH &cbrack; or gonadotrophins in a specialist
infertility centre , in which the woman is intensively monitoring during
ovulation induction . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#77:1>
Hypergonadotrophic anovulation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#78:1>
Hypergonadotrophic anovulation implies ovarian resistance or
failure and is diagnosed when plasma concentrations of FSH are higher than 20
IU/L from repeated measurements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#79:1>
If the patient is younger than 40 years , this condition should be
further investigated and treated as a premature menopause .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#80:1>
The only effective practical treatment for hypergondotrophic
anovulation is oocyte donation . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#81:1>
Normogonadotrophic anovulation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#82:1>
Patients with normogonadotrophic anovulation have normal FSH
concentrations , but LH concentrations may be elevated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#83:1>
They are not hypo-oestrogenic and will bleed in response to a
progesterone withdrawal test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#84:1>
The majority of these women have polycystic ovaries. <sp> 13 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#85:1>
This condition should be suspected of the woman is obese and hirsute
, or if there is hyperandro-genaemia or an elevated LH to FSH ratio. <sp> 13
</sp> Polycystic ovaries can be diagnosed using ultrasonography . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#86:1>
Apart weight loss in obese normogonado-trophic anovulation
patients, <sp> 14 </sp> the first-line treatment is the use of
anti-oestrogens such as colmifene &obrack;  clo-miphene &cbrack; citrate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#87:1>
The starting dose of clomifene is 50mg/d for 5 days , from day 2 to
day 6 of each cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#88:1>
The dosage can be increased in monthly increments up 200mg/d .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#89:1>
Early referral to specialist infertility centers should be considered
if patients are still anovulatory at the maximum dosage &obrack;  clomifene
resistance &cbrack; or if there is failure to conceive after 12 cycles of successful
treatment with confirmation of ovulation &obrack;  clomifene failure &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#90:1>
The alternatives for patients with clomifene resistance polycystic
ovarian disease are either medical induction of ovulation with pulsatile GnRH
or gonadotrophins , or surgical treatment with ovarian wedge resection or
laparoscopic ovarian drilling .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#91:1>
Medical treatments provide a good cumulative pregnancy rate , but
they increase the risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation.
<sp> 10 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#92:1>
The spontaneous ovulation rate after surgical treatment is reported
to be 60&percent; to 80&percent;, <sp> 15,16 </sp> but the efficacy in terms of pregnancy and
the ovarian damage associated with the procedure has yet to be evaluated .
<sp> 17 </sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#93:1>
Assessment and treatment of tuboperitoneal disease </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#94:1>
Tubal damage and pelvic adhesions may result from pelvic
inflammatory disease , or may be secondary to endometriosis or previous lower
abdominal or pelvic surgery .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#95:1>
There is still debate regarding the appropriate time for testing
tubal patency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#96:1>
Early investigation for tuboperitoneal pathology should be undertaken
when there is a suspicious history or the presence of symptoms such as
dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#97:1>
However , in low-risk patients , the common practice is to delay a
test of tubal patency until there have been up to six to 12 ovulatory cycles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#98:1>
This approach has been challenged , however , as pelvic infection or
endometriosis can be completely silent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#99:1>
Serological tests for <it> Chlamydia trachomatis </it> infection have
been suggested as a simple screening method for unsuspected previous
inflection , which would indicates likely tubal damage. <sp> 18 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#100:1>
Early laparoscopy is then indicated in seropositive women. <sp> 19
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#101:1>
Methods used to assess tubal patency include laparoscopy with
chromotubation , or hysterosalpingo-graphy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#102:1>
The latter technique may be used as a screening test for tubal
patency in low-risk patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#103:1>
However , laparoscopy with chromotubation should be the preferred
method of investigation , particularly when there is a strong suspicion of
peritoneal disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#104:1>
Laparoscopy may also be necessary when there is a hysterosalpinogram
showing suspected false-positive results due to tubal spasm or during
planning for infertility surgery . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#105:1>
The two choices for the treatment of tubal infertility are tubal
surgery or IVF .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#106:1>
In general , pregnancy rates after tubal surgery are not as good as
those achieved by IVF .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#107:1>
The overall 2-year cumulative pregnancy rate after tubal surgery is
only 20&percent;, <sp> 20 </sp> which can now be expected in a single cycle of IVF
treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#108:1>
Tubal surgery may still be appropriate in carefully selected cases ,
because different types of tubal surgery have different prognoses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#109:1>
Surgery may be offered in cases of mild pelvic adhesions , proximal
tubal obstruction , or mild distal tubal disease , although the eventual
chance of pregnancy after 2 years is not much more than 50&percent;. <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#110:1>
Hence , if a pregnancy has not occurred within 12 months &obrack;  at most
24 months &cbrack; of tubal surgery , IVF should be offered . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#111:1>
Owing to the poor prognosis of tubal surgery , IVF should be the
first-line treatment for significant pelvic adhesions or moderate-to-severe
distal tubal disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#112:1>
Early referral for IVF is also necessary for women of advanced age
or when coexisting problems such as male-factor infertility are present .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#113:1>
Endometriosis-associated infertility </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#114:1>
Endometriosis , even of a minor degree , is associated with
marked subfertility. <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#115:1>
Medical treatment of endometriosis has no proven benefit in
infertility. <sp> 21,22 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#116:1>
On the contrary , the chance of pregnancy is delayed by the duration
of medical treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#117:1>
Surgical ablation of minimal-to-mind endometriosis has been shown to
improve fertility in subfertile women, <sp> 23 </sp> so this should be
considered at the time of a diagnostic laparoscopy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#118:1>
Ovulation induction by using IUI should be offered to patients with
minimal-to-mild endometriosis if the duration of infertility is more than 3
years , as studies have shown that ovualtion induction with IUI is more
effective than either no treatment or IUI alone. <sp> 24 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#119:1>
There is no evidence that medical treatment of
moderate-to-severe endometriosis either alone or as an adjunct to surgery
improves fertility. <sp> 21,22 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#120:1>
Surgical treatment of moderate-to-severe endometriosis has been
shown to improve fertility , but a full explanation of the high surgical risk
should be given. <sp> 22,25 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#121:1>
In vitro fertilization should also be offered as an alternative to
or following unsuccessful surgery. <sp> 9 </sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

Semen quality and the treatment of male-factor infertility </bold>
</it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#123:1>
Table 3 lists the criteria of the World Health Organization &obrack; 
WHO &cbrack; for normal semen characteristics. <sp> 26 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#124:1>
It has been estimated that less than 10&percent; of male-factor infertility
is amenable to conventional medical or surgical treatments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#125:1>
Referral for IUI or ART procedures should be considered if there are
two abnormal semen samples that have been taken at least 3 months apart. <sp>
26 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#126:1>
In patients with borderline semen abnormality , sperm
preparation for IUI may correct the abnormality , but a minimal of 10 million
motile sperm per whole sample is still required .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#127:1>
For a severe semen-factor &obrack;  sperm concentration
&less-than;10 million  spermatozoa per milliliter;  or &less-than;20&percent; motility; or  
&less-than;20&percent; normal forms &cbrack; or when there is  history of fertilisation failure , IVF
and intracytoplasmic sperm injection &obrack;  ICSI &cbrack; should be the primary treatment
option. <sp> 27 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#128:1>
With the <O> Table </O> introduction of ICSI , which requires only a
single sperm to be injected per oocyte , it is now possible to use epididymal
or testicular sperm even when there are no sperm in the ejaculate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#129:1>
Epididymal sperm can be obtained by performing microsurgical
epididymal sperm aspiration in men with non-obstructive azoospermia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#130:1>
It is thus worthwhile referring affected couples to specialist
infertility centres for urological assessment and , if necessary , to perform
sperm recovery and ICSI .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#131:1>
However , prior to offering any treatment to these couples ,
particular consideration should be given to the relevant genetic issues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#132:1>
Increasing evidence has suggested a genetic linkage to reproductive
failure in 10&percent; to 30&percent; of men with severe oligoasthenoteratospermia. <sp> 28
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#133:1>
Accordingly , these patients should be counseled about the
possibility of transmitting sex chromosomal aberrations or fertility problems
to their offspring before they are recruited into the ICSI programmes. <sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#134:1>
Unexplained infertility </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-025#135:1>
In 20&percent; of couples presenting with infertility , a detailed
history and examination followed by complete investigation will fail to
elicit any clear explanation for the couple  ' s problem .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#136:1>
The main factors determining the chance of conceiving naturally are
the duration of infertility , the woman  ' s age and the previous pregnancy
history. <sp> 4,30 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#137:1>
As the spontaneous conception rate only starts to significantly
decrease after 3 years of trying, <sp> 30 </sp> conservative management until
then could be considered , taking into account the woman  ' s age. <sp> 9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#138:1>
There is no evidence of any benefit from clomifene treatment, <sp>
31 </sp> and assisted conception should wait , except when the female partner
is in her late 30s .

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#139:1>
After more than 3 years of infertility , the chances of natural
conception ate negligible. <sp> 30 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-025#140:1>
Ovulation induction with IUI is a simple and moderately effective
treatment, <sp> 32 </sp> and in general it is worth pursuing for up to six
cycles of treatment , before considering ART .
