<ICE-HK:S2A-041#1:1:A>
Good afternoon Madam speaker <,> honorable adjudicators <,>
member of this house <,> ladies and gentlemen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#2:1:A>
In the long term <,> we our side foresee some developments which
will incur an necessity of having the twenty-four hour <.> bord </.> border
crossing <,> with Shenzhen

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#3:1:A>
First of all <,> at present <,> we have an <,> on average about two
hundred and thousand people pass the check point

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#4:1:A>
However <,> after five years <,> the number of commuters will
increase to about three hundred thousands to four hundred thousand people <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#5:1:A>
We say there is a genuine need to operate the border crossing for
twenty-four hours <,> to smooth the human traffic <,> and transition <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#6:1:A>
Second of all <,> now it is determined that China will enter into
the WTO <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#7:1:A>
With China  ' s <?> accession </?> to WTO and the globalization of
other countries across the world <,> we foresee that the number of trade
opportunities in Hong Kong <,> will definitely be increased <,> so we say <,>
it will do good to Hong Kong by having the twenty-four hour border crossing
to smooth the transition <,> and strengthen the economic tie between Pearl
River <?> Delta </?> <,> Shenzhen and Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#8:1:A>
Before open before opening up our case I would like to deal with the
rebuttals one by one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#9:1:A>
First of all <,> the other side said that <,> Hong Kong the
relocations of Hong Kong businessmen to China <,> will weaken the
competitiveness <,> of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#10:1:A>
However <,> they say the relocation is a competition against Hong
Kong but we say the relocation is a cooperation with Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#11:1:A>
Why do I say so <,> because <,> as we all know that <,> China has
the <,> advantage of cheap labor cost and cheap land cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#12:1:A>
However <,> Hong Kong <,> also has its own advantage <,> that is
its technological advancement

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#13:1:A>
While Hong Kong businessmen may make use of uh the cheap labor and
cheap uh land in China <,> Hong Kong businessmen still have to depend on the
technological advancement in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#14:1:A>
So actually by smoothing <,> uh the transition uh between the two
places <,> their economic tie will be strengthened by having them to
cooperate with each other on their mutual benefits <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#15:1:A>
And second rebuttal is that <,> they say <,> uhm that <.> th </.>
this uh policy is just for a minority of <.> busines </.> businessmen <,> but
however we say <,> if the economic tie <?> bid </?> with China is strengthen
<,> then the whole Hong Kong economy will be strengthened <,> and then <,>
with the strengthened Hong Kong economy the whole population of Hong Kong
people will be <.> benef </.> will be benefited from that

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#16:1:A>
And third uh arguments of rebuttal is that <,> they say the
twenty-four hour policy is a kind of <,> uh wasting manpower <,> but we say
this is not <,> because uhm we can <.> d </.> uh depend on the technological
devices <,> like using uh the smartcard uh uh to uh pass through the uh check
point

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#17:1:A>
With with these electronic devices <,> we say <,> uhm this is uh we
don't need a lot of manpower <,> so this is not a waste of manpower <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#18:1:A>
And after dealing with the rebuttal <,> I would like to tell you
what the actual government policy is doing now <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#19:1:A>
Now the governments confine the twenty-four hour border crossing at
Lok Ma Chau <,> and so we have to do with Lok Ma Chau

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#20:1:A>
And <,> uhm building up uh having the check point at Lok Ma Chau
will do good to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#21:1:A>
Why do I say so <,> because there will be a railway running between
Hong Kong and China at Lok Ma Chau in year two thousand and four <,> so with
a <.> twe </.> uh with a twenty-four hour uh <.> bord </.> border crossing
check point at Lok Ma Chau <,> this is this would definitely do good to Hong
Kong <,> because this would strengthen the tie and communication <,> by
having a railway there <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#22:1:A>
And so we say this government policy is beneficial to three main
arguments <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#23:1:A>
First argument is about the philosophical argument about one
country and two system <,> and second argument is about the economic concern
<,> about economic cooperation and tourism <,> and third argument is about
the feasibility <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#24:1:A>
And now and I as a captain will deal with the philosophical point

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#25:1:A>
Under the one country two system <,> we <,> Hong Kong as is
supposed to have a strong tie with <.> Hong </.> uh China both economically
and socially

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#26:1:A>
And we say by implementing this twenty-four hour policy will
increase this tie

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#27:1:A>
And this spirit of tie uh with China is actually echoing <,> uh
with the basic law

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#28:1:A>
I quote from the basic law from article one <,> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#X29:1:A>
<quote> The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region <,> is an
inalienable part of the People  ' s Republic of China </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#30:1:A>
So <,> this is the philosophical basis that we want to put forward
today <,> and <,> the second point would be dealt the second point of
economic <.> poin </.> uh <.> poin </.> uh arguments and feasibility argument
will be dealt with my <.> s </.> first speaker Christine <,> and <,> uh my
second speaker will deal with the rebuttals and so on

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#31:1:A>
And so for all these reason I  ' m proud to open the case

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#32:1:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-041#33:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen a very good afternoon

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#34:2:A>
Uhm firstly I think one of the main fallacies that the negative
side has been making is that <,> I like to remind you even in China there is
a system of not not free flow within China  ' s <unc> 1-syllable </unc>
China  ' s provinces and therefore uhm I think their point on that there is
free flow in China does not does not stand <,> and further they had mentioned
that <,> there is a demand <,> for the twenty-four hour border crossing

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#35:2:A>
A demand does not equal to a need

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#36:2:A>
Although there may be people voicing their opinions that they want
a twenty-four hour border crossing but this is not insufficient to establish
the necessity for this twenty-four hour <.> bording cro </.> border crossing

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#37:2:A>
And uhm a simple example <,> if you gave us statistics of how many
people are increasing <,> to uhm cross the border

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#38:2:A>
All these are is the same amount of people going to be crossing <,>
at uh let say five a m in the morning <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#39:2:A>
This is absurd

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#40:2:A>
And secondly uhm <,> they have mentioned about the economic cost
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#41:2:A>
As my captain has already mentioned <,> there are economic cost
problems <,> such as the infrastructure human resources and the cost
effectiveness <,> and uhm they mention that there is not there is not a need
for people to watch over the uhm to watch over uhm there is not a need to
increase the labor <,> if there  ' s a twenty-four hour border crossing

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#42:2:A>
For the very simple <.> ex </.> very simple example <,> uhm we need
people to watch <,> to check over illegal immigrants and is this not an
increase in labor and this not an increase in economic cost

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#43:2:A>
Because of today  ' s motion is that the twenty-four hour border
crossing would do more harm than good

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#44:2:A>
And one of the most obvious and concrete problems that we will face
is economic harms to Hong Kong as a whole

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#45:2:A>
There  ' re three main economic problems I  ' ll put forward to you
today

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#46:2:A>
Firstly <,> property prices <,> secondly <,> the intellectual
property factors <,> and finally the impact on the local retail business <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#47:2:A>
Uhm these are three crucial factors that will affect Hong Kong  ' s
<.> econom </.> economy as a whole <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#48:2:A>
Uh let me <,> let me make one thing clear first

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#49:2:A>
What this twenty-four hour border crossing does <,> is it it brings
in encouragement <,> of the mobility between Hong Kong and China

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#50:2:A>
It is telling you that it  ' s going to be more convenient <,> for
you to go to and fro Hong Kong and China

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#51:2:A>
And what does this do

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#52:2:A>
Problem one <,> the property prices

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#53:2:A>
They they mention themselves that land is cheap in China <,> but
then they said that because <,> there is uhm <.> techonolo </.> technological
advancements in Hong Kong <,> and this will still attract people to stay in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#54:2:A>
I believe if the land prices is cheap in China <,> then you will go
buy houses there <,> and technological advancements in Hong Kong will not be
tempting enough for it to keep you here

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#55:2:A>
And furthermore there are technological advancements in China as
well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#56:2:A>
So finally <,> what will happen is that people will purchase houses
in China and what this does to Hong Kong <,> is <?> it </?> decreases in
retail prices in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#57:2:A>
Let me remind you one of the main resource of income of Hong Kong
<,> and one of the main revenues of the Hong Kong government <,> is by land
sales

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#58:2:A>
And if our retail prices are going to drop <,> this is going to be
one <?> very important </?> factor that will affect Hong Kong  ' s economy as a
whole <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#59:2:A>
Secondly <,> the intellectual property factors <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#60:2:A>
We are aware that the intellectual property regulations in China is
insufficient <,> and if people are going to start buying houses in China <,>
and if people are start going to divert their base to China <,> what will
happen is there will be an encouragement of intellectual property
infringement

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#61:2:A>
And what does this do

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#62:2:A>
Uhm we can see the regulations of pirated CDs <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#63:2:A>
We can see regulations of censorships on books

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#64:2:A>
These these regulations are insufficient in China <,> and what we
are telling you <,> is that <,> this will be one of the most important
economic problems <,> uh that is the intellectual property infringement <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#65:2:A>
And finally <,> the local retail business

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#66:2:A>
This should be very obvious <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#67:2:A>
Things are cheap in China <,> and this twenty-four hour border
crossing <,> what it will do <,> is that it will it will destroy the local
retail business

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#68:2:A>
People have a tendency to buy these cheaper things <,> in China <,>
especially the shops that is near the border line

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#69:2:A>
And what does this do

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#70:2:A>
It is a greatly effects the local retail business <,> in Hong Kong
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#71:2:A>
As my captain has mentioned and as my following speaker will also
mention <,> Hong Kong is to keep its is to maintain its <.> competitives </.>
<,> competitiveness in in a world-wide basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#72:2:A>
And after the handover <,> we will promise we will promise autonomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#73:2:A>
And one of the most important autonomy <,> is the economic autonomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#74:2:A>
And what this twenty-four hour border crossing will do it is it
will it will infringe our competitiveness <,> within the economic factor <,>
and therefore we believe <,> that this twenty- four hour <.> pro </.> <,> uh
border crossing will do more harm than good <.> especiallies </.> especially
in economic terms

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#75:2:A>
What the negative side see is that there are certain demands for
the twenty-four hour border crossing

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#76:2:A>
For example some businessmen they found it more convenient <,> if
there is a twenty-four hour border crossing

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#77:2:A>
But what they are not seeing is that <,> there is insufficient need
for this twenty-four hour border crossing <,> and their their advantages do
not outweigh the harms that will happen <,> if this border crossing is to <,>
is to be implemented

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#78:2:A>
And what we are saying and what my speech has brought you <,> is
the most important harm that will affect Hong Kong <,> and that is economic
problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#79:2:A>
And this is one of the most obvious and concrete harms <,> that
will lead that will that will lead to problems <,> because of the twenty-four
hour border crossing <,> and that is why we believe <,> this motion should
stand

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#80:2:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-041#81:3:A>
Good afternoon <,> ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#82:3:A>
Before elaborating my <.> sp </.> my <.> sp </.> speech <,> I  ' d
like to do some rebuttal first <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#83:3:A>
The affirmative side suggested that <,> the the property prices
will decrease if this policy is <.> impl </.> implemented <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#84:3:A>
And the underlying assumption of them <,> is they equate the
equality of Hong Kong houses and the China houses

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#85:3:A>
And I would like to point out that <,> <.> Hon </.> when people try
to consider whether they choose to live in China or in Hong Kong <,> they
have many factors to <,> affect the decision <,> that is <,> the education
quality and also the <.> medicare </.> medical care quality

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#86:3:A>
The medical care quality and also education qualities in China is
not as best <.> a </.> <.> a </.> <.> a </.> as good as Hong Kong <,> and so
<,> many people will choose to stay in Hong Kong to live because all these
aspect

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#87:3:A>
And the second point it mention is about the crime rate

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#88:3:A>
They say that if this policy is <.> impl </.> implemented <,> more
crime rate will increase

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#89:3:A>
However they fail to give <,> to prove to give evidence to prove
the <.> dilec </.> direct link between the two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#90:3:A>
And the second and the third point it mention about the
intellectual infringement in China and back to Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#91:3:A>
But actually <,> the real case is <,> even in the daytime <,> these
is still occur because <,> not every <,> single travelers are checked by the
by the by the custom <,> and <,> so we think that <.> th </.> the argument is
cannot stand <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#92:3:A>
And now I  ' m going to further elaborate <,> the benefits brought by
this policy <,> in the economic prospect <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#93:3:A>
First of all our captain has emphasized at the very beginning

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#94:3:A>
After handover there is a <.> stron </.> stronger tie between Hong
Kong and China <,> and the globalization is the world trend

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#95:3:A>
After China enter the WTO <,> <?> that </?> we foresee that there
will be more interaction between China and Hong Kong <,> especially the Pearl
River Delta <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#96:3:A>
And <,> it is too narrow-minded to consider China as a competitor
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#97:3:A>
In order to boost our economy <,> we should consider China <,> as a
competitor <,> uh as a as a cooperator as a trading partner <,> and this can
achieve the win-win situation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#98:3:A>
The twenty-four hour border crossing policy <,> can facilitate the
increasing trading between Hong Kong <,> and China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#99:3:A>
In long term <,> Hong Kong can supply technicians <,> professionals
<,> investors for China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#100:3:A>
And also <,> on the other hand <,> China can supply cheap land and
also labor for Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#101:3:A>
We foresee that in the future <,> more people will be working in
China <,> and there will be more investment in China from Hong Kong <,> and
so there will be more travelers to go from China to Hong Kong or China or
Hong Kong to China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#102:3:A>
And this policy the twenty-four hours border crossing policy <,>
can bring a lot of convenience to these businessmen and working people <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#103:3:A>
They can save times because they do not have to <,> stay overnight
in China or in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#104:3:A>
In long term <,> this can facilitate the the increasing trading
<,> between the two region <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#105:3:A>
And the second <unc> one word </unc> benefits that can be
brought by this policy <,> is the boosting in tourism <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#106:3:A>
In the present time <,> the every year <,> there are seventy to
eighty billion people <,> going to China <,> and this trend is going to be
increasing in the future <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#107:3:A>
If this policy the twenty-four hour border crossing implements <,>
Hong Kong can acts as a middle-stop <,> for people who wants to go to China
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#108:3:A>
This can increase the flow of people and the travelers across Hong
Kong <,> and this can make a boost in the <.> ec </.> in the tourism in Hong
Kong <,> and this can bring a lot of revenues in hotel <,> industry <,>
retail industry and also food industry <,> and this can brought a lot of
revenues to Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#109:3:A>
So <,> today  ' s motion should not should not stand <,> because
Hong Kong can bring a lot of <,> that Hong Kong can receive a lot of benefits
from this policy

<ICE-HK:S2A-041#110:3:A>
Thank you </I>
