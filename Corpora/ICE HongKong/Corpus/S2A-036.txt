<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-036#1:1:A>
Right thank you chairman

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#2:1:A>
Uh good morning colleagues and the students

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#3:1:A>
Obviously I am very honoured to have accepted this opportunity to
say a few words on a topic uh given to me by the Dr David

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#4:1:A>
Uh the topic is called developing and supporting research at Poly U
pitfalls to avoid

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#5:1:A>
Uh in fact uhm I must confess that I haven't done my homework

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#6:1:A>
As professor <?> Cole </?> kind of uh uh suggested that students
should have uh some kind of training in terms of how to deal with people when
they go out to work and that includes uh be prepared present convince and
compromise

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#7:1:A>
So I haven't uh uh prepared much that  ' s why I  ' m not going to have
any slides or or projectors kind of uh <unc> one-word </unc> to show
you

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#8:1:A>
But uh I am trying to uh kind of share with you some of the books I
have and uh I am going to make a presentation of course but I am not going to
convince anyone uh let alone trying to compromise

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#9:1:A>
Uh anyway I think uhm my line of thought kind of stands from the
fact that uh when we talking about <,> trying to develop research uh
presumably in an academic institution then I think uhm my starting point will
be talking about research uh uh the definition of research meaning of
research and then the second uh question we will ask ourselves is that uh
what kind of culture we are going to develop in order to support research

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#10:1:A>
And I realize that uh two of the previous speakers have actually
looked into their dictionaries about the definition of research uh which I
haven't done

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#11:1:A>
As I said I haven't been able to uh uh spend more time than I wish
I should on this topic

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#12:1:A>
But I tend to adopt a definition which I have been adopting all
along is kind of my personal dictionary that uh I take research as meaning
something that it is a scholarly and intellectual activity aimed at advancing
the frontier of knowledge

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#13:1:A>
So that  ' s my definition of research

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#14:1:A>
And base on that then obviously we can identify two different types
of research which is kind of uh uh commonly uh uh used as kind of dichotomy
regarding the word research and that is basic versus applied research

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#15:1:A>
So in basic research I guess the emphasis is on the trying to get
some new knowledge just for the sake of knowing something new

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#16:1:A>
And then in applied research which is highly emphasized by the
professor <?> Cole </?> in his speech that uh that should be the uh uh uh
orientation uh as to be supported uh uh and to be adopted within the Hong
Kong environment is applied research where it is problem driven and that we
are trying to find a solution or trying to deal with some of the issues that
is connected with some problems we are facing

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#17:1:A>
And in the process of trying to get a solution then we have to do a
lot of activities trying to understand what the problem is trying to look
into past experiences as reported in the literature as how people kind of
went about solving those problems similar problems

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#18:1:A>
And then through our own creativity and through our own uh uh kind
of a training with different backgrounds that we try to come up with a
solution or trying to come up with a way to reduce the problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#19:1:A>
So that is problem driven in that sense and is applied

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#20:1:A>
So I think uh base on that and uh our next question is how are we
going to develop a culture that emphasizes research in an academic
institution

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#21:1:A>
And I presume that we  ' ll focus our discussion on how to develop a
research culture within the Polytechnic University which is a new university
just born about a few one uh a a few weeks ago

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#22:1:A>
Uh first of all I guess when we talk about culture and uh we would
invisibly uh uh mean that there is a group of persons involved because the
the the word culture is only meaningful when it is referring to a group of
people

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#23:1:A>
And then uh obviously if we talking about the Polytechnic
University and how to develop a research culture in this institution then
obviously we are referring to the staff as well as the students within the
institution

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#24:1:A>
How we are going to have a culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#25:1:A>
And uh according to my limited kind of a knowledge about uh this
word culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#26:1:A>
I guess I would define it as kind of a system of shared meaning
among a group of people

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#27:1:A>
So the this shared meaning obviously would reflect the norms the
philosophy that these people believe that the organization or the institution
holds or values

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#28:1:A>
And that because of that shared meaning that would drive their
behaviour and that is also reflected in the language in the symbol they use
uh in the <.> ru </.> rituals so to speak and all other aspects

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#29:1:A>
So the in order to have a culture uh which emphasizes research then
we have to do something about setting up such a system of shared values

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#30:1:A>
And uh in doing that I guess according to uh some established
theory in the uh cultural uh discipline or study in cultural uh development
we are talking about having a number of stages that got to be carried out in
order to eventually successfully uh install some kind of culture within an
organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#31:1:A>
So in our case within the Polytechnic University

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#32:1:A>
And uh the normal steps as espoused in the literature is that we
start out with some kind of uhm norms and philosophies which were advocated
or which were inherited from the founders or the fathers of organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#33:1:A>
So since we are a new university then we are in a kind of uh <.>
opportune </.> opportunity uh <.> oppotwin </.> uh uh a time to to to set our
culture in in the form of setting the norms and in the form of articulating
our philosophy as to what we mean by uh uh research as to what we uh how we
are going to attach the importance of value to this activity research as I
defined before

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#34:1:A>
And then the second step is what <?> we are think </?> an
organization uh is more or less reflected by the behaviour of its members

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#35:1:A>
So the very much I think whether we can sustain a culture depends
on what kind of people we have and that brings to the question of the
selection aspect

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#36:1:A>
So how are we going select our staff

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#37:1:A>
How are we going to select our students

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#38:1:A>
So obviously that would have a very crucial influence on whether or
not we can sustain the culture we wish to have or we set out to set up

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#39:1:A>
So I think if we are going to have a strong research culture then
obviously the the university will have to do something about the getting the
kind of right people in quotes

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#40:1:A>
Those who are sympathetic with our norms

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#41:1:A>
Those who are sympathetic with our philosophy and those who are
able to perform to what we expect them to perform at that level

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#42:1:A>
Similarly we have to do something in terms of getting the right
students so that they will become the ingredients the constituent components
of the organization and through their <?> productivity </?> behaviour that
reflects the culture of the organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#43:1:A>
And of course in order to execute those ideas to actually carry
through uh what we intended to do then we need a kind of uh support from top
management

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#44:1:A>
So the the supports we we typically think of includes those
tangible and intangible aspects

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#45:1:A>
So the tangible aspects include the kind of formal systems formal
uh incentive kind of uh systems we put in place to promote this culture ok

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#46:1:A>
So there might be uh a kind of a initiative procedures that might
be uh a reward systems uh put in place to reward people who act or behave
according to our norms

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#47:1:A>
And then always there would be as a kind of uh uh uh uh compliment
to the reward system there will be some kind of sanction so to speak that uh
there will be a self selection process for those who come in but turn out
that uh they actually cannot perform to this required level or they do not or
they fail to comply with the norms then they will have to find a way out or
they will be given a way out

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#48:1:A>
So that is kind of formal system we are talking about

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#49:1:A>
But the more important aspect again is that uh we need some kind of
intangible support from top management

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#50:1:A>
Uh that would be reflected in the way they behave themselves

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#51:1:A>
So the how much importance they attach to this research culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#52:1:A>
So there is not just kind of lip service

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#53:1:A>
They themselves should lead <unc> one-word </unc> example
that  ' s what I mean

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#54:1:A>
To set kind of uh being the role model for all the followers
including staff as well as students

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#55:1:A>
And then obviously the second uh kind of uh support I would ask for
in order to formalize this cultural <?> development </?> process would be the
socialization aspect

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#56:1:A>
So we got to let staff students and for that matter all members of
the organization to go through some kind of socialization process that would
reinforce this norm and philosophy through <.> reinform </.> uh reinforce the
shared meaning through all kinds of activities

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#57:1:A>
And uh I think uh in the end what we like to see is that there
would be <,> kind of benefits or incentives both intrinsic as well as
intrinsic extrinsic kind of uh activities or benefits to be derived from
members of the organization who <?> can </?> adhere to this culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#58:1:A>
So what I mean by the uh uh intrinsic kind of a benefit would
include uh some kind of uh <?> development </?> uh to the staff that once
they have the experience of uhm tasting the success of <,> doing something
valuable through their research activities then they got tremendous
succession

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#59:1:A>
Uh to the extent that they forgot that they haven't visited a
barber shop for a long time and that might be the kind of uh environment we
wish to instill in <?> our </?> organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#60:1:A>
And that just reminded me that I haven't visited a barber shop for
two months and tomorrow might be a good time visit ShenZhen

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#61:1:A>
And uh I guess this speaks for <unc> one- word </unc> again
my personal opinion as how we should go about if we choose to develop a
strong research culture in the Polytechnic University

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#62:1:A>
And finally I guess uh I would mention a number of pitfalls uh uh
that uh might arise in the process of doing that

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#63:1:A>
I think uh when we talk about culture then obviously we can
classify a culture as to whether it is a strong culture or a weak culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#64:1:A>
Uh by strong culture I mean that most of the members of the
organization share that meaning and that they are <?> intensely </?> adhered
to it

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#65:1:A>
So that is called a strong culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#66:1:A>
And there are good aspects as well as bad aspects associated with a
strong culture

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#67:1:A>
And obviously the good things about having a good or strong culture
is that uh there will be consistency in behaviour so that things will be easy
to control and that everyone will do that without much kind of uh uh uh uh uh
guidance or much uh uh threat from senior people or people or members at the
senior level of the organization

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#68:1:A>
But uh if the culture is too strong then uh it might be too or all
members might be too entrenched in that culture at the expense of kind of a
losing sight of what is going on in the outside world

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#69:1:A>
So I think uhm we wish to develop a culture which would value which
would give emphasis to research because out of all uh Sir Doctor Lee in
mention in his speech that uh two of the primary functions of the institution
of high education would be teaching and research

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#70:1:A>
So if we do uh if we don't do research uh up to the required level
then we should not deserve the title of a university okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#71:1:A>
But if we overdo it then obviously we might uh do it at the expense
of teaching and uh that certainly would uh also uh jeopardize our uh uh uh
<.> abi </.> ability to to to achieve our mission that uh we wish to do both
well and at a <?> acceptable </?> level

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#72:1:A>
So I guess uh <&> unclear words due to interruption from another
speaker </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#73:1:A>
Within a second I guess

<ICE-HK:S2A-036#74:1:A>
I I guess that  ' s all I wish to say </I>
