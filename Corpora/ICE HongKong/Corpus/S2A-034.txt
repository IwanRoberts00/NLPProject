<ICE-HK:S2A-034#56:3:A>
Honourable adjudicators Ms chairlady ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#57:3:A>
Today the motion is the American style committee system should be
introduced into the Legislative Council of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#58:3:A>
I will define the motion for you in two parts

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#59:3:A>
In the first part I would explain what is the American style
committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#60:3:A>
And in the second part we will show you why this system should be
introduced into the Legislative Council of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#61:3:A>
Firstly we realize there is a common misunderstanding of what the
American style committee system is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#62:3:A>
Many people misunderstood that the American style committee system
includes two powers of the power to initiation of bills and the power to kill
bills <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#63:3:A>
As a result these people become very worried because if these two
powers were introduced into our Legco then this may change the current
political system of an <?> Ex-centered led </?> government into a Legislative
<?> led one </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#64:3:A>
However this is only a misunderstanding <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#65:3:A>
In actuality these two powers of the initiation <?> of </?> bills
and the killing of bills they are granted by the American congressional
system and not the committee system we are discussing here tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#66:3:A>
If when I say if we have to include these two powers in tonight  ' s
<.> demate </.> debate then I  ' m afraid that we have to change the notion
entirely to whether the American congressional system should be introduced
into the Legislative Council of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#67:3:A>
Well in that case it is impractical because it is impractical to
transplant the entire American Congress into Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#68:3:A>
It is impractical and impossible

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#69:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we think we want and we want to treat and
address today  ' s motion very accurately

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#70:3:A>
That is why we believe it is an important task for us to uh
eliminate and to correct these common misunderstanding of those people in the
first hand <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#71:3:A>
Now that we know those two powers they do not come from the
committee system but the congressional system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#72:3:A>
And now let me show you what this American style committee system
is all about <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#73:3:A>
The American style committee system is referring to as that of
specialized standing committee formed within the legislature that asserts the
whole legislature is supervising bills and supervising policies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#74:3:A>
These specialized committees have four characteristics

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#75:3:A>
First they are <?> permanent </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#76:3:A>
Second they have formal structure

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#77:3:A>
Third they have a long standing style

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#78:3:A>
And fourth they are open to the public

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#79:3:A>
Because they are permanent members can stay on the committee and
devote expertise <?> within </?> their jurisdiction

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#80:3:A>
Because they are formal structured and <?> have </?> long standing
style then the legislative process will become more efficient in uh well in
terms of uh of money and time and resources

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#81:3:A>
And because they are open to the public with public hearing it
would strengthen the government  ' s accountability to the Legislature

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#82:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen <unc> several-words </unc> we really
see that the American style committee system can bring to the whole
legislature the merits of expertise efficiency and accountability

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#83:3:A>
Now we come to the second part of the motion and that is this type
of committee system introduced into our Legislature

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#84:3:A>
First of all what do we see in our Legislative Council now

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#85:3:A>
Number one lack of expertise <unc> 2-words </unc> the bill

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#86:3:A>
Number two <unc> 2-words </unc> degree of efficiency

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#87:3:A>
And <?> number </?> three it is not open to the public and the
monetary role is not strong enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#88:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen by introducing this style this American style
committee system into Legco it would bring <?> along </?> efficiency and
expertise as explained by my first speaker later

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#89:3:A>
It <?> would </?> also strengthen the monetary role of uhm
government uhm to Legco and this will be further elaborated by my second
speaker <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#90:3:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we want <?> a </?> more efficient and
effective Legislature in checking the government as promised in the Basic Law
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#91:3:A>
By introducing this type of committee system into our Legislative
Council we shall have more higher quality bills made for the real interest
and well being of us all

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#92:3:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-034#93:4:A>
After listening to her speech

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#94:4:A>
Let  ' s have the captain of the negative side Mr Desmond Chow to
make his response </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-034#95:5:A>
Good evening madam chairman ladies and gentlemen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#96:5:A>
Now the proposition today is trying to hard sell the proposal that
is the adoption of the American committee style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#97:5:A>
I believe the proposition side are <unc> 1-word </unc> very
good salesmen but they can even sell the refrigerators to the Eskimos

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#98:5:A>
But ladies and gentlemen we are not <.> e b </.> we are not easy to
be deceived

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#99:5:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we are clever customers

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#100:5:A>
They just bring out the pseudo American style committee system
without telling us what is the real

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#101:5:A>
Ladies and gentlemen we want the real American style committee
system <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#102:5:A>
In fact the proposition said many people misunderstand the
American style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#103:5:A>
That is not true

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#104:5:A>
It is indeed their own misunderstanding of what it is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#105:5:A>
Ladies and gentlemen to achieve to examine the motion we must look
at what the American style committee is by examining the essence of the
system itself

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#106:5:A>
So what is the essence of the system we have to look at both the
structure and the power vested within the structure

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#107:5:A>
First the structure

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#108:5:A>
Ladies and gentlemen look at the American Congress

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#109:5:A>
There are over three hundred members in the American Congress who
are full time politicians directly elected by the people

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#110:5:A>
What about Hong Kong Legco

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#111:5:A>
We have only sixty members <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#112:5:A>
<.> Mer </.> Most of whom are not are just part time politicians
and they are not most of them are not directly elected

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#113:5:A>
So how can the proposition ensure that this <.> suc </.> this
system can work in Hong Kong as it does in America with such vast differences
in the structural characteristics between Hong Kong and the United States

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#114:5:A>
Also power now ladies and gentlemen <,> power is important because
whether the structure works depends on whether a certain degree of power is
vested within the structure

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#115:5:A>
And it is indeed power is indeed a part and partial element of the
whole package which is indispensable ladies and gentlemen which is
indispensable

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#116:5:A>
Otherwise this is not an American system without that particular
part and they said indeed our team is not unprepared for this debate

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#117:5:A>
We have <?> we have searched </?> in many books and all these
books tell us that the structure the American committees do have the power to
initiate bills of all kinds ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#118:5:A>
And we the opposition side contends that by having such power in
the Legco committees the problem is it violates the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#119:5:A>
This is the reality which the proposition <.> sh </.> should see

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#120:5:A>
Look at article seventy four of the Basic Law it says that matters
of the Legco cannot <,> uh can initiate bills only with the consent of the
chief executive with matters concerning the <?> operation in </?> government
structure operation in government structure political system as well as the
public expenditure

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#121:5:A>
So ladies and gentlemen we want we the opposition side want a
smooth transition and I see I hope the proposition side will agree with us
that a stable evolution is necessary

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#122:5:A>
That is any arrangement within the Legco should not violate the
Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#123:5:A>
And we believe if a real American style committee system is
adopted into the Legco then the Basic Law will surely be violated

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#124:5:A>
Indeed we the opposition side <?> contends </?> that <.> th </.>
our present system is doing a good job

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#125:5:A>
It  ' s doing certain functions which are being done by the American
committees

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#126:5:A>
For example <,> the uh Hong Kong Legco can initiate and amend
bills and the <.> Hon </.> there are three standing committees in <?> fact
</?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#127:5:A>
For example the <unc> 1-word </unc> committee which can
reject budgets presented from the Executive Council and the OMELCO panels
which will be <.> recei </.> which will be renamed as the Legco panels will
serve as correspondents to each executive branch of the government

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#128:5:A>
Also there are all other formal channels supplementing the
functions of the Legislative Council as well as other informal channels of
other informal channels through which the Executive can be checked <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#129:5:A>
Now ladies and gentlemen the proposition side has come up with a
very very wrong analogy

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#130:5:A>
They try to equate accountability of the government with the
adoption of the American style committee system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#131:5:A>
What a strange analogy <.> ri </.>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#132:5:A>
What a strange analogy

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#133:5:A>
Now ladies and gentlemen if they pursue the idea of accountability
they should in fact start with how many seats in the Legco itself should be
directly elected and not to adopt the American <.> sty </.> style committee
system

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#134:5:A>
Please the proposition tell us the analogy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#135:5:A>
Ladies and gentlemen I rest my case

<ICE-HK:S2A-034#136:5:A>
Thank you </I>
