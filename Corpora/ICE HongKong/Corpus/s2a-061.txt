<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-061#1:1:A>
There is only one issue for you to consider <,> and that is the
question of consent <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#2:1:A>
At the end of the day you have to ask <,> yourself whether Madam Ho
consented to the conduct <,,> of the defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#3:1:A>
A lot of the crown  ' s evidence is not being kept <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#4:1:A>
Take for example <,> there was no challenge as regard to forensic
evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#5:1:A>
There is no challenge of contact evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#6:1:A>
There is no challenge <,> that the defendant <,> did more or less
<,> the things described by Madam Ho <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#7:1:A>
What is in issue is <,> whether there was consent <,> on the part of
Madam Ho <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#8:1:A>
And this is a question of fact which you have to consider <,> having
heard all the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#9:1:A>
Now members of the jury I told you <,> when I opened the case to you
not too long ago <,> that you are the sole judges of the facts of this trial
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#10:1:A>
Ultimately <,> you will be the one who have to discharge the
responsibility <,> of deciding whether or not the defendant is guilty or not
guilty of the charge of attempted rape <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#11:1:A>
Now when you have to resolve matters of fact <,> I have to urge you
to use your common sense <,> and your experience of life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#12:1:A>
Don't venture into the realms of fantasies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#13:1:A>
After all <,> this is not a fantasy world <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#14:1:A>
This is a world of reality <,,> a world where you have to <.> dis
</.> on the evidence <?> as viewed </?> who which is the correct <,,> which
are the facts <,> that you can believe and accept <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#15:1:A>
And therefore <,> it is so necessary for you to exercise your
common sense <,> and your experience in life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#16:1:A>
And of course in so doing you have got to have regard to the
demeanour of the witnesses <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#17:1:A>
And in this particular case <,> all you have to decide is to to
have regard on the demeanour of Madam Ho while she was giving evidence <,>
and the demeanour of the defendant while he was giving evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#18:1:A>
The rest of the witnesses the police officers <,> the doctors <,>
the forensic scientists

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#19:1:A>
Their evidence is not challenged in the <unc> 1-word </unc>
so you can accept their evidence <,> if you of course feel that they are
reliable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#20:1:A>
Now as I say <,> the only pertinant issue is the question of
consent <,,> and you have two versions <,> which are diametrically opposed
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#21:1:A>
Now I venture to suggest to you <,> Madam Ho was telling you the
true story <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#22:1:A>
She was telling you the true version of what occurred

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#23:1:A>
Now you ask yourself <,> why did Madam Ho have to fabricate <,> an
untrue story <,> against the defendant <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#24:1:A>
They were strangers <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#25:1:A>
They had no <?> match </?> against each other <,> before the
twenty-seventh of February <?> of </?> nineteen ninety-two <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#26:1:A>
Her story <,> was one of attempted rape <,> and according to her
<,> the rape took place inside his car <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#27:1:A>
Now even if you if she was to <,> fabricate a story <,> against the
defendant <,> the story could have stopped <,,> on the events inside the car
inside the car <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#28:1:A>
She was the defendant was attempting to rape her <,> remove her
trousers worn by her <,> laid on her <,> without her consent <,> and then
ejaculated <,> before he haven't before he ever penetrated her <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#29:1:A>
The story could have stopped at that <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#30:1:A>
Why was it necessary for her <,> to go on <,> to fabricate a
further story <,> of being humiliated or being subjected to the humiliation
<,> of being taken by the defendant for a short ride <,> going to the beach
<,> in her underpants <,> told to crawl <,> underneath the lorry <,,> and
then throw her <,> trousers away <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#31:1:A>
You will recall <,> she said that when that she was frightened <,>
after the defendant had gone <,> she crawl out from the underneath of the
lorry <,> got back her trousers <,> put them on and then walked home <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#32:1:A>
Why was it necessary to fabricate this second <unc> 1-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#33:1:A>
Ask yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#34:1:A>
There was no reason whatsoever <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#35:1:A>
Now another thing you have to consider <,> members of the jury if I
may suggest to you ask yourself <,> what possible motive <,> did Madam Ho
have <,> to fabricate <,> this story against the defendant <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#36:1:A>
For what <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#37:1:A>
For five hundred dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#38:1:A>
For a merely five hundred dollars <,> which would obviously <,>
involve alarming her husband <,> to this event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#39:1:A>
Of course you are all men of the world

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#40:1:A>
Imagine yourself <,> if you are married what would you think what
would you feel if your wife were to come home one day and tell you <,>
somebody attempted to rape me

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#41:1:A>
Would a wife <,> tell a false story like that <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#42:1:A>
And that  ' s not all

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#43:1:A>
And it  ' s all for five hundred dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#44:1:A>
It has been suggested <,> by the Defence <,> that Madam Ho was in
financial difficulties

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#45:1:A>
You have heard the evidence of Madam Ho

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#46:1:A>
She deny this <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#47:1:A>
She was earning something in the region of eight thousand to ten
thousand dollars even more than what the defendant was earning <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#48:1:A>
And you have heard <,> that her husband was <,> making something
like seven thousand dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#49:1:A>
They between themselves they had a simple family <,> one young son
<,> and between themselves they had something like in the region of seventeen
to eighteen thousand dollars <?> a month </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#50:1:A>
Use your common sense <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#51:1:A>
Why <,> why <unc> 1-utterance </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#52:1:A>
But that is not at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#53:1:A>
In order to make this report you will remember she had to go
through the ordeal <,> of being physically examined <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#54:1:A>
You have seen the photographs <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#55:1:A>
She was photographs of her injuries were taken <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#56:1:A>
She was medically examined <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#57:1:A>
Body fluids were taken from her <,> <unc> several-words
</unc> <?> were taken </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#58:1:A>
Use your common sense <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#59:1:A>
Any woman <,> whatever her character <,> would find that <?> as a
warning </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#60:1:A>
It was definitely <,> not a pleasant thing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#61:1:A>
And that is not all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#62:1:A>
The worst is that she had to come here to tell <,> you or all the
world this false story <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#63:1:A>
An attempted rape of force attempted rape of which she was the
victim <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#64:1:A>
Now ask yourself <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#65:1:A>
It does not <?> stand on </?> common sense <,> to tell a story <?>
like that </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#66:1:A>
She might not be a very educated person <,> nor very sophisticated
you might think <,> but <,> judge her for yourself <?> all she can do </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#67:1:A>
What was the motive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#68:1:A>
Was it worthwhile to do it <,> to go all the way <,,> as she <,>
has done <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#69:1:A>
And I submit to you <,> no woman in her proper senses would have
done such a thing <,> would have fabricated this story <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#70:1:A>
Now whereas on the other hand <,> I can't say the same for the
defendant <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#71:1:A>
The defendant had every motive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#72:1:A>
He lied to you to go into the witness box <,> to give this story
this story <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#73:1:A>
You will remember <,,> his pager machine <,> was found <.> mis </.>
missing <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#74:1:A>
So the immediate immediate reaction <,> by anyone <,> it must have
been picked up by Madam Ho <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#75:1:A>
And once that has been picked up <,> his identity will be <?>
proved </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#76:1:A>
He will be identified <,,> and the day will come when the police
will knock <,> on his door

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#77:1:A>
You will hear that he said in the witness box <,> that he gave a
true address when applying for the machine <,> the pager machine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#78:1:A>
So <,> eventually he knew <,> that this is going his identity was
going to <?> be found </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#79:1:A>
And that is why he went to the police himself <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#80:1:A>
And he has also told <,> told you in the witness box <,> he thought
that <,> if he would make the report after Madam Ho <,> did <,> then it would
be more difficult <,> for him to explain to the police

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#81:1:A>
You may ask for yourself why why was it more difficult

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#82:1:A>
The truth is the truth <,> whatever way you look at it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#83:1:A>
If you are telling the truth whether you tell it now you tell it
two days later two weeks later or two years later it  ' s still the truth <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#84:1:A>
Why <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#85:1:A>
Because I suggest to you he thought that there was a peccable
advantage <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#86:1:A>
And that  ' s <,> that is why he went to the police <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#87:1:A>
And another thing I wish to put forward for your consideration is
about this conversation in the car <,,> asking about each other  ' s job <,>
asking about hobbies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#88:1:A>
Now all this it  ' s very easy to make up a story like this <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#89:1:A>
Mind you <,> it  ' s never difficult for the defendant to find out
<,,> the job of Madam Ho because Madam Ho gives evidence in the witness box
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#90:1:A>
So the story could be made up just like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#91:1:A>
The story could have been made up as the trial goes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#92:1:A>
And then there is this sexual transaction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#93:1:A>
With the greatest respect <,> this is insulting <,> to your
intelligence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#94:1:A>
Would you think it probable <,> that the sex transaction could have
taken place <,> <?> could have suggested under this circumstances </?> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#95:1:A>
He was talking about <,> the agreed sum of five hundred dollars
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#96:1:A>
He was telling he had you believe he wanted you to believe he had
every intention to pay five hundred dollars <,,> but when I pressed him
whether he had the money <,> he started to <.> prevar </.> prevaricate <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#97:1:A>
He even talked asked me whether I was talking about his money in
the bank <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#98:1:A>
He knew <?> he </?> wasn't <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#99:1:A>
Would anyone <,> if there was any truth <,> in the defendant  ' s
story <,> have promised to pay if I may say so a prostitute what he
considered to be a prostitute <,> five hundred dollars <,> which he <,,> did
not have the money to pay at all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#100:1:A>
Mind you <,> before he tried <,> he had no idea that he was not
going to make it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#101:1:A>
He has <.> al </.> he has told you that he had his sexual <?>
urges </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#102:1:A>
Just <?> the </?> mention of a woman whom <,> he never had a good
look <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#103:1:A>
He never had a look <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#104:1:A>
He had a look at her face <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#105:1:A>
He knew nothing about her <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#106:1:A>
Is that possible <,> members of the jury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#107:1:A>
Ask yourself <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#108:1:A>
To believe his story <,> is to build castles in the air <,> if I
may say so <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#109:1:A>
And of course <,> in judging <,> the proof or otherwise of what uh
someone is saying in the witness box of course you have as I say <,> the
regard to his or her demeanour <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#110:1:A>
But at the same time you would also have to judge carefully <,>
the way in which he or she answers questions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#111:1:A>
Now let me <,> mention to you <,> two single instances <,> while
while they  ' re fresh in your mind <,> where the defendant was convinced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#112:1:A>
You will remember <,,> I asked him <,> whether he was afraid <,>
of being discovered <,> whether he was afraid of of having his identity
discovered once he found that his pager was missing

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#113:1:A>
I had to ask few times <,> and that question was never answered
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#114:1:A>
And again <,> I asked him whether he thought that it was
advantageous for him to make a report before Madam Ho did <,> and again he
prevaricated <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#115:1:A>
No doubt members of the jury <,> you will <,> judge this for
yourselves

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#116:1:A>
Of course what I I  ' m saying to you is my suggestion <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#117:1:A>
It  ' s my suggestion with the intention of trying to help <,> but
of course if you disagree with with me then no doubt you draw you own
conclusions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#118:1:A>
Now members of the jury on the consideration of the whole of the
evidence before <unc> 1-word </unc> <,,> I think your verdict <,> can
only be one of guilty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#119:1:A>
Thank you <?> very much </?> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-061#120:2:A>
Members of the jury the uh issue is the one of consent <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#121:2:A>
There is no dispute as you uh would have gathered uh from evidence
that uh the uh the defendant does not dispute that he <,> and Madam Ho
engaged in acts <,> uh preparatory to sexual intercourse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#122:2:A>
But the defendant of course said that he uhm during the the act
ejaculated prematurely <,> uhm and therefore uh a lot of uh other evidence in
this case <,> uh that as you would see not in dispute <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#123:2:A>
For instance there  ' s no dispute the defendant was the owner of
pager <,> that he worked the nightshift as a taxi driver and shared the shift
with a friend

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#124:2:A>
Uh as as you uh could uh remember uh <,> not much dispute about uh
the scientific evidence <,> uh which uh the Prosecution uh elicited in order
I assume to prove that uh the defendant and Madam Ho engaged in certain acts
inside the taxi <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#125:2:A>
That again is not in dispute <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#126:2:A>
And it is right that uh members of the jury uh that the issue is
one of consent <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#127:2:A>
Now in in a case like this uh members of the jury <,> it  ' s very
important uh to look for what is in law called uh corroboration <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#128:2:A>
Now corroboration is really uh supporting evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#129:2:A>
The the the meaning of it uh is <unc> several-words </unc>
and probably on Monday <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#130:2:A>
But perhaps you you would uh uh like to hear now that uh in cases
like this it  ' s very important to look for corroboration <,> which uh really
means uh supporting evidence <,> which implicates the defendant in the
commission of the crime <,> and it must be independent evidence <,> meaning
that uh it is uh evidence which has not come from uh the alleged uh victim
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#131:2:A>
In other words we would look in this sort of case to whether there
are other evidence <,> which indicate that the defendant had committed the
crime <,> which evidence does not come form Madam Ho <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#132:2:A>
Now the <,,> the importance of this uh is is of course uh the
danger that a witness may have been motivated by fantasy <,> by neurosis <,>
by jealousy <,> by spite <,> or has consented to the sexual uh intercourse or
<unc> 1-or-2-words </unc> preparatory sexual intercourse but is too
ashamed or embarrassed to admit it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#133:2:A>
And the law members of the jury that the uh the jury must
dispassionately analyse uh the accuracy of the uh victim  ' s uh evidence in in
this sort of case <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#134:2:A>
And you will hear in due course from his Lordship that that it
would be dangerous <,> in this case to convict the uh defendant without
corroboration <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#135:2:A>
Now members of the jury there is in fact no corroboration in this
case

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#136:2:A>
The evidence <,> uh implicating the defendant comes only <,> from
uh from uh Madam Ho <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#137:2:A>
And therefore it  ' s very important we should look very carefully
at the evidence of Madam Ho <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#138:2:A>
Now it is true that as you might have heard that there are some
injuries on Madam Ho <,> but that matter as as you will uh uh see uh uh <?>
are uh </?> consistent with the defendant  ' s case that he has engaged uh in
the struggle or scuffle <,> uh uh with the defendant <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#139:2:A>
And therefore injuries uh on Madam Ho is not supporting evidence
nor uh corroboration <,> uh in this case <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#140:2:A>
Now the Defence  ' s case is that Madam Ho for some reason made up
uh her allegations against the defendant <,> and uh you  ' ll hear that uh <,>
you you have heard that the the evidence that that she complained to her <.>
hus </.> to her husband uh does not uh refute that <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-061#141:2:A>
The fact of a a complaint to her husband again is not uh
corroboration in this case </I>
