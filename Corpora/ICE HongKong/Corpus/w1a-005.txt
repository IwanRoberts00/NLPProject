<h> <ul> PREFACE </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#2:1>
<p> It is absurd to deny or accept the heading statement without defining the
meaning and providing the scope for this topic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#3:1>
There are three preconditions we need to grasp according to the
problem meaning and scope .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#4:1>
First , it requires our understanding on a democratic political system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#5:1>
In this regard , many will refer the western type political system as
democratic one or Joseph A. Schumpeter  ' s definition as desirable one .
<fnr> &obrack; l &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#6:1>
Those inferences are not without ground .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#7:1>
In the western culture , there lives a fundamental belief that man is
superior for man has free will .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#8:1>
When all other species are disciplined by the natural order , man can
break such cocoon and be free .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#9:1>
Thus , freedom is an unavoidable essence for human existence .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#10:1>
When this is grounded , the political sphere becomes an arena
protecting human freedom .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#11:1>
And in order to protect everyone  ' s freedom , democracy is an
unavoidable concept . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#12:1>
<p> It can be understood as that division of power is an indivisible part in
politics .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#13:1>
If the power is not well-defined or not <-> well-devided </-> <+>
well divided </+> , those have greater power will intrude or influence others  ' 
action .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#14:1>
As a result , freedom is challenged .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#15:1>
Thus , democracy plays a crucial role in the political system by
which the main essence of democracy is the , respect of human right and
equality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#16:1>
Here , Joseph A. Schumpeter supplies a desirable and concrete
definition on democratic political system which refers to the extent that the
political system  ' s most powerful collective decision-makers are selected
through periodic elections in which candidates freely compete fare votes and
in which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#17:1>
This system will be adopted as the model serving for the analysis of
the topic statement .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#18:1>
<p> Second , it is assumed that we all get a common set of preconditions for
democratization and basically , we all believe that for democratization ,
there must be preconditions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#19:1>
In order to avoid the mistake of swinging entirely to an extreme of
ignoring the environmental factors that may affect democratic development ,
we all accept the latter viewpoint .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#20:1>
However , there have been a wide variety of factors or preconditions
being suggested , such as the economic , Social , cultural , psychological
and external factors , only two commonly discussed preconditions will be
selected &longdash; the political and economic ones . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#21:1>
<p> According to the democratic model , it is found that if a periodical and
open election system is to established , it is necessary that there is a
widely differentiated and articulated social structure with relatively
autonomous social classes , regional groups , occupational groups , and
ethnic and religious groups .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#22:1>
As Huntington argues , the existence of these groups provide the
basis for the limitation of state power , hence for the control of the state
by society , and hence for democratic political institutions as the most
effective means of exercising that control . <fnr> &obrack; 2 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#23:1>
However , it is also believed that these groups must be politically
awared and equally competed , otherwise , there may only be fragmented
outlook or concentrated power in the face of political system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#24:1>
If this political factor is the lacking precondition in Hong Kong ,
it is asserted that Hong Kong lack a well-educated and autonomous social
structure &semi; and there is no political awareness and equally competed
groups .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#25:1>
Whether this is the case will be further investigated . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#26:1>
<p> Furthermore , economic <-> weath </-> <+> wealth </+> is believed to be
another <-> Iactor </-> <+> factor </+> that influence the possibility of
establishing a democratic political system for there is one Chinese saying
telling that there is a sense of insult and honor only if there is no cold
and hunger <O> Chinese-characters </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#27:1>
Lipset also highlights the seeming correlation between high levels of
economic development and the prevalence of democratic political systems among
European , English-speaking and Latin American nations .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#28:1>
A comparison done by the World Bank and Freedom House in 1981 showed
the evidence that two of thirty-six low-income countries were classified
&ldquo; free &rdquo; or democratic , fourteen out of sixty middle-income
countries were so classified , and eighteen out of twenty-four countries with
industrial economies were so classified . <fnr> &obrack; 3 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#29:1>
And as this relationship is advocated , there are a lot of works
evaluating whether Hong Kong is wealthy enough to promote democratic ideas ,
especially in this critical period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#30:1>
If it is asserted that Hong Kong lacks democratic preconditions ,
lacking economic conditions may be one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#31:1>
However , whether this analysis is valid will be called for attention
later . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#32:1>
<p> A last point will be reminded here serving as the footnote for this
attempt .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#33:1>
As everyone accepts the premise that democratization requires certain
preconditions , it is easy for one to fall into a trap for jumping from the
correlation <-> bewteen </-> <+> between </+> democracy and other factors to
the conclusion that those other factors are responsible for democracy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#34:1>
Many may think that if preconditions exist , then democratization
must be the final outcome .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#35:1>
The attempt here will only be a work evaluating the existence of
democratic preconditions but not the guessing of democratization possibility
in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#36:1>
The latter work requires a political scientist or an economist or may
be a fortune teller which is out of the ability here .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#37:1>
Furthermore , this part of work is only meaningful by giving us a
probable timing on when this political system will exist .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#38:1>
However , again , this piece of work is out of our discussion context
here . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#39:1>
<h> <ul> THE EXISTENCE OF PRECONDITIONS </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#40:1>
<p> As mentioned , those preconditions usually taken by people to make an
evaluation are both political and economic ones .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#41:1>
Thus , this part will mainly concern these aspects .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#42:1>
As a point of departure , it is mentioned that no one precondition
described is sufficient to lead to democratic development .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#43:1>
And even within the political or economic factor , there may not be
all supportive or hindering elements .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#44:1>
Just like a multdimensional diamond , the relationship between the
elements or factors are complicated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#45:1>
Furthermore , no one will blindly use the same measurement to measure
all contexts without noticing the specific context  ' s uniqueness .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#46:1>
And among all uniqueness , it must be known that Hong Kong has a
crucial political factor for her sovereignty will be returned to China in a
flash .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#47:1>
It is absurd to underlook this factor . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#48:1>
<h> &obrack; 1 &cbrack; <ul> Political Precondition </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#49:1>
<p> When we refer the political precondition mentioned before , it seems that
two areas have to be noted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#50:1>
They are &obrack; a &cbrack; the existence or potential of existence
of a group of educated , autonomous , politically awarded and equally
competed bourgeoisie who can form a hierarchy of leadership providing the
basis for the limitation of state power or the monitor government power .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#51:1>
<p> &obrack; b &cbrack; the readiness or potential of readiness of an open
political system in which the most powerful decision-maker(s &cbrack; is elected or
dismissed through the collective votings of the public &semi; and in which
every adult has the right to be elected . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#52:1>
<p> If it is asserted that Hong Kong lacks The preconditions for <->
dimocratization </-> <+> democratization </+> , it is believed that Hong Kong
is entirely lacking the above two areas .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#53:1>
However , there are conservations .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#54:1>
When we take a brief glance on the political scenario of Hong Kong
government slightly before , we are not difficult to have an impression that
the political structure of Hong Kong was dim .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#55:1>
Those <-> elities </-> <+> elites </+> were mainly appointed by the
Governor or the Queen .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#56:1>
The deficiency of this picture was that these political actors were
dependent on the-bureaucracy for maintaining their privileges , hence they
might primarily work up the initiative of the bureaucracy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#57:1>
Accordingly , the readiness of an open political system was hard to
exist . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#58:1>
<p> On the other hand , common people were largely seen as subjects who were
indifferent to collective decision taking as long as its results were not
detrimental enough to attack their interests .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#59:1>
There was an overall atmosphere of aloofness , avoidance of
involvement with outsiders and low social participation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#60:1>
They were ignorant to demand changes and participation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#61:1>
Their means of ventilation might only be making small riots or going
to youth centers , not to mention the awareness of political participation
nor the formation of political parties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#62:1>
Even pressure groups were very weak and , with the exception of
business interests , largely ignored .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#63:1>
The only development towards representative government was the
establishment in 1982 of elected district boards which provided a forum for
the low-level political debate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#64:1>
In this regard , if the assertion of Hong Kong lacking democratic
preconditions refers to this specific time , it may be valid . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#65:1>
<p> However , the stated aloofness of people  ' s political attitude had been
altered by three crucial factors during and after Sino-British Agreement on
1997 issue .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#66:1>
First , the negotiations brought home to Hong Kong people the fact
that their futures were being discussed by foreign governments who were
reaching decisions on which the local population had very little say by which
this would result in dissatisfactions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#67:1>
At a few moments during the negotiations there almost seemed to be
potential for social unrest . <fnr> &obrack; 4 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#68:1>
The publication of the agreement accelerated the growth of
organizations designed <-> toprotect </-> <+> to protect </+> the interests
of local people and required every citizen to take stock of his or her future .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#69:1>
In this perspective , the 1997 issue seems having dramatic effect on
people  ' s political consciousness . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#70:1>
<p> Second , many feared that 1997 would simply mean direct rule by the
communist China which would mean authoritarian rule .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#71:1>
Mistrust of Chinese intentions runs deep in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#72:1>
Approximately 37&percent; of the population were born in China and came to
Hong Kong as political refugees in search of better <-> economec </-> <+>
economic </+> opportunities . <fnr> &obrack; 5 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#73:1>
This fear was especially popular among the rapid rise middle class in
the 1980s .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#74:1>
This propertied middle class suddenly saw its affluence and property
threatened by the transfer of power .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#75:1>
There emerged a constellation of occupational and functional groups
&longdash; most or them led and supported by the middle class &longdash;
which sought to improve their specific situations in the period before 1997
for these group leaders believed they were in a zero sum game , that if they
did not win support for their demands in the transitional period , then they
would never do so .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#76:1>
Moreover , one of the new political arrangements , introduced in
September 1985 , was to provide for functional constituencies in the
legislature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#77:1>
&obrack; b &cbrack; This had the immediate effect of entrenching ,
legitimising and supplying a public forum for those functional areas and
interest groups fortunate enough to win representation . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#78:1>
<p> Third , the weakness of the Hong Kong government in the post-agreement
period and proposed changes to the political structure , particularly the
issue of direct elections , gave further impetus to the growth of political
consciousness and provided an incentive for increasing the organizational
strength and efficiency of pressure groups .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#79:1>
For example , Report of the Assessment Office reviewed that only 2494
responses were received towards the Views on the acceptability of the <->
agrement </-> <+> agreement </+> and many of those were from pressure groups
or commercial or traditional organizations who were expected to respond but
from which , many respondents were opposed ones . <fnr> &obrack; 7 &cbrack;
</fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#80:1>
<p> <-> Coresponding </-> <+> Corresponding </+> to the two political areas ,
it seems that there is increasing political awareness among people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#81:1>
And the rise of middle class is autonomous and well-educated enough
to form as political leaders to limit government power and demand
participation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#82:1>
On the other hand , the picture within the political scenario is the
declining governability and eroding legitimation of existing Hong Kong
government which makes the <-> preconditon </-> <+> precondition </+> for
establishing a democratic political system possible .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#83:1>
It seems that Hong Kong is not without supportive precondition .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#84:1>
However , as mentioned , this is not as simple as a linear relations
that one plus one is two .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#85:1>
Within this political area there are other counter balancing factors
that make the picture more complex . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#86:1>
<p> Within Hong Kong context , there are internal institutional limits that
makes some political factors unfavourable .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#87:1>
Firstly , there are not much of an established <-> hierachy </-> <+>
hierarchy </+> of leadership that makes equal competition among different
interest groups impossible .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#88:1>
Secondly , the distrust and cut-throat competition among the
political elites impose great constraints in developing a
cooperative-competitive elite culture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#89:1>
For example , there are conflicting ideas between the appointed <->
elities </-> <+> elites </+> or the <-> entrepeneurs </-> <+> entrepreneurs
</+> and the reformists .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#90:1>
Thirdly the representation of the functional groups are skeptical .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#91:1>
For example , is the Hong Kong workers  '  Union really working for the
interests of the workers ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#92:1>
Fourthly , those appointed by , the bureaucracy will choose to exit
rather than voice to respond the new environment . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#93:1>
<p> Despite this China is an influential factor affecting the political
atmosphere towards democratization for she will be the sovereign in the near
future .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#94:1>
Probably no one will reject the view that China is standing on a
position refusing radical democratization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#95:1>
Reasons are three-folded .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#96:1>
First , democratization , accompanied by group activism , mass
volatility and emergence of party politics , would make political control by
China much more difficult .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#97:1>
Second , in the view of China , the <-> existiong </-> <+> existing
</+> depoliticized system of government by bureaucrats is the <-> connerstone
</-> <+> corner stone </+> of Hong Kong  ' s economic progress , so any drastic
changes could unleash unpredictable forces which may be detrimental to
stability prosperity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-005#98:1>
Third , China fears that the <-> democratezation </-> <+>
democratization </+> of Hong Kong may have demonstration effect to the
Mainland China and Hong Kong may become a subversive , anticommunist base .
