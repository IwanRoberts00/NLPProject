<bold> Journey </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#2:1>
&ldquo; <indig> <it> Ah tai gong </it> </indig> &rdquo; was how my
brother , sister and I called my great-grandfather .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#3:1>
He was a very well respected old man in the village .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#4:1>
Before dying at the age of ninety-four , he had had a rather long and
extraordinary life , one that most people would like to live .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#5:1>
He had four sons and one daughter in two marriages with my &ldquo;
<indig> ah tai ma </indig> &rdquo; and another mistress in <it> Kam Mun </it>
, Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#6:1>
None of his children stayed in the country where their father  ' s roots
lay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#7:1>
They went away from China to different places , and settled down in
alien countries .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#8:1>
I always ask my mother why they would want to go to those distant
places , leaving their parents and wives alone in the village and never come
home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#9:1>
Why would these sons  '  wives still wait for them after twenty , thirty
or more years ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#10:1>
The three sons of <indig> <it> ah tai gong </it> </indig> and
<indig> <it> ah tai ma </it> </indig> went to the Philippines and the
daughter went to Malaysia .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#11:1>
Another great uncle is in Taiwan now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#12:1>
He visited us once a few years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#13:1>
Though he is an illegitimate son , it is he who reminds me most of my
great-grandfather , particular his rather slim and distinctive profile and
the very special long eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#14:1>
They did not look too long , but they just had the right shape and
size to make them look charming and deep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#15:1>
There were the rather fleshy and long ears that symbolize long life
according to Chinese <indig> <it> face-reading </it> </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#16:1>
And that was all I noticed about this Taiwanese born son of my
great-grandfather .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#17:1>
I requested my grandmother and mother to tell more stories about my
great-grandfather with whom I spent my first few years of life with in <it>
Calai </it> , while my mother was working in the commune farms and my father
was in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#18:1>
Coffee , cigars , wood carving and furniture making are my
strongest memories of my great-grandfather .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#19:1>
He always liked to make some coffee for my brother and me to drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#20:1>
I still remember how his special coffee tasted and smelled .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#21:1>
It was not like any coffee I drink now , not like Irish coffee ,
cappuccino or espresso .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#22:1>
It was like an almond coffee with milk &semi; it really had some thin
slices of almond mixed in the drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#23:1>
My mother always complained when she saw him making coffee for us
&semi; she hated it when he let us use an old man  ' s cup :

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#24:1>
&ldquo; <indig> <it> Ah gong </it> </indig> , it is not good for
children to drink coffee . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#25:1>
She muttered that he should keep himself clean and take care of
himself first before treating these children to a coffee regularly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#26:1>
But he would never listen to her &semi; he made some for us when my
mother was out working or washing clothes at the well nearby .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#27:1>
My brother and I just loved it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#28:1>
We treated it as a special drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#29:1>
Funnily enough , I do not like drinking coffee much now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#30:1>
Maybe it is not as good as the coffee my great-grandfather made ,
with that lovely almond smell and smooth texture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#31:1>
My great-grandfather always smoked a pipe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#32:1>
He did not actually stop smoking at any time , despite his old age .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#33:1>
I was not surprised because many men had this habit then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#34:1>
They would not think of it as being unhealthy or harmful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#35:1>
My great-grandfather smoked a pipe while the other men smoked
cigarettes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#36:1>
I did not wonder at that time why he smoked that dark brown <it>
grass </it> &semi; I wondered more about what he was thinking when he was
smoking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#37:1>
Often , he sat outside the stone bench outside the front gate of our
house smoking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#38:1>
All the brown grass inside the container of the pipe lit up with
orange light and became smaller and darker as he sucked the mouth of the pipe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#39:1>
The brown grass was burnt and became dark ash .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#40:1>
He blew out the smoke through his mouth , which seemed to be easier
for an old man as it required less strength .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#41:1>
The smoke escaped and floated up on either side of his high nose ,
then flew to somewhere I could not see .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#42:1>
He looked very calm and relaxed , very thoughtful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#43:1>
I was then too young to ask what he was thinking about but I just
remembered he looked as if he was thinking deeply .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#44:1>
What would be in this old man  ' s mind ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#45:1>
But now , I sometimes ask myself whether he was really thinking or
not .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#46:1>
He never told me and I never asked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#47:1>
Sometimes , other villagers passed by and they would say &ldquo;
hello &rdquo; to him and that was the only voice that I would hear for a long
time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#48:1>
It was not until the last time I visited my hometown that I found
out my great-grandfather was also a talented wood carver .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#49:1>
I did not see him carve in those years , I only remember him making a
set of table and chairs once or twice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#50:1>
He skillfully shaved off the rough parts of the wood with a plane ,
measured the size he wanted and he cut the wood into pieces .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#51:1>
He used rather thin wood which he would be able to cut apart easily .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#52:1>
After he had smoothed the splinters off with sandpaper , he would
join the different parts of the furniture and nail them together .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#53:1>
A shiny polish might be painted on the table after dusting and
washing the sawdust off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#54:1>
Excellent wood seems to last longer and changes to a darker shade .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#55:1>
Making furniture was not unusual for him even in his old age .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#56:1>
He had owned a furniture shop in one of the urban areas of <it>
Fukien </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#57:1>
He probably made most of the furniture for selling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#58:1>
At the age of fourteen , I understood the artistic nature of wood
carving &semi; especially after taking a close look at his works that were
displayed on the floor of the common room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#59:1>
I never saw them before because they had been locked inside a huge
Chinese cupboard in the dark and dirty storeroom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#60:1>
My fear of mice and hatred of spider webs stopped me from searching
in the storeroom when I was little , and that is the reason why I never found
those valuable carvings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#61:1>
Usually , each of these wood carvings had a stand to support it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#62:1>
The stand  ' s surrounding frame was irregular in shape so as to make
it more natural , like ordinary ground .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#63:1>
The stand was not very big , so it would not take over the dominant
status of the subjects .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#64:1>
The most impressive one was that of a farmer and his cow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#65:1>
The expression of the farmer was so real .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#66:1>
He had a kind smile on his face and was holding a rope that was tied
to the cow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#67:1>
The wrinkles , cheek bones , lip and jaw shape as well as fingers and
toe nails of the figure had been carved with great delicacy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#68:1>
The clothes were realistic , with each pant-leg folded up to a
different height .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#69:1>
His shirt was quite worn out and he was barefoot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#70:1>
The cow was carved with the correct proportion and the features
resembled those of real cows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#71:1>
Its tail was swaying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#72:1>
It was a graceful and realistic picture of a farmer and his companion .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#73:1>
Beside this , there were a horse , an <it> Iron Buddha </it> and a
landscape of a hill .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#74:1>
These wooden carvings have remained in good shape &dash; no insects
holes or rotten parts &dash; although some branches of the landscape trees
have become too old and looked as if they would drop off from its trunk .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#75:1>
My mother then took the carvings out , washed them , and let the
sun shine on them for a day or two , hoping this would help them last longer .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#76:1>
She was doing it in remembrance of my great-grandfather .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#77:1>
But my father was a bit more practical &semi; he was hoping that
these carvings would become antiques and that he could make some money out of
them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#78:1>
Before returning to Hong Kong , my parents told our relatives to take
good care of those carvings which were really quite old &semi; some were
sixty or seventy years old already .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#79:1>
Their ages have increased by ten years since then . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#80:1>
I remember that my great-grandfather died just one year before
our journey to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#81:1>
There was a big funeral .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#82:1>
Almost all villagers attended and they mourned him , but none of his
children were there to see their father for the last time . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#83:2>
<bold> MY AUNT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#84:2>
I just received my Aunt Qi Xiang  ' s letter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#85:2>
She told us about her life recently and about how she would complete
her accounting course the next month .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#86:2>
We all congratulated her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#87:2>
My Aunt Qi Xiang is 56 years old now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#88:2>
She has one son , a 26-year-old businessman and a daughter who is 23
years old and is studying in university .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#89:2>
My aunt has worked as an accounts clerk in a grain store in a city of
Guangdong in Mainland since she married a city man . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#90:2>
When I was a young girl my mother always told me about Aunt Qi
Xiang  ' s life and character .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#91:2>
My mother also appreciated her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#92:2>
I love my aunt very much .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#93:2>
I remembered that once my mother told me that my aunt had a
frightening experience . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#94:2>
One day , my aunt was riding a bicycle with a big heavy sack of
rice tied to back of the bicycle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#95:2>
When she was crossing a bridge , she lost control of the bike and
fell off the bridge into a deep , rapidly flowing river .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#96:2>
Although she landed on rocks in the river , she did not quit .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#97:2>
She swam to the river bank using all of her effort .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#98:2>
Fortunately she was saved .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#99:2>
However , her nose was no longer straight and pointed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#100:2>
She now has a snub nose with a half-inch scar on the right side .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#101:2>
She always says , &ldquo; I have lost my only pride . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#102:2>
My aunt is kind and thoughtful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#103:2>
She once asked for a week  ' s leave to take care of my mother while
my mother was recovering from minor surgery .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#104:2>
She likes helping people too , so she always carries sacks of rice
for clients . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#105:2>
One afternoon during a hot summer , my mother said she hoped
Aunt Qi Xiang could be in Hong Kong as she was good at making ice bars
especially milk bars and bars with red beans .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#106:2>
When I heard that , I hoped to visit my aunt since I wanted to taste
the ice bars . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#107:2>
One summer vacation &dash; I was eight that year &dash; my
mother brought me to my aunt  ' s home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#108:2>
When the door opened , a 1.6-metre-tall thin woman appeared in front
of me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#109:2>
She had a darker skin colour than us and her square face had some
freckles on it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#110:2>
Her eyes were small but bright , and her lips were thick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#111:2>
Although she had a plain face , she gave people a kind feeling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#112:2>
She gave us a warm embrace and said in a low heavy tone , &ldquo;
Come in ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#113:2>
My first impression of my aunt was that she was smart and kind .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#114:2>
My aunt is kind to others but strict to her children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#115:2>
She did not allow them to come late for dinner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#116:2>
She also wanted them to concentrate on their studies and to behave
well .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#117:2>
However my elder cousin always let her down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#118:2>
One day that summer , it was time for dinner and my cousin had not
come back yet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#119:2>
My aunt did not say a word and her face turned red gradually .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#120:2>
We knew that my cousin would not have dared to come home when he
made mistakes outside or fought with his peers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#121:2>
That night , we all ate our dinner in silence .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#122:2>
When the clock struck twelve , my cousin came back with dirt and
wounds on face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#123:2>
His clothes were dirty and torn ,

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#124:2>
My aunt asked, &rdquo; Where have you been . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#125:2>
&ldquo; In the street . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#126:2>
My cousin answered in a very low tone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#127:2>
&ldquo; What about your face? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#128:2>
My aunt asked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#129:2>
&ldquo; By my peers . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#130:2>
My cousin replied . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#131:2>
My aunt couldn't help her anger . She dashed into the kitchen
quickly and picked up a knife .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#132:2>
She shouted at my cousin , &ldquo; I  ' ll chop off your ears .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#133:2>
They are no longer useful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#134:2>
You won't listen to anything I tell you . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#135:2>
She came out of the kitchen , moved towards my cousin and raised the
knife .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#136:2>
My mother ran to her and held her hand tightly to prevent a tragedy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#137:2>
My cousin was frightened and ran out of the house as fast as an
arrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#138:2>
My cousin has behaved a little better than before since that
horrible night . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#139:2>
That was the first time I knew my aunt could be violent .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#140:2>
She did not regret her actions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#141:2>
She believed corporal punishment was unavoidable and a useful way to
teach children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#142:2>
Her belief may be correct because my cousin has graduated from
university and has a good job .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#143:2>
He always thanks his mother  ' s teaching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-006#144:2>
My aunt can live leisurely now as her children have grown up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#145:2>
But she is still hardworking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#146:2>
She is aware of that she lacks knowledge .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#147:2>
So she attended a training programme provided by her store .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#148:2>
Now she only has few lessons left .

<ICE-HK:W2F-006#149:2>
I wish she will have a good result . </p> </I>
