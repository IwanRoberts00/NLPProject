Dear friends I  ' ve been thinking recently about the time I
spent in California and now it has changed for the better in ways that Hong
Kong has yet to do

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#2:1:A>
The smog where I lived in Los Angeles was terrible but they have
taken firm action to stop it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#3:1:A>
Here in Hong Kong we still have to fight to introduce a one thousand
dollar fine for a smoky vehicle

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#4:1:A>
The traffic was bad in Los Angeles but they have since expanded the
road network

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#5:1:A>
We can't really do that in Hong Kong but we don't control traffic
growth either so our traffic jam just get worse and worse

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#6:1:A>
And then there is the issue of smoking

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#7:1:A>
Since I was there California has placed more and more restrictions
on where people can smoke in order to protect those who don't

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#8:1:A>
This Wednesday the tenth of January I plan to introduce a motion
into the Legislative Council calling on the Government to measure public
opinion on extending bans on smoking into a wider range of places

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#9:1:A>
I  ' m doing so because I believe public opinion overwhelmingly
supports ban on smoking in more the places in which they work travel and
enjoy <?> themself </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#10:1:A>
I believe public opinion supports such measures not just because
secondhand smoke is irritating but because it  ' s a health hazard

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#11:1:A>
Like you I  ' m sure I like to look after myself

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#12:1:A>
My health is very very important to me

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#13:1:A>
In fact when I was a student at university in California I nearly
died from a rare arterial disease

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#14:1:A>
When you experience something like that you realize how lucky you
are and you really value your physical well-being

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#15:1:A>
It concerns me therefore when I am forced to breathe other people  ' s
cigarette smoke

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#16:1:A>
In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency reports
that secondhand smoke causes around three thousand lung cancer death each
year in nonsmoking adults and impairs the respiratory health of hundreds and
thousand of children

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#17:1:A>
Not many people realize it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#18:1:A>
They also affect people with heart disease and contributes to many
deaths of people as a result

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#19:1:A>
The chemicals in secondhand cigarette smoke affect the heart muscle
and the ability of blood vessels to control blood pressure

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#20:1:A>
It also makes blood stickier and increases the likelihood of a
heart attacks

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#21:1:A>
The World Health Organization has reported that passive smoking
leads to around fifteen times as many death from heart disease from lung
cancer

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#22:1:A>
Research from around the world has shown that environmental tobacco
smoke can induce and exacerbate bronchitis and pneumonia

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#23:1:A>
It can affect the health of unborn children

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#24:1:A>
It is a cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#25:1:A>
It is particularly dangerous for children and to non-smokers with
medical condition such as asthma

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#26:1:A>
Here in Hong Kong Professor Lam Tai-hing an expert in family
medicine at The Hong Kong University conducted a survey of non-smokers in the
workforce

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#27:1:A>
He found that one in seven of them suffered from respiratory
illness in one year as a result of other people smoking in the same workplace

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#28:1:A>
According to Dr Sarah McGhee of Hong Kong University  ' s Department
of Community Medicine the medical bill for those additional illnesses would
be more than hundred and fifty million dollars a year

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#29:1:A>
The evidence that passive smoking is dangerous is well-documented

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#30:1:A>
Naturally cigarette companies have sought to cast doubt on this
issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#31:1:A>
They describe the evidence as controversial or they claim that
nothing has been proved

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#32:1:A>
However the evidence is overwhelming

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#33:1:A>
The research reports as I have just mentioned come from the highly
respected sources

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#34:1:A>
And it is because of this that governments around the world have
been placing more and more restrictions on where smoking is permitted

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#35:1:A>
Not so many years ago here in Hong Kong it was perfectly legal to
smoke in cinemas in buses in taxis in shopping centres and many other places

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#36:1:A>
Today we take it for granted that we would have a smoke-free
environment in those locations

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#37:1:A>
But in many countries smoking has been banned in even more places

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#38:1:A>
In most Australian state smoking is now banned in cafes restaurants
and dining areas and pubs and clubs

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#39:1:A>
In the USA hundreds of cities and the entire state of California
had banned smoking in all restaurants and in all workplaces such as offices

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#40:1:A>
In Singapore they have gone further still

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#41:1:A>
A smoker waiting outdoors for bus or taxi is not allowed to smoke
if more than two other people join the queue

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#42:1:A>
I am not suggesting that we in Hong Kong rush to emulate these
places

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#43:1:A>
Similar laws exist in France and Italy but as anyone sees when they
visit Europe the laws are simply ignored

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#44:1:A>
No one enforces them and people don't seem to obey them at all

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#45:1:A>
This is why the motion I am introducing to the Legislative Council
calls for the government to measure public opinion on this issue

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#46:1:A>
I want to know how far people in Hong Kong want to go in banning
smoking

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#47:1:A>
Do they feel it is reasonable to ban smoking in gardens and parks
or not

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#48:1:A>
Do they feel it would be realistic to ban smoking in partially
closed areas like the Mid Levels escalator

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#49:1:A>
Do they think it would be desirable and workable to totally ban
smoking in large restaurants or maybe all restaurants

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#50:1:A>
Would they like a ban on smoking in all offices

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#51:1:A>
If we know how many people want a smoke-free environment in more
public places the government will be better equipped to introduce legislation
that is reasonable and acceptable to large numbers of people

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#52:1:A>
The Government will also be able to make adequate provision for
enforcement so we can be sure that people will comply with any new
restrictions

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#53:1:A>
So far we have some evidence that the vast majority of people do
want more curbs on smoking

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#54:1:A>
A Council on Smoking and Health survey showed that sixty nine
percent of people wanted all restaurants to be smoke-free

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#55:1:A>
Letters in the newspapers about this subject are usually in favour
of more restrictions

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#56:1:A>
But I believe <,> we need a thorough and detailed survey of public
opinion

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#57:1:A>
It should use a truly representative sample of the population

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#58:1:A>
And it should specifically ask people where they would like to see
further restrictions on smoking

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#59:1:A>
If public opinion is behind the Government I believe we could see
smoking restrictions introduced and enforced in a wider range of places that
is currently the case

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#60:1:A>
The benefits in terms of health for people who do not wish to smoke
will be very real

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#61:1:A>
Like air pollution from diesel powered vehicles it is not simply
unpleasant or irritating

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#62:1:A>
It damages the health of our people and it poses a particular
threat to the very young and to those who are already suffer from respiratory
and heart conditions

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#63:1:A>
I like to make one point very clear

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#64:1:A>
I am not seeking in any way to pick on people who smoke

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#65:1:A>
I believe adults have the right to make an informed choice about
smoking

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#66:1:A>
It is simply that people should also have the right not to smoke if
they wish

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#67:1:A>
Many people who smoke nowadays are usually fairly considerate
towards the rest of us

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#68:1:A>
And I believe most smokers sincerely do not wish to damage the
health of other people

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#69:1:A>
If you put it to them that way I believe many of them would accept
more restrictions especially if the rules are enforced

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#70:1:A>
Indeed according to the World Health Organization restrictions on
smoking are highly effective in helping smokers cut down their cigarette
consumption

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#71:1:A>
So smoke-free areas are usually good news for everyone apart from
the tobacco companies

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#72:1:A>
I will be introducing this motion in the Legislative Council this
coming Wednesday

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#73:1:A>
The motion simply said and I quote in view of the hazards of
passive smoking this Council urges the Government to conduct studies on the
necessity for and the feasibility of designating more public places as
no-smoking areas

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#74:1:A>
And in the course of the studies the Government should ensure that
the public are fully consulted and their views are included in the study
report

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#75:1:A>
I think that many people in Hong Kong would like to see the
Government conduct such a study

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#76:1:A>
And I hope they let their representatives in the Legislative
Council know how they feel and urge them to support my motion

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#77:1:A>
We in Hong Kong may not have the space and the mild weather of
California but we can still aim at matching its quality of life

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#78:1:A>
If we can introduce more smoke-free areas in public places it will
make our children and our whole community measurably safer and healthier </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-037#79:2:A>
There used to be a time when the people of Hong Kong accepted
the ups and downs that happen when you have a free market

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#80:2:A>
People generally understood that competition and free markets
create both winners and losers but in a long run we all benefit

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#81:2:A>
Old industries might die out the new ones come along

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#82:2:A>
The economy develops

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#83:2:A>
People become more prosperous

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#84:2:A>
Today however there seems to be a different mood

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#85:2:A>
It seems that our community has a growing distrust of market forces
and a growing preference for government intervention

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#86:2:A>
This is probably a reaction to the economic reversal of recent
years after a long period of economic boom

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#87:2:A>
Back in the nineteen eighties and nineties Hong Kong became rich
almost without trying

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#88:2:A>
As China opened up to foreign investment money poured into Hong
Kong on its way to the Mainland

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#89:2:A>
Our prices went up but so did the value of the work we did

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#90:2:A>
Factories closed and moved across the border

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#91:2:A>
The financial and commercial services extended rapidly creating
more and better-paid jobs than ever

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#92:2:A>
In addition to that a property bubble started to develop driven by
a shortage of supply and artificially low interest rates

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#93:2:A>
Thanks to that some people became even richer by doing even less
work

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#94:2:A>
Of course it was too good to last

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#95:2:A>
When the Asian financial crisis broke out in uh nineteen ninety
seven and ninety eight Hong Kong  ' s bubble burst

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#96:2:A>
Now after a couple of very difficult years our economy is
fundamentally sound

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#97:2:A>
But few people believe it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#98:2:A>
They want to go back to the nineties the days when you could get
rich quickly without even trying

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#99:2:A>
And they look to the government expecting our officials to wave a
magic wand and create another boom just like that

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#100:2:A>
Understandably the government wants to appear to be caring and
responsive

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#101:2:A>
It tells people yes we understand how you feel

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#102:2:A>
We  ' re trying to help economy improve

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#103:2:A>
Unfortunately this is the wrong response

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#104:2:A>
It will be better if the government said don't come to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#105:2:A>
The government doesn't run the economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#106:2:A>
We look after the physical and institutional infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#107:2:A>
You the people of Hong Kong do the rest

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#108:2:A>
It would not be popular politically

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#109:2:A>
But it would give people a badly needed reminder that free markets
and competition not government activity will bring economic growth

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#110:2:A>
Banks will now have to compete more than they did beforehand

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#111:2:A>
And like every other business they will use all sorts of ways to
compete for the most profitable customers to curb their costs and to increase
their profits

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#112:2:A>
In some cases they will introduce charges for retail banking
services

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#113:2:A>
These are normal in most countries

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#114:2:A>
But the public response here in Hong Kong have been quite amazing

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#115:2:A>
In a free market with free competition companies are free to
charge whatever they want

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#116:2:A>
And as customers we are free to take our business elsewhere

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#117:2:A>
Yet it seems today that every time a company raises its prices we
get calls for the government to intervene

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#118:2:A>
The people who oppose the price rises often point out that higher
prices hurt the poor more than the rich

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#119:2:A>
They are undoubtedly right in saying this

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#120:2:A>
And I fully agree with them that we should care for the weakest
members of our community

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#121:2:A>
However these protesters are wrong to demand private sector
companies should provide welfare subsidies

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#122:2:A>
And they are even more wrong to look to the government to pressure
the private sector to do so

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#123:2:A>
This may sound rather brutal but it is not the role of private
sector companies to directly subsidize the poor

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#124:2:A>
Companies exist in order to create wealth for their owners

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#125:2:A>
They may pay good salaries to their staff

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#126:2:A>
They may offer good value to their customers

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#127:2:A>
They may make donation to charity and do other things to help the
community

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#128:2:A>
But these are simply means to an end the creation of shareholder
wealth

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#129:2:A>
It seems some people in in Hong Kong today have forgotten this
hard simple reality

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#130:2:A>
They believe companies should be obliged to subsidize the less
well-off

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#131:2:A>
You might think that sounds fair

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#132:2:A>
But now stop and ask where should this subsidy come from

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#133:2:A>
Should it come from the company  ' s staff in the form of lower pay

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#134:2:A>
Should it come from the richer customers if there is a way of
identifying them and charging them more

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#135:2:A>
Or should it come from the shareholders in a form of lower profits

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#136:2:A>
People demanding that companies should keep prices down to help
the poor uh asking those companies to organize a compulsory redistribution of
wealth

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#137:2:A>
But that is a function of government

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#138:2:A>
Private-sector companies in free markets compete to make the most
profit

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#139:2:A>
The companies that make the most profit have the privilege of
paying the most tax

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#140:2:A>
That tax is spent by government on welfare payments and other
social programs overseen by a Legislative Council that represents the people

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#141:2:A>
That is the transparent way to redistribute wealth without
interfering in the market

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#142:2:A>
Right to say that we need to redistribute wealth to ensure the
poor have the decent standard of living

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#143:2:A>
But they are wrong to complain profit-making companies are not
performing that function

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#144:2:A>
These protesters could argue that our welfare programs are not
giving enough money to the people who most need it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#145:2:A>
However people in Hong Kong today are more likely to protest
against better targeted welfare payments than in favor of them

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#146:2:A>
Alternatively these protesters could argue that there is too
little competition and the prices are unfairly high

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#147:2:A>
This may be the case in some sectors of our economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#148:2:A>
However it seems people in Hong Kong today are more likely to
protest against competition than in favor of it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#149:2:A>
It seems that our whole community wants to be protected from
change

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#150:2:A>
People ask the government to interfere with banks ' decision to
introduce charges even though they will be getting higher interest on their
savings

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#151:2:A>
People ask the government for assistance because their property is
worth less than they paid for

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#152:2:A>
People ask the government to cap the numbers of skilled and
professional Mainlanders coming to work here even though we have and need
unlimited number of people from foreign countries doing the same thing

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#153:2:A>
People ask the government to boost spending and reduce taxes

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#154:2:A>
Hong Kong needs to go through changes a lot more changes

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#155:2:A>
And not all of those changes will be easy

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#156:2:A>
For example my own industry the general insurance industry is
currently losing large amounts of money in some areas of business

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#157:2:A>
It is inevitable during the coming year that the some companies in
my industry in Hong Kong will go out of business or consolidate

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#158:2:A>
It is a painful process

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#159:2:A>
But we have to go through it

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#160:2:A>
And in the end we will have a stronger and more successful
insurance industry

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#161:2:A>
The whole of Hong Kong is exposed to that sort of pressure

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#162:2:A>
We have to change and adapt to new circumstances

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#163:2:A>
Instead people ask the government to prevent change

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#164:2:A>
It seems they do not trust free market

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#165:2:A>
They are suspicious of deregulation and competition

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#166:2:A>
They believe that government can make things better by interfering
with the market

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#167:2:A>
It is ironic that as the Mainland moves to embrace market forces
some people in Hong Kong are demanding that we go in the opposite direction

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#168:2:A>
Let us hope that as we realize the nineteen nineties are over
there will be more confidence in free markets and competition

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#169:2:A>
More confidence in Hong Kong  ' s ability to embrace change

<ICE-HK:S2B-037#170:2:A>
And less belief that the government can make sure everyone always
wins and nobody ever loses </I>
