Dear Mr. <O> name </O> , <h>

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#9:1>
<ul> Re : Medical Scheme Queries </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#10:1>
Concerning the definition and practice of reimbursement as to
Item C and Item D of OUTPATIENT BENEFITS under the Group Health Scheme , for
your information , we clarify the wording below . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#11:1>
1 &cbrack; <ul> Diagnostic X-rays &ampersand; Laboratory Examinations
</ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#12:1>
Benefits regarding X-rays , Laboratory Tests and Examinations pay
in respect of expenses pertaining to or subserving diagnosis of or serving as
a criterion of a disease , as signs and symptoMs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#13:1>
In other words , there must be referral letter from the Medical
Practitioner , stating the medical reason for the recommendation of an X-ray
, Check up etc . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#14:1>
2 &cbrack; <ul> Specialist visits </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#15:1>
&ldquo; <mention> Specialist </mention> &rdquo; shall mean a
Physician who limits his practice to the study and treatment of one class of
disease , organs or systems of the body . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#16:1>
Contd ...

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#17:1>
For example , an applicant who suffers from Bronchitis , but who
consults a Cardiac Specialist , could not claim Specialist Benefits , as the
qualifications of the Doctor would be inappropriate to the symptoms of the
illness .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#18:1>
A further example , where the same rule would apply , would be where
a person suffering from influenza consulted a Gynaecological Specialist ,
this would be completely inappropriate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#19:1>
For ease of administration and in order to speed up settlement of
claims and to avoid any shortfall made arose from General practitioner and
Specialist  ' s items , it would be preferable if the claimant could acquaint
himself/herself with the qualifications of the Doctor concerned and ensure
this was shown on the medical bills and receipts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#20:1>
Or where this is not shown , we would like an indication of his
professional qualification and as it applies to the persons particular
medical condition , copy of Doctor  ' s name card is of help . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#21:1>
Please do feel free to contact us if you look for further
assistance .

Re : Medical Policy &hash;LM/2654 </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#35:2>
This will acknowledge your letter of 1st February 1991 addressed
to our Group Managing Director and which Mr. Peter Humble has passed to me
for attention . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#36:2>
I have noted your comments concerning your dissatisfaction with
the claims servicing of this insurance and have looked into this matter
thoroughly .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#37:2>
I enclose herewith a statement of the claims record from which you
will note there are several slight discrepancies in the time the claim was
sent and when this was received .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#38:2>
However , I would like to state that none of these claims stretched
into a three month period , but unforunately some did take as long as two
months to settle for various reasons .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#39:2>
Obviously this is rather unacceptable to your client and we are
taking the necessary steps to ensure that a more speedy and efficient claims
settling period will take place in the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#40:2>
Regarding the points made in respect of the policy benefits we do
apologise for the confusion which arose in this instance , but would like to
point out that your client  ' s policy is tailor-made and therefore slightly
different from the normal policy wording and conditions . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#41:2>
..... / page 2

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#42:2>
We do not wish to go through the various points made in your
letter as there would appear to be conflicting versions on several instances
, however we do wish to assure you and our mutual client that we will do our
best to ensure that the delay in settlement of claims in the future will be
kept to an absolute minimum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#43:2>
I trust the above will help clarify the unforunate situation
which has arisen but please do not hesitate to contact us again should you
wish to discuss this further . </p>

This will acknowledge your letter of 25/10/89 answering our
enquires , for which we thank you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#64:3>
However , we are suprised to note you have also enclosed a bill in
the amount of HK&dollar;150.00 In view of the fact that at no time was it
agreed between us that we would be charged for the information concerning
your patient  ' s treatment and visits , we are unwilling to accept this
unsolicited bill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#65:3>
We would point out that we often ask other physicians details of
their patients  '  illness/symptoms and we are never charged for this
information . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#66:3>
We therefore trust you will cancel this bill and thank you for
your assistance in this matter. </p>

existing <O> name </O> voluntary scheme  ' s underwriters <O> name </O>
Insurance Group for your kind consideration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#82:5>
We suggest that the limit of indemnity of the compulsory layer
provided by the Association can be either HK&dollar;5 million or HK&dollar;10
million .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#83:5>
Then each individual member can purchase his/her own top up/excess
layer <-> upto </-> <+> up to </+> his/her own requirement &obrack; say
HK&dollar;50 million &cbrack; if necessary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#84:5>
The scheme has been designed that you can divide the premium
amongst <O> name </O> as you feel it is acceptable .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#85:5>
That is <O> name </O> can pay more than <O> name </O> if necessary .

Dear Mr. Sukumar

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#136:9>
I am writing to request for your kind assistance in helping a
group of eighteen students from the Society of Accounting and Finance of our
College in making a visit to Malaysia and Singapore from 5 to 12 February
1995 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#137:9>
They have planned to stay in Malaysia from 5 to 9 of February and in
Singapore from 10 to 12 February . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-023#138:9>
They have sent a letter to the Director of Student Affairs
Office and a visiting lecturer of the National University of Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#139:9>
As a matter of fact , they would like to visit the Department of
Accounting and Finance of the University of Singapore so as to get themselves
familiar with the academic requirements of the department and some aspects of
campus life in Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W1B-023#140:9>
Of course , it would be most desirable if the Department of
Accounting and Finance can also expose this group of students to actual
demands and requirement in some accounting firMs. </p>

<p>

I deeply apologize for the rush manner in seeking for your
assistance .
