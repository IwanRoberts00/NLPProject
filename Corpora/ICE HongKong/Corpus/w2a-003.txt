CONTEMPORARY FEMINIST READING OF THE &ldquo; ONTOLOGICAL &rdquo; BODY
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#4:1>
Most recently , feminist philosophers and biologists have been
trying to destabilize the notion of &ldquo; biological sex . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#5:1>
Judith Butler is one of the former :

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#6:1>
Her famous argument is that the body positioned as prior to the sign
is always &ldquo; posited &rdquo; or &ldquo; signified &rdquo; as &ldquo;
prior &rdquo; and &ldquo; precedes &rdquo; its own action .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#7:1>
If this is so , then there should not be a mimetic or representational
status of language or signs that follow bodies , for the body is only
signified as prior to signification . <sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#8:1>
The positing process also constitutes and conditions the &ldquo;
materiality &rdquo; of the body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#9:1>
She states that what enables this positing is a problematic gendered
matrix that ontologizes and fixes the &ldquo; irreducible &rdquo; materiality
into a plethora of taken-for-granted discourses on sex and sexuality . <sp>
<fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#10:1>
We can sketch at least a few ways these discourses are conducted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#11:1>
First , as Luce Irigaray argues , inasmuch as a distinction between
form and matter is offered within phallogocentrism , there is an exclusion of
the &ldquo; female . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#12:1>
Within the masculine-female &obrack; form-matter &cbrack; binary ,
the masculine in fact occupies both poles , and the female is not an
intelligible term .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#13:1>
Irigaray further argues that the &ldquo; female &rdquo; is
articulated through a further materiality acting as the impossible necessity
that enables any ontology . <sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#14:1>
Second , aside from philosophy , the binding , forming , and
deforming of gendered bodies through social prohibitions and the so-called
cultural intelligibility criteria of sex also constitute and regulate the
fields of bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#15:1>
According to Moira Gatens , the body politic uses the human body as
its image , model , or metaphor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#16:1>
The body politic uses one type of body &obrack; male &cbrack; to
signify various items : diverse bodies &semi; the oppositions of the &ldquo;
self &rdquo; to others &semi; and many forms of oppressive ideologies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#17:1>
All human bodies are part of these systems of exchange ,
identification , and mimesis . <sp> <fnr> 4 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#18:1>
In addition , medical discourses have so far maintained the hegemony
of heteropolarity by mapping differences onto bodies that illustrate gender ,
thereby eliding Foucault  ' s suggestion of sociopolitical construction of
bodies under particular kinds of needs and desires . <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr>
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#19:1>
Gatens concludes that the recent presiding question is this :

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#20:1>
How does culture construct the body so that it is understood as a
biological given . <sp> <fnr> 6 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#21:1>
The history of the representation of anatomical differences between
man and woman is independent of the actual structure of organs or of what was
known about them .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#22:1>
Ideologies determined how bodies were seen and which differences
would matter . <sp> <fnr> 7 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#23:1>
Therefore , a reevaluation of the importance of the body is to be
conducted in wider arenas , and not merely within feminist social theory ,
but in terms of the analysis of class , culture , and consumption . </p> <it>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#24:1>
Cultural Construction of Female Bodily Existence </h> </it>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#25:1>
How does the above increase our understanding of how the female
body is constructed ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#26:1>
The return to biological essentialism is strongly contested because
&ldquo; physical experiences &rdquo; do not make someone a woman &semi;
rather , identity as a woman depends on the specific social regulatory ideals
by which female bodies are trained and formed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#27:1>
We can at least include in our consideration the categories of
economy , politics , heterosexuality , philosophy , and subject and object
relations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#28:1>
Economically , Judith Butler points out , the female must be the
subordinate term in a binary opposition of masculine-female for that economy
to operate . <sp> <fnr> 8 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#29:1>
Politically , women are constructed as incapable of performing
military service and therefore incapable of defending the political body from
attack .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#30:1>
This is sufficient to exclude them from active citizenship .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#31:1>
The neutral body assumed by the liberal state is implicitly a
masculine body . <sp> <fnr> 9 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#32:1>
The worst social operation is to treat a woman  ' s speech and her
behavior as hysterical &obrack; rooted in the Greek work <it> hystera </it> ,
meaning uterus &cbrack; , thereby confining women to the biological .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#33:1>
Philosophically , Moira Gatens argues that traditional philosophical
conceptions of corporeality are counterproductive to the attempt to construct
an autonomous conception of women  ' s bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#34:1>
In our culture , every woman is normatively defined as the opposite
and complement of man . <sp> <fnr> 10 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#35:1>
It is interesting to read the philosophical metaphors of woman  ' s
body proposed by contemporary philosophers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#36:1>
Iris Young has summarized Simon de Beauvoir  ' s account of woman  ' s
existence in the world as a tension between immanence and transcendence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#37:1>
Influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponty  ' s account of the &ldquo; normal
&rdquo; relationship between human bodies and their environment in actions ,
Young states that bodily action in the world is commonly distinguished by
three features : &ldquo; ambiguous transcendence , &rdquo; &ldquo; inhibited
intentionality , &rdquo; and &ldquo; discontinuous unity . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#38:1>
Young suggests that women often &ldquo; live &rdquo; their bodies in
&ldquo; ambiguous transcendence &rdquo; : transcendence in the sense that the
lived body continuously calls forth capacities applied to the world that
women used to refrain from .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#39:1>
Female bodily existence is an &ldquo; inhibited intentionality
&rdquo; that simultaneously reaches toward a projected end with an &ldquo; I
can &rdquo; and withholds its full bodily commitment to that end in a
self-imposed &ldquo; I cannot . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#40:1>
&ldquo; Discontinuous unity &rdquo; is inspired by Merleau-Ponty  ' s
suggestion that in the enactment of intentions , the body is not an object in
itself , but for women , there is a sense that the body is indeed a &ldquo;
subject &rdquo; as well as an &ldquo; object &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#41:1>
The female body is the object of the gaze of others and an object
frequently experienced as limited and limiting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#42:1>
Young said it is important to recognize the specific and historically
changing forms of restrictions that have been placed on women  ' s movement ,
including such things as restrictive clothing and constricting conventions
about female deportment and demeanor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#43:1>
She said that these modalities do not remain constant but are
culturally variable , subject to changing circumstances and lifestyle . <sp>
<fnr> 11 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#44:1>
These restrictions have even acted as a guide to &obrack; and
prescription for &cbrack; women  ' s mental health , and the very pursuit of
the physical standards imposed may actually cause depression , low
self-esteem , eating disorders and , generally , poor mental health . <sp>

Traditional Western Philosophies Reexamined </h> </it>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#46:1>
In this essay , we are interested in the traditional
philosophical conceptions of corporeality that Gatens has cited .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#47:1>
Feminist scholars usually begin with Plato , who proposed the
dualisms of form-matter , mind-body , and asserted that the body interferes
with , and is a danger to , the operations of reason .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#48:1>
He claimed that the word body &obrack; <it> soma </it> &cbrack; was
introduced by Orphic priests , who believed that man is a spiritual or
noncorporeal being trapped in the body , the <it> soma </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#49:1>
His discourse on the <it> hypodoche </it> is viewed as pertaining to
materiality , that when nature receives form as a sensible object , &ldquo;
her &rdquo; proper function is to receive , take , accept , welcome , include
, and even comprehend .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#50:1>
&ldquo; She &rdquo; has no proper shape and is not a body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#51:1>
The receptacle principle , which applies universally , is then
associated with the female , which is constructed as a nonthematizable
materiality , but which never resembles either the formative principle or
that which it creates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#52:1>
Hence , as the receptacle , the female is a nonliving , shapeless
nonthing , which cannot even be named , leading to the prohibition of the
female body as a human form . <sp> <fnr> 13 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#53:1>
The consequent social implications to both women and corporeality
are thus often negative , and function conceptually to undergird culturally
valued terms such as reason , civilization , and progress .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#54:1>
In Gatens  ' s analysis , many philosophers have seen the soul or mind
as sexually neutral , and the apparent differences among minds are generally
seen to be due to the influence of the passions of the body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#55:1>
This element of sensuous and passionate corporeality enables
philosophers to maintain the essential neutrality of the mind while allowing
for individual and sexual differences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#56:1>
The most superior minds are said to suffer least from the intrusions
of the body . <sp> <fnr> 14 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#57:1>
Gatens further points out that this dualist notion of the body
involves an implicit alignment between women and irrationality .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#58:1>
The ideal conception of the rational is , in other words ,
articulated in direct opposition to qualities typical of the female . <sp>
<fnr> 15 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#59:1>
Many feminists are critical of the way Ren&eacute; Descartes
distinguished two kinds of substances , a thinking substance &obrack; <it>
res cogitans </it> , mind &cbrack; from an extended substance &obrack; <it>
res extensa </it> , body &cbrack; , and the way that he believed that the
latter is governed by its physical laws and ontological exigencies , while
the mind has no place in the natural world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#60:1>
He thus placed the mind in a position of hierarchical superiority
over and above nature , including the nature of the body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#61:1>
The critical questions feminists address to Cartesianism include :

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#62:1>
How can something that inhabits space affect or be affected by
something that is nonspatial ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#63:1>
How can consciousness ensure the body  ' s movements , its receptivity
to conceptual demands and requirements ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#64:1>
How can the body inform the mind of its needs and wishes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#65:1>
How is bilateral communication possible ? <sp> <fnr> 16 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#66:1>
Cartesianism is also criticized as a form of reductionism , denying
any interaction between mind and body , instead focusing on the actions of
either one of the binary terms at the expense of the other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#67:1>
Feminist scholars can identify at least three lines of
investigation of the body in contemporary thought that may be regarded as
legacies of the Cartesian view , which treat the body as primarily an object
for : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; the natural sciences , particularly for the life
sciences , biology , and medicine &semi; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; as an instrument
or a machine at the disposal of consciousness or allocating an animating ,
willful subjectivity &semi; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; as a vehicle of
expression of private thoughts and feelings , that is , as fundamentally
passive and transparent . <sp> <fnr> 17 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#68:1>
Another ramification of Cartesian dualism is that the male-female
opposition has been closely allied with that of the mind-body binary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#69:1>
The conventional reading is that the mind is equivalent to the
masculine , and body to the feminine , excluding women as possible subjects
of knowledge .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#70:1>
By implication , then , women  ' s bodies are presumed to be incapable
of men  ' s achievements &semi; they are viewed as weaker , more prone to
&obrack; hormonal &cbrack; irregularities , intrusions , and
unpredictabilities . <sp> <fnr> 18 </fnr> </sp> </p> <it> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#71:1>
Toward an Open-Ended Ontology </h> </it>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#72:1>
Recently , feminist scholars are seriously thinking of a new
conceptual model that can displace Cartesian dualism and that can emancipate
notions of the body from Cartesian dominant mechanistic models and metaphors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#73:1>
In this light , we review traditional and contemporary alternatives .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#74:1>
Some suggest as an alternative the writings of Baruch Spinoza ,
whose monism is a revision of Cartesian dualism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#75:1>
In Spinoza , there is a multivalent ontology , that has been
neglected in Anglo-American philosophy . <sp> <fnr> 19 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#76:1>
For Spinoza , matter and mind emerge from one underlying process
&dash; or <it> substantia </it> &dash; that is materially grounded in
extension but is also absolute and infinite , and at the same time has mental
attributes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#77:1>
Mind and body emerge from and belong to the same substance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#78:1>
One reading of Spinoza  ' s monism is that the body is not part of
passive nature ruled by an active mind but rather that the body is the
inseparable terrain of human action .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#79:1>
In contrast to the philosophical traditions mentioned , the mind is
constituted by the affirmation of the actual existence of the body , which
enables the activity of reason .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#80:1>
Activity should be understood as one  ' s participation in one  ' s
situation which , instead of being dominated by the mind , depends on the
body  ' s character , manner , and context .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#81:1>
Feminists recognize Spinoza  ' s account of the body as a process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#82:1>
The body  ' s meaning and capabilities will vary according to its
context , and its limits and possibilities can be revealed only by its
ongoing interactions with its environment . <sp> <fnr> 20 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#83:1>
As Gatens suggests , the implication of Spinoza  ' s model is that
in contrast to the essentialist position , its nonmechanical and
nondichotomized view of nature and culture could acknowledge the cultural and
historical specificity of bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#84:1>
What Spinoza contributes to feminist politics is that sexual
difference does not necessarily mean gender difference &semi; gender
differences &obrack; behavioral and affective &cbrack; are different patterns
of relationality in a nature that is transformative and constituted by modes
of power relations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#85:1>
The role of mother or wife thus refers to a historically specific
body that recreates itself in a reduced sphere of activity and social
conditions . <sp> <fnr> 21 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#86:1>
Besides Spinoza , feminists also turn to the phenomenological
reflection on the body , especially to the idea that a subject is not
separated from the world or the mind from body , matter , and space .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#87:1>
Merleau-Ponty  ' s theory of body is predominant in feminist thought :

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#88:1>
The subject is a &ldquo; being-to-the-world . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#89:1>
Merleau-Ponty begins with a fundamental presumption that stands in
contrast to Cartesian dualism of mind and body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#90:1>
In Merleau-Ponty  ' s paradigm , mind and body are necessarily
interrelated &semi; consciousness and nature are related , as are interiority
and exteriority .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#91:1>
The body and the modes of sensual perception that occur through it
affirm the necessary connections of consciousness because it is incarnated
and always grounded on corporeal and sensory relations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#92:1>
Feminist scholars recognize in Merleau-Ponty  ' s construct that the
body is both object for others and a lived reality for the subject .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#93:1>
At the same time it is &ldquo; sense-bestowing &rdquo; and &ldquo;
form-giving , &rdquo; providing structure , organization , and ground within
which objects are to be situated , against which the body-subject is
positioned an by which meaning is generated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#94:1>
Thus , the primary origins of human action reside not in thought but
in movement and motility .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#95:1>
The inspiring notion is that consciousness is in the first place not
a matter of &ldquo; thinking &rdquo; but rather of capability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#96:1>
The most fundamental and essential ability is the fact that body
inhabits spaces and that the objects in it and the possible movements of the
body are integrated in an overall orientation toward action in the world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#97:1>
According to Merleau-Ponty , the life of consciousness is subvented
by an &ldquo; intentional arc &rdquo; based on the body as a nexus of lived
and related meanings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#98:1>
He concluded by giving an ontological priority to certain kinds of
immediate bodily movements and actions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#99:1>
This attracts feminist politics as a meaningful alternative to
Cartesian dualism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#100:1>
The body has remained a conceptual blind spot in both mainstream
Western philosophical thought and contemporary feminist theories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#101:1>
To summarize our discussion , the human subject has long been
regarded as composed by several related binaries : mind and body , sense and
sensibility , outside and inside , self and other , depth and surface ,
reality and appearance , mechanism and vitalism , transcendence and immanence
, temporality and spatiality , psychology and physiology , form and matter ,
and so on .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#102:1>
This binary thinking hierarchizes and ranks two polarized terms so
that one becomes privileged , and the other is suppressed , subordinated ,
and negated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#103:1>
The body is typically regarded as passive and reproductive but
largely unproductive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#104:1>
The situation is more complicated when the body is associated with
the &ldquo; female . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#105:1>
It has even been proposed that it is in the West and in our time
that the female body has been constructed not only as a lack or absence , but
as a formlessness that engulfs all form , a disorder that threatens all order .
<sp> <fnr> 22 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#106:1>
Though some claim that what needs to be changed are attitudes ,
beliefs , and values rather than the body itself , Elizabeth Grosz points out
that culture itself assumes meaning and value in terms of its own other
&obrack; s &cbrack; . <sp> <fnr> 23 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#107:1>
This explains why there is a refusal to transgress the mind-body
binary by proposing its substitution by monism or by a noncontradictory and
nonhierarchized relation between the binarized terms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-003#108:1>
It is not clear whether the holistic or monistic positions
suggested can really resolve the mind-body problem .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#109:1>
Grosz has concisely summarized the feminist questions , which
include :

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#110:1>
By which techniques and presumptions is a nonbinary understanding of
the body possible ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#111:1>
What , ideally , could a feminist philosophy of the body avoid , and
what must it take into consideration ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#112:1>
Which criteria and goals should govern a feminist theoretical
approach to concepts of the body ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#113:1>
The answers would certainly avoid the division of the subject into
mutually exclusive categories of mind and body .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#114:1>
But what is more profitable , as Grosz suggests , is to remain
suspicious of the holism and unity implied by monism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#115:1>
Because the notion of corporeality and the ways materiality can be
conceptualized are still under the constraints of our culture , new concepts
of corporeality that go beyond the regime of dualism should be developed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#116:1>
The new notions from her recent reflections are those that view
human materiality as continuous with organic and inorganic matter , where
physical and linguistic materialities interact and make possible a
materialism beyond a mechanical physicalism , and that then will reorient
physics itself . <sp> <fnr> 24 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#117:1>
This new model must show some sort of internal or constitutive
articulation , or even disarticulation , between the biological and the
psychological , the inside and the outside of the body , while avoiding a
reductionism of mind to brain . <sp> <fnr> 25 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#118:1>
Merleau-Ponty  ' s notion of the flesh is thus regarded as inspiring ,
acting as the elementary , precommunicative ontological domain out of which
both subject and object mutually interact and develop .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#119:1>
Finally , the new conceptual categories should also comprehend
differences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#120:1>
When applied to cultural impositions , these categories should
represent and comprehend bodies as a multiple field of possible body &ldquo;
types &rdquo; : young and old , black and white , male and female , animal
and human , inanimate and animate , no one of which &obrack; <it> pace </it>
, the male &cbrack; would stand in for or represent the others .

<ICE-HK:W2A-003#121:1>
To conclude , this article stresses that there exist alternative
ontologies and modes of metaphysics that , as Christine Battersby suggests ,
are more useful for rethinking female identities . <sp> <fnr> 26 </fnr> </sp>
