<ICE-HK:S2A-067#1:1:A>
For all you know that the the other robberies which occur in
Hong Kong in about mid November <,> when Hong Kong currencies and French
franc might have been involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#2:1:A>
We simply do not know

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#3:1:A>
Further there  ' s the statement <,> if you were to beset Ms Ng  ' s
evidence is the statement by Mr Hau that he  ' s going to get money from people

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#4:1:A>
He  ' s ready get back money from people who deserve

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#5:1:A>
Mind you not think that that that statement is equally consistent
with a claim that they were going to enforce a debt a threat a debt from
people because he used the word get back

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#6:1:A>
And if that might be consistent <,> then you might think the fact
that the following day or some days later that he saw money Hong Kong
currency and French franc in her flat would be equally consistent with the
successful collection of debts or money from other people by this group of
people

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#7:1:A>
You <,> would have learned from newspapers and news medias that in
Hong Kong it is not uncommon that people resort to violence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#8:1:A>
Violence in order to reinforce collection of debts

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#9:1:A>
So here is another point that you might like to take to take into
consideration

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#10:1:A>
Members of the jury <,> what <.> impor </.> what is important
however is that whereas Ms Ng is unable uh rather not not unable has not be
involved in any of the other criminal activities of Mr Hau

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#11:1:A>
You might ask yourself to what end <,> why she was involved in this
<?> from one </?> at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#12:1:A>
Why would Mr Hau and his four associates want to involve her at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#13:1:A>
Did she play any part

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#14:1:A>
Is her part so indispensable that these five robbers at the matter
indiscretion to get her involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#15:1:A>
This is one major point that I would like you to bear in mind

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#16:1:A>
In the light of her evidence that she was quite unaware of Mr Hau  ' s
other criminal activities

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#17:1:A>
We  ' re here talking about a huge robbery involving a sum
approaching eight million Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#18:1:A>
Why on earth should she be involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#19:1:A>
Somebody who was totally unaware of the goings on

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#20:1:A>
And according to her it was at a time when she had indicated her
intension to leave Mr Hau

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#21:1:A>
Wasn't that a huge risk to take on the part of both Mr Hau and his
associates to let her into the know

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#22:1:A>
If her relationship with with Hau was such that Hau did not take
any precaution against her knowledge his activities at all then you might
like to ask yourselves if that is the case how come he was totally unaware of
his other activities of his other associates

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#23:1:A>
She also told you that she was in a great fright <,> on the day
that all these events occur

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#24:1:A>
And she wanted to find out what was happening

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#25:1:A>
She said she paid attention to news

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#26:1:A>
Both on the radio the television and the newspapers

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#27:1:A>
Surprise surprise she told you that she did not find out what the
matter was about

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#28:1:A>
Now in the long course event a robbery of this magnitude would make
equally headlines

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#29:1:A>
<?> Be </?> nothing else

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#30:1:A>
Do not think that if indeed she participated although innocently in
the handling of the proceeds of the robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#31:1:A>
And she was intend on finding out what was happening

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#32:1:A>
Do not think that she would definitely find out from the reading or
from the news media that this was the huge robbery which took place outside
Elizabeth House

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#33:1:A>
No she did not find hard

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#34:1:A>
And if she  ' s telling you the truth at all about not be able to
find out what it was all about that you might not be <,> the right for you
think that perhaps these events that she was telling you about did not happen
on the twentieth of November

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#35:1:A>
After all it might have happened some time before that which is
entirely consistent with her statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#36:1:A>
And if that  ' s the case obviously she would not have been able to
read or to know learn about this robbery from any news media

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#37:1:A>
Members of the jury ultimately you would have to first of all beset
Ms Ng as a credible witness

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#38:1:A>
You have to accept her story

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#39:1:A>
Because without her story there  ' s nothing upon which you could
properly drawn any influences instantly

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#40:1:A>
All that you  ' ve got is that a robbery has occurred and large sums
of money have been robbed

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#41:1:A>
That  ' s it

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#42:1:A>
And therefore it is very important for you to carefully consider
her evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#43:1:A>
Basically her evidence against the defendant consist of two <,>
areas

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#44:1:A>
The first part relate to what happen before her last visit to the
<,> defendant  ' s flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#45:1:A>
And second part relates to what happened after she said she went
home

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#46:1:A>
And after she said she received a call from Mr Hau on the day that
all these incidences occurred

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#47:1:A>
You must <?> devoids </?> you must not proceed the latter with the
preconception that it must be on the twentieth of November that the events
that she said occurred occurred

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#48:1:A>
It is ultimately for you to say whether those events that she told
you about did occur on the twentieth of November

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#49:1:A>
And unless and until you can say to yourselves that you are sure
that it must be on the twentieth of November that these events happened

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#50:1:A>
If you are not sure that will be a different matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#51:1:A>
You must be acquit

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#52:1:A>
And if you say that you are sure that these events happened on the
twentieth November then still you have to consider the various points that I  ' ve
point it out to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#53:1:A>
As to get <unc> two words </unc> evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#54:1:A>
About how much money she saw

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#55:1:A>
There  ' s nothing to that fact

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#56:1:A>
And there  ' s no evidence that there were no other incidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#57:1:A>
I will not necessarily say that they must be robberies

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#58:1:A>
But incidents involving bundles of Hong Kong currencies or French
franc

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#59:1:A>
Because basically we do know how much money she saw

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#60:1:A>
We don't know

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#61:1:A>
She simply said bundles

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#62:1:A>
How many bundles

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#63:1:A>
No evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#64:1:A>
How much money

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#65:1:A>
Again no evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#66:1:A>
So by hearing that you will have to take these matters into
consideration

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#67:1:A>
Turning now <,> turning back now to her evidence I think it is
right for me to say that it is important from everybody  ' s point of view
first of all to establish the date

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#68:1:A>
And <,> well I might that after the lapse of over thirteen <.> m
</.> months there will be huge difficulty for Ms Ng to recall the exact date

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#69:1:A>
But apparently not

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#70:1:A>
She had utterly no difficulty in telling you that this event
happened on the nineteenth and the twentieth of November

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#71:1:A>
My learned friend suggested to you that uhm her evidence was
supported by the hotel record <,> with respect to my learned friend <unc>
one word </unc> that clearly is not the case

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#72:1:A>
She does not tell you independently off the record that she left
Conrad on the ninth

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#73:1:A>
On the contrary she claimed that she left Conrad on the ninth ninth
after she saw the hotel record for the first time in the witness box

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#74:1:A>
So the hotel record serves no purpose except to tell you the exact
date that she stayed in that hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#75:1:A>
It does not improve her credibility <,> at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#76:1:A>
But what is interesting is that whereas as early as the speech of
January when she was interviewed by a police <,> when she would be in far
better position to know when was that she stayed at the hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#77:1:A>
She kept referring to <,> late November

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#78:1:A>
And and of course you would note from her statements that her
discussion of the events after she left Conrad was totally different from her
discussion in the witness box

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#79:1:A>
And no doubt you would have noticed that in both statements the
eighth of January and the thirty first of March last year she gave identical
discussion that she  ' s spent four successive night at defendant  ' s flat after
which the events happened

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#80:1:A>
And if that is the case members of the jury then the Crown is in
huge difficulty

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#81:1:A>
Because there will be at least six days out

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#82:1:A>
Nine plus five nights equal to twenty

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#83:1:A>
The Crown will be six says out away or before twentieth of November

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#84:1:A>
So what did she do

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#85:1:A>
She was forced by my respectful discussion <unc> one word
</unc> the period between her departure from Conrad and the last visit in
the flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#86:1:A>
Members of the jury it is unimportant from <,> a testified witness
point of view as to the exact dates

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#87:1:A>
It  ' s unimportant whether or not she will be able to recall the
exact date

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#88:1:A>
And in fact she says she is able to recall days then you will have
the greatest doubt about her honesty

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#89:1:A>
Unless there is something to assist her to pinpoint to the exact
date

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#90:1:A>
For example if it happened on the last day of the year or it
happened on one  ' s birthday or it it happens on on Mid Autumn Festival then
you know it goes back to that year  ' s calendar and find out that Mid-Autumn
Festival falls on a particular day

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#91:1:A>
What is important is that one will be able to say yes <,> something
did happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#92:1:A>
Something very strange did happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#93:1:A>
And I remember that it was some days after I left Conrad I remember
I was having back and forth visiting Hau in his in the defendant  ' s flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#94:1:A>
I remember I spent how many nights there

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#95:1:A>
And it I think it will be about ten days after I left Conrad that
this happened events happened

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#96:1:A>
Has she said that to the <.> po </.> police in her statement there
will be no problem

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#97:1:A>
That  ' s not what she said

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#98:1:A>
She maintained that it was in mid November that she checked into
the hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#99:1:A>
And she stayed therefore a certain days

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#100:1:A>
Now this is important here

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#101:1:A>
She made no mistakes about how many days she she stayed at the
hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#102:1:A>
She was totally consistent on this point in all three statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#103:1:A>
Sixth eighth of January thirty first of March

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#104:1:A>
And if she has no difficulty in recalling that she has stayed she  ' s
spent seven days in the hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#105:1:A>
Don't you think that she would likewise have no difficulty in
telling the police that it was about ten days after she left Conrad that
these strange events took place

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#106:1:A>
Well apparently she had huge difficulty

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#107:1:A>
And all that she could say was that it was a Thursday <,> that she
left for the last time

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#108:1:A>
Now members of the jury evidently the police was interested to
pinpoint the date that she went to the flat of last time

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#109:1:A>
And therefore she was asked as to why she was able to recall that
Thursday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#110:1:A>
And her explanation or explanations because there are two
different versions in her two statements was to the effect that Hau Chuen Yau
scolded her for not accompanying him longer

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#111:1:A>
And that is the whole basis of her being able to recall Thursday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#112:1:A>
Because Thursday was mentioned when he scolded her

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#113:1:A>
When she testified last Friday <,> she gave you a totally
different accounts

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#114:1:A>
She told you she did not referred to any Thursday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#115:1:A>
She instead referred to a Friday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#116:1:A>
She was asked on no less than three occasions by my learned friend
as to why she was able to recall that it was a Friday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#117:1:A>
And she mentioned that she was scolded

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#118:1:A>
And in the course of her scolding Friday two AM was mentioned

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#119:1:A>
Members of the jury if you think that that may be a minor
inconsistency then there  ' s another point which has missed

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#120:1:A>
She had been according to her version of the witness statement she
had been staying with Hau in the defendant  ' s flat for four successive <,>
day

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#121:1:A>
And therefore it would make sense would it not <,> for Hau to say
why didn't you <,> spend more time with me

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#122:1:A>
Why did you have to leave on a Thursday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#123:1:A>
Consider her version in the witness box

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#124:1:A>
She did not spend any successive nights there

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#125:1:A>
In fact according to her she went there may be on the tenth may be
on the eleventh and she left that day she went back

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#126:1:A>
And she spent one night

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#127:1:A>
She went away

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#128:1:A>
Two days later she went back

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#129:1:A>
And then she went away

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#130:1:A>
She went back and spent one night

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#131:1:A>
And then she went away

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#132:1:A>
Stayed there for two nights two days

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#133:1:A>
And then on the eighteenth and on the nineteenth she did not spend
the night there

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#134:1:A>
So if that was right then you might be surprised to hear Hau
scolding her for not accompanying him because of her version she was coming
and going

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#135:1:A>
More or less on a daily basis

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#136:1:A>
And there  ' s certainly no basis for Hau to accuse her of leaving
him on a Friday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#137:1:A>
Unless of course she said to Hau that well I  ' m not coming back
anymore

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#138:1:A>
And there  ' s no such evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#139:1:A>
So it is really very <,> tenuous for her to say to you that well I
remember Friday because of I was scolded by Hau Chuen Sum <,> for having left
him at two AM on Friday

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#140:1:A>
And what is more interesting in this

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#141:1:A>
Does she said when she left at two AM on Friday Hau was aware of
it

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#142:1:A>
And Hau never tried to stop her

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#143:1:A>
Do not think that that is very strange

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#144:1:A>
And if you were Hau you let her go

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#145:1:A>
Why would you want to scold her for a day

<ICE-HK:S2A-067#146:1:A>
Few hours later </I>
