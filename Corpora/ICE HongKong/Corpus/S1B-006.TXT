<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-006#1:1:A>
And uhm at the time the opera began uh the story uhm the woman  ' s
<?> host </?> husband the prince has already dead so uh she  ' s now a widow
okay very rich widow

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#2:1:A>
And when and a man uh we  ' re talk uh the man

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#3:1:A>
Let me give them the names uh we give them give uh give names uh the
man is called the <?> Dardino </?> okay <?> Dardino </?> and the woman is
called uh uh <,> uh Madam Madam Madam Madam <unc> one-word </unc> is
something like that or <unc> three words </unc> something <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#4:1:A>
Anyway uh so <?> Dardino </?> is uh in love with uh this uh Madam
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#5:1:A>
Uhm not at a point uh not well actually they were lovers years even
when they were very uh young person okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#6:1:A>
But because uh the they they are woman  ' s guidance marry upon the
prince they were not able to marry okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#7:1:A>
But now the prince die and so they are they are free to marry each
other again okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#8:1:A>
However uh <?> Dardino </?> was not able to propose to uh uh Madam
because uh <,> he was afraid that <,> the woman okay the widow would have
some doubt as to his intension of proposing now because of her uh wealth okay
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#9:1:A>
And uh <,> but this is a a and so you see this is a this is a
pressure doubt doubting her knows of course he knows okay that he loves her
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#10:1:A>
However he is not sure that she <,> believes true that uh he loves
her <,> and not because uh of her money okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#11:1:A>
So there is a a this problem and uh uh well the way uh uh the widow
resolve this problem was to uh declare to <?> Dardino </?> one day that <,>
uh <,> just before uh former husband die uh he made a will stating that if
the event that uh she remarries <,> all her wealth will be taken away

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#12:1:A>
Uh she tells this to <?> Dardino </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#13:1:A>
Now above hearing that <?> Dardino </?> immediately <,> kneel down
and proposes okay <unc> Several words </unc> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#14:1:A>
But is it because uh there will be no uh possibility of doubt
anymore when uh she becomes poor okay and he still proposes to her that
proves that he is not <unc> one-word </unc> her wealth okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#15:1:A>
So immediately uh he proposes <,> and of course uh he was accepted

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#16:1:A>
And then uh <unc> one-word </unc> Madam continue <,> when
my husband die okay he said if I remarries uh if I ever remarry then my
wealth will be taken away and given to the one that I marry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#17:1:A>
So that was the nice way of solving this uh <unc> three words
</unc> dollar

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#18:1:A>
Uhm there are lots of those of problem in real life the wish if
that can be <?> information </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#19:1:A>
The way is the wise the wise clever way to get round the problem
and I think uh Doctor <?> Lui </?> gave you an example of the uh <,> of the
uh <,> insurance <,> uh market way uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#20:1:A>
And wish you have all answer and you all sort of the problem at
worst selection

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#21:1:A>
And uh somehow uh the insurance market have uh has devise uh very
clever method of bypassing those problems

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#22:1:A>
And uh if you study more economic you find out more such uh method
uh not just in insurance it  ' s a <.> buss </.> business field O okay
<unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#23:1:A>
Uhm <,> so uhm <,> I  ' m not sure you you enjoy the Doctor Louis <?>
lesson </?> very much

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#24:1:A>
He is a very good story teller <,> very very good story teller uh
he can go on with hours <,> and uh I I sort of lack that skill I am not a
very good story teller <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#25:1:A>
Anyway uh <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#26:1:A>
So by the way then the the composer of that opera uh is a Hungarian
with a <?> bit </?> Germany uh his name his name was <?> Francs Lehar </?>
<,> <?> Francs Lehar </?> L E H A R and and the music is very good and the
song are very very nice and

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#27:1:A>
So one day if you go library you can check out the the the opera
<?> Francs Lehar </?> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#28:1:A>
Now I just want to add one thing to chapter nineteen <,> uh about
about public goods okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#29:1:A>
These two diagram these are all I want to add in chapter nineteen

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#30:1:A>
Uhm <,> you know what public goods are right I define the also uh
last time or last week

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#31:1:A>
Uh if one forces consumption does not <.> pre </.> uh preclude
others from uh consuming the same product uh then that product we will this
call the <,> public good

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#32:1:A>
Usually it  ' s provided by the government that  ' s because uh of the
<?> executive </?> problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#33:1:A>
If the government doesn't provide it then then uh <,> uh the the
market lack uh lack the market the market if you buy too little type too
little of the good okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#34:1:A>
Because uh no one is willing to to uh uh pay for it

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#35:1:A>
Everyone thinks about uh let the other pay the other cost pay for
it and I enjoy it to sense of it  ' s uh uh non excludable

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#36:1:A>
Now uh the question is <,> if you let the government uh provide the
public good what should be proper level okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#37:1:A>
Uh that  ' s like uh try to find the demand curve for the public good
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#38:1:A>
Uh now for private good any uh good that you <?> cause </?> so many
buyer and buy and consume <,> uh to find the market demand or the demand
curve of all the people in in market

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#39:1:A>
What you do is to look at the individual demand curves and sum up
horizontally right

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#40:1:A>
Uh at any price level you add the quantities demanded and you add
them up then you will get the market demand quantity

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#41:1:A>
Uh this is done at various price level then you get market demand
curve

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#42:1:A>
However for a public good that is not the way to add the uh
individual demands

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#43:1:A>
Instead the uh well public good given individual demands to find
the market or or the overall demand you add them vertically okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#44:1:A>
You add them vertically <,> uh this is because of the following <&>
A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#45:1:A>
Let  ' s say we have these two persons okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#46:1:A>
Uh person one  ' s demand were included here person two demand
included here

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#47:1:A>
Now just look at person one <unc> one-word </unc> okay uh
uh <,> uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#48:1:A>
Remembering that uh when we would discussing uhm the concept of
social uh surplus we first introduce the idea of the maximum willingness to
pay for various units of the good by a person

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#49:1:A>
And we are concluded that uh if you have a <?> map </?> showing the
maximum willingness to pay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#50:1:A>
Of course then that <?> map </?> is is essentially uh that person  ' s
demand curve okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#51:1:A>
So this curve here this curve here shows the maximum willingness to
pay for successive unit of the public good by person one okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#52:1:A>
Uh for instance let  ' s say uh uh if the if the curve uh begins here
okay uh <,> and let say this is uh ten dollars and this is four dollars okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#53:1:A>
Now that would mean for the first unit okay the first unit the
person one is willing to pay ten dollars maximum ten dollars for the first
unit

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#54:1:A>
And the person two is willing to pay a maximum of four dollars for
the first unit okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#55:1:A>
Now since this is a public good <,> if you provide just one unit
that means the two persons together <,> will be willing to pay a maximum of
twenty two dollars for that unit <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#56:1:A>
And that twenty two dollars is the social value okay the so total
social benefit of providing that first unit

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#57:1:A>
You add up the two values again add the two values so if the
government provide the first unit that will create that will create a value
equal to ten plus twelve okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#58:1:A>
Now look at the uh second unit okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#59:1:A>
Let say uh the second unit the cost of value is at eight dollars
okay and the second cost of value is at ten dollars uh if the government
provide it that it will have created the wealth of eight dollars plus ten
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#60:1:A>
Altogether eighteen dollars okay and so on and so forth <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#61:1:A>
So if you <,> add ten to twelve you get twenty here twenty two

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#62:1:A>
If you add eight to ten uh you get a point here is uh eighteen
units high eighteen dollar units high as uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#63:1:A>
So you add these curves horizontally and you get <,> an aggregated
curve which shows the sum of the maximum willingness to pay or the sum of the
values okay of the various units of the good were the two curves sticking
together <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#64:1:A>
It is this uh vertical sum of the two curves that the government
should look at when it <,> wants to determine the appropriate number of unit
of the public good it provides okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#65:1:A>
So let  ' s take this curve here <,,> and put it in this diagram okay
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#66:1:A>
Uh let us draw the marginal cost curve of providing the public good
uh by the government okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#67:1:A>
Now uh <,> let say uh this curve begins at uh twenty two okay and
and marginal cost begins at uh let say five

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#68:1:A>
Obviously the first unit should be produced right

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#69:1:A>
The first unit should be produced because uh it it is produced it
create a wealth uh it create a value of twenty two dollars whereas its cost
is just five dollars okay so this unit should be produced

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#70:1:A>
The second unit should also be produced because uh the second unit
is worth eighteen dollars and uh only cost an additional let say six dollars
okay and so uh all these actually all these unit should be produced <,,>
until uh it arrive at Q star okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#71:1:A>
At Q star the <,> total value of <,> this unit the marginal Q star
uh the last unit produce is equal to the marginal cost the additional cost of
producing it

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#72:1:A>
So there is no social gain at producing that unit or any unit of
the <unc> one-word </unc> Q star anymore okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#73:1:A>
So Q Q star would be the the uh <,> the optimal socially uh optimal
proper level of the public good

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#74:1:A>
So remember uh in uh determine the Q star you need uh marginal cost
providing the public good by the government you also need the aggregated
demand curve for the <,> uh public good which is obtained by summing the
values the vertical height okay vertical height uh measure value you say uh
of the the uh <unc> one-word </unc> of the public good by uh as seen
by the two persons okay you add the main curves vertically in this uh in this
diagram <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#75:1:A>
That is in contrast to uh find the <unc> one-word </unc>
equilibrium of the level uh unless you add it in individual demand curves
horizontally

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#76:1:A>
Uh <,> oh one thing I must emphasize this is solving the uh the
social planner  ' s problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#77:1:A>
This is solving the social optimal <,> in <unc> one-word
</unc> diagram if you draw the demand and supply you  ' re solving with the
market equilibrium okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#78:1:A>
So the two the two solutions are distinct concepts okay here you
thinking of social optimality social efficiency

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#79:1:A>
Here in <unc> one-word </unc> you  ' re try to predict what
the market outcome will be like <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#80:1:A>
So this is the only thing I would add to chapter nineteen and uh I
want you to read that chapter carefully <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#81:1:A>
Uh as I said I would uh be spending most of the time on this uh <,>
this lecture on uh uh <,> topic which are I think is very interesting and <,>
intellectually exciting uh that  ' s the topic on law <unc> one-word
</unc> uhm <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#82:1:A>
There are many uh <,> domains uh <,> under a legal system you have
uh <,> different kinds of laws you have uh <,> laws providing property you
have uh laws providing contracts

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#83:1:A>
Uh you have uh laws governing uh <,> uh <,,> or what what the term
<unc> one-word </unc> no conscious behaviour at

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#84:1:A>
Let say you harm someone else unintentionally okay and that person
sue you okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#85:1:A>
A law uh <,> such a law case call a tort T O R T okay and you have
a body of law court law of torts <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#86:1:A>
If the government uh <unc> one-word </unc> act uh with uh
certain senses and you also have a criminal laws of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#87:1:A>
You have a family law uh you have business law uh you have uh uh
international law and so on and so forth okay at various domains

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#88:1:A>
Uhm <,> I  ' m going to give you examples from uh <?> vary </?>
various examples of uh some of these uh domains of law

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#89:1:A>
And see how economic analysis can go like uh <,> understanding uh
the legal system and how uh sometimes economic analysis can help uh formulate
better laws okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#90:1:A>
Uh <,> there  ' s several principles there are <.> se </.> several
principles uh that that people use in writing laws

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#91:1:A>
One principle was the uh principle of fairs okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#92:1:A>
Uh a law cannot be unfair <,> however uh a lot of times <,>
fairness alone <,> cannot tell you how to write a law <,> uh I can give you
some examples

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#93:1:A>
Uh and it is in this situation that the economic analysis well
would comes very useful okay as extension of <,> of the principle of fairness
in writing laws <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#94:1:A>
Actually this is uh base on a a a true a law case uh which happen
in England <,> about uh two hundred years ago <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#95:1:A>
Can you read that

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#96:1:A>
A hunter in woodiness <?> flushed </?> the wild fox from hiding and
uh <,> with his <?> pack of hounds </?> <,> <unc> two-words </unc>
gave chase just as <?> hand about prounce </?> on the fox it ran across the
path of a bystander who shot and capture it

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#97:1:A>
The hunter sued to recover the dead fox

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#98:1:A>
Now the issue here in involves a uh <,> the following

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#99:1:A>
Uh who should have property right uh to the dead fox <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#100:1:A>
Now uh it belongs to nobody right it it originally belongs to
nobody

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#101:1:A>
Uh it  ' s just a an animal running round the <?> woodlands </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#102:1:A>
However uh <,> there is a law regarding uh uh uh wild property uh
wild animals that is if you can capture it then it  ' s yours okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#103:1:A>
Now the things is said that uh that law is not cover this
situation or the the uh the the uh <,> the uh uh <,> conflict the conflict
situation arises here

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#104:1:A>
Uh one party spends effort time energy and perhaps uh <,> uh risk
uh uh some danger uh in uh try to capture the fox

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#105:1:A>
The other party cannot use them but as a matter of luck that cost
just uh uh at a cost of one bullet uh <,> captured the fox

<ICE-HK:S1B-006#106:1:A>
So the question is uh who which party should uh <,> recover uh
should have ownership of the dead fox okay </I>
