<bold> 1 Scholarship to England </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#2:1>
<bold> I </bold> n the early past of 1946 , the Hong Kong
government commemorated the capitulation of Japan by awarding the Victory
Scholarships , advertised as such , to local students , with no spring
attached , to further their studies at various universities in the United
Kingdom .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#3:1>
There were many applicants for the award , from whom seven were
eventually chosen to share the five scholarships .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#4:1>
I was one of the lucky seven , So was my younger brother Brain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#5:1>
In those days , air travel was far less common than now .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#6:1>
Even travel by sea was severely restricted because of the large number
of ships sunk during the war .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#7:1>
It was not until late in August that year that the SS Menelaus , a
cargo boat ploughing the South China seas , was available to take us to
Singapore , where , after a further considerable delay and much red tape , we
finally set sail for England on board the troopship SS Britannic arriving in
Liverpool only in the middle of October . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#8:1>
Of the seven scholarship students from Hong Kong , three were
admitted into London University , one was admitted into Leeds University ,
and one into Manchester University .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#9:1>
I was accepted by Merton College , Oxford to read Politics ,
Philosophy and Economics , while my younger brother Brain gained admission
into Pembroke College , Cambridge to read Economics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#10:1>
The Michaelmas term had already commenced when Brain and I finally
arrived at and settled into our respective colleges .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#11:1>
Brain had taken a course in Economics as an undergraduate at Lingnan
University in China during the war .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#12:1>
It was only natural that he should want to carry on with the study of
Economics at Pembroke , I chose PPE for totally different reasons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#13:1>
In point of fact , on the eve of departure from Hong Kong , my
father had urged me to read law and qualify as a barrister .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#14:1>
However , I had other ideas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#15:1>
The law and the legal profession , especially the Bar , were in those
days altogether unknown and alien to me , and , indeed , to most of the
Chinese population in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#16:1>
Until then neither I nor any other member of my family was aware that
anyone we knew had made a success of practising at the local Bar .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#17:1>
Besides , I had spent several years in China during the war , had
witnessed the pitiful ignorance and poverty in most parts of the mainland ,
and had pledged that I would return to do what little I could to better the
lot of my people after receiving my education abroad .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#18:1>
In the circumstances I felt almost justified in turning a deaf ear to
my father  ' s advice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#19:1>
If anyone were to have told me then that I would eventually end
up reading law at Lincolin  ' s Inn in London and return to practise law in the
courts of Hong Kong , I would probably have laughed it off as sheer fantasy
on their part .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#20:1>
I could hardly be expected to know that ere long subsequent events in
China would force upon me a different outlook for the future , that I would
indeed as a result switch to studying and practising law , and be the first
one in the family to fulfil his parent  ' s dear wish . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#21:1>
However , most of this later . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#22:1>
<bold> 2 A Seven Child </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#23:1>
I was born on 22 August 1922 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#24:1>
Not that I know anything about it , other than that my birth
certificate says so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#25:1>
My parents had four sons and seven daughters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#26:1>
I was their third son and seventh child .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#27:1>
My father was himself the seventh child of his parents .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#28:1>
The Chinese believe that the seventh child of a seventh child is
specially blessed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#29:1>
Over the years , I have certainly had a great measure of good fortune
than most of the people I know . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#30:1>
My first clear recollections as a child came with Nos . 15-17
Upper Shelley Street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#31:1>
Until the end of the last war , these consisted of two adjoining
two-storey twin houses into which my family had moved when I was less than
six years old .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#32:1>
Shelly Street is divided into two sections .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#33:1>
Lower Shelley Street adjoins Hollywood Road at one end and Caine Road
at the other .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#34:1>
Upper Shelley Street is a street sloping walkway which is less than
twenty feet wide , and about two hundred yards long , bounded at the top by
Mosque Street , and at the bottom by Caine Road , with residential houses
lining both sides of the street almost all the way with the exception of a
large vegetable garden fenced by walls facing houses Nos . 15-17 directly
across the walkway .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#35:1>
Immediately past the vegetable garden is the entrance to a Muslim
mosque with surrounding walls which take up the rest of that side of the
walkway right up to Mosque Street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#36:1>
Walking up Shelley Street from Caine Road , one would , after some
fifty yards , come to an opening on the right which leads into Prince  ' s
Terrace . Lying another fifty yards further up and beyond this opening on the
right would be Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley Street . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#37:1>
The majority of the houses in this area are extremely close to or
otherwise actually adjoining one another .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#38:1>
In those days Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley Street had the unique
distinction in the whole of that area of being able to boast of a long strip
of verandah some three to four feet wide overhanging the walkway from the
first floor and extending continuously over the entire frontage of the two
houses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#39:1>
This overlooked not only the whole length of Shelley Street , but
also a vast area in the vicinity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#40:1>
Standing on this verandah one could even sight a part of the harbour
and something of Kowloon for a long way beyond .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#41:1>
When lined with pots of multi-coloured flowers , this unusual
structural addition to the property made a very attractive sight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#42:1>
Very regrettably this historic residence of my family was sold in the
1950s , and has since been replaced by a mundane building of multiple storeys
with no verandah or view whatever . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#43:1>
It was at this address that I grew up together with my brothers
Ping Tsung and Brain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#44:1>
Shortly after the family moved into Shelly Street , my eldest broth
Pak Chuen left for England and was soon joined by my eldest sister Sheung
Woon .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#45:1>
My two other elder sisters Josephine and Margaret were then already
attending school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#46:1>
My two younger sisters Winnie and Rosalind came respectively into
this world at Shelley Street in 1929 and 1931 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#47:1>
Yet another two sisters , one older and one younger than I , had died
in their infancy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#48:1>
My father was a Senior Inspector of Schools employed by the Hong Kong
government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#49:1>
At dinner he frequently told us fascinating stories about our
literary giants and historic heroes which were unforgettable lessons in
themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#50:1>
On Sundays , we would more often than not be taken to watch either a
cinema film or a soccer match , to be followed by a meal in town in one of
our favourite restaurants .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#51:1>
Those were overwhelmingly happy years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#52:1>
My brother Ping Tsung , who passed away in February , 1996 , was
one and a half years older than I .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#53:1>
Together we learnt our ABCs as well as our first Chinese characters
at Nos. 15-17 Shelley Street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#54:1>
A Eurasian woman surnamed Shum was engaged to teach us English and
arithmetic , while a Chinese male tutor surnamed Li taught us Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#55:1>
Being much cleverer than I , Ping Tsung was naturally the teacher  ' s
favourite .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#56:1>
It did not explain , though , why Miss Shum should constantly find
fault with me , frequently for no reason whatever .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#57:1>
Whenever she picked on me unfairly , Ping Tsung would rally to my
side , and do his utmost to console and comfort me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#58:1>
Although this did not always suffice to pacify my injured ego and
outraged sense of justice , an intimate comradeship grew up between us as a
result which continued right through our school and university days as well
as during and after the war . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#59:1>
My brother Brain is two years younger than myself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#60:1>
He too received his initial education at Nos . 15-17 Upper Shelley
Street , save that he was given separate lessons from Ping Tsung and myself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#61:1>
The three of us regularly played together when we were not at work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#62:1>
We often pretended to divide the family residence into three separate
kingdoms , and each of us would occupy one of them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#63:1>
We would then play hide-and-seek fighting against one another as
kings defending our respective realms . No . 15 and No . 17 Shelley Street in
those days each had a winding staircase led from the ground floor to a common
dinning room straddling the first floor of both houses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#64:1>
A third smaller winding staircase led from the kitchen , the
servants ' quarters , and an open yard at the rear of the ground floor of both
houses to a narrow corridor serving only the first floor of No . 15 , ending
likewise in the common dining room .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#65:1>
This intriguing layout offered ideal opportunities for our game .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#66:1>
Although Ping Tsung won most of out imaginary combats , Brain and I
enjoyed nonetheless the sheer excitement of dashing up and down the several
staircase trying to outmanoeuvre , outwit and outguess one another as if we
were seasoned strategists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#67:1>
At the beginning of 1932 , my father decided that the time had
come for his three younger sons to go to school .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#68:1>
Accordingly , he took us to see the headmaster of Wah Yan College ,
then situated at No . 2 Robinson Road . Robinson Road adjoins the east end of
Mosque Street and is no more than a stone  ' s throw from Shelley Street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#69:1>
The school was then divided into eight grades .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#70:1>
The highest grade was class 1 which was the matriculation class .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#71:1>
The lowest class was class 8 . Ping Tsung and I were put into class 7
while Brain was put into class .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#72:1>
Thus began my education at Wah Yan College .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#73:1>
I was then nine years old . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#74:1>
<bold> 3 Wah Yan College and the Irish Jesuits </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#75:1>
Walking every morning to Wah Yan and back again in the afternoon
was not only good exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#76:1>
As I carried my books daily up Shelley Street across and beyond
Mosque Street into Robinson Road , I felt sheer be pride in being able to
fend for myself at last , and no longer needing to be constantly watched over
by my parents .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#77:1>
Sharing a classroom with some forty other students was also a new and
pleasurable experience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#78:1>
Hitherto attending classes at home with Ping Tsung alone had
invariably given me an inferiority complex .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#79:1>
The discovery that not a few of the other students were not much
cleverer than I , if at all , was in itself both comforting and reassuring .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#80:1>
Besides , being the youngest member of my class , and more than
articulate in expressing myself , I enjoyed more immediate attention from the
teaches at Wah Yan than Miss Shum and Mr Li had ever shown me at home .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#81:1>
This gave me no small measure of a newly acquired confidence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#82:1>
Wah Yan College was founded by Mr Peter Tsui in 1919 in Hollywood
Road with no more than a handful pupils at its inception .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#83:1>
However the number of its students and classes grew steadily over the
years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#84:1>
In 1921 , it moved into Nos . 2 Robinson Road .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#85:1>
In 1922 , it became a grant-in-aid secondary school with more than
one hundred students , after which its complement of students and classes
increased further from year to year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#86:1>
In 1931 , it was sold to the Society of Jesus from Dublin , Ireland ,
and was in due course taken over by the representatives of that religious
order .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#87:1>
Under the expert supervision and management of the Irish Jesuits ,
Wah Yan College continued to expand and flourish in the years which followed
, and had long since won recognition as one of the best-run and most
successful local secondary schools . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#88:1>
In 1932 , when admission into Wah Yan was sought by my sought by
my father for Ping Tsung , Brian , and myself , it was Fr Gallagher who
received , interviewed , and admitted us .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#89:1>
Fr Gallagher was the first Irish Jesuit headmaster of Wah Yan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#90:1>
He was a perpetually cheerful and affable man , whose somewhat stern
looks belied his gentle and selfess inner nature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#91:1>
At first we could not help feeling a little afraid of him , but his
overflowing friendliness quickly put us at our ease .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#92:1>
It did not take us long to discover that since becoming headmaster ,
he had readily won over the love and respect of all the teaches , staff , and
students alike of the school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-010#93:1>
I owe a special debt of gratitude to Rev Fr D . Donnelly SJ who
taught me mathematics in 1936 , 1937 , and 1938 in Wah Yan College .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#94:1>
With Miss Shum as my former teacher , I had had no end of problems
with my arithmetic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#95:1>
This continued initially in Wah Yan throughout 1932 , 1933 , 1934 and
1935 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-010#96:1>
I experienced a similar difficult , although to a lesser degree ,
with algebra , geometry and trigonometry , when I was first taught those
subjects in 1934 and 1935 . </p>
