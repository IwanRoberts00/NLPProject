Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X2:1:Z>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Wah has banned the Falun Gong movement as
an evil cult

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X3:1:Z>
Is Beijing putting pressure on the SAR government to curb the group

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X4:1:Z>
What should Hong Kong do

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X5:1:Z>
With us to discuss these issues are Dr Raymond Wu Hong Kong Deputy
to the National People  ' s Congress and Mr Martin Lee Chairman of the
Democratic Party </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#6:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X7:1:Z>
Gentlemen welcome

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X8:1:Z>
Martin you have said that the Fulun Gong uh issue is <?> made a
break </?> for one county two systems

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X9:1:Z>
Why do you think is that serious </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#10:1:A>
Because this may be the first time since the year
establishment of the SAR that the central government and the Hong Kong
government do not agree on the way that the Fulun Gong issue should be
handled

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#11:1:A>
And so I I  ' ve been calling them acid test for one country and two
system

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X12:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#13:1:A>
Now up to now <?> any </?> senior government servant who spoke
including uh Mrs Yip had had said that these people have not broken the law
in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X14:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#15:1:A>
Now but if as a result of uh further pressure from Beijing the
Hong Kong government then begin to do something about these people whether to
have them arrested or have the organization deregistered and so on then the
whole world will know well this not quite one country two systems <{> <[> is
it </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X16:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X17:1:Z>
Raymond do you agree that the way China and Hong Kong handle this
issue will determine whether Hong Kong actually enjoys uh a high degree of
autonomy uh under one country two systems </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#18:1:B>
I think I  ' d like to respond to what Martin has said

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#19:1:B>
One country two system will will will will not be so easy to break
that the <unc> one word </unc> undergone a lot of tests and even <{>
<[> Martin </[> himself has said several times that the the the the one
country two systems are breaking you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#20:1:B>
But I think uh <.> th </.> this issue the Falun Gong issue uh posts
a a test onto the Hong Kong how to really to implement one country two system

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#21:1:B>
And then as far as so far I think uh uh uh disregarding all the
words that might be harsh uhm I think every party is uh keeping one county
two system well you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#22:1:B>
Because nobody has ever utter anything that Falun Gong is illegal
in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X23:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X24:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#25:1:B>
It  ' s still keeping because Hong Kong we don't have a legal
definition for cult you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#26:1:B>
Uh what uh uh uh <.> th </.> the Secretary Bureau Secretary uhm Yip
said or uh Ms Mrs <?> Sung </?> said is just as a a a kind of uhm perhaps you
can call it a warning

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#27:1:B>
That kind of thing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X28:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#29:1:B>
Really no action has been taken

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#30:1:B>
And even you look at the spokesman for central government all these
people all their works are quite in line with what like one one country two
system

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#31:1:B>
But anything if anything happen further which nobody would know <{>
<[> you </[> see there are provisions in the Basic Law you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#32:1:B>
You can't you you you can't say that the the the uh implementation
of some of the articles uh in the Basic Law means one country two system

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#33:1:B>
It  ' s <.> bro </.> it  ' s broken you see

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X34:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X35:1:Z>
<{> <[> <.> Wh </.> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#36:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> if if these people are not breaking the law
why should they even be warned

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#37:1:A>
<{> <[> <?> Uh </?> </[> why should you and I be warned <{> <[> if
we  ' re we  ' re not breaking the law </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#38:1:B>
<[> Why </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#39:1:B>
<[> Why why why should you will be </[> </{> warned

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#40:1:B>
Why should we be be warned you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#41:1:B>
<{> <[> I think </[> I think warning is is is good thing

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#42:1:A>
<[> <unc> one-word </unc> <.> com </.> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#43:1:A>
Well you mean you  ' d like to be warned everyday that you better be
careful <{> <[> and so on </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#44:1:B>
<[> I don't </[> </{> mind

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#45:1:A>
Well this <{> <[> this is a <.> fun </.> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#46:1:B>
<[> I don't </[> </{> mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#47:1:B>
I don't mind

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#48:1:A>
This is a funny of enjoying your freedom I have to say

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#49:1:B>
<{> <[> No </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X50:1:Z>
<[> Well </[> </{> uh if I <{> <[> may if <,> if </[> I may break
in uh Raymond I notice that you had a meeting with uh some Falun Gong people
uh Friday </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#51:1:B>
<[> I think I think we want </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#52:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X53:1:Z>
And according to the newspapers uh Saturday uh you had uh warned
the Falun Gong <{> <[> people </[> </X>

<$B > 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#54:1:B>
<[> Not </[> </{> not warning <{> <[> uh just is a general
warning </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X55:1:Z>
<[> Uh I  ' m <unc> a few words </unc> </[> </{> all right
all right

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X56:1:Z>
You had said </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#57:1:B>
I think I think <{> <[> we we  ' ve </[> been uh sort of our our
<.> m </.> our our minds that have been really too suspicious too too too
sceptical <{> <[> everything </[> sort of uh <{> <[> to the extreme I would
say </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X58:1:Z>
<[> You had said </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X59:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X60:1:Z>
<[> All right uh Raymond uh </[> </{> uh according to the
newspaper you had said that one country two systems would be undermined uh
that that it could be undermined and it would be detrimental for Hong Kong
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#61:1:B>
Could be undermined <{> <[> <,> you see </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X62:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{> yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X63:1:Z>
Now uh how would one country two systems be undermined </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#64:1:B>
Uhm <,> I think if Falun Gong people try to push the test to
the limit <{> <[> <,> and </[> try to test the limit uh of one country two
system

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X65:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X66:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#67:1:B>
You see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#68:1:B>
Uhm then I think there is a danger

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X69:1:Z>
But that  ' s not undermining it <{> <[> that  ' s </[> just telling
what the limits are

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X70:1:Z>
Well the limits are there aren't they </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#71:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#72:1:B>
Uh I think the limit is still not clear

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X73:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#74:1:B>
There  ' s <.> l </.> a lot of room

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#75:1:B>
That  ' s what I I what what what my what my opinion is that the
Article twenty three should be left until later date when the political
environment is more harmonious

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#76:1:B>
The central government the Hong Kong relationship are are are
better

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X77:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#78:1:B>
Uh then I think it would be the time to uh legislate the
Article twenty three you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#79:1:B>
But if <,> if that  ' s has happened to push <,> whichever party

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X80:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#81:1:B>
To take sort of to take action to implement certain
legislation of the laws in order to keep law in order for Hong Kong as well
as uh a uh uh as mainland China then that would be a threat

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X82:1:Z>
Uh <{> <[> Martin </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#83:1:A>
<[> Do I </[> </{> do I understand correctly Raymond are you
saying that if the Falun Gong people if they keep on pushing uh their freedom
to the limit that might antagonize the central government <{> <[> to such an
</[> extent <{> <[> <,> </[> that <{> <[> it would </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#84:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#85:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#86:1:B>
<[> That might </[> </{> endanger <{> <[> the </[> national <{> <[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#87:1:A>
<[> Uh it would </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#88:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#89:1:A>
Uh it was <{> <[> then </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#90:1:B>
<[> You see </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#91:1:A>
It would then cause the Hong Kong government to enact a law
<{> <[> which </[> is unduly harsh

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#92:1:A>
And and under Article twenty three <{> <[> of the </[> Basic Law
<{> <[> is </[> thereby

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#93:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#94:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#95:1:B>
<[> Yah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#96:1:B>
Thereby

<[> Uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#100:1:B>
<[> It  ' s </[> </{> not those things one country two it  ' s to

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#101:1:B>
And Article twenty three is so harsh that a lot of people in Hong

<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<[> Well </[> </{>

<[> Now </[> </{> it seems to me seems to me that <{> <[> if </[>

<[> You </[> </{> see the logic

No <{> <[> no I I don't </[> follow the logic </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X107:1:Z>
Actually I I don't think Faulun Gong poses us a threat one
country two <{> <[> systems </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X108:1:Z>
If if the central government exercises its restrains there is no

<[> <?> No you don't </?> <unc> a few words </unc>
</[> </{>

Uhm

<{> <[> But </[> if the central government allows the Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X258:1:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re discussing the Falun Gong movement in Hong

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X259:1:Z>
Now Raymond uh as you know the National People  ' s Congress will

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#260:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#261:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X262:1:Z>
And you  ' ll be attending </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#263:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X264:1:Z>
Uh will you or other Hong Kong deputies bring up the Falun Gong
issue </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#265:1:B>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X266:1:Z>
You you have no <{> <[> <?> intention </?> </[> to do that </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#267:1:B>
<[> I personally </[> </{> have no intention but I  ' ll I  ' ll
participate in the discussion

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X268:1:Z>
Uh <{> <[> huh </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#269:1:B>
<[> I </[> </{> think Falun Gong to my mind is as I said is a
good test for one country two system

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X270:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#271:1:B>
And it could demonstrate that provided that there are few
provisions that must make that Falun Gong in Hong Kong just practice Falun
Gong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X272:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#273:1:B>
Without trying to attempt as I have sort of uh uh uh uh
reminder you see

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X274:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#275:1:B>
Because once of course they have their their their their
objective you see uh uh of doing all this protest and so on you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#276:1:B>
But the reality is that once Falun Gong has been as you  ' ve said
banned by the central government <{> <[> as </[> cult

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X277:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X278:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#279:1:B>
That not Mr Tung Chee Wah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X280:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#281:1:B>
In fact Mr Tung Chee Wah never try to ban you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#282:1:B>
He has just uh make a statement of his personally views like that
you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#283:1:B>
Uh <,> then it would be difficult to revert

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X284:1:Z>
Now uh what <{> <[> I know </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#285:1:B>
<[> So I think </[> </{> it it will take time

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#286:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#287:1:B>
<[> For for </[> </{> Falun Gong people to just sort of uh uh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#289:1:A>
<[> Would </[> </{> would you at least tell uh the officials

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#295:1:A>
What  ' s wrong

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#296:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#304:1:B>
Falun Gong Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#305:1:B>

<[> They don't need need to tell </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#313:1:B>
Of course they know

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#314:1:B>
From the spokesman  ' s words they never said Falun Gong has broken
the law

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#315:1:B>
Perhaps you  ' ve reacted overreacted to to that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#316:1:A>
All right then perhaps you will tell them they don't have to
worry about Falun Gong in Hong Kong

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#317:1:B>
Of course they worry

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-038#318:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X319:1:Z>
Uh let me get back to the NPC uh meeting next month

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X324:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1B-038#X325:1:Z>
Uh you remember that in nineteen ninety eight uh President Jiang

<.> Judg </.> judging from Mr Jiang Zemin  ' s point of view I
