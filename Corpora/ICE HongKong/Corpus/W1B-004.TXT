Dear Susanne ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#3:1>
How  ' re you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#4:1>
I hope you won't forget me , will you?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#5:1>
If you do forget me , let me introduce myself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#6:1>
We were the classmate in Wa Ying College ... and so on .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#7:1>
Ha ! Ha!

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#8:1>
I  ' m not bad now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#9:1>
Although I  ' ve been here for half year , I still not satisfied
everything in here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#10:1>
I don't know when I can adapt my life in here .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#11:1>
But if I stay in H.K. , I can't obtain 2 things from my father .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#12:1>
One is the piano , another one is the computer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#13:1>
Piano is <-> a </-> <+> an </+> upright one , the color is black , it  ' s
been polished .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#14:1>
Except it is made in Korea , all the materials and equipments are
come from U.S.A. .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#15:1>
The piano &obrack; not the film &cbrack; is made from wood ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#16:1>
I can't find any plastic from it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#17:1>
Maybe it  ' s the reason why it is so loud and the pitch is thick
&ampersand; low .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#18:1>
About the computer , it  ' s the most messy stuff that I never have .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#19:1>
The brand is Ambra which company is IBM .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#20:1>
Epson is not popular in America ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#21:1>
people don't know it completely .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#22:1>
Maybe I seldom touch the computer , I am always in trouble when I am
going to type a good copy at the night before I hand it in .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#23:1>
Sometimes it deletes all my assignment when I press a button .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#24:1>
So , I  ' m used to save when I finish a paragraph .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#25:1>
Do you know if it wastes the bytes for putting so many saves in it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#26:1>
The Ink-jet printer is as trouble as the computer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#27:1>
Its company is also IBM .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#28:1>
It is a color printer , but it  ' s now out of order .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#29:1>
I can only print everything in black and white Instead of color
printing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#30:1>
It annoys me so much !

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#31:1>
So , I  ' ve to practise it until I get used to it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#32:1>
Next time , I hope I can write a letter in Chinese to you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#33:1>
Canada  ' s education system isn't so good as I think .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#34:1>
People usually think that it  ' s less pressure than H.K. , but I think
it  ' s the opposite .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#35:1>
Canada government raises the standard requirements for entering
universities .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#36:1>
Students have to get over 70&percent; marks in each subject for
applying to them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#37:1>
When I was in H.K. , I heard that the Math levels of Canadian were no
good .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#38:1>
But , the school boards point out this problem and enforce students
to study Math well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#39:1>
Basically , students have to get over 70&percent; in 2 Math credits
before applying to any further education .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#40:1>
I think if I continue to study in H.K. , I will be much lucky .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#41:1>
I haven't studied Math for 2 years , and the Math I study is the same
level as Additional Math in HKCEE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#42:1>
I got an E in general Math , how can I get an excellent result in A.
Math ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#43:1>
Can you give me some hints for studying Math ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#44:1>
Many Chinese students take Math courses because they can avoid
subjective marking like language courses .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#45:1>
I haven't had any potential in Math , even I have no interest in it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#46:1>
About the other courses , they are basically English-oriented , so
the given marks are subjective .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#47:1>
I  ' ll finish my secondary education at 1996 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#48:1>
It  ' s so late as I want to learn the other things at school , because
the school fee is paid through property tax which families have to pay for
where they live .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#49:1>
It means that only colleges or universities students have to pay
extra tuition fees .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#50:1>
I suppose I can't enter into university , but I  ' m sure I can be a
college student as its requirements are lower . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#51:1>
Some English spoken people are good that they listen to the
conversations of English as a Second Language people carefully .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#52:1>
However , most native people in Canada lose their patience in helping
immigrants .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#53:1>
They think that all people in the world should see English as first
language .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#54:1>
I know this as my regular English classmates complain this when they  ' re
tutoring ESL students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#55:1>
I feel insulted that they have these minds , I  ' m lucky that I don't
need to take ESL course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#56:1>
I regret to come here , the people in here are no good except some
old white people would show their gentleness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#57:1>
Racism , transportation and expenditures are the things I can't
bear in Canada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#58:1>
It  ' s lucky for you to study in H.K. as you can always express your
feelings in Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#59:1>
If I speak in Cantonese in my lesson with the H.K. classmates , I
feel I  ' m so lucky to have such Chinese classmates .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#60:1>
Transportation fares in Canada are so high in here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#61:1>
For example , all bus fares cost HK&dollar;12 <-> whether </-> <+>
wherever </+> you go .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#62:1>
The starting fare for taxi bill is HK&dollar;48 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#63:1>
Suppose you live in Tokwawan , you take a taxi from the airport , it
costs you HK&dollar;150 to go home .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#64:1>
For expenditure , the things you buy in HK are double or triple
pricing in here , and each item has to pay 15&percent; for sales tax .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#65:1>
Can you think how expensive they are ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#66:1>
I spend my weekends in doing housework and my homework .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#67:1>
Houseworks include washing dishes , clothes , sweeping dust ,
cleaning upstair carpet , etc ...

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#68:1>
I don't know why I  ' ve so many homeworks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#69:1>
For Math , I have 60 questions each week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#70:1>
For Eng , I  ' ve to do a project on studying novels and research for a
topic .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#71:1>
Each student is assigned different topic .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#72:1>
My topic is Ecology this time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#73:1>
If you have any materials about my topic , such as articles ,
magazines , would you please send them to me ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#74:1>
If not , just forget it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#75:1>
For Music , I  ' ve to complete 2 projects within 4 months .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#76:1>
About tests and exams , each subject has at least a test each week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#77:1>
For Math , the highest record is that I had a chapter test on Monday
and I had an exam for 4 chapters on Friday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#78:1>
The teacher finished chapter 4 on Thursday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#79:1>
I  ' ve no time to practise the exercises .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#80:1>
For Music , the class has no Chinese student but me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#81:1>
The teacher is racism that he always says my diction for singing
English song is not as good as the other students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#82:1>
At first , I believe in him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#83:1>
But , I still can't get high mark in a singing test on other language
, even I sing Cantonese song .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#84:1>
On the evaluation sheet , every condition is stated either excellent
or good .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#85:1>
Or I  ' m a Chinese , the other students get higher marks even they
sing non-English song badly , such as they  ' ve pauses in uncertain areas or
they sing out of tone .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#86:1>
I regret I take Music , I believe my counsellor wrongly that I can
learn how to play piano .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#87:1>
When I know that it  ' s only for vocal , It  ' s impossible for me to
change the course as he  ' s so lazy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#88:1>
If my surname isn't start with <mention> L </mention> , I won't be a
student under the control of this famous lazy man . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#89:1>
&ldquo; Do you love Canada ? &ldquo;

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#90:1>
If you ask me this question , I  ' d better answer &ldquuo; I love HK !
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#91:1>
Canadian are greedy that they steal my ink pen that is my birthday
gift from my new boyfriend , of course , not Tam Kwok Kwong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#92:1>
I lost it in the School Music Room .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#93:1>
They  ' re jealous that Hong Kong people have brought so much money
here and we usually spend it without deep consideration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#94:1>
Anyway , I must come back H.K. after I finish high school
education .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#95:1>
I miss H.K. so much , including you and everything .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#96:1>
H.K. is the place where I was born , it belongs to me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#97:1>
But , I  ' m afraid of Daya Bay nuclear power station ...

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#98:1>
OK , we  ' ll meet either you come here or I go back H.K. .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#99:1>
As I have a chance to see you guys again , I won't cry anymore as I  ' ve
been here for the first 2 months because of loneliness .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#100:1>
The people in here can't be good friends , they won't keep your
secret , they only enjoy playing with you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#101:1>
No foreigners would be immigrants  '  friends in my school , maybe
they think we don't need each other as we can't tell them our ideas in
English fluently , or they think that we can group ourselves who come from
our original countries . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#102:1>
Mississauga is the area where is located at the west of downtown
Toronto.

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#103:1>
Do you continue your study in university or go to work ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#104:1>
Do you obtain a good result in HKAL ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#105:1>
What grades have you got ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#106:1>
I think you can get a pass in it , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#107:1>
Tell me about your recent condition in your reply letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#108:1>
Write back soon . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#109:1>
Best wishes

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#110:1>
Love ,

Athena <O> two-Chinese-characters </O> </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#112:2>
Emily ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#113:2>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#114:2>
I must say sorry to you first for writing to you so late .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#115:2>
I have been very busy in this semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#116:2>
I know that it should not be an excuse , <del> you </del> but I
think you will forgive me , OK ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#117:2>
Let  ' s talk about studying ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#118:2>
you may wonder why I said that it was a hard time for me in this
semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#119:2>
The reason is that there were many assignments to do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#120:2>
You know that I have chosen English as my major and there are two
essays to be done for each Eng. course ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#121:2>
it means that I should do many essays in one semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#122:2>
But I do not regret for choosing Eng. instead of Geog. because I am
not suitable to study Geog .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#123:2>
It is necessary to have many field trips/camps in studying Geog. ,
always <O> four-Chinese-characters </O> , it  ' s too dangerous .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#124:2>
So , it is better to take Eng. as it <O> several-Chinese- characters
</O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#125:2>
Do you agree ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#126:2>
I am not as lucky as you , because you can take what you like .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#127:2>
I am also interested in studying Marketing or Management as I think
that they are more practical .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#128:2>
It will be helpful to develop future career .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#129:2>
As I study Eng. , many people ask me if I will be a teacher .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#130:2>
It makes me always explaining that I am not going to do so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#131:2>
Have you <del> adople </del> adapted to the new life in Montreal ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#132:2>
How do you feel about this place ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#133:2>
I only know that it is very cold in winter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#134:2>
But I think that it should be a nice place to live because many
people say that it has a comfortable environment .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#135:2>
How do you feel when it is snowing ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#136:2>
I want to have a white winter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#137:2>
I nearly forget to congratulate you on having transferred to the
Faculty of Commerce &ampersand; Administration studying Marketing
successfully .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#138:2>
Do you have any celebration ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#139:2>
Some people said that lives in Canada are boring , is it true ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#140:2>
What will you do in your leisure time ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#141:2>
What kinds of entertainment do you have ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#142:2>
I know there is a kind of entertainment that can't be found in HK ,
that is skiing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#143:2>
Have you tried to play this game ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#144:2>
I think it will be very exciting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#145:2>
Moreover , it will be easy for you to handle as you have <O>
five-Chinese-characters </O> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#146:2>
How about studying in Canada ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#147:2>
I am most interested in this aspect because my sister may choose to
further her education in Canada after the matriculation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#148:2>
Would you give me any suggestion ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#149:2>
Some people say that studying in Canada is much easier than in HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#150:2>
Students always have good results , either grade A or B .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#151:2>
So one will have greater satisfaction from studying in Canada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#152:2>
However , I don't want my sister to go to Canada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#153:2>
She may not know how to take care of herself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#154:2>
In HK , every family member will take care of her , so , it may be
difficult for her to adapt to a new life independently .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#155:2>
Furthermore , there are more universities/colleges which offer
degree courses in HK than before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#156:2>
If she can't study in HK , this means that her exam. results are bad
, <O> three-Chinese-characters </O> , it is necessary to wait until her exam.
results issued . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#157:2>
Do you remember our U. life in year 1 ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#158:2>
We always had lunch together with Kitty , Patricia , He-man
&ampersand; Jenny .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#159:2>
The reason may be that we all studied Geog. , so we felt close with
each other .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#160:2>
But in year 2 , Miranda &ampersand; you had left HK , the others
studied Geog . as major while I studied Eng. , so we had had no gathering of
all of us for a long time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#161:2>
I really miss the time when we were <O> arrow </O> studying together .
<O> one-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#162:2>
Have you made many new friends in Canada ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#163:2>
Are the people nice there ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#164:2>
Are your friends mainly Chinese or Canadians ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#165:2>
Making foreign friends means having more cultural interaction , and
more opportunities to practise Eng .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#166:2>
Is your Eng. much better now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#167:2>
But I wonder there is any problem of racial discrimination ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#168:2>
It may be one of the problems encountered by people who move into
<O> one-character </O> a new place . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#169:2>
You told me last time that you were learning driving .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#170:2>
What is the progress now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#171:2>
Have you got the licence ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#172:2>
You said that driving is easy for you , did you exaggerate the fact ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#173:2>
Knowing how to drive is necessary in Canada , otherwise it is
extremely inconvenient to go elsewhere .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#174:2>
My cousins in Vancouver have already got driving licence .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#175:2>
It makes me feel interested in learning to drive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#176:2>
But I don't know whether I should learn now or after I graduated .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#177:2>
It will be difficult to spare time having lessons if one is working .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#178:2>
But I have no plan to buy a car in the near future , then , I may
forget what I have learned when I decide to buy a car a few years later <O>
five-Chinese-characters-in-brackets </O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#179:2>
So , I am in a dilemma .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#180:2>
Would you give me advice ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#181:2>
During the last holiday , Patricia , He-man &ampersand; Jenny
and I went to Ocean Park .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#182:2>
The games are very exciting and I always screamed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#183:2>
&obrack; <O> three-Chinese-characters </O> high ! &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#184:2>
We have also had a barbecue before . <O> several-Chinese-characters
</O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#185:2>
You know you are talkative &ampersand; provide many topics for us .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#186:2>
Emily , you said that you had frighten 2 boys .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#187:2>
What was the cause ? <O> several-Chinese-characters </O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#188:2>
But from your letters , I found that you had become more mature .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#189:2>
I think it is very natural as people will change over time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#190:2>
I wonder how will you become when you return to HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#191:2>
It may surprise <-> may </-> <+> many </+> people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-004#192:2>
Have you written to Kitty recently ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#193:2>
Although I haven't always seen her , I know that she is not happy as
somebody told me that she had argument with her tutor .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#194:2>
She is worried about her performance for <del> this </del> that
course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#195:2>
I have told her that tutors will not concentrate only on tutorial
performance , but also evaluate one  ' s assignments &ampersand; examination
performance .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#196:2>
I also told her of my similar experience as her in year 1 , but I
found that the tutor was fair in giving marks for my essays &ampersand; I
have satisfactory results for that course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#197:2>
I hope she would not be affected too much by this matter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#198:2>
You should write more to her .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#199:2>
I think it would help .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#200:2>
Sometimes I found myself <O> three-Chinese-characters </O> , because
I have ignored my friends , especially those I have made during my primary
&ampersand; secondary education .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#201:2>
Some of them have once been my best friends , but now I don't even
know whether they are studying or working . <O> several-Chinese-characters

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#202:2>
I tell myself that I should write more letters to them in order to
maintain our friendships . </p>

Do you have any plan to visit other parts of Canada ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#204:2>
I am eager to go to Vancouver to visit my relatives there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#205:2>
This plan may be realized in summer vacation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#206:2>
But I don't know if I will go to Montreal .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#207:2>
It  ' s likely that I will go to Vancouver only .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#208:2>
If you plan to visit there , please tell me and we may then meet
each other in summer vacation . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#209:2>
Now I have to do my essay .

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#210:2>
The result <del> s </del> of last essay is not good , so I hope it
will be better this time . <O> four-Chinese-characters </O> , OK !

<ICE-HK:W1B-004#211:2>
Wish you have a happy life !
