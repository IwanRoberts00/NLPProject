Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X2:1:Z>
Some legislators have accused the government of giving away Hong
Kong autonomy in the Chief Executive election bill

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X3:1:Z>
The government has now changed the wording but the critics are not
satisfied and will propose their own amendment

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X4:1:Z>
Is Hong Kong giving away its own autonomy <,> or does Beijing
already have the right to remove the Chief Executive

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X5:1:Z>
With us discuss this issue are independent legislator Audrey Eu <,>
and legislator Tsang Yuk Sing Chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X6:1:Z>
Welcome on to the programme both of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X7:1:Z>
Audrey let me uh start of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X8:1:Z>
<{> <[> Exactly </[> what is it that you object to about the
wording and the Chief Executive election bill </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#9:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#10:1:A>
Well the first of all this course has gone through <,> various
drafts but <,> consistently throughout the draft uh there is the reference to
the central people  ' s government removing <{1> <[1> the Chief Executive </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#11:1:A>
That  ' s the part that that I object <{2> <[2> to </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X12:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X13:1:Z>
<[2> I </[2> </{2> see

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X14:1:Z>
And Tsang Yuk Sing do you object this as well </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#15:1:B>
Well well let me point out uh still

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#16:1:B>
In principle uh it is impossible for the <,> SAR government <,> to
modify any power uh <,> given by the Basic Law to the central government uh
central uh people  ' s government <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#17:1:B>
Uhm <,> the any law pass in Hong Kong cannot act or subtract uh
from <,> uhm <,> what are what is already there in the Basic <{2> <[2> Law
</[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X18:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X19:1:Z>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X20:1:Z>
But but I thought you are unhappy about the original wording

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X21:1:Z>
I mean if if that the case you cannot add a subtract from

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X22:1:Z>
Why were you concern about the original wording </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#23:1:B>
I was concern because the original wording <,> did give people
the impression <,> that there is a arbitrary path <,> uhm in <{1> <[1>
Beijing <,> </[1> to remove the Chief <{2> <[2> Executive </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X24:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X25:1:Z>
<[2> But </[2> </{2> that  ' s just an impression and doesn't really
change the Basic <{> <[> Law </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#26:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{> and and politically <,> that is very uh <,>
unwise

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#27:1:B>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> and it is unnecessary I don't think <,> <?>
biggest </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#28:1:B>
Well whether <,> Beijing has the path to remove the Chief Executive
<{2> <[2> or how </[2> <,> uhm arbitrary that path <{3> <[3> is <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#29:1:B>
Well it  ' s an important question <{4> <[4> and </[4> and it is very
interesting alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#30:1:B>
But I don't think it is relevant at all <,> to the uhm uh C E
election bill because because <,> whatever the power uh there is <{5> <[5>
<,> </[5> or we have to <,> you know it uh the Chief Executive according to
the Basic Law

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X31:1:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X32:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X33:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X34:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X35:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X36:1:Z>
So uh Audrey why why are this <unc> one-word </unc> then
if if the wording isn't that important and uh <{> <[> what  ' s it in Basic Law
</[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#37:1:A>
<[> Well it  ' s the wording is that </[> </{> not uhm not that
important I don't <{1> <[1> see that

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#38:1:A>
Yeah yeah I <,> <?> to </?> </[1> I agree with him in one sense
<{2> <[2> and which </[2> is that is very unwise <{3> <[3> and </[3> it  ' s
unnecessary

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#39:1:A>
<{4> <[4> But </[4> I mean I I think the the the problem of course
is is far more serious than that

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#40:1:A>
But it it  ' s it  ' s unnecessary because this is really a bill to do
with the C E election

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#41:1:A>
<{5> <[5> It  ' s not </[5> about the C E  ' s removal or the central
people  ' s government path to remove

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#42:1:A>
<{6> <[6> All you </[6> really have to provide for is to say that
you  ' ve should have an election when there is a vacancy <{7> <[7> the vacancy
</[7> can occur and no need to logical circumstance

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#43:1:A>
One is that <,> upon the expiry of a five year term and the other
is if the term is cut short and there  ' s a <{8> <[8> vacancy <,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#44:1:A>
And uh the the government  ' s bill already provided for the acting
uh Chief Justice uh sorry the acting Chief Executive to announce <{9> <[9> uh
vacancy </[9> and to specify the date of the vacancy

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#45:1:A>
<{10> <[10> So you </[10> really don't need to go into central
people  ' s government path <{11> <[11> to remove </[11>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X46:1:Z>
<[1> Oh you don't agree with it no good good </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X47:1:Z>
<[2> Uh ha </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X48:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X49:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X50:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X51:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X52:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X53:1:Z>
<[8> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X54:1:Z>
<[9> Uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X55:1:Z>
<[10> Uhm uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X56:1:Z>
<[11> But do </[11> </{11> <{> <[> you <?> think </?> </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#57:1:B>
<[> No no </[> </{> the problem is when can we tell and when
can the acting <,> Chief Executive tell <,> there there is a vacancy if it is
not uh you know the normal <.> ex </.> expiry of of a term <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#58:1:B>
Say <,> take this uh uh <?> hypothetical </?> case for example

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#59:1:B>
If the C E <,> uhm is taken by illness for <,> uh lengthy period of
time and he really cannot go to office

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#60:1:B>
Now when can <,> anybody say <,> that look <,> uh the uh he  ' s
already <?> vacan </?> let  ' s go for a new election

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X61:1:Z>
Uh so what you  ' re saying is that nobody in Hong Kong can say this
<{> <[> and we have to wait for Beijing <unc> one-word </unc> </[>
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#62:1:B>
<[> It because because the <?> appointment </?> </[> <{> <[>
because the appointment is made </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#63:1:A>
<[> I <,> I I <.> sup </.> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#64:1:A>
<[> I suppose if the US </[> </{> government <{1> <[1> uh <?> year
</?> </[1> president is sick then I mean you need some other <,> supreme
power God to say isn't <{2> <[2> it

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#65:1:A>
I mean it is it is not <unc> several words </unc> </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#66:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#67:1:B>
<[2> Uh no no may be no it is in the it is in the US constitution
</[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#68:1:B>
It is in the US constitution alright if the president <,> or if the
the presidency become <?> vacan </?> <{1> <[1> then the </[1> Vice-president
automatically become president <{2> <[2> right </[2> is already want in but
uh <{3> <[3> how you know </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X69:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X70:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#71:1:A>
<[3> When is it </[3> </{3> become <?> vacan </?> he  ' s ill
for <{> <[> two weeks three weeks so </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#72:1:B>
<[> Uh that that that </[> </{> is that is a very interesting
<{1> <[1> question

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#73:1:B>
You </[1> remember <{2> <[2> there  ' s there  ' s there  ' s a American
there  ' s a </[2> American film <,> Air Force One alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#74:1:B>
<{3> <[3> The </[3> the the president was taken hostage <,> by some
unknown <,> you know force and he  ' s simply disappear from the uh uhm from
from the public

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#75:1:B>
You see and <{4> <[4> and it </[4> become a very difficult decision
when can we say that the president <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> <{6> <[6> <?> that is
</?> </[6>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#76:1:A>
<[1> Well </[1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X77:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#78:1:A>
<[2> If you don't you don't provide <?> the </?> </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X79:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X80:1:Z>
<[4> Uh is it </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X81:1:Z>
<[5> Okay </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X82:1:Z>
<[6> Let  ' s let  ' s </[6> <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc>
this to Hong Kong </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#83:1:A>
<[6> So what </[6> </{6> <[> what he  ' s say we can't </[> </{>
decide for ourselves we need central people  ' s what <{> <[> <?> tell </?>
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#84:1:B>
<[> No no the </[> </{> appointment <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> the
appointment is <{2> <[2> made by </[2> the central government  ' s people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X85:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X86:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X87:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X88:1:Z>
But I mean <{1> <[1> not in <,> in in </[1> normal circumstances
uh when Hong Kong should know first uh whether someone is sick or whether
someone is going away <{2> <[2> and <unc> one-word </unc> </[2> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X89:1:Z>
And and Hong Kong informs the central government and the central
government has <{3> <[3> <?> what it </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X90:1:Z>
So so </[3> why why would <,> why would you suggesting that Hong
Kong would know that we would <{4> <[4> have to wait to be <unc> three
words </unc> </[4> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#91:1:B>
<[1> The <.> cen </.> central people government right </[1>
</{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#92:1:B>
<[2> Exactly </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#93:1:B>
<[3> That that is that is what I </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#94:1:B>
<[4> Of Hong of Hong Kong can <unc> one-word </unc> of Hong
Kong knows </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#95:1:B>
That was what I was saying <,> you remember uh at one of the bills
committee meeting

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#96:1:B>
I insisted that any removal uh of the Chief Executive from office
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1> should be initiative in Hong Kong <{2> <[2> right </[2>
either according to the <unc> one-word </unc> of uh of uhm uhm
provision in the Basic Law <{3> <[3> or </[3> otherwise <{4> <[4> right </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#97:1:B>
But still <,> the formal process has to be completed by uhm removal
by the central people  ' s government <{5> <[5> because the </[5> appointment
was made <,> uh by Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#98:1:B>
So it is for Beijing <,> to declare <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> right
definitely that now the position the post is <{7> <[7> vacant </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X99:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X100:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X101:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X102:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X103:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X104:1:Z>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X105:1:Z>
<[7> Or </[7> </{7> uh can we look at what the Basic Law says

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X106:1:Z>
Everyone says this is to be done and uhm consist with Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X107:1:Z>
Audrey is what is the Basic Law say about removal of the Chief
<{> <[> Executive </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#108:1:A>
<[> The </[> </{> Basic Law actually does not say that the
Chief Chief uh the Chief Executive is to be remove be removed

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#109:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Actually </[1> it it it is <,> the the drafting and that
that the uh the wording in the Basic Law is actually you know very clear and
careful <{2> <[2> because there </[2> is a provision that talks about the
appointment <,> of the Chief <{3> <[3> Executive and </[3> the other serious
<?> of </?> uh officials

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#110:1:A>
<{4> <[4> There is </[4> another provision which talks about the
removal <,,> of the other serious officials <{5> <[5> but it does </[5> not
talk about the removal of the Chief Executive

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#111:1:A>
<{6> <[6> There is </[6> really <,> this provision this other
provision in Basic Law which talks about impeachment <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and
impeachment <,> uh you you first of all have established the ground for the
impeachment and then there is lengthy process <{8> <[8> for for </[8>
impeachment to go through <{9> <[9> and then </[9> this is going to be
reported to the central people  ' s <{10> <[10> government </[10> for decision

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#112:1:A>
<{11> <[11> So </[11> that that the thing is there is a is a
process I mean you you you don't talk about a bracket <?> part </?> <{12>
<[12> remove </[12>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#113:1:A>
I mean this is the whole essence of a high degree of autonomy
<{13> <[13> that </[13> that even will the appointment doesn't mean the
central people  ' s government can appoint anybody they like it has to go
through an election in the SAR <{14> <[14> and then </[14> the central people  ' s
government can can appoint this person <{15> <[15> they can't </[15> appoint
it <{16> <[16> somebody </[16> who  ' s not gone through that post

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#114:1:A>
In the same way impeachment you  ' ve got to have reason you  ' ve got
to have processes <{17> <[17> and then </[17> this is come from the SAR

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#115:1:A>
But what is in this bill <{18> <[18> is that </[18> <,> central
people  ' s government can remove <{19> <[19> is and then you <?> say </?> <,>
what why </[19>

<$Z> <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#134:1:B>
<[19> Oh no no no <,> the bill the bill does not </[19>
</{19> say in any way that the central government can remove the Chief
Executive from office arbitrary

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#135:1:B>
No <,> <{1> <[1> uh I mean <,> no no no mean I mean let let let  ' s
be </[1> fair Audrey

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#136:1:B>
When we say now we are defining when a vacancy <{2> <[2> occurs
</[2> alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#137:1:B>
And the provision in that bill simply says a vacancy occurs among
other things when the Chief Executive is <.> re </.> is removed from office
by the central people  ' s government

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#138:1:B>
Now <,> that has to take place if the vacancy is to uhm uhm appear
in the middle of a term <,> <{3> <[3> alright </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#139:1:A>
<[1> Then the government use the word arbitrary it does not
say when </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X140:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X141:1:Z>
<[3> Yes but </[3> </{3> would would that actually be the other
way around that would it be Hong Kong telling central <.> pes </.> people  ' s
government that there is a <{1> <[1> vacancy and <,> </[1> and and then the
central people  ' s government act accordingly <{2> <[2> your point uh uh
another <unc> one-word </unc> </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#142:1:B>
<[1> Yes and what are the central government do </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#143:1:B>
<[2> Exactly <,> but even it that no </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#144:1:B>
Even if that takes <{1> <[1> place alright </[1> the central
government acts according to <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> you know some action <,>
<{3> <[3> uh initiated </[3> in Hong Kong <{4> <[4> alright </[4> still not
the central government has to do <,> is to remove the C E <{5> <[5> from
office </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X145:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X146:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X147:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X148:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X149:1:Z>
<[5> And and if </[5> </{5> the Chief Executive <{1> <[1> had a
heart attack and dies and then </[1> there  ' s a vacancy

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X150:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> The central </[2> government then remove that dead man
<{3> <[3> from office </[3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#151:1:B>
<[1> But for we before the vacancy yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#152:1:B>
<[2> No death </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#153:1:B>
<[3> No no no </[3> </{3> death is the only death is the exception
you know <{1> <[1> that I </[1> mean uh there is a separate provision <{2>
<[2> in the </[2> in the uh bill <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> uh normal expiry of uh a
term death <{4> <[4> and </[4> what else now if <,> if the person taking that
post <{5> <[5> a </[5> person who has been appointed Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong SAR is still alive and his term of office has not ended <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#154:1:B>
How can we say the office is vacant <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> if Beijing
does not terminate that appointment

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#155:1:B>
I mean <,> this is I think very logical

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#156:1:B>
It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that by you know putting this
provision <{7> <[7> in the in the </[7> uh the oath

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#157:1:B>
We are giving a bracket power <{8> <[8> to Beijing </[8> we have
<{9> <[9> no power </[9> to give any talk to Beijing <{10> <[10> to </[10>
remove the Chief <{11> <[11> Executive </[11>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X158:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X159:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<[8> What </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X166:1:Z>
<[9> What by </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X167:1:Z>
<[10> Yeah </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X168:1:Z>
<[11> What what </[11> </{11> about Audrey  ' s point that the
Basic Law which is very carefully drafted over a a period of five years

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X169:1:Z>
Uh was uh it  ' s silence on removal the of the Chief Executive and
talk only about removal of senior officials <{1> <[1> but what  ' s that <,>
yeah was </[1> that a deliberate act <{2> <[2> <,> uh ha </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X170:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> And why why would say </[3> <{4> <[4> <,> uh ha and was
it an oversight uh </[4> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#171:1:B>
<[1> Well I agree with Audrey on that point </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#172:1:B>
<[2> Yes definitely </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#173:1:A>
<[3> You you can't say they forgot </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#174:1:B>
<[4> Definitely definitely <,> I I I would no no </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#175:1:B>
It <{1> <[1> it it </[1> wouldn't have been an oversight <{2> <[2>
<,> you see </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X176:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X177:1:Z>
<[2> Right so </[2> </{2> why why are we now changing things

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X178:1:Z>
Why are we now talking about removing the Chief Executive when
the <{1> <[1> Basic </[1> Law doesn't talk about removing the Chief <{2> <[2>
Executive </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#179:1:B>
<[1> I </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#180:1:B>
<[2> No because </[2> </{2> that  ' s necessary

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#181:1:B>
Because if let me let me repeat <{1> <[1> if </[1> the appointment
<,> is still there <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#182:1:B>
If the appointment has not been terminated and the appointment of
course is made by <{3> <[3> the </[3> central government

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#183:1:B>
<{4> <[4> But if the appointment </[4> still there <{5> <[5> how
</[5> can we say that there is a vacancy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X184:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X185:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X186:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X187:1:Z>
<[4> But why does </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X188:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X189:1:Z>
Why doesn't the Basic Law consider this necessary </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#190:1:B>
Well the Basic Law actually <,,> uh is uh uh uh Audrey
pointed out early carry a provision <,> about <{> <[> impeachment </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#191:1:A>
<[> Impeachment </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#192:1:A>
So why why <{1> <[1> not say </[1> impeachment is one of the <,>
<{2> <[2> vacancy </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#193:1:B>
<[1> And and </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#194:1:B>
<[2> No in </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#195:1:B>
No no don't <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> we we we can't we can't <{2> <[2>
say </[2> that because impeachment itself <,> as as as provided in the Basic
Law cannot terminate the Chief Executive office

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#196:1:B>
We know that alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#197:1:B>
After an in you know an in impeachment uh uh resolution is passed
by the Hong Kong SAR legislature decision has to be taken <,> by the central
government no one else

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#198:1:B>
The central government may decide to terminate the Chief Executive
office removing from office or the central government may decide to keep the
Chief Executive there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X199:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X200:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#201:1:A>
Do you <{> <[> do you agree that  ' s </[> the only
circumstance that the the central people government can terminate the
appointment

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#202:1:A>
Are you say that <,> the only or you say there  ' re any other
circumstance

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X203:1:Z>
<[> Uhm Audrey </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#204:1:B>
Uhm the other circumstance of course is when the Chief
Executive uh resign

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#205:1:A>
And what else <{> <[> of the </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#206:1:B>
<[> I I </[> </{> don't think there  ' s any other <{> <[>
circumstance </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#207:1:A>
<[> Well then </[> </{> well why not adopt the Democratic
Party  ' s uh uh uh proposal for for community stage amendment which is to say
either impeachment or resigning

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#208:1:B>
It is <{1> <[1> for </[1> logical uh uhm <{2> <[2> <,>
<unc> two-words </unc> </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X209:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#210:1:A>
<[2> What if you agree </[2> </{2> but that could only be
those two <{> <[> circumstance why not </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#211:1:B>
<[> No I mean </[> <,> <{> <[> it is it is not our business

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#212:1:B>
It is our business to interpret the Basic Law </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X213:1:Z>
<[> Excuse me <[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X214:1:Z>
<[> I  ' m I  ' m sorry to interrupt but sorry we we have <,> we have
</[> </{> to take a break <{> <[> uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X215:1:Z>
We will turn </[> to this right right after the break okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X216:1:Z>
Don't go away we will be right back <&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X217:1:Z>
Welcome back

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X218:1:Z>
We  ' re discussing the Chief Executive election bill

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X219:1:Z>
Now Audrey you are planning to introduce some amendment to this
bill is that right what are you proposing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#220:1:A>
<[> I that I </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#221:1:A>
Well uh because I think it  ' s really not necessary in the context
of the Chief Execution election bill to talk about removal <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> and uh what uhm I  ' m suggesting together with Margaret uh is that all
that the bill need to say is that an election should be held <,> A when
vacancy occurs upon the expiration of the normal five year term <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> alternatively uh when there is a vacancy otherwise and <{3> <[3> upon
the </[3> expiration of a normal five year <{4> <[4> term </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X222:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X223:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X224:1:Z>
<[3> I see </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X225:1:Z>
<[4> So </[4> </{4> Tsang Yuk Sing do you uh have any objection
to that </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#226:1:B>
The the the one problem with that uh kind of formulation is
of course uh what I mention early how can we tell that there is a vacancy in
the middle of a term <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#227:1:B>
I mean <,> well <,> we need a specific uh <?> figure </?> <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#228:1:B>
Uhm who is to say <,> uh the post is now <?> vacan </?> let  ' s
start the election process

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#229:1:B>
<{2> <[2> Right </[2> of course the uh acting Chief Executive <,>
uh has the duty to announce the vacancy <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> but before he or
she can do it <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#230:1:B>
Let me stress the the the appointment has to be terminated <,> by
the central govern

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X231:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X232:1:Z>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X233:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#234:1:A>
<[4> I I think </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#235:1:A>
I I think Frank I mean we must be only place in the world where
the people can't tell when the head of the government <?> become </?> <,> <{>
<[> vacant </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X236:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#237:1:B>
No no I don't <{> <[> think so </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#238:1:A>
<[> I I </[> </{> I I wrote to actually to Professor Albert
Chan of Hong Kong University and I sent him a copy <{1> <[1> of the </[1>
amendment I  ' ve proposed and <unc> one-word </unc> his views

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#239:1:A>
And he uh he sent me actually I I got it today this letter that he
he sent to Secretary of Justice in in relation to my amendment he one of the
things in his letter he say I believe it is a public interest that we should
avoid if at all possible dealing with the question of dismissal of the C E by
the central people  ' s uh by the central government in the C E election bill

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#240:1:A>
He said after studying the matter I do believe it  ' s indeed
possible to do so <{2> <[2> and he </[2> he quoted my amendment and he also
said in the context of this letter

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#241:1:A>
He said it is not <?> an </?> a business of the SAR government or
the Legislative Council to interpret the Basic Law <{3> <[3> <,> to provide
</[3> the Chief Executive election bill that the central government has a
path to remove the Chief Executive in an under five set of circumstances

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#242:1:A>
It  ' s itself <?> actor </?> interpretation of the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#243:1:A>
<{4> <[4> I respect </[4> for this submit that the SAR government
and the Legislative Council should reframe from making such an interpretation
and hence <unc> one-word </unc> the <?> province </?> of the court
and the NPC standing committee so far as possible and as discuss about it is
indeed possible and this particular case and the kind of amendment proposed
by Audrey receive your <{5> <[5> support </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X244:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X245:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#246:1:B>
<[3> That right </[3> </{3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X247:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X248:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5> so <{> <[> what </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#249:1:B>
<[> I I </[> </{> agree completely with uh Professor Chan  ' s
<{1> <[1> remarks that we should </[1> not we should not <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
try to interpret the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#250:1:B>
I mean the the the it is not <,> the business is of the
legislature in Hong Kong to interpret the Basic Law right

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#251:1:B>
That is why I think there  ' s a problem with the uhm <,> uh
proposed uh the the amendment proposed by the Democratic Party <{3> <[3> they
are </[3> trying to <,> they are trying to set up <,> the uh conditions under
which the central government can remove the uhm <,> uh Chief Executive <{4>
<[4> from office </[4> and that is interpreting the Basic Law whereas the new
uhm uh wording suggested by the government <,> does not assume <,> any much
uh interpretation I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-034#252:1:A>
<[1> I  ' m glad you do </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-034#X253:1:Z>
