<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-031#1:1:A>
Good morning ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#2:1:A>
Can you hear me at the back

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#3:1:A>
Or if you can't let me know shout out or you can sit in the front
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#4:1:A>
Well we  ' ve got all the smiling faces on this bus today

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#5:1:A>
Ah <,> standing uh sitting next to me is uh Mr <unc> one-word
</unc> from Germany a group of of two and then right mm ah ah over there
Mr and Mrs <?> Hoo Hood </?> from the United Kingdom and then further back
<.> mis </.> Mr and Mrs <unc> one-word </unc> but from the United
States

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#6:1:A>
And the further back we  ' ve got Ms <?> Samways </?> a group of two
from Ireland and France

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#7:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#8:1:A>
Okay all this <?> morning </?> keep your smiles

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#9:1:A>
Okay and uh over here we  ' ve got five Chinese persons on this bus
altogether

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#10:1:A>
I  ' m Stella s t e l l a and my last name is Ma m a and for your
information Ma in Chinese means horse so if the Chinese word of Ma is too
difficult for you you can just simply remember a <.> muc </.> a a a a horse
sitting next to you okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#11:1:A>
And <unc> three-words </unc> two colleagues from the Hong
Kong Tourist Association ah that is Gloria and William

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#12:1:A>
And if you have any questions about Hong Kong about the <.> to </.>
the work of the Tourist Association ah they are the ones to turn to

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#13:1:A>
And it  ' s quite a special day today

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#14:1:A>
We  ' ve got two drivers driving us around and that is Mr Cheung and
Mr Ng <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#15:1:A>
Two drivers driving one bus because it  ' s <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#X16:1:Z>
Ng is Five isn't it

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#X17:1:Z>
Ng five </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-031#18:1:A>
Five Chinese persons

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#X19:1:Z>
Ng the word Ng </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-031#20:1:A>
Oh five ah Ng

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#21:1:A>
No not exactly

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#22:1:A>
It can means it can means five ah but that  ' s the problem of our
Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#23:1:A>
To one Cantonese sound we  ' ve got nine tones and each of them
carries one or more meanings

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#24:1:A>
So for Ng it can means uh it can mean the number five you are right
or a surname or something more

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#25:1:A>
<?> Well </?> anyway you  ' ve got it

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#26:1:A>
So we  ' ll start our tour today uh <?> it  ' ll it  ' ll </?> be quite a
long tour

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#27:1:A>
It is a full day tour going into our New Territories <,> and by the
<,> time we <,> finish the tour it will be around <,> four forty five ok

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#28:1:A>
Make sure you don't have any appointment in between

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#29:1:A>
And I <,> I would like to pass some of the itinerary or or the
itinerary sheet to you so that you know where we are going to <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#30:1:A>
So this is our itinerary uh for today

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#31:1:A>
We  ' ve got four stops before long and two more after

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#32:1:A>
The first stop we  ' re going to is somewhere called Sam Tung Uk
Museum

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#33:1:A>
Ah please make sure that u k here doesn't stand for the United
Kingdom but it is a Chinese word meaning house and this should be pronounced
as uk

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#34:1:A>
So next time when I ask you where you come from you say uk

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#35:1:A>
And the second stop is ah is somewhere called Tai Po and we  ' ll
visit two places in Tai Po that is the Man Mo <.> moun </.> Man Mo Temple and
the Tai Po Market

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#36:1:A>
Ah the temple and the market were the center of all activities in
the past so we  ' ll go there feel the life in the past <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#37:1:A>
Ah the <unc> two-words </unc> is New Man Shek Tong which is
an ancestral hall for the Liu clan

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#38:1:A>
And we  ' ll see how the local people worship their ancestor because
it is a very important part of our daily life

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#39:1:A>
And then the third stop Tai Fu Tai which is another uk of a
different nature

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#40:1:A>
This time it is the house uh for an official serving the Ching
dynasty and then lunch

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#41:1:A>
And after lunch we  ' ll go to the <unc> one-word </unc> of
<?> Quin Ting  ' s </?> study hall and the Tang ancestral hall again so these
are all six stops for this full day tour <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#42:1:A>
And we are now somewhere in the Kowloon Peninsula and over here on
our left hand side is the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#43:1:A>
Apart from being a typhoon shelter it is also a cargo handling area

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#44:1:A>
You can see very busy workmen handling their uh boxes of fruits
from all over the world

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#45:1:A>
<?> There  ' s </?> some of the uh cargo ships can anchor somewhere
off the typhoon shelter and what the people do is to send some lighters over
there to unload the cargoes are that what they do is to send the fruits from
this side of the road to the other side of the road because because there is
a wholesale fruit market nearby

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#46:1:A>
And the rush hour in this type of shelter is around four o'clock or
five o'clock in the morning and the busy cargo handlers work in the dark <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#47:1:A>
Uhm if you want to see them working very busily you have to come at
that time but make sure that you won't stand in their way because they will
be really rushing around with their <?> trolleys </?> of fruits because the
more they the more they send to the wholesale market the more they earn

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#48:1:A>
Their wages is uh are mainly counted by ah the number of boxes of
fruits that they send <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#49:1:A>
And for the typhoon shelter we mainly uh provide fish uh provide
<?> protection </?> to the <.> fish </.> <?> fishing </?> boats in Hong Kong
especially during typhoon seasons ah which last from late April to early
October every year

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#50:1:A>
So <unc> two-words </unc> say today is November and I think
it is one of our best ones in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#51:1:A>
And down here at the bottom of our itinerary sheet we have we have
included the map of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#52:1:A>
And well I think you all realize that Hong Kong is just a very tiny
dot on the world map and this has shown all of Hong Kong already

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#53:1:A>
And Hong Kong is basically made up of four parts

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#54:1:A>
We  ' ve got the <?> frog </?> - shaped Hong Kong Island down here
and cross the Victoria Harbour <,> cross the Victoria Harbour we have the
Kowloon Peninsula and to the north of Kowloon we have the New Territories a
very broad area and these are the three parts

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#55:1:A>
And if you want to know the

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#56:1:A>
<unc> one word </unc> size of Kowloon and the New
Territories you can simply draw a horizontal line somewhere in between the
word Kowloon and circle round where Tsuen Wan is somewhere in between you
draw a horizontal line across and actually there is a range of mountains
dividing Kowloon and the New Territories over there so you can see how small
Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula are and how big our New Territories is
but the major activities of the local people are centered on Kowloon and Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#57:1:A>
And the New Territories is the developing part of Hong Kong and
that the fourth part making up Hong Kong includes all the outlying islands on
the water of Hong Kong and altogether two hundred and thirty five <?> which
</?> it is rather hard to imagine all these scattered pieces of island on the
water of Hong Kong but later on when we go further into the New Territories
you  ' ll see the ah lovely pieces of cakes floating on our water

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#58:1:A>
And the largest one of them is Lantau Island to the west of Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#59:1:A>
Now you can see the Lantau Island is double the size of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#60:1:A>
And <,> then you see a borderline on the north <,> that is the
borderline uh over there and to the north of this borderline that is China so
you can see the very close relationship between Hong Kong and China

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#61:1:A>
And actually ah <?> while </?> Hong Kong has long been a Chinese
territory however we say that <.> t t t t </.> the development state of Hong
Kong mainly started when Hong Kong was colonized by Britain <,> and that was
in the nineteenth century

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#62:1:A>
Ah well the province here ah in China is Guangdong province and
Hong Kong is a part of Guangdong province and the capital city of Guangdong
<unc> one-word </unc> is Canton which is now called Guangzhou

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#63:1:A>
And in the nineteenth century all of China was closed to foreigners

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#64:1:A>
No foreigners can <.> hav </.> have their feet on China uhm but
leaving Canton <.> pa </.> partially open for foreign trade

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#65:1:A>
And at that time in the ah nineteenth century Canton was the only
place where Westerner Westerners could set their feet

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#66:1:A>
Uhm at those times we  ' ve got six summer months for trade in Canton
and that ah at that time ah <unc> one-word </unc> say businessmen
from all over the world would go into Canton and the commodities they traded
were mainly tea leaves soap and porcelain items

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#67:1:A>
However later on some British people found it more profitable to
trade opium into China

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#68:1:A>
And the they started the opium trade mainly because they have a
colony and that was India at that time which was the source of all the opium
and then well the trading of opium into China was a great blow to the Chinese
people uh both financially and physically

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#69:1:A>
But I  ' m not here to offend any nationalities at all but I think it  ' s
just a part of history

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#70:1:A>
And eventually a war broke out ah mainly because of the opium trade
between China and Britain

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#71:1:A>
The war broke out and China lost the war and as a result the Treaty
of Nanking was signed ah

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#72:1:A>
According to the Treaty of Nanking Hong Kong Island down here was
ceded to Britain for good and that eighteen years later in eighteen sixty
another treaty was signed between China and Britain

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#73:1:A>
And according to that one Kowloon Peninsula south of Boundary
Street which is somewhere near the range of mountain here together with an
outlying island called the <.> stone </.> Stonecutters  '  Island were again
ceded to Britain for good

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#74:1:A>
Another critical year is eighteen ninety eight when another treaty
was signed and according to that one Kowloon Peninsula north of Boundary
Street together with the forest area in the New Territories were leased to
Britain for a period of ninety nine years

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#75:1:A>
And therefore eighteen ninety eight plus ninety nine comes up to
the nineteen ninety-seven issue which is the major concern of the local
people nowadays

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#76:1:A>
Uhm now we say that the ah in the sixties seventies or early
eighties the local people were not quite aware that we we  ' ve got to be
returned to China one day uh because uh that was the development state of
Hong Kong and people were all <.> wor </.> working very busily ah working for
a living so they did not bother so much about ah our history

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#77:1:A>
However in nineteen eighty four ah that was another critical time
for Hong Kong because that was the year when Margaret Thatcher representing
Britain went up to China to discuss about the future of Hong Kong with the
Chinese officials

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#78:1:A>
And at that time they have made two very important decisions

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#79:1:A>
The first one is that <,> they the two countries have decided that
Hong Kong as a whole should be returned to China not just the leased part in
the north but the whole of Hong Kong because the ah I think after a few days  ' 
stay in Hong Kong you realize that Hong Kong as a whole is well connected
together in transportation administration business ah and most important of
all the people so there  ' s no point of separating the ah it into the leased
part and the ceded part

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#80:1:A>
So it was agreed that all of Hong Kong will be returned

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#81:1:A>
<.> Anoth </.> another reason was that ahem China has never
recognized all those treaties signed in the nineteenth centuries uh as the
equal and fair treaties because they said that they were forced to sign all
those treaties

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#82:1:A>
And another reason was that ah the people representing China
signing all those treaties at that time were the Manchu people in the Ching
dynasties

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#83:1:A>
Ah therefore they said that they were not the uh genuine Chinese
people and that in the eyes of Chinese they were a group of foreigners ruling
China and established the Ching dynasty

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#84:1:A>
And therefore they denied all those treaties signed in the
nineteenth century

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#85:1:A>
So Hong Kong as a whole will be returned to China by nineteen <?>
seventy </?> seven

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#86:1:A>
And that another great <.> de </.> decision uh on Hong Kong is that
uh <.> Chine </.> the Chinese government promised to keep <?> Hong Kong </?>
unchanged for another fifty years after nineteen ninety-seven and that means
we can retain the capitalist system in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#87:1:A>
We can have our own administration legislation our own governor and
enjoy <.> ous </.> our sort of freedom in Hong Kong that is freedom of speech
press travel etc so these are all being promised and we  ' ll see <?> what  ' s
happen </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#88:1:A>
Five more years to go and <?> there we are </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#89:1:A>
Well the majority of the local people will stay in Hong Kong just I
am not quite sure what you feel about it because many of our visitors ah told
us that why are many people or <.> all </.> all the people are leaving Hong
Kong and moved to our ah home country ahem because I think many of the
visitors uh have found more and more Chinese neighbours near them

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#90:1:A>
Ah but I think that is only part of the story

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#91:1:A>
That cannot reveal the full picture of Hong Kong nowadays and I say
I would say that ahem the majority of the local people will <.> re </.>
remain in Hong Kong and <?> that </?> over ninety percent of that and only
the ah the eligible people will have a chance to move ah to some other
countries

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#92:1:A>
So the majority of people the people will be here

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#93:1:A>
I <?> don't </?> think during this time the transitional period
they  ' ve got different stories with different individuals in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#94:1:A>
And basically what I feel is that most of the people like Hong Kong
but some choose to stay some choose to leave or some even choose to come back
giving up their foreign passports so very interesting stories ah in Hong Kong
with the local people so there is no never one sentence to represent all
movements

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#95:1:A>
And again it  ' s the same there is no one sentence to generalize
everything Chinese because Chinese is a ah multi-raced country

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#96:1:A>
We  ' ve got many different races of people

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#97:1:A>
Say what I  ' m trying to tell you is the way of the Guangdong people
ah living in Hong Kong and somewhere in in the north they may tell you
another version of the same <?> practice </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#98:1:A>
So very different stories from different people <?> interact </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#99:1:A>
I actually know a uh uhm retired BBC correspondent in Hong Kong and
he has been residing in Hong Kong for over thirty five years and he was
recently asked to write a book on Hong Kong or the local culture or some of
the remaining Chinese culture found in Hong Kong and he found it very very
hard to write such a book because ah when he meets a certain person who <.>
tol </.> tell him one version of the story when he meet <.> anoch </.>
another Chinese that Chinese will tell him another version of the story and
that  ' s the fact

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#100:1:A>
And while and all of them are telling the truth they did not they
did not mean to tell lies but they  ' ve got different versions of truth

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#101:1:A>
So that  ' s the interesting part of living here or staying here
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#102:1:A>
<?> Well </?> I don't know whether you realize or not but we are
already in the New <.> Terri </.> Territories area

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#103:1:A>
The purpose of this tour is to draw you away from the busy area of
Tsim Sha Tsui to save your pocket money from shopping by to divert your
attention <?> over there </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#X104:1:Z>
It  ' s too late </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-031#105:1:A>
Is it too late already <&> Laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#106:1:A>
Never too late you can come again next time and we are engaged in
all tours and leaving <?> you </?> no time for shopping

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#107:1:A>
Or you can pass word to me I  ' ll take good care of <?> that </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#108:1:A>
And this area is called <?> Tsuen Wan </?> that is circle one on
our map that means we are very uh <.> wil wil we </.> we are very near our
first stop which is Sam Tung Uk Museum

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#109:1:A>
The Sam Tung Uk <,> actually in Chinese means the three beam <?>
dwellings </?> which means the three rows of houses that a group of farmers
first built when they arrived in Hong Kong and they were the group named Chan
c h a n which is a very popular name in Hong Kong and in Southern China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#110:1:A>
And all the well they have been residing here in this ah walled
walled village for over <.> twen </.> two hundred years and they built it
into a walled village in order to protect the village people from the
invasion of pirates and bandits and make sure when we are getting off the bus
we have to imagine that we will be in a walled village that was built two
hundred years ago and there was no high-rises around no road for buses for
<unc> one-word </unc> for trucks etc

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#111:1:A>
And what you see when we get off are just sea water farmland ah
old fashioned looking people and that  ' s all

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#112:1:A>
Don't imagine all the high-rise

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#113:1:A>
Don't see all the high-rises around you okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#114:1:A>
And those people have been resided in this walled village for ah
over two hundred years and towards the end of the seventies the government
<?> put out </?> the need to retrieve the land from the village people
because they at that time there were only <?> very </?> few people residing
there

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#115:1:A>
Only the very old people who were unwilling to leave their home to
leave their original home while most of the younger generation have moved out
into the city area to seek a better job

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#116:1:A>
Ahem seeing this the government felt it necessary to retrieve the
land and to make it into a <?> book </?> museum uh to show the local people
as well as the visitors the way of life in Hong Kong two hundred years ago
and therefore towards the end of the seventies the ah they settled all the
original village people from Sam Tung Uk and they made it into a museum in
the early eighties

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#117:1:A>
So it has been therefore about uh uh ten years <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#118:1:A>
And when we are there you are uh you you can take pictures if you
like in the open area but not inside some of the home models etc <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#119:1:A>
Tsuen Wan here is the first satellite town ever developed by the
government

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#120:1:A>
And uh apart from being a residential and industrial area this is
also a very important <?> religious </?> area ah in the New Territories

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#121:1:A>
<?> Thus </?> we have five hundred <?> some </?> temples and
monasteries just in Tsuen Wan town

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#122:1:A>
However uhm what the major <.> nation </.> uhm the major religion
uh in China is Buddhism

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#123:1:A>
However in Hong Kong we found very small percentage of the local
people being Buddhist uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#124:1:A>
To become Buddhist we have to uhm ah well or or if you like you
have to reside in temples or monasteries serving the God every day and
evening uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#125:1:A>
They have to uh <.> re </.> recite all the all those prayers and
tune the beats etc

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#126:1:A>
Uhm an easy identification of the real Buddhist in Hong Kong is
that they have all cut their hair

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#127:1:A>
Part of the reason is that uhm there is a local term meaning here
and that is three thousand threads of troubles

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#128:1:A>
And in order to become a real Buddhist you have to purify yourself
and get rid of all the worldly troubles and therefore <.> a </.> all of them
have cut off their hair <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#129:1:A>
And I was said well uhm mentioning about the four <.> smal smok
</.> small percentage of the local people being Buddhist ah I would say that
most of the local people are actually ancestor worshippers

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#130:1:A>
Uh they do more or less like the monks or nuns do in the temple
but they <.> offer cense o </.> offer incense to their ancestors etc but I
think they are mainly ancestor worshippers not real Buddhist <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#131:1:A>
But actually I think most of the local people are <,> do not
worships <?> Sekol Muni </?> the founder of Buddhism so often that they would
very often turn to some of the functional gods

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#132:1:A>
Uh those are the gods that we turn to at times of troubles and
later on in the Sum Tung Uk Museum I  ' ll show you some of our functional gods
which may be as popular as <?> Sekol Muni </?> the founder of Buddhism

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#133:1:A>
So we  ' ll get off here and have a half hour visit in Sum Tung Uk
Museum

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#134:1:A>
For the first twenty minutes ah I  ' ll let  ' s keep together in a
group and we  ' ll do <.> I'l </.> I  ' ll show you how they live or how we can
live in <.> thi </.> such a walled village and for the last ten minutes I  ' ll
leave you some uh free time to walk around and feel the life as a farmer in
this village

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#135:1:A>
We  ' ll get off here

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#X136:1:Z>
Can we leave things on the bus </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-031#137:1:A>
Yes sure

<ICE-HK:S2A-031#138:1:A>
Mr Cheung and Mr Ng are very responsible responsible drivers and I
do recommend that you bring along your valuables so your wallet passport
cameras your husband and wife </I>
