The Government can score points by allowing mainland-expelled academic
Li Shaomin to return to the SAR , writes <bold> Chris Yeung </bold> </h> <O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#3:1>
<bold> LI SHAOMIN, </bold> the Hong Kong-based academic expelled
from the mainland last week , wants to come home to the SAR - and his wish
puts the Government in a tricky position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#4:1>
Dr Li , a United States citizen and an associate professor of
marketing at the City University of Hong Kong , was convicted in a mainland
court on July 14 of spying for Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#5:1>
He denies the spying charges .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#6:1>
Last Wednesday , he was expelled to the US . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#7:1>
&ldquo; If there is one central theme running through my mind
after all of this , &rdquo; he told the <it> Sunday Morning Post </it> in
Washington yesterday , &ldquo; it is that I just want to return to live a
normal life in Hong Kong . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#8:1>
Whether he will be able to do that seems an open question .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#9:1>
One line of legal thinking says the mainland  ' s expulsion order
applies in Hong Kong because the SAR is part of China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#10:1>
Another line of legal thinking says the expulsion order does not
apply in Hong Kong , thanks to the principle of &ldquo; one country , two
systems" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#11:1>
For the past five months , Dr Li has been a political football
passed between the mainland and the US .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#12:1>
Now , it seems , the ball is in Hong Kong  ' s court . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#13:1>
In talking about his wish to return to Hong Kong , which he calls
&ldquo; home" , Dr Li says he does not want to be seen as a human-rights
symbol .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#14:1>
&ldquo; I don't want to be a media star .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#15:1>
I don't want to be a celebrity . . . I don't want to write a book
about my experience &obrack;  in detention on the mainland &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#16:1>
I am an academic , and any books will be about my research into China  ' s
economic reform and development . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#17:1>
Although Dr Li might genuinely want to return to a normal and
quiet life in Hong Kong , the harsh reality is that his fate has become
enmeshed in the complicated concept of " one country , two systems" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#18:1>
Pro-democracy politicians , academics and human-rights activists
have warned that denying Dr Li entry into Hong Kong would deal a blow to the
SAR  ' s autonomy on immigration issues . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#19:1>
Government officials have so far kept silent , saying they do not
comment on individual cases .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#20:1>
Officials at City University , Dr Li  ' s employer , have said the
university wants to seek government advice on the matter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#21:1>
Beijing has yet to comment officially on whether Dr Li should be
allowed to return to the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#22:1>
Signs abound that opposition to granting him entry is strong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#23:1>
The pro-Beijing newspaper <it> Ta Kung Pao </it> ran a commentary
last Friday headlined: &ldquo; Of course Li Shaomin can't come to Hong Kong" .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#24:1>
The paper declared: &ldquo; Hong Kong absolutely will not allow
people who have been convicted of spying and deported for that reason to
return here to continue their activities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#25:1>
If it did , the SAR would become a base for spying activities that
damage the national interest . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#26:1>
In another commentary last Wednesday , the paper countered the
&ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; argument: &ldquo; On matters
relating to national territory , sovereignty and state security , there is
only ` one country ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#27:1>
Some people in Hong Kong always talk about ` two systems ' and not
about ` one country ' .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#28:1>
They say ` one country , two systems ' should apply even to spies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#29:1>
This is ridiculous and laughable . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#30:1>
Pessimists have good reason to talk down Dr Li  ' s chances of
returning to Hong Kong in light of the mainland regime  ' s obsession with
national security and its concerns about the SAR  ' s vulnerability as a base
for spying activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#31:1>
But the secrecy surrounding Dr Li  ' s case - little is known about
the charges against him or the expulsion order applied to him - gives the SAR
authorities some room to manoeuvre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#32:1>
Beijing has so far turned a blind eye to some &ldquo;
disagreeable &rdquo; activities in the SAR .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#33:1>
For example , prominent activist Frank Lu Siching runs his
Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy - which disseminates
information about , among other things , dissidents ' activities on the
mainland - out of Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#34:1>
Independent mainland unionist Han Dongfang , who was jailed for
22 months for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests , was allowed to
stay in Hong Kong after he was refused re-entry to the mainland in 1993 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#35:1>
He became a permanent SAR resident last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#36:1>
Leaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic
Democratic Movements of China have been branded subversive by Beijing , but
they remain active in local politics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#37:1>
Even though most alliance leaders are denied entry to the mainland ,
one of them , Lau Chin-shek , has been given special permission during the
past year to visit his ailing mother in Guangzhou . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#38:1>
As Mr Lu of the Information Centre rightly points out: &ldquo;
There are already many thorns in China  ' s side who live in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#39:1>
Adding one more , Li Shaomin , makes little difference . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#40:1>
In fact , Dr Li  ' s presence in Hong Kong could prove a political
windfall , for both the SAR and the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#41:1>
He could be seen as living proof that &ldquo; one country , two
systems &rdquo; works .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#42:1>
As such , he could join the other icons in Hong Kong symbolising
&ldquo; one country , two systems" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#43:1>
These include the annual June 4 candlelight vigil , the articles
written by dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng for local newspapers , and
the ongoing protests organised by Falun Gong practitioners in the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#44:1>
Despite all the tirades launched by hardliners , these symbols
are welcomed by many around the world as signs of Hong Kong  ' s unique
character under the new constitutional order .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#45:1>
They are among the assets that Hong Kong should protect and enhance ,
&ldquo; lest we become just another city in China" , to borrow a phrase Chief
Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen used last week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#46:1>
The way the Government has so far handled the
banned-on-the-mainland Falun Gong spiritual movement -
by ruling out the introduction of
anti-cult legislation , at least for the time being - shows a higher degree
of sensitivity towards growing fears , justified or not , that Hong Kong  ' s
autonomy is gradually eroding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#47:1>
The Court of Final Appeal  ' s recent right-of-abode rulings show a
similar sensitivity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#48:1>
Perhaps Dr Li  ' s case , which involves important matters of
principle and requires sophisticated political understanding , will join this
pantheon of &ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; success stories . </p>

Li Shaomin  ' s re-entry has resurrected confidence in the SAR  ' s
autonomy - but it may be at some political cost to the Chief Executive ,
writes <bold> Chris Yeung </bold> </h> <O> A picture </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#51:2>
<bold> Between two devils </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#52:2>
<bold> BY ALLOWING </bold> spy-case scholar Li Shaomin back into
Hong Kong , the administration of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa scored an
important victory in terms of Hong Kong  ' s autonomy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#53:2>
But it was not without political cost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#54:2>
Pro-Beijing figure Ma Lik , a local deputy of the National People
's Congress , may be a lone critic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#55:2>
But he did raise a valid and sensitive point regarding the
fundamentals of the &ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; concept .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#56:2>
Mr Ma asked whether the Government  ' s decision amounted , in effect ,
to a declaration of independence for the SAR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#57:2>
Given that Dr Li , 45 , was ordered to leave the country after
being convicted of espionage on the mainland and that Hong Kong is part of
China , it is hard to argue in favour of the academic  ' s return merely on the
grounds that the SAR has a different legal system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#58:2>
Although it is true there is no legal basis for the verdict of
the Beijing court to be applied in Hong Kong , the SAR Government cannot
dismiss as irrelevant the political reality that the conviction was delivered
after a judicial process on the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#59:2>
Giving approval for Dr Li to return to Hong Kong can , as some
commentators have been quick to point out , be described as a slap in the
face for Beijing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#60:2>
Asked about Mr Ma  ' s comments , a government official said:
&ldquo; You can't argue against him .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#61:2>
The simple question is: isn't Hong Kong part of China ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#62:2>
But on issues concerning ` one country , two systems ' it is better
not to make things explicitly clear . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#63:2>
It may be the strategy of the SAR Government to stick to
ambiguity when it comes to the question of who is winning the struggle at the
heart of Hong Kong  ' s constitutional arrangements - &ldquo; one country
&rdquo; or &ldquo; two systems" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#64:2>
The irony , though , is that supporters of the government
decision to allow Dr Li back , including many people who are normally
regarded as critics of Mr Tung , have praised the Chief Executive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#65:2>
To them , Mr Tung has made the right decision in the interests of
Hong Kong , one which is right in terms of how the &ldquo; one country , two
systems &rdquo; concept should work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#66:2>
Some officials are , in private , pleasantly surprised at the
move .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#67:2>
It came at a time when Hong Kong  ' s autonomy had already been boosted
by other decisions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#68:2>
One official said: &ldquo; It  ' s the third autonomy story .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#69:2>
First , you have the Falun Gong with no action being taken .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#70:2>
Second , there is the Court of Final Appeal decision on right of
abode , that reasserts judicial independence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#71:2>
All are upbeat stories for Hong Kong underlining its high degree of
autonomy . . .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#72:2>
It shows clearly we can take decisions definitely in the interest of
Hong Kong . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#73:2>
But publicly , SAR leaders have chosen their words carefully and
preferred to play down the implications of the case as far as the experiment
of &ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; is concerned .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#74:2>
Beijing , meanwhile , has kept silent , as if the mainland court  ' s
order didn't exist . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#75:2>
Repeatedly asked by reporters to explain the decision , Mr Tung
has stuck to the line that it was made in the interests of Hong Kong and the
country as whole .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#76:2>
&ldquo; We have to consider &obrack;  the principle of &cbrack; ` one country ' on one
hand , and on the other hand &obrack;  the principle of &cbrack; ` two systems ' when making a
decision , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#77:2>
Mr Tung pointed out that immigration affairs were within the
autonomy of Hong Kong , but stopped short of saying Dr Li  ' s case was purely
such a matter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#78:2>
The cautious and subdued manner of the Hong Kong and central
governments in not seeking to claim political gains from Dr Li  ' s return in
the context of the &ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; concept reflects
the inherent dilemma of the case . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#79:2>
It highlights the difficulty in making the right balance between
the interests of the SAR and Beijing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#80:2>
Placing too much emphasis on the importance of &ldquo; two systems
&rdquo; in Dr Li  ' s case - as many commentators have done - runs the risk of
creating new frictions in mainland-SAR relations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#81:2>
It will also be seen as openly ridiculing the mainland  ' s judicial
system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#82:2>
By keeping remarks on the case to the minimum , SAR and Beijing
leaders hope to avoid making it a precedent in terms of how the two systems
play out under one country in future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#83:2>
In a column published in the Chinese-language <it> Ming Pao </it>
on Thursday , Tsang Yok-sing , chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong , wrote: &ldquo; &obrack;  The &cbrack; Li case . . .
does not set a precedent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#84:2>
The central and SAR governments have already shown flexibility in
policies concerning the entry of ` sensitive persons ' . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#85:2>
This is because the Dr Li case could become a dangerous precedent
, from the perspective of Beijing , blurring the parameters of &ldquo; one
country &rdquo; and paving the way for future challenges to the principle .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#86:2>
In a joint article published in Thursday's <it> Apple Daily </it>
, two mainland legal scholars at the City University challenged the legal
basis for allowing Dr Li to return to the SAR .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#87:2>
Citing the Basic Law , which states Hong Kong is an inseparable part
of China , Zhu Guobin and Gu Minkang wrote: &ldquo; If Hong Kong can be
excluded as outside the country , is not Hong Kong becoming another sovereign ?
Is not ` one country , two systems ' becoming ` two countries , two systems?'
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#88:2>
&ldquo; What is ` one country , two systems ' all about ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#89:2>
What is rule of law ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#90:2>
We are confused , &rdquo; they wrote . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#91:2>
If the mainland scholars and many analysts were perplexed , it is
because of the long-held view that Hong Kong  ' s room for flexibility on
matters relating to sovereignty and national security has been extremely
limited . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#92:2>
It is also unlikely that the Government would have decided on its
own whether to allow Dr Li to re-enter Hong Kong , by regarding the decision
as an &ldquo; internal matter &rdquo; relating to immigration procedures .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#93:2>
It is doubtful whether it would have acted without prior
consultation with the central Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#94:2>
Remarks by Director of Immigration Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong that he
did not consult Beijing on the decision shed little light on the complexities
surrounding the issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#95:2>
Worse still , it gives an impression - most probably false - that
Hong Kong can make its own decisions on cases like Dr Li  ' s re-entry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#96:2>
Rightly or wrongly , the government decision will be interpreted
from sharply different perspectives .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#97:2>
Some will see it as a sign of a greater awareness among Hong Kong  ' s
leaders of the importance of sticking to the SAR  ' s system when it comes to
matters such as the case of Dr Li .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#98:2>
This may be wishful thinking . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#99:2>
Others may cite it as a further proof that Mr Tung , if not the
communist leadership in Beijing , is prepared to compromise on the principle
of &ldquo; one country &rdquo; at times , when it is expedient . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#100:2>
The depth of silence in Beijing and the low-key approach of the
Government in handling the return of Dr Li indicates a desire to treat him as
a unique case with the hope it will be seen by the public as such .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#101:2>
A heated public debate on the implications for &ldquo; one country ,
two systems" , is the last thing they want . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#102:2>
The same dilemma was faced by the Government in its attempt to
reconcile the differences between the interests of Hong Kong and those of
Beijing in two other recent controversies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#103:2>
These are the latest right-of-abode ruling and the approach to Falun
Gong followers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#104:2>
In the right-of-abode ruling , delivered by the Court of Final
Appeal last month , judges rejected government arguments and came to an
interpretation of the Basic Law which appeared to differ from remarks by the
National People  ' s Congress Standing Committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#105:2>
The Government , while no doubt disappointed at the result , had
to emphasise the independence of the Judiciary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#106:2>
But it also needed to make it clear to Beijing that the SAR had
already represented the central Government  ' s interests by asking the court
to consult the Standing Committee prior to giving its ruling &obrack;  even though
the court decided not to do so &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#107:2>
On the Falun Gong , SAR leaders toed Beijing  ' s line in branding it
an evil cult .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#108:2>
But the need for a new law to ban the group in Hong Kong was ruled
out - at least for the time being . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-013#109:2>
The strategy worked in the sense that potential political crises
were averted .

<ICE-HK:W2B-013#110:2>
The seemingly conflicting messages , however , have made it
difficult for the Government to score clear political points from these
issues , even though the outcome is most people want to see . </p>
