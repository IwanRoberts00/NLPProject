<ICE-HK:W2A-016#3:1>
Case of Hong Kong  ' s Land Development Corporation &obrack; LDC
&cbrack; </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#4:1>
INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#5:1>
Within the context of urban development , urban redevelopment is
an important and controversial public issue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#6:1>
As time goes by , some of the earlier buildings in a city become
structurally unsound whilst others may be functionally or environmentally
obsolete .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#7:1>
Redevelopment of these building sites thus becomes necessary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#8:1>
Following Harvey  ' s framework for the analysis of the urban
process under capitalism &obrack; Harvey , 1981 &cbrack; , urban
redevelopment can be interpreted as a process of capital accumulation may act
upon the urban redevelopment process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#9:1>
To this end , attention is focused on the recently-established Land
Development Corporation in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#10:1>
The LDC is a body corporate established by legislation in 1987 to
take charge of urban renewal and matters incidental thereto in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#11:1>
One of the distinctive aims of the Corporation is to channel private
capital into public redevelopment projects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#12:1>
It is argued that the roles and functions of the Corporation will
ultimately be constrained by the inherent nature of its profit-orientation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#13:1>
Since the Corporation has to act on prudent commercial principles
&obrack; Land Development Corporation Ordinance , Section 10 &obrack; 1
&cbrack; , it acts , in Harvey  ' s interpretation , as a financial institution
to facilitate the switch of capital into a built environment &obrack; Harvey
, 1981:97 &cbrack; defined as the totality of physical structure &longdash;
houses , roads , factories , offices , sewage systems , parks , cultural
institutions , and education facilities &obrack; Harvey , 1976:265 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#14:1>
In this endeavour it is doubtful that the Corporation can , on the
one hand , serve the private developers &rsquo; interests &obrack; ie. profit
maximization in the urban redevelopment project &cbrack; and , on the other
hand , look after the interests of the low-income and elderly residents who
are displaced &obrack; Lo and Ma , 1986:9 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#15:1>
CAPITAL ACCUMULATION AND SWITCHING OF CAPITAL </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#16:1>
According to Marx  ' s analysis of inherent contradictions within
capitalism , capitalism will inevitably face crises in the process of capital
accumulation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#17:1>
This may happen when competition between individual capitalists ,
each acting in their own immediate self-interest to achieve the expanded
reproduction of capital , forces them to lengthen and intensify the work
process so as to exploit workers and increase the rate of surplus value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#18:1>
One contradiction is the tendency towards overaccumulation &longdash;
too much capital is produced in aggregate relative to the opportunities to
employ that capital &obrack; Harvey , 1981:94 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#19:1>
This tendency is manifest in a variety of crises , including
overproduction of commodities and gluts on the market , falling rates of
profit, surplus capital &obrack; which can be manifest either as idle
productive capacity or as money-capital lacking opportunities for profitable
employment &cbrack; and surplus labour and/or rising rates of exploitation of
labour power &obrack; Ibid &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#20:1>
Such crises , in Harvey  ' s words , are the real manifestation of the
underlying contradictions within the capitalist process of accumulation
&obrack; Ibid.:101 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#21:1>
According to Harvey , these crises can be resolved by the switching
of capital between circuits . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#22:1>
Circuits of Capital </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#23:1>
As Harvey points out , capital can operate in three circuits.
First , there is the &lsquo; primary circuit of capital &rsquo; , for which
he does not give a succinct definition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#24:1>
Nevertheless , we may put the entire process of the appropriation of
surplus value by capital under the primary circuit of capital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#25:1>
The problem of overaccumulation is seen to be endemic in the &lsquo;
primary circuit of capital &rsquo; resulting , in King  ' s interpretation , in
overaccumulation in industrial production &obrack; King, 1989a:446 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#26:1>
In order to resolve this crisis , capital should switch from the
&lsquo; primary circuit &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#27:1>
The secondary circuit of capital involves the flow of capital into
fixed capital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#28:1>
Simply stated , fixed capital means fixed assets or capital assets
used to aid production , such as factories and office buildings. Here it is
important to distinguish between fixed capital engaged in the production
process and that which functions as a physical framework for production .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#29:1>
This latter Harvey calls the &lsquo; built environment for production
&rsquo; &obrack; Harvey, 1981:96 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#30:1>
On the consumption side , there is a parallel structure , but
fixed capital in the secondary circuit is called the  ' consumption fund
&rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#31:1>
It is formed out of commodities which function as aids rather than as
direct inputs to consumption. Some items are directly enclosed within the
consumption process &obrack; consumer durables such as cookers or washing
machines &cbrack; while others act as a physical framework for consumption ,
such as housing or sidewalks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#32:1>
These latter Harvey calls the <quote> &lsquo; built environment for
consumption  '  </quote> &obrack; Ibid. &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#33:1>
Furthermore , there are some items in the built environment , for
instance , the transport network , that serve both production and consumption .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#34:1>
Finally , there is the &lsquo; tertiary circuit of capital
&rsquo; which consists of investment in science and technology , and social
expenditures which are designed to improve the future productivity or quality
of labour power . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#35:1>
Underinvestment Problem in Built Environment and the Need of &lsquo;
Fictional Capital &rsquo; </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#36:1>
Crises within these various circuits of capital can be resolved
by the switching of capital between them, particularly in the case of
over-accumulation in the primary circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#37:1>
It should be noted , however , that for a variety of reasons
individual capitalists will often find it difficult to bring about such
switch in capital flows .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#38:1>
This is particularly so with regard to the switch of capital into the
built environment where <quote> &ldquo; ... investments tend to be
large-scale and long-lasting , often difficult to price in the ordinary way
and in many cases open to collective use by all individual capitalists
&rdquo; </quote> &obrack; Ibid.:97 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#39:1>
In consequence , there will be tendency towards over accumulation in
the &lsquo; primary circuit ' and underinvestment in the &lsquo; secondary
circuit &rsquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#40:1>
To resolve this there needs to be a money supply and credit
system which creates &lsquo; fictional capital &rsquo; in advance of
production and consumption in both the consumption fund &obrack; for example
, housing mortgages , consumer credit , and municipal debt &cbrack; and fixed
capital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#41:1>
In this endeavour, financial and state institutions act as <quote>
&ldquo; ... a kind of collective nerve centre governing and mediating the
relations between the primary and secondary circuits of capital &rdquo;
</quote> and the policies that they adopt can play <quote> &ldquo; ... an
important role in checking or enhancing flows of capital into the secondary
circuit of capital or into certain specific aspects of it &rdquo; </quote>
&obrack; Ibid. &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#42:1>
Depending upon the efficiency of the mediating institutions , the
switch into the secondary circuit may be achieved relatively smoothly or it
may be undertaken in the course of a crisis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#43:1>
Crises can be of three kinds : &lsquo; partial &rsquo; crises
&obrack; affecting a particular sector , region , or set of mediating
institutions , and usually resolved within that sector &cbrack; , &lsquo;
switching &rsquo; crises &obrack; involving a major reorganization and
restructuring of capital flows and/or mediating institutions to open up new
channels for investment , with these flows of capital dividing sectorally and
geographically &cbrack; , and &lsquo; global &rsquo; crises &obrack;
affecting , to some extent , all sectors , spheres and regions within the
capitalist production system &cbrack; &obrack; Ibid.:102 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#44:1>
Some Empirical Analyses of Switching of Capital </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#45:1>
Harvey has provided an empirical analysis of long waves of
capital accumulation and contraction in the world economy. Though his
empirical findings are very generalized , they are illuminating &obrack; King
, 1989a:447 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#46:1>
For example , the cycles of boom and bust in built environment
investment in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are given as
evidence of cycles of accumulation and consequent switching between economic
sectors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#47:1>
The &lsquo; Atlantic economy &rsquo; of the same period provides
evidence of geographical switching , whilst the pre-1973 property boom in
Britain and the USA is seen to be indicative of the coming of the &lsquo;
second global crisis &rsquo; &obrack; Ibid. &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#48:1>
In the course of the &lsquo; second global crisis &rsquo; private
net direct investment flows into Asia were substantial

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#49:1>
&obrack; see Table 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#50:1>
Since part of the sectoral and/or geographical switching crises of
the developed countries was resolved by a geographical shift in investment to
the developing countries , there is a substantial growth in the fluidity and
availability of capital in some of the market economies of Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#51:1>
And these flows have been greatly facilitated by the growth and
development of a wide variety of financial institutions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#52:1>
Moreover , the switching crises launched the investment wave in
the built environment of consumption .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#53:1>
During the 19705 , virtually every major Asian city experienced a
very rapid growth of office and hotel buildings as a result of <quote>
&ldquo; ... generous loans from the banking system and a combination of both
national and regional capital &rdquo; </quote> &obrack; Armstrong and McGee ,
1985:103 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#54:1>
For instance , domestic bank loans for building and construction in
Hong Kong rose from 10 per cent of total domestic bank loans in 1978 to 28
per cent by the end of 1982

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#55:1>
&obrack; see Table 2 &cbrack; . <O> Table-1 </O> </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#56:1>
Overaccumulation in Built Environment </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#57:1>
It is noted that switching solutions very often quickly lead to
overaccumulation in the built environment &obrack; ie. to an oversupply of
residential , office , commercial and industrial buildings &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#58:1>
This over accumulation is likely to be fueled by speculation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#59:1>
The boom and bust of the Australian property market in the second
half of the 1980s is a good example of this .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#60:1>
Massive volumes of capital , local and foreign , poured into the
construction and re-construction of certain elements of the Australian
capital cities and coastal regions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#61:1>
These capital cities competed with each other for the position as
centres of consumption &obrack; as casinos , elite residential/recreational
enclaves , expos and retailing complexes &cbrack; and as centres for
discharging command and control functions &obrack; the headquarters or
regional head offices of national and global corporations in the industrial,
commercial and financial spheres through the provision of &lsquo; intelligent
&rsquo; buildings , communications infrastructure, appropriately skilled and
disciplined labour power and a suitably &lsquo; cosmopolitan &rsquo;
lifestyle &cbrack; &obrack; Harvey , 1987:260-286 &semi; Berry and Huxley ,
1988:6 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#62:1>
As a result , the high volume and increasingly speculative nature of
investment has led to overaccumulation , especially in the office sector .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#63:1>
This has coincided with rapidly rising rates of space absorption or
take-up , rising rents &obrack; especially prime rents in the CBDs &cbrack;
and falling vacancy rates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#64:1>
Property values have risen even faster than rents , resulting in
falling yields .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#65:1>
This indicates significant speculative pressures at work &obrack;
Huxley and Berry , 1989:91 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#66:1>
Moreover , the State and Territory governments also entered the
property market to facilitate the switch of capital into the built
environment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#67:1>
The state government involvement was exemplified in the so-called
&lsquo; mega-projects &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#68:1>
These &lsquo; mega-projects &rsquo; have sought to integrate luxury
residential , tourist , retailing and leisure uses , targetted towards
wealthy Australian and foreign consumers &obrack; Berry , 1990:6 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#69:1>
The intervention is often facilitated , through the sale of crown
land and/or subsidized infrastructure provision , special enabling
legislation , fast-track &rsquo; planning approval , and financial
partnership arrangements &obrack; Berry , 1988:9-10 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#70:1>
However, the direct involvement of the state governments in property
developments further intensified the speculative forces for development in a
situation increasingly facing substantial oversupply and hastened the
speculative bust in the late 1980s . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#71:1>
Since the resultant built environment is relatively long-lasting
, it may become a barrier to further investment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#72:1>
Eventually it must be devalued to open up fresh opportunities for
capitalist investment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#73:1>
In the meantime, continuous profitable investment in the built
environment can be made possible by a structure of differentiated submarkets .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#74:1>
Some housing submarkets are manipulated by public and private
financial institutions as the targets for new investment while some are
subject to neglect and devaluation &obrack; of exchange values , but use
values remain relatively intact &cbrack; only to become , in time , targets
for further cycles of investment &obrack; Harvey , 1974:239-255 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#75:1>
For example, Harvey identifies no less than thirteen submarkets in
Baltimore , each characterized by different income and house-price levels ,
different forms of tenure , different social and ethnic patterns and the
involvement of different combinations of financial institutions with their
different lending and financing rules &obrack; Harvey , 1977 &semi; Bassett
and Short , 1980 : Part 3 &cbrack; <O> Table-2 </O> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#76:1>
Devaluation is thus place-specific, resulting in &lsquo; uneven
&rsquo; urban development over space and time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#77:1>
Accordingly , relationships can be established between the
development of the built environment and the rhythms of accumulation &obrack;
Smith , 1984:126 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#78:1>
WEAKNESSES OF &lsquo; CIRCUIT OF CAPITAL &rsquo; ARGUMENT </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#79:1>
Unfortunately , what cannot be predicted is the timing of a
switch into or out of the secondary circuit .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#80:1>
Rather , we can only identify some conditions and means which will
allow the switch to take place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#81:1>
In the light of ground rent theory &obrack; which identifies
differential , absolute and monopoly rent &obrack; Bassett and Short ,
1980:193-194 &semi; King , 1989a:448-450 &cbrack; &cbrack; , King identifies
four market conditions in which high or low interest rates , relative to
profits from the construction of housing , can influence the incentives to
switch investment into and out of the housing markets

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#82:1>
&obrack; see Table 3 &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#83:1>
&obrack; King, 1989b:712 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#84:1>
His case study of Melbourne  ' s housing market gives general support
to Harvey  ' s &lsquo; circuits of capital &rsquo; argument , at least since
1932 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#85:1>
According to King, <quote> <it> booms and slumps in housing
production , as well as the flow of speculative money capital into and out of
housing , can indeed be related to crises of overaccumulation arising
elsewhere in the economy ...

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#86:1>
<X> The relationship is not , however, direct </it> </X> </quote>
&obrack; King , 1989b:735 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#87:1>
Moreover , Harvey  ' s model needs to accommodate the forms of crises
apparently emerging in contemporary society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#88:1>
Economic crises are increasingly transposed into the political system
, to emerge as rationalization crises &obrack; whereby the state is unable to
deliver the requisite rational, administrative decisions to resolve the
crisis &cbrack; or as legitimation crises &obrack; whereby public
expectations of state activity outstrip its ability to ensure the legitimacy
of the status quo &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#89:1>
Ultimately , the crisis tendencies can be further transposed into the
cultural system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#90:1>
When the traditional bases of motivation &obrack; such as
self-achievement and material success &cbrack; are undermined by the
seemingly endemic nature of economic crises , underemployment , and loss of
faith in modernist progress , there can be a &lsquo; motivation deficit
&rsquo; , resulting in a motivation crisis &obrack; Habermas , 1976 &semi;
King, 1989c:854 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#91:1>
Social Relations of Built Environment </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#92:1>
In addition , when looking at the role of the built environment
under capitalism , Harvey has also to incorporate the social agents that are
involved &obrack; Ball, 1986:451 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#93:1>
Harvey argues that accumulation cannot be isolated from the class
struggle because the capitalist class has to find the means to exploit labour .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#94:1>
Harvey extends this perspective to argue that the organization of the
working class , and its capacity to mount an overt class response , can
affect the urban process under capitalism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#95:1>
Hence he concludes that &ldquo; the surface appearance of conflicts
around the built environment &longdash; the struggle against the landlord or
against the urban renewal &longdash; conceals a hidden essence that is
nothing more than the struggle between capital and labour &rdquo; &obrack;
Harvey , 1976:289 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#96:1>
In other words , <quote> &ldquo; whatever is happening in the built
environment it will eventually be resolved to the benefits of the
undifferentiated interests of capital in general , even if that resolution
generates further problems that have to be resolved in turn &rdquo; </quote>
&obrack; Ball , 1986:452 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#97:1>
Despite this , Harvey  ' s conceptualization of the role of the
built environment under capitalism does not clearly define the linkages
between capital-labour class struggle and the built environment and largely
neglects the social agents involved in the built environment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#98:1>
Although capital investment in urban redevelopment is for the sake of
accumulation , the social agents involved in the redevelopment process can
act upon the structure of building provision .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#99:1>
As Ball argues, <quote> <it> creating and using built structures
involves particular sets of social agents defined by their economic relation
to the physical process of provision itself . <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#X100:1>
Each historically specific set of social agents can be defined as a
structure of building provision .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#X101:1>
By provision is meant the production , exchange, distribution , and
use of a built structure </it> </X> </quote> &obrack; Ibid.:455 &cbrack; .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-016#102:1>
Within the context of urban redevelopment , therefore , a set of
social agents may include landlords , private developers, financial
institutions , government , and final users .

<ICE-HK:W2A-016#103:1>
Each social agent will have an economic tie with the urban
redevelopment process and the subsequent benefits of the new physical
landscape . </p> </I>
