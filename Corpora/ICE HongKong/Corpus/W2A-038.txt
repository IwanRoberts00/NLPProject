<h> <bold> Advances in the Consumer Electronics Industry </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#2:1>
Just like a computer , the latest consumer ICs can be made to
perform different functions by altering the software in them .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#3:1>
In order to cater for different application areas , a wide range of
consumer ICs are developed based on a common computer core .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#4:1>
This article will give a concise description on these ICs as well as
some practical applications . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#5:1>
<h> By Danny Leung , Techno Mind Ltd . </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#6:1>
The advancement of semiconductor technology has brought about many
powerful yet low cost Integrated Circuits &obrack; ICs &cbrack; for the
consumer industry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#7:1>
The latest consumer ICs have in them a processor which can be
programmed to perform extremely intelligent tasks - a processor with at least
four times the computing power of the APPLE II computer which once dominated
the Personal Computer &obrack; PC &cbrack; world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#8:1>
With the IC fabrication technology going sub-micron &obrack; i.e.
the minimum separation between two design features in the IC is less than one
millionth of a meter &cbrack; , the physical size of an IC is extremely small .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#9:1>
Since the cost of an IC is directly proportional to its size , the
cost of today  ' s consumer ICs is only a tiny portion of its cost ten years
ago .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#10:1>
As a result , applications that once were too expensive to implement
are now possible and affordable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#11:1>
Most of the ICs described in this article range in price from
US&dollar;0.30 to US&dollar;2.00 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#12:1>
As consumer ICs become more powerful yet less expensive , they will
increasingly affect our daily lives as well as the various industries which
use them in products <+> . </+> </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#13:1>
<h> <bold> Advanced Consumer ICs </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#14:1>
Consumer ICs in this article are defined as those used for such
products like toys , greeting cards , electronic games and accessories etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#15:1>
Should they fail , they will - in most cases - not cause serious
bodily harm or have serious consequences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#16:1>
As the cost of consumer ICs come down quite rapidly , more and more
products will incorporate them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#17:1>
Since the number of consumer ICs in existence are huge , this
article will only describe the most advanced few which are most likely to
cause a revolution in the consumer electronic industry . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#18:1>
<h> <bold> LCD Processors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#19:1>
LCD processors are a range of programmable ICs with Liquid
Crystal Displays &obrack; LCD &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#20:1>
The block diagram of a typical LCD processor is shown in Figure 1 .
</p> <O> A figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#21:1>
As shown in the diagram , an LCD processor is in fact a
self-contained computer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#22:1>
Like a computer , the LCD processor can perform different functions
by executing different software , which is usually written for a particular
application or game and , unlike the software for an ordinary computer , is
burned permanently into the LCD processor ROM during IC fabrication process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#23:1>
Once the IC is fabricated , the software cannot be changed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#24:1>
The largest single chip LCD processor currently in the market has
a 1024-dot monochrome LCD driver with 192K byte of memory which can be used
to store speech or graphics data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#25:1>
Larger LCD screens will require multiple ICs to implement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#26:1>
Although color LCD has already been available for the high-end market
for a while , low-cost color LCD processsors have just reached the low-end
market .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#27:1>
The current color LCD processor has a 540-dot 8-color LCD driver and
32K byte of memory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#28:1>
With the huge success of Tamagotchi-type &obrack; virtual pet
&cbrack; games and Electronic Fishing games in 1997 , LCD processors have
found their ways into the consumer market in a very big way .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#29:1>
This trend is likely to continue as LCD processors become more
powerful and colorful . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#30:1>
<h> <bold> Voice Processors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#31:1>
Voice processors are a range of programmable ICs with
speech/voice/melody synthesizers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#32:1>
The block diagram of a typical voice processor is show in Figure 2 .
</p> <O> A figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#33:1>
The biggest single chip voice processor contains 16Mbits of
memory which can be used to store voice or other data .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#34:1>
Two audio outputs are provided to achieve a stereo effect .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#35:1>
With one of these speech processors , 600 seconds of speech data can
be stored on chip . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#36:1>
For applications requiring minutes of speech , a speech
decompression IC is necessary in addition to a voice processor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#37:1>
The speech decompression IC will extend the speech duration of a
voice processor by 4 to 7 times .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#38:1>
The block diagram of this two chip configuration is shown in figure 3 .
</p> <O> A figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#39:1>
In this approach , the speech to be stored on the voice processor
is first captured and then processed by a computer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#40:1>
The computer will turn the speech data into a much compressed format
by a technology known as Code-book Excited Linear Predictive coding &obrack;
CELP &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#41:1>
In fact , this technology has been used in our digital telephone
answering machine in which human speech from a telephone line is turned into
compressed data format before being stored to memory .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#42:1>
Since this operation must be performed in real-time without the
assistance of a computer in an answering machine , more powerful , hence more
expensive , Digital Signal Processor &obrack; DSP &cbrack; chips are required
in an answering machine . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#43:1>
Applications with large speech content , like talking story books
, have always been confined to the computer world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#44:1>
With the emerging low-cost speech processors and decompression ICs ,
stand <?> - </?> alone story books which talk for one hour or more are
becoming a reality . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#45:1>
<h> <bold> Music Processors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#46:1>
Music Processors are a series of programmable ICs which can be
programmed to generate music in 4 or 8 channel formats .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#47:1>
In other words , 4 to 8 musical notes can be output at the same time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#48:1>
In addition , different instruments or voices can be used for each
note resulting in rich harmonies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#49:1>
The block diagram of a typical processor is shown in figure 4 . </p>
<O> A figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#50:1>
As shown in the diagram above , a music processor also provides
two audio outputs for creating music in stereo .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#51:1>
An external memory interface is also available for cartridge
applications in which music can be played for hours by changing cartridges .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#52:1>
Music processors have made much ground on improving the &ldquo;
electronic feeling &rdquo; of earlier melody ICs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#53:1>
These ICs are likely to create a musical revolution in the consumer
industry . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#54:1>
<h> <bold> Voice Recognition Processors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#55:1>
Voice recognition processors are a group of ICs which can be
programmed to recognize the human voice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#56:1>
Current voice recognition technology is known as isolated word voice
recognition and it can only recognize human voice in a word-by-word basis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#57:1>
Although intensive research is being carried out in continuous speech
recognition , low-cost ICs for continuous speech recognition will not be
available for some time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#58:1>
The block diagram of a typical voice recognition processor is shown
in figure 5 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#59:1>
There are two recognition methods available in a voice
recognition processor: speaker dependent voice recognition and speaker
independent voice recognition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#60:1>
For the speaker dependent voice recognition , the words to be
recognized must first be trained into the IC by speaking to the microphone a
few times , the words to be recognized in the training mode .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#61:1>
Recognition data is generated and stored during this training process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#62:1>
Once all words have been trained , the IC is switched back to the
normal recognition mode . </p> <O> A figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#63:1>
In this recognition mode , any spoken word will be compared to
the words which have just been trained and appropriate action will be carried
out if a spoken word is recognized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#64:1>
The accuracy of speaker dependent recognition can be as high as
99&percent; and the recognition vocabulary is infinite as any word can be
trained easily .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#65:1>
However , the recognition will only work for the trainer and will not
work accurately for other users . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#66:1>
Speaker independent voice recognition , on the other hand , will
not require training and recognition should work for everybody .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#67:1>
All words to be recognized must first be processed using a computer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#68:1>
For each word , 500 samples are required to be recorded from the
target group .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#69:1>
These sound samples are then analyzed by the computer and recognition
data is generated and stored on a voice recognition processor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#70:1>
From this point on , the operator is exactly like the same as speaker
dependent recognition described above . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#71:1>
The recognition data generation process in speaker independent
recognition is lengthy and the accuracy is totally depends on how good this
process is handled.

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#72:1>
In general , accuracy of speaker independent recognition is less than
that of speaker dependent recognition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#73:1>
With good recognition data , the accuracy of speaker independent
recognition can be as high as 96&percent; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#74:1>
Reliable voice recognition processors are beginning to appear in
the consumer industry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#75:1>
This happens because the IC/software technology has matured over the
years to a point where complicated voice recognition algorithms are now
possible and affordable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#76:1>
Once the ground is broken , we can expect to see more and more voice
controlled products which will really listen to you . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#77:1>
<h> <bold> Record/Playback Processors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#78:1>
Record/playback processors are a family of programmable ICs with
record and playback functions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#79:1>
The block diagram of a typical record/playback processor is shown in
Figure 6 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#80:1>
With a record/playback processor , a message can be recorded and
played back with special effects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#81:1>
These special effects include playing the <O> A figure </O> recorded
message backward , with higher or lower pitch , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#82:1>
It is also possible to record a sound and substitute the sound into a
song or game . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#83:1>
In addition , by taking advantage of the in-built Analog to
Digital Converter &obrack; ADC &cbrack; , many types of sensors like
temperature , pressure , position , etc . can be interfaced to the processor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#84:1>
The ADC will convert the continuous &obrack; analog &cbrack; signal
generated by a sensor to a digital data format for the processor to handle .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#85:1>
With these record/playback processors , digital recording will
soon replace the traditional cassette tape mechanism used in meetings and
memo dictation applications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#86:1>
These digital recorders will also be equipped with all functions
found in an electronic organizer as well as an electronic thermometer . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#87:1>
<h> <bold> Conclusions </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#88:1>
With rapid growth in its semiconductor sector , Taiwan has
emerged as the major player in the consumer electronic field .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#89:1>
This is vividly illustrated by the construction of many 8 &rdquo;
water fabrication foundries using advanced 0.35 micron IC technology in the
Hsinchu Science Park .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#90:1>
There will also be an even bigger Science Park for the southern part
of the island . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#91:1>
As the consumer electronic industry is heating up in Taiwan ,
more and more IC design houses will be set up there to take a cut of the
business .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#92:1>
Most of these design houses are so-called  ' fabless ' which means they
do not possess IC fabrication facilities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#93:1>
They rely on open IC foundries such as TSMC &obrack; Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation &cbrack; , UMC &obrack; United
Microelectronics Corporation &cbrack; , Win <?> - </?> bond , et al. , to
manufacture ICs for them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#94:1>
As the computer memory business has been going into uncertain
cycles in recent years , well-established IC companies in Taiwan are also
looking at the consumer electronic industry for more business .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#95:1>
As competition between companies in Taiwan is getting intense , it is
already evident that a price war is starting to benefit end-consumers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#96:1>
In order to survive in this competitive environment , companies will
have to be creative and resourceful .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#97:1>
What all this means is we definitely will see more powerful and less
expensive ICs than we see today . </p> <it> Contact email:

<bold> Alternative Approach to Fire Safety Design of Buildings in
Hong Kong </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#99:2>
<it> Sui Ming LO PhD , FHKIS , Authorized Person </it> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#100:2>
<bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#101:2>
The spatial design of a building can be influenced by the fire
safety codes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#102:2>
As buildings develop and become more complex and new materials are
used , the prescriptive fire safety rules may not provide an efficient
solution to the new building design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#103:2>
A system approach to the design of fire safety in buildings on the
basis of performance criteria may be necessary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#104:2>
In theory , the Hong Kong practice permits alternative
approaches to the building codes so long as equivalent safety standard can be
demonstrated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#105:2>
The recently published fire codes in Hong Kong have recognised the
fire safety engineering approach which may be regarded as a system approach
to the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#106:2>
This paper provides a brief discussion on fire safety
engineering design. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#107:2>
<bold> Fire Safety Engineering Design </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#108:2>
The main purpose of fire safety engineering design is to provide
a framework to demonstrate that the performance requirements of legislation
are met &obrack; or better &cbrack; , even though the design solutions
adopted fall outside the prescriptive recommendations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#109:2>
It takes into account the total fire safety package to provide a
more fundamental and economic solution than traditional approaches .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#110:2>
In other words , it may offer a flexible alternative especially when
designing for difficult buildings. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#111:2>
For most buildings , prescriptive recommendations in the fire
codes may be used for the design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#112:2>
Whereas , for unusual buildings , fire-safety engineering approach
may enable rational design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#113:2>
Some designers may have the opinion that fire safety engineering
design will merely be adopted for large and complex buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#114:2>
However , the fire codes do not explicitly restrict the use of such
design to large and complex building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#115:2>
Indeed , alteration and addition works in some old buildings may be
difficult in compliance with the new prescriptive requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#116:2>
A total fire engineering approach may be the only solution .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#117:2>
Figure I illustrates the approaches. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM ,
GRAPH,ETC </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#118:2>
<bold> The general framework </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#119:2>
Fire safety engineering design can be applied in considering one
aspect of the design &obrack; i.e .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#120:2>
in considering one element in a building &cbrack; or providing a
complete fire safety strategy of a whole building. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#121:2>
In the building design where one or a few elements have minor
non-compliance , the use of like-to-like substitutions &obrack; equivalence
&cbrack; which can be demonstrated by a fire engineering study may be
adequate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#122:2>
For major difference with the prescriptive requirements , risk
assessment may need to be carried out in order to demonstrate that the system
performance is within an acceptable level. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#123:2>
Fire safety engineering design involves fire , people and
building interacting studies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#124:2>
It is complex and a single set of procedures and calculating tools
can hardly be established for applying to all buildings. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#125:2>
<bold> The analysis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#126:2>
The major steps are to identify the problems in the design and
analyse the suitability of an alternative design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#127:2>
The architectural layout of the proposed design is reviewed and the
non-compliance items are identified .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#128:2>
&obrack; i.e. Why the design cannot fully comply with the
prescriptive requirements? &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#129:2>
An alterative design in order to &ldquo; substitute &rdquo; the
non-compliance part is proposed and a method in evaluating the suitability is
formulated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#130:2>
The evaluation involves demonstration of equivalence or acceptable
risk level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#131:2>
Equivalence is considered as equal performance between the designed
system and what is expected under full compliance with the prescriptive
requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#132:2>
An evaluation of the proposed design especially by means of
analytical approach should form the basis of the judgement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#133:2>
For simple design , a qualitative judgement evaluated by experts
may be adopted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#134:2>
Whereas , for other cases , quantitative <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM ,
GRAPH,ETC </O> evaluation by computational tools may need to be used for
assisting the judgement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#135:2>
Quantitative evaluation can be established on the basis of three
types of approaches , namely deterministic , comparative and probabilistic.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#136:2>
In deterministic approach , models are used to formulate the
fire , building and people interacting phenomenon .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#137:2>
Such models are deterministic and based on physical , chemical and
thermodynamic relationships derived from scientific theories and empirical
corelationships .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#138:2>
The basic objective is to show that all occupants can leave a
threatened part of a building without being subjected to untenable
conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#139:2>
Comparative approach is to demonstrate that the alternative
design provides a level of safety equivalent to that in a building that
complies with the prescriptive codes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#140:2>
Probabilistic approach is to assign probabilities of failure to
fire protection measures and frequencies of occurrence to unwanted evens and
to demonstrate that the likelihood of a given event occurrence is within
acceptable limit. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#141:2>
<bold> The Computational Tools </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#142:2>
Computer models can be used to perform the computation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#143:2>
Recently , numerous computer programmes have been developed for
modelling different aspects in the fire scenarios .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#144:2>
In general , the models include fire models and people/ fire
interaction models. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#145:2>
The fire models are , in general , classified further into zone
and field models .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#146:2>
The zone models are formulated by dividing the compartments into
parts and by the consideration of the conservation equations for mass ,
momentum and enthalpy &obrack; ref . 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#147:2>
These models such as ASET &obrack; Ref . 2 &cbrack; , CFAST &obrack;
ref . 3 &cbrack; , ARGOS &obrack; Ref . 4 &cbrack; aim at giving a
description of the macroscopic picture of fires .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#148:2>
It is , therefore , useful for simulation of fires involving
multiples compartments such as shopping malls , high-rise commercial and
residential buildings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#149:2>
The field models , on the other hand , consist of the detailed
considerations of mass , momentum and energy conservation where the field
quantities such as temperature , density , species concentration and velocity
, etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#150:2>
can be determined .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#151:2>
They are found useful in giving a microscopic representation and
description for fires which are often necessary for the understanding of the
behaviour of components in buildings and their interactions in fire
situations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#152:2>
It is , however , well-known that the numerical simulations using
field modelling techniques require extensive computational efforts and
resources .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#153:2>
Their applications are , thus , limited to the prediction of fires
in single compartments or elements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#154:2>
With the recent advancement of the computers , the possibility of
using field models may be extended .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#155:2>
For example , three-dimensional fire models such as CONE3D and
FIRE3D &obrack; Ref . 5 , 6 &cbrack; which incorporates the complex
interactions between solid fuel pyrolysis &obrack; i.e . thermal degradation
&cbrack; , gaseous combustion reactions , turbulent gas flow and radiation
heat transfer due to flame have recently been developed and can be solved
numerically to predict ignition and the development of fire due to the
burning of some solid fuels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#156:2>
The people and fire interaction models aim at simulating the
reaction of the people under fire situations in order to develop the
life-to-risk level of the occupants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#157:2>
These models are based on egress models such as EVACNET+ &obrack;
Ref . 7] , EXITT &obrack; Ref . 8 &cbrack; , EXIT89 &obrack; Ref. 9 &cbrack;
, WAYOUT &obrack; Ref . 10 &cbrack; , SIMULEX &obrack; Ref . 11 &cbrack; etc.

Although there are many computational tools developed , it is
worth noting that all the computer models are developed on the basis of
various assumptions and limitations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#159:2>
Careful judgement should be needed for using these tools. </p> <O>

<bold> Concluding Remarks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#161:2>
In Hong Kong , the complexity of buildings is increasing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#162:2>
The Government has explicitly recognised the fire safety engineering
approach .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#163:2>
The demand for such approach in building design is obviously
increasing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#164:2>
However , verification of the design by fire safety engineering
approach requires specialist knowledge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#165:2>
In practice , consideration should also be given to ascertain
the appropriate person who can carry out or certify the design works .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#166:2>
An Authorized Person who is responsible for certifying all building
works to be in compliance with the Building Regulations may not necessarily
have the training for carrying out or examining the fire safety design .

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#167:2>
Should another registered person such as a fire engineer be required
to certify the adequacy of the fire safety design ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#168:2>
Should it be reasonable to require the Authorized Person to certify
the engineering design ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-038#169:2>
Further consideration in this issue may also be necessary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-038#170:2>
&obrack; A practical example in demonstrating the fire
engineering approach will be given in a subsequent article. &cbrack; </p>
