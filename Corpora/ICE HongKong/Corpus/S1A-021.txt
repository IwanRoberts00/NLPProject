<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X11:1:Z>
Two weeks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X12:1:Z>
And which cities do you uh intend to visit <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X13:1:Z>
I mean uh Japan is such a long country <{> <[> so </[> you have to
sort of concentrate which area you would like to visit in the north or in the
centre where the capital uh is located or towards southern part of Japan </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#14:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> <{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#15:1:A>
Uhm may be we want to visit uhm the Tokyo

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#16:1:A>
About the Tokyo

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X17:1:Z>
So you go fly from Hong Kong go Tokyo first of all <{1> <[1> and
then </[1> I suggest to you to stay in Tokyo for couple of days

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X18:1:Z>
It  ' s depends on what you like to watch of course but then I would
like you to maybe uhm travel to Osaka which is second largest city in Japan
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and then Kyoto you might have heard already about the
city which is very an <.> a </.> old city and uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#19:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#20:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#21:1:A>
<unc> One-word </unc> can we get there by train or we have
to go there by aeroplane

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X22:1:Z>
<unc> One-word </unc> you can get by train <{> <[> <,>
bullet train </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#23:1:A>
<[> Uh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#24:1:A>
Is it near Tokyo </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X25:1:Z>
Uh it  ' s depends on which train you are taking

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X26:1:Z>
Do you know you we have a bullet train very fast <{> <[> super
</[> express train

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X27:1:Z>
Uh maybe only two hours </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#28:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#29:1:A>
Uh two hours

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X30:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X31:1:Z>
So you can spend may be uh five or <.> s </.> uh five days around
that area

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X32:1:Z>
And if you go if you like to go farther you can explore farther
but if you like to come back to Tokyo and then you can sort of uh explore
around Tokyo towards Mount Fuji or Hakone

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X33:1:Z>
There are quite many places you can visit </X>

Oh I don't know that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#71:1:A>
Are there any places that uh you think are most worth to visit
if we visit Japan <,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X72:1:Z>
Uhm yes I would like you to visit Kyoto <{1> <[1> where is the
</[1> most beautiful town in Japan and there are uhm traditional uh garden
Japanese <{2> <2[> <,> gardens </[2> and temples

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X73:1:Z>
And uhm if the weather I mean <.> whi </.> which season are you
going

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X74:1:Z>
Uh <{> <[> after the Easter </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#75:1:A>
<[1> Kyoto </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#76:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#77:1:A>
<[3> Yes it is </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#78:1:A>
It  ' s summer

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X79:1:Z>
Summer

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X80:1:Z>
In June </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#81:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#82:1:B>
Maybe <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#83:1:B>
June or July

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#84:1:A>
Yes it is in summer

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X85:1:Z>
Uhm because we have a very distinct four seasons <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> spring winter uh winter spring summer autumn

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X86:1:Z>
And normally spring you have uh it it is <.> ve </.> very
beautiful <{> <[> the </[> <.> cher </.> uh because of the cherry blossom you
know cherry blossom is very pretty

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X87:1:Z>
And and then autumn is very pretty too because the <.> ca </.> uh
changing of colour of the leaves

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X88:1:Z>
And summer uh it can be very hot </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#89:1:A>
<[1> Aw </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#90:1:A>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#91:1:A>
Very hot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X92:1:Z>
Yes it can be <.> h </.> much hotter than Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#93:1:A>
Oh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X94:1:Z>
Last year it was about thirty-six centigrade </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#95:1:A>
<{> <[> Wow </[> it  ' s too hot there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X96:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X97:1:Z>
Yes so it it can be quite hot and it can be quite unpleasant <{1>
<[1> but </[1> uh uhm if you go in June <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> you may have
rainy season in Japan and whole month could be rain </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#98:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#99:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{> 2

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#100:1:A>
Oh so that we can't visit the <{> <[> places </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X101:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> it  ' s not very convenient that  ' s why I  ' m
asking which month you are going </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#102:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#103:1:A>
That you suggest that we better go in spring or in autumn

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X104:1:Z>
Yeah spring and autumns are best <{1> <[1> really <,> but </[1>
other uhm seasons not too bad <{2> <[2> but </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#105:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm <,> but </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#106:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#107:1:B>
Uh when will the autumn start

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X108:1:Z>
Towards the end of September </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#109:1:B>
The end

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X110:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#111:1:A>
The end of <.> Sept </.>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X112:1:Z>
And then October is probably the best <,,> climate

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X113:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yes </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#114:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#115:1:A>
Just then I  ' ve heard that that uhm the prices in Japan is very
expensive then where can we have some cheaper meals because we have we are we
are not we cannot uhm <.> s </.> <{> <[> <,> <[> affords

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#116:1:B>
<[> Afford </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X117:1:Z>
Yes uh I understand Japan can be very expensive but uh
surprisingly enough I find Hong Kong is more expensive <&> A laughs </&> than
Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X118:1:Z>
Yes because uhm uh in Japan at least there many for instance like
eating out many reasonable restaurants <.> resa </.> reasonable price but in
Hong Kong there are so many restaurants whether they are either very cheap
but the food are not so nice or very expensive and the food are still may not
be so nice <&> A laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X119:1:Z>
But in Japan it  ' s almost sort of guaranteed

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X120:1:Z>
And if you pay may be fifty dollars or you can get very
reasonable meal which you may have to pay here <.> th </.> uh three hundred
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X121:1:Z>
So I don't think it  ' s that you  ' ll have any problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X122:1:Z>
There are so many restaurants you can approach

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X123:1:Z>
And you  ' ll get uh satisfaction </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#124:1:A>
That is it the exchange rate that make me think uh feel that
the thing in the prices in Japan are expensive or maybe uh if I live in Japan
and I uh earn there that I don't think that the uhm living standard is so
high <,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X125:1:Z>
Uhm I think cost of living can be very expensive but they once
you live there your salaries sort of follow the cost of living <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> and uhm you know where to buy I mean you know where where you to do
shopping

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X126:1:Z>
And I don't think you find that so expensive because uh uhm there
are quite a few Japanese young ladies working in Hong Kong <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> and they find find it very tough living in Hong Kong <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X127:1:Z>
Yes because accommodation is very expensive </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#128:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#129:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#130:1:A>
<[3> Aw </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#131:1:A>
Uh yes it  ' s much expensive

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X132:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X133:1:Z>
So they find it very uh hard to live in Hong Kong <{> <[> <,>
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X134:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#135:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#136:1:A>
How long have you been in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X137:1:Z>
Ten nearly ten years

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X138:1:Z>
<{> <[> <,> Yes </[> </X>

Do you like Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X142:1:Z>
Yes I I like it very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X143:1:Z>
I like Hong Kong very much </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#144:1:A>
Uh huh uhm what difficulty have you found that you have to
overcome living in Hong Kong <,,> when you when you first came in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X145:1:Z>
Uhm I think crowdedness crowd yes especially uhm before Hong Kong
I lived in Singapore </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#146:1:A>
Oh just like <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#147:1:A>
Is it similar to Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X148:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X149:1:Z>
Yes and than before that in England <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and when
I came from Singapore to Hong Kong I found it  ' s very crowded and <{2> <[2>
then </[2> uhm walking around for instance in Causeway Bay it  ' s very tiring

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X150:1:Z>
But now I get so used to it and I like this uh energy <&>
laughter </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#151:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#152:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#153:1:A>
Uh huh uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#154:1:B>
Do you think that Hong Kong is quite dirty if compare to
Singapore

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X155:1:Z>
Uh <.> co </.> compare yes yes some places

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X156:1:Z>
Yes but uh and <.> s </.> uh people say Singapore is very clean
but uhm it looks clean but I don't find it so clean <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X157:1:Z>
It  ' s strange

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X158:1:Z>
It may be climate

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X159:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#160:1:A>
Do you think that the rule of Singapore Government is uhm too
severe

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X161:1:Z>
Strict do you mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#162:1:A>
Uh yes strict

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X163:1:Z>
Yes I think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X164:1:Z>
They try to impose impossible laws on uh public and they can't
really obey I mean they they pretend as if they are obeying the laws <{1>
<[1> but uh </[1> behind your back they do whatever they like <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#165:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#166:1:A>
<[2> Ah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#167:1:A>
Are they discontent with the government

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X168:1:Z>

<[> I I </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X174:1:Z>
Yes but they  ' ve they are not really content they leave

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X175:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X180:1:Z>
Yes yes it  ' s not too bad but uhm <,,> uh I know some people are
already immigrated

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X181:1:Z>
I mean left Singapore

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X182:1:Z>
<{> <[> Singaporeans </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X183:1:Z>
And to Canada or States

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X184:1:Z>
And actually I have met one uhm engineer who works for <unc>
a few words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X185:1:Z>
He is also uhm he has also migrated to States from Singapore
about forty years ago already

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X186:1:Z>
And then he is now working in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X187:1:Z>
He doesn't want to go back to Singapore </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#188:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#189:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#190:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#191:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> is the weather humid and hot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X192:1:Z>
Very hot all year round </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#193:1:A>
Uh huh that uhm uh how would you compare Hong Kong with Japan

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X194:1:Z>
Hong Kong with Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X195:1:Z>
Uhm <{> <[> certain </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#196:1:A>
<[> Is </[> </{> it very similar the way of living or the uh
atmosphere here

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X197:1:Z>
No it  ' s not really <{1> <[1> similar at all </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X198:1:Z>
It  ' s more similar uh if you compare uhm to England probably <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> <{3> <[3> but </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#199:1:A>
<[1> Aw it  ' s </[1> </{1> not similar

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#200:1:A>
<[2> Huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#201:1:A>
<[3> Uh I  ' m <.> sur </.> </[3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#202:1:B>
<[3> Hong Kong </[3> <{3>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#203:1:?> Okay

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X204:1:Z>
Yeah between Japan and to England and Hong Kong to Japan of
course Hong Kong uh in comparison with uh Japan is more similar

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X205:1:Z>
They have more similar customs <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and but I
found it uh <?> moral </?> uh <?> hard principles </?> and uhm how can I say
uhm status I mean for instance like women <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> they are quite
different </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#206:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh <[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#207:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#208:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#209:1:B>
Uhm uh uhm do you think that uh <,,> what about the status of
women in Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#210:1:B>
Do you think it  ' s uh it  ' s still uh not so equal between men and
women

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X211:1:Z>
It is very uhm how can I say <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X212:1:Z>
Uhm yes uh status of women in Japan are not as high as the one in
Hong Kong <{1> <[1> I  ' m afraid </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X213:1:Z>
It  ' s improving but as if you see the picture of a parliament
majority of the members are men

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X214:1:Z>
You can see very few women members <{2> <[2> joined </[2> in the
parliament in the parliament

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X215:1:Z>
And uhm majority of the decision-making post positions occupied
by men men

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X216:1:Z>
And of course uhm what can I say competitive jobs are all taken
by men </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#217:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#218:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#219:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X220:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#221:1:A>
Yah is the Japanese women uh very obedient

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X222:1:Z>
<{> <[> Obey </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#223:1:A>
<[> Obedient </[> </{> to their husband

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X224:1:Z>
They look like but I don't think they are obedient </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#225:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X226:1:Z>
They are living completely <.> diff </.> two different lives

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X227:1:Z>
Uhm housewives forming their own lives and then husbands forming
leading their own lives

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X228:1:Z>
They don't sort of unite </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#229:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#230:1:A>
I thought that uhm very few Japanese family will uhm hire uhm
domestic helper like Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#231:1:A>
Is it true

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X232:1:Z>
It  ' s very expensive to <{> <[> employ </[> uh to uh employ
helpers </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#233:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#234:1:A>
So many women have to uh go out to work and then after work they
have to do their housework <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#235:1:A>
Uh will their husband help them in doing housework

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X236:1:Z>
Uhm I think they may promise that they are going to help <&>
laughter </&> but they don't help but they don't help so much

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X237:1:Z>
But I think the younger generation they tend to have a <&>
unidentified speech and speaker overlaps </&> uh keep more equal positions
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#238:1:A>
<unc> One-word </unc> will the uhm older generation
think that it will be a shame for men to do housework

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X239:1:Z>
Yes uh for instance like uh step into the kitchen <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> for the older men uh may be very embarrassing thing because that is uh
women  ' s territory <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> on at the same time women they
don't want their husband to come into the kitchen because that is their own
territory </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#240:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#241:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#242:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X243:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#244:1:B>
Uh but I think that is quite difficult to to say that uh
there is a equality between men and women because uhm very often uh many
people say that uh uh women has to <.> s </.> struggle to have equal rights
with men but I think that there are some aspects that is uh unfair to men <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#245:1:B>
For example uh men have to open the door for women <,> and and <,>
usually women uh do not think that this is uh uh a <.> se </.> sexual <.>
discriminate </.> sex <{1> <[1> <.> discrim <,> sex </.> </[1> discrimination

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#246:1:B>
So I think that is quite difficult to obtain a equality between
<{2> <[2> men </[2> and women

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X247:1:Z>
<[1> Sexual discrimination </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X248:1:Z>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#249:1:A>
Yes and they think that it  ' s their privilege to <{1> <[1>
have </[1> uh men to open the door for them

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#250:1:A>
And also that physical that women cannot be equal with men <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> physical <{1> <[1> physically </[1> men can't be equal with
the men

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#251:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#252:1:A>
And what is your impression of Hong Kong Chinese <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#253:1:A>
Impression of Hong Kong Chinese

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#254:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#255:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X256:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh yeah yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X257:1:Z>
Hong Kong Chinese people

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X258:1:Z>
<{> <[> Impression </[> of them uhm I think they are very
energetic </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#259:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#260:1:A>
Energetic

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X261:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X262:1:Z>
And uhm how can I say they like eating out <&> laughter </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#263:1:A>
Do you find sometimes they would be rude because they are not
uhm as disciplined as the Japanese people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X264:1:Z>
Uhm it  ' s it  ' s not the discipline so much

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X265:1:Z>
For instance like I when I first arrived and went to supermarket
and I bought something and I gave her change uhm money and then she just
threw the change towards me

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X266:1:Z>
And I was really surprise

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X267:1:Z>
It never happen like that in Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X268:1:Z>
They <.> al </.> always say thank you <{> <[> <,> </[> for
shopping in our store whatever with courtesy but she just sort of threw the
money away to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X269:1:Z>
And of course it she didn't mean to be rude to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X270:1:Z>
It  ' s just her habit

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X271:1:Z>
But you don't see this kind of habit in <{> <[> Japan </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X272:1:Z>
But I get used to that kind of habit

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X273:1:Z>
And then I think uhm uh not people still some some still do it
but not very many now doing it they try to be more polite to their customers

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X274:1:Z>
I don't know whether it become more competitive </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#275:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#276:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#277:1:B>
Uhm but sometime I think that uh the counter some counters
that selling the make some cosmetic <{> <[> <,> </[> cosmetics cosmetics very
often the sales are very impolite if they know that you do not have the
intention to buy the things

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#278:1:B>
Uh at first they will be very polite to persuade you to buy
something but if you uh reject or don't buy anything they will they very
impolite and may uh say something very bad to you

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#279:1:A>
<[> Cosmetics </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X280:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#281:1:B>
Have you ever encounter this

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X282:1:Z>
Oh I don't really because I don't really understand uh Cantonese
so they might have <{> <[> something said </[> behind me

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X283:1:Z>
But uhm uhm yes I found if you spend a lot of time a lot of time
just trying and then without didn't buy anything in the end they they they
show their annoyance </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#284:1:A>
<[> Aw </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#285:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#286:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X287:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#288:1:A>
As you don't know uh Cantonese do you found it  ' s very
difficult to communicate with Hong Kong people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X289:1:Z>
Uhm no not <{> <[> really </[> but I think it  ' s getting little
bit more difficult

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X290:1:Z>
Before many people can understand English and they speak English
very well but more and more people who don't speak English that well take
more sort of important higher job and I find it more uh getting more
difficult to communicate with them <{> <[> <,> but </[> uh otherwise I don't
find any problem at all </X>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#291:1:?> <[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#292:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#293:1:A>
Is that you  ' ve uh you can communicate with Hong Kong people with
English well and they can understand you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X294:1:Z>
Yes yes it  ' s no problem <{> <[> <,> yes </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#295:1:A>
Uh <[> Huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#296:1:A>
Yah I  ' m interest to know that uhm what encourage you to go back
to school <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#297:1:A>
What encourage you to go back to

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#298:1:B>
To the Hong Kong University

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X299:1:Z>
The the reason why I came back to the <.> univers </.> uh come uh
study studying in again is that uh my uh daughter has has already grown up

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X300:1:Z>
I mean she is already sixteen uh fifteen years old and and I have
a full-time helper

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X301:1:Z>
And I feel that I really need to do something

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X302:1:Z>
<{> <[> And </[> I don't really want to do something which gives
me very uhm temporal pressure I just want to do something which occupies my
time

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X303:1:Z>
Uhm and also uhm leads me to something which I can do in future
which I don't know I would like to do in future but I wanted to try something
different </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#304:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#305:1:A>
Uh huh so why do you choose uh English to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X306:1:Z>
Because uh I  ' m I  ' m always interested in studying English <{>
<[> <,> </[> and since I married my husband is British and I continuously uhm
speak English

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X307:1:Z>
And of course being Japanese and uh study in Hong Kong I have a
limit

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X308:1:Z>
I can't really study Japanese literature or you know I can't
really study like a Japanese student

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X309:1:Z>
I can't really have a choice

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X310:1:Z>
So naturally I took English literature </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#311:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#312:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#313:1:A>
Is the Japanese students uh start to learn English uh from
secondary school or primary school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X314:1:Z>
Uhm secondary school </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#315:1:A>
<{> <[> Secondary School </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X316:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#317:1:A>
So may be it  ' s hard for you to uh learn English do you think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X318:1:Z>
Yes especially uhm around started learning English long time ago
<{1> <[1> <,> at </[1> that time there isn't much available

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X319:1:Z>
I mean apart from textbooks from school not uh very not how can I
say broadcasting in English it  ' s all in Japanese <{2> <[2> <,> so </[2> I
have very limited opportunity to uh listen to the English native speaker </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#320:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#321:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#322:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#323:1:A>
Uhm what do you think is the main obstacle in learning English <,>
as a Japanese

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#324:1:A>
Whether accent or the vocabulary or other things that you think is
most difficult to learn

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X325:1:Z>
I think grammar

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X326:1:Z>
They concentrated on the grammar very much so we our grammar is
more or less quite good but uh lack of uh opportunity <{1> <[1> <,> you have
to </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X327:1:Z>
Yes you have to uh be able to listen to the native speaking
English more often as often as possible

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X328:1:Z>
That is the only way to be <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> <{3> <[3> overcome
the problem </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#329:1:A>
<[1> Oh lack of opportunity </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#330:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#331:1:A>
<[3> Is is there </[3> </{3> any English channel in Japan

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X332:1:Z>
Yes now they introduced very recently uhm I think <{> <[> BBC
</[> and also IC IC ICC ICN IN </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#333:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#334:1:A>
CNN

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X335:1:Z>
CNN </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#336:1:A>
Uh huh so you think that uh learning English in Japan is <&>
tut </&> the main obstacle is lack of <{> <[> opportunity </[> to speak and
listen with the uh native people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X337:1:Z>
<[> Opportunity </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X338:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#339:1:B>
I also think that this is our problem <{> <[> too <,> </[>
because in Hong Kong we also do not have much opportunity to practice our
oral English

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#340:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#341:1:A>
Yes because our English lesson is uh put emphasis on uh grammar or
the uh written English but uh we lack of time to uh speak our English <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#342:1:A>
So we also think that uhm spoken English is uhm the most difficult
part for us to learn

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X343:1:Z>
But I I find the uhm Hong Kong people has more fluency in
speaking <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> which means that I think you have more
opportunity much more opportunity { 2> <[2> than uh <unc> a few words
</unc> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X344:1:Z>
Yes yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#345:1:A>
<[1> Ah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#346:1:A>
<[2> Yes when compare with Japan </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#347:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#348:1:A>
Do you think that the uhm r sound is difficult for Japanese to
pronounce r that you have to roll the tongue <{> <[> that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X349:1:Z>
<[> l </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#350:1:B>
r

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X351:1:Z>
r </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#352:1:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X353:1:Z>
r </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#354:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#355:1:A>
Because is that uhm the when Japanese in Japanese language
there is r sound is it

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#356:1:A>
I  ' ve heard that

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#357:1:A>
I don't know whether it  ' s I  ' m not sure whether it  ' s right or
not

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X358:1:Z>
Yeah there is no <.> dstinsh </.> distinct uh distinction in the
sound between r and l <{> <[> <,> </[> so whatever r sound we sound with l
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#359:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#360:1:A>
Uh you think is it difficult to uh learn in English that when you
pronounce r and l

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X361:1:Z>
Pronunciation is not very difficult but uh listening is very
difficult <{1> <[1> since </[1> you have to uh <{2> <[2> <,> yes yes </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X362:1:Z>
Yes it  ' s very difficult because uhm I found sometimes I found it
I can't make it which is from which <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X363:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#364:1:A>
<[1> Aw </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#365:1:A>
<[2> Distinguish r with l </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#366:1:A>
<[3> Uh huh </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#367:1:B>
Uhm what do you think about uh the students in the Hong Kong
University

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X368:1:Z>
A majority of the student they are very hard-working

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X369:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yes </[> they are very serious and ambitious

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X370:1:Z>
And I think it  ' s very good </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#371:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#372:1:A>
Uhm do you like the environment of the university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X373:1:Z>
Yes I like it very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X374:1:Z>
They  ' re <.> ve </.> uh it  ' s very peaceful but yet it  ' s uhm
sort of stimulating as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#375:1:A>
Yeah but I think it  ' s not uh not enough space that because
uh but compare to the Chinese <{> <[> <,> University </[> or when we compare
to uh universities in other countries there may be uh more spaces more tress
that uh but I think is quite crowd in Hong Kong University

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#376:1:A>
Uhm do you think

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#377:1:B>
<[> University </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X378:1:Z>
I don't really think so </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#379:1:B>
But there is a problem in the Chinese University it it is so
big <{> <[> <,> you  ' ll </[> need the bus the school bus to go up the hill
and go down the hill

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#380:1:B>
You need to travel by bus

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#381:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X382:1:Z>
Oh I see </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#383:1:A>
<unc> One-word </unc> Have you visit there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X384:1:Z>
No I haven't </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#385:1:A>
Uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#386:1:A>
Uh would you further your studies after graduate

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#387:1:A>
Would you want to uh <.> s </.> continue your study with master
degree

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X388:1:Z>
I haven't uh thought about it <{1> <[1> <,> anything </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X389:1:Z>
I just want to try to finish this course <{2> <[2> that  ' s </[2>
all </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#390:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#391:1:A>
<[2> It  ' s that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#392:1:A>
Uh do you think it  ' s hard to uh study in this university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X393:1:Z>
I think workload is uh heavy and because I  ' m not uhm what can I
say I  ' m I  ' m also mother and a <{1> <[1> housewife </[1> and I have to think
about all other things and sometimes I can't just concentrate on studying

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X394:1:Z>
That  ' s quite disturbing <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> especially uhm if
something comes <{3> <[3> up </[3> and at the same time I have to write
essays I can't really concentrate and then sort of wasting my time on
concentration

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X395:1:Z>
And that quite hard </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#396:1:A>
<[1> Ah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#397:1:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#398:1:A>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#399:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#400:1:A>
How about you Veronica

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#401:1:A>
Will you continue your studies

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#402:1:B>
No I think that I will earn some money first and get a job
first because now uh Hong Kong uh <.> Hon </.> the Hong Kong economy is in uh
economic recession <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#403:1:B>
And so it is very competitive <,> in finding the jobs

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#404:1:B>
So I think that I will get a job first and then if I want to
continue my study I will uh <.> st </.> <.> st </.> study and doing the job
at the same time

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#405:1:A>
Yes I I agree with you

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#406:1:A>
And I think that uh maybe experience is uh more important than the
uhm academic qualification now <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#407:1:A>
And I will also uhm first uh to get a job or may be continue my
studies later

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#408:1:B>
Yes and now uhm many employers said that uh the uh the
standard of <.> s </.> students in Hong Kong especially the graduates from
the universities declining

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#409:1:B>
Do you think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X410:1:Z>
I don't know </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#411:1:B>
Do you think do you think they uh maybe their English is not
very well enough

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X412:1:Z>
Uhm I think some of them uhm they speak very good English and
they can write very good essays without so much mistakes

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X413:1:Z>
But maybe uhm English as being second language to <{> <[> them
</[> you can never sort of expect to write and speak without any mistakes

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X414:1:Z>
<.> Everybo </.> <.> every </.> uhm I think it  ' s quite natural
to make silly mistakes </X>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#415:1:?> <[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#416:1:A>
I  ' ve heard uhm that Japanese uhm work for one company for
their whole life that uh in the past is it right now

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X417:1:Z>
Yes <{> <[> it  ' s </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#418:1:A>
<[> Only work </[> </{> in one company in their life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X419:1:Z>
That  ' s they want to

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X420:1:Z>
Majority of them they like to do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X421:1:Z>
And can't they like the idea that uhm they commit their life to
the one company and the company uh in return look after their workers and
their families

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X422:1:Z>
And they have a very strong bond but uh Japan is suffering from
economic regression <{> <[> <,> </[> so uhm that dream <{> <[> is </[> now
very difficult to be fulfilled

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X423:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#424:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#425:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#426:1:A>
And so unlike Hong Kong they don't want to <?> change </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X427:1:Z>
They will lose trust </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#428:1:A>
Oh lose trust

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X429:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#430:1:A>
That uh the other company will think that oh why don't you
stay in your own in the previous company but uh go to our company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X431:1:Z>
Yes they may feel that you may uh uh you are not patient <{> <[>
enough </[> or you may not be able to uhm cooperate with other colleagues or
you may have they may think that there is kind of defect in your character
<&> A laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X432:1:Z>
And it  ' s not very advisable to <.> jo </.> change jobs very
often </X>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#433:1:?> <[> Oh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#434:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#435:1:A>
Is uhm morale is very important in Japanese company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X436:1:Z>
Yes uhm group how can I say group uh <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X437:1:Z>
Yes we value the spirit of team work <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X438:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> We think </[2> it  ' s very important </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#439:1:B>
<[1> Sense of belonging </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#440:1:A>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#441:1:A>
<[2> So that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#442:1:A>
Uh huh so that uhm every uhm employees would uhm think that they
would commit their life or devote all their efforts to the company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X443:1:Z>
Yes they what that  ' s what they aim for <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X444:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#445:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#446:1:B>
Yeah I think I I appreciate this kind of uh high morale for
the employees

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#447:1:B>
And I think that uh many Hong Kong uh for example Hong Kong the
shops in Hong Kong uh like to follow this kind of training to to train to
have their sense of belonging to have a high morale in the companies

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#448:1:B>
Do you think so

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#449:1:A>
Yes and I think <.> h </.> the big uh Japanese company in
Hong Kong still continue the morale in Hong Kong because I  ' ve heard that in
the morning <{> <[> <,> </[> they will have uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#450:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#451:1:B>
<.> Some </.> something like assembly is it

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#452:1:B>
Something <{> <[> like </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#453:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> they have to uh gather the uh uh employee
<&> B  ' s unclear speech overlaps </&> togethers and may be uhm <{> <[> to
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#454:1:B>
<[> Maybe </[> </{> the employer has something to say to them
to <{> <[> uh </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#455:1:A>
<[> Encourage </[> </{> them <{> <[> to </[> work in the day

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#456:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X457:1:Z>
Yes but on the other hand I think a company has to sort of give
guarantee <{> <[> <,> to </[> look after them

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X458:1:Z>
<.> I </.> uhm they don't you know they don't just sort of give
and make uhm their staff redundant

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X459:1:Z>
They need time they don't uh I think they employ very
conservative attitude even if time is good and then they  ' re very they become
very busy they don't uhm hire staff

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X460:1:Z>
They don't like to do that because they anticipate when the time
is bad they have to get rid of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X461:1:Z>
So they rather pay high higher salary give them a higher bonus to
uh encourage staff to work harder to keep the number as minimum as possible

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X462:1:Z>
So when the recession comes they don't still have to get rid of
they they can keep their staff

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X463:1:Z>
They don't have to get rid of the staff </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#464:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#465:1:A>
Yes uh because I have watched one TV programme they uh they have
talked about the economic uhm regression uh recession in Japan and they <.>
ma </.> uh many big company uhm didn't want to uh fire their employees
because they think that uh they should take care of the employees

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#466:1:A>
And they uhm rather than uhm fire them they uhm instead they uhm
try to uhm save their <.> expe </.> expenditure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X467:1:Z>
Uhm uhm yes uhm I think uh management they instead of just make
their staff redundant they try to cut their salary in order to save
expenditure <{> <[> expense </[> first and then if they can't cope with that
they try to uhm ask senior people to a early retirement rather than getting
rid of the younger ones

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X468:1:Z>
They want to secure younger staff  ' s future

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X469:1:Z>
Then if they can't do that then they will have to uhm make
younger ones redundant

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X470:1:Z>
But uh they take step steps </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#471:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#472:1:A>
Yes so it provides the sense of uhm security for the employees

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#473:1:A>
So that uh they want to continue their uh work in one company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X474:1:Z>
Yes that  ' s right

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X475:1:Z>
And then result here will be made redundant </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#476:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#477:1:B>
Uh I think that Hong Kong lack of this uh security in Hong
Kong uh if you work in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#478:1:B>
Because uhm <.> re </.> recently because there is a economic <.>
re </.> recession and many employers cannot cope with their business well and
they uh usually they just get the money and go away go uh out of Hong Kong
and then <.> le </.> leave the workers

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#479:1:B>
They do not uh they are not paid their wages <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#480:1:B>
And I think that uhm uh this is irresponsible for the employers
<,> many of the employers

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#481:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X482:1:Z>
I think Hong Kong is very special place different kind of places
as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X483:1:Z>
To many people uh Hong Kong can be seen as a transitional <.>
tran </.> transit transit place not permanent place <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X484:1:Z>
And on the other hand uhm it  ' s also uhm employees uh problem too
because they don't want have this kind of commitment to commit themselves to
one company

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X485:1:Z>
They also have to show their <{> <[> responsibility </[> to show
their eagerness to work hard and even under the hardship uhm they show that
you know they they  ' re willing to work

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X486:1:Z>
Otherwise <.> h </.> <.> employ </.> employer cannot sort of
judge whether his employee are going to stay or not or you know I I had often
that people change for very little amount of money

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X487:1:Z>
I mean if they offer may be five hundred Hong Kong dollars more
they just change but it doesn't happen in Japan </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#488:1:A>
<[> Oh Yes </[> </{>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#489:1:?> <[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#490:1:A>
Uhm uhm and I think the social welfare in Hong Kong is not
enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#491:1:A>
Is it uhm had is Japan has a very uhm complete and a more uh <{>
<[> <,> </[> comprehensive uh social welfare system

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#492:1:B>
<[> Comprehensive </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X493:1:Z>
Yes I think uh social welfare system

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X494:1:Z>
If you working for the bigger company and if you  ' re employed it  ' s
uh basically very good </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#495:1:A>
Because uh when you  ' re fired in Hong Kong and that uh you  ' re
you do not have a job that you can't uhm get much help from the government
that the allowance is very <{> <[> low </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#496:1:B>
<[> Little </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#497:1:B>
<{> <[> Very little </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#498:1:B>
And you have to depend on yourself

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#499:1:B>
And very often uhm the poor are not uhm are not <,> taken care by
the government enough

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#500:1:B>
And now uh recently uh many people have uh pointed out this
problem in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X501:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#502:1:A>
Yes that I think Japan is much better in this aspect

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X503:1:Z>
Uhm I think one reason is people in Japan pay higher tax </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#504:1:A>
Ah uh about how what percentage <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X505:1:Z>
It really depends on your total income

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X506:1:Z>
And I know that <unc> one-word </unc> uh if you earn a
lot you pay more than uh fifty percent <{> <[> <,> </[> so I think you
government can only help people uhm if they have a resource

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X507:1:Z>
So these resource are coming from people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#508:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#509:1:A>
Yes as Hong Kong is a low tax place that maybe the government do
not have enough uhm the tax income to uh expand to expand for the poor people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X510:1:Z>
I think I find people also quite selfish in a way <{> <[> <,>
</[> because they don't realise uhm they want to I mean if they work they
just want to have money they don't want to pay anything else to the
government right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#511:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B?> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#512:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X513:1:Z>
But I think you have to contribute to the government to make them
help you when the time is hard

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X514:1:Z>
That  ' s how it works I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X515:1:Z>
So uhm people should get involved more with government

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X516:1:Z>
And uhm of course watch government on the other hand they have to
contribute to the government too

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X517:1:Z>
That  ' s only way

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X518:1:Z>
And Japanese lot of Japanese people peoples feel that uh their
money which contribute to the government may not be spent on them but we know
that they those money are spent on the poor people

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X519:1:Z>
People who will need

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X520:1:Z>
So you may not get return but people accept it because they knew
if you are uh how can I say out of job or something the government will help
you in in return </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#521:1:A>
Yeah just like uh the States or maybe <.> w </.> other
western countries that the taxation is very high that but on the other hand
the uh social welfare program is more comprehensive and can protect the
people <{> <[> more </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X522:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> I think that  ' s only way you can do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X523:1:Z>
I don't think you can you know you don't want to pay the money to
the government then you don't <{> <[> get </[> any social security </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#524:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#525:1:B>
Would you still stay in Hong Kong after nineteen ninety-seven

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X526:1:Z>
Yes I would like to

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X527:1:Z>
I would like to stay as long as possible as long as uh government
uh permit us to <{> <[> <,> </[> stay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#528:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#529:1:A>
Do you uhm afraid that there will be great changes after nineteen
ninety-seven

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X530:1:Z>
I think some changes <{> <[> will be </[> uh occurred but I I
don't think drastic change for sometime may be for another twenty to fifty
years it should it will stay like this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#531:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#532:1:A>
Yes me too because uhm Hong Kong is very important for China that
to uh uhm for uhm the yes Hong Kong is a international financial centre that
uhm China had to keep this status of Hong Kong and I think there will be not
be much uh changes in economic policy but maybe other political

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#533:1:A>
And I think there would be more limitation restriction and changes
will take place

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#534:1:A>
This natural because uhm the government have been shift to another
country <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#535:1:B>
And I think that uhm if the people in Hong Kong <.> es </.>
especially the politicians if they do not have any activities to challenge
the power of the Chinese Government and I think that the Chinese Government
will not do uhm many uhm <.> repress </.> repressive activities in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X536:1:Z>
Chinese company you mean </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#537:1:B>
No Chinese Government

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#538:1:B>
<{1> <[1> <,> Yes </[1> because I think that uh what the Chinese
Government afraid is the rebel uh revolution or some rebellious activities

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#539:1:B>
If the politicians do not have such uh this activities and I think
that uh the <.> Chi </.> the Chinese Government will will not do so much
thing to to <{1> <[1> uh </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#540:1:B>
Yes without so much <{2> <[2> change </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#541:1:A>
<[1> Uh the </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X542:1:Z>
</[1> Change </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X543:1:Z>
</[2> They </[2> </{2> want to retain </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#544:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X545:1:Z>
As it as it is right </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#546:1:B>
<{> <[> Yes </[> I think that the main purpose of them is to
earn money and to uh <.> st </.> retain their power

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X547:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X548:1:Z>
<{> </[> Yes </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#549:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X550:1:Z>
I I think uhm Hong Kong will even grow faster because of the open
in China but what I am worrying is corruption probably </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#551:1:A>
<{> <[> Corruption </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#552:1:B>
<[> Corruption </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#553:1:A>
Oh corruption yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X554:1:Z>
Yes and also uh discipline in the police <&> A laughs </&>
because I think police in Hong Kong at the moment is quite good <{> <[> <,>
and </[> they are very helpful

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X555:1:Z>
And uhm they try to make sure uh ensure the security of the
citizens but that I  ' m not sure once if this it is returned to China </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#556:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#557:1:A>
Yes because uh the corruption cases in the police is more serious
than few years ago

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#558:1:A>
And I  ' m also afraid about this problem because uhm <,> when I go
back to when I go to China and I think it corruption is really a serious
problem in China and that would hinder the uhm <,> the security of the
society and also the economic growth of the society <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#559:1:B>
Uh what do you think about your future <,> job

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#560:1:A>
Job uhm in fact I want to uh do I want to take a job in the
publishing industry

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#561:1:B>
Publishing

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#562:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Publishing </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#563:1:A>
<O> Two Cantonese words </O> maybe a editor or something related
to this but that as you see that uhm in that uh in this year that the
publishing industry has been uhm has <{> <[> uh <,> </[> has been declined uh
some uh <{2> <[2> <,,> and </[2> <{3> <[3> some </[3> newspaper have uhm <{4>
<[4> <,> </[4> have been closed collapsed

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#564:1:A>
Yes newspaper

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#X565:1:Z>
<[> Publishing </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#566:1:B>
<[> <?> Has been decline </?> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#567:1:B>
<[2> Newspapers </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#568:1:B>
<[3> Newspaper </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#569:1:B>
<[4> Have been closed </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#570:1:B>
There are fewer newspapers in Hong Kong because of the keen
competition

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#571:1:B>
And uh they lower the cost and lead to many and the <.> co </.>
led to the collapse of some uh uh publishing uh companies

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#572:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#573:1:A>
Yes so that I think it  ' s hard to find a job like that now

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#574:1:A>
Maybe I will take uhm another job first or if I have a chance
later I will also still try to work in the publishing industry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#575:1:A>
Uh how about you

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#576:1:B>
Uh I want to be a teacher but uhm it is quite difficult to
find a job uhm of teacher now because uhm <.> man </.> uh many graduates also
want to be a <{> <[> teacher I </[> think that especially uh you take Arts
subjects

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#577:1:B>
Uhm there are not so much varieties of job that you can choose for
the arts students <,> because uh very often if you do the job for business
circle and you have to uh you have to study uh <.> busi </.> uh business or
study economics <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#578:1:B>
And Arts students do not have this uh privilege I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-021#579:1:B>
So uhm uh but I think that uhm teaching is a challenging job so I
want to be a teacher

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-021#580:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{> </I>
