<ICE-HK:W2B-011#3:1>
<bold> JUST BY COINCIDENCE, </bold> the conviction of
American-Chinese scholars Li Shaomin and Gao Zhan of espionage in Beijing and
their release to the United States last week followed the Hong Kong Court of
Final Appeal  ' s &obrack;  CFA's &cbrack; decisions in Chong Fung-yuen and two other
right-of-abode cases a week earlier .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#4:1>
The juxtaposition of the two events gives much food for thought . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#5:1>
The reality of the outcome of the Beijing trials is clear to
everyone , whatever the trappings of law and court procedure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#6:1>
They are political deals carefully worked out between Beijing and
Washington DC .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#7:1>
The <it> Hong Kong Economic Journal </it> spoke for many when it said
in its editorial last Friday: &ldquo; Time and again , the Chinese Government
treats the law as merely a game and a political tool in diplomatic wrangles
for political interests .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#8:1>
How then can the courts on the mainland hope to establish their
authority ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#9:1>
How can its legal system hope to give compatriots and foreigners any
confidence ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#10:1>
How distant is China from the rule of law . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#11:1>
The rule of law crumples when the courts ' decisions become
political bargaining chips .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#12:1>
This is true not only of the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#13:1>
It is true anywhere , including the Hong Kong SAR under Chinese
sovereignty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#14:1>
If the CFA  ' s July 20 judgment regarding Chong Fung-yuen has been
hailed by the legal community and others in Hong Kong , it is , first and
foremost , because it is perceived as the CFA reclaiming a measure of its
autonomy put into jeopardy by the National People  ' s Congress Standing
Committee  ' s interpretation in June 1999 , and its own capitulating judgment
in the right-of-abode case of Lau Kong-yung which followed this in December
the same year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#15:1>
There are important safeguards laid down in the latest judgment ,
deserving of admiration .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#16:1>
First , there is the clear declaration that the courts in Hong Kong
are duty-bound under the Basic Law to interpret its provisions according to
common-law principles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#17:1>
Second , there is the unequivocal rejection of the Government  ' s
proposal to broaden the conditions under which the CFA is required to refer a
Basic Law provision to the Standing Committee for interpretation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#18:1>
Third , there is the CFA  ' s refusal to label &ldquo; black
&rdquo; as &ldquo; white &rdquo; when Article 24(2)(1 &cbrack; of the Basic Law
plainly states that any Chinese national born in Hong Kong is a Hong Kong
permanent resident . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#19:1>
Whatever else one may say of the CFA  ' s judgment , these rulings
of the court are important , far-reaching and a boost to Hong Kong  ' s
independent judicial power under the " one country , two systems &rdquo;
principle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#20:1>
Had the court succumbed on these issues , independent judicial power
would have been bereft of all meaning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#21:1>
In Chong Fung-yuen  ' s case , it might be said , the CFA has politely
put its foot down . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#22:1>
Yet survival is not without casualty , and the casualty is heavy
enough .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#23:1>
To begin with , the survival is achieved by a judicial retreat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#24:1>
The CFA reiterates that the Standing Committee has the power to
interpret any provision of the Basic Law at any time , and that such an
interpretation will be binding on Hong Kong  ' s courts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#25:1>
It is only where the Standing Committee has not issued an
interpretation - as was the case with Article 24(2)(1 &cbrack; - that the Hong Kong
courts are free to interpret , and it is then that the interpretation must be
in accordance with common-law principles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#26:1>
The clear consequence of this statement of law is that Hong Kong  ' s
judicial autonomy and the common law are retained only to the degree that the
Standing Committee chooses to allow it , and that Hong Kong  ' s autonomy will
thus depend entirely on Beijing  ' s self-restraint . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#27:1>
The CFA  ' s ruling indicates that , although the Standing
Committee can do what it likes , the Hong Kong courts will not compromise the
common law on their own . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#28:1>
The statement of the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission
expressing concern at the CFA  ' s judgment for not being &ldquo; completely in
accord &rdquo; with the Standing Committee  ' s interpretation of June 1999
indicates Beijing will not leave the matter like this for long . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#29:1>
What Beijing wants is that the court should voluntarily consider
itself bound not only by the content of any interpretation of specific
provisions by the Standing Committee , but as if the meaning of that
interpretation is now written into the relevant articles of the law in the
same way as an amendment to the law .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#30:1>
It also wants the courts to be bound by the reasoning which led to
the interpretation , or which can be distilled from it , as if the
interpretation were a judgment of a superior court . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#31:1>
Even if there is to be no immediate re-interpretation of this
latest case by the Standing Committee , Beijing will continue to storm the
citadel .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#32:1>
And , as Solicitor-General Robert Allcock told the press , the
Government will continue to press the view of the Legislative Affairs
Commission before the Hong Kong courts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#33:1>
This means that while the courts will uphold the common law , the
Government will continue to follow the Basic Law as annotated by Beijing .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#34:1>
Another major casualty resulting from the judicial retreat on
another front is humanity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#35:1>
In the landmark judgment of Ng Ka-ling and Chan Kam-nga in January
1999 , the CFA adopted the &ldquo; purposive and generous interpretation
&rdquo; as the proper approach for the interpretation of the Basic Law as a
constitutional instrument .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#36:1>
This means the court  ' s interpretation of the provisions of the Basic
Law must take account of international covenants protecting fundamental
rights , which are part of the context in which such provisions need to be
considered . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#37:1>
But in the July 20 judgment of the Chong Fung-yuen case , the CFA
has introduced the idea of ambiguity .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#38:1>
And the ground rule formulated by the court in this latest case is
that when the language of the Basic Law is clear - that is to say , free from
ambiguity - then extrinsic materials cannot affect the interpretation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#39:1>
That ground rule was fine as far as it went in Chong Fung-yuen  ' s
case .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#40:1>
But in the adopted-children judgment of Agnes Tam Nga-yin - which was
delivered on the same day - it foundered and produced the anomalous result
that on the fundamental issue of the right of abode , adopted children are
treated differently from biological children .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#41:1>
This occurred despite the fact that the domestic laws of Hong Kong
and of China , as well as the spirit of international covenants protecting
the right of family unity and the rights of the child , decree that lawfully
adopted children are to be treated just the same as if they are children born
to their adoptive parents in lawful wedlock . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#42:1>
The court  ' s decision , which in effect nullifies the legal
effect of adoption when it comes to the right of abode , will have disturbing
consequences for adoptive families and the institution of adoption itself .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#43:1>
Here , the ground rule set out in Chong Fung-yuen  ' s case has
undergone a subtle mutation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#44:1>
The starting point is ambiguity , and it is only when an ambiguity in
the language is established that the court can go on to consider the Bill of
Rights and domestic laws relating to adopted children , which are &ldquo;
part of the context &rdquo; that then needs to be taken into account .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#45:1>
But since no ambiguity was found in the language of the relevant
Basic Law provision , that part of the context could not be considered in the
adopted-children case . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#46:1>
The social consequences of denying adopted children the
entitlement to right of abode under the Basic Law can , one hopes , be
alleviated by policy implemented through domestic legislation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#47:1>
For example , by legislating that adopted children whose adoption is
recognised by Hong Kong law shall be given permission to enter and remain in
Hong Kong , so that they would eventually gain permanent-resident status
after seven years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#48:1>
However , the legacy of a rule of interpretation that excludes
regard for human rights unless there is an ambiguity in the language will be
a serious setback .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#49:1>
It will take Hong Kong  ' s common-law development back to an obsolete
stage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#50:1>
Certainly , it will leave Hong Kong out of the full-steam-ahead
reception of human-rights values into the common law in England and Wales
following the recent enactment of the Human Rights Act , as explained by Lord
Woolf , the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales at a seminar held in Hong
Kong last Wednesday .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#51:1>
A British expert on the Act , Keir Starmer , reported the courts
there are now duty-bound to read and give effect to legislation in a way
which is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights , without
the need to find an ambiguity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#52:1>
It is ironic that Hong Kong  ' s highest court is prepared to
retreat , even as Lord Woolf acknowledges that the British Act learned much
from the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance in terms of advancing human
rights . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#53:1>
This retreat could cost Hong Kong its rights and freedom sooner
and more drastically than people may imagine . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#54:1>
One area is the imminent Article 23 legislation against treason ,
subversion , theft of state secrets and so on .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#55:1>
The other is the chilling effect of the Li Shaomin and Gao Zhan cases
on academic research and development .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#56:1>
Unless rights are rigorously upheld by the courts , they will
disappear quickly , and with it Hong Kong  ' s last foothold for being
considered a strong legal system underpinning the rule of law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#57:1>
Even now , evidence is being given before a court in Canada -
during a refugee hearing to decide whether Lai Changxing should be sent back
to face trial on the mainland - that the strongest assurance of a fair trial
taking place in China is political pressure and the glare of international
publicity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#58:1>
This is an abyss indeed . Unless Hong Kong draws back resolutely
, the date it will be drawn into it will not be as distant as some may choose
to believe . </p>

<bold> Democracy in recession </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> Margaret Ng </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#63:2>
<bold> IN LESS THAN </bold> two weeks , the SAR will have
completed its first five years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#64:2>
In the inevitable review of achievements and failures , one fact will
have to be faced: democracy has been weakened in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#65:2>
Of course , the obvious should not be denied .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#66:2>
The end of colonial rule must be regarded as a step towards democracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#67:2>
A chief executive selected among Hong Kong residents must be more
consistent with democracy than a governor sent by a distant monarch .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#68:2>
But it must be pointed out that these changes can be more form than
substance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#69:2>
As the &ldquo; re-election &rdquo; of Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa to a second term of five years clearly demonstrated , the selection
process makes a mockery of democratic election as it is ordinarily understood
, and a conservative Hong Kong resident chief executive can be more hostile
to democratisation than an enlightened British governor . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#70:2>
It is often said democracy in the Hong Kong context should be
judged within the framework of the Basic Law and not measured with the
yardstick of the United States or British models . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#71:2>
The Basic Law does provide a democracy of sorts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#72:2>
While Hong Kong executive power remains firmly in the hands of the
Beijing-appointed Chief Executive and principal officials , a real
democratic principle is also enshrined: the executive must abide by law , and
be accountable to a widely and locally elected legislature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#73:2>
Executive power is not democratically exercised , but the exercise of
executive power is democratically held in check . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#74:2>
The democratic system under the Basic Law is a system of checks
and balances .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#75:2>
The powers exercised by Mr Tung and his top officials are subject to
the checks and balances of Legco and the courts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#76:2>
Thus , in the Hong Kong context , the benchmarks of democracy are
the effectiveness of Legco in providing political checks and balances , the
strength of the rule of law safeguarded by an independent Judiciary , and the
full enjoyment of civil liberties by members of the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#77:2>
Measured against these benchmarks , the situation has decidedly
worsened .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#78:2>
The " divide and rule &rdquo; tactic has proved a tool of immense
value to the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#79:2>
Theoretically , the Democratic Party has the largest absolute number
of votes from the electorate and the largest number of seats in Legco , most
of them directly elected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#80:2>
Yet the Democratic Party is invariably defeated in any Legco vote
where it opposes the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#81:2>
However sound or moderate its criticism , and reflective of public
sentiment , it is defeated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#82:2>
Without a single seat in Legco , the Government has been able to
force through any vote it considers important . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#83:2>
Examples include the government request for a Basic Law
interpretation by the National People  ' s Congress Standing Committee in
Beijing after it lost its court battle on the first right of abode cases;
stopping the Public Order Ordinance from being reviewed; and introducing the
new ministerial system with extra funding for new posts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#84:2>
It is a safe bet that the controversial legislation to cut civil
service pay will also be approved in due course . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#85:2>
In each case , there was and is strong opposition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#86:2>
In each case the Government refused to allow time for consultation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#87:2>
In the case of the ministerial system , the Government did not bother
to hide the fact that the proposal was unresolved in essential details and
has not been carefully thought out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#88:2>
When it comes to timely information and explanation regarding
important policy decisions , the Government now deliberately bypasses Legco
with little concern .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#89:2>
The latest example is the decision to resume the sale of Home
Ownership Scheme flats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#90:2>
Chief Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen chose to make the announcement
at a press conference , ignoring Legco . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#91:2>
When an irate House Committee of Legco sought an explanation , Mr
Tsang said the Government would come to Legco first only on &ldquo; important
&rdquo; decisions requiring Legco  ' s support in passing legislation or
approving financial proposals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#92:2>
He added he avoided putting matters before Legco because members
tend to be confrontational and make negative comments .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#93:2>
This is atypical only in its unashamed frankness ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#94:2>
Looking ahead , the accountability system set to be implemented
on July 1 will not increase Hong Kong  ' s democracy but rather weaken it
further because checks and balances that still exist will be further weakened .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#95:2>
It is not that there is anything sacrosanct about the archaic
bureaucratic government model .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#96:2>
It is what the established system is being replaced with . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#97:2>
Despite its official name , the new accountability system in no
way increases accountability to Legco as stipulated in the Basic Law or
explained to the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#98:2>
Unlike the British system , the appointees have not been elected
into the legislature before being named &ldquo; ministers" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#99:2>
Unlike the US system , their appointments are not subject to the
endorsement of the legislature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#100:2>
They are handpicked by Mr Tung , with Beijing  ' s approval , and
are answerable only to him .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#101:2>
A minister who exercises executive power under the law is
accountable to the legislature .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#102:2>
Under the ministerial system , all statutory executive powers now
exercised by officials who are senior civil servants will be transferred to
the new ministers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#103:2>
None of them will be accountable to Legco for the power they will be
exercising . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#104:2>
Constitutional Affairs Secretary Michael Suen Ming-yeung has
rejected any suggestion a minister would resign upon a Legco vote of no
confidence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#105:2>
There will be less transparency rather than more .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#106:2>
It is claimed there will be more accountability in that the new
ministers will meet people and hear their views .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#107:2>
What that will mean is a more invasive propaganda machinery . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#108:2>
It is much easier to pull the wool over the eyes of the people
who have little time or interest to go into the details than to curb critical
Legco members whose job is to ask probing questions and demand relevant
documents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#109:2>
Bypassing Legco and opting for more walkabouts and media chats
is dodging vigorous scrutiny .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#110:2>
This is to create a more efficient government propaganda machine to
be controlled by the future director of the Chief Executive  ' s Office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#111:2>
It has been denied that the civil service has any role in
restraining the Government in wielding power and dictating policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#112:2>
We are told the role of the civil service and Exco is to support
and assist the Chief Executive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#113:2>
Yet any rational being is restrained by independent advice against
what he contemplates doing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#114:2>
In so far as the accountability system is introduced to meet Mr
Tung  ' s need to assert himself as the real boss , it will work to subdue the
civil service , not to encourage loyal , frank and independent advice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#115:2>
It is understandable for the Government to resist the criticism
of Legco out of mistrust .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#116:2>
That is why the critical assessment coming from within the civil
service is - or was - so invaluable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#117:2>
With that factor eliminated , and Legco marginalised , the
Government is poised to rule by the will of Mr Tung and his chosen few . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#118:2>
The neutralisation of all checks and balances will not assist
the progress of democracy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#119:2>
The next thing that will follow is to label as democracy what in
substance is plain authoritarianism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#120:2>
Civil liberties will be more exposed to curtailment than ever .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#121:2>
Already the process has started . Using a provision in the Public
Order Ordinance for the first time , the police recently arrested activist
Leung Kwok-hung and student leader Christopher Fung Ka-keung at their homes
for organising an unlawful assembly , an offence punishable by three years in
jail .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#122:2>
The offence stemmed from deliberate refusal to give the police
advance notice of a demonstration as required under the ordinance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#123:2>
The giving of notice on pain of disproportionate penalty was
strongly opposed by democrats who urged the Government last year to review
the law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#124:2>
The Government countered that the large number of demonstrations
since reunification proves civil liberties are even more alive than before ,
ignoring the obvious point that more people demonstrate because more people
are discontent , not because they are more free to express discontent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#125:2>
The latest police action will make the price of disobedience and
defiance much higher . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#126:2>
The rule of law was seriously shaken by the interpretation of
the Standing Committee in Beijing that overturned the Court of Final Appeal
decision on the right of abode .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#127:2>
This can happen again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-011#128:2>
The requirement under Article 23 of the Basic Law to legislate
against acts of treason , sedition , secession and other offences against the
state has been held in abeyance for five years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#129:2>
But democrats in Legco are being cornered .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#130:2>
The Democratic Party is expected to lose further ground in the next
Legco election .

<ICE-HK:W2B-011#131:2>
With the opposition vanquished , the way will be cleared for the
introduction of harsh laws . </p>
