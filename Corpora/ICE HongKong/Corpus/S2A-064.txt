<ICE-HK:S2A-064#1:1:A>
All the charges are brought under four different sections of
the Crimes Ordinance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#2:1:A>
Counts one and two relate to the offence of controlling a woman for
the purpose of prostitution under section one hundred and thirty <?> subsection </?> one

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#3:1:A>
Counts three and four relate to detaining a woman against her will
with intention she should have unlawful sexual intercourse with men under
section one hundred thirty four subsection one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#4:1:A>
Counts five seven nine and eleven <,> are offences of rape under
section one hundred eighteen subsection one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#5:1:A>
Counts six eight ten and twelve are offences of unlawful sexual
intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen under section one hundred
and twenty-four

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#6:1:A>
The last offence under section one hundred and twenty-four is an
alternative count to rape

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#7:1:A>
It  ' s not it  ' s only it  ' s only necessary for you to consider this
alternative if and only if you come to the conclusion that sexual intercourse
had in fact taken place <,> but it was with the consent of the girl

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#8:1:A>
Consent is not a defence to a charge under section <,> one hundred
and twenty-four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#9:1:A>
<?> It is also </?> no defence if the man believed that girl was
over sixteen or the fact that she looked very much older than her age <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#10:1:A>
Section one hundred and twenty-four provides <,> that a man who has
unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under age of sixteen shall be guilty
of an offence

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#11:1:A>
There  ' s clear and undisputed evidence that both girls were under
sixteen in July and August last year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#12:1:A>
Lam Wing Wah or Luk Suk the first accused <,> faces a total of
eight counts <,> and they are counts one to eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#13:1:A>
The first four counts being controlling and detaining a woman for
prostitution or for unlawful sexual intercourse with men <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#14:1:A>
Counts five to seven are counts of <,> rape alleging that uh he
raped Chung Nga Sin and Ng Hoi Yan

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#15:1:A>
Both counts six to eight of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl
under age of sixteen as alternatives

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#16:1:A>
Lit Ching Pui the third accused now only faces count nine of raping
Ng Hoi Yan and count ten of unlawful sexual intercourse as an alternative

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#17:1:A>
Counts eleven and twelve concern Lau Wing Kwan the second accused
who is charged with Chung Nga Sin with unlawful sexual intercourse as an
alternative <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#18:1:A>
I will turn now to the evidence and return to the law and the
individual charges later <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#19:1:A>
The only evidence against the accused really comes from the two
girls <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#20:1:A>
Without this evidence there  ' s absolutely nothing to support any of
these charges <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#21:1:A>
You did not hear any evidence from any accused because none of them
gave evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#22:1:A>
An accused is not obliged to give evidence of course

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#23:1:A>
He is entitled to sit in the dock and require the prosecution to
prove its case

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#24:1:A>
You must not assume that he is guilty because he has not given
evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#25:1:A>
The fact that he has not given evidence proves nothing <,> one way
or the other

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#26:1:A>
It does nothing to establish his guilt

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#27:1:A>
On the other hand it means that there  ' s no evidence from the
accused to undermine contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the
prosecution <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#28:1:A>
However you will still have to decide whether on the prosecution  ' s
evidence you are sure of the accused  ' s guilt <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#29:1:A>
You will also recall that serious allegations were put to the two
girls by counsel in cross-examination <,> but these allegations are not
evidence and they are not <unc> 1-word </unc> supported by any
evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#30:1:A>
Although none of the accused gave evidence but by agreement between
counsel it was placed before you as an admitted fact <,> that the first
accused is a man of forty-two years of age married with a son and has no
previous criminal conviction <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#31:1:A>
This is something you will <unc> 1-word </unc> take into
account in deciding whether the prosecution has made you sure of his guilt
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#32:1:A>
The fact that he is a man of good character supports his
credibility and having reached age of forty two without committing any
offence means that he  ' s less likely than otherwise might be the case to
commit a crime now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#33:1:A>
In the course of cross-examination the girls were asked about their
witness statements to the police

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#34:1:A>
There  ' s nothing unusual about these statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#35:1:A>
It  ' s an important requirement and established police uh uh
procedure and practice <,> that when a report of a crime is made <,>
statements were taken from the person who made the report and any person or
persons who can testify as to the event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#36:1:A>
It is on the basis and strength of these statements a decision as
to whether to prosecute or not is made by the appropriate authorities <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#37:1:A>
A witness statement made to the police in these circumstances is
not evidence in a trial <,> because a witness apparently can say anything in
the absence or <,> or challenge by the uh persons against whom the complaint
uh is made <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#38:1:A>
But the statement only becomes evidence <,> if the statement or any
part of the statement is adopted by the witness in the witness box <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#39:1:A>
If the witness denies it that does not become evidence <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#40:1:A>
But if a witness says something different from what he or she says
in the witness box is something that you will have to take into account and
ask why the witness has said different things at different times <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#41:1:A>
This will go to the credibility of the witness <,> and that is
whether you uh should be uh believe the evidence of the witness or not <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#42:1:A>
Now a good uh example is that in the witness box Chung Nga Sin said
it was Kei Kei and another girl who took her to Chi Fu Villa to receive
customers on the twenty-fourth of July <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#43:1:A>
But in one of her statements to the police <,> dated eight of
August she said it was Kei Kei and Ah Pui who took her there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#44:1:A>
Yet in another statement of the same day she said it was Luk Suk
that is the first accused who took her to this villa <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#45:1:A>
Chung Nga Sin gave an explanation about the uh discrepancies
between her her statements to the police and her evidence in the witness box
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#46:1:A>
She said that she was tired sleepy confused and upset at the time
she gave the statements and she made mistakes

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#47:1:A>
It  ' s entirely a matter for you whether you find this <.> ex </.>
explanation acceptable or not <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#48:1:A>
The girls were asked in cross examination if they read uh their
witness statements before they came to give evidence in court <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#49:1:A>
And both of them of course told you that they did

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#50:1:A>
There is nothing wrong about that nothing sinister <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#51:1:A>
Witnesses are entitled to refresh their memory from statements
which they make shortly after the events <,> and I don't think uh uh you
should really uh place too much importance on this aspect <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#52:1:A>
You have uh these uh uh uh remarks I don't think I need labor any
further on this <,> on this aspect

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#53:1:A>
It is undisputed evidence that in the early hours <,> and that was
shortly before three am on eighth of August nineteen ninety three <,> Chung
Nga Sin Ng Hoi Yan who were accompanied by Mr Chung Wing Ching the father of
Chung Nga Sin made a report to Yuen Long Police Station

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#54:1:A>
As a result <unc> 1-word </unc> a police party went to Chit
Wing Building <,> and arrested a total of ten persons among whom <.> a </.>
among whom were the accused

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#55:1:A>
The uh first accused was arrested on the ground floor of the
building <,> whereas the others were arrested inside the flat

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#56:1:A>
In July last year Chung Nga Sin was a girl who did not like school

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#57:1:A>
She liked beautiful and fancy dresses and wore make-up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#58:1:A>
She smoked and drank

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#59:1:A>
She frequented billiard rooms and karaoke <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#60:1:A>
She was fun loving and had run away from home several times <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#61:1:A>
She was brought before the court and a protection order was made
against her placing her under the custody of her father and a social welfare
officer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#62:1:A>
She was later sent to a girl  ' s home for uh the breaching that
order <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#63:1:A>
She came from a home where her parents were divorced <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#64:1:A>
Quite obviously she was out of control <,> but she was only
thirteen years and two months old

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#65:1:A>
She was born on twenty sixth May nineteen eighty according to the
birth certificate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#66:1:A>
You may think members of the jury that Chung Nga Sin and by the
same token Ng Hoi Yan <,> were ideal and easy targets for people who have the
evil mind to engage in sex business <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#67:1:A>
But that that is a matter for you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#68:1:A>
Chung Nga Sin whose nickname is Crystal told you that in July last
year she met Kei Kei who was the fifth accused at the Hung Kei Billiard Room
in Yuen Long

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#69:1:A>
They later became friends <,> and one day which she believed uh uh
was twenty third July last year Kei Kei took her to the flat in Chit Wing
Building introduced her to the first accused and Ah Sze who was the fourth
accused <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#70:1:A>
She went out with Kei Kei for shopping

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#71:1:A>
When they returned to the flat at about six pm Kei Kei told her to
go into a room in the presence of the first accused Ah Sze Shirley and Ah Wai
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#72:1:A>
Inside the room Kei Kei asked her to do private hours

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#73:1:A>
She understood <?> to have </?> sexual intercourse with men for
money <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#74:1:A>
She said no to her and Kei Kei told her that she was pregnant and
could not do it herself <,> and asked for her help

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#75:1:A>
She again refused and Kei Kei <,> threaten to beat her up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#76:1:A>
After that the first accused Ah Wai Shirley and Ah Sze came into
the room

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#77:1:A>
She was very scared and Shirley told her that if she was smart and
obedient she would not be beaten up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#78:1:A>
Eventually she agreed

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#79:1:A>
After that the first accused Ah Wai Shirley and Ah Sze left the
room leaving her and Kei Kei who suggested that she should uh borrow money
from the first accused <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#80:1:A>
She identified the borrowing note Exhibit P thirteen as the piece
of paper she was asked to sign <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#81:1:A>
This paper was dated seventeenth of July <,> and it was suggested
by the defence that that was the day that this note was made <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#82:1:A>
Chung Nga Sin said that after signing this piece of paper the uh
first accused gave her two thousand dollars which she handed to Kei Kei

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#83:1:A>
She said that some time after eleven pm Kei Kei told her to receive
<,> the uh first customer who was Luk Suk the first accused

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#84:1:A>
She was very scared and was afraid that Luk Suk might disturb her

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#85:1:A>
Luk Suk told her uhm uhm told her to go into a room and she did as
she was told because if she did not she feared that that she might be beaten
up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#86:1:A>
Inside the room she told Luk Suk that she did not want to take a
bath when she was told to uh do so and did not want to make love with him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#87:1:A>
Luk Suk pressed her down onto the bed with his hand

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#88:1:A>
She was very frightened and tried to push him away but uh wasn't
successful because he was stronger than she

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#89:1:A>
She also shouted out for help <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#90:1:A>
Luk Suk then inserted his penis into her vagina and moved for a
while and withdrew

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#91:1:A>
She noticed some liquid <,> in red colour from her vagina

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#92:1:A>
She said that she was a virgin before that <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#93:1:A>
Subsequently she was taken to Chi Fu Villa and the Palace Villa to
receive customers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#94:1:A>
The uh first time she was taken to Chi Fu Villa by Kei Kei and
another female <,> but you will remember that uh in her police <,> statements
she said it was either Luk Suk who took her there or Kei Kei and Ah Pui <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#95:1:A>
She said on the other occasions <,> it was either <,> Kei Kei Luk
Suk Ah Sze and Shirley <,> who uh took her there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#96:1:A>
Three or two or three of them are would uh take her each time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#97:1:A>
She said that in the course of that week she received five to seven
customers each day <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#98:1:A>
In the early hours of twenty-ninth July <,> while she was lying on
the bed in room A trying to go to sleep the second accused came in

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#99:1:A>
He touched her

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#100:1:A>
He she had seen the first second accused before in the flat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#101:1:A>
She was sleeping in a single bed with Kei Kei and Ng Hoi Yan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#102:1:A>
The uh second accused took off his clothes

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#103:1:A>
She was very scared and tried to push Ng Hoi Yan in order to wake
her up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#104:1:A>
She also shouted help help wake up wake up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#105:1:A>
But there was no uh response <,> and she later told you that uh
because Ng Hoi Yan was drunk <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#106:1:A>
But you may think members of jury even if Ng Hoi Yan was not drunk
could she have been able to help her in these circumstances or would she dare
to help her knowing that Kei Kei was sleeping on the same bed next to her <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#107:1:A>
It will not be surprising that Kei Kei deliberately turned a blind
eye if you uh believe the evidence of the girls about the part Kei Kei had
been playing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#108:1:A>
The second accused then took off Chung Nga Sin  ' s dress and
underpants <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#109:1:A>
He told her not to shout or he would beat her up

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#110:1:A>
She was very scared

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#111:1:A>
She tried to push him away but unsuccessful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#112:1:A>
The second accused inserted his penis into her vagina vagina and
moved about for three to four minutes before withdrawing

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#113:1:A>
She said that she did not consent to have sexual intercourse with
him

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#114:1:A>
The uh second accused then left the room

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#115:1:A>
She said that she stayed there for another five to six days after
this incident <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-064#116:1:A>
She agreed that she had been to uh see a doctor <,> about a
disease in her private part but she was unable to remember the date and the
details </I>
