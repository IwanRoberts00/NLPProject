Ha Ha , Irene &obrack; or So Ling ? &cbrack; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#3:1>
I received your birthday card yesterday &obrack; the exact day of my
B-day ! &cbrack; , thanks a lot , but sorry for not sending you one in turn .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#4:1>
I &ldquo; finger &rdquo; you and figured out your last login was
Jan 20 15:57 , that was just 3 hours ago !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#5:1>
And at that time I was using computer also ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#6:1>
I missed you ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#7:1>
That's really bad as if I figured out you are logging on , we could
then &ldquo; talk &rdquo; to each other !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#8:1>
By the way , do you know we can use computer to <-> tale </-> <+> talk
</+> ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#9:1>
And would you like to talk to me if you have time ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#10:1>
Actually why do you open an account ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#11:1>
You have some friends overseas that you can communicate with them
thro ' email ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#12:1>
Or &ldquo; people have I have &rdquo; ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#13:1>
Ask Chan Wing Kai &obrack; if you have chance &cbrack; more about
that if you would like , as I think he knows much about that ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#14:1>
Once again , thanks a lot for your B-day , and I am looking forward
to hearing from you !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#15:1>
&obrack; And say happy birthday to you too ! &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#18:2>
Hi , So Ling ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#19:2>
feel weird as I call you So Ling ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#20:2>
Ha Ha , I think it is &ldquo; good listen ! &rdquo;

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#21:2>
I think you know how to read mail , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#22:2>
So , it is simple to know how to send one then .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#23:2>
Please read the following &ldquo; instruction &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#24:2>
1. After you successfully logon the hkuxa system &obrack; or the
hkuxb , never mind , but I think you should persistently use one of them !
&cbrack; , you see &ldquo; hkuxa &cbrack; &rdquo; , right ? Ok , then ....
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#25:2>
2. After the prompt hkuxa &cbrack; , type &ldquo; mail my e-mail
address &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#26:2>
3. It will then appear &ldquo; Subject : &rdquo; on the other line .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#27:2>
Don't start your letter yet , as you should put a &ldquo; subject
&rdquo; on your mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#28:2>
4. Then you can start your mail to ME on a new line by &ldquo;
Dearest Lap Chung &rdquo; or whatsoever !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#29:2>
5. You may find it is not possible to edit &obrack; i.e. change
something or go back to the previous lines &cbrack; your mail by the cursors
&obrack; top , left , right , down &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#30:2>
Simply press shift cursors and you can use your cursors &ldquo;
normally &rdquo; !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#31:2>
6. To send a mail , type &ldquo; . &rdquo; on a NEW and LAST line of
the BEGINNING of your mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#32:2>
You mail is then automatically sent !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#33:2>
Understand ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#34:2>
I don't know whether my instruction is perfectly correct as the
system in HKU may different from those in my university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#35:2>
Anyway , waiting for your reply !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#36:2>
Lap Chung

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#37:2>
P.S. You are welcome to send me letters &ldquo; physically
&rdquo; , but I prefer to send mail electronically ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#38:2>
As it is faster and easier !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#39:2>
Ha Ha !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#40:2>
And I think why I need to send a mail to &ldquo; Fat rooster &rdquo;
for you if I can send mail to you thro ' email ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#41:2>
&obrack; It is a good excuse for my laziness ! &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#42:2>
By the way , you are available between 12-3 on every Monday and
Thursday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#43:2>
Great .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#44:2>
It is Seattle time 8pm-11pm Sunday and Wednesday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#45:2>
Maybe I would come @ 8pm tomorrow night and see if you are here !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#46:2>
Ha , I need to tell you how to figure out whether I have logged on
the computer or not . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#47:2>
hkuxa &cbrack &obrack; this is what appeared on the screen &cbrack;
&obrack; type &cbrack; finger e-mail address 1 OR &obrack; type &cbrack;
finger e-mail address 2

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#48:2>
I am usually at one of that 2 machines , try and you will read: Last
login FEB 19 0:15 ...... OR On Since FEB 21 22 : 18 ....

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#49:2>
It tells you when my &ldquo; Last login &rdquo; time or I am
simply here !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#50:2>
If it is the latter case , you can try to &ldquo; talk &rdquo; to me
by typing &ldquo; talk e-mail address 2 &rdquo; ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#51:2>
Don't try the machine called shelley ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#52:2>
it is not &ldquo; talkable &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#53:2>
Sometimes I tried to &ldquo; talk &rdquo; to my former classmates in
HKU ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#54:2>
it is frustrating as the HKU network is dumb !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#55:2>
So dumb that you can hardly connect to talk to each other !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#56:2>
So it you gonna to try to talk to me but <-> unsuccess </-> <+>
unsuccessful </+> , please don't feel upset , it is usually like that ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#57:2>
Oops !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#58:2>
I have nearly &ldquo; created &rdquo; another passage as my &ldquo;
P.S. &rdquo; !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#59:2>
Gonna stop now ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#60:2>
CU &obrack; see you ! &cbrack;

I was on the system !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#79:4>
But I was doing another thing &obrack; typing paper &cbrack; such
that I missed the chance to talk to you ..... too bad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#80:4>
Anyway , I should keep in mind you are available every Monday and
Thursday afternoon , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#81:4>
Hey , why do you have time to go to Shenzhen ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#82:4>
And what do you look like now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#83:4>
Why I need to surprise ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#84:4>
I think you may have a long long hair &obrack; ? &cbrack; &obrack;
Wait , really ? ? ? &cbrack; , or dress like a lady &obrack; ? ? &cbrack; ,
or on the contrary , you shaved all your hair ? ? ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#85:4>
Ha Ha !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#86:4>
Too many wild guesses , tell me next time !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#87:4>
And of course if you have some good pictures , send to me

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#88:4>
let me have a look of it !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#89:4>
I remembered you asked me to send some pictures to you , and I have
sent to you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#90:4>
Or not ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#91:4>
Anyway , as a &ldquo; trade &rdquo; , I will send to you some of my
recent pictures here ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#92:4>
they are really interesting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#93:4>
I am going to have my finals next week , and then we will have a
ten-day break .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#94:4>
I will join a trip for international students to go to east
Washington &obrack; the eastern part of the Washington state &cbrack; and see
the agricultural industry there &obrack; i.e. to see a large large piece of
farmland with endless green ! &cbrack; and visit the red Indian reservation
area .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#95:4>
Hope it will be interesting &obrack; and romantic ! &cbrack; </p>

Hey , Irene ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#100:5>
why you appear on Wednesday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#101:5>
This gives me no preparation to send you a mail !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#102:5>
It is not my fault !

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#103:5>
I am going to have my spring break from 18 &obrack; after the
morning exam &cbrack; to 28 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#104:5>
And I will go to join the international students trip , as I have
mentioned , from 20 to 25 &semi; so it is not possible for me to send you
mails in the period !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#105:5>
Forgive me !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#106:5>
I am good luck of course , and good look &obrack; ? &cbrack; ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#107:5>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#108:5>
You have a contact lens ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#109:5>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#115:5>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#116:5>
And yes , I gave your account to Kai Kai , and his is &ldquo;

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-006#117:5>
Are you going to come to the computer room in a few hours ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#118:5>
Maybe I will be there too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#119:5>
You said you wanted to &ldquo; trade &rdquo; with me ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#120:5>
Ha ha , no way , it is you who told me everything ..

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#121:5>
&obrack; I am taking a class of microeconomics &cbrack; , so your
&ldquo; secrets &rdquo; are &ldquo; free goods &rdquo; but mine is scarcity ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#141:7>
No one teaches her ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#142:7>

who he is !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#143:7>
His email address is hxxxxxxx@hkuxa.hku.hk .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#144:7>
Ah , one more , and please tell Irene , too if you two still

if you like , send an email to him &obrack; but as he is really busy now , he
seldom goes to check emails &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#155:8>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#176:10>
If I pass , I can have private tutorial of my violin by some

I really played so weird when I tried to practise this afternoon ,
so don't bless me ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#178:10>

Well , if you have &dollar;30000 , you can travel the whole US !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#187:11>
I think you just need &dollar;15000 to visit the west coast for 2
weeks &obrack; including visiting the Disneyland of course !

Well , you are wrong , I am too lazy and I just got some of my

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#201:12>
Surely I will send one or two if you like .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#202:12>
But they are not very good pictures .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#203:12>
The other reason why I was lazy was I got into my university
hospital for a night 3 weeks ago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#204:12>
My stomach bleeding again &obrack; ulcer &cbrack; and I am totally
fine now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#205:12>
They gave me 500cc blood too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#206:12>
Ha , guess how much is the hospital fee ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#207:12>
It's really amusing .... &obrack; a lot ! &cbrack; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#208:12>

My dear Vladimir ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#215:13>
It  ' s so nice to hear from you again !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#216:13>
I'm sorry that I haven't written to you before because I was very
busy with my exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#217:13>
My summer holidays wi1l begin in 13/7 ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#218:13>
what about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#219:13>
How is your exam anyway ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#220:13>
I have heard about the economic situation in Russia and Ukraine
from newspapers and I think it is terrible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#221:13>
People always have to join the long queues in order to get their
basic necessities .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#222:13>
I do really hope that all the chaos will be gone soon and the
people in your country will enjoy political and economic stability .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#223:13>
I am going to be in university next year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#224:13>
Recently , I am thinking about what subjects should I choose to
study and it is hard for me to make a decision .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#225:13>
I would probably pick translation or linguistics because I am very
interested in languages .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#226:13>
I was quite upset about the death of Kurt Cobain &dash; my
favourite rockstar in the US .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#227:13>
Have you ever heard of him ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#228:13>
He committed suicide in April .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#229:13>
People looked to Nirvana &obrack; his band &cbrack; because their
songs captured what they felt before they knew they felt it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#230:13>
Lots of people started to ask why he committed suicide and
concluded by saying that he just could not cope with the stress of being a
super rockstar .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#231:13>
To me , although the loss of Kurt Cobain is tragic , I do not see
it is necessary to judge him on why he left and how .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#232:13>
One cannot understand the pain that lies in another  ' s head , heart
and soul .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#233:13>
I  ' m not an advocate of suicides , yet I understand what motivates
one to take such drastic measures to ease inner pain .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#234:13>
Those measures need to be examined with sensitive eyes , not
judgmental ones .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#235:13>
Vladimir , I am proud of being your pen-friend because though you
have to face so many problems in you life , you still try to be positive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#236:13>
That is very good !

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#237:13>
I hope you will keep up with this attitude .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#238:13>
If you are unhappy or whatsoever , please write and tell me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#239:13>
I will be here for you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#240:13>
Well , I have to go now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#241:13>
Write to me when you have time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#242:13>
Please send my love to your family .

<ICE-HK:W1B-006#243:13>
Love always , </I>
