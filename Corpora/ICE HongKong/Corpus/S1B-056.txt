<ICE-HK:S1B-056#1:1:A>
Mr Deputy President I refrain from telling fairy tales because
I  ' ve done it quite enough

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#2:1:A>
I have to do it every night when I try to put my daughters to bed
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#3:1:A>
I welcome the Governor speech <,> although there are areas I have
doubts <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#4:1:A>
On the whole <,> it is cleverly crafted and packaged <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#5:1:A>
That is why it has received such wide support even though the
spending proposals are well within our fiscal guidelines <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#6:1:A>
I  ' m glad to hear that the government  ' s approach to business will
remain one of minimum interference and maximum support <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#7:1:A>
I  ' m glad to know <,> that we will provide more assistance to those
in genuine need <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#8:1:A>
I also welcome the establishment of the Governor Business Council
<,> which has gone a long way <,> to allay the business sector  ' s fear over
the fast pace of the outline democratic development in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#9:1:A>
The experience and insight of the members of the Business Council
should provide useful input to the government in formulating business
policies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#10:1:A>
Since many of my colleagues have already commented extensively on
the Governor  ' s policy proposals I will confine my comments to a few specific
areas which I feel strongly <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#11:1:A>
The first area is competition <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#12:1:A>
I agree with the Governor that competition <,> is the key to our
economic success <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#13:1:A>
It holds down costs <,> raises efficiencies <,> and benefits
consumers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#14:1:A>
We must therefore <,> allow as much competition as possible in each
and every sector of our economy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#15:1:A>
However <,> we also have to bear in mind that competition is only a
means to an end

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#16:1:A>
The end is whether consumers can benefit <,> and equally important
whether the market would continue to deliver goods and services at a speed
and with such quality that the society  ' s demands can be fully met <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#17:1:A>
While competition is conducive to consumer protection <,> we must
avoid equating competition to consumer protection <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#18:1:A>
If we look at the complaints made to the Consumer Council we will
find that many of these complaints are not in areas where we lack competition
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#19:1:A>
Rather many of those complaints are on unethical business practices
of individual businessmen who cannot face competition and therefore have to
resort to unethical and indeed illegal means to generate revenue <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#20:1:A>
In addressing this issue the government must distinguish between
unethical business practices of individual businessmen <,> such as some
electrical appliances shops <,> and some second-hand car dealers <,> and
genuine collusion on an industry-wide basis <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#21:1:A>
It must also bear in mind that competition does not lie in the
number of suppliers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#22:1:A>
If there is no surplus production capacity <,> there will be no
competition <,> regardless of the number of suppliers because suppliers find
no incentive to compete when demand outstrips supply <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#23:1:A>
I would like to lay down the criteria of how I see a good
competition policy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#24:1:A>
A good competition policy should encourage production <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#25:1:A>
It should encourage investors to <.> pro </.> to produce more <,>
better goods and services

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#26:1:A>
It should eliminate whatever non-market barriers to entry for
newcomers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#27:1:A>
A good competition policy should recognize the limit on the optimum
number of firms imposed by the size of the market and do not sacrifice
efficiency for competition <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#28:1:A>
A good competition policy should recognize the need for market
stability <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#29:1:A>
In industries where stability is essential to the society <,> we
have to accept arrangements of markets participants provided <,> that such
arrangements are transparent <,> known to the public and produce benefits
without penalizing consumers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#30:1:A>
In other words <,> these arrangements are not used by firms for
profit maximization <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#31:1:A>
Some colleagues have ask for more legislations and more watchdog
bodies to protect consumers <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#32:1:A>
While I  ' ll support any legislation which would give consumers more
protection <,> I  ' m sceptical about legislations which would discord distort
markets and resource allocations <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#33:1:A>
Indeed I think I oppose those legislations

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#34:1:A>
We must allow market forces full play <,> if we want genuine and
not artificial competition <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#35:1:A>
Already there are legislations giving customers the <?> full </?>
redress against unscrupulous business practices

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#36:1:A>
However consumers seldom resort to legal proceedings because of the
troubles they have to go through in undertaking such an act <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#37:1:A>
I also disagree with the setting up of more committees or quangos
as watchdogs <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#38:1:A>
The Consumer Council has done a great job and we should continue to
support their work <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#39:1:A>
The need for more official bodies for consumer protection is not
there <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#40:1:A>
I  ' m glad to hear the government  ' s plan to form a Monetary
Authority after months of speculation in Hong Kong on whether we would have
one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#41:1:A>
Many commentators have welcomed the idea <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#42:1:A>
But I must admit <,> that I have not been thrilled to death by this
piece of news <,> for the simple reason that the government has said nothing
about the role of the Monetary Authority <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#43:1:A>
Before I know the details of its power <,> its structure and how it
would ensure monetary stability I would reserve my judgment <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#44:1:A>
If it is just a new name for two existing monetary departments <,>
or what Mr Andrew Wong call old wine in a new bottles I do not see how I
should feel elated <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#45:1:A>
If it if it is more than a name I would like to know what benefits
it will bring to the people of Hong Kong and the financial community <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#46:1:A>
Nevertheless <,> knowing the talents of our monetary officials I
believe we will benefit from this restructuring <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#47:1:A>
I do not agree with the idea of an independent Monetary Authority
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#48:1:A>
Hong Kong is too small <,> to have two independent <.> ec </.>
economic decision making bodies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#49:1:A>
The last thing the financial market wants to see is the government  ' s
left arm fighting with the right arm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#50:1:A>
As a volunteer in the field of rehabilitation I welcome the
Governor  ' s proposals to increase spending in this area <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#51:1:A>
We must do more for the less fortunate members of our society <,>
particularly disabled children <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#52:1:A>
We have to ensure that more resources are <.> re </.> assigned to
special schools <,> and normal schools with handicapped children <,> so that
they have the resources to perform their tasks

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#53:1:A>
While I welcome the provision of more residential facilities for
the disabled I would strongly urge the government to pay more attention to
the issue of employment of the disabled <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#54:1:A>
Rehabilitation is not just helping handicapped people to overcome
their disabilities <,> but rather to help them to live a useful life through
work <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#55:1:A>
Perhaps the Governor does not know <,> while he was promising more
resources for rehabilitation <,> the resources the government put in helping
the disabled to get jobs have actually been cut back

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#56:1:A>
I  ' ve just found out that the number of placement officers in the
Labour Department to help the disabled to get jobs has actually been reduced
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#57:1:A>
Now what is the point of training up the disabled and then sending
them directly to sheltered homes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#58:1:A>
My colleagues on the Rehabilitation Employment Sub-committee have
urged me to draw this to the Governor  ' s attention <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#59:1:A>
I welcome the formation of an Efficiency Unit in government and the
publication of performances pledges <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#60:1:A>
The Governor has listed several examples <,> but in my view they
are the easy ones and are far from sufficient <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#61:1:A>
The government should publish for each department a set of
performance standards in the next six months <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#62:1:A>
I fully appreciate the practical problems <,> but the Governor
should try very hard to ensure that his pledge to increase civil service
efficiency is supported by the whole Civil Service <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#63:1:A>
If a government department fails to come up with performance
standards they should explain publicly why <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#64:1:A>
To be honest <,> I remain sceptical whether <.> an </.> any real
achievement could be made in this regard but I will keep an open mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#65:1:A>
The constitutional development package outlined by the Governor <,>
if <.> imdi </.> implemented would give Hong Kong a pace of democracy even
faster than the Omelco consensus

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#66:1:A>
Let  ' s be honest <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#67:1:A>
Although the proposals themselves are not in the breach of the
Basic Law <,> it would in fact give Hong Kong thirty-nine directly elected
seats in nineteen ninety-five <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#68:1:A>
While no one would and can argue against democracy <,> we have to
bear in mind that democracy is only a means and not an end <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#69:1:A>
We must not lose sight of the final objectives of government <,>
and our political system which are freedom prosperity and stability <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#70:1:A>
Although democracy is the best system of government <,> it is not
perfect <,> and it has its problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#71:1:A>
We only have to look at the United Kingdom if we want to find a
real example <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#72:1:A>
I will support a faster pace of democracy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#73:1:A>
I just hope that we are ready for it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#74:1:A>
I have great doubts about the formation of a ten-member Legco
Committee <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#75:1:A>
This is not a healthy arrangement because it would deprive members
who are not on the committee the opportunity to discuss government policies
directly with the three heads of government <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#76:1:A>
I do not know the background to this proposal <,> and I cannot help
but think that this idea might have been influenced by Mr Patten  ' s
experience in the British parliament

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#77:1:A>
Their meetings are much less orderly <,> and personal abuses
abundant <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#78:1:A>
I can assure him that our in-house meetings are nothing like that
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#79:1:A>
If the first meeting we had with him two weeks ago <,> is any guide
he should know that he has no trouble handling this lot <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#80:1:A>
In the last session <,> Exco decisions are discussed in our Omelco
in-house meetings

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#81:1:A>
Despite the large numbers of <.> mem </.> large number of members
present discussions were orderly and useful <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#82:1:A>
Each member had a chance to voice their opinions and concerns on
each Exco decision that was put on the table <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#83:1:A>
I do not see how a ten-member committee can <.> re </.> represent
the wide range of views of this council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#84:1:A>
I therefore urge the Governor withdraw this proposal <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#85:1:A>
Come directly to Legco and explain his policies to all the members
rather than just a handful <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#86:1:A>
I for one <,> will not be bound by any decision of such committee
and I will vote according to how I see the policies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#87:1:A>
Sir with these remarks I support the motion <O> speeches-by-members
</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-056#88:1:B>
Mr Deputy President in the Governor  ' s speech the section on
livelihood is a typical example of how successful creation of wealth can
improve the quality of life in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#89:1:B>
This section draws widespread acclaim in our population <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#90:1:B>
On the health policy the pressing issue current <.> issu </.>
currently includes <,> the lack of adequate numbers of hospital beds
particularly infirmary beds the lack of funds to meet the escalating cost of
providing health service <,> the expected high cost of meeting health
requirements of an aging population and the unsatisfactory standard of
service in the public health sector <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#91:1:B>
For the first three issues appropriate planning and injection of
adequate money from the windfall surplus last year as proposed in the
Governor  ' s policy speech <,> should deal with them well <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#92:1:B>
In dealing with the problem of an ageing population <,> shifting
remedial therapy in the elderly which is expensive to preventive management
by health screening which is cheap <,> is what I have been personally
propounding for two years <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#93:1:B>
A pilot project has now proven that this policy is an effective way
to reduce health expenditure <,> and to preserve working capability of our
ageing population <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#94:1:B>
However I need to add <.> tha </.> that the screening for health
problems in the elderly at the age of sixty-five years as proposed in the
policy speech <,> is too late <,> for degenerative diseases start before the
age of forty years <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#95:1:B>
Nevertheless sixty-five years would be an acceptable starting point
for this new policy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#96:1:B>
Government must now make additional facilities available for
managing patients who have been found to have sub-clinical diseases <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#97:1:B>
The fourth pressing health issue that of unsatisfactory service in
the public sector is merely skimmed in the policy address <,> presumably left
to the ingenuity of the Hospital Authority <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#98:1:B>
I wish to suggest that the key to the solution lies in two
direction

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#99:1:B>
First the change from stale central planning to a responsive
market-oriented service centred on patient demands and feedbacks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#100:1:B>
Second <,> to introduce an element of viable competition between
the public and private health sectors and within the public sector itself
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#101:1:B>
The only major criticism in the health area is uh that the
so-called increase in real spending of twenty-two per cent till nineteen
ninety-seven is more apparent than real <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#102:1:B>
Averaged out the additional spending yields four point four per
cent extra per year <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#103:1:B>
Added to an expected rate of general inflation of nine to ten per
cent per annum this yields an annual growth in spending of only about
fourteen per cent <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#104:1:B>
However medical inflation <,> that is the increase in the cost of
treating the same diseases inclusive of advance in medical technology <,>
averages fifteen per cent per annum over the last five years <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#105:1:B>
Therefore there is no real growth in health spending

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#106:1:B>
Improved service still has to come from better management of the
health care system <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-056#107:1:B>
This government and Hospital Authority must pursue in future </I>
