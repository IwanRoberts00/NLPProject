With its unspoilt coastline and sublime beauty , Danang in Vietnam
is a veritable paradise .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#3:1>
Just over an hour  ' s flying time from Hong Kong , it offers the
perfect weekend gateway , writes <bold> Angelica Cheung </bold> </p> <O> Four
photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#4:1>
<bold> Furama Resort , top , is just a short drive from
interesting historical and cultural sites , including Marble Mountains ,
center , a cave-bedecked Buddhist shrine that was once home to Viet Cong
guerillas .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#5:1>
The local kids , above , welcome visitors to what has become , with
good reason , one of their country  ' s premier tourist destinations </bold>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#6:1>
<bold> I </bold> N the space of five years , Ho Xuan Khuong has
gone from languishing behind bars in the crowded boat people camps in Hong
Kong to rubbing shoulders with Oscar-winning Hollywood stars . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#7:1>
The affable 36-year-old Vietnamese , now the recreation supervisor
at the Furama Resort in Danang , spent six years incarcerated in the camps ,
passing the long days learning English and Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#8:1>
These skills proved useful after he was ultimately shipped back to
Vietnam . When Furama - the first five-star hotel in Danang - opened , Khuong
was hired and has already been promoted three times . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#9:1>
Recently , he was among the staff pampering Oscar-winner actor
Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser , star of <it> The Mummy Returns </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#10:1>
The British veteran actor spent two weeks at the resort , lounging
around the pool , running on the beach and working out in the gym during the
day .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#11:1>
By night , Caine and his American co-star were filming <it> The Quiet
American </it> , an adaptation of Graham Greene  ' s classic , in the
neighbouring port town of Hoi An . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#12:1>
&ldquo; Michael Caine was a nice guy , although most of us were
not sure who he was , apart from that he was obviously a huge foreign movie
star , &rdquo; says Khuong , whose main job is to coach guests in sports
activities on the resort , ranging from tennis and scuba-diving , to
water-skiing and kite-flying . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#13:1>
It  ' s not difficult to see why Caine and his fellow cast members
enjoyed he place so much .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#14:1>
Located on the renowned China Beach , a 30-kilometre stretch of
golden sand , the four-year-old resort tastefully combines Vietnamese
architecture , French interiors and high-tech comforts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#15:1>
And it is no coincidence the Furama chose Danang as the location
for its &dollar;300 million investment .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#16:1>
Vietnam  ' s third-largest city , halfway between Ho Chi Mihn City and
Hanoi , has all the essential elements to turn itself into a major gateway
destination: its year-round warm climate , endless pristine beaches , lush
green mountains , close-by historical relics , French colonial buildings and
friendly people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#17:1>
The area was once the kingdom of Champa , which existed between
the 12th and 17th centuries .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#18:1>
The Chams , who adopted Hinduism , are best known for the many brick
sanctuaries they constructed throughout central Vietnam .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#19:1>
A fine collection of their art can be found at the Cham Museum in
Danang . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#20:1>
A three-hour bus ride from Danang , followed by a bumpy journey
through the hills in left-behind American Jeeps , lies My Son , the spiritual
center of the ancient Cham civilsation .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#21:1>
My son is like a miniature version of Angkor Wat in Cambdia .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#22:1>
The valley became a religious focal point in the late fourth century
and remained in use for almost 1,000 years . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#23:1>
Just as fascinating , and far easier to reach , is the historical
city of Hoi An , only 30 minutes down the coast road from Danang .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#24:1>
At its monthly lantern festival , on full-moon night , lights in the
old quarter are turned off and the streets are lit with colourful paper
lanterns . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#25:1>
The idea came from Hoi An  ' s controversial mayor , Nguyen Su ,
who believes that the city  ' s economic future lies in preserving and
promoting its historical relics and rich culture .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#26:1>
To prevent the city from losing its authentic flavour , the
government even regulates the height of buildings and the kinds of wood and
paint that can be used . </p> <O> Two photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#27:1>
<bold> Ho Xuan Khuong , above , keeps things lively at Danang  ' s
gorgeous Furama Resort on China Beach , where lifeguards , right , to see the
welfare of visitors some three decades after American Gls called the beach
their favourite off-duty R&R locale </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#28:1>
A short drive away , for various fit enough to climb a few
hundred stone steps , lies Marble Mountain , traditionally known as Mountains
of the Five Elements .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#29:1>
During the height of the Vietnam War , Viet Cong guerillas cheekily
used one of the caves as a temporary hospital , even though it was within
strolling distance of the American military base at Danang .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#30:1>
The cave is now a Buddhist shrine . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#31:1>
Compared to the other resort destinations in Asia , Danang is
certainly a newcomer .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#32:1>
Still underdeveloped , its roads are bumpy , street lighting is
sporadic and the local people  ' s English is limited .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#33:1>
But its mild tropical climate , rural flavour and lack of any
significant development give it an advantage over crowded destinations such
as Phuket in Thailand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#34:1>
A new three-day , two-night package , offered jointly by Furama
Resort and Pacific Airlines , makes Danang an expecially convenient weekend
gateway for Hong Kong people: the package price of around &dollar;4,000 is
similar to those offered to Phuket , but the journey is far easier .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#35:1>
Just over an hour after leaving Hong Kong , the plane touches down in
Danang .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#36:1>
A quick 10-minute drive and visitors are at the Furama Resort , where
they can enjoy its swimming pools , lagoons , a variety of water sports on
the beach and spa treatments - at a third of what it would cost in Hong Kong .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#37:1>
This stretch of coastline is unlikely to remain undiscovered for
long .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#38:1>
The local government has been investing heavily in developing tourism
with the aim of turing the region into &ldquo; another Phuket &rdquo; in 10
years .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#39:1>
Two more international resort will be completed in the next few years
and Furama is planning to build an 18-hole golf course and club house with
guest rooms at Marble Mountains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#40:1>
A key figure in this effort is Paul Stoll , the general manager
of the Furama Resort , who also advises the local government on destination
development .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#41:1>
Recently he became the first foreigner to be presented with a
personal certificates of merit from the Vietnamese government in recognition
of his tireless efforts .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#42:1>
In fact , the German native , who worked at Hong Kong  ' s Furama Hotel
in the early 1990s , is so committed to Danang that he has decided to make it
his home for life . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#43:1>
&ldquo; Since I first came here in 1994 , everything has changed
, &rdquo; Stoll says .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#44:1>
&ldquo; The old-fashioned Russian turbojets have been replaced by
Airbus aircraft .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#45:1>
The original domestic airport is now international .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#46:1>
There was no concept of promotion at the time , whereas now the
government is actively promoting Danang as a destination . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#47:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m committed to Danang because this is where you can
create something and make things happen .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#48:1>
You can influence the government and make contributions .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#49:1>
And this is a good feeling . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#60:2>
<bold> N </bold> ow for something you can <it> really </it> sink
your teeth into: beef .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#61:2>
And we  ' re not talking about your run-of-the-mill , bland , tough as
nails , hide-like slab which can only be cut with tools branded &ldquo; Black
& Decker . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#62:2>
Rather , we  ' re talking about some of the finest , most exclusive
steaks in the world that are well worth breaking tour piggy bank for . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#63:2>
<bold> In Its Prime </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#64:2>
Whoever said you get what you pay for must have been referring to
beef .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#65:2>
The best of the best in the US is so fantastic in taste and texture
that it  ' s worth every precious penny .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#66:2>
And be warned: It <it> will </it> cost more than a few . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#67:2>
The top grade of beef in the US is United States Department of
Agriculture &obrack;  USDA &cbrack; Prime .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#68:2>
This title is reserved for only the finest two percent of all
American beef . Below this grade are seven others , including Choice , Select
, Standard and more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#69:2>
But , you ask , is it <it> really </it> that good ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#70:2>
Frankly , it is .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#71:2>
One bite is all you  ' ll need to be convinced , although it might
make you turn your nose up at future , less fabulous offers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#72:2>
One key characteristic of Prime beef is an incredible , melt-in-your
mouth tenderness that  ' s not found in other grades of beef .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#73:2>
The tenderness and texture comes from the abundance of evenly
distributed marbling in the meat &obrack;  i.e . the presence of fat , which tastes
good and keeps thing moist &cbrack; due to the cow  ' s strict diet of grain or corn .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#74:2>
It  ' s steaks from grain-fed Midwestern cows that you  ' ll find at
<bold> Morton  ' s of Chicago . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#75:2>
While you can pal around with the general manager , Steve McCrimmon ,
or the friendly bartenders , there  ' s no kidding when it comes to the meat .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#76:2>
Steaks are a serious business here .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#77:2>
And if you haven't already seen or heard , they  ' re oversized , too .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#78:2>
&ldquo; Our biggest seller is the 24 oz porterhouse , because you  ' ve
got two different kinds of meat there; the New York strip and the fillet ,
&rdquo; says McCrimmon .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#79:2>
But if that  ' s too small for your taste , they also have one that  ' s
a walloping 48 oz and takes about half an hour to cook .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#80:2>
But before you tuck in , know that your steak has been aged .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#81:2>
" Aging is very important because the process tenderises the meat and
creates a more mature flavor .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#82:2>
We do it tow-and-a-half to three weeks , and we et-age it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#83:2>
Because it  ' s wrapped in Cryovac &obrack;  a high-grade plastic bag &cbrack; and
vacuum-sealed , it comes out moist and tender .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#84:2>
The flavor is not intense; it  ' s very light and tastes very good in
the mouth , &rdquo; he explains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#85:2>
<bold> Ruth  ' s Chris Steak House </bold> also serves up a mean
USDA Prime steak .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#86:2>
Two of their most popular cuts are the filet &obrack;  eight or 12 oz &cbrack; and
the ribeye &obrack;  12 or 16 oz &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#87:2>
Their beef is aged up to 28 days .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#88:2>
A meal here is all about the sizzle: Their 1800º F broiler cooks your
steak , which is then served on a 500º F super-heated plate .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#89:2>
So you  ' ll actually be able to hear your steak coming , and the plate
ensures it stays hot and juicy through the last bite . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#90:2>
If you prefer steaks on a smaller scale , <bold> Mr . Steak
</bold> is the place for you .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#91:2>
Their US Prime steaks are right or 10 oz and range from a ribeye to a
filet mignon . And , because of their location at The Sanlitun , you can dine
alfresco and people-watch to your heart  ' s content .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#92:2>
There are a couple of US Prime options at the <bold> San Francisco
Steak House , </bold> too , including a 10 oz sirloin and a 14 oz ribeye .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#94:2>
The other legendary beef in the world of meat is Kobe .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#95:2>
And more recently , Wagyu beef has been showing up on menus around
town .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#96:2>
Kobe beef is an exclusive grade of beef that comes from the Wagyu cow .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#97:2>
In order to earn the official crown of " Kobe Beef , &rdquo; the
Wagyu beef must come from Kobe , Japan , and meet with the rigid production
standards imposed in that prefecture .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#98:2>
The rating system is pretty complicated and includes the evaluation
of color , fat color , marbling scores from one to 12 , and meat texture .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#99:2>
The beef is famous for its flavor and tenderness , and again , both
are due to fat . Wagyu cattle actually have a genetic predisposition to
marbling over other breeds , so for the diner , this means a long-lasting
taste experience and full , meaty flavor held in the fat of the steak .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#100:2>
Some say Kobe beef rivals even foie gras for richness and caloric
content . </p> <O> Three photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#104:2>
In Japan , Wagyu cows get the royal treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#105:2>
Massaged with sake and fed beer along with their grains , the cows
produce meat that  ' s extremely and consistently tender , finely marbled , and
delicious .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#106:2>
But land is precious and costly in Japan , so there  ' s a growing
trend of raising Wagyu cows in other countries , like the US and Australia ,
and giving them the same imperial pampering . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#107:2>
<bold> The Steak House </bold> serves aged USDA Prime as well as
Wagyu beef from Australia , and the steaks are done the traditional way -
over a charcoal grill .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#108:2>
For the USDA you can choose something a little smaller , like the
petite filet mignon &obrack;  8 oz &cbrack; , or really go for the gusto and order the
Texas-cut porterhouse &obrack;  24 oz &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#109:2>
If you  ' d rather have the Wagyu , there are three choices on the
menu: two striploins of different grades &obrack;  grade 8 and 10 , both 12 oz &cbrack; and a
tenderloin &obrack;  grade 8 , 8oz &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-016#110:2>
To educate your palate , consider comparing and contrasting
steaks .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#111:2>
If you  ' d rather not share with your dinner companions , <bold> Lan  ' s
</bold> very wisely offers combinations .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#112:2>
Lan  ' s Treasure Sampler includes an 8 oz dry-aged ribeye steak , a 3
oz US Kobe New York strip steak , and a 4 oz US lamb rib chop .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#113:2>
The menu also offers a char-grilled 5 oz US Kobe filet - which is
daintily called the &ldquo; ladies cut &rdquo; and is for smaller appetites -
as well as an enormous 35 oz US Prime slow-roasted , dry-aged rib of beef
that  ' s meant for two &obrack;  but we know people who can polish it off all on their
lonesome &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#114:2>
So go ahead and dig into you bank account .

<ICE-HK:W2D-016#115:2>
The tasty , tender experience is well worth it . </p>
