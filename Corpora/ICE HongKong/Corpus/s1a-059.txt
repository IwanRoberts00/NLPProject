I mean the the bathrooms in in the <{1> <[1> restaurants </[1>
like McDonald and that <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X55:1:Z>
They are usually if if I really need <?> these </?> the bathrooms
in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X56:1:Z>
I will go to McDonald <?> or </?> somewhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X57:1:Z>
Because they  ' re usually a little better <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X58:1:Z>
But uhm <&> tut </&> uh so I went to Xiamen and then uhm <?>
Quanzhou </?> which is <{4> <[4> <,,> </[4> it  ' s just a little farther up
the coast </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#59:1:A>

But nearby is a city called the <?> Chouwu </?> which is uhm <&>
tut </&> a <?> forecast </?> city

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X66:1:Z>
That was built in the Ming Dynasty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X67:1:Z>
That  ' s <{1> <[1> along </[1> the ocean and the walls are still in
taps so it  ' s very <{2> <[2> beautiful </[2> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#68:1:A>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#69:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#70:1:A>

<[> I <,> I don't </[> </{> think I will go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#74:1:A>
Because I always think that those cities are very uhm <,,> poor

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#75:1:A>
Are are they poor or the <{1> <[1> infrastructures </[1> are not
good and and the <,> and <{2> <[2> the transportation uh and the hygiene are
<unc> one-word </unc> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#76:1:A>
Xiamen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X77:1:Z>

Xiamen  ' s <{1> <[1> very </[1> clean

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X81:1:Z>
The other places they  ' re very <unc> one-word </unc> <&>

<$Z> laughs </&> <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X82:1:Z>
They are not ideal <&>

<$Z> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X83:1:Z>
I went to Fuzhou which is a very dismal depressing looking city
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#84:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#85:1:A>

How are the people there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X87:1:Z>
Uh people are friendly

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X88:1:Z>
And and and I think they are they are fairly used to seeing
foreigners so I didn't <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X89:1:Z>
People didn't notice me as much <{> <[> <?> more </?> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#90:1:A>
<[> I but </[> </{> I know that uhm many of the people in the
Xiamen or or Fujian

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#91:1:A>
They <,> they do not speak Mandarin or <{1> <[1> they </[1> they
speak uh Fujian <{2> <[2> <unc> one-word </unc> </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X92:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X93:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah and their </[2> </{2> their Mandarin is very difficult
to understand when they speak <{> <[> it </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#94:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> uh can they understand you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X95:1:Z>
If if if they want money from me they can understand me

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X96:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> That  ' s </[1> usually how things work in the world

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X97:1:Z>
If I if I  ' m trying to buy a ticket or something <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X98:1:Z>
And people can find a way to understand that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X99:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> Uh </[2> I I didn't uh <,> I didn't take any trains and
that  ' s usually what I talk to people the most

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X100:1:Z>
So I I uh <,> uh I I didn't really have long conversation <{3>
<[3> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X101:1:Z>
And </[3> then I went to <?> Wuyishan </?> uh the <.> na </.> a

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X103:1:Z>
And we take a night bus </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#104:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X112:1:Z>
At five thirty at night and we were very angry

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X113:1:Z>
Because that means it arrives at three in the morning <{2> <[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X114:1:Z>
They won't leave later we said it should leave at eight thirty or
nine thirty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X115:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#116:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X125:1:Z>
I guess there is a it  ' s the the the full of

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X126:1:Z>
There are a lot of people fly from Shanghai that that  ' s fairly
close by by plane

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X127:1:Z>
Uh it  ' s hard to get there if you don't fly now I know though
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#128:1:A>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#129:1:A>
Are there many foreigners there like you so

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#130:1:A>
Do they feel <{> <[> surprise to </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X131:1:Z>
<[> Not not not that </[> </{> area that that area they were a
little surprised you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#132:1:A>
And they are also surprise at your fluent Mandarin <{> <[>
<unc> one-word </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X133:1:Z>
<[> No </[> </{> no not fluent but they were surprised that I
could speak to them yeah <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X134:1:Z>
The uhm <&> tut </&> <,> in that area they were very aggressive
to other if the

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X135:1:Z>
The only thing in the city is tourism

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X136:1:Z>
So anywhere you go they are always following you and <unc>
one-word </unc> <{2> <[2> the </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#137:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#138:1:A>
<[2> Is the </[2> </{2> are are the are the things there very
cheap

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X139:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#140:1:A>
Not cheap why

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X141:1:Z>
Well I mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#142:1:A>
Because it is near to Shanghai

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X143:1:Z>
Uh no that <?> is </?> that really near Shanghai <{1> <[1> by
</[1> aeroplane

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X144:1:Z>
It it it  ' s it  ' s a decent there are a lot of flight to Shanghai
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X145:1:Z>
But I mean things like eating are inexpensive

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X146:1:Z>
But <,> like at <?> Wuyishan </?> every scenic spots you to go is
another ticket

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X147:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> That  ' s maybe </[3> thirty Renmenbi here and twenty
there and <,> they keep trying to add it on and

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X148:1:Z>
And they purposely don't have public buses that go to those
places

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X149:1:Z>
So you have to take taxi <{4> <[4> so </[4> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X150:1:Z>
It may be better to go <{5> <[5> with a tour group </[5> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#151:1:A>

that so <,> yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#176:1:A>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#177:1:A>
<[2> I I don't know </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#178:1:A>
But I I think uhm they probably charge more for a foreigner <.> es
</.> uh <{> <[> especially </[> for foreigner

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X179:1:Z>
<[> Oh yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X180:1:Z>
Oh no I  ' m aware of that but there  ' s nothing I can do <{> <[> so
</[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#181:1:A>
<[> Did </[> </{> not uh did you bargain <,> bargain to them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X182:1:Z>
Oh yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#183:1:A>
<[> I </[> </{> think you can actually in any places in China
you can bargain uhm <,> more than fifty percent discount

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X184:1:Z>
Yeah it it it  ' s starting to change <,> uh at at places they

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X185:1:Z>
I guess people get kind of tired of bargaining

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X186:1:Z>
Sometimes like <,> hotels they  ' ll publish a price list

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X187:1:Z>
They will publish a discounting list <{1> <[1> and </[1> they
they don't

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X188:1:Z>
They really unwilling to go below the discount list so they

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X189:1:Z>
You can still sort of bargain but it  ' s it  ' s it  ' s not

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X190:1:Z>
It depends on where you go <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X191:1:Z>
Some places everything you have to bargain

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X192:1:Z>
Some it  ' s <,> it  ' s uh it  ' s more straight now

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X193:1:Z>
Like grocery stores often don't bargain any more <,> you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X194:1:Z>
<.> Aft </.> after that I went into Jiangxi province <,> which
they don't see any foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X195:1:Z>
No one goes there </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#196:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#197:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#198:1:A>
Jiangxi <{> <[> okay </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#199:1:A>
Where is it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X200:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X201:1:Z>
That  ' s uh <{1> <[1> just the west of Fujian

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X202:1:Z>
It  ' s just straight </[1> west

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X203:1:Z>
I went in from the north side down it

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X204:1:Z>
A two hour bus ride that took four hours <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X205:1:Z>
Because <{2> <[2> they </[2> stop any time even they see a cow on
the road

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X206:1:Z>
They ask if it wants to ride <{3> <[3> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X207:1:Z>
And they </[3> they packed the <{4> <[4> people there </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X208:1:Z>
And not the traffic and there  ' s a lot of construction <{5> <[5>
<,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X209:1:Z>
And it was a widening road on the mounts

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X210:1:Z>
Three people threw up on the ride

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X211:1:Z>
They were uhm <?> drawing </?> up outside the window <{6> <[6>
and road side </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X212:1:Z>
That was <.> terri </.> <&>

<$Z> laughs </&> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X213:1:Z>
And eventually I got to uh Jingdezhen <{7> <[7> which </[7> is
the uhm <&> tut </&> the main pottery center in China <{8> <[8> <unc>
one-word </unc> </[8> </X>

in the uhm <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X224:1:Z>
It it first become uh uh <,> a big pottery center in the Southern
Song Dynasty <{4> <[4> <,> about </[4> eleven eleven hundreds

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X225:1:Z>
And to this day the main pottery center in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X226:1:Z>
<{5> <[5> And </[5> that was interesting but there  ' re

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X227:1:Z>
Just the stores have a lot of junk

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X228:1:Z>
<{6> <[6> There </[6> are few stores that have very nice stuff
and the rest was just junk </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#229:1:A>

It it  ' s just the collection of independent stores <,> that are
<,> uhm of varying quality

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X246:1:A>

Was it was it a special experience

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X328:1:Z>
Was it worth the money </X>

<$A> Uh yes I I I think it worth

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#329:1:A>
I I went to the book city in China to buy some books <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#330:1:A>

<[5> Uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X337:1:Z>
Yes uh I I found that <,> any any trains going to Shenzhen <{1>
<[1> or </[1> any buses

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X338:1:Z>
They add a lot of money to go from Guangzhou to Shenzhen

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X339:1:Z>
Like uh when I was taking a train from uh Hengyang in Wunan <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> to go out to take a sleeper to Guangzhou

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X340:1:Z>
I I think it  ' s about one hundred fifty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X341:1:Z>
But to take continue on two more hours to Shenzhen was like two
hundred ninety

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X342:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> They </[3> added a lot just to <,> have those extra
hours

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X343:1:Z>
So I didn't do that <,> yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#344:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#347:1:A>
So uh did you did you buy any books because <{> <[> it  ' s </[> it  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#348:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X349:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X350:1:Z>
I bought some here

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X351:1:Z>
In in China I I bought a few

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X352:1:Z>
This time I didn't buy any <,> but <{> <[> uh you </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#353:1:A>
<[> Where </[> </{> did you go to buy books in in very <,> in
in <.> si </.> shopping malls like the book city or

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X354:1:Z>
Yeah like uhm <&> tut </&> a lot of cities like Shanghai uh have
a a foreign languages book store </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#355:1:A>
Yes foreign <{1> <[1> and Guangzhou </[1> also have

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#356:1:A>
And <{2> <[2> Shenzhen </[2> too

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X357:1:Z>
<[1> And yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X358:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X359:1:Z>
Yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X360:1:Z>
Sold that kind of stuff

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X361:1:Z>
And <.> usu </.> usually I  ' ll just <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X362:1:Z>
Usually they either have very old classics in English or they
have Chinese translations that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X363:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> If </[1> they are imported books then that you don't
really safe any money <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X364:1:Z>
You know if it if it is just like a best seller in America that
they imported that will be expensive <{2> <[2> but </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#365:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#366:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#367:1:A>
Actually I I I I want to know that uh the books are <,> pirated
copies or <unc> two-words </unc> <{> <[> or </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X368:1:Z>
<[> Oh </[> </{> no that different <{1> <[1> there will be there
will </[1> be another <{2> <[2> story </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#369:1:A>
<[1> I I don't know that </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#370:1:A>
<[2> No uh </[2> </{2> the cover said that it is official <,> copy
version

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X371:1:Z>
So do the VCD when you buy them uh <&> All speakers laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X372:1:Z>
If they copy the whole book why not copy the thing that says it  ' s
official right

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X373:1:Z>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X374:1:Z>
But uh in China everybody justifies that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X375:1:Z>
They say that they  ' re developing

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X376:1:Z>
<{> <[> They </[> should be able to copy things and <,> not not
pay for copyright and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#377:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#378:1:A>
Actually in Hong Kong the case is also the <{> <[> same </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X379:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X380:1:Z>
I think <{> <[> it  ' s changed you know </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#381:1:A>
<[> I think in every places </[> </{> <,> in every place
people like to buy cheap things

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X382:1:Z>
Uhm yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X383:1:Z>
Uh when when I was studying in Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X384:1:Z>
One of the professors talked about how <,> Japanese used to feel
that way

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X385:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> But </[1> then Japanese companies started making lots
of software and video games and <{2> <[2> now they hate it </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X386:1:Z>
Yes because they they lose all those money in China now

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X387:1:Z>
Before they had nothing to lose so they loved it but

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X388:1:Z>
So people think maybe China will change eventually when </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#389:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#390:1:A>
<[2> They start to hate it </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#391:1:A>
No I I don't think <{1> <[1> so </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#392:1:A>
I think uh the people who <{2> <[2> <,> hate it are </[2> only the
businessmen <{3> <[3> who </[3> make the software but not the uh end user

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X393:1:Z>
<[1> Never </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X394:1:Z>
<[2> Hundred of years </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X395:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X396:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#397:1:A>
And

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X398:1:Z>
But if the businessmen give the policemen to enforce the laws

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X399:1:Z>
Then there  ' re actually might might be some change </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#400:1:A>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X401:1:Z>

<{> <[> So what will </[> you do if you if you if your job <,>

<[2> I </[2> </{2> the uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X428:1:Z>
I don't know how well I will be able to handle the pollution

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X429:1:Z>
<.> Bei </.> Beijing is very nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X430:1:Z>
It  ' s uh <,> it  ' s you have to like politics to be there

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X431:1:Z>
Cause it <,> <.> ev </.> everywhere you go there  ' s something you
know some government building

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X432:1:Z>
And it it you know like being in maybe Washington D.C. in the US
where you  ' re just <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X433:1:Z>
You sort of surrounded by the world of politics

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X434:1:Z>
<{> <[> And </[> and that uhm I don't like quite as much

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X435:1:Z>
But uh not Beijing is nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X436:1:Z>
Some of it <,> very Chinese and you know kind of preserved from
the Qing dynasty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X437:1:Z>
Other parts are ugly Russian buildings that they <?> build </?>
in the nineteen fifties and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X438:1:Z>
Those things should be destroyed <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X439:1:Z>
In the north I like Dalian <?> and </?> the best </X>

<$A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X451:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X452:1:Z>
Dalian <?> and there  ' s </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X453:1:Z>
There there  ' s a lot of business from Korea

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X454:1:Z>
They go across the water <{> <[> <,> </[> near Korea

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X455:1:Z>

<[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </{>

So uhm will you also go to the northwest part of the of China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X458:1:Z>
<[> Some day I would </[> </{> like to </X>

<[> That  ' s not even </[> </{> that  ' s not developing

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X462:1:Z>
I would I would like to see that some day

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X463:1:Z>
But it takes a lot of time to go to those places </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#464:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X465:1:Z>
You can't just <,> go for a week and back

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X466:1:Z>
I go to <,> uh Guangxi uh you know that <{> <[> would </[> take
<,> a lot of free time and <,> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X467:1:Z>
Some day I would like to <,> yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#468:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#469:1:A>
Uhm after you back to US and then you come to China again

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X470:1:Z>
Uhm may maybe maybe I can <,> get myself a graduation present
next year and

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X471:1:Z>
And spend them up in China going <,> to <{1> <[1> places </[1>
like that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X472:1:Z>
That will be more difficult to communicate

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X473:1:Z>
Cause a lot really don't speak any kind of Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X474:1:Z>
A lot of uh <{2> <[2> central </[2> Asian languages </X>

<$A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X482:1:Z>
A lot of them are more Russian than Chinese so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#483:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X488:1:Z>
There  ' s a lot of there  ' s a lot of uhm Muslims and <,> <&> tut

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X489:1:Z>
They  ' re not really Russians <{1> <[1> but </[1> that group

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X490:1:Z>
But a lot of those are at the northwest of China <{2> <[2> too
</[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#491:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#492:1:A>
<[2> Wow </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#493:1:A>
Too complicated <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#494:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X496:1:Z>
<[2> Oh that  ' s that  ' s why </[2> </{2> like like Xinjiang is a

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#497:1:A>
<[1> Xin </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#498:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#499:1:A>
Xinjiang is also uh is also in the west uh northwest

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X500:1:Z>
Uhm the far northwest </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#501:1:A>
Oh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X502:1:Z>
North of Tibet </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#503:1:A>
Is it very cold and also very <,> hot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X504:1:Z>
From what I hear yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X505:1:Z>
There  ' s lots of desert and it  ' s <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#506:1:A>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#507:1:A>
Terrible

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X508:1:Z>
Yeah it  ' s <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X509:1:Z>
There is a reason

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X510:1:Z>
It it it  ' s near the end of earth basically it  ' s uh it  ' s </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#511:1:A>
I but I think the <,> the <,> the pollution problem there is
<,> is not serious right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X512:1:Z>
It shouldn't be

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X513:1:Z>
There  ' s nothing there <{1> <[1> I think </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X514:1:Z>
And uhm I think in the Gansu province the the capital there
Lanzhou is the most polluted city in China <,> <{2> <[2> than </[2> otherwise

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X515:1:Z>
Yeah they in the China Daily they publish weekly pollution the
weekly pollution index <{3> <[3> <,> where </[3> they have a ranking of what  ' s
most polluted

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X516:1:Z>
I don't know how the scale works

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X517:1:Z>
But <,> let  ' s say in the winter time like Beijing Shang

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X518:1:Z>
Beijing may be a hundred and fifty and I  ' m not sure what that
really means

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X519:1:Z>
But then <{4> <[4> Shanghai </[4> like one twenty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X520:1:Z>
<{5> <[5> Other </[5> cities are eighty ninety one hundred

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X521:1:Z>
But this Lanzhou <{6> <[6> is usually three fifty </[6> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#522:1:A>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#523:1:A>
<[2> Wow </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#524:1:A>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#525:1:A>
<[4> Oh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#526:1:A>
<[5> Uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#527:1:A>
<[6> I think that that  ' s </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#528:1:A>
I think that  ' s <{> <[> <,> </[> the average

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#529:1:A>
I think that scale is similar to Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X530:1:Z>
<[> Wow </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X531:1:Z>
Is it

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X532:1:Z>
Yeah I I don't <{> <[> understand how works but </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#533:1:A>
<[> But I I think the

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#534:1:A>
I </[> </{> <.> re </.> I remember that the most serious <,,>
polluted day in Hong Kong <.> rec </.> records are scale of uh <,> two
hundred <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#535:1:A>
Two hundred in Causeway Bay or <{2> <[2> Hong Kong </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X536:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X537:1:Z>
<[2> Uh okay yeah </[2> </{2> so this Lanzhou is about three
fifty

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X538:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Because </[1> it it  ' s a city right in between
mountains <{2> <[2> uh </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X539:1:Z>
And there  ' s lots of factories so that pollution doesn't get out

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X540:1:Z>
Once you get out of the city <,> it  ' s okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X541:1:Z>
But in the city it  ' s just like a a trap from the </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#542:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#543:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#544:1:A>
So I think the people there maybe

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#545:1:A>
When they go out they all wear the mask

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X546:1:Z>
Wear masks

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X547:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#548:1:A>
<[> Put </[> </{> on their mask

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X549:1:Z>
I I I read an article recently of a <{1> <[1> man </[1> who uhm
<&> tut </&> I forget his name

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X550:1:Z>
He made he made millions <,> in uh in other parts of China in in
some kind of business

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X551:1:Z>
And he returned to his hometown in Lanzhou <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X552:1:Z>
And he  ' s doing some project where <,> there are

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X553:1:Z>
He  ' s trying to destroy the mountains <,> around the city

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X554:1:Z>
And it  ' s <,> it  ' s something where they run water continuously
down the mountain to soften the the earth

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X555:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> And </[3> then they can move it away

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X556:1:Z>
So they are trying to knock part of the mountain down

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X557:1:Z>
So more air can come in and circulate </X>

That means not that you don't want to just as you aren't

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X660:2:Z>
I don't think you have any say of whether you want to be or not
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X661:2:Z>
You in the <unc> one-word </unc> or you  ' re not

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X662:2:Z>
You know I mean it  ' s not the <{1> <[1> matter </[1> one thing to
be something

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X663:2:Z>
It likes saying I want to be a girl though I  ' m not

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X664:2:Z>
I  ' m well <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X665:2:Z>
It likes to say I want to <{2> <[2> be a boy </[2> or already I  ' m
a <{3> <[3> boy </[3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#666:2:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#668:2:A>
<[3> But </[3> </{3> whether you want to be a lesbian or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#669:2:A>

<[> But </[> </{> for you all the all uh whether you want to

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X673:2:Z>
<[> But I </[> </{> can't choose it </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#674:2:A>
Why

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X675:2:Z>
Because it  ' s something that in the nature to your or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X676:2:Z>
I don't think you have a choice in it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#677:2:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X678:2:Z>
Do you think that she <,> she consciously chooses to be attracted
to the same sex

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X679:2:Z>
You think she chose that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X680:2:Z>
Do you think that one day she decided <,> I want to be attracted
to the same sex

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X681:2:Z>
So that  ' s what <{> <[> I <unc> one-word </unc> mean </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#682:2:A>
<[> But I </[> </{> think maybe the life experience have some
influence to them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X683:2:Z>
You don't think that is <,> uh people are born that way </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#684:2:A>
I don't think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X685:2:Z>
Why not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#686:2:A>
Uhm I think they they must have some experience to influence
their <.> pref </.> preference I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X687:2:Z>
Uh why

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X688:2:Z>
What <.> ex </.> what <.> ex </.> what experience did you have
that influence you to like boys

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X689:2:Z>
What make you like boys </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#690:2:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#691:2:A>
Maybe education I can <{> <[> I can say </[> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X692:2:Z>
<[> Education </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X693:2:Z>
Right so <{1> <[1> somebody say you you </[1> must like boys

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X694:2:Z>
So you say oh okay <{2> <[2> I  ' m I like okay </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#695:2:A>
<[1> When you  ' re when when you  ' re <.> si </.> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#696:2:A>
<[2> No not you must not </[2> </{2> you must

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#697:2:A>
Because uhm people educate you to be uh this is normal <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> people had uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#698:2:A>
Girls normally have to get along with guys

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#699:2:A>
Then <,> in your mind you will think that well it  ' s normal we
have to accept that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#700:2:A>
But for if but if <,> a girl get along with uhm <,> another girl
they are I <?> means </?> lesbian

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#701:2:A>
People may <,> perceive them as uhm rather abnormal or strange

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#702:2:A>
I think <{2> <[2> education has </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X703:2:Z>
<[1> Uh ha </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X704:2:Z>
<[2> So why </[2> </{2> would you choose to be that

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X705:2:Z>
If you why would you choose to be abnormal and strange </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#706:2:A>
I think uh it  ' s <,> everybody experience is different

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#707:2:A>
Maybe their experience had some in has great influence to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#708:2:A>
Maybe uhm some of them don't have a good don't had a good time
with a guy and they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#709:2:A>
I I don't know how to explain it

What do what <,> what do you think about the Hong Kong uh movie
stars

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X800:2:Z>
Uh <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X801:2:Z>
Uh some of them are okay sometimes <unc> two-words </unc>
maybe come out

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X802:2:Z>
Maybe now and again but mostly it just formulaic

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X803:2:Z>
It  ' s formularized <{> <[> <,> </[> just that they make money

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X804:2:Z>
And the stories are the <,> that  ' s

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X805:2:Z>
There are any stories for over <,> or they  ' re repetitive

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X806:2:Z>
But some of them are okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X807:2:Z>
I think <,> uh <indig> jau sing chih </indig> <&> These Cantonese
words are the Chinese name of a Hong Kong movie star </&> is quite funny
sometimes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#808:2:A>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#809:2:A>

Some not of them either some of <{> <[> them yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#811:2:A>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{> <&>

<$B> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#812:2:B>
But most Hong Kong people criticize that Hong uh <indig> jau sing
chih  ' s </indig> <&> These Cantonese words are the Chinese name of a Hong
Kong movie star </&> film is uh rather rubbish

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#813:2:B>
<{1> <[1> Though </[1> it  ' s funny but it  ' s <{2> <[2> it  ' s
meaningless </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X814:2:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X815:2:B>
<[2> Yes it  ' s </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X816:2:B>
Meaningless

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X817:2:Z>
Of course it  ' s meaningless but it  ' s entertainment

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X818:2:Z>
It  ' s not for <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X819:2:Z>
It doesn't it doesn't <,> proposed to be anything serious

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X820:2:Z>
<{> <[> And I </[> think any Hong Kong film does that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#821:2:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#822:2:B>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X823:2:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#824:2:A>
No uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X825:2:Z>
Sometimes I find I don't mind watching Hong Kong movies <{1> <[1>
<,> then </[1> maybe laugh

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X826:2:Z>
But I I think they quite ridiculous

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X827:2:Z>
But I think it  ' s supposed <{2> <[2> to be </[2> ridiculous
anyway </X>

direction and the <.> filmo </.> and the filmography is better <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X834:2:Z>
Uhm <,,> but <,> I don't know how to say really

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#X835:2:Z>

<[2> It  ' s </[2> </{2> very cute

I know

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#865:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#866:2:A>
But uh other than this

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#867:2:A>
Uh have you <?> watch </?> any uhm <,> category three movies
recently

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#868:2:B>
Uh let me think about it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#869:2:B>
Recently

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#870:2:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#871:2:B>
Uhm <,> <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#872:2:B>
Yes uhm but I don't know the English name

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#873:2:A>
I see

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#874:2:A>
<{1> <[1> I think </[1> uh there are so many horror movies
recently <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#875:2:A>
And uh I think uh they  ' re they  ' re not very scary actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#876:2:A>
Because uh <,> the story or the techniques <?> use </?> are using
is uh more or less the same

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#877:2:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#878:2:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#879:2:B>
You mean Scream Three

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#880:2:A>
Uh <,> no I mean uh those are Japanese or or uh <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> Hong Kong horror <{2> <[2> Ring </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#881:2:A>
Yeah yeah yeah Ring

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#882:2:A>
I think uh the techniques they are using are almost the same <{3>
<[3> <,,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#883:2:A>
I think it  ' s it  ' s not scary any longer because uh <,> the
magazines and the newspaper <.> al </.> always uh <,> tell the <.> stor </.>
tell uh <,> <{4> <[4> the whole </[4> story <{5> <[5> before </[5> we watch
it

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#884:2:A>
So uh we don't have any uhm surprise when we  ' ll we  ' re looking at
it

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-059#885:2:B>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#886:2:B>
<[2> Movies </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#887:2:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#888:2:B>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#889:2:B>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#890:2:B>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#891:2:B>
So uh I have same <&> tut </&> uh feelings too

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#892:2:B>
Because uh before the <,> uh magazines <,> uh uh tell the people
about the story of Ring <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#893:2:B>
Uh I have gone to the <,> uhm uh theatre and <.> si </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#894:2:B>
I  ' m watch the film

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#895:2:B>
I think it  ' s <,> very good <&>

<$A> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-059#896:2:A>
It  ' s very scary </I>
