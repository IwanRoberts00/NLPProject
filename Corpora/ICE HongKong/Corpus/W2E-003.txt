<bold> End this selfishness </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#2:1>
If a public consultation into proposals to block mobile phone
signals at performance venues reveals widespread support - as it surely ought
to do - we could become the first place in the world where such blocking
devices are legalised . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#3:1>
The result , no doubt , will mean both good and bad publicity .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#4:1>
The good will come from the fact that , at last , the insufferable
problem of selfish and ignorant people who are prepared to allow the
disruption of others ' enjoyment of a movie or performance simply because they
cannot bear to miss out on what is often an inane and unimportant
conversation , will have been solved .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#5:1>
The bad publicity will emerge when it is realised that a large number
of people in Hong Kong are incapable of acting in a civilised manner by
simply obeying requests to turn off their phones .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#6:1>
That these requests signally fail to make an impact has now become
obvious , and such a state of affairs is profoundly sad . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#7:1>
It is clear that when &obrack;  as we report today &cbrack; , a famous actress
makes a heartfelt appeal to an audience of a Shakespeare play to turn off
their phones , and when a tennis star cannot make a serve because of the
distractions from constant ringing , it is time to act . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#8:1>
It now appears technical difficulties can be overcome - blocking
can , if carefully controlled , be confined to precise areas; medical pagers
can be operated on frequencies unaffected by blocking devices .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#9:1>
There is therefore no longer any reason to delay . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#10:1>
Certainly , the <it> South China Morning Post </it>  ' s letters
page will explode in celebration if a ban is introduced . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#11:1>
In truth , although the problem is especially bad here , it is
also growing in other parts of the world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#12:1>
And it should be remembered that only a tiny minority of people here
deliberately leave phones switched on in places of entertainment .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#13:1>
Unfortunately , this minority can leave an impression that Hong Kong
audiences are full of philistines .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#14:1>
This is untrue and it is about time these selfish , stubborn people
were prevented once and for all from besmirching Hong Kong  ' s reputation.

<h> <bold> Trouble on the cards </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#16:2>
For the second time in a week , the problem of people in Hong
Kong getting into trouble with their credit card bills has been thrown into
the spotlight . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#17:2>
On Tuesday , the Government revealed a huge rise in personal
bankruptcies for the first three months of this year compared with the year
before .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#18:2>
The administration blamed two linked reasons: the rise in the number
of unemployed , and excessive borrowing by individuals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#19:2>
The problem , it was claimed , meant that the banking sector was
losing &dollar;13 million every day due to credit card debt being written off
once borrowers go bankrupt . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#20:2>
Then investment bank Morgan Stanley claimed Hong Kong had one of
the highest rates of credit card defaults in the developed world .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#21:2>
The bank said in a report this week that Hong Kong  ' s charge-off rate
now looked set to hit 10 per cent in the first quarter of this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#22:2>
It is easy to see how this is happening .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#23:2>
The economic downturn is throwing more people out of work , and
frequently meaning a cut in the wages of those left in a job .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#24:2>
Faced with a declining income it is not hard to see why people choose
bankruptcy as a way out of their problems , leaving their credit card debt
unpaid . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#25:2>
The banks themselves say part of the problem is the ease with
which bankrupts can get discharged . They blame the increase on the
relaxation of rules that allow bankrupt individuals to resume borrowing after
just four years instead of eight years previously . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#26:2>
However , banks also have to take their own share of the blame .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#27:2>
Faced with lower margins between their traditional borrowing and
lending lines , they have sought new areas of business .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#28:2>
The rising debts are seen as a side effect of banks scrambling to
offset weak mortgage demand by aggressively pushing high-yield credit cards
and consumer loans . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#29:2>
To their credit , some of the banks admit this has caused them
problems .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#30:2>
One way to address the problem they say is to allow them to share
more information about their clients , such as the number of cards they have
or their level of credit .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#31:2>
However , the proposals have attracted criticism that they involve an
invasion of personal privacy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#32:2>
The banks could help their case by taking steps of their own .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#33:2>
They could stop , for example , the dangerous habit of sending out
pre-approved credit-card applications where one signature is all it takes to
secure a credit line . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#34:2>
Both consumers and banks need to take their share of the
responsibility if the bankruptcy problem is to be addressed . </p>

<h> <bold> Time for tough talk </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#36:3>
Following their meeting yesterday , US Secretary of State Colin
Powell and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon were careful not to display
any of the discord and frustration they must now be feeling towards one
another .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#37:3>
Certainly , behind the smiles and the expressions of sympathy for
Israel  ' s suffering at the hands of Palestinian terrorists , Mr Powell and
his team of negotiators must now be furious at Israel  ' s intransigence
towards US demands for an immediate troop withdrawal from the West Bank .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#38:3>
Cordiality between the two countries - the US being Israel  ' s
closest ally - as well as pragmatism will no doubt mean the deep frustrations
can , for the time being , be kept away from public gaze .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#39:3>
And yet , Israel will find itself playing an extremely risky hand if
it continues to defy the clear cut demands of a US President , demands that
are now , no doubt , being relayed by President Bush  ' s most senior member of
government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#40:3>
Israel has a much-deserved reputation for refusing to take orders
or be intimidated by any other nation - when attacked it hits back hard and
keeps on hitting until the threat is gone .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#41:3>
In the past it was surrounded by nations dedicated to its destruction .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#42:3>
It could afford no other strategy . But today  ' s struggle is
different .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#43:3>
The enemy is not a clearly defined body of troops; instead it is a
spirit .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#44:3>
For the most part this spirit is one of hatred , and one that
inspires people to blow themselves up in a cause that - however misguided
they may be - they believe in .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#45:3>
This spirit will only feed on Israeli military campaigns . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#46:3>
Israel is entitled to hit back against terrorism .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#47:3>
But , as Mr Powell pointed out following his meeting with Mr Sharon ,
the challenge now is how to get beyond the response .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#48:3>
Sooner or later , Israel will have to respond to US pressure and
withdraw its troops .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#49:3>
Mr Powell has provided the mandatory smiles and reassurances of
sympathy; he must now talk tough and make it clear that ignoring the demands
of the US President , and the whole international community , is no longer an
option . </p>

<h> <bold> Attractive proposal </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#51:4>
Property developers have reported brisk sales at several new
developments at the West Kowloon reclamation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#52:4>
That should have been really good news , had it not been achieved by
pricing the units cheaper than comparable developments launched only a short
while ago . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#53:4>
Almost five years after the property market peaked , there are as
yet no signs that prices have bottomed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#54:4>
That is bad news for all homeowners , particularly an estimated
73,000 who had bought before 1997 and whose flats are now worth less than
their mortgages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#55:4>
If prices continue to plunge , as warned by the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority , another 12,000 households could be similarly affected
when the year ends . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#56:4>
It is against such a background that the Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation is being asked to give its blessing to a proposal that would
allow homeowners in negative equity to borrow up to 140 per cent of the value
of their property . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#57:4>
The proposal will not completely help homeowners shake free of
their deflated assets .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#58:4>
As a means of lessening their burden , however , it looks attractive .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#59:4>
On the basis that prices have fallen about 50 per cent since 1997
, allowing homes to be re-financed at up to 140 per cent of their present
value would amount to issuing a loan equivalent to the book value of the
original mortgage .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#60:4>
That would enable homeowners to benefit from the low interest rates
at which new mortgages are being granted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#61:4>
The key to the success of the proposal is that the HKMC could be
convinced of the viability of covering the risk of default by charging a
premium at about four to five per cent of the value of the new loan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#62:4>
It is important that the scheme  ' s feasibility be given
expeditious consideration , as its success hinges on seizing the advantages
presented by interest rates which are currently extremely low . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#63:4>
Some economists have warned that the Federal Reserve may have to
raise interest rates to prevent the recovering American economy from
rebounding too quickly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#64:4>
Should that happen , a golden opportunity to help our unfortunate
homeowners would be lost . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#65:5>
<h> <bold> Extend this scheme </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#66:5>
By any standard , a response rate of 5.6 per cent for any scheme
is low and a 1.2 per cent take-up rate dismal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#67:5>
In their eagerness to promote the rental subsidy scheme for the
elderly , however , officials say those figures show the new initiative is
&ldquo; widely accepted by the community and well-received by the elderly
recipients" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#68:5>
Of the 7,722 potential applicants , they even interviewed the 89
who accepted rental vouchers and presented the findings as evidence of the
scheme  ' s &ldquo; positive &rdquo; reception . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#69:5>
Yet , although officials might have been overzealous in promoting
the scheme , that was no reason to dismiss its merits .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#70:5>
Until now , a major weakness of Hong Kong  ' s public housing programme
has been a lack of choice .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#71:5>
Low-income families on the waiting list get no help at all until they
are allocated a flat built by the Housing Authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#72:5>
The lack of a rental option would have been acceptable had the
waiting time been short . But that was not the case .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#73:5>
The waiting period had been as long as seven to 10 years , although
it has been reduced to about three years in recent times . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#74:5>
The beauty of a rental subsidy scheme is that it is flexible and
costs less than building public housing estates .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#75:5>
For the eligible beneficiaries , it should mean faster relief from
their plight . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#76:5>
With a rental voucher , they can immediately afford to move into
better accommodation located where they want .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#77:5>
For some , the rental option will be preferable to moving into a
public housing estate far away from their workplace or their children  ' s
school .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#78:5>
The scheme should be extended to cover all households as soon as
possible . </p>

<h> <bold> Case for an amnesty </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#80:6>
Nineteen-year-old Lin Yeung-ming has been told she can stay here
, just two days before she was to be repatriated to the mainland and
separated from her twin sister and parents for a second time .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#81:6>
It is the first encouraging sign of the Director of Immigration
exercising compassion in handling right-of-abode seekers whose applications
to stay have been rejected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#82:6>
But the round-about way in which Yeung-ming is being allowed to
exercise her right to stay has suggested that the director remains
circumspect in exercising his discretion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#83:6>
Yeung-ming is among the 4,000-odd right-of-abode seekers whose
claims were rejected by the Court of Final Appeal in January .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#84:6>
The top court accepted that statements made by senior officials in
1997 had created a legitimate expectation in their minds that they could
benefit from the first abode ruling handed down in 1999 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#85:6>
But in view of their large number , the court stopped short of
allowing them to stay; instead , it asked the Director of Immigration to
assess each case and exercise discretion to allow those who warrant
compassionate treatment to stay .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#86:6>
Yet , compassion has been demonstrably absent on the part of the
director , who has allowed no one to stay , until now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#87:6>
Even now , Yeung-ming is being allowed to stay officially at the
behest of the mainland authorities , not the Director of Immigration .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#88:6>
Mainland officials have apparently been persuaded that Yeung-ming is
a special case and will issue her a one-way permit to settle in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#89:6>
She will now have to go back to her home town to collect the
document . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#90:6>
What immigration officials have done for Yeung-ming is similar
to what they achieved for a number of adopted mainland children whose cases
to stay here were also rejected but were issued permits by mainland
authorities after sustained public pressure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#91:6>
For Yeung-ming and those adopted children concerned , it is the
outcome that matters .

<ICE-HK:W2E-003#92:6>
But the indirect way in which their wishes have been granted is a
reminder that the Immigration Department is still sticking to the strict
policy laid down by the SAR Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#93:6>
As long as the Government continues to treat abode seekers as a
burden to Hong Kong who should be barred from crossing the border , few can
expect to be reunited with their separated families here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-003#94:6>
The efforts of immigration officials who have worked hard behind
the scenes to allow Yeung-ming to stay should be recognised , but the case
for a one-off amnesty for all abode seekers who had approached the courts for
the right to stay remains strong . </p>
