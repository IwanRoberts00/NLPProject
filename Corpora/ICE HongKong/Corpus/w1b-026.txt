Since three students have been re-assigned to do the B

assessment survey . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#182:12>
In the meantime , we are still studying the relevancy of the
items in the questionnaire .

<ICE-HK:W1B-026#183:12>
Since much translation workload will be generated during the
analysis stage , we suggest objective type of questions be used as far as
possible .

I will send our feedback on the contents and structure of the
questionnaire to you as soon as possible . </p>

<p>

Re : Diploma in Adult Education

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#214:14>
Further to our meeting this summer , we still need more time to
see how we can market this course in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-026#215:14>
In the mean time , can our &ldquo; Introductory Course to Adult
Education &rdquo; be granted exemption from Vancouver Community College .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#216:14>
If exemption is granted , it will definitely encourage some of
our staff to pursue the Diploma Programme in Adult Education or even the
Bachelor of Education Degree Program . </p>

Dear Mr Greenwood

Re : Application Procedures to University of Bolton

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#234:15>
We have received many enquiries from the students of Caritas
Francis Hsu College on the application procedures of your university . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#235:15>
Since the students have to make preparation for their overseas
studies , we would like to pass the necessary information to them as soon as
possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-026#236:15>
Please advise us on the application procedures of your university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-026#237:15>
It will be a great favour to the students if promotion materials
and prospectus can be available to them as well . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-026#238:15>
As the students are very eager to learn about such information
, which is extremely useful to them when they plan for their studies , I
would appreciate it if you could respond by mid-January . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-026#239:15>
Thank you .
