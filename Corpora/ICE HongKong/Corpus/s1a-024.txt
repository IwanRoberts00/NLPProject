<ICE-HK:S1A-024#384:1:B>
<[> No no no </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#385:1:B>
No no no <{> <[> I </[> I  ' m <.> join </.> joining a trip

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#386:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#387:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#388:1:B>
Well actually I think it  ' s still worth the price uh though
there are actually three days

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#389:1:B>
Uhm because I only paid about three thousand Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#390:1:B>
And then according to the the schedule I should be going up to
this Alishan

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#391:1:A>
<{> <[> That  ' s a nice place </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#392:1:B>
<[> The the </[> </{> the <.> h </.> mountain

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#393:1:B>
The <{> <[> famous mountain in Taiwan </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#394:1:A>
<[> The highest mountain </[> </{> in Taiwan

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#X395:1:Z>
Taiwan </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#396:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#397:1:B>
So I think it  ' s still worth the price

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#398:1:B>
If I have to go there arrange the whole thing on my uh on my own
then I have to pay a accommodation the flight and then I still have to make
arrangement for the transport <{> <[> <,> </[> and that will be very
troublesome

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#399:1:B>
So I think it  ' s still worth three thousand even <{> <[> though
</[> I only have three days holiday

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#X400:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#X401:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-024#403:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-024#404:1:B>
I want to but it was too late that I discover that uhm my
