A STRATEGY FOR HONG KONG INDUSTRIES , INC. </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#2:1>
By S. C. Fung </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#3:1>
The Problem </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#4:1>
Should the Hong Kong Government formulate an industrial strategy ?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#5:1>
It might sound outlandish to pose such a question , especially
when the Government has pointed out time and again that the policy decision
to intervene as little as possible has been a sound one , and that the
industrial sector has been doing just fine .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#6:1>
Furthermore , some actions indicate that the Government already has an
industrial strategy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#7:1>
In a bid to enhance the international competitiveness of Hong Kong
industries and boost R&D and human resource development &obrack; HRD &cbrack;
, the Government has established a multi-million dollar industrial technology
centre and a new university .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#8:1>
Plans for an Industrial Development Council &obrack; IDC &cbrack; to
further what is being done by the Industry Development Board &obrack; IDB
&cbrack; are already at an advanced stage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#9:1>
The Government is also considering setting up a science park and a
third industrial estate for hi-tech development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#10:1>
The establishment of this new infrastructure , however , must be
accompanied , if not preceded by , a specific strategy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#11:1>
Calls still abound for better coordination of , and more long-term
planning for , Hong Kong  ' s industrial development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#12:1>
Dr. T. Y. Fok of the Productivity Council has contended , for
example , that both the industrial technology centre and the University of
Science and Technology lack the resources needed to turn their graduates into
applied technologists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#13:1>
Dr. Charles Kao , Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University , on
the other hand , has defended the relevance of basic research by saying that
adopting a follower  ' s strategy to catch up with technological advancement
will never put Hong Kong in a better competitive position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#14:1>
Some , if not most , academics would agree that Hong Kong  ' s
spending an estimated .05 percent of its GDP on R&D , as compared to
Singapore  ' s .90 percent &obrack; GNP &cbrack; , Taiwan  ' s 1.90 percent
&obrack; GNP &cbrack; and South Korea  ' s 2.60 percent &obrack; GNP &cbrack; ,
is not doing much for Hong Kong  ' s economy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#15:1>
The current research budget for all seven UPGC institutions amounts
to HK&dollar;100 million , as compared to an annual R&D Budget of
HK&dollar;3900 for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United
States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#16:1>
Without help from the Government , the institutions of higher
learning here are not going to get the kind of money they need to conduct
decent research works . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#17:1>
Other problems which need to be addressed with a proactive
industrial strategy include productivity , industrial restructuring ,
internationalisation , the &lsquo; symbiotic &rdquo; relationship with the
Pearl River Delta area , and above all Hong Kong  ' s international
competitiveness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#18:1>
These problems are interrelated , and finding their solutions
should be a strategic priority for the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#19:1>
This will require a mass mobilisation of resources .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#20:1>
It will require foresight and administrative leadership .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#21:1>
It will also demand a willingness on the part of business leaders to
put long-term interests at the forefront of their agenda and follow a
Government lead .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#22:1>
These are urgent matters if Hong Kong wants to remain competitive
through the next century . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#23:1>
Assumptions </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#24:1>
To date , the Government has based their industrial planning on
four assumptions , namely : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; Hong Kong  ' s prosperity
depends on its ability to export; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; the manufacturing
sector will continue to be both a major employer and an important contributor
to Hong Kong  ' s exports; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; Hong Kong will continue to face
competition in its major export markets from other Asian competitors; and
&obrack; 4 &cbrack; the pattern and level of demand for the output of Hong
Kong  ' s manufacturing industries is constantly changing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#25:1>
&obrack; Source : Hong Kong Government Industry Department Report ,
1989-90 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#26:1>
The Government rightly stresses the importance of flexibility in
the manufacturing sector and competitiveness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#27:1>
However , such assumptions must be continually refined to suit Hong
Kong  ' s changing competitive environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#28:1>
Firstly , the more traditional role of Hong Kong as an entrepot
has re-emerged in recent years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#29:1>
Although the growth rates of both re-exports and domestic exports
have declined from 1988 to 1990 &obrack; from 50.7 to 19.5 percent for the
former; from 11.5 to 8 percent for the latter &cbrack; , the absolute values
of re-exports have invariably surpassed those of domestic exports in the same
period . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#30:1>
Secondly , the gap between the service and manufacturing sectors
&rsquo; contributions to the economy is widening .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#31:1>
Service sector contribution to GDP increased from 60 to 67 percent
over the years 1970 to 1989 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#32:1>
During this same period , the contribution of the manufacturing
sector declined from 31 to 18 percent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#33:1>
Similarly the proportion of the work force employed by the
service sector has grown from 41 to 62 percent from 1971 to 1990 , while that
of the manufacturing sector has decreased from 47 to 28 percent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#34:1>
Thirdly , the betterment of the service sector , notably in
finance , technology transfer , and business logistics , has enabled Hong
Kong manufacturers to engage in off-shore production and production sharing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#35:1>
It has been estimated that between 1.5 to 2.0 million Chinese workers
in the Pearl River Delta area are employed by Hong Kong manufacturers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#36:1>
Fourthly , the number of competitors in the manufacturing sector
has been growing in recent years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#37:1>
It has been tipped that Thailand and not surprising the Pearl River
Delta area will join the league of dragons before the little but older
dragons can turn themselves into something else . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#38:1>
Fifthly , the emergence of the Asia-Pacific as one of three major
trade blocs and the rapid growth of intra-regional trade have further
encouraged the expansion of Hong Kong  ' s service sector .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#39:1>
Currently the Asia-Pacific region jointly accounts of 60 percent of
Hong Kong  ' s trade volumes , whereas the proportion of Hong Kong  ' s domestic
exports accounted for by the US market has declined from 42 to 29 percent
form 1986 to 1990 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#40:1>
In short , what is happening is that the relative importance of
Hong Kong  ' s domestic exports , manufacturing sector , and traditional
markets and competitors is changing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#41:1>
If one scans the environment , one can see that our competitors are
becoming our customers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#42:1>
Within this environment , it is unfortunate that the Government  ' s
main <-> proirities </-> <+> priorities </+> &obrack; as spelled out by the
Industry Department Report &cbrack; are inward looking only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#43:1>
Although the recognition that demand and production patterns in the
manufacturing sector are changing &obrack; &hash;4 &cbrack; hints at the need
for more outward looking strategies , this is not enough . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#44:1>
In short , creating the ability for Hong Kong to respond to a
changing competitive environment is not being sufficiently addressed . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#45:1>
Goals </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#46:1>
The stated goal of the Government  ' s industrial policies is
&ldquo; to improve the real earnings of employers and employees in
manufacturing by helping them to improve real output per head &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#47:1>
&obrack; Source : Hong Kong Government Industry Department Report
1988-89 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#48:1>
Such a statement merely confirms the universal principle of
profitability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#49:1>
It fails to address the key issue of how resources should be
allocated to meet demands arising from the internal and external environments .
</p> The Government  ' s goals are as inward looking as their assumptions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#50:1>
Furthermore , the Government  ' s laissez-faire means of
implementing these policies implies that businessmen are the best judges of
their own interests , and that determining the scale and growth vector of
investment in manufacturing is best left to the private sector .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#51:1>
In this environment , corporate profitability has been mistaken for
national competitiveness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#52:1>
There exists , figuratively speaking , a corporation which can
best be described as Hong Kong Industries , Inc. &obrack; HKII &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#53:1>
HKII does not seem to care about what business it is in , that is ,
in which market and with whom it competes , so long as it is making money .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#54:1>
For example , core business in the portfolio of HKII include
clothing , electrical appliances , electronics , plastics , textiles , and
timepieces .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#55:1>
These industries were not actively chosen as plum industries for
today  ' s market by HKII  ' s management .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#56:1>
Rather , this generation of HKII leaders inherited this portfolio
from its predecessors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#57:1>
With this portfolio , HKII should not lose sight of its greater
goals to develop a highly competitive industrial sector .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#58:1>
In order to do this , HKII  ' s present management will have to reduce
costs and enhance responsiveness to changing customer preferences .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#59:1>
This may lead to losses in employment opportunities , which can make
it more difficult to choose between supporting losers and aiding winners in
face of fierce competition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#60:1>
But HKII leaders must make these difficult choices .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#61:1>
They should not allow themselves to be dictated by rules designed for
past production-oriented generations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#62:1>
Earlier generations enjoyed the benefits of the baby-boom consumption
craze .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#63:1>
But goods today do not sell so easily , no matter how impressive the
output per worker or how superior the product quality may be . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#64:1>
If these old habits continue to dominate the industry ,
businessmen are not necessarily the best judges of Hong Kong  ' s interests .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#65:1>
Who then should be expected to take care of Hong Kong  ' s
interests when it comes to making decisions on where and when to put our
taxpayers &rsquo; money to use ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#66:1>
Not business alone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#67:1>
The responsibility lies with the Trade and Industry Branch , the
IDB , and the IDC to come up with a market-driven , customer-oriented
strategy to secure long-term corporate and societal well-being . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#68:1>
Alternative Strategies </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#69:1>
The Government seldom resorts to protective measures because of
belief in the virtue of a relatively open economy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#70:1>
The main form of intervention is said to be &lsquo; developmental
&rsquo; , that is encouraging productivity growth , quality improvement , and
design innovation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#71:1>
This goes hand in hand with the more general strategy of keeping a
superior physical and marketing infrastructure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#72:1>
The programmes in place to implement these strategies include :
&obrack; 1 &cbrack; provision of industrial land; &obrack; 2 &cbrack;
provision of manpower; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; determination of market
constraints on industrial development; &obrack; 4 &cbrack; provision of
standards , calibration , and quality certification services; &obrack; 5
&cbrack; provision of assistance to overcome technological constraints on
industrial development; and &obrack; 6 &cbrack; technological advancement .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#73:1>
This production-oriented &lsquo; strategy &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#74:1>
characteristic of the 1960s and 1970s , falls short of what is
required of a proactive strategy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#75:1>
A case in point is the Trade Description &obrack; Amendment
&cbrack; Bill , to be enacted July 1 this year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#76:1>
The bill allows knitting firms to finish the linking process across
the border without fear of not being able to obtain their Country of Origin
Certificates &obrack; COCs &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#77:1>
That has led workers , particularly operators of circular knitting
machines , to accuse the Government of colluding with the manufacturers to
sacrifice their  ' rice bowls for the so-called competitiveness &rsquo; of the
apparel industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#78:1>
Transferring the linking process from local to mainland
production facilities could have been foreseen .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#79:1>
Arrangement to retrain the operators could have been made a few years
back when US stipulations delisted the process as a requirement for COCs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#80:1>
Yet the Government continued to take into account the linking process
before issuing COCs , which created <-> an </-> <+> a </+> redundancy in the
process . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#81:1>
It is debatable in this case whether the Government was simply
too slow to make a move , or its interpretation of the idea of
competitiveness is too narrow .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#82:1>
Either way , it shows that the Government has adopted an approach too
reactionary and unassuming for shaping one  ' s competitive environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#83:1>
In addition , focusing on building up a superior infrastructure
may destabilise the market , which may be indicated by : &obrack; 1 &cbrack;
the service sector benefiting more than the manufacturing sector because of
the former  ' s dependency on infrastructural efficiency; &obrack; 2 &cbrack;
financial resources being misallocated to infrastructural development; and
&obrack; 3 &cbrack; the capital pool becoming smaller and capital investments
in the industrial sector being reduced . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#84:1>
The first alternative to the &lsquo; strategy &rsquo; is to
pursue a growth strategy in knowledge-intensive industries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#85:1>
The idea is to make use of revenues generated by the labour-intensive
industries including clothing , consumer electronics , footwear , textiles ,
toys and the material-intensive industries including plastics to support
industries with : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; a higher technological content &obrack;
e.g. biotechnology and information technology &cbrack; ; &obrack; 2 &cbrack;
higher value-added products; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; a rapidly expanding
world market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#86:1>
Adopting this growth strategy would confirm the contribution of
the manufacturing sector to the economy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#87:1>
The knowledge-intensive industries are thus expected to : &obrack; 1
&cbrack; serve a global market; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; generate foreign exchange
earnings; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; employ a large portion of the labour force ,
offering often higher wages than in the service sector; &obrack; 4 &cbrack;
optimise the utilisation of labour resources through automation; and &obrack;
5 &cbrack; continue providing linkages between the manufacturing and the
service sectors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#88:1>
The second alternative is a retrenchment strategy whereby
industries will be either consolidated by encouraging mergers of smaller
firms and limiting upstream expansions or &lsquo; given away &rsquo; to the
Pearl River Delta area , leaving behind more sophisticated industries and a
service-dominant economy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#89:1>
In this way , Hong Kong will be less burdened by fixed capital
investment in the manufacturing sector and better positioned to play the role
of an entrepot in the provision of industry-based services such as R&D ,
purchasing , testing , warehousing , and servicing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#90:1>
This seems to be a more viable alternative at this point in time
because : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; there is a global recession , as well as a
downturn in more traditional industries; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; new service
industries keep coming up; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; the increase in interest rates
will lead to the establishment of more financial enterprises; and &obrack; 4
&cbrack; the diffusion of technical changes from Hong Kong to the Pearl River
Delta area can be achieved with relative ease . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#91:1>
The third alternative combines the first two .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#92:1>
An approach based on the Boston Consulting Group matrix would foster
&lsquo; problem children &rsquo; , invest in the &lsquo; stars &rsquo; , milk
the &lsquo; cows &rsquo; , and let the &lsquo; dogs &rsquo; go .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#93:1>
That is , different industries call for different treatments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#94:1>
In this light , the two alternative strategies would complement
each other , and the combined or two-pronged strategy , if adopted , will
give local competitors a long needed sense of direction. Implementation It is
believed that the two-pronged strategy could address issues of competitive
advantage , growth vector , strategic flexibility , and synergy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#95:1>
But there will be difficulties in carrying out the programmes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#96:1>
Restrictions on transferring hi-tech from the US to China , for
instance , may hinder growth of local high-tech industries and diffusion of
technical changes to the Pearl River Delta area . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#97:1>
The Government may also have to refrain from : &obrack; 1
&cbrack; supporting industries already partly through the product life cycle;
&obrack; e &cbrack; rationalisation; &obrack; 3 &cbrack; providing export
subsidies; &obrack; 4 &cbrack; supporting firms that are incapable of
penetrating export markets; and &obrack; 5 &cbrack; supporting firms that are
already competing successfully in export markets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#98:1>
That is to say , the Government may want to support : &obrack; 1
&cbrack; small to medium-sized local firms; &obrack; 2 &cbrack; firms
competing in areas where the entry barriers are relatively high; &obrack; 3
&cbrack; technologically progressive firms; &obrack; 4 &cbrack; firms in
early phase of development; &obrack; 5 &cbrack; firms with promising
employment growth; &obrack; 6 &cbrack; firms with above-average
profitability; and &obrack; 7 &cbrack; firms or R&D projects rather than
industries . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#99:1>
In order to provide this type of support , the Government must
make improvements in three key areas : &obrack; 1 &cbrack; HRD; &obrack; 2
&cbrack; market information; and &obrack; 3 &cbrack; commitment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#100:1>
Current efforts to produce R&D personnel and promote market-oriented
R&D must be stepped up , and the practice of opening up companies to foreign
managerial and technological professionals must be continued .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#101:1>
A business intelligence system may have to be set up to process
market information to develop captive technology and proprietary knowledge .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#102:1>
Lastly , the Government must demonstrate a commitment to an
industrial strategy by delegating authority to certain agencies , and
embarking on joint leadership with the private sector .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#103:1>
The success of such a strategy will hinge partly on whether the
private sector is willing , and able , to make some technical , social and
political adjustments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-012#104:1>
Such potential hurdles notwithstanding , an industrial strategy
can be formulated without too great a difficulty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-012#105:1>
And time is , of course , not on our side . </p> </I>
