Welcome back to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X2:1:Z>
In this second part of the programme we  ' ll be discussing the
findings of the latest pay trend survey which is predicted that most
employees will get smaller pay rises next year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X3:1:Z>
With the inflation at nearly nine percent will the union accept
this

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X4:1:Z>
And what will be the implications for civil servants

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X5:1:Z>
Joining me in the studio are spokesman from the Institute of
Personal Management Gloria Chan and the Chief Executive of the Confederation
of Trade Unions Lee Cheuk Yan

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X6:1:Z>
Good evening to you both

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X7:1:Z>
Can you just sort of briefly tell us exactly what <{> <[> the </[>
results of your survey were </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#8:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#9:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#10:1:A>
The Hong Kong Institute of Personal Management conduct its annual
<.> su </.> patron survey every year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#11:1:A>
Uh for this year we have a hundred and two companies from thirteen
different industrial and business sector

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#12:1:A>
It covers around a hundred and thirty thousand employees

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#13:1:A>
And the total average increase <.> f </.> this year is eleven point
six percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#14:1:A>
When compared to the increase last year that is two point four
percent <,> that means there would be an <,> <.> d </.> uh down turn of zero
point nine percent

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X15:1:Z>
But these pay increases were still above inflation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#16:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X17:1:Z>
What will is your uh what  ' s your reaction to the results of
theses surveys </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#18:1:B>
I think uhm uh the only thing about this survey is we we
believe that actually those employee who earn less actually had less pay
increase cos uhm uh for example uh to take the government wage statistic as
an example

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#19:1:B>
Uh like in the garment trade <,> uh the percentage increase in <.>
on </.> only six percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#20:1:B>
And even in service industry uh like the bank teller had only nine
percent increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#21:1:B>
The retail shop assistant had only two percent increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#22:1:B>
So actually what is happening I would say in in Hong Kong is those
who are the low income group had even worse pay trend <.> incre </.> uh pay
increase than those in the upper strata of employee

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#23:1:B>
So the trend will be the the the gap between the uh highly-paid
workers and the very low-paid worker will be even wider

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#24:1:B>
So I think our concern <.> i </.> is that uhm how how to make this
gap lower or how to make sure that the living standard of the low income
group can improve

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X25:1:Z>
Is what Lee Cheuk Yah saying correct but as I think you said in
your survey that the people who would be uhm received the lowest <.> sal </.>
salary increases were in fact senior management </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#26:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#27:1:A>
That would be the trend record by our survey

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#28:1:A>
The most senior people that is the top level staff receive only
eleven point something <,> whereas the junior staff that is the middle and
the junior <.> s </.> the general level staff they receive over twelve
percent <,> overall increases

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#29:1:B>
I <{> <[> I think </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X30:1:Z>
<[> So it seems </[> </{> to be a conflict <{> <[> here I I mean
you mention <[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#31:1:B>
<[> Yah I think the </[> </{> the their category is like uh
for the general trend

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#32:1:B>
They have uh I think hundred sixty thousand uh <{> <[> per </[>
year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#33:1:B>
Uh but hundred sixty thousand is already about uh uh ten thousand
twelve thousand per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#34:1:B>
And so I what I  ' m saying is like those uh that are under six
thousand seven thousand

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#35:1:B>
Those really the lowest strata of the employee will have the worse
hit and will worse uh pay increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#36:1:B>
And I think the senior management had one different I would say

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#37:1:B>
The senior management had far better uhm fringe benefit than the
than the middle management

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#38:1:B>
So I what our belief is even if the senior management get less uh
pay increase their living standard would not lower because they have all the
protection in uh uh <.> f </.> are open to them

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#39:1:B>
But the lowest strata uh the pay increases is everything

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#40:1:B>
They they they will have far less fringe benefit than the senior
management

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#41:1:B>
So that is another different that we have to take note

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#42:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X43:1:Z>
Do you take into account perks which uh senior management get when
you do your surveys </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#44:1:A>
No we just base on basic salary

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#45:1:A>
But I suppose that Mr Lee is right because to a certain extent he
talk about the manufacturing sector or the blue collar labours whereas our
survey the majority of the employee population are most probably the white
white collar <{> <[> <,> </[> employees

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#46:1:A>
That means there will be some difference in the interpretation of
the survey

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X47:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#48:1:B>
But but I think even within the service industry those uh that
are in the lowest strata like the dish washer the ordinary waiter the
security guards

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#49:1:B>
Really those low income group in the service industry do also do
not really have any uh uh better increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#50:1:B>
But I think the clerical staff those who have form five standard
better education standard they will be the one that can compete in the market

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#51:1:B>
And so we are very worry that uh as this go on the low income group
will be very badly hit

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X52:1:Z>
Will well you must be very concerned that if the latest survey
shows that in fact salary increases are going to be even lower next year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X53:1:Z>
And what do you think going to be the reaction of of your union
members </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#54:1:B>
Uhm firstly uhm the <.> re </.> the the trend is going low

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#55:1:B>
Not just because of the market <,> it  ' s also because a deliberate
effort I would say on the part of the <.> b </.> uh business group especially
the employers group to uh suppress wage increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#56:1:B>
Uh every year the before the every company is setting their budget
for next year the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce the Employer  ' s
Association will announce their recommendation for the wage wage increase
next year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#57:1:B>
Uh in the past they have tried inflation minus two and they and the
inflation plus one

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#58:1:B>
And we heard that this year is about uhm nine point five percent
that they are going to recommend

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#59:1:B>
So it is a deliberate effort on the part of the business to
suppress the wages and also with the cooperation of the government of course
government had their own interest in suppressing wage increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#60:1:B>
So both together they are trying to get the wage increase to make
sure it is as low <.> a </.> as possible

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#61:1:B>
So uh I don't think it just market

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#62:1:B>
It  ' s now being an joint effort on the part of the government and
the uh business group to <{> <[> do that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X63:1:Z>
<[> Well </[> </{> I mean the government has got a very big
concern and that is the high inflation rate and surely if it allow salary
increases salary <unc> one word </unc> and that  ' s also going to
contribute to higher inflation </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#64:1:B>
But there are so many factor that contribute to inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#65:1:B>
Why they always ask the workers to sacrifice

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#66:1:B>
That  ' s a basic question

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#67:1:B>
They never ask like uh of course one factor to contribute to uh the
the <.> s </.> the inflation is the property speculation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#68:1:B>
They never did anything <,> <{> <[> to on that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X69:1:Z>
<[> Well I think that the government </[> </{> has been taking
measures to measures <{> <[> to <unc> two words </unc> </[> <{> <[>
is that </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#70:1:B>
<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#71:1:B>
<[> It  ' s still </[> </{> go up

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#72:1:B>
And and it is contributing to inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#73:1:B>
And then when worker to <.> s </.> say we are trying to catch up
with inflation what happens is no

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#74:1:B>
You <.> ha </.> you are not suppose to catch up with inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#75:1:B>
You are the factor that contribute to inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#76:1:B>
That  ' s that  ' s not the way to argue I think

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#77:1:B>
So what we <.> f </.> what we believe is is very unfair to workers
when they put all the responsibility of inflation on the workers on the wages
part and not uh <.> conti </.> <.> at </.> attribute the factor to those that
<.> hi </.> <.> b </.> hit the business group

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#78:1:B>
So I I think is is is totally uh unacceptable

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X79:1:Z>
Do you uh Lee Cheuk Yan has said that uh in fact employers have
tired to suppress wages

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X80:1:Z>
Uh is is that sort of your information do your surveys tell you
with that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#81:1:A>
Uhm the institute itself would not would not comment on how
the employers going to uh what the employees  '  uh <.> g </.> reaction will be

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#82:1:A>
We just look at the salary increase from the very objective point
of view <,> in in terms of a personal professional <,> uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X83:1:Z>
But you look at the reasons as to why the salaries increase is
going to go down or if your survey shows they  ' re going up as you know the
reasons behind the trends </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#84:1:A>
Uhm because the inflation rate has been going coming down in
this few years

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#85:1:A>
I mean gradually although it  ' s a little bit slow not so quick as
we expect that  ' s why it  ' s logical that the salary increase would go down
together with the inflation rate

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#86:1:B>
So actually you can see the trend is uh always the wage
increases just about the level to the inflation the the average one

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#87:1:B>
The lower income group will have even worse as I  ' ve explained

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#88:1:B>
And and so uh workers in Hong Kong can never really share the
prosperity then <,> cos uh every year we have five percent uh uh economic
growth in GNP

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#89:1:B>
So supposedly we are supposed to share a five percent <,> that five
percent but never we never share that five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#90:1:B>
We only get about at at most one percent more than inflation

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#91:1:B>
But we never get the five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#92:1:B>
So it  ' s it  ' s it  ' s it show one thing that even if Hong Kong
prosper even the economic growth is not the workers then really benefit too
much

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#93:1:B>
They really only get peanuts out of the whole economic growth

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X94:1:Z>
Every year though when we have these patron survey and the the
latest round of government and civil service salary increases are published
you complain that in fact it  ' s always the lowest strata it  ' s always the
workers who are affected

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X95:1:Z>
What are you actually going to do about it

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X96:1:Z>
What would you like what action do you think your unions are going
to be taking for next year </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#97:1:B>
I think basically there are uh two major thing that I <.> th
</.> we think it  ' s very important in order to improve the uh wage <.> s </.>
level of workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#98:1:B>
One is we must grab the importation of labour scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#99:1:B>
And for <?> <.> shu </.> </?> we that scheme is taking away job
opportunity

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#100:1:B>
Disturbing intervening into the labour market uh against the
interest of workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#101:1:B>
So if we want to have more wage increase we have to do away with
the importation labour scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#102:1:B>
So that there  ' s one priority of the labour movement

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#103:1:B>
And second is uh the union should have the right to collect the
<unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#104:1:B>
Unless we can bargain for our wage unless the employer can <.> rec
</.> uh willing to recognise union and bargain over the negotiation table we
can never break this uh joint effort of the government and employer against
wage increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#105:1:B>
And so uh another thing we have always advocate for and is always
pushing for is the right to collect the <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#106:1:B>
And but uh so far the government still refuse to <{> <[> do that
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X107:1:Z>
<[> And the </[> </{> government look set to continuing it  ' s
continuing to refuse all theses points

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X108:1:Z>
And certainly the importation of labour is a scheme which the
government completely committed to

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X109:1:Z>
And isn't going to reverse that now

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X110:1:Z>
So what you think I mean uh for the next coming year I say again
what you think you can do to bear in mind the fact the government doesn't
look like it  ' s to going change its mind </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#111:1:B>
Yah I think it  ' s not the question should not be to us

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#112:1:B>
What are we going to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#113:1:B>
I think we should ask the workers

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#114:1:B>
What are you going to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#115:1:B>
Are you going to uhm tolerate it anymore <{> <[> or </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X116:1:Z>
<[> And </[> </{> do you think they will or not </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#117:1:B>
They have to some of them cos with the importation labour
with a very low unionisation rate they have to tolerate for some more years

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#118:1:B>
But I think it should be a starting point <,> where they begin to
say that oh we have enough we should unite we should get together and demand
for our rightful share

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#119:1:B>
And I think uhm we are we will response to that of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#120:1:B>
And and we hope that workers really can uh come out and and really
uh <{> <[> <,> </[> put forward demands and negotiate with their employer for
a better pay increase

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#121:1:B>
And we are always there to support them

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#122:1:?> <[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X123:1:Z>
Do you think perhaps your survey should take into account what
the <.> l </.> lower levels of society of earning as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X124:1:Z>
I mean the workers are supposed to just <unc> one word
</unc> middle and senior management </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#125:1:A>
You refer to our survey

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X126:1:Z>
Yes <{> <[> yes </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#127:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#128:1:A>
Uhm our survey mainly on the white collar

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X129:1:Z>
But don't you think it should be broader than that </X> <A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#130:1:Z>
Uh it depends very much on what kind of business sectors that we  ' re
going to have

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#131:1:Z>
In the thirteen business sector we have only one manufacturing
sector <,> basically the blue collar one

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#132:1:Z>
But we also have the retail and hotel sector

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#133:1:Z>
Both sector have <,> given out the lowest increase last year

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#134:1:Z>
But the reason behind would be for the hotel sectors

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#135:1:Z>
They  ' re going to have the tips additional income as tips <.> apo
</.> apart from the basic <{> <[> salary </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#136:1:Z>
And for the retail sector that are going to have the sales
commission

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#137:1:Z>
Therefore the basic salaries factor may not be the main component
of the whole pay package

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X138:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X139:1:Z>
Well I should have to stop you both there

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X140:1:Z>
Thank you very much for indeed for joining us on the programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X141:1:Z>
That brings an end to this edition of Newsline but do join us
again at the same time next week

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X142:1:Z>
Good night </X> </I>


<I>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X143:2:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re going to turn now to the health side of
Elizabeth Wong  ' s job is Secretary for Health and Welfare

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X144:2:Z>
Now twenty six percent increase in public ward bed charges has
just been announced

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X145:2:Z>
How sure are you that the uh working class are going to be able
to afford that kind of increase </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#146:2:A>
Well at the moment we have in place an existing uh waiver
system anybody can apply and get it waived

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#147:2:A>
Uh if you can't pay even the uh what is it forty three dollars per
<{> <[> day </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#148:2:B>
<[> Thirty </[> </{> four

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#149:2:A>
Uh thirty four has <{1> <[1> been </[1> <{2> <[2> revised
</[2> to forty three

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#150:2:A>
Uhm if you can't uh pay for that in fact there  ' re lots of people
still can't pay for that because in our uh <{3> <[3> past statistics </[3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#151:2:B>
<[1> Aw I see </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#152:2:C>
<[2> Yup </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X153:2:Z>
<[3> What about the people </[3> </{3> that that can afford

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#X154:2:Z>
I mean they can pay for it but may not necessarily be able to
afford it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#155:2:A>
Well uh I think there is uh inequity in the existing system

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#156:2:A>
This is system we want to look at

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#157:2:A>
Because at the present moment well it  ' s a flat rate

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#158:2:A>
It  ' s <.> irres </.> irrespective whether people can afford or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#159:2:A>
It  ' s one flat rate for everybody

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#160:2:A>
So because of its uhm uh uniqueness it it it creates a kind of
inequity uh in itself

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#161:2:A>
People who can afford to pay uhm more don't have to

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#162:2:A>
So uhm people who can't afford get their waive

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#163:2:A>
But what  ' s the result

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#164:2:A>
Long waiting list

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#165:2:A>
There <.> w </.> those people who can't afford the waiting <,> uh
time then they have to pay through their nose perhaps uh to look elsewhere

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#166:2:B>
I thought that  ' s <.> w </.> a corner stone of the government  ' s
health policy

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#167:2:B>
<{> <[> Is is to drive </[> people away from the public hospitals
<{> <[> into the private hospital </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#168:2:A>
<[> It was a corner stone </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#169:2:A>
<[> Well </[> </{> uh it has been a uh it has been often described
that the governments  '  uh policy is <unc> one word </unc> through uh
chronic uh uh uh shortage of funds </{> <[> et cetera </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#170:2:A>
But that  ' s not good enough for now

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#171:2:A>
I think we we were uhm creating numbers after the war

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#172:2:A>
But now we  ' ve uh reached the stage where we have to go up to
quality service

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#173:2:A>
I don't think anybody can now accept uhm the sort of uh situation
we accepted five years ago even you know <{> <[> can't </[> <?> bears </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#174:2:A>
It should be up

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#175:2:B>
<[> That  ' s right </[> </{>

<$?> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#176:2:?> <[> Uh </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#177:2:C>
But I I really have to stress a few points when talk we talk
about quality service

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#178:2:C>
Now Hong Kong is is not lacking in quality of medical care

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#179:2:C>
We what we are lacking is quality of the environment more than
anything else

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#180:2:C>
<.> Ther </.> but there are couple of points which I was were very
important

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#181:2:C>
I  ' ve I  ' d like to take this up with with <?> Elizabeth </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#182:2:C>
First thing is that uh she has stated repeatedly and I fully agree
and that is nobody should be <,> uh devoid of care simply because uh lack of
means

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#183:2:C>
I think this is a very important policy which government <.> es es
</.> establish and which is written very specifically in the law of the
Hospital Authority

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#184:2:C>
I think that  ' s very very important

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#185:2:C>
Second thing we all look into is that <,> <.> u f </.> in the
years to come and in years that has passed medical cost <,> is increasing

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#186:2:C>
And increasing tremendously

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#187:2:C>
There really is a need to look at how government funds <,> medical
care at end of the day

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#188:2:C>
<{> <[> I think </[> that  ' s important

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#189:2:B>
<[> The </[> </{> the the trouble is you you I I  ' m very uh
very heartened by what Mrs Wong has said

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#190:2:B>
But the problem with means test is that they also go against the
<unc> one-word </unc> of Hong Kong  ' s traditional way of doing things

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#191:2:A>
Absolutely

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#192:2:B>
<{> <[> Tax concession </[> you said is too complicated to
minister

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#193:2:B>
The same thing with means test

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#194:2:A>
<[> I agree with you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#195:2:A>
Absolutely because we are not I hope we will not get ourselves all
into this means testing kind of philosophy

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#196:2:A>
I would uh believe in uhm personal uhm declaration you know in
terms of uhm people uhm patients who can't afford

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#197:2:A>
Uhm they declare they can't afford

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#198:2:A>
And I think we should trust them because who would wants to be ill
in the <{> <[> first </[> place

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#199:2:A>
Who wants to uh cheat in the second place

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#200:2:A>
I think Hong Kong has an infrastructure on medical and health
which is no turn away policy

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#201:2:A>
Anybody who gets uhm to a hospital gets looked after

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#202:2:A>
So what can be better than that

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#203:2:A>
But the defect is in itself it creates a kind of inequity

<ICE-HK:S1B-026#204:2:A>
So we  ' ve got to <,> move from the current foundation which is
good into something better

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-026#205:2:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> </I>
