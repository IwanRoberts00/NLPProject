Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X2:1:Z>
City University Professor Li Shaomin was convicted of spying in
China and deported but Hong Kong let him return to the SAR

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X3:1:Z>
Was the Hong Kong  ' s decision legally consistent with China  ' s
decision to expel him from the country

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X4:1:Z>
Is it now time for Hong Kong to elect and the subversion
legislation

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X5:1:Z>
<?> Professor </?> discuss this issue are Senior Councillor Alan
Hoo and Professor Lau Siu Kai of the Chinese University

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X6:1:Z>
Gentlemen welcome

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X7:1:Z>
Alan if I may start of you as a layer can you tell us <,> where
does the law stand

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X8:1:Z>
Uh uh Li Shaomin was expel from China and yet he was able to come
to Hong Kong which is part of China

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X9:1:Z>
How how <,> you explain that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#10:1:A>
I think that uh you start of with the fact Li Shaomin met all
the legal requirements for immigration entry into Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#11:1:A>
He has a valid passport <,> he has a right to be uh resigning here

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#12:1:A>
He has a right to to work here

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#13:1:A>
He has not been declared <unc> one-word </unc> in terms of
uh uhm a person who  ' s not welcome in Hong Kong because of Hong Kong  ' s own
security matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#14:1:A>
So he met all the <,> requirements that give him <unc> one-word
</unc> right of entry

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#15:1:A>
But the question obviously is because of his conviction and
expulsion from China uh that an issue of whether he  ' s affect national
security arises

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#16:1:A>
But when such issue arises I would uh thought that the uh the
procedure that would <,> coming to play is that the central government would
notify <,> Hong Kong the SARG <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh whether this person who
has engaged activities which is incompatible with national security uh in the
mainland that uh he would be classified a person who is affect the national
security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#17:1:A>
And with that sort of notification uh evidence should be supplied

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#18:1:A>
And I say that because uh if Li Shaomin was decline entry on the
ground that he is affect national security then he has a right to challenge
that decision in the court of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#19:1:A>
Because he  ' s got <unc> one-word </unc> permission to come
in <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#20:1:A>
And when the matters look at by the court in Hong Kong then
evidence have to be produced <,> by the SARG

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#21:1:A>
So I think that the uh the the decision uhm is not incompatible in
so far that if he is affect national security then the obligation should be
on the central government <{2> <[2> to inform </[2> the Hong Kong government

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X22:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X23:1:Z>
<[2> And </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X24:1:Z>
Do you know <?> if </?> the central government has informed the
Hong Kong government that he is not affected national security </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#25:1:A>
I I don't know there is affect but I would assume <,> uh that
if the central government has inform the Hong Kong government <,> uh then the
Hong Kong government would not uh have a uhm its own free decision uh to
ignore that <{1> <[1> that </[1> particular <,> piece of <{2> <[2>
information </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X26:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X27:1:Z>
<[2> Now </[2> </{2> S K the central government has not said
anything in public about Hong Kong  ' s decision to allow him back in

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X28:1:Z>
Uh do you do you think the central government is unhappy with this
decision </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#29:1:B>
Well how can the central government say anything in public <,>
when the whole thing is uh uh a case of Hong Kong serve in the interest of
Sino-American relationship and the

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#30:1:B>
When when you look at case <,> in such a manner for example <,> if
Beijing want to improve relationship with the States but releasing some
people who are who are are are accuse of uh <?> serving </?> a spy

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#31:1:B>
Then if these people <,> are <,> expel from China and they are not
allow to come into Hong Kong <,> Beijing  ' s purpose to to improve
relationship with States will not be served

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#32:1:B>
<{> <[> At the </[> same time <,> Hong Kong reputation of operating
under the principle of One Country Two System will also be <,> uh uh <.> un
</.> under suspicion

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#33:1:B>
So there  ' s the the the whole thing is uh a can be seen more in a
political manner <,> from a political perspective

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#34:1:B>
And the from that perspective the faith can be easily understood

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X35:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X36:1:Z>
So you  ' re saying that it  ' s not really a legal issue it  ' s a
political issue </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#37:1:B>
Well it may have some legal aspects but the to me <,> uh uh if
you take the Li Shaomin case will get of other cases <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#38:1:B>
Uh including the four coming cases uh we the whole the whole game
is clear

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#39:1:B>
It  ' s a political game

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X40:1:Z>
Uh now Alan the Director of Immigration says he did did not
consulted the <{1> <[1> central </[1> government before allowing uh Li
Shaomin into Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X41:1:Z>
But he did consult the uh Department of Justice <{2> <[2> and
</[2> the Security Bureau

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X42:1:Z>
Uh do you <,> uh do you think that at a higher level of the Hong
Kong government they consult the central government before making this
decision </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#43:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#44:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#45:1:A>
I think that they must have grants uh to consult

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#46:1:A>
I think that if <,> it  ' s a <,> such an open uhm acknowledge that
uh Li Shaomin was convicted and expelled

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#47:1:A>
Uh and if the central government chose not to inform the Hong Kong
government that this person in their opinion poses a risk <{> <[> to </[>
national security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#48:1:A>
And of course <,> when it comes to matters of defence and national
security I don't think it  ' s a matter within Hong Kong autonomy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X49:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X50:1:Z>
I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X51:1:Z>
Uh a lot of people have cited this case as <,> uh prove that <.>
un </.> the One Country Two System  ' s concept is working

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X52:1:Z>
<{> <[> But </[> you don't see it that way </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#53:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#54:1:A>
I I do see it working but I see it working from the perspective of
one country

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#55:1:A>
I think that matter  ' s uh concerning the security of the state must
be a a question which concern everybody in the country

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#56:1:A>
Uh I think that the two systems only serve to divide the different
society models uh that are in place between Hong Kong and the Mainland

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X57:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X58:1:Z>
Well uh S K I think when the Hong Kong government uh announced
that they had allow Professor Li back into Hong Kong they said that it was an
immigration issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X59:1:Z>
An immigration within Hong Kong autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X60:1:Z>
Do you accept that argument </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#61:1:B>
Well basically I I I I I <,> I <?> accept </?> the fact that
the government position

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#62:1:B>
<{1> <[1> I don't </[1> think the government expected Li Shaomin to
come back to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#63:1:B>
I mean that  ' s why when Li Shaomin did come back the the the
government was uh caught in a in a <.> un </.> unexpected and it takes a long
time for it to come out decision decision <unc> one-word </unc>
helper consulting Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#64:1:B>
But the uh <,> on the on the other hand I I would say that uh uh
<,> the the government  ' s decision is <,> based primary on national
consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#65:1:B>
That  ' s why when Tung Chee Hwa is <unc> one-word </unc> the
case <,> invention consideration national interest and Hong Kong interest
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#66:1:B>
What lie behind it is some sort of China  ' s international <,> uh
relationship

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#67:1:B>
So if that is the case <,> to if if Tung really want to explain it
as an immigration case he should spell in more detail <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#68:1:B>
What does that mean by allowing Li Shaomin back in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#69:1:B>
But <,> it appears to me that in the first place Tung does not want
<,> to elaborate too much on that case <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#70:1:B>
Secondly I don't think the government want to see this as a
precedent <,> uh which will be followed in in the future that to another
question <.> con </.> convicted as a spy in in China will be allow
automatically <,> back in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#71:1:B>
So I would say that the government  ' s position is uh <,> is pretty
clear on the one hand it  ' s it try to depict an image of a a case under
political consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#72:1:B>
Secondly it does not want to set up precedent

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X73:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X74:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X75:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X76:1:Z>
But actually if uh this is an immigration case and uh Hong Kong
consulted Beijing uh on whether to <,> accept somebody uh when immigration is
within our autonomy

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X77:1:Z>
Isn't Hong Kong undermining its autonomy by consulting central
government trust </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#78:1:A>
It it <?> evidence </?> immigration pure immigration matter
yes but but I think there is no dispute uh when they comes to national
security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#79:1:A>
It it it  ' s a question which affect the whole country

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#80:1:A>
And I think that if the central government does not of its owner
cost supply information <,> uh to the Hong Kong government

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#81:1:A>
Then on what base can Hong Kong government had in interest of
national security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#82:1:A>
<{1> <[1> So </[1> all it can do is to look at the case in terms of
his <,> cost activities in Hong Kong when he allow to enter

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#83:1:A>
And I presume that in the four hours of questioning that he had at
the Chek Lap Kok Airport <{2> <[2> that was </[2> what the Immigration
authority will <?> doing </?> try to establish whether his activities here is
going to be inconsistent uh with the uh the uh the interest of <,> of
security whether both in Hong Kong <{3> <[3> or </[3> nationally

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#84:1:A>
But they certainly won't given any information from the central
government uh for them to be able to take a position to say just because you
expelled by China you expelled from the whole country including Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#85:1:A>
I I believe that it did not happen

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X86:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X87:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X88:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X89:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#90:1:B>
I <?> hope </?> I want to add one point that is uh <,> as far
as I uh understand according to Beijing  ' s view immigration policy is not one
hundred percent <,> autonomy for Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#91:1:B>
For example Hong Kong cannot uh uh for forbid people into Hong Kong
those are are allow by legally allow by by by by Beijing to come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#92:1:B>
So in fact when we talk about a high degree of autonomy as far as
immigration policy is concerned we have to be aware that there are other
consideration put with the with certain extend <,> limit that autonomy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X93:1:Z>
Uh S K you had said early as that this is primarily a political
issue with uh some legal aspect

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X94:1:Z>
Uh now do you think the central government is happy uh uh about
Hong Kong allowing him in

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X95:1:Z>
Uh I I see that the Foreign Ministry uh Commissioner in Hong Kong
has been quoted and said that Hong Kong made uh the right decision and and Lu
Ping the former Director of Hong Kong Macau Affairs Office has also said that
this is One Country Two System <?> and </?> action <{> <[> so is </[> the
central government quite happy with this situation do you think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#96:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#97:1:B>
Well I would say that central government <,> would the see
this some something which is inevitable

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#98:1:B>
I don't think it see it as some where happy event

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#99:1:B>
As far as I understand Beijing really does not expect Li Shaomin to
come back to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#100:1:B>
But uh since he decides to come back Beijing is also caught in
dilemma

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#101:1:B>
But as far as I know Beijing is not happy but Beijing would find
the situation <,> uh to be accepted in a sense that uh it would <.> con </.>
it will contribute <{> <[> to </[> uh Hong Kong  ' s <,> uh high degree of
autonomy as perceived by the international community

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#102:1:B>
At the same time it will share China  ' s purposes in in terms of
its relationship with the States

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X103:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X104:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X105:1:Z>
Now Alan uh aside from uh Hong Kong decision to let him back in

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X106:1:Z>
Uh are there any legal issues involve in the City University  ' s
decision to continue the employment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#107:1:A>
Well I think that uh <,> I don't know how the uh internal
workings of the City University <?> heres </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#108:1:A>
But I think that once he  ' s uh allowed in <,> and uh that he can
not only resign but work here uh and again I think City University has their
public public status

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#109:1:A>
They are in no better position <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> than the Hong
Kong government

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#110:1:A>
They are not informed at all as to as to the uh the full details
of the <unc> one-word </unc> activities that which reach the
<unc> one-word </unc> law in China

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#111:1:A>
Uh so I think that <,> to me I I to uh cannot accept that this is
uh a uhm a political uh situation where it it it  ' s <{2> <[2> it  ' s a </[2>
matter which was <,> political settled to the satisfaction of all parties

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#112:1:A>
I think it  ' s clearly an issue where the central government either
because of the <?> marriage </?> of the case in terms of uh the <?>
capability </?> level <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> or perhaps it may be other
considerations uh policy consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#113:1:A>
But in many event they chose not to make this matter a matter of
national security that they chose not to label <,> uh uh Mr Li a person who
is a continuing threat to national security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#114:1:A>
Because if they do then it certainly a matter within not within
Hong Kong  ' s autonomy

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#115:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#116:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#117:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#118:1:Z>
Okay thank you very much

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#119:1:Z>
We  ' ll this continue this discussion after the break

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#120:1:Z>
Don't go away we  ' ll right back <&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#121:1:Z>
Welcome back we  ' re talking about the return of Hong Kong of
convicted spy Professor Li Shaomin

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#122:1:Z>
Now S K based on uh the information that has been made public so
far uh as an academic do you feel that uh Professor Li went beyond uh <.> ac
</.> academic bound <{> <[> in his </[> research in China </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#123:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#124:1:B>
Really I don't know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#125:1:B>
Because the everything is not clear <?> to </?> whether he has
committed any serious crime uh not in China

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#126:1:B>
But from what uh uh uh uh we understand Beijing policy throughout
last several decades it seems to me that uh Li Shaomin was <,> uh arrested
<,> in a contest of uh uh <,> uh <,> good Sino-American relationship

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#127:1:B>
In a contest where Beijing <,> wanted to have the Olympic Game and
wanted to enter into the WTO

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#128:1:B>
So it seems to me that there is no strong reason why Beijing
should arrest Li Shaomin in the first place

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#129:1:B>
So <,> that leads people to suspect that there may must be
something uh which has been committed by Mr Li <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> which is
seen to be very serious by Beijing whether it constitute a spy case or not I
don't think <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#130:1:B>
But the it appear to me that the <,> uh it is not necessary a
<unc> one-word </unc> case as seen by some other people <{3> <[3> but
</[3> <?> frankly </?> I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X131:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X132:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X133:1:Z>
<[3> <?> That is </?> </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X134:1:Z>
Now Alan the day after Li Shaomin return to Hong Kong uh Ta Kung
Pao the <{1> <[1> pro-Communist </[1> paper here had an editorial saying that
uh it  ' s time for Hong Kong to <?> enact </?> article twenty three
legislation

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X135:1:Z>
Now under the Basic Law Hong Kong is supposed enact this law
against subversion <?> succession </?> addition <{2> <[2> and prison </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X136:1:Z>
Do you think it is time for Hong Kong to enact such force </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#137:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#138:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#139:1:A>
I think the time is wait overdue

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#140:1:A>
I think that uhm from the point of view of uhm of constitutional
development for Hong Kong I think that a point handover <,> uh laws which are
to safeguard the security and integrity

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#141:1:A>
And in in the situation of England you have laws that uphold the
dignity of the state for example the person of the Queen

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#142:1:A>
All these are should be in place

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#143:1:A>
These are these are necessary for the effective uh resumption of
sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#144:1:A>
Uhm and I think that uh that the uh the last uh colonial regime
uhm agree to that approach because uh you remember that uh Governor Patten uh
tries to introduce uh legislation on uh subversion and <?> succession </?> uh
in ninety six

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#145:1:A>
Uh and that was to pave the way to have this in case

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#146:1:A>
So if for for for foreseen at that time was to have legislation to
make it unlawful <,> uhm for act as a that advocate the unlawful <?> Fa Lun
</?> overthrow of the government of United Kingdom

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#147:1:A>
Uh for there to be anybody who by force try to <?> subpark </?>
the lawful authority of United Kingdom over any of each territories including
uh dependent territories

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#148:1:A>
And what was <?> invisited </?> is that at the <unc> one-word
</unc> of midnight that will be adapted <,> whereby having the terms
change to central people government

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#149:1:A>
But that as we know was uh was not accepted by by the legislative
assembly at that time

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X150:1:Z>
Right and I I think that China also announced that it was not
acceptable to the Chinese <{1> <[1> government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X151:1:Z>
Now </[1> if if such legislation was in place <unc> one-word
</unc> on the book of <{2> <[2> Hong </[2> Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X152:1:Z>
Will that affected uh Li Shaonmin  ' s ability to return Hong Kong
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#153:1:A>
<[1> Yes and uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#154:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#155:1:A>
No I think that legislation is domestic it it basically uhm the
the Basic Law gives us the right to enact laws on our own <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
uh to safeguard national security interest

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#156:1:A>
Uh uh and this was deliberately uh made that way uh it  ' s not
something in it in that extreme for example national laws

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#157:1:A>
I mean we could have been force fact by the NPs by saying these
are the laws <{2> <[2> which </[2> you must enact no

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#158:1:A>
But they but they  ' ve taken the position that you can enact laws
uh with our legal approach to potential approach which will be the common law
approach

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#159:1:A>
And so article twenty three will affect the means we will enact
domestic legislation that will safeguard all these matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#160:1:A>
And that will govern activities of people in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#161:1:A>
So I think a important for people in Hong Kong to know <,> what
conduct will be uh undermining a <?> bridge </?> in national security

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#162:1:A>
I may <?> stare </?> in article twenty three but at at the moment
it just that <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> an empty an empty an empty uh <{4> <[4>
phrase </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X163:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X164:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X165:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X166:1:Z>
<[4> Uh </[4> </{4> S K do you agree uh that we should have this
laws <unc> one-word </unc> July first nineteen ninety seven </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#167:1:B>
Well under normal circumstances I would say yes because uh
Hong Kong is under obligation in uh Basic Law to give local legislation to
article twenty three

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#168:1:B>
But we have to understand that this local this article twenty
three was in certain in Basic Law uh in the uh at the last moment it during
the drafting process <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> to protect China  ' s interest

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#169:1:B>
<.> Af </.> in the after of the June Fourth event and uh <,> the
article was driven by political considerations

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#170:1:B>
But right now I would say that the <,> Beijing doesn't seem to
have to be in the hurry <,> to have that kind of local <{2> <[2> local
legislation </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X171:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X172:1:Z>
<[2> Then what about the Ta Kung Pao </[2> </{2> editorial

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#X173:1:Z>
Do you think that represent Beijing  ' s <{> <[> views </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-035#174:1:B>
<[> Well </[> </{> the problem is that there even the people
in the Pro-China camp are quite divided on the Li Shaomin issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#175:1:B>
I think Ta Kung Pao represent basically only one point of view

<ICE-HK:S1B-035#176:1:B>
Uh I don't think it necessary represent Beijing view not <,> if
you look at Li Shaomin case I would say that the the political need may be
even less than before </I>
