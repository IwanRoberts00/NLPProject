<ICE-HK:W2B-005#3:1>
<p> <bold> BY NOW , MOST </bold> people know who John Nash is , even if they
know nothing about his obscure mathematical &ldquo; game theory &rdquo; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#4:1>
<p> <it> New York Times </it> reporter Sylvia Nasar  ' s best-selling 1998
biography of the mathematical genius , <it> A Beautiful Mind </it> , and the
new blockbuster film of the same name , are threatening to do to game theory
what Albert Einstein did to physics and Bertrand Russell to mathematical
logic - make it look almost sexy . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#5:1>
<p> The film came in second in the Hong Kong box office last week and the
book has been on bookstore chain Page One  ' s bestseller list for weeks . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#6:1>
<p> Game theory studies strategies available to competing or partially
co-operating players to predict possible outcomes from available options .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#7:1>
Economists , political scientists and government planners are among
its most frequent users . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#8:1>
<p> Cheng Shiu-yuen , a mathematics professor and associate dean of science
at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , says he has started
teaching Nash  ' s Nobel Prize-winning paper in his undergraduate class now
students seem to have taken a new interest in the man .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#9:1>
&ldquo; All 28 lines of proof - it  ' s a very short paper , &rdquo;
says Professor Cheng , also a specialist in the theory . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#10:1>
<p> Nash , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia after a mental collapse at
the age of 30 but recovered in the early 1990s , has found himself embroiled
in a smear campaign after the film was nominated for eight Oscars . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#11:1>
<p> Nasar had to write to the <it> Los Angeles Times </it> this month
repudiating claims Nash was gay , an anti-Semite and a bad father .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#12:1>
To counter the rumours , Nash and his long-suffering wife Alicia
agreed to be interviewed on 60 Minutes , to be aired on ATV World at 10pm on
Thursday .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#13:1>
In the 1950s , Nash published a series of papers which helped lay a
firmer foundation for game theory by covering games with counterparts more
commonly found in the real world than those considered by early theorists .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#14:1>
<p> So Nash examines non-zero sum games , when the rewards or payoffs of a
game do not add up to zero - which is when one side takes all and the other
loses all .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#15:1>
In real life , players rarely lose or gain everything , and there is
a level of co-operation or at least tacit understanding and mutual
expectations even among bitter rivals . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#16:1>
<p> In what is now called the Nash Equilibrium , the mathematician proves
that in every game there is a set of strategies , one for each competing
player , which yields an outcome such that no player can improve his or her
situation by unilaterally switching to another strategy . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#17:1>
<p> Professor Cheng said not all was positive about the film , which
emphasised the madness rather than the mathematics , reinforcing a popular
image of scientists being madmen . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#18:1>
<p> Nash was not the first game theorist to make it into a major Hollywood
film . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#19:1>
<p> John von Neumann , one of the theory  ' s founders who advocated the US
launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the Russians , served as the
real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick  ' s classic satire
<it> Dr Strangelove </it> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#20:1>
<p> Both mathematicians might have been brilliant but they were not the
nicest of men , which may raise questions about the theory  ' s effects on
young minds . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#21:1>
<p> Richard Feynman , the late US physicist , once revealed a dark side of
the theory:  &rdquo; Von Neumann gave me a very interesting idea: that you don't
have to be responsible for the world that you  ' re in .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#22:1>
So I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility
as a result .. .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#23:1>
It  ' s made me a very happy man ever since . &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#24:1>
<p> He was referring to a game-theoretic situation called &ldquo;
free-rider &rdquo; , which says if you can evade taxes but enjoy social benefits , or
avoid military draft and let others fight in your place , then you should do
so . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#25:1>
<p> Game theory proves the moralistic secondary school teacher wrong: there
are always enough diligent taxpayers and soldiers to sustain the game . </p>

<h> <bold> Queen  ' s English or anyone  ' s - simply be consistent
</bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#29:2>
<p> <bold> LIKE ITS COLONIAL </bold> predecessor , the post-handover
Government has , for the most part , adhered to the British form of English .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#30:2>
But the American influence on SAR bureaucracy-speak is becoming
increasingly visible .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#31:2>
The current crisis in Afghanistan has provided some evidence . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#32:2>
<p> On October 12 , the United Nations Sanctions &obrack;  Afghanistan &cbrack; &obrack;  Arms
Embargoes &cbrack; Regulation was gazetted .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#33:2>
An official press release explained that the move was meant to freeze
the financial assets of &ldquo; Usama &rdquo; bin Laden and any person
connected with him . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#34:2>
<p> Most government agencies elsewhere , including the Chinese and British
foreign ministries , have referred to the leader of al-Qaeda as &ldquo; Osama
&rdquo; in English .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#35:2>
So have the Saudi Arabian authorities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#36:2>
America  ' s FBI is the only notable exception .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#37:2>
The name &ldquo; Usama bin Laden &rdquo; is used on the FBI  ' s list
of most wanted terrorists . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#38:2>
<p> The media statement also referred to territories of Afghanistan under
&ldquo; Taliban &rdquo; control - again an American version of the word .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#39:2>
Our two Hong Kong daily newspapers published in English have both
followed the British style in calling the regime &ldquo; Taleban &rdquo; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#40:2>
<p> Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates: &ldquo; In addition to the Chinese
language , English may also be used as an official language by the executive
authorities , legislature and Judiciary of the HKSAR . &rdquo; The
mini-constitution does not specify which brand of English .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#41:2>
It is only a matter of convention that the administration has
preferred &ldquo; British English &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#42:2>
After all , students are still being told to avoid  &rdquo; Americanisms &rdquo; ,
at least for examination purposes , despite the fact that the spell-check
functions of their word processors are mostly based on the American
vocabulary . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#43:2>
<p> Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was meticulous in adopting British spelling
in his recent Policy Address .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#44:2>
Hence , there were &ldquo; subsidised &rdquo; schools , Family
Service &ldquo; Centres &rdquo; and a &ldquo; labour &rdquo; market . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#45:2>
<p> The term &ldquo; favourable &rdquo; was used six times in his script .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#46:2>
Yet , when the Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority
released its survey findings two months ago , it said comedy was the most
&ldquo; favorable &rdquo; movie genre . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#47:2>
<p> Mr Tung also dwelled on the &ldquo; globalisation &rdquo; trend .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#48:2>
When Secretary for Financial Services Stephen Ip Shu-kwan elaborated
on last year  ' s Policy Address , his text pointed to the challenge presented
by increasing &ldquo; globalization &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#49:2>
In a law seminar , Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie also
mentioned &ldquo; economic globalization &rdquo; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#50:2>
<p> Other examples abound .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#51:2>
Even on sensitive topics like terrorism , officials have not quite
made up their minds as far as their choice of words is concerned .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#52:2>
A government statement on October 17 referred to the &ldquo; Taleban
&rdquo; regime , deviating from the use of &ldquo; Taliban &rdquo; in the
release issued five days earlier on the sanction regulation . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#53:2>
<p> No one in the bureaucracy cares much to standardise the official usage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#54:2>
Even speech writers and information officers are unsure as to whether
there is a style book somewhere in their libraries . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#55:2>
<p> It is incorrect to suggest that one variation of a language is superior
to another .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#56:2>
In terms of simplicity and spread however , the American version of
English definitely has its merits over its British cousin . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#57:2>
<p> It would be unrealistic to expect the authorities to make a major effort
to switch over to &ldquo; American English &rdquo; in the foreseeable future .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#58:2>
But the least authorities can do in the meantime is ensure the civil
service  ' s use of English is consistent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#59:2>
The linguistic environment of the SAR is confusing enough - a little
uniformity on the part of the administration won't hurt . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#60:3>
Performance grading threatens quality </p> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#61:3>
<p> The Education Department has engaged experts from Australia to measure
the performance of secondary schools and there is controversy as to whether
the results should go public . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#62:3>
<p> There is nothing wrong with measuring student ability and comparing
schools .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#63:3>
What  ' s wrong is to put this in an anti-professional framework where
the profession must succumb to top-down or outside pressure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#64:3>
It will be reduced to unthinking operatives of top officials or
managers if the government keeps on imposing measurements from above . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#65:3>
<p> If such measurements are in any way linked to intake competition , as
they will when the results go public , education will go down the drain .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#66:3>
For &ldquo; prestige &rdquo; , schools will drill the students on how to lie
in questionnaires on self-esteem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#67:3>
They will also reduce school life to the little that is measured .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#68:3>
<p> When intake competition is encouraged , schools will give up their
professional ethics to cater to privileged parents ' anti-education demands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#69:3>
They will teach in English students who cannot understand one English
sentence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#70:3>
They will further refuse entry of &ldquo; bad &rdquo; children who
need their education most . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#71:3>
<p> A study by Arizona State University recently found that attempts to
improve US public schools by similar high-stake standardised tests are
failing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#72:3>
The stake is an annual bonus for all teachers in the better schools.
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#73:3>
<p> Important aspects of education that are not tested are being neglected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#74:3>
In order to get higher marks , many schools encourage their
low-achievers to drop out just before the tests . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#75:3>
<p> Our union has advocated high-stake , but professional and
non-standardised , testing to enhance effectiveness of schools .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#76:3>
This would overcome the problems in the US and would not encourage
intake competition . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#77:3>
<p> The key is to let schools form small autonomous &ldquo; quality circles
&rdquo; to compete among themselves , and only among schools within their own
circle . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#78:3>
<p> Each circle sets up its own rules and testing criteria .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#79:3>
Schools scrutinise each other against &ldquo; cheating &rdquo; , for example
, by adjusting the final results for abnormal dropout rates . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#80:3>
<p> The government or funding body , instead of judging the schools , simply
funds the competition by allotting a sum proportional to the number of
teachers in a quality circle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#81:3>
It is up to the teachers in each circle to decide democratically
these crucial points in the &ldquo; education effectiveness competition":
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#82:3>
<p> Whether to join the competition . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#83:3>
<p> With which schools to form a quality circle . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#84:3>
<p> How to measure education effectiveness . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#85:3>
<p> How the award money is distributed among the champion and runners-up .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#86:3>
<p> How the award money is distributed among teachers within a winning school .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#87:3>
<p> It won't be a do-or-die thing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#88:3>
Schools may choose to opt out of the competition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#89:3>
But they may be encouraged to join by a policy that exempts competing
schools from do-or-die centralised measurements or other top-down measures
</p> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#90:3>
<p> Such an &ldquo; education effectiveness competition &rdquo; is dynamic in
nature - it grows in sophistication .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#91:3>
In the first few years , it may cover only Chinese , English and
mathematics .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#92:3>
In the second stage , other easily measured criteria , like more
academic subjects , athletic skills , and aesthetic sense , should be
included .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#93:3>
By the 10th year or so , all-round education should be measured .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#94:3>
<p> Our union has worked out guidelines to measure effectiveness as abstract
as civic education so the pitfall of schools neglecting the more valuable
aspects of education can be avoided .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#95:3>
Although , in the short run , the objective is to establish a
framework of autonomous competition among schools through simpler
measurements , all round education is taken care of in stages . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#96:3>
<p> The trick is &ldquo; non-standardisation &rdquo; of the tests , and
&ldquo; non-interference &rdquo; from the funding body .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#97:3>
In the quality circle system , there need not be uniform standards ,
and yet the incentive to improve is equally strong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#98:3>
On the other hand , the funding body need not invent measuring tools
agreeable to all and covering more and more complicated aspects of education .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#99:3>
<p> They just have to state general principles like &ldquo; one quarter of
the bonus will be withdrawn if , by the fifth year , a quality circle fails
to include measurement of athletic skills as part of the competition
criteria &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#100:3>
The schools in the various circles are expected to comply , or just
keep to their narrower competition and get less bonus . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#101:3>
<p> In Hong Kong , schools compete to attract parents to send their children .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#102:3>
In practice , the popular schools choose the &ldquo; better &rdquo;
students , often of higher socio-economic background , and refuse the
&ldquo; worse" ' ones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#103:3>
This has dire consequences for education . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#104:3>
<p> To counter this unprofessional culture , our scheme keeps intake
competition at arm  ' s length in several ways .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#105:3>
First , results of school comparison may not be publicly disclosed ,
if teachers in a quality circle so wish .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#106:3>
Second , school comparison is only within one voluntary quality
circle of several schools .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#107:3>
We aim at maximising the schools ' effort to improve from their
present standards .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#108:3>
Little can be deduced about a school  ' s standard on a territory-wide
or even district-wide basis . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#109:3>
<p> Third , &ldquo; value-added &rdquo; is an intrinsic feature of the our
competition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#110:3>
Only then can schools with &ldquo; bad &rdquo; intake have a fair
chance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-005#111:3>
But then this is nearly guaranteed by the quality circle system ,
since few schools will join a circle where the rules are unfair to them .
