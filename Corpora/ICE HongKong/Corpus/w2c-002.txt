<bold> Call to tackle chronic deficits </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#2:1>
<bold> From CHRIS YEUNG in Beijing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#3:1>
THE national legislature has urged the central Government to solve
the chronic problem of deficits in three years in order to avoid jeopardising
the economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#4:1>
The Financial and Economic Committee of the National People  ' s
Congress said the increasing deficits of the treasury would seriously
jeopardise the national economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#5:1>
&ldquo; We must have the determination to increase revenue and cut
down expenditure to solve the deficit problem in three years or a slightly
longer period . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#6:1>
The committee  ' s report was based on views expressed by NPC
delegates on Finance Minister Mr Liu Zhongli  ' s provisional 1993 budget
tabled at the plenum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#7:1>
According to Mr Liu  ' s report , the budget deficit for last year
was 23.75 billion yuan &obrack; about HK&dollar;32 billion &cbrack; ,
compared with 21.11 billion yuan for 1991 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#8:1>
Maintaining that the financial situation of the state remained
difficult , the committee proposed a series of measures to help reduce
deficits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#9:1>
The committee urged local authorities to stick to the principle of
a balanced budget , adding &ldquo; no deficits should occur in the process of
implementation &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#10:1>
The State Council should take effective measures to strictly
control the budget implementation and try to reduce the deficit earlier than
forecasted , it said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#11:1>
The committee called on the relevant departments under the State
Council to accelerate the drafting of laws concerning taxation and budgets .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#12:1>
A set of laws on budgets should be tabled to the NPC Standing
Committee for study this year so it could be forwarded for approval at next
year  ' s plenary session . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#13:1>
The committee said the Government should take measures to ensure
laws on taxation were strictly enforced and publicised so the public was
aware of the significance of their duties to pay tax . </p> </I>

<bold> Trade body to be trouble-shooter </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#15:2>
THE newly-established State Economic and Trade Commission will
act as a trouble-shooter in the development of China  ' s market economy ,
according to its chairman , Mr Wang Zhongyu . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#16:2>
Mr Wang said the 300-strong commission would look into specific
problems arising in the course of the development of the socialist market
economy and give remedies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#17:2>
Top priority of his ministerial-level commission is to study
problems incurred by changes to the public ownership system and the operation
of state-owned enterprises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#18:2>
Mr Wang indicated that matters such as the long-term and
macro-level plan of the economy remained under the jurisdiction of the State
Planning Commission . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#19:2>
Mr Wang is one of 22 new faces in the 41 ministries to be named
by the Prime Minister , Mr Li Peng , at the NPC today . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#20:2>
Meanwhile , the head of the newly-formed economic ministry in
charge of domestic trade said the restructuring plan of the State Council
would boost the development of a market economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#21:2>
Mr Zhang Haorao , who will head the Ministry of Internal Trade
&dash; a merger of the former Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of
Commodities &dash; said , under the old system , most goods were produced
under a quota system set by the Government regardless of the market situation .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#22:2>
This had resulted in the stock-piling of goods and an enormous
waste of resources . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#23:2>
Mr Zhang said his new ministry would seek a balance between the
production of goods and market demand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#24:2>
Although the Government would try to rely more on domestic
supplies , he said foreign supplies and technology were needed to upgrade
China  ' s industry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#25:2>
The new minister said his office would work closely with the
Ministry of Foreign Economic and Trade Co-operation , which will be headed by
noted trade negotiator Ms Wu Yi . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#26:2>
Mr Zhang said : &ldquo; It might be difficult to clearly
delineate domestic and external trade .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#27:2>
Some foreign enterprises have also engaged in domestic trade .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#28:2>
The contrary is also true . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#29:2>
He said they would strive for a national unified market and
remove regional trade barriers , but added it might take time to combat
regional protectionism . </p> &dash; <h>

<bold> Tamar on defence talks agenda </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#32:3>
<bold> By CHRIS YEUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#33:3>
TALKS which resume next week between Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group defence experts are unlikely to settle quickly the row over the
relocation of the HMS Tamar naval base , sources said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#34:3>
In another sign of Sino-British co-operation on the 1997 handover
, the two governments announced yesterday that the experts &rsquo; group on
defence and public order will meet from Tuesday to Thursday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#35:3>
Led by Mr Luo Jiahuan , the mainland team will include members
from the Hongkong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council and senior
officials from the Ministry of Defence and People  ' s Liberation Army &obrack;
PLA &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#36:3>
The British team will be led by Mr Alan Paul . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#37:3>
Sources said the Chinese side would raise the issue of the
removal of the Tamar military site . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#38:3>
China has attacked the relocation of the base to Stonecutters
Island , saying it opposed any &ldquo; unilateral &rdquo; disposal of
military lands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#39:3>
A source said : &ldquo; In previous talks the Chinese side wanted
to have certain facilities but the other side refused .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#40:3>
The process of bargaining is dynamic and keeps changing .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#41:3>
It will take time for two sides to reach a full accord . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#42:3>
The source ruled out the possibility that the warming of ties
between London and Beijing would help the sides reach an early deal over
defence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#43:3>
&ldquo; We should not be too optimistic .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#44:3>
The two sides agreed to sit down and talk .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#45:3>
The problems in the past are still the same .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#46:3>
It marks the normalisation of contacts at most . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#47:3>
In addition to the removal of the Tamar base , the Chinese side
is angry that Britain has taken no concrete steps to build a new naval base
for the Chinese garrison on Stonecutters Island . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#48:3>
It is understood that China expects the naval base to be
comparable in scale with the Tamar site on the Wan Chai waterfront . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#49:3>
Beijing will also press the British team to hand over the Prince
of Wales Building , the present headquarters of the British garrison , to
Chinese troops after 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#50:3>
It is understood Britain prefers the building be turned into
offices , arguing that it was not important to the Chinese garrison . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#51:3>
Britain also believes it is too politically sensitive to have PLA
headquarters near Hongkong  ' s commercial centre . </p> </I>

<bold> From CHRIS YEUNG in Beijing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#54:4>
LEFTISTS suffered a setback during the elections to China  ' s main
united front body yesterday , when most elected Hongkong deputies outnumbered
the votes of senior party leader Mr Li Ruihuan , who was elected as its
chairman . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#55:4>
Five leftists and conservative ideologues received the lowest
count of votes among the 315 nominees named by the ruling Chinese Communist
Party to sit on the Standing Committee of the Chinese People  ' s Political
Consultative Conference &obrack; CPPCC &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#56:4>
Out of the 1,863 valid votes , only 1,412 supported State Council
spokesman Mr Yuan Mu &dash; dubbed &ldquo; Yuan 23 &rdquo; for his insistence
that only 23 people died in the June 4 suppression &dash; in his bid for a
seat on the standing committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#57:4>
Mr Yuan and the other 314 nominees , however , were all elected
by majority to the standing committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#58:4>
Under the so-called &ldquo; same-candidate election &rdquo; in
China , members are given only one choice for every seat , but can abstain
from voting to show their disapproval . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#59:4>
Almost all the nominees received more than 1,800 votes and the
list is expected to be rubber-stamped in its entirety . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#60:4>
Mr Li , a Politburo Standing Committee member and the only
nominee for the post of chairman on the ballot paper , received 1,837 votes .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#61:4>
Opposing the candidacy of Mr Li , six of the 1,865 delegates who
attended yesterday  ' s sessions wrote their own candidates for the CPPCC top
post on the ballots . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#62:4>
Five named the former Guangdong Governor , Mr Ye Xuanping and one
chose Mr Yang Rudai , a former party secretary of Sichuan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#63:4>
Both Mr Ye and Mr Yang were nominated as vice-chairmen and given
the delegates &rsquo; approval . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#64:4>
Apart from Mr Yuan , four others generally seen as conservatives
also met strong disapproval from the deputies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#65:4>
A former vice-chairman of the State Education Commission , Mr He
Dongchang , got 1,483 votes while the former director of the People  ' s Daily
, Mr Gao Di received 1,524 votes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#66:4>
A total of only 1,602 deputies endorsed the nomination of former
vice-minister of the Propaganda Department , Mr Xu Weicheng while another
1,616 went to Mr He Jingzhi , former minister of culture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#67:4>
Meanwhile , two Hongkong nominees , Dr Ann Tse-kai and Mr Henry
Fok Ying-tung received 1,853 and 1,832 votes respectively to serve as
vice-chairmen of the CPPCC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#68:4>
Macau businessman , Mr Ma Man-kei was also elected as one of the
25 vice-chairmen of the CPPCC . </p> </I>

<bold> Order issued to stay away from rallies </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#70:5>
<bold> By CHRIS YEUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#71:5>
THE Communist Party has ordered all organisations and individuals
to stay away from rallies and other events which may be staged to commemorate
the fourth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#72:5>
Chinese sources said the party Central Committee last week issued
a directive to all units , including schools and the media , on precautions
they must take in the run-up to the June 4 anniversary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#73:5>
The directive said &ldquo; reactionary elements &rdquo; had shown
signs of a revival . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#74:5>
It claimed that these unspecified elements had attempted to
sabotage economic reform as well as the stability of the country . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#75:5>
&ldquo; Party members , workers and students are asked not to
take to the streets no matter what happens, &rdquo; a source said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#76:5>
The directive came less than a fortnight after the party had
issued a document to colleges and high schools , warning against the
emergence of signs of dissent on campus since early last month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#77:5>
The school authorities were asked to take &ldquo; resolute and
tough &rdquo; measures to clamp down on such activities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#78:5>
Signs of the revival of student unrest emerged at Beijing
University last month when a group of student activists planned to stage a
&ldquo; walkabout &rdquo; at the end of a candlelight rock'n'roll concert .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#79:5>
Police , who knew of the plan in advance , detained three
students in the middle of the concert .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#80:5>
They were freed after 24 hours of questioning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#81:5>
The authorities were also targeting attempts by dissidents taking
advantage of Beijing  ' s bid to host the 2000 Olympics to put pressure on the
Government for greater democracy and improvements in human rights . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#82:5>
A source said the jailed &ldquo; black hand &rdquo; dissident ,
Wang Juntao , would begin an indefinite hunger strike on Friday to press for
his release on medical parole . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#83:5>
Now in hospital , Mr Wang is said to have heart and liver
problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#84:5>
But the source said it was unlikely there would be strong mass
protests to mark the June 4 anniversary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#85:5>
&ldquo; Yes , there are still some active elements among students
and intellectuals who want to do something this year .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#86:5>
But it is not likely that they will get strong support, &rdquo; he
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#87:5>
&ldquo; The mainstream view among intellectuals is that radical
political protests will not do the country any good . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#88:5>
&ldquo; Furthermore , political unrest will be used as an excuse
for the conservatives to roll back reforms . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#89:5>
Security checks in leading universities , such as the Beijing
University and the People  ' s University , have noticeably increased in the
past few weeks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#90:5>
More regular and plain-clothes police have been deployed in the
college district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#91:5>
The source said : &ldquo; June 4 has become a &lsquo; complex
&rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#92:5>
They will now raise precautions every year to prevent unrest .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#93:5>
This year is more important because of the 2000 Olympics bid .

<bold> Vow to continue economic reform </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#95:6>
<bold> By CHRIS YEUNG in Shijiazhuang , Hebei </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#96:6>
CHINA will not put a brake on its reform drive despite signs of
the economy overheating , according to the party chief of Hebei province ,
Cheng Weigao . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#97:6>
&ldquo; The solution still lies with the improvement in
macro-level supervision of the economy .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#98:6>
The ultimate goal is to maintain the present momentum of reforms,
&rdquo; he said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#99:6>
Mr Cheng , the party boss of the province closest to Beijing , is
optimistic that signs of overheating will not jeopardise the overall economy .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#100:6>
&ldquo; The economy is good and normal, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#101:6>
He maintained that the province and the party centre agreed on
the issue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#102:6>
&ldquo; We are determined not to have any U-turn of policy in
the future .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#103:6>
Therefore , the economic reform drive will not abruptly halt,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#104:6>
He pointed out that problems arising in the course of reforms
could only be solved by intensifying reforms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#105:6>
For instance , he said the shortage of funds should be solved by
improving the management of the monetary system and macro-level supervision
as well as investment on fixed assets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#106:6>
The lack of funds made it imperative for the province to open
its doors wider to foreign investors , Mr Cheng said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#107:6>
Deputy Governor of the province , Chen Liyou , said : &ldquo;
The problems with the economy have not reached the crisis level that
endangers the whole economy or leads to any serious imbalance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#108:6>
&ldquo; The fact that the party centre and the provinces have
been alert about the issue shows that we are sober-minded and objective .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#109:6>
We are confident that the economy remains sound, &rdquo; said Mr
Chen , who is in charge of economic matters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#110:6>
Hebei is to hold a large-scale trade fair in Hongkong next month
to help bridge its gap with the outside world . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#111:6>
Repeating statements made by state leaders that the region
surrounding the Bay of Bohai will be another major area for reform in the
next decade , Mr Cheng is confident that the centre of foreign investments
will gradually shift northwards from the south coast . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#112:6>
&ldquo; I  ' ve told our cadres that does not necessarily mean
that funds will flow into Hebei .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#113:6>
The most important thing is still the improvement in our environment
for investment . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#114:6>
Mr Cheng said he was convinced the province would become an
attraction for investors because of its geographical location , endowment of
natural resources , the abundant supply of expertise as well as its
preferential policies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#115:6>
More importantly , Mr Cheng said Hebei would benefit from the
success of the two municipal cities &dash; Beijing and Tianjin &dash; which
lie within the province geographically but are separated from it under China  ' s
administrative system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#116:6>
Mr Cheng said : &ldquo; We want to play down our political
separation &obrack; between the province and the two municipalities &cbrack;
and emphasise our economic links . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#117:6>
&ldquo; Through the links with Beijing , we can attract more
investors and reach the world .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#118:6>
We will meet soon to map our strategy in bridging the links between
the two . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#119:6>
Beijing will also benefit from the increased links with the
region , he said . </p> </I>

ACTRESS Ms Huang Wanqiu , better known as Liu Sanjie , has put a
legend rooted in scenic Guilin into the service of an enterprise helping to
promote Chinese culture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#123:7>
Under the banner of the Guilin Star Enterprise &obrack; Group
&cbrack; Company , Ms Huang , who has played the role of Sanjie &obrack;
literally &ldquo; third elder sister &rdquo; &cbrack; in the Chinese folk
legend on the stage , is now leading a team of 1,000 staff and a conglomerate
with assets of more than 64 million yuan &obrack; HK&dollar;86.2 million
&cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#124:7>
The company also plans to set up a joint venture with a Hongkong
businessman to invest HK&dollar;150 million in the construction of buildings
in the Guangxi provincial capital . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#125:7>
Liu Sanjie , the daughter of a fishing family from the Li River
in Guilin , is now the name of a canned food shop , an artists group and
investment company , an advertising company , a travel agency , video and
music company , a shopping mall . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#126:7>
Dating back centuries , the legendary Sanjie , known for her wit
and bravery , is a symbol of the masses who resisted feudalism and
suppression by landlords . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#127:7>
The idea of setting up an enterprise under the name of Liu
Sanjie was mooted last year when Ms Huang was heading a group to perform the
opera story in Malaysia and Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#128:7>
&ldquo; I was surprised by the warm response from the audience ,
particularly the Chinese ... I think that was a chance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#129:7>
&ldquo; We cannot just rely on the river and the stone
landscapes &obrack; along the Li River &cbrack; to attract tourists .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#130:7>
We have to promote our distinct culture to combine with the scenic
attractions . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#131:7>
The 49-year-old actress believes that there is also a role for
artists to play in propagating senior leader Mr Deng Xiaoping line of
socialist economic development while promoting Chinese culture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#132:7>
Part of the revenue generated by the enterprise will go to
funding the Liu Sanjie Opera Group , which is to promote the traditional
culture of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#133:7>
Ms Huang said : &ldquo; Culture and arts groups have faced
enormous financial difficulties .

<ICE-HK:W2C-002#134:7>
As television , videos and satellite television became more popular
, fewer people now go to watch traditional arts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-002#135:7>
&ldquo; Although the Government still gives wages to many
artists , we want to have greater autonomy in managing our finances, &rdquo;
she said . </p> </I>
