<h> <ul> INTRODUCTION : &obrack; CALVINISM , CAPITALISM &cbrack; </ul>
</h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#2:1>
<p> Max Weber theorized that Calvinism fostered the Protestant ethic of hard
work and that Protestantism was an important influence on the development of
Capitalism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#3:1>
Calvinism was the faith which the political and cultural struggles of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were fought in most highly developed
countries such as the Netherlands , England , and France . <fnr> &obrack; 1
&cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#4:1>
According to An Encyclopedia of religion , Calvinism is <quote>
&ldquo; that system of theology and church organization and practice with
grew out of the work of John Calvin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#5:1>
Theologically , it is marked by the supreme role of Scripture in
revelation , the interpretation of the same being under the guidance of the
Holy spirit . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack; 2 &cbrack; </fnr> It shows that
a solid base for ethics is established in the concept that the ability to
live the Christian Law is evidence of probable election .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#6:1>
Calvinism is rooted in the concept of predestination , which holds
that before they are born , certain people are selected for heaven and others
for hell .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#7:1>
Nothing anyone does in this world can change this .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#8:1>
&obrack; 3 &cbrack; The Calvinists consequently were anxious to find
out whether they were among those chosen for salvation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#9:1>
Worldly success , especially the financial success that grew out of
strict discipline , hard work and self-control , was seen as proof that a
person was among the select few .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#10:1>
&obrack; 4 &cbrack; It was Weber  ' s view that Capitalism really
blossomed only with the advent of Calvinism . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#11:1>
<p> Then , simply put , Weber defines the spirit of Capitalism is that :

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#12:1>
<X> <quote> &ldquo; in conformity with the Old Testament . . .
asceticism looked upon the pursuit of wealth as an end in itself as highly
reprehensible , but the attainment of it as a fruit of labour in a calling
was a sign of God  ' s blessing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#X13:1>
And even more important : the religious valuation of restless ,
continuous , systemic work in a worldly calling , as the highest means to
asceticism , and at the same time the sure stand most evident proof of
rebirth and genuine faith , must have been the most powerful conceivable
lever for the expansion of that attitude toward life . &rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#X14:1>
&obrack; Max Weber , 1985 : 172 &cbrack; <fnr> &obrack; 5 &cbrack;
</fnr> </X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#15:1>
<p> It means that the spirit of Capitalism is a set of dispositions or
motives encouraging an ascetic life style as an end in self . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#16:1>
<h> <ul> THE RELATION BETWEEN PROTESTANTISM AND CAPITALISM </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#17:1>
<p> In Weber  ' s view , Protestantism , especially in its Calvinistic forms ,
was bound directly to the rise of modern Capitalism . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#18:1>
<p> The concept of &ldquo; calling &rdquo; is the central link for Weber
between the religious Protestant ethic and the spirit of Capitalism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#19:1>
In his descriptions of Calvinism , Weber emphasizes the belief in
predestination .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#20:1>
Since God is omnipotent , he must have determined the whole pattern
of creation for eternity . <fnr> &obrack; 6 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#21:1>
The belief in predestination applied to personal salvation became
crucial for the development of a capitalist spirit &longdash; by increasing
the glory of God through a life of systematic self-control and to do the God
will is man  ' s first duty .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#22:1>
It states that Weber seeks to demonstrate that the Protestant ethic
with its emphasis on a &ldquo; calling &rdquo; work for the glorification of
God , and opposition to certain worldly ways served as an important spur to
the development of Capitalism . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#23:1>
<p> It was for religious motives that the puritans turned with full force
against the relaxed enjoyment of life and the pursuit of pleasure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#24:1>
<quote> &ldquo; If God shows one of this elect a chance of profit he
must do it with purpose . &rdquo; </quote> said Richard Baxter . <fnr>
&obrack; 7 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#25:1>
Yet the pursuit of profit combined with a denial of the pleasure of
conspicuous consumption produced an economic spirit .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#26:1>
This had the effect of freeing the acquisition of goods from
traditionalistic ethics &longdash; it was no longer sinful or dubious
morality , to make a profit in trade .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#27:1>
The result of these injunctions , then , was to promote the constant
accumulation of capital through an ascetic compulsion to save .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#28:1>
Thus , religious asceticism remodeled the world and gave material
goods their inexorable power in history . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#29:1>
<p> In tracing the affinity between the bourgeois life pattern and certain
components of the religious stylization of life , Weber emphasized the
gradual genesis of a psychological habit which enabled men to meet the
requirements of early modern Capitalism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#30:1>
That is , the Protestants went about his business with sturdy
confidence that Providence purposely enabled him to prosper for God  ' s glory .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#31:1>
On the other hand , the hand-worker or laborer , with his willingness
to work , derived his sense of a religious state of grace from his
conscientiousness in his calling .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#32:1>
Moreover , because of the abomination of hoarding accumulated in the
exercise of a calling was turned back into the business enterprise .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#33:1>
Its significance for the development of capitalism is obvious .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#34:1>
That is , Protestantism <-> lead </-> <+> led </+> to methodical
rationalization of activity and the consequent encouragement of capitalist
behavior and attitudes . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#35:1>
<h> <ul> Criticism on Weber  ' s thesis </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#36:1>
<p> Weber adjudged the influence of Protestantism on Capitalism , his
analysis has been criticized from many standpoints . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#37:1>
<p> Felix Rachfahl , raised several issues that were to recur in subsequence
debates .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#38:1>
First , he argued , the capitalistic dichotomy have been
overstretched .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#39:1>
Capitalism did not require Calvin or the Reformation and Weber
ignored more general motivations like power , honour , security that gave
much greater impetus to capitalist behaviour than did religion . <fnr>
&obrack; 8 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#40:1>
Indeed for Rachfahl , religion influence can be absorbed into the
effect of wider social relations .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#41:1>
I also consider Capitalism emerged as the cumulative result of social
, political , economic and religious forces .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#42:1>
Secondly , <quote> &ldquo; inner-worldly asceticism was not peculiar
to Protestantism . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack; 9 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#43:1>
In fact , it was common to Catholic laity and was actually rejected
by many Calvinists .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#44:1>
Thirdly , he provided some specific examples :

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#45:1>
Dutch capitalism had little to do with Protestant sects , while in
the USA in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , many people practiced
worldly <-> ascetism </-> <+> asceticism </+> but lived in agrarian , not
capitalist economy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#46:1>
In England Capitalism antedated Protestantism . <fnr> &obrack; 10
&cbrack; </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#47:1>
<p> Tawney <-> accursed </-> <+> <?> accused </?> </+> Weber  ' s thesis appear
to be one-sided and over strained .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#48:1>
He says , <quote> &ldquo; Weber seems to explain by reference to
moral and intellectual influences developments which-have their principal
explanation in another region altogether . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> &obrack; 11
&cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#49:1>
Capitalism existed in Fifteenth-century Venice and Florence , which
were Catholic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#50:1>
The subsequent development of Capitalism in Holland and England in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was due <quote> to &ldquo;
discoveries and the results that followed from them . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr>
&obrack; 12 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#51:1>
From the above argument , I guess the meaning of that it is
artificial to talk as though capitalist enterprises could not appear until
religious changes had produced a capitalist spirit . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#52:1>
<p> Robertson argues that both Protestantism and Catholicism were ambiguous
regarding Capitalism .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#53:1>
See claim that <quote> &ldquo; the spirit of Capitalism was not the
offspring of Puritanism , but the latter was a tonic for it . &rdquo;
</quote> <fnr> &obrack; 13 &cbrack; </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#54:1>
<p> In Sombart view , the human instinct compels people to collect money ,
especially gold . <fnr> &obrack; 14 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#55:1>
From this , the capitalistic spirit does not shape the economic
activities .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#56:1>
Other scholars like Walker and Borkenau , Troeltsch also leveled
criticisms against Weber  ' s thesis . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#57:1>
<p> In the following , I would bring out some questions and give criticisms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#58:1>
Capitalism , appeared only in the West , during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#59:1>
Yet China , India , had at certain period conditions that might have
made capitalist development possible .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#60:1>
What conditions then were specific to the West ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#61:1>
What existed there and not elsewhere , that can account for
capitalist development ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#62:1>
I would just as well argue a reverse , that the social and economic
changes le to the rise of industrialism and Capitalism stimulated the
emergent of the new Protestantism .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#64:1>
<p> Weber limited his data to an ideal type of the spirit of Capitalism and
excluded all other direct economic and social factors that could be held
responsible for the growth in capitalist mentality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#65:1>
Did Weber deny the influence of trade , money , technology ,
political centralization , legal rationalization , secularism , luxury and
many other elements that had been singly and severally advanced to explain
the rise of Capitalism in the West ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#66:1>
He did not .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#67:1>
All of these , to a great extent , had been essential . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#68:1>
<p> While there is readiness to accept the congruity between Calvinism and
Capitalism , I would question that Calvinism emerged later than Capitalism where
the latter became decisively power .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#70:1>
From this , did Calvinism regard as the subsequent development of
Capitalism ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#71:1>
<p> Weber  ' s employment of the ideal-type method leads to various distortion
, such as his overemphasis the concepts of vocation and predestination .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#72:1>
The whole thesis appears suffused by a tendency to idealization ,
with a comparative neglect of secular factors , economic , political and
technological .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#73:1>
In fact , he was charged with overemphasis on the religious or
ideological factor . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#74:1>
<p> I agree that although religious belief did indeed affect economic
behaviour , the tent of Protestantism and Capitalism tended to support each
other . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#75:1>
<p> When I examine some religious books , I find that Calvinist doctrines
were not so uniform as pictured them , nor was the work ethic confine to the
Protestant value system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#76:1>
I whole-heartedly support Tawney  ' s argument .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#77:1>
That is <quote> &ldquo; Protestantism was not a unified movement ,
and different social doctrines were fought out within it . &rdquo; </quote>
<fnr> &obrack; 15 &cbrack; </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#78:1>
Thus , in Puritanism an element which was revolutionary ,
Collectivism which grasped an iron discipline , and individualism which got
rid of the savorless of human ordinances .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#79:1>
From this view , Weber oversimplified the Protestantism . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#80:1>
<p> Lastly , I allege that Weber  ' s thesis neglected the time coefficient .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#81:1>
Assume that , for instance , Weber  ' s interpretation of Calvinist
theology was correct and this would result in activism , dynamism , industry
etc . , the question still remained since these influence did not begin to
exert significant effect only after capitalism had already reached dominance
position . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#82:1>
<h> <ul> Conclusion : </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#83:1>
<p> In conclusion , Weber  ' s thesis became a dispute because it posed
questions in a challenged and original way .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#84:1>
Nevertheless , his first contribution to a systematic sociology of
religion was sound in intention .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#85:1>
Since Weber  ' s essay on the Protestant Ethic is an introduction to
domain of sociology of religion which it serves stake out .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#86:1>
It pave the way for the formulation of an adequate social theory of
religion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#87:1>
It also stimulates generation of researchers in this new disciple and
finally , he is regarded as the precursor of functional analysis in culture
history . </p> </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#88:2>
<p> Justice , in another word , fairness , is the common target which all
jurisdiction suppose to achieve .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#89:2>
Lord Denning once defined justice as <quote> &ldquo; what the
right-minded members of the community - those who have the right spirit
within them - believe to be fair . &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> 1 </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#90:2>
<footnote> Lord Denning , The Road to justice , p . 4 </footnote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#91:2>
Since justice has to be believed by the community , the ideal of
justice is that justice must not only be done , but also to be believed by
the community , the ideal of justice is that justice must not only be done ,
but also to be seen . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#92:2>
<p> In Hong Kong , over 90&percent; of criminal proceedings are dealt with by the
Magistrates  '  Courts .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#93:2>
It is our concern in this piece of writing to see how far the ideal
of justice being achieved or departed in the Magistrates  '  courts .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#94:2>
We may analyze the issue by looking at the legal principles the
Magistrates  '  courts adopt and , under these principles , how the Magistrates  ' 
function and some special features which indicate how successful the ideal of
justice being achieved . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#95:2>
<h> <bold> <ul> Independence of Judiciary </ul> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#96:2>
<p> One very important principle of achieving justice is Independence of
Judiciary .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#97:2>
Under this principle , the Magistrate should be dependent on no man ,
even the government , to ensure that the accused be fairly tried .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#98:2>
However , under the present system , Magistrates are employed by
contract with the Government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#99:2>
The Government can terminate the contract by a three months notice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#100:2>
It is arguable that in such case , justice is not being seen to be
done since the Magistrate is not absolutely or obviously independent .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#101:2>
Even the Magistrate may be actually very just and impartial , but it
cannot be seen by the public . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#102:2>
<h> <bold> <ul> <-> Impartially </-> <+> Impartiality </+> of
Magistrates </ul> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#103:2>
<p> Magistrates must have no self interest in any case he has to try .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#104:2>
He must be impartial .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#105:2>
So the Magistrate should follow decided cases and give similar
judgement to similar cases .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#106:2>
And he is required to give reason of his decision in order to show
his impartiality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#107:2>
Also , he should have no bias on neither party .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#108:2>
We can observe that in the Magistrates  '  Court the Chief Magistrate
in court No . 1 will not try the case even though he may be just , since he
has got the first impression of the case and know about the background of the
accused in the first appearance in court .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#109:2>
The case should be tried by another judge who will have no bias and
be seen to have no bias to the accused .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#110:2>
Moreover , the Magistrate who try the case will only know about the
criminal record of the accused before giving sentences .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#111:2>
This is to ensure that no injustice will be done based on the past
record of the accused . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#112:2>
<p> Justice seemed being done based on the above nature of the Magistrate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#113:2>
However , it seems to me questionable that the great responsibility
of putting an accused into the jail for two years by the impression and
understanding of one fallible human being .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#114:2>
The Magistrate himself may be just but the heavy workload and
similar cases tried everyday may make him fell routine and bored .

<ICE-HK:W1A-003#115:2>
He then may not be very careful in hearing the case and thus justice
may not be actually done . </p> </I>
