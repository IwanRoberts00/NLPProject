<ICE-HK:S2A-052#1:1:A>
Alright good afternoon <,> uh welcome to Town Gas Centre to our
cooking class

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#2:1:A>
Oh <,,> do you have the <,,> uh who who who were here last time <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#3:1:A>
Only two of you

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#4:1:A>
You are all here new <,> so you are entitled to two <,>
demonstration two courses <,> one this time <,> and another will be next next
month <,> so uhm <,> you come again

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#5:1:A>
Uh every time you learn three dishes and the three dishes is Chinese
food in Chinese cooking only that uh <,> written in English alright so you
know exactly what they are

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#6:1:A>
And you find that as we choose the dishes we choose different
methods of cooking as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#7:1:A>
Well let  ' s check over the <,> recipes see whether you have the same
as I do

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#8:1:A>
One is called the fried beef with oyster sauce

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#9:1:A>
It  ' s a very common one <,> so actually what we want to show you is
<,> in Chinese cooking home style cooking it  ' s always vegetable with meat
<,> alright so today we choose beef <,> very common uh kind of meat that we
have at home and then we have vegetables

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#10:1:A>
And vegetables now in the season is the <indig> choi sum </indig>
so learn a bit of the Cantonese <indig> choi sum </indig> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#11:1:A>
So beef and <.> vege </.> to cook together and we do the work of
stir frying so show you stir fry in Cantonese they call <indig> chau </indig>
<,> alright stir fry

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#12:1:A>
So another one that we  ' re going to do is stewed spare ribs with
potatoes alright <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#13:1:A>
So this one again is pork

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#14:1:A>
Pork again is a very common meat we use at home and in stewing

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#15:1:A>
Stewing today I show you <,> is uhm I  ' ll be using the earthenware
pot <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#16:1:A>
So earthenware pot <?> it  ' s a </?> local Chinese one you can also
have the Japanese one nicer one Taiwanese one as well same you do it the same

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#17:1:A>
<?> That  ' s </?> stewed pork right so we  ' re going to show you <,>
stewing in here

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#18:1:A>
And then another one I  ' m going to show you is steaming <,> right
steaming the Chinese way steam fish <unc> 2-words </unc> <unc>
2-words </unc> is called <indig> waan yu </indig> so I show you later on
how they look like <,> where can get it in the market right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#19:1:A>
So I  ' ll be doing the beef and then I  ' ll be doing the stew spare
ribs and the last one I  ' ll be doing is steaming of fish the steaming of the
fish takes only about <,> eight minutes right so very quick

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#20:1:A>
So let  ' s start with the <unc> several-words </unc> now

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#21:1:A>
Uh take a look at the fried beef with oyster sauce <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#22:1:A>
Now fried beef with oyster sauce uh <,> as you find in the recipe
we have five ounces of the beef fillet

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#23:1:A>
Now actually you can buy beef fillet from the local market <,> from
the supermarket but normally when we go to the local market we don't call the
beef fillet we don't buy <indig> ngau nau </indig> that very often the two
Chinese character there is called <indig> ngau nau </indig> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#24:1:A>
<indig> ngau nau </indig> is really the fillet <,> one long piece
but normally we buy <indig> ngau yuk </indig> <,> right the meat and then we
tell them is <indig> chau </indig> stir frying alright so because stir frying
<,> need some tender cut so if you show them that we need it to stir fry they
will give you the cut of beef that is tender if you don't tell them they  ' ll
give you just any other cut <,> that it will be you will be in trouble
alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#25:1:A>
So when you go to the local market either buy <indig> ngau nau
</indig> <,> or you buy <,> <indig> ngau yuk </indig> for stir frying <indig>
chau </indig> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#26:1:A>
So here it <,> here it is <,> so roughly about five ounces <,> uhm
<,> I think if you go to the local market it takes about eight to ten dollars
<,> for something about that size right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#27:1:A>
So uh for family of four or even about five it should be enough
because apart from the meat itself you also got <.> veges </.> and also we
got two main three other dishes to go with rice right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#28:1:A>
So here you look at it that is the beef how are we going to cut the
beef

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#29:1:A>
Some people are lazy you ask <,> the butcher that oh you help me to
cut the beef

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#30:1:A>
Sometimes they do it for you sometimes they don't so you have to
learn right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#31:1:A>
But when <?> people </?> get a piece of beef you find that there
are <unc> 1-word </unc> there  ' re lines right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#32:1:A>
When you see the lines even with such a small piece I can see the
line running that way <,> and that means I  ' m going to cut across <,> if you
cut along it it  ' ll be tough because you don't cut up the fibers right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#33:1:A>
So the first thing to do is to turn the piece of meat and see how
the line goes when you see the line goes that way that means I  ' m going to
cut it down cutting across the <unc> 1-word </unc> alright so cut
across the <unc> 1-word </unc> and then I  ' m going to marinate

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#34:1:A>
So one should know the where the <unc> 1-word </unc> lines
the second thing is I  ' m going to cut

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#35:1:A>
Now this is a chopper that we use at home may be it looks a little
scary to start off with but once you get used to it it  ' s a very very good
one

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#36:1:A>
I use it for slicing I use it for chopping I use it for shredding
alright so <.> ho </.> this is how you  ' re going to hold it

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#37:1:A>
When you hold the chopper don't hold it like you are <unc>
several-words </unc> <,> it  ' s very tiring here because <unc> 2-words
</unc> heavy

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#38:1:A>
So what we normally do is to <,> grip the handle <,> with the <.>
thre </.> three fingers and then the two fingers standing in the position of
the blade

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#39:1:A>
As we cut <,> right this is more or less the the the the area that
we  ' re going to cut seldom we cut on the top part <,> because away from here
<,> you don't cut the beef nice <?> nicely </?> right so that is the way
where we to cut

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#40:1:A>
Now if you are going to slice the beef <,> thin beef right that is
the way to do it <,> then you are going to use it for stir frying not too
thick <,> not too thin <,> something about that size alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#41:1:A>
So slice up all the five ounces of beef <,> roughly about eight to
ten dollars of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#42:1:A>
And then the next thing you are going to do to ensure that you got
nice tender beef apart from buying the right cut you are going to add in the
seasoning

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#43:1:A>
And you notice the seasoning there <,> I  ' ve written down all of
the five ounces of beef we start with something called the cooking soda so as
I finish up with my beef I  ' m going to show you <,> how I  ' m going to
marinate them

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#44:1:A>
So once you come to the very end sometime the beef doesn't look
very thick <,> when you slice it it doesn't look like a <.> ver </.> very
neat piece

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#45:1:A>
So what we  ' re going to do we will <,> do a cut what we call the
butterfly cut

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#46:1:A>
May be from the <,> camera alright you might see me cutting down a
piece <,> don't cut through <,> right this is one wing of the butterfly and
then we cut another piece down right through it and opening it out <,,> you
got a much larger surface that is what we call the butterfly cut

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#47:1:A>
To cut off one wing of the butterfly <,> and then another wing and
then you flat it

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#48:1:A>
This is mostly done when you come to the end piece of the beef <.>
wher </.> when you cut it  ' s not a nice <.> me </.> decent meat pieces
alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#49:1:A>
So here I  ' m going to slice it off <,> everything right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#50:1:A>
So once you got all the five ounces of meat ready <,> alright you
are going to add in the <,> seasoning <,> okay here <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#51:1:A>
So that  ' s supposed to be the seasoning for five ounces now you
notice that uh <?> we got </?> quite a number of you here I  '  m going to do
double <,> so everybody can taste <unc> 1-word </unc> later on

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#52:1:A>
So when you got five ounces <,> follow exactly as in the recipe

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#53:1:A>
Starting with a quarter teaspoon of <,> you can call it the
<unc> 1-word </unc> soda I purposely <,> reserve this <unc>
1-word </unc> though it looks a little messy right because <unc>
several-words </unc> soda you can call it cooking soda you can call it
baking soda it also used for baking you can call it <unc> 1-word
</unc> soda right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#54:1:A>
And then what we  ' re going to add in <,> is if we have five ounces
you are going to add in a quarter <,> level teaspoon you can add less but not
more than that otherwise it taste a little funny right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#55:1:A>
So when I add to my meat there I don't sprinkle <,> you find me
whenever I add soda I measure <,> level <,> even <,> less than what I mean is
alright put it by the side and the next thing I  ' m going to add in <X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#X56:1:A>
Hello take your place </X>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#57:1:A>
And the next thing I  ' m going to add in is I  ' m going to add in <,>
water so you notice the seasoning column I have one tablespoon of water

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#58:1:A>
I  ' m going to add it right in there <,> mixing with the soda <,> as
much as I can until they  ' re well <unc> 1-word </unc> or dissolved
<,> alright because if you sprinkle the <?> quantity </?> of the soda on the
top of the beef because the soda will <,> someway absorbed <,> some inside
would not so you find some may be tender <,> some may be not

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#59:1:A>
Those who absorb too much will taste a little bitter so the best
thing to do is to dissolve it as much <,> in the water and then <unc>
2-words </unc> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#60:1:A>
One should mix it <,> take a look at the the water that <,> all the
water <,> disappear <,> right I have two tablespoon because I got double
quantity but you don't find a single drop draining out

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#61:1:A>
What happen to it it is absorbed inside the beef and it absorbed in
soda evenly as well

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#62:1:A>
So whenever you use soda you do it my way <,> which is a much
better way but <.> mu </.> much more uhm <,> even way right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#63:1:A>
So you find nothing drains out <,> okay and after that you can
simply add in the rest alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#64:1:A>
So soda and water has been added in <,> the next thing you find in
the seasoning column is that I  ' ve got sugar right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#65:1:A>
So why do we add in sugar because we like to have a blended taste
alright and at home <,> uh normally we don't add in too much of what we call
the MSG <,> <unc> 1-word </unc> alright so what to do is a pinch of
sugar to balance the taste out right so a quarter teaspoon of sugar <,> half
the tablespoon of corn flour or corn starch whatever way you call it

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#66:1:A>
I have double <,,> alright <,> half a tablespoon and then I have
<,> half a <.> tables </.> three quarter tablespoon of the light soya sauce
right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#67:1:A>
Light soya sauce how do you call it <indig> saan chau </indig> <,>
right and this is what we call the dark soya we call it the <indig> lou chau
</indig> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#68:1:A>
Now how would you know the difference when you shake the bottle you
notice <,> the colour stays there longer that is thicker and darker <,> the
colour here is thinner <,> alright and lighter <,> then this is <indig> saan
chau </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#69:1:A>
<indig> Saan chau </indig> is more used for <,> seasoning <,> that
is more choose for colour or stewing <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#70:1:A>
So <indig> saan chau </indig> which is a three quarter tablespoon
for one portion <,> three quarter tablespoon for my other portions it  ' s
double alright and then I got oil <,> or water is already in there you can
also add in a few shakes of pepper if you want to <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#71:1:A>
So oil <,> is about a tablespoon <,> one for one portion that is
for my <,> double alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#72:1:A>
So everything is in there <,> you mix

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#73:1:A>
So you got a <unc> 1-word </unc> sugar a bit of soya sauce
and a bit of oil forming in nice and glossy <,> because you notice when you
go to the local market to buy beef <,> and vegetable to the <,> uh
supermarket to buy rib eye you got no fat in <,> alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#74:1:A>
So add a bit of oil to make it nice and glossy and also the water
make it juicy later on <,> right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#75:1:A>
Adding up all the liquid there <,> there should be about two to
three tablespoon of liquid but take a look <,> nothing drains out <,> the
reason for that is because <unc> several-words </unc> every single
piece of beef is nicely well seasoned <,> okay right

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#76:1:A>
So that is what we call the seasoning of the beef

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#77:1:A>
Now for beef you can season it well in advance <,> may be for half
an hour an hour or even overnight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#78:1:A>
Now if you are going to marinate it overnight let  ' s say you have
planned to do it tomorrow <,> uhm guests coming <,> you have to do some
preparation <,> before you put into fridge <,> one of the secret to keep in
the fridge to keep it nice and <,> fresh is that have a little bit of oil <,>
like this on top <,> and this little bit of oil you don't mix that is <?>
sits </?> right on top of the beef and that <.> some </.> somewhat form a
covering <,> right seals if off and then prevent it from drying and again
your <unc> 2-words </unc> your plaster wrap or your <unc> 1-word
</unc> foil and the whole thing put into fridge

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#79:1:A>
The next day when you take it out <,> just stir and every single
piece of meat will be well used enough because of the oil that seeps through
it alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#80:1:A>
So if you  ' re going to leave overnight <,> for hour or two <,>
morning till evening a little bit of oil on top <,> alright so that  ' s the
way to keep it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#81:1:A>
So that  ' s my <,> double portions of beef that I prepare same with
pork same with chicken it  ' s only pork and chicken <,> you don't add in soda
<,> beef we add in soda to make sure they  ' re very nice and tender alright

<ICE-HK:S2A-052#82:1:A>
So that is the marinating </I>
