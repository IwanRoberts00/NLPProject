<bold> New Year messages stress stability </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#2:1>
THE Chinese leadership has stressed economic construction and
social stability in its New Year messages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#3:1>
In an editorial , the <it> People  ' s Daily </it> said the party
and the Government would persevere with economic construction and reform .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#4:1>
And in a message broadcast last night by Beijing Radio , President
Mr Yang Shangkun warned that social turmoil and instability could wreak havoc
on the nation  ' s promising economic development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#5:1>
The <it> People  ' s Daily </it> said : &ldquo; Practice has shown
that the nation and the people have benefited from the insistence on taking
economic construction as the core &obrack; of national work &cbrack; .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#6:1>
&ldquo; If we depart from this core , the country will be ruined
and the people will be hit with damages . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#7:1>
The party mouthpiece said the country must lose no time in
deepening reform and opening the door wider . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#8:1>
&ldquo; The room for reform is still very large , and the tasks of
reform very heavy , &rdquo; it said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#9:1>
The paper pointed to the need to promote ideological
indoctrination and party construction , but made no mention of the crusade
against &ldquo; peaceful evolution &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#10:1>
China analysts said the editorial reflected patriarch Mr Deng
Xiaoping  ' s instructions about down-playing class struggle and concentrating
on economic progress . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#11:1>
In his message , Mr Yang alluded to chaotic conditions in the
former Soviet Union and in many Eastern European countries when he pleaded
for political stability . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#12:1>
&ldquo; Historical facts show that no country in the world has
ever succeeded in reforms while the society is in turmoil , &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#13:1>
Mr Yang , considered an ally of Mr Deng  ' s , said he wanted to
assure &ldquo; foreign friends &rdquo; that there was no foundation for
doubting that Beijing would continue with its reforms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#14:1>
The President promised that China would &ldquo; accelerate the
pace of carrying out reforms and opening to the outside world &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#15:1>
&ldquo; Reform and the open policy have brought about tremendous
progress and development in China , and there is no reason for China to stop
carrying them out , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#16:1>
Analysts said it was significant that Mr Yang did not make any
reference to leftist goals such as stemming &ldquo; bourgeois liberalisation
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#17:1>
Meanwhile , the Chinese media has continued its attack on the
&ldquo; mess &rdquo; brought about by radical reforms initiated by former
Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#18:1>
In a critical year-end analysis on the former Soviet Union , the
<it> People  ' s Daily </it> quoted foreign observers as saying that the Soviet
Union  ' s dissolution was &ldquo; a tragedy &rdquo; and that the problems
there might take many years to resolve . </p> </I>

<bold> Christians urged to help build socialism </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#20:2>
THE Fifth National Conference on Christianity has opened in
Beijing with a call to members of the state-affiliated Protestant churches to
make contributions to socialist construction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#21:2>
And the semi-official China News Service has characterised as a
&ldquo; fabrication &rdquo; a report by a Western news agency that Catholic
priest Father Li Zhenrong of Cangzhou , Hebei province , has been arrested .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#22:2>
The seven-day conference was organised by the
government-sanctioned China Christian Council &obrack; CCC &cbrack; and its
twin body , the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Protestant
Churches &obrack; TSPM &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#23:2>
TSPM vice-president Mr Shen Derong said yesterday Christian
activities had vastly expanded . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#24:2>
There were now almost five million converts , and the number of
churches had grown from about 4,000 in 1986 to more than 7,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#25:2>
Mr Shen called on Christians to &ldquo; love their country and
their religion &rdquo; by making contributions to socialist construction .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#26:2>
He said many Christians had been selected as &ldquo; model
workers &rdquo; and &ldquo; advanced figures &rdquo; in their work units .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#27:2>
The conference was chaired by Bishop Ding Guangxun , who is chief of
the CCC and the TSPM . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#28:2>
Chinese sources said following Beijing  ' s call to heighten
vigilance against &ldquo; foreign infiltration through religion &rdquo; , the
patriotic churches had tried to ensure that their members abided by the
socialist ethos . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#29:2>
Crackdowns on illegal house churches , which claim more than 40
million affiliates , have been stepped up . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#30:2>
Bishop Ding , who disapproved of the June 4 crackdown , has
largely kept a low profile in the past two years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#31:2>
In other developments the China News Service said in a dispatch
last night , that Father Li Zhenrong was in hospital for cancer treatment in
Tianjin and had not been detained by police . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#32:2>
The agency also denied foreign press reports that Beijing had
clamped down on Christmas celebrations . </p>

<bold> President in bid slow down growth </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#35:3>
<bold> By WILLY WO-LAP LAM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#36:3>
PRESIDENT Jiang Zemin has revised patriarch Deng Xiaping  ' s
high-growth policy in order to &ldquo; avert major upheavals &rdquo; in the
country . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#37:3>
In an unusually frank appraisal of the socio-economic situation ,
Mr Jiang called for a full scale campaign to cool down the economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#38:3>
Mr Jiang  ' s latest instructions , which have been interpreted as
an indirect critique of Mr Deng  ' s views , will be published in this month  ' s
issue of the Chinese-funded Hongkong magazine, <it> Bauhinia </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#39:3>
&ldquo; The central authorities have raised &obrack; the slogan
of &cbrack; preventing the economy from overheating in order to avert major
upheavals and major losses , &ldquo; said Mr Jiang , who nonetheless admitted
that &ldquo; small-scale shocks are inevitable &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#40:3>
Referring to the excessively ambitious goals of the regions , Mr
Jiang said : &ldquo; Economic development must be based on objective reality .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#41:3>
Places which have the qualifications can go as fast as they like .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#42:3>
Those that do not yet have the qualifications should not force
themselves . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#43:3>
He added that a &ldquo; relative high speed of development
&rdquo; must be achieved in tandem with a &ldquo; rational economic structure
&rdquo; and with a balanced growth between various geographical and economic
sectors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#44:3>
Mr Jiang cited three problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#45:3>
First , he said , efforts must be made to crack down on
corruption , especially the phenomenon of &ldquo; exchanging power for money
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#46:3>
Second , income disparity between the coast and the hinterland ,
and that between the rich and the poor , must be narrowed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#47:3>
Third , Mr Jiang indicated , inflation must be tamed , and
adequate levels of prices , interest rates and foreign exchange rates must be
sought . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#48:3>
In an apparent reference to Mr Deng  ' s four-month-old dictum
about &ldquo; seizing the opportunities &rdquo; for fast growth .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#49:3>
Mr Jiang said : &ldquo; Seizing the opportunities and speeding up
development must be done on the premises of China  ' s actual conditions of the
moment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#50:3>
&ldquo; We must insist on the synthesis of the liberation of
thought and seeking truth from facts, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#51:3>
Apparently with the Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s in mind
, Mr Jiang added : &ldquo; We must take the lesson from the various major
economic ups and downs in history . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#52:3>
The party chief added only then could a party member implement Mr
Deng  ' s instructions &ldquo; in a comprehensive , correct and positive manner
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#53:3>
China sources said Mr Jiang was subtly repeating the criticism
that conservative leaders including Chen Yun had levelled against Mr Dengs  ' s
&ldquo; high growth model &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#54:3>
&ldquo; By saying that cadres should interpret Deng  ' s
instructions in a comprehensive and correct manner , Jiang is in fact
revising them, &rdquo; a source said . </p> </I>

<bold> Reduction in troop numbers </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#57:4>
CHINA will make further cuts in troop strength as it streamlines
its military in the next decade , according to the official <it> Liberation
Army Daily </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#58:4>
Chinese military sources said the decision to trim the rank and
file was made during an expanded meeting of the Central Military Commission
&obrack; CMC &cbrack; in Beijing last month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#59:4>
The sources said while the final figure was still up to
negotiation , about one million members of the People  ' s Liberation Army
&obrack; PLA &cbrack; will be laid off in the Eighth Five-Year Plan &obrack;
1991-1995 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#60:4>
The PLA &dash; the world  ' s largest armed force &dash; had
demobilized one million men since 1985 and further reductions were essential
for its future , the paper said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#61:4>
It said the main aim was to promote efficiency and make savings .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#62:4>
&ldquo; Practice tells us we must take the road of excellence in
soldiering , the road of reducing quantity and increasing quality .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#63:4>
Only then will there be hope for military modernization, &rdquo; the
newspaper said in a signed commentary yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#64:4>
&ldquo; The remainder of the century is a critical period for
accelerating construction of out state and military, &rdquo; it said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#65:4>
&ldquo; It will decide whether our army realizes the aim of making us
a great nation in the next century in a forest of strong nations . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#66:4>
Western military analysts said the savings would be spent on
sophisticated weapons . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#67:4>
Moreover , various provinces and cities in China have been asked
to use local finances to support reserves crops .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#68:4>
In rich coastal cities such as Guangzhou , the equipment and salaries
of members of the reserves corps are at least comparable with those of the
regular units . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#69:4>
<it> The Liberation Army Daily </it> said a reduction of
international tensions did not necessarily mean China would remain at peace .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#70:4>
&ldquo; Competition in the world is very sharp and contradictions
are increasing day by day .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#71:4>
Hegemonism and power politics still exists, &rdquo; it said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-015#72:4>
&ldquo; Our army must pay high attention to the building of quality
and raising fighting capacity . &rdquo; </p> </I>

<bold> President  ' s protege to take influential post </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> By WILLY WO-LAP LAM </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#75:5>
A KEY protege of president Jiang Zemin , Liu Ji , has been
promoted to Vice-President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences &obrack;
CASS &cbrack; , a post with vice-ministerial status . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#76:5>
Chinese sources said yesterday Mr Liu , who was head of the
bureau for restructuring the economy in Shanghai , has joined other
colleagues from the city in influential posts in the capital . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#77:5>
The sources said the series of promotions was an effort by Mr
Jiang , a former party chief of Shanghai and head of the so-called Shanghai
Faction in Chinese politics , to consolidate his position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#78:5>
Mr Liu , in his mid-50s , began his career as a specialist in
theory and propaganda , rising to vice-chief of the department of propaganda
in Shanghai weeks before Mr Jiang was made party General Secretary in June
1989 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#79:5>
Mr Liu  ' s associates said while he remained a Shanghai official
until the CASS appointment , the Jiang protege had for the past two years
spent more time in Beijing than in Shanghai . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#80:5>
&ldquo; Liu Ji has played a major role in the General Office of
the party Central Committee , which is headed by another former Shanghai
cadre , Zeng Qinghong, &rdquo; a source said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#81:5>
&ldquo; For example , he has helped Jiang Zemin draft documents ,
including the Political Report of the 14th Party Congress last October .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#82:5>
The source said given the expanding clout of Mr Jiang , Mr Liu
could continue to rise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#83:5>
He added Mr Jiang had originally wanted to make Mr Liu a
vice-head of the Central Committee  ' s Propaganda Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#84:5>
It is understood that last February , Mr Liu undertook a secret
mission on Mr Jiang  ' s behalf to the United States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#85:5>
There , Mr Liu sounded out several dissidents and former Chinese
officials on the possibility of their return to China to work for the General
Secretary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#86:5>
Chinese intellectuals who have worked with Mr Liu described him
as an &ldquo; efficient pragmatist &rdquo; who had no fixed position on
ideological matters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#87:5>
Other Shanghai cadres who have recently been called to Beijing
include the vice-chief of propaganda Gong Xinhan and the party secretary of
<it> Liberation Daily </it> Zhou Ruijin . </p> </I>

<bold> PM pitches in to help &lsquo; green &rsquo; fund </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#89:6>
PRIME Minister Li Peng has donated 1,000 yuan &obrack;
HK&dollar;1,340 &cbrack; to the Foundation for Protecting the China
Environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#90:6>
The China News Services &obrack; CNS &cbrack; reported last night
Mr Li had &ldquo; in his personal capacity &rdquo; made the donation on the
eve of World Environment Day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#91:6>
Mr Li , who has not been seen in public since April 24 ,
reportedly also wrote an inscription for the foundation , which said &ldquo;
An achievement in this generation will benefit posterity for 1,000 years
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#92:6>
CNS pointed out that Mr Li had always paid a lot of attention to
environmental issues . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#93:6>
For example , he was the head of the State Council  ' s first
committee to protect the environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#94:6>
CNS said under Mr Li  ' s leadership , the Government had come up
with a series of laws , regulations and policies on the environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#95:6>
The official news service also highlighted the fact that in 1987
, Mr Li received a gold medal from the United Nations for his contributions
in this area . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#96:6>
Yesterday , the official New China News Agency also reported that
Mr Li had sent a message of congratulation to his Yemeni counterpart , Haider
Abu Bakr al-Attas , on his re-election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#97:6>
Mr Li sent a message to the Yemeni leader on Wednesday , NCNA
reported . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#98:6>
Western diplomats said since Mr Li succumbed to the mysterious
illness six weeks ago , the propaganda machinery had let on that he was
making a fast recovery and attending to some affairs of state . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#99:6>
However , the electronic media yesterday failed to show an image
of the 65-year-old head of the State Council . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-015#100:6>
The diplomats said with expectations of his re-appearance
building up , Mr Li would show up in public as soon as his doctors allowed
him to . </p>
