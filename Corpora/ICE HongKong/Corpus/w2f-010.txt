SHARON SUNG SAU FUN </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#3:1>
I was the only one at home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#4:1>
After eating last night  ' s leftovers for lunch , I threw myself onto
the bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#5:1>
My eyes fixed on the ceiling and I was thinking of what to do next .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#6:1>
Listening to the television could not dissipate my boredom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#7:1>
Just like the previous times , the idea of &ldquo; treasure seeking
&rdquo; stuck me all of a sudden .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#8:1>
My sister and I shared the same room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#9:1>
Even though I knew every single one of her belongings inside out , I
still secretly enjoyed checking out her stuff every now and then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#10:1>
Just as in the past , I fumbled for her key under the earthenware
money-box on the top shelf .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#11:1>
The next moment I was sitting on my sister  ' s bed and unlocking her
personal drawer in the little cabinet by her bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#12:1>
Again I looked into her school result records , yearbooks , the
little gifts given by her friends , and her collection of invaluable
ornaments .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#13:1>
The entire examination took less than an hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#14:1>
To my disappointment , she did not have any new items in her
collection .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#15:1>
Locking up her drawing , I lay flat on her bed dwelling on my boredom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#16:1>
I stretched my arms and was about to fold them behind my head when
they hit upon something underneath her pillow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#17:1>
I pulled it out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#18:1>
An elegant diary in a deep-red velvet cover was before me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#19:1>
In my many years of treasure-seeking , I had never learned that my
sister kept a diary .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#20:1>
She must have forgotten to put it back in its safe place after
writing in it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#21:1>
I took a quick deep breath and flipped it open . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#22:1>
<it> 12 November 1978

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#23:1>
&ldquo; Open that damn door , I  ' ll throw this eyesore out of my
place ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#24:1>
Frenzy in her eyes , the distraught mother of five yelled at the rest
of her children while her hand which was grasping hold of her 14-year-old
daughter  ' s hair made a sudden jerk .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#25:1>
A loud shriek immediately followed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#26:1>
The little girl with her hands pressing against her hair from the
pull had her body twisted under the pain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#27:1>
Wailing plaintively , she asked herself what she had done wrong this
time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#28:1>
&ldquo; Don't get angry with that kid , she didn't mean to disobey
you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#29:1>
It is only because she wanted to study for her exam that she
suggested you make the little brother mop the floor for her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#30:1>
Anyway , she has already had enough by now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#31:1>
For my sake , let her go . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#32:1>
The helpless father who was back home on leave from his sailor  ' s job
forced out a pleasing voice and look , trying his best to soothe his wife  ' s
fury .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#33:1>
&ldquo; Don't get yourself involved in it , it  ' s none of your
business !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#34:1>
You  ' d better stay out of my way ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#35:1>
His wife  ' s furious eyes turned upon him , whereupon he no longer
uttered another word.

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#36:1>
The horrified children were scared stiff by the scene even though it
was not the first time their mother had acted in this manner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#37:1>
They hid behind the half-opened kitchen door next to the main gate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#38:1>
They stayed motionless despite their mother  ' s howling order :

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#39:1>
&ldquo; Don't you all hear me ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#40:1>
Go open that damn door ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#41:1>
The mother was getting more furious .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#42:1>
The little girl was twitching in response to her mother  ' s hysteria .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#43:1>
She struggled to wriggle free from the grip but stopped after a crisp
hot slap on her left ear .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#44:1>
In contrast to the burning on her face , a surge of coolness ran
quickly down to her heart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#45:1>
She was no longer crying and her eyes were fixed on somewhere remote .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#46:1>
While his little brothers and sister were squatting and covering
their ears with their little shrinking hands , the eldest son , a year older
than the little girl , with an emotionless face , strode out of the kitchen ,
approached the main door , unlocked and thrust it wide open .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#47:1>
&ldquo; Get away from my place .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#48:1>
I don't want you to be my daughter and you stay out of my sight !
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#49:1>
The frenzied mother , with all her strength , dragged her daughter
toward the door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#50:1>
In the wake of the pain from her head , the little girl begged her
mother to stop while firmly clinging to the kitchen  ' s threshold with one of
her hands .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#51:1>
Boiling with uncontrollable anger , after failing to detach the
little body from the threshold , the mother abruptly hit her daughter  ' s head
frantically against the wall .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#52:1>
Giddy from the blows , the girl  ' s grip involuntarily loosened at
last .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#53:1>
She was thrust out of the door which banged in her face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#54:1>
After warning everyone to stay away from the door , the mother dashed
back to her room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#55:1>
Not knowing what to do , the frustrated father trailed his wife to
the room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#56:1>
In the living room , the children watched helplessly at their sister
who sobbed outside the gate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#57:1>
Her brother waited until he heard his mother  ' s snoring &semi; he
walked towards the door , unlocked it and let his sister in. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#58:1>
Raising my eyes from the diary , I stared out of the window .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#59:1>
If it was not for her diary , I might have all these unpleasant
scenes buried with the past , and gone from my memory .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#60:1>
I was very young then , three years old , I guess .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#61:1>
Our family was very poor then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#62:1>
Our father , for the sake of the appealing salary , worked as a
sailor and spent twice the time working at sea than with his wife and
children on land .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#63:1>
Our mother , from Macau and with no relatives in Hong Kong , was on
her own to care for five little children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#64:1>
The family burden probably was too heavy for a helpless woman and her
accumulated frustration finally turned on her children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#65:1>
Unfortunately , my sister had always been at the receiving end .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#66:1>
Why was it her ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#67:1>
I did not really know , but I always knew my mother was one of those
traditional women who favoured their sons over their daughters .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#68:1>
My sister and I were the only girls in the family , and I was then
too little and fragile to be ill-treated .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#69:1>
Feeling a bit reluctant to continue with those scenes , I leaped some
pages ahead . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#70:1>
<it> 19-30 November 1978

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#71:1>
The brother had his school excursion today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#72:1>
Before dawn , the mother had jumped to her feet , bound to the
kitchen to prepare his food .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#73:1>
As in the previous year , she made a pack of fried-egg sandwiches , a
couple of sauced chicken-wings and 3 packs of Vitasoy for him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#74:1>
The tempting smell of the chicken-wings made the girl  ' s mouth water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#75:1>
She watched the food enviously , thinking how fortunately her brother
was to have such delicious food for an excursion .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#76:1>
Then when she thought of her own excursion the following week , she
forgot about her brother  ' s food and felt the excitement in her at the
approaching date .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#77:1>
At 7am , before the alarm sounded , she sprang from her bed nervously
, stumbled in her slippers , then dashed into the kitchen to greet her food
pack that her mother would have already prepared for her excursion .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#78:1>
Nothing was on the table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#79:1>
No aroma of cooking drifted from the gloomy kitchen and there was no
sign of her mother in the kitchen or the living room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#80:1>
Gingerly she turned the doorknob of her parents  '  bedroom and peeped
into the crack .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#81:1>
Her mother was still sleeping on her bed !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#82:1>
Heart sunk to the bottom , the girl remembered she had given her
mother the excursion notice from school and she surely knew today was the
date .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#83:1>
A hand rested on her shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#84:1>
Looking over her shoulder , she found her brother behind her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#85:1>
Before she had the chance to say anything , he stuffed something in
her hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#86:1>
Unfolding her hand , she saw a five-dollar coin shimmering on her
little palm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#87:1>
She raised her questioning eyes upon him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#88:1>
He urged her to go to buy some buns and drinks quickly , or the
school bus would leave without her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#89:1>
Overwhelmed with emotions , the girl failed to utter a word .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#90:1>
Again , her brother urged her to hurry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#91:1>
Finally , without any more thought , she gave him a grateful glance ,
dashed down the stairs and disappeared into the street. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#92:1>
I turned to the middle of the diary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#93:1>
<it> 1-30 June 1983

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#94:1>
The brother started his own business selling computers five months
ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#95:1>
His sole partner who had seen little profit from the business finally
decided to withdraw from the partnership .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#96:1>
The brother came home to talk to his mother , to borrow money from
her to buy up his partner  ' s share .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#97:1>
Meanwhile , his sister had finished her matriculation study by the
middle of June .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#98:1>
Among her siblings , she was the one who had achieved the best
results in school .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#99:1>
She , nevertheless , decided to comply with her mother  ' s arrangement
, not to continue with her studies , but to work for her brother who could
not afford to employ anyone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#100:1>
In the bottom of heart , she felt miserable for herself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#101:1>
But for her mother , she knew she would have made an even bigger
sacrifice . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#102:1>
<it> 1-30 October 1984

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#103:1>
The mother once again made a great fuss about the shortage in her
monthly household allowance from her son .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#104:1>
She scolded him for not giving her any money for more than four
months .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#105:1>
The brother had his head lowered before her but did not utter a word .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#106:1>
Seeing his silence , the mother heightened her complaint and accused
him of being irresponsible and unfilial .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#107:1>
Her accusations kept going on and on .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#108:1>
To her own dismay , the sister stepped out from the back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#109:1>
Confronting her mother , she loudly pointed out that the computer
store had never made a profit .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#110:1>
The profit was so little that it was merely enough to meet the rent
and the necessary expenses every month .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#111:1>
She proclaimed that she had never been paid !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#112:1>
Unaccustomed to such a refutation , the mother flushed with anger
and shifted her anger to her daughter .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#113:1>
She lashed out at her daughter  ' s rudeness and ingratitude .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#114:1>
The girl was silent and accepted the scolding . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#115:1>
<it> 24 December 1986

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#116:1>
It was the first time the brother had brought a girl home for dinner
, a very elegant and presentable girl .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#117:1>
She had the average height of Asian women , with long straight hair
and a pair of big watery eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#118:1>
Never had the sister seen her brother so attentive to anyone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#119:1>
He filled the girl  ' s bowl with food , refilled her rice-bowl and
glass .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#120:1>
For an unknown reason , the sister felt a sour surge in her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#121:1>
She was silent and heavy-hearted during the dinner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#122:1>
After the brother left to escort the girl home , the sister returned
to her room and finally burst into tears . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#123:1>
<it> 1 August 1990

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#124:1>
The wedding was splendid .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#125:1>
Being the eldest son of the family , the brother was the pride of
his parents and his wedding was the way they chose to show their dignity to
the world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#126:1>
The sister was watching the newlywed couple file between the fifty
tables .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#127:1>
The elegant bride changed into three sets of evening gown throughout
the wedding banquet , while her bridegroom was busy greeting his business
friends .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#128:1>
After striving for more than seven years , the brother had finally
established his place in the market and earned his reputation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#129:1>
Nevertheless , he seldom noticed that his sister was forever working
at the back of the store , exhausting herself at work till late every night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#130:1>
<it> 3 September 1990 <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#131:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s enough !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#132:1>
I know you are reading my diary

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#133:1>
Whoever you are ,

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#134:1>
I ask you to respect my little privacy and stop reading my diary !
&rdquo; </it> </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-010#135:1>
SNAP !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#136:1>
I involuntarily closed the diary !

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#137:1>
A surge of spooky cold ran down my spine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#138:1>
I turned my head around to look for the sign of another being .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#139:1>
I quickly put the diary back where it had been and smoothed the
crease on the pillow and the bed-sheet before I crept away from my sister  ' s
bed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#140:1>
Late at night , my exhausted sister dragged herself home from work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#141:1>
She was unmarried and still working for my brother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#142:1>
For the first time I examined her carefully .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#143:1>
Now in her late thirties , hardship and time had taken its toll on
her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#144:1>
Never caring much for her appearance , she wore a baggy T-shirt and
a pair of worn-out jeans .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#145:1>
Her temperament was getting worse with age .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#146:1>
She was more emotional , stubborn , judgmental and had a bad temper .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#147:1>
My parents did not dare to bring up the issue of marriage .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#148:1>
We knew that she would be staying with the family and would be
single for the rest of her life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#149:1>
Mother , seeming to regret her ill-treatment of my sister in the
past , had become very caring and attentive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-010#150:1>
Many nights , she would lend her listening ears to my sister  ' s
complaints of her work , no matter how rude and mean my sister was to her .
</p> </I>
