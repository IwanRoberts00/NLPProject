<ICE-HK:S2B-047#1:1:A>
I was very relaxed this morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#2:1:A>
Thank you to uh <unc> 1-word </unc> International for the
excellent dinner reception and breakfast this morning

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#3:1:A>
But that relaxation only lasted until I walked into this room and
the <?> front page </?> of <unc> 1-word </unc> International really
<unc> 1-word </unc> <?> they were shocked </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#4:1:A>
I do hope that uh eventually I can walk <unc> 2-words </unc>
uh without the fold that means absolutely <unc> several-words </unc>
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#5:1:A>
Today the subject  ' s on uh <?> managing </?> shipping agencies

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#6:1:A>
And I think I will speak it on the basis of Hong Kong environment
and <unc> several-words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#7:1:A>
Containerization since the sixties has gone through stages of
development

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#8:1:A>
Shipping companies <?> and its partners </?> have created many
important <unc> 1-word </unc> providing much more comprehensive cargo
transportation services to shippers in relation to in relation to <?> goods
</?> transport <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#9:1:A>
The growth in international trade the rapid development in
telecommunication the ease of international travel and the changes in buying
practices are all important factors influencing an ever-changing and
increasingly demanding environment that shipping companies shipping agencies
companies have to manage to develop their products and services <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#10:1:A>
The role of shipping agents by and large remain under the same
broad categories in the last twenty fifty years <,> that is the low cooperation
including ship <unc> 1-word </unc> documentation accounting sales and
marketing <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#11:1:A>
Under these broad categories the functions provided by agents
office have been subject to varying degree of changes depending on
individual relationship and conditions

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#12:1:A>
They have <?> their respective </?> principles
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#13:1:A>
Perhaps a quick general view of this important <?> primary
</?> class will give us a better insight into the future of <?>
running a </?> shipping agencies business in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#14:1:A>
In conventional shipping <,> principals rely greatly on local
agents to provide efficient and reliable stevedores <,> and
cargo handling services to ensure prompt dispatch of the vessels <,> minimum
cargo damage <unc> 1-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#15:1:A>
But today most of the <unc> 1-word </unc> vessels are
employed on regular <unc> 3- words </unc> rate with fix day schedule
subject to minimal <?> one-time </?> allowance

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#16:1:A>
The handling of containers particularly the interface between
terminals and ships is now largely relying on terminal operators both at Kwai
Chung and for midstream operations <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#17:1:A>
Shipping agents  '  <?> direct </?> involvement in these areas
is becoming <?> a minor role </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#18:1:A>
Although a very important one in ensuring ships are able to 
keep to their planned schedules <,> the shipping agent  ' s role in
operations has changed its emphasis from container control container repair
and maintenance <,> CFS <?> forms submission </?> and FCS haulage <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#19:1:A>
Accurate long and short term forecasts and good logistics
management <,> often are key factors affecting shipping rise operating
costs in the port <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#20:1:A>
With containerization <,> shipping lines do not have many
variable costs but container logistics will have serious financial
implications <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#21:1:A>
Although there are many computer software and working systems
designed by individual shipping lines or computer companies a capable and 
experienced work force is supplemental in achieving desirable results

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#22:1:A>
In other words it is no longer sufficient to give satisfaction to
shipping principals merely to conclude competitive and reliable cargo
services <?> control </?> and general supervision 

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#> Agency set up has provided the required expertise manage in the
very competitive environment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#25:1:A>
As for CFS cargo solution and FCL inland haulage in
some form they still can be viewed as an extension of conventional shipping
services except that the standard and response times now are much higher <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#26:1:A>
Computer applications are now part of our everyday lives and almost
impossible for today  ' s shipping services to function without an effective
and efficient computer system to provide supplementary <?> products
</?> and controlling monitoring functions including the accounting 
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#27:1:A>
The provision of accurate bills of lading or manifests
no longer satisfy today  ' s demand

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#28:1:A>
Customers interface <,> terminal interface <,>
in the <unc> 1-word </unc> are some of the more common EDI applications <,>
shipping lines are now actively engaging in

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#30:1:A>
The local knowledge and the correct judgment of local demands are
extremely important <,,> information and input to these very expensive computer
software and hardware development <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#32:1:A>
On accounting although the accounting practice has <?> seen </> very little
or any change today  ' s financial control is extremely important in cash flow
which demands very efficient accounting work

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#34:1:A>
Furthermore the sum of freight and charges handled by shipping
agents can be very substantial <,> and the principals are increasingly concerned
<?> about </?> agents  '  financial and liability status <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#35:1:A>
When I first joined the shipping circle in <unc> 1-word
</unc> I was educated to believe that most of the shipping sales could be
concluded in the <?> port </?> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#36:1:A>
While this may be very true perhaps some twenty odd years ago
the containerization evolution has generated a different product
which required a lot more selling on top of just personal relationship and
reputation

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#38:1:A>
Shippers are increasingly conscious of true transportation costs

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#39:1:A>
Market in shipping no longer restricts itself to the creation of 
reliable service and provision of appropriate schedule frequency <,> and
capacity

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#40:1:A>
Rather it has developed into a more diversify product involving in
the true transportation change and documentary credit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#41:1:A>
Summarising the above because of the fact that local agents are
required to provide not only competent and experienced work force but also
require innovative and practical participation in the development of
shipping products in line with the individual shipping companies <unc>
two-words </unc> policy and philosophy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#42:1:A>
Shipping agency business like any other business are set up to
provide a product to shipping principal and expected to be adequately remunerated 
making a profit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#43:1:A>
But in today  ' s Hong Kong operating costs and service requirement from
the principals are very high

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#44:1:A>
The profit margin is rapidly shrinking <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#45:1:A>
With majority of agency costs being fixed costs in office and staff
<?> total </?> the profit margin improvement depends on staff  ' s
<.> produc </.> productivity which may be achievable through automation and
skill training

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#46:1:A>
However it is perfectly clear to you that profitibility
is to a very large extent volume-related

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#47:1:A>
It is the high volume shipping principals that independent agency
companies are actively seeking <,> but it is also true that it is these shipping lines who 
demand the highest standard

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#49:1:A>
Value for money <unc> several-words </unc> are also true to
some extent in our industry <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#50:1:A>
Many people debate whether independent shipping agents costs are
higher or lower than shipping lines  '  own agency offices

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#51:1:A>
It is difficult to <.> con </.> to draw a conclusion as this really
depends on many subjective factors between the two parties involved <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#52:1:A>
However no shipping principals take lightly on agency appointment
or changes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#53:1:A>
 I think financial implication is not necessarily the only
parameter considered by shipping principals in their choice of agents

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#54:1:A>
It is very much the ability of agents in fulfilling the needs the
capability that counts <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#55:1:A>
It is the local agents  '  <,> capabilities and adaptability to
principals  '  changing policy <,> and strategy that they <unc> 1-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#56:1:A>
It is the agents  '  reputation integrity long expertise and
a well-trained <?> people </?> force that principals are buying

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#57:1:A>
The relationship between agents and principals is becoming even
closer and intimate developing into more of a partnership relationship <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#58:1:A>
The future of independent shipping agents <unc> 2-words
</unc> is positive and through a bigger demand and continuous expansion
and diversification

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#59:1:A>
Agency companies survive and flourish depending upon their ability
to fulfill the needs of their principals

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#60:1:A>
Understanding and appreciation of individual shipping principals
<,> culture philosophy and policies

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#61:1:A>
Flexible and effective organization structures are required to meet
these different demands from different principals

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#62:1:A>
It is in my opinion extremely important for agents to be alert to
his performance <,> contribution to principal  ' s business

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#63:1:A>
Dissatisfaction often leads to undesirable consequences

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#64:1:A>
Good communication at all levels is the 
foundation of the principals-agent relationship <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#65:1:A>
Having put all these positives to shipping agency business future
in Hong Kong <,> one cannot exclude to mention the fatal blow

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#66:1:A>
<unc> 1-word </unc> frequently people aware of brand name

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#67:1:A>
If a shipping line takes brand name international
network as authority in its agency appointment excluding commercial and
financial implications then the best future for independent shipping agents
office in Hong Kong will be reduced to equity
participation or to contractual service provision <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#68:1:A>
I think I will put this as a stop to my speech 
<ICE-HK:S2B-047#> Maybe later we can
discuss <unc> several-words </unc> subject <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#69:1:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-047#70:2:A>
Thank you

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#71:2:A>
Ladies and gentlemen it  ' s uh this is not my speech

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#72:2:A>
It  ' s just the brochure

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#73:2:A>
<?> I </?> just scribbled some notes on it

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#74:2:A>
Uh <,> there  ' s been a lot of Hong Kong bashing lately <?> saying
</?> that uh some people like to see the place closed after June thirtieth
nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#75:2:A>
Well my candid answer to that is they will be awfully disappointed
because not only will not Hong Kong go down the drain it will even be more
prosperous

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#76:2:A>
Hong Kong is fortunate that we are at the doorstep of one point two
billion people who have made a major swing in their economic policy with
nineteen seventy-eight Deng Xia Ping  ' s open door policy

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#77:2:A>
Now if we look back at <.> ni </.> at China nineteen forty-nine
<.> s s </.> starting from nineteen forty-nine they have gone to one thousand
and one literally all sorts of economic policies whether it  ' s central
planning whether it  ' s nationalization or private plots the great leap
forward the communes the Cultural Revolution

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#78:2:A>
You name it they  ' ve got it

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#79:2:A>
And after thirty years they did not find any refrigerators nor
color TVs in the average homes not even telephones

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#80:2:A>
So Deng Xia Ping in nineteen seventy-eight said <quote> we are
going to have policy change

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#81:2:A>
We are going to have open door

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#82:2:A>
We are going to have reform </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#83:2:A>
And I believe later this was widely copied by all the East European
countries as well as Russia

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#84:2:A>
If you uh analyze what Gorbachev was saying

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#85:2:A>
He said <foreign> glasnost </foreign> and he said <foreign>
perestroika </foreign>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#86:2:A>
It  ' s the same as reform and open door

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#87:2:A>
And of course we have seen how successful China has been since
nineteen seventy-eight because one of their biggest problems right now is how
to deal with the Americans America United States of America on their close to
a thirty billion US dollar trade surplus

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#88:2:A>
So Hong Kong is so fortunate in that we are right next door to this
one point two billion people <,> who after thirty years of fumbling to find a
sound economic policy and now they have had hit it because you do find there  ' re
a lot of color TVs and refrigerators in the average Chinese home <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#89:2:A>
And with Hong Kong  ' s expertise on the manufacturing on the trading
on the uh services financial expertise and whatever and Hong Kong people can
rise to any occasion

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#90:2:A>
So I would like to to quote what F <.> D </.> DR Franklin Roosevelt
was telling the Americans in the thirties when America was in financial
trouble and he said <quote> we have nothing to fear but fear itself </quote>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#91:2:A>
I find that after nineteen ninety-seven I know exactly what  ' s <?>
going </?> to happen to Hong Kong because it will be nineteen ninety-eight
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#92:2:A>
As long as Hong Kong <.> s </.> stays with a very practical tax
rate a very attractive and practical tax rate sensible policies I think Hong
Kong can survive this change of sovereignty

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#93:2:A>
Because if we look at what the changes have made it has been
amazing in in China

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#94:2:A>
Well China wasn't the only one that has made that policy change

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#95:2:A>
I notice that one of the most the strongest <,> one of the
strongest economies of the world that has emerged after nineteen forty-five
was Japan

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#96:2:A>
And if we look at Japan  ' s policies

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#97:2:A>
In nineteen forty one they decided to expand militarily

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#98:2:A>
They sent and dropped bombs and torpedoes on Pearl Harbour

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#99:2:A>
They didn't win that war

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#100:2:A>
They retreated and twenty years later they dropped Sonys and
Toyotas in America and I think they  ' ve won that war

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#101:2:A>
So for Hong Kong we  ' re not going to be bashed by people who
really believe that we  ' re going to close down for for business in nineteen
ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#102:2:A>
I think if they come in nineteen ninety eight they will say well
how come the the Hong Kong is still going

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#103:2:A>
But of course this is no surprise to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#104:2:A>
Hong Kong  ' s success has been what Governor Patten has said

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#105:2:A>
I remember his speech

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#106:2:A>
I heard it on the radio

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#107:2:A>
He said <quote> this is an Executive-led government </quote> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#108:2:A>
There has been some very <,> uh proven policies of the
Executive-led government

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#109:2:A>
One of them is what <.> Donal </.> Donald Tsang the Financial
Secretary has been crying out

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#110:2:A>
<quote> We must charge the fees <,> and the uh for the users who
<?> will pay them </?> </quote> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#111:2:A>
There has been safety nets for the people who are less fortunate
<,> to make it people out of jobs people who are old people who don't have
the resources

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#112:2:A>
But on the other hand it  ' s just enough rather than to give them
as entitlements and to give them as a matter of right

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#113:2:A>
Hong Kong Government  ' s policy on education has been that we will
provide education for everybody at greatly subsidized levels <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#114:2:A>
About fifty percent of Hong Kong  ' s people live in subsidized
housing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#115:2:A>
The medical <,> policies of Hong Kong Government is such that <,>
we believe that Hong Kong Government has solved the problem much better than
the MediAid and MediCare of <.> Am </.> of America <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#116:2:A>
And to sum it up very simply Hong Kong has got roughly uh between
five thousand to six thousand US dollars of per capita savings in the coffers

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#117:2:A>
Now let  ' s look at what America has done since the fifties

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#118:2:A>
In the fifties America was <,> one of the certainly it was one of the leading
 uh uh uh nation in terms of wealth <,> 

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#119:2:A>
But after nineteen sixty-five when Lyndon Johnson introduced the
concept of Entitlements introduced the concept of the Great Society this is
<?> a </?> massive free lunch program in that people are given their
entitlements

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#120:2:A>
If you don't have a job you are entitled to have so much money

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#121:2:A>
You don't have to work

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#122:2:A>
You have so many programs that are just hand-outs

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#123:2:A>
Now at that time I remember I was a much younger man

<ICE-HK:S2B-047#124:2:A>
Uh I thought this is a great idea that the government would be
able to do all these things </I>
