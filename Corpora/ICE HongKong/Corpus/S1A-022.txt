</[1> hoping to attend the fitness training course

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#7:1:A>

timetable <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> so I and Florence just <,> uhm <,,> went to
play table tennis <,> for about half an hour <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#8:1:A>

Three circles

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X16:1:Z>
How long is that how long did you take </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#17:1:A>
About uh three minutes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X18:1:Z>
Oh okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X19:1:Z>
Round the tennis court </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#20:1:A>
Yes <,> but the environment wasn't very good

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X21:1:Z>
For jogging </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#22:1:A>
Yes because there is a construction site <,> uhm in the road
and the environment was very noisy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X23:1:Z>
Uhm oh construction

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X24:1:Z>
What construction </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#25:1:A>
Uhm I don't <{> <[> know </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X26:1:Z>
<[> What are </[> </{> they trying to construct </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#27:1:A>
Uhm <,> the road was dug up <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#28:1:A>
I don't know whether they would <,> put some pipes under the road
or not

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X29:1:Z>
Uhm <{> <[> <unc> two words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#30:1:A>
<[> Or the </[> </{> the roads in Hong Kong <,> are always dug

<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> to the normal stage

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X31:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X32:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X33:1:Z>
Oh okay <?> but though </?> you didn't know exactly what they are
doing <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X34:1:Z>
Are they </[> trying to <,> construct the underground tunnel </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#35:1:A>
<[> I don't know </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#36:1:A>
No <,> no

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X37:1:Z>
Not the overseas tunnel </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#38:1:A>
It  ' s too expensive to construct the old the the <,> tunnel
under the road

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X39:1:Z>
Uhm <,> but there  ' s a new one coming up isn't it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#40:1:A>
Which one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X41:1:Z>
There is a third <,> oversea tunnel </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#42:1:A>
Third <{> <[> oversea </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X43:1:Z>
<[> To </[> </{> connect Hong Kong Island and Kowloon </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#44:1:A>
Really

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#45:1:A>
<{> <[> I never heard of that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X46:1:Z>
<[> Yes I was told </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X47:1:Z>
I was told <,> by uh one of the senior lecturer <,> that they are
constructing another tunnel <{1> <[1> on </[1> the Western side of <,> Hong
Kong Island <,> <{2> <[2> to Kowloon </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X48:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#49:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#50:1:A>
<[2> To Kowloon </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#51:1:A>
Really

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X52:1:Z>
Uhm that  ' s what I was told

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X53:1:Z>
The <?> phase </?> should complete <,> maybe in nineteen ninety
seven or ninety eight </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#54:1:A>
I don't think so because uhm Hong Kong government <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> may not spend uhm <,> so large amount of money <{2> <[2> <,>
building another <?> kind </?> of tunnel </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X55:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X56:1:Z>
<[2> Oh I see <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X57:1:Z>
Then there  ' s </[2> </{2> something for us to find out <,> whether
that  ' s true or not true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#58:1:A>
It  ' s not my business

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X59:1:Z>
Why is that <O> both laugh </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X60:1:Z>
You are a Hong Konger how can you say it  ' s not your business <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X61:1:Z>
<?> Well </?> it  ' s something to find out whether that  ' s true or
not true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#62:1:A>
But this kind of social policy <,> does not affect my life <,>
so I <{> <[> would not spend time <,> </[> to find out the answer

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X63:1:Z>
<[> Uh oh no </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X64:1:Z>
Very selfish uh but it affects traffic flow

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X65:1:Z>
It affects uhm <,> daily life of people who lives around <,> Hong
Kong and they have to work in Kowloon and people who is to work in Kowloon or
they when they stay in Hong Kong or or or the other way round </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#66:1:A>
I live in <{> <[> New Territories </[>

<$Z> <X>

<[> So it so it <[> </{> it helps to relieve the traffic

<indig> Aiya </indig> that  ' s not very <,> thoughtful then just

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#69:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#70:1:A>
<{> <[> But I pay attention </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X71:1:Z>
<[> And it also affects </[> </{> the country  ' s economy when

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X75:1:Z>

<[> Let  ' s </[> </{>

Asher

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X79:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#80:1:A>
Have you paid attention <,> to the <,> current issues between
<,> Taiwan and China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X81:1:Z>
I thought I am suppose to ask you the question and not you asking
me the question <{> <[> but </[> anyway <O> laugh </O> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#82:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> we  ' re just talking <O> laugh </O>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X83:1:Z>
Anyway uh <,,> follow-ups <.> fol </.> follow some news <{1> <[1>
and </[1> <,> of course not very very closely <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> knowing
that there was an election going on and it  ' s already over <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X84:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> And so </[3> what do you think about the the situation
then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#85:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#86:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#87:1:A>
<[3> <O> laugh </O> </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#88:1:A>
Okay do you know uhm <,> who has <,> won the election <{> <[> <,>
you know </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#89:1:A>
It  ' s Lee Teng Hui

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X90:1:Z>
<[> Yes of course </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X91:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#92:1:A>
And I think this <,> uhm result is quite unexpected

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X93:1:Z>
Oh I thought it  ' s expected </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#94:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#95:1:A>
Because if I were a Taiwanese <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> I would be very
afraid of the <,> missiles <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> sent off by the <,> Chinese
government <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> and I would choose to vote another candidate
who would advocate the uhm <,> who would not advocate the independence of
Taiwan <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> so as to <,> keep uhm <,> China <,> <{5> <[5>
happy <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#96:1:A>
So uhm I don't think uhm Lee Teng Hui would win the election

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X97:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X98:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X99:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X100:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X101:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm <,> uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X102:1:Z>
Oh I was thinking of the other way round <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X103:1:Z>
It  ' s because of the <,> the threatening <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
exercises that the Chinese government had <{3> <[3> that </[3> actually <,>
unite the Chinese together

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X104:1:Z>
<{4> <[4> Chinese of Taiwan </[4> I mean

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X105:1:Z>
The Chinese in Taiwan <{5> <[5> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X106:1:Z>
<unc> two-words </unc> </[5> people get together when
they are threatened to show the Chinese government of China that <,> we will
be together no matter what happen so they tend to support Lee Teng Hui
instead of <,> the other leaders who doesn't <,> encourage <{6> <[6> <,,>
</[6> the independence of Taiwan </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#107:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#108:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#109:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#110:1:A>
<[4> Unite the Chinese </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#111:1:A>
<[5> Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#112:1:A>
That means </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#113:1:A>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#114:1:A>
But uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#115:1:A>
I <,> I don't think it is wise for the Chinese government <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1> to launch the military exercise <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> to
threaten Taiwan <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#116:1:A>
Because <,> as you have said that <,> it would have uhm <,>
counter-effect to unite <.> th </.> the Taiwanese <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#117:1:A>
And <,> also it would let the international uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#118:1:A>
It would it would let the other countries to know <,> that China
<,> is quite barbaric <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> in using the military force to <,>
spread its political message <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> to Taiwan for not uhm
gaining independence <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and also uhm by launching such
large-scale military exercise China <,> have spent <,> up <,> <{> <[8> about
</[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#119:1:A>
Uhm say how many <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#120:1:A>
Two billion <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#121:1:A>
It  ' s quite large amount of money <{9> <[9> <,> </[9> at and if
that China would use this kind of money to improve the <,> social condition
<{10> <[10> <,> </[10> in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#122:1:A>
It  ' ll quite uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#123:1:A>
It  ' ll quite a blessing <{11> <[11> to </[11> the Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X135:1:Z>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X136:1:Z>
But the Chinese government has to show Taiwan that <,> they do
not agree with the independence of that state <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> so they
have to do something about it <{2> <[2> probably </[2> a military exercise
would be one of the way to show Taiwan that we have the power to to take
control of everything <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X137:1:Z>
However it has some <,> counter-effect of what they want uh </X>

<$A> <[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#138:1:A>
<[2> Such as </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#139:1:A>
Yes uhm but I think uhm some peaceful <,> uhm <,> conference <{>
<[> <,> </[> between two countries would be more helpful rather than the <,>
military <,> exercise

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X140:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X141:1:Z>
Uhm well that is a good suggestion but not everybody is willing

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#142:1:A>
Or maybe after this kind of uhm threatening <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#145:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#146:1:A>
I think uh this kind of <.> milit </.> this kind of war games

Hong Kong will still go on as usual </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#151:1:A>
No <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#152:1:A>
I think it  ' s of political significance <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> on the

Well time will tell whether it is possible <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X167:1:Z>
But I doubt China will do the same thing to <,> Hong Kong or even
to have some <,,> uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X168:1:Z>
Or they will they will they will not show <,> they will not show
if Hong Kong is trying to <,> to gain some independence <{> <[> what </[> <.>
wha wha wha </.> Taiwan is trying to do I doubt <.> Chin </.> China will do
any or Chinese the Chinese government will do anything to <,> Hong Kong
because they are both interdependent and they they benefits from each other
mutually </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#169:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#170:1:A>
No how about the current issues happened in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#171:1:A>
The building of the airport and the <{1> <[1> development </[1> of
the representative government <{2> <[2> that </[2> uh Chinas would <,> want
have a a say <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> in these <,> <{4> <[4> uhm </[4> local
issues

<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X173:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X174:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X176:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X177:1:Z>
I think they should because there are still somehow like uh a
headquarter of a branch <,> <{1> <[1> so </[1> you cannot

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X178:1:Z>
It  ' s just like uh any organization

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X179:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> China </[2> being the <,> the headquarter <{3> <[3> and
Hong Kong </[3> <,> after 1997 is just a branch of <,> the organization so
the headquarter <,> now or in future the Chinese government should have some
say in <,> the local government here </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#180:1:A>
<[1> Pardon </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#181:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#182:1:A>
<[3> Headquarter </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#183:1:A>
But under the Sino-British agreement <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> it is
agreed uhm by the China and the British British <,> side that uhm higher
autonomy will be given to Hong Kong <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#184:1:A>
But why should the headquarter <,> always try to intervene <,> the
policy of Hong Kong <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#185:1:A>
Just let the Chinese <,> oh no just let the Hong Kong elite to
rule Hong Kong <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#186:1:A>
It  ' s quite possible way

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X209:1:Z>
Uh now that you are university education

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X210:1:Z>
Okay what are the a lot since you have a lot so there must be a

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#211:1:A>
<O> laugh </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#212:1:A>
Uhm <,> first of all <,> I feel that I am growing up <,> during
the <,> university life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X213:1:Z>
Growing up in what sense

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X214:1:Z>
Physically <O> both laughed </O>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X215:1:Z>
Everybody is growing up </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#216:1:A>
No <&> laugh </&> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#217:1:A>
Uhm <,> uhm how to say

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#218:1:A>
It  ' s quite difficult <,> to say <,> in a few words

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X219:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#220:1:A>
And first of all uhm <,> I have led an independent <,> life
in the university as I have moved away from my family <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> to
the mini-hall <{2> <[2> and also </[2> to <,> to the Swire Hall <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#221:1:A>
And <,> it is so happy to live without my family members <{4> <[4>
<,,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#222:1:A>
And because I can <,> do whatever I like

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#223:1:A>
I can sleep late and I can <,> uhm go to whenever <,> places that
I like <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#224:1:A>
And also uhm I have a taste of freedom <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> during
these three years  '  university life <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#225:1:A>
Uhm <,> I can <,> meet different kind of people <{8> <[8> <,>
</[8> that would give me <,> some insights <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#226:1:A>
Because uhm <,> when I was <,> a <,> year one student <{9> <[9>
<,> </[9> I was quite immature <{10> <[10> <,> </[10> in thinking my way of
life in thinking <,> how to deal with people in thinking uhm how to <,,> uhm
how to lead my university life

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#227:1:A>
I just <,> like a small potato being put in a <,> in a <,> in a
very complex and quite difficult world <{11> <[11> <,> </[11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#228:1:A>
I don't know my way <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#229:1:A>
So somebody <,> so during the visit <,> in the Swire Hall somebody
advise me to <,> think clearly what I want to do <{12> <[12> in </[12> my
university life <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#230:1:A>
At that time I <,> gave him no answer <{13> <[13> <,> </[13> as I
<,> never thought of how to live my life because in my secondary years <,>
what I had to do is just to <,> uhm pass the examination to gain high marks
in the test and to <,> uhm <,> to <,> to do my <,> homework <{14> <[14> <,>
</[14>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#231:1:A>
This life in my university is very <.> sim </.> in my in my
secondary school is very simple

I remember when I was a small boy I can't remember exactly how
old I was <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but <,> somewhere during the primary school
education <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> I start to wonder about death you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X309:1:Z>
Where do people go after they die <{3> <[3> <?> where </?> </[3>
at that age you become so scary that I had nightmares occasionally but not
very <{4> <[4> often

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X310:1:Z>
And </[4> I and I can be and I I remember I <,> I woke up in the

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X311:1:Z>
Just very frightened about death and wondering <,> where are all
those people after they die <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X312:1:Z>
And <,> however I never get an answer

come to me probably I am too busy with other things <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X314:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#327:1:A>
Yes it  ' s scary and <,> I do believe that even my parents
can't give me an answer <{> <[> <,> </[> because they are not uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#328:1:A>
They do not believe in <,> any religion

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X329:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X330:1:Z>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X331:1:Z>
Yeah <,> I guess so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#332:1:A>
It may be also a frightening question to them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X333:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#334:1:A>
When my father <,> uhm is older <,> and older <{1> <[1> and
</[1> he  ' s nearly uhm fifty-four <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#335:1:A>
And I think uhm <,> uhm <,> the old man would <,> have a problem
in facing <,> death

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X336:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X337:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X338:1:Z>
Yeah probably </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#339:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X340:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#341:1:A>
So I really want to introduce religion to him

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#342:1:A>
Uhm but I never start <,> and I never started to pray

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X343:1:Z>
<unc> two-words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X344:1:Z>
So you have to <,> I know it  ' s difficult but <,> have to give it
a try <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X345:1:Z>
Sometimes I do ask myself but I never try to do so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#346:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#347:1:A>
Because I think that uhm men would be quite uhm <,> stubborn in
believing a daughter  ' s saying <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> as <,> the <,> the man the
Chinese man would need people to respect him <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but not <,>
to introduce a new concept to him

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X348:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X349:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X350:1:Z>
Uhm <,> true <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X351:1:Z>
Yeah so hopefully God will touch him one day <,> one way or
another </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#352:1:A>
Uhm <,> yes so I should start uhm praying

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X353:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#354:1:A>
Sometimes I find that uhm uhm <,> life is so complex we have
to face our own life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X355:1:Z>
Our own problems </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#356:1:A>
Yes to face our own problems and we have to take care the
others and to think of uhm how meaningful would the other uhm lead their life
believe in God especially they are <,> my family members <,,> <&> a pause
</&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X357:1:Z>
True </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#358:1:A>
Uhm <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so we have to face the spiritual
problems <,> and also the daily life problems <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#359:1:A>
But sometimes <,> the daily life problems would uhm <,> overwhelm
<,> the spiritual problems <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#360:1:A>
Do you get my meaning

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X361:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X362:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X363:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X364:1:Z>
Yes of <{> <[> course </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#365:1:A>
<[> Because </[> </{> we are too busy with our own work

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X366:1:Z>
Yes worrying about the test the assignments <{> <[> <,> </[> the
exams </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#367:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#368:1:A>
And we seldom spare a thought <,> to God <,> to our spiritual life
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#369:1:A>
And we would be uhm very busy <,> in going around and around
meeting <,> people and develop <&> tape ends </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X370:1:Z>
<Indig> Hoi chi </indig> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#371:1:A>
Okay <,> uhm let  ' s go back to university life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X372:1:Z>
Yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X373:1:Z>
You are saying about developing interpersonal skills </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#374:1:A>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#375:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X376:1:Z>
Uhm learning to be more independent </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#377:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X378:1:Z>
<{> <[> And </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#379:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#380:1:A>
When I <,> when I first come to this university I just found it
is very <,> tantalizing <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because <,> I uhm met many
different people <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and they are very talkative <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#381:1:A>
Uhm <,> uhm at the first sight I don't know how to talk with
people <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#382:1:A>
I don't know <,> how to contact with different kind of people
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4> who would have different kinds of personalities

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#383:1:A>
And it  ' s so difficult for me to find a suitable <.> comm </.> uh
topic to discuss <,> so I feel very frustrated

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#384:1:A>
At the first <,> beginning people would say that I was <,> shy
<{5> <[5> <,> </[5> and <,> I was quiet <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#385:1:A>
And <,> true I think that it is part of my personalities but uhm
<,> because the environment is totally different from my secondary school <,>
so <,> I will be quite scared to express myself <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> and to
<,> uhm <,> talk with different kind of people I don't <,> know before <{7>
<[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#386:1:A>
So <,> I tried really very hard to open my mouth <,> and to <O>
laugh </O> and to talk with people

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#387:1:A>
And fortunately uhm <,> uhm <,> I feel I was quite <,> successful
<,> in <,> in <,> in developing a good interpersonal skills

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X388:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X389:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X390:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X391:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X392:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X393:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X394:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X395:1:Z>
So how did you overcome that problem then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#396:1:A>
Uhm <{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X397:1:Z>
<[> You are saying </[> </{> that it  ' s very difficult to start a
conversation so how do you overcome that problem </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#398:1:A>
Uhm it needs time to practise so I would try bit by bit to
talk with uhm different kind of people <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and <,> and <,>
and I would uhm remember <,> uhm their problems <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> or <,>
their experience and then when next time I see them I would try to uhm <,>
uhm <,> say

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X399:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X400:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X401:1:Z>
Ask them how are they getting on </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#402:1:A>
Yes so we

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X403:1:Z>
Do you do you remember them deliberately you know <,> just </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#404:1:A>
Yes at the very <,> beginning I remembered <,> the hallmates  ' 
life and experience

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X405:1:Z>
Uhm but do you <,> go and remember each individual  ' s problem
deliberately <,> you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X406:1:Z>
Just on purpose <{> <[> so that you </[> can start a conversation
later </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#407:1:A>
<[> On purpose </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#408:1:A>
Yes at the very <,> first beginning <{> <[> <,> I </[> did so
because

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X409:1:Z>
<[> Oh no </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X410:1:Z>
I think that is very stressful okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#411:1:A>
No because you know that in <{1> <[1> my </[1> secondary  ' s
<,> life I don't know how to contact to with people

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#412:1:A>
I just uhm would bury my head into the books <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
and study and study and study and it  ' s <,> it  ' s really very difficult <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#413:1:A>
And I will try my very best to say hello to each one <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> to say good morning <,> so as to <,> uhm <,> to look like friendly <{4>
<[4> <,> </[4> but truly I I I am friendly

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#414:1:A>
I don't <.> di </.> pretend it <{5> <[5> to be friendly </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#415:1:A>
So uhm I  ' ll uhm take the initiative to enter the other floormates  ' 
room <,> to have a chat <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#416:1:A>
And <,> even though <,> it looks like uhm <,> simple daily life to
enter the other one  ' s <.> li </.> to to enter the other <,> one  ' s <.> ro
</.> room <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#417:1:A>
It  ' s really a big task for me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X418:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X419:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X420:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X421:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X422:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm okay </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X423:1:Z>
Oh okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#424:1:A>
So later <,> I <,,> uhm <,> I adapted to this kind of
environment and people <,> so <,> uhm eventually <,> I succeed in building up
some kind of close friendships with some friends <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and I
tried to participate in other kind of extra-curricular activities such as the
leadership <,> and life skill course <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#425:1:A>
And at that <,> place the counselor would give us <,> good advice

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X426:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X427:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X428:1:Z>
About what </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#429:1:A>
About uhm <,> about uhm <,> how to <,> express your <,>
opinion <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#430:1:A>
How to <,> uhm <,> how to <,,> work with the other people <,> and
what is the group dynamic <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#431:1:A>
Uhm <,> uh when we do a project together <,> so we know <,> uh in
a meeting how to conduct the <,> the message <,> and how to respond <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#432:1:A>
It is a so <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#433:1:A>
It is a very good training

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X434:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X435:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X436:1:Z>
Uhm <,> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X437:1:Z>
I think you have mentioned <,> many times that the training was
<,> excellent </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#438:1:A>
Uhm <{1> <[1> yes </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#439:1:A>
And I started to think <,> more about life <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
since that course <,> so <,> in my <,> <.> s </.> year two <,> I <,> was the
leader of social services group <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> and it was a great
challenge to me <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> because I have to be a leader to lead a
team of sixty members <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#440:1:A>
And before that I was quite shy <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> at Swire Hall
and suddenly <,> I was elevated to be a leader

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X441:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X442:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X443:1:Z>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X444:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X445:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X446:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X447:1:Z>
Well I think you are very impressive </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#448:1:A>
Really

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X449:1:Z>
That  ' s how I remember you yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#450:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X451:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#452:1:A>
I  ' ve tried my very best to <,> express my <{1> <[1> opinion
</[1> to <?> contact </?> the meeting <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and to apply the
theory which I have learned in the leadership <{3> <[3> course </[3> into
practice <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> so I  ' ll be very uhm <,> say uhm <,> careful
<{5> <[5> <,> </[5> about my <,> personal growth <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#453:1:A>
So I really <,> uhm seize the chance <,> to develop myself <{7>
<[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#454:1:A>
And after that year I found I was quite successful <{8> <[8> <,>
</[8> <,> and I became more confident <,> and I <,> become uhm more
open-minded <{9> <[9> <,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#455:1:A>
And it is easier for me to talk with the others <{10> <[10> <,>
</[10> because I can contact different kind of staff at different kind of
centres <{11> <[11> <,> </[11> and also to communicate different kind of
hallmates <{12> <[12> <,> </[12> so as to <,> uhm proceed the <,> social
services <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#456:1:A>
So I really <,> gained a lot <{13> <[13> <,> </[13> in year two

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X457:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

Yeah so year three </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#471:1:A>
Year three <O> laugh </O> and I moved <,> to a miniflat <{>
<[> <,,> </[> and I found my life was <,> peaceful <,> and quiet and I do
enjoy that kind of life <,> cos I can concentrate on my studies <,> and I can
uhm <,> put more time in <,> <.> doin </.> doing my own <,> personal business

Yes because <,> some uhm I know part of the answer <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#489:1:A>
Maturity is to uhm <,> is to <,> say <,> concern the other people  ' s
needs <{2> <[2> and </[2> to uhm <,> take care of the other one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X490:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X491:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X492:1:Z>
True

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X493:1:Z>
A mature person not only <,> able to take care of others but you
must first be able to take care of yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#494:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X495:1:Z>
You can't even take care of yourself how can you take care of
others </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#496:1:A>
That means we have to know what way we have to go <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#497:1:A>
What we have to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#498:1:A>
How to <?> handle </?> our own problems mentally and <,> <?> let
me say </?> so physically is it right <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> because we have to
take care of our <{3> <[3> <,> body </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X499:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X500:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X501:1:Z>
<[3> Okay yeah correct </[3> </{3> so the basic needs of life <{>
<[> <,> </[> food clothings <,> shelter </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#502:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#503:1:A>
And also sports

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X504:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> So I think I can take care of myself <{> <[> <,> </[> physically <,>
very well <O> laugh </O> but not mentally sometimes

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#505:1:A>
You see I I always can't uhm <,> handle pressure and stress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X506:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X507:1:Z>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X508:1:Z>
Pressure when when the exam is near when there  ' s lots of
assignments </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#509:1:A>
Yes and also I have to face the another kind of life after my
graduation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X510:1:Z>
Oh don't worry that  ' s part uhm parts of life

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X511:1:Z>
You definitely meet problems <,> as you go along <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X512:1:Z>
If you don't don't if you if you don't meet any problems you will
not grow <,> <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X513:1:Z>
As </[> you see more problems <,> when you are able to handle
with them slowly you  ' ll learn <,> something out of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X514:1:Z>
It  ' s just that sometimes you don't realize that you are learning
something out of it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#515:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#516:1:A>
Uhm so when <.> tha </.> when we overcome the problem <,> and we
<,> turn our head back <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> we can see oh the problem is over
and I have learned <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> something and <,> and I would like to
say that God has <,> helped me <,> to overcome the problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X517:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X518:1:Z>
<[2> Something </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X519:1:Z>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X520:1:Z>
Well if being a being a Christian of course you will always <,>
uh say that yes God has helped <{1> <[1> you right </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X521:1:Z>
If from a non-Christian point of view <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> they
would say that oh through their personal effort through their personal uh <,>
ability they are able to solve the problem themselves </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#522:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#523:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#524:1:A>
Or would they think that <,> they have finally <,> muddled through
the problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X525:1:Z>
Well <,> could be another way of <.> s </.> seeing it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#526:1:A>
Uhm <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but it  ' s quite pessimistic <,> <{2>
<[2> to say </[2> so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X527:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X528:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X529:1:Z>
But that it all depends on that <,> that individual  ' s attitudes
towards life <{> <[> <,> </[> yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X530:1:Z>
Some people thinks life is short <,> be happy <,> whenever you
can <,> and <,> problem is <,> forever-coming

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X531:1:Z>
One problem is over another problem will arise <,> then when you
solve this problem <,> another problem comes so you got to tackle the new
problem <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X532:1:Z>
When this <.> ne ne </.> when this new problem becomes an old
problem <,> then when you solve it another problem comes so it  ' s it  ' s just
the cycle of life </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-022#533:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#534:1:A>
So that  ' s life full of us unexpected challenges <{> <[> <,> </[>
problems

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-022#X535:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{> </X> </I>
