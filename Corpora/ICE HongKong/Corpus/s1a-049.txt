<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#1:1:A>
Standard

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X2:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#3:1:A>
Uhm it  ' s not very good I can say especially the economist

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#4:1:A>
The the lecturer is from Korea

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X5:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#6:1:A>
And he I think that he just know some superficial knowledge
about Economics

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#7:1:A>
Actually he  ' s majored in Statistics philosophy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X8:1:Z>
Right right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#9:1:A>
So but its okay for me because I I I haven't learnt Economics
before in secondary school <{> <[> <,> so </[> I just know what that is
necessary for examinations

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#10:1:A>
That  ' s enough

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X11:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X12:1:Z>
The Hong Kong education uh philosophy <{> <[> yes </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X13:1:Z>
Uh uh when I was in university you know there were lecturers we
were just we wee just warned against just told that they have the same
lectures for fifty years

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X14:1:Z>
You know and no intention of changing them were you now there were
references in these lectures to uh politicians who were dead you know and
other lectures were wonderful

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X15:1:Z>
And we went to them even if we not in their in their subject

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X16:1:Z>
So for example the the Fine Arts lecturers were very very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X17:1:Z>
And if I could I went to their lectures but I wasn't studying the
subject </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#18:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#19:1:A>
Yes <{1> <[1> we </[1> we can also go go to sit-in <.> le lec </.>
lecture room to listen to <.> le </.> lecturers <{2> <[2> <,> but </[2> I
have no interest in in that subjects in other subjects

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#20:1:A>
Rather than I was like E P A majors

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X21:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X22:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X23:1:Z>
Yeah I I think that uhm if something is difficult to understand
than you should approach it historically because uh it became difficult
gradually

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X24:1:Z>
It went from simple to complex and you  ' re you  ' re the end of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X25:1:Z>
You  ' re trying to understand the complex

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X26:1:Z>
So if you went to for example economic history lectures and you
just you you then you would understand how the economy of the world developed
into the the present stage

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X27:1:Z>
And it might help you understand uhm the modern economy of the
world

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X28:1:Z>
It might not

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X29:1:Z>
I I I have thought that to be helpful you know when there is
something I don't understand try try to read the history of the subject you
know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#30:1:A>
Yeah that  ' s good but I just don't <&> tut </&> uh I still
can't find a subject that I  ' m I  ' m really interested in

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X31:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#32:1:A>
So I  ' m I  ' m just you know <?> crossing them cross path </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X33:1:Z>
Yes so you gets you instead of concentrating one subject you
choose the subjects that help you understand the world

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X34:1:Z>
The economic it  ' s an important one

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X35:1:Z>
You know I I think uh politicians can tell us so many lies because
we don't understand Economics <{> <[> <,> you know </[> and if something
happens that  ' s bad it is not our fault it  ' s the world recession

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X36:1:Z>
And something happen it  ' s good this is all out all our all our
credit

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X37:1:Z>
We raise <unc> a few words </unc> no body knows

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X38:1:Z>
We cant  '  we can't judge these statements but I can

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X39:1:Z>
So I think Economics is an important term

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X40:1:Z>
Do you think it  ' s a science field </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#41:1:A>
<[> Like price </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#42:1:A>
Science

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X43:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X44:1:Z>
Do you think it you know it gives us knowledge the way that
science gives us knowledge

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X45:1:Z>
Or <.> econo </.> economists just guessing </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#46:1:A>
Yeah I think both of them are guessing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X47:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#48:1:A>
Because science you know the the theories can be uhm <.> pu
</.> pull down by any other person <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> any time <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> so all the things in the world are just guest

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X49:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X50:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X51:1:Z>
Yes but uhm there is much more agreement among scientists than
there are than there is among economists surely

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X52:1:Z>
I mean scientists agreed that water boiled at a hundred degrees
and <unc> two-words </unc> vessels at at sea level <.> Ec </.>
economists don't even <{> <[> agree </[> about about the most basic things in
the subject I think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#53:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#54:1:A>
Yes that  ' s why I I think Economics is <&> tut </&> is really hard
to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X55:1:Z>
Uhm <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#56:1:A>
<[> Especially </[> </{> I don't get have the basic knowledge
in this subject

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#57:1:A>
Anyway next year I will not study <.> Economi </.> Economics
anymore

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X58:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#59:1:A>
So I just <&> tut </&> I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X60:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#61:1:A>
I just <&> tut </&> study it for for the examination

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X62:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X63:1:Z>
Uhm what sport and facilities and </X>

<{> <[> You need both </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#67:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#68:1:A>
Yeah there are swimming pools <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and uh badminton
courts

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#69:1:A>

<[2> So which one do you </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X73:1:Z>
Which ones do you do

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X74:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#77:1:A>
You know I have lessons all the time

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#78:1:A>
Everyday I have many lessons

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X79:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#80:1:A>
I can see my time table here

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#81:1:A>
Poor me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X82:1:Z>
What  ' s it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X83:1:Z>
Oh God <unc> a few words </unc> school

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X84:1:Z>
So when when do you go to the library </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#85:1:A>
Library

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X86:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#87:1:A>
Just in sometimes I have some uh time left before two lessons
but this period I I will go to the library just to study not to read the
books cos

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X88:1:Z>
Well this this isn't like my experience of university

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X89:1:Z>
You know my experience of university was very very few lectures
and seminars and and <.> al </.> always essays and always working in the
library to work essays

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X90:1:Z>
You know every week we had somebody had to deliver a little talk
to a seminar or tutorial group

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X91:1:Z>
And you would always prepare in one of these and you would always
writing a long essay for somebody

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X92:1:Z>
But uhm we didn't have lessons

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X93:1:Z>
This is like school </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#94:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#95:1:A>
It  ' s like secondary schools

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X96:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#97:1:A>
Especially for me because uh other students in the same course
but they uhm are with different <.> lec </.> lecturers

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X98:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#99:1:A>
So they have presentations to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#100:1:A>
They have projects to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#101:1:A>
But so far I haven't got any in any of this kind of assignment

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#102:1:A>
I just attend the <{> <[> lessons </[> and read the books and do
the homeworks

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#103:1:A>
That  ' s all

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X104:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X105:1:Z>
Well you don't know if you are making progress or not then

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X106:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#110:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#126:1:A>
But I I think next semester I will have more things to do and
that  ' s will be interesting <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> cos I know that next semester
we will going to have uh case studies in <.> st </.> statistics

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#127:1:A>
It  ' s something like logic <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and you will have
to discuss with a group of people <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> to and then to <&> tut
</&> to do a project and use the computer <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> to calculate
the datas <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#128:1:A>

A business a business office yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X148:1:Z>
You know it will it will probably make a lot of what the talking
about a lot more you know understandable if if you if you are with people
whoa re actually doing the job

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X149:1:Z>
And saw how they did it and saw what they talked about and solve
the problems where <{> <[> <,> you know </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#150:1:A>
<[> Yeah but </[> </{> we are just year one students

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#151:1:A>
We we don't have much chance to meet these kind of people

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#152:1:A>
And the won't let us to get in their office to get that working
experience so so early

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X153:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#154:1:A>
May be next year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X155:1:Z>
May be yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X156:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Just theory is boring </[1> isn't it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X157:1:Z>
You know practice can be interesting but <{2> <[2> theory </[2>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#158:1:A>
<[1> <unc> two-words </unc> yet </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#159:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> yes <{1> <[1> so </[1> I I attend an English
course lesson

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#160:1:A>
Actually it offers you no credits <{2> <[2> <,> you </[2> mean you
know what credit means

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X161:1:Z>
<[> It </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X162:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X163:1:Z>
<{> <[> No </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#164:1:A>
<[1> In </[1> </{1> CU we have a we have to study for three
<{> <[> years </[> before you graduate <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and you have to
get ninety-nine credits before you graduate in these three years

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X165:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X166:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X167:1:Z>
Ninety-ninety </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#168:1:A>
Ninety-nine yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#169:1:A>
<{1  <[1 So  </[1 every subject offers give you about  three to
four credits

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#170:1:A>
This term I I have I  ' ll have to get twenty credits <{2 
<[2 that  means  </[2  


 

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X171:1:Z>
<[1  <?> Uh Jesus </?> </[1  </{1  
 
 

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X172:1:Z>
<[2 I find  </[2  </{2 it hard to credit that and oh well  </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#173:1:A>
But I think this course it  ' s interesting so I <{> <[> I I
enroll it </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X174:1:Z>
<[> We well we needed nine </[> </{> uhm and if we did fairly
well we didn't have to sit the exam </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#175:1:A>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X176:1:Z>
Yeah if if our if our credits and our if we got the very very
well for our uhm tutorial papers and the essays you know you could be given a
pass without sitting the exam </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#177:1:A>
But I think without examination that will be a little unfair
because some students will just copy from their classmates

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#178:1:A>
Don't you think this <&> tut </&> <{> <[> something </[> is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X179:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> shouldn't shouldn't really <{> <[> be possible
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X180:1:Z>
There  ' s a but it depends how you feel about uhm some some some
subjects don't link themselves to objective assessment you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X317:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> we we about eighty of us came to Hong Kong at

No we <{> <[> came </[> we came as a group yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X323:1:Z>
This is before I came the Cheung Pak Sha

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X324:1:Z>
I went to Valtorta in Tai Po </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#325:1:A>
<[> Aw </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#326:1:A>
Valtorta

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X327:1:Z>
Yeah <{> <[> uh </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#328:1:A>
<[> Is </[> </{> that a secondary school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X329:1:Z>
Yes <.> Cath </.> Catholic Roman Catholic religious school </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#330:1:A>
So why did you change it to this school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X331:1:Z>
I didn't like Voltorta

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X332:1:Z>
It was uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X333:1:Z>
There was a very bad staff meeting actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X334:1:Z>
Uhm you know there there was a a staff meeting where the staff
was all was asked to get into groups and and write down their wishes of their
plans for Valtorta etcetera

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X335:1:Z>
Then and then write them on blackboards

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X336:1:Z>
And one member of my group wrote on the blackboard I would like
Valtorta College to be more open <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and the Head Master said
nothing at that time but he photographed this

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X337:1:Z>
He took a photograph of this blackboard and then he called
another staff meeting

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X338:1:Z>
This this first staff meeting had been conducted by our Roman
Catholic uhm bishops sort of perhaps I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X339:1:Z>
But anyway he called another staff meeting just for the just in
the school

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X340:1:Z>
And his and he held up the the photograph <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> of
the and said who wrote these words

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X341:1:Z>
And no nobody said anything and then he stared going round

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X342:1:Z>
Did you write this

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X343:1:Z>
Is this your hand-writing

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X344:1:Z>
And than uhm the person one person put up his hand and said it  ' s
not my hand-writing but it  ' s my feeling <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X345:1:Z>
And uh then the staff meeting then continued in Chinese that I
didn't understand the rest of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X346:1:Z>
I decided then that I didn't want to work in that environment but
I did realize the environment was typical that I thought Valtorta was unusual

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X347:1:Z>
It  ' s is the same everywhere </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#348:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#349:1:A>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#350:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#351:1:A>
So it  ' s bad luck for <{> <[> you in </[> Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X352:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X353:1:Z>
Uh uhm also it was uhm the <.> bes </.> beside the school was
huge a huge building site and had one year of continue <?> painting </?> and
they are going to continue for one more year and the <?> painting </?> I
thought make teaching impossible

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X354:1:Z>
You know because of uh many many <unc> one-word </unc>
drivers you know and not just one but many so so you'e getting one of these
palms yon know every every few seconds

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X355:1:Z>
I hate it uh it  ' s impossible

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X356:1:Z>
The school was not air-conditioned at all so you had to have the
windows open

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X357:1:Z>
And uh and sometimes you just you just wrote on the blackboard
and the student copied because teach talking to them <{1> <[1> at the end of
the </[1> afternoon you know you  ' ll the voice was was gone from shouting so
<{2> <[2> much </[2> and the students were no longer able to concentrate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#358:1:A>
<[1> <unc> a few words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#359:1:A>
<[2> Oh no </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#360:1:A>
Where is that school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X361:1:Z>
Right beside the the KCR lane

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X362:1:Z>
So when the KCR leaves Tai Po and goes to Tai Wo there was uh
there was grass on the right hand side and you can just see a high building
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#363:1:A>
Oh I see

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X364:1:Z>
It  ' s that school

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X365:1:Z>
I don't know the Chinese name

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X366:1:Z>
Uhm it was terrible </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#367:1:A>
So the environment here is you know <{> <[> at least it  ' s
better </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X368:1:Z>
<[> Well until they started here </[> </{> the environment was a
lot better yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X369:1:Z>
But uhm what what I don't like here is lunch time

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X370:1:Z>
You know there there is no where I can go to get a uhm just a
just a Western snack

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X371:1:Z>
So in in Valtorta there were many places

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X372:1:Z>
You know there is a big shopping mall and there is a Pizza Hut
and a Spaghetti House and the Kentucky Fried Chicken

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X373:1:Z>
<{> <[> I <unc> a few words </unc> </[> the junk food

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X374:1:Z>
But here so I I just don't bother with lunch here I just uhm I
just walked through the lunch hour and find that that means I have another
hour and a half at night you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#375:1:A>
<[> Here is <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#376:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X379:1:Z>
<{> <[> Usually </[> no

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X380:1:Z>
And now I find that the that that the the lunch time is useful
walking time because the staff room is quiet and I can get a lot done you
know so it  ' s good </X>

<$A> <[> You </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#381:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X395:1:Z>
<.> Ac </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X396:1:Z>
Actually there is a student a a teacher rather who is supposed to
be my interpreter <{> <[> but </[> uh well you know he  ' s he  ' s Van Van
Dickson </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#397:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#398:1:A>
Oh I see he  ' s a

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X399:1:Z>
And so my previous interpreter was John Law the Physics teacher
<{> <[> <,> </[> who went to Canada </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#400:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#401:1:A>
Oh I see

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X402:1:Z>
And he was he was very conscientious

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X403:1:Z>
He he he perform his duty very well he wrote everything he just
it was like <{> <[> dictation he </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#404:1:A>
<[> You know </[> </{> he  ' s always telling us that he  ' s is
proud of his English standard <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and he said that many <.>
En </.> uhm foreign friends <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> say that he speak good
English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X405:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X406:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#407:1:Z>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#408:1:A>
He  ' s very proud of that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X409:1:Z>
So he he covered up these sheets with English and passed them to
me to read </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#410:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X411:1:Z>
And it <{> <[> was </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#412:1:A>
<[> Very </[> </{> helpful

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X413:1:Z>
It was no it was rubbish

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X414:1:Z>
Well his English was good but I I get would the sheet so uhm uh
toilet paper consumption has increased by twenty-five percent on the course
of this uh <unc> one-word </unc> the the school officers reluctantly
actually to ration the the toilet paper

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X415:1:Z>
But uh if if teachers are not more economical uhm they they will
to be rationed you know one roll each per term

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X416:1:Z>
I said John it  ' s all right I don't want to leave

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X417:1:Z>
And then uhm one one one was one was terrible

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X418:1:Z>
Once was uh the Principal had been walking the school and he was
shocked by some of the behaviour that he was seeing as he looked through the
the <{> <[> door and </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#419:1:A>
<[> Yeah I know that </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X420:1:Z>
And one one uh example that shocked him greatly was that in uh
John Law  ' s Physics lesson you know a form seven student <{> <[> had </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#421:1:A>
<[> My </[> </{> class

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X422:1:Z>
No previous <{> <[> form </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#423:1:A>
<[> Form seven </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X424:1:Z>
Previous form seven <{> <[> class </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#425:1:A>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X426:1:Z>
Uh Michael Chang Margaret uhm Lun Man Yee Joyce was <unc>
one-word </unc> that that that class uhm was drinking had his drinking
water out <{> <[> of </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#427:1:A>
<[> Water </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X428:1:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X429:1:Z>
And the the teacher should know that that eating and drinking in
classroom was strongly forbidden

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X430:1:Z>
So he had to write this uhm denunciation himself you know and
pass it to him

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X431:1:Z>
So then I then John Law was was went to Canada and I said that I
asked if I could have Dickson as my my uhm translator

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X432:1:Z>
So that now the staff meetings are more better

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X433:1:Z>
I have a little bit of chest problems and I studied my chest
problems and at the end I said what was discussed and he said bull shit and
that  ' s the extent of my uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#434:1:A>
Perhaps <?> cannot </?> speak in in that meeting it  ' s better
for you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X435:1:Z>
Uh yes I <{> <[> think </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#436:1:A>
<[> As </[> </{> you don't have to <{> <[> listen </[> the
rubbish

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X437:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X438:1:Z>
I  ' m glad

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X439:1:Z>
I  ' m glad

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X440:1:Z>
And then may be six months later the the minutes are distributed
in English <{> <[> <,> and </[> that I see that Dickson was right

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X441:1:Z>
And I must <unc> one-word </unc> there  ' s nothing

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X442:1:Z>
Uhm but what I I don't mind the main staff meetings because these
are for everybody and I don't mind the the assembly because we are there to
make a kind of ceremony for the students but it  ' s the occasional staff
meetings they are often for one one p m in the Geography room

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X443:1:Z>
And there  ' s may be once every two weeks

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X444:1:Z>
And Mr Liu and Mr Kwong will rattle at the students and the
teachers

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X445:1:Z>
I think I shouldn't have to go to these

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X446:1:Z>
You know a teacher had been just come out of these and tell me
what what was said

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X447:1:Z>
And I often have to cancel my own class because of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X448:1:Z>
And I think it  ' s a complete waste of

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X449:1:Z>
The school uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#450:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#451:1:A>
How often do they meet

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X452:1:Z>
About once every two weeks

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X453:1:Z>
Usually once a fortnight </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#454:1:A>
Once a week

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X455:1:Z>
No they usually on average every two weeks there will be a { >
<[> <,> you </[> just impromptu one announced that morning

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X456:1:Z>
So I came in the morning and I see that it written up on the
notice board that staff meeting geography room ten past one

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X457:1:Z>
And I I usually think that this could just be a <unc>
one-word </unc> you know the whole thing the staff never never see
anything

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X458:1:Z>
The staff are all may be audience </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#460:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X461:1:Z>
The the Principal Mr Ho Mr Yue and then other teachers give
reports uh prefect studies discipline and so on

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X462:1:Z>
But the whole thing could be written down and photocopied and
send to us

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X463:1:Z>
We just need the minutes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X464:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#583:2:A>
<{> <[> The Fugitive </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X584:2:Z>
<[> Yeah I </[> </{> see I saw the Fugitive

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X585:2:Z>
I actually I like it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X586:2:Z>
Did you like it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X587:2:Z>
Did you see it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#588:2:A>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X589:2:Z>
Did you see it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#590:2:B>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X591:2:Z>
It was pretty good uhm but I was it was more predictable <{1>
<[1> and </[1> it  ' s not as <{2> <[2> deep </[2> I think the storyline is
more superficial </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#592:2:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#593:2:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#594:2:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X595:2:Z>
Oh was was the Schindler  ' s List was a very long movie wasn't it
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#596:2:A>
Yes more than three hours

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#597:2:B>
Uh huh I know that this is this is <.> mo </.> this movie is
about the Nazi Nazi <{> <[> camp </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#598:2:B>
Is it frightening but

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#599:2:A>
<[> Camp </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#600:2:A>
Uh yes because I have studied history in <{1> <[1> my </[1>
secondary so I  ' ve known some background about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#601:2:A>
Uhm but uh it  ' s not so violent because you you just see some the
Jewish people are shot <&> tut </&> the <.> Gem Gem </.> German there  ' s not
<.> s </.> uh many bloody scenes <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but the feeling you can
get is uhm <&> tut </&> it  ' s very sad because you you you see the little
children they uh hide themselves under the bed and in <&> tut </&> in the uh
sewage and husbands and wives are are separated

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#602:2:A>
<{3> <[3> <,> Uhm </[3> and it is because because they are very
young and they are just like ordinary people like mot of us <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4> and it is I I think it  ' s strange to see have experienced those kind of
things

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#603:2:A>
They are uhm <&> tut </&> children uh teenagers and ordinary
people

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#604:2:A>
And and I can remember the one uhm that one one speech spoken by
one of the uhm German killers and and a girl witness that he killed a <.> peo
</.> a pedestrian just passed by

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#605:2:A>
And she said that woman was not uhm fatter was not taller was not
shorter or any kind

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#606:2:A>
Just just an ordinary woman passing by

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#607:2:A>
And I don't know why that German people shot shot her

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#608:2:A>
So and that girl the Nazi people was the servant in I that German
troop killer

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#609:2:A>
And she was very afraid that one day she will become one of the
<{5> <[5> victims </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#610:2:A>


<ICE-HK:S1A-049#611:2:A>
<{6> <[6> And </[6> and I I cannot imagine that when I was one of
those people <{7> <[7> I  ' ve </[7> been live in uh fear everyday

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#612:2:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#613:2:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#614:2:B>

<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#618:2:B>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#619:2:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#620:2:B>
Actually I have been to Poland last <{> <[> summer </[> I have
visit uhm one Nazi camp

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#621:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#622:2:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#623:2:B>
And I  ' m really frightened by <{> <[> the </[> atmosphere
there

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#624:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X625:2:Z>
It  ' s it  ' s black and white isn't it <{> <[> for </[> most of the
film </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#626:2:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#627:2:B>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X628:2:Z>
Did you find that <.> wa </.> was hard to follow because it is
black and white or was the effects better </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#629:2:A>
No because it  ' s more like the the real the real situation
because you see some is it <.> doc </.> call documentary <{> <[> or </[> <{1>
<[1> documentary </[1> films always always in black and white

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#630:2:A>
And I think it is a very a very thoughtful way of expressing uh
the uh Director  ' s uh expression is that uhm the camera is always uh in in
some situation they shake just like uhm <&> tut </&> the reporter running
around to to catch the scene And it makes uh the movie become more real <{2>
<[2> uhm </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#631:2:A>
And I I saw In the Name of the Father too and I find it very
moving

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X632:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X633:2:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#635:2:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#636:2:A>
Have you see <{> <[> it </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X637:2:Z>
<[> I </[> </{> I have seen it too </X>

<{> <[> Uhm </[> how do you find it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#639:2:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#640:2:B>
I I just like it

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#641:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X642:2:Z>
What is it about I haven't I haven't seen it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#643:2:A>
And it  ' s about uh I think it  ' s uh mainly about the scandal
of the British Government or British the <.> po </.> uh the police

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#644:2:A>
And because uh <&> tut </&> <{> <[> there  ' s </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#645:2:B>
<[> And </[> </{> I think it reveals the corrupted side <{>
<[> <.> ille </.> of legal system </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X646:2:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#647:2:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#648:2:A>
Not just the British one

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#649:2:A>
And uhm the main character was the was the Irish people

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#650:2:A>
<{1> <[1> <,> And </[1> they are uh <&> tut </&> very ordinary or
discriminated because they do not have proper jobs and just playing around
and uhm some of them are thief and they take drugs

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#651:2:A>
And they want to escape from the terrible situation in in Ireland
and they went to Britain

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#652:2:A>
I I think the movie is I I think the because it is a true story
And it was happened <.> a </.> about

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#653:2:A>
Do you remember the the time <{2> <[2> it happen </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#654:2:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#655:2:B>
<[2> No </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#656:2:A>
<.> About twenty years ago I think Uhm <&> tut </&> the main
character uh is the name jerry and he he met some people in in Britain and
suddenly there was a bomb uhm <&> tut </&> in one of the bar <{1> <[1> I
</[1> think it  ' s a bar

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#657:2:A>
And Jerry and and his friends was accused that they have uhm they
are the terrorists

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#658:2:A>
And so they were uhm taken to the court and threatened by the
policemen by using some violent means and and police threatened to harm his
father

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#659:2:A>
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1> And so he signed the agreement I think uh not
agreement the confession that uh he has done done done that thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#660:2:A>
And the four people has uh went to prison for twelve years was he
was sentenced to <{2> <[2> fifteen </[2> years but after twelve years uhm
they were the <{2> <[2> it was </[2> cancelled

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#X661:2:Z>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#662:2:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#663:2:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<[2> Release </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-049#665:2:A>
Yes <{> <[> <.> dis </.> </[> dismissed

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#666:2:A>
And the main theme of the movie was about uhm the Jerry  ' s father
and he went to prison voluntary to uhm <&> tut </&> accompany his son

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#667:2:A>
And this I I saw just critic about this uh movie

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#668:2:A>
Because In the Name of the Father has I think is two meaning

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#669:2:A>
The first meaning is uhm it  ' s like uhm <&> tut </&> some religion
uh in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit and just like
some uhm uh hope that will be a justice <{> <[> But </[> actually there  ' s
not in not just in the movie so it  ' s quite ironic to use this name

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#670:2:A>
And the other name is to uhm illustrate the uh relation between
the father and the son

<ICE-HK:S1A-049#671:2:A>
The love between them
