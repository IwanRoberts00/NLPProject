<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X3:1:Z>
What are you going to play </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#4:1:A>
Well I haven't really though about it yet

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#5:1:A>
You know sometimes I just go in sit down look at the crowds and see
<,> what kind of crowd I have and then I just play whatever I like

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X6:1:Z>
So you take requests </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#7:1:A>
Not if they don't give me a three hundred buck tip <&> Z  ' s
unclear speech overlaps with A  ' s laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#8:1:A>
There was one time that there was this one guy <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#9:1:A>
Actually only two weeks ago there was just one guy who came round to
me and he looked very pleased and he will he said he enjoyed my music very
much <,> and he gave me a ten dollar tip

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X10:1:Z>
Oh gee what an insult

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X11:1:Z>
What do you mean are you are you are you are are you I mean it
must be hotel policy that you are not supposed to take tips anyway </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#12:1:A>
Yeah that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#13:1:A>
I don't I don't work for tips anyway but you know sometimes when
people really insist on giving me a tip even if it  ' s ten dollars I still
give them a plain smile say thank you very much <{> <[> <unc> one-word
</unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X14:1:Z>
<[> I think </[> </{> if someone give me ten dollars as a tip for
playing music or am I just give back and say you must need this more than
than I do </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#15:1:A>
Well I think you  ' ll never know

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#16:1:A>
These people will come back and they will see you again and you
don't want to offend them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#17:1:A>
That  ' s okay with me

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#18:1:A>
It  ' s part of the business

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X19:1:Z>
Yes so and so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#20:1:A>
In my opinion

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X21:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#22:1:A>
There was one time there was this one guy who gave me a five
dollar <{> <[> <,> coin and asked me </[> is there anywhere to put a tip

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X23:1:Z>
<[> Huh gee </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X24:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X25:1:Z>
Oh uhm musicians get no respect </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#26:1:A>
Well it  ' s not true

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#27:1:A>
There  ' s some very nice people

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#28:1:A>
It doesn't really matter very much to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#29:1:A>
You know like if they give me a tip or not or if they give me big
tip or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#30:1:A>
You know there are just some very nice <.> inter </.> interesting
people that I played for <,> and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X31:1:Z>
Come on

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X32:1:Z>
You don't really feel that way </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#33:1:A>
I do sometimes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X34:1:Z>
Give me a break

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X35:1:Z>
They  ' re just the audience

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X36:1:Z>
They don't know anything about music </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#37:1:A>
That  ' s not true

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#38:1:A>
<{> <[> There was one time </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X39:1:Z>
<[> They usually </[> </{> remarkably ignorant about music </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#40:1:A>
Uhm they could be ignorant but they have ears

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#41:1:A>
They hear

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#42:1:A>
I mean they don't have to know what you play

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#43:1:A>
They don't have to know know know whether you are brilliant in the
technique or not but they listen to you play and they enjoy it and just stay
and then they  ' re listening some of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#44:1:A>
<{> <[> I thought </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X45:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> I guess </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#46:1:A>
And actually sometimes you never know <,> that there are
people who really know music

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#47:1:A>
There was one time that there was this guy <,,> very good looking
guy <,> sitting there with a <.> ce </.> cello right next to him

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#48:1:A>
And it turned up he played in some international symphony orchestra

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X49:1:Z>
Which one do you remember </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#50:1:A>
I don't remember

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#51:1:A>
I only remember he was quite good looking

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#52:1:A>
And there was another time that there was this woman who came up to
me <,> and told that she really enjoyed my music <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#53:1:A>
I said thank you

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#54:1:A>
And she said uh no I really I really mean it

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#55:1:A>
I run some kind of a opera house in in London <,> <{> <[> <,> </[>
and I listen to lots of

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X56:1:Z>
<[> Huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X57:1:Z>
Some kind of opera house in London </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#58:1:A>
Uhm well uh yeah come on just leave <{> <[> it </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X59:1:Z>
<[> Are there </[> </{> are there many different kinds of opera
houses in London

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X60:1:Z>
Is it like a like a old opera house or uh Chinese opera house

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X61:1:Z>
What sort of opera house is it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#62:1:A>
Oh well just opera house okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#63:1:A>
Uhm uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X64:1:Z>
I think she was pulling your leg </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#65:1:A>
No

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X66:1:Z>
No I don't really

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X67:1:Z>
So after all these see how many years has it been now

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X68:1:Z>
It  ' s been <,,> a year and some months two years and some months
<{> <[> <,> </[> since you you quit your job and and became a full-time
musician </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#69:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#70:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X71:1:Z>
Is it good

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X72:1:Z>
You glad you did it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#73:1:A>
Uh <,> I think it was a very good decision <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#74:1:A>
I mean it was it  ' s something that I always wanted to do <,> but I
just never thought it was a wise thing to do <,,> because it seemed to me
that music wasn't a very secure job

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#75:1:A>
It  ' s still not secure you know I just go <?> on the <{> <[> two
month </?> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X76:1:Z>
<[> But you  ' ve done </[> </{> quite well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#77:1:A>
That  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#78:1:A>
I  ' ve been lucky <{> <[> to </[> a very great extent

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X79:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X80:1:Z>
Of luck but you  ' ve done quite well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#81:1:A>
That  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#82:1:A>
So I  ' ll keep doing it and see how it goes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X83:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#84:1:A>
I don't think I can ever go back to go back to a nine to five
job anymore

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X85:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#86:1:A>
I cannot imagine myself getting up at six o'clock

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#87:1:A>
Getting to the shower get dressed

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#88:1:A>
Dash off to the bus stop

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#89:1:A>
Squeeze into the bus with everybody <{> <[> else </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X90:1:Z>
<[> How </[> </{> about a twelve to eight job instead </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#91:1:A>
A twelve to eight job is about the the hours that I  ' m working
now

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#92:1:A>
Yeah I I work pretty flexible hours now and <,> it  ' s nice so I get
to play in different things

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#93:1:A>
Lots of time you know I <{> <[> get </[> three different things
going on in one day <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#94:1:A>
So I can play in different places play for different people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X95:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X96:1:Z>
It  ' s nice </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#97:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#98:1:A>
How about you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X99:1:Z>
What do you mean by how about me </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#100:1:A>
Well I thought you will wanting to get more playing jobs
apart from <{> <[> your part-time job </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X101:1:Z>
<[> Of course I do </[> </{> but <unc> a few words </unc>
get jobs you get </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#102:1:A>
Well that was last thing to play

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X103:1:Z>
I don't want to talk about it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#104:1:A>
<{> <[> Was it that bad </[> <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X105:1:Z>
<[> Do you want to </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X106:1:Z>
I don't know I will never go back to play music full-time because
it  ' s just I don't like to rely on the people that that run the music
business and the business involve

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X107:1:Z>
I don't I don't like personally find find it most of the business
had very little to do with what I think is beautiful about music

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X108:1:Z>
So I prefer to to you have to get the job and play <{> <[> <,>
for </[> money but only for fun </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#109:1:A>
<[> Do you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#110:1:A>
But do you have to rely on these people to get your jobs

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X111:1:Z>
Well almost invariably you do

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X112:1:Z>
The only I mean you have a very unique situation because you <,>
are a contractor and you you find what for others as well as yourself so you  ' re
essentially you  ' re the boss

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X113:1:Z>
Uhm but <{> <[> I don't I don't I don't like to like to do that
</[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#114:1:A>
<[> For people with no business skill </[> </{> like you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X115:1:Z>
I really think that but I do not like to do that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#116:1:A>
You have to be ripped off right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X117:1:Z>
I could have been a business person <{> <[> but I just chose not
to </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#118:1:A>
<[> Oh well just face </[> </{> the the fact you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#119:1:A>
You  ' re you  ' re not one of those people with the with the
intelligence and the business skills

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#120:1:A>
Then just face the the truth and be ripped off

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X121:1:Z>
Oh it  ' s true I I I have standards and morality too high to
permit me to be a band leader like you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#122:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X123:1:Z>
You know another point is that you know there there these
trade-offs and and now although I haven't been like playing some of the
weirdest gigs in my life in Hong Kong I I still like to be able to choose and
when I play music for a living I had to take every job that came along
because I never knew when the next one will be even though I work for a while

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X124:1:Z>
It was you never know until it  ' s going to dry up </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#125:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X126:1:Z>
I mean you you you have very been been very lucky in sense of
having long term jobs with with hotels that that that keep you working for
six eight twelve months of a time

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X127:1:Z>
Most musicians don't have that uh that kind of life style which

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X128:1:Z>
I I don't know I think it  ' s it  ' s good for you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#129:1:A>
Well yeah but that  ' s that that comes back to what I  ' ve said
earlier

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#130:1:A>
I still find it pretty insecure

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#131:1:A>
I mean long term what do you mean by long term is what six months
eight months twelve months

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#132:1:A>
That  ' s long term

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X133:1:Z>
For a musician that  ' s <{> <[> very long term </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X134:1:Z>
Sometime like you in a symphony you know which is you know is
boring for a while </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#135:1:A>
<[> Oh well </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#136:1:A>
Yeah maybe I should start thinking about running in other fields

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#137:1:A>
What do you think

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#138:1:A>
I mean apart from my music business <{> <[> as a </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X139:1:Z>
<[> I don't know </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X140:1:Z>
I think you should you  ' re so good at the music business and you
should continue and <{> <[> you </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#141:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> I  ' m not saying I  ' m giving it up

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#142:1:A>
I  ' m I say maybe I should diversify get into some other business
like uhm <&> tut </&> selling Nu Skin products uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X143:1:Z>
No I think instead you should diversify within the music
profession </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#144:1:A>
What

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X145:1:Z>
For example a friend of mine in Los Angeles runs a well sort of a
a complete party business that includes music and other entertainment

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X146:1:Z>
And and you  ' re experiencing you know organising things for the
hotels

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X147:1:Z>
You found magicians clowns and all sorts of silly things

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X148:1:Z>
But what my friend does is he he bills his product as as a sort
of a complete uh entertainment uhm business and he will he will throw a party
for you uhm for a appropriate compensation which includes food catering
entertainment uhm setting up and cleaning up the whole thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X149:1:Z>
He  ' ll do the whole thing is completely integrated

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X150:1:Z>
And he just he  ' s he  ' s very very successful not only that he
always books his own bands for for you know for music for the entertainment
parts of the of of the parties and so you works a lot has a lot of fun and he  ' s
he  ' s he  ' s doing quite well I mean you you can do something like that I I
don't know whether that  ' s right for you but something like that is still
uses your talent and your contacts in music without having to get into a
completely new business </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#151:1:A>
Yeah that might not be appropriate for Hong Kong though

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#152:1:A>
I mean it I know it  ' s an example but it it seems like Hong Kong
people met if when they entertain they would much rather rent a place and at
some nice hotel

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#153:1:A>
All food <{> <[> prepared </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X154:1:Z>
<[> I think </[> </{> the hotel does everything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#155:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X156:1:Z>
But even so the hotels then what do they do

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X157:1:Z>
They they give the the food and beverage manager who who runs
around and organises things like like food and entertainment and then
invariably calls someone like you to organise the music </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#158:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X159:1:Z>
I mean if you if you if you got to be known by the food and
beverage managers and someone who could organise the whole thing then then
they would you  ' ll just have more people working and and of course you  ' d
make more </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#160:1:A>
I in fact to be doing some of the stuff at the moment but not
very regularly yet

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#161:1:A>
It  ' s too hard to get into some hotels because they  ' ve already
got a particular agent <{> <[> <,> </[> or particular department in the hotel
handling that and because they  ' re not willing to change to new new people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X162:1:Z>
<[> Sure </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X163:1:Z>
Well but you  ' ve been quite successful in the last couple of
years gaining new accounts and that sort of thing and you haven't even hardly
tried it all you just sort of wherever you  ' re playing you know you see if
they want somebody to do this stuff

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X164:1:Z>
And they say always say yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X165:1:Z>
Seems like you  ' re quite good at that stuff </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#166:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Well I  ' ll do it and see see what happens </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#167:1:A>
I  ' m I  ' m not too old at the moment <{2> <[2> so I can afford
doing more work </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X168:1:Z>
<[1> Try to do something like something like this </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X169:1:Z>
<[2> I don't know you are pretty old </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#170:1:A>
Uh aw thank you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X171:1:Z>
Uhm definitely you know usually in your upper twenties </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#172:1:A>
Yah I keep doing it for a while and see what happens

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#173:1:A>
May be I don't want to do it after all

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#174:1:A>
I  ' ll give it a try for a matter a couple of years and then may be
I  ' ll decide to go to acting <,> or something

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#175:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#199:1:A>
Uh it was quite funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#200:1:A>
It was a little too long though

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X201:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#202:1:A>
Yeah that  ' s what I thought

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X203:1:Z>
I thought I saw I didn't like it quite well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#204:1:A>
Oh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X205:1:Z>
I thought it was quite <{> <[> funny and </[> sentimentally
appealing without being maudlin maudlin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#206:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#207:1:A>
What

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X208:1:Z>
Maudlin

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X209:1:Z>
M A U D L I N </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#210:1:A>
What does that mean

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X211:1:Z>
Uh now you  ' ve really asked me a difficult question

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X212:1:Z>
<{> <[> <,> Uhm that means it  ' s like that means is kind of like
</[> like too <.> syr </.> syrupy and sappy </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#213:1:A>
<[> Well I see okay I I understand now </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#214:1:A>
Oh so you are telling me that uhm you native English speakers
don't usually know what words mean when you say them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X215:1:Z>
Well uh you know what it means but giving a formal definition is
harder </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#216:1:A>
So what  ' s <mention> sappy </mention>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X217:1:Z>
<mention> Sappy </mention> is is is uhm <{1> <[1> well is </[1>
is is sentimental in a in a very uhm in a very base kind of way

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X218:1:Z>
You know sort of primitive <.> sentimentali </.> not primitive
sentimentality but but really overdone <{2> <[2> sentimentality </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#219:1:A>
<[1> Maudlin </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#220:1:A>
<[2> Okay okay </[2> </{2> you give me you tell part of the <.> mo
</.> part of the movie which particularly gave you that feeling <{> <[> then
I  ' ll relate that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X221:1:Z>
<[> No it </[> </{> didn't give me that feeling that  ' s why I
like it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#222:1:A>
Uh <.> o </.> <{> <[> okay </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X223:1:Z>
<[> It </[> </{> was sentimental but it wasn't maudlin or sappy
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#224:1:A>
All right okay <{> <[> okay </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X225:1:Z>
<[> I </[> </{> like it <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> for that reason

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X226:1:Z>
And it was funny I mean I always like the way Brits <{2> <[2>
speak </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X227:1:Z>
You know that they are very funny I mean that that for instance
the the toast the the toast at the weddings in this movie were hilarious

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X228:1:Z>
No American would ever say anything that funny I mean it is it is
very sort of uhm understated <{3> <[3> wit </[3> that I like

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X229:1:Z>
The Americans are more brash you know just

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X230:1:Z>
They you know they are humour is more kind of in your face <{4>
<[4> <,> but </[4> Brit humour is very <.> s </.> very subtle

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X231:1:Z>
Ours is probably not subtle on the other hand or probably you
know you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X232:1:Z>
Every plumber in London probably says oh that old joke again but
for Americans it  ' s very is very funny </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#233:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#234:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#235:1:A>
<[3> Hah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#236:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#237:1:A>
So what do you say when you propose a toast

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X238:1:Z>
Uh well I actually I <.> ha </.> haven't do that in the <{1> <[1>
weddings and uh one time </[1> I completely forgot I that I had to do that I
was the best man and it didn't occur to me uh I should have a toast prepared

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X239:1:Z>
And so uhm all the sudden I mean it was a big giant reception and
all these people were standing around and and there  ' s going to be a toast
that I  ' m standing there with some friends talking where we were quiet and
trying to be you know uh not not be loud so so people giving the toast
wouldn't be a problem uh for them

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X240:1:Z>
And I  ' m standing there in this crowd and all of a sudden the
groom comes up and says excuse Frank are got a toast to make here

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X241:1:Z>
It was very humiliating and that toast was a complete disaster
<{2> <[2> I mean </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#242:1:A>
<[1> Oh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#243:1:A>


<ICE-HK:S1A-039#244:1:A>
<[2> What did you say </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X245:1:Z>
Well I was first of all I hadn't thought about this at all so I
didn't make it well the toast in like ten seconds

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X246:1:Z>
So of course as you know said how much we all care for the bride
and groom and how happy we are for them and you know we should drink to their
health and all this <{1> <[1> stupid things </[1> that you always say <{2>
<[2> but I mean </[2> if I had time to think about I would have talked about
how you know first met Paul who was the sex offenders uh rehabilitation
programme he  ' s come a long way since then and that you know now he  ' s got
his drinking problem you know under controlI I am sure he will make a good
you know uhm uh uh good husband if not parent

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X247:1:Z>
We still worry about that

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X248:1:Z>
And their marriage will <?> set on like </?> that would people
would enjoy that laugh

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X249:1:Z>
You know that it was a complete disaster

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X250:1:Z>
And the only thing that everyone was talking about that was how
the the best man forgot to deliver a toast </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#251:1:A>
<[1> Oh what  ' s </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#252:1:A>
<[2> Yah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#253:1:A>
That  ' s quite funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#254:1:A>
Its  '  uhm I think most for the time these things are only funny
for the people who who know the the couple

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#255:1:A>
You know for people like me say I go I go play in a wedding uh it  ' s
one of the most boring jobs

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X256:1:Z>
Then how about how about Chinese weddings

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X257:1:Z>
Do you have like do you have like a a a best man give a toast or
anything like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#258:1:A>
Uh let  ' s see

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#259:1:A>
They have the invited guests to go up to the stage with the newly
weds and talk about what great people they are and how lovely the are and
everything

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X260:1:Z>
Rarely make fun of them and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#261:1:A>
Yes well yes some oh yeah when you go to those Chinese
banquet in the evening <,,> sometimes they have all these wild games

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#262:1:A>
It <.> de </.> it depends on the crowd but I think most of the
younger younger people now they would go into this stupid <,> game of uhm
teasing the the bride and bridegroom

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#263:1:A>
Like you know asking the girl to wear some kind of a grape in
front of her of her of her chest and ask the <,> bridegroom to go pick up the
grape in front of her chest and something like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X264:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#265:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#266:1:A>
And there  ' s even there more other games that  ' s really funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#267:1:A>
They <.> al </.> always pick up pieces from the chicken dish dish
<,> from the night

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#268:1:A>
<{> <[> <,> They </[> will pick the head

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X269:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X270:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#271:1:A>
One of the wings

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#272:1:A>
Uhm a piece of chicken breast

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#273:1:A>
A drum stick and the <,> tail <,,> the butt of the of the chicken

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X274:1:Z>
I think tail was </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#275:1:A>
And then they will put everything in the on the plate and
blindfold the bride <,> no blindfold the bridegroom <,> to ask him to pick
one piece from the dish

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#276:1:A>
Whatever piece he ends up picking he has to kiss that part of the
bride <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#277:1:A>
So let  ' s say if he <.> ch </.> if he pick <{> <[> up </[> the
chicken head then he will have to kiss the bride  ' s head somewhere

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X278:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X279:1:Z>
On the beak </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#280:1:A>
Uh yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#281:1:A>
And if it  ' s the tail then who knows where

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X282:1:Z>
I guess everybody know that  ' s her tongue

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X283:1:Z>
Well so that  ' s uhm that  ' s sound interesting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#284:1:A>
Well that  ' s interesting for the people but uhm when you go
play <{> <[> in a in a function like that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X285:1:Z>
<[> Oh yeah it should be boring </[> </{> for you just sit <{>
<[> there and watch </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#286:1:A>
<[> You have to sit there </[> </{> <{> <[> and watch all
this </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X287:1:Z>
<[> See that for a hundred times </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#288:1:A>
Yeah and when you are sitting on stage trying to look very
pleasant and very very very please and everything when they talk about how
they met each other in uh you know like five years ago and how they how they
uh you know start to like each other a lot more and the last five <{> <[>
years oh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X289:1:Z>
<[> Oh they go through all of that </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#290:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X291:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#292:1:A>
Sometime they even show you pictures of the of the couple
when they are kids

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X293:1:Z>
Yeah I guess is see this is this is what I consider kind kind it
is really over the top

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X294:1:Z>
I mean I  ' ve been to weddings in the States that have been like
this I went to this one wedding I I was not the best man or usher of this
wedding day

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X295:1:Z>
And hah they had this horrible thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X296:1:Z>
They had in the middle of the ceremony they had a a tenor and a
soprano singing this duet from the West Side Story musical

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X297:1:Z>
It was the one uhm where they uhm make up our hand one <{> <[>
hand that sort of thing </[> <unc> Two-words </unc> our hands one
hand

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X298:1:Z>
Yeah a one hand is already one hand but anyway it was it was
really uh uh I almost had to throw up

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X299:1:Z>
It was quite awful </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#300:1:A>
<[> Uh yeah yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#301:1:A>
Because they sing so badly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X302:1:Z>
No they sing wonderfully but were so sappy and uh maudlin and
wasn't it

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X303:1:Z>
You know I mean they are getting married already it was going to
incline the cry be sentimental as are already doing it

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X304:1:Z>
And then they sing this really moving love song from this sort of
you know remake of Romeo and Juliet

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X305:1:Z>
And so anybody who is at all inclined to blubbering and <unc>
one-word </unc> and <unc> a few words </unc> is awful

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X306:1:Z>
It  ' s to me that it  ' s over the top

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X307:1:Z>
I mean it  ' s kind of like if you watch a a bad television show
you get the the same sort of you know they push all the right buttons

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X308:1:Z>
Lots of this work </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#309:1:A>
Yeah most people make it too much like a sometime of a show
now

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#310:1:A>
You know <.> hav </.> having wedding parties and stuff

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X311:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#312:1:A>
It  ' s like they have they have they are obliged to entertain
everybody <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#313:1:A>
But it  ' s okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#314:1:A>
If I get the job I  ' ll still do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#315:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X316:1:Z>
Western have you ever driven a car </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#317:1:A>
As a matter of fact yes I I have

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#318:1:A>
I I drove illegally

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X319:1:Z>
When </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#320:1:A>
When I I was in holiday in Vancouver <{> <[> a </[> friend of
mine brought me over to one of these empty parking lots <{> <[> <,> </[> and
I had some illegal driving lessons

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#321:1:A>
It was good fun

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#322:1:A>
I I loved it

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#323:1:A>
It was very easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#324:1:A>
I had a an automatic

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X325:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X326:1:Z>
<[> Oh yeah </[> </{> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#327:1:Z>
Oh it  ' s automatic </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#328:1:A>
Yeah so it was just like you know put

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X329:1:Z>
Just steer it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#330:1:A>
Turn it on and just steer

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#331:1:A>
Yeah but <.> an </.> another time I was given a standard or how to
call it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X332:1:Z>
That  ' s manual <{> <[> sort </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#333:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> and it was very hard

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#334:1:A>
I just couldn't I couldn't keep my hands and my feet to
co-ordinate

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#335:1:A>
And I was so I was so nervous you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#336:1:A>
My friend kept telling me <.> lif </.> lift your foot up half-way
and then and the uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#337:1:A>
How do you call it I don't remember

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#338:1:A>
You know the clutch <{> <[> should not stop </[> you know you have
to you have to move your hand and lift your foot at the same time but not all
of your foot only half-way up

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X339:1:Z>
<[> Oh yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X340:1:Z>
All right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#341:1:A>
And then I just I got so uh so tense that I could hardly do
it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X342:1:Z>

not a kid </X>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X360:1:Z>
No place to park <unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#361:1:A>
Yeah there are proper places for you to park if you pay three
thousand dollars a a month <{> <[> <,> to </[> rent a little place for your
car

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X362:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X363:1:Z>
Yeah I heard in the paper last year that there was a parking
space for sale in the middle in the Mid-levels

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X364:1:Z>
It went with the flat and not all the flats have parking spaces

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X365:1:Z>
If you want one with with a flat they will cost you something
like a million dollars Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X366:1:Z>
And uh for the <{> <[> for the parking space paid </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X367:1:Z>
And cos it was saying in the South China Morning Post they were
saying the the the cost of a of a parking space in Mid-levels will buy you a
really nice house in Australia </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-039#368:1:A>
<[> Just for the park lot </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#369:1:A>

interviewing this <,> uh Japanese violinist <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#371:1:A>
She now she has got a house in Australia and she said the house
that the rent that she  ' s paying no how did it go

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#372:1:A>
The money that she spent on the house in Australia can only afford
one third of her flat <{> <[> <,> in </[> Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#X373:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#382:1:A>

haven't practiced

<ICE-HK:S1A-039#398:1:A>

know it  ' s not like teaching uhm say English you know that some kind of a
rule that you can you can go by
