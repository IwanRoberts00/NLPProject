<bold> N </bold> ot too long ago , when the Hong Kong public heard
about the " Chinese white dolphin" , they only had the idea that it was the
mascot for the Hong Kong Handover in 1997 , and at that time some even
thought that it was merely a cartoon character .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#4:1>
The others may believe that Chinese white dolphins are endemic to Hong
Kong and soon to be extinct , thanks to the incorrect information released by
some local media and environmental groups .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#5:1>
Luckily , the tide has turned .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#6:1>
In the last few years , through the education and publicity programme
organized by the Hong Kong government and extensive coverage by local
newspapers and media , the Chinese white dolphin has now become the most
celebrated creature in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#7:1>
Many members of the public are quite familiar with the knowledge of
the dolphins , and some have even participated in the local dolphin-watching
tours organized by private operators or NGOs to appreciate the beauty of
Chinese white dolphins and their unique pink colour !

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#8:1>
To celebrate the second anniversary of <it> Hong Kong Discovery </it>
, a special feature of Chinese white dolphins is prepared for our readers to
learn more about these unique animals in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#9:1>
It is our hope that this article can arouse interest of those who care
about nature and conserving the marine environment . </p> <O> Four photos
</O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#10:1>
<bold> <it> Name </it> </bold> - The name &ldquo; Chinese white
dolphin &rdquo; is given by the local people in southern China , and actually
its official common name is &ldquo; Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin &rdquo; and
its scientific name is &ldquo; <it> Sousa chinensis </it> . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#11:1>
Local fishermen used to call them &ldquo; Mazhu fish &rdquo; &obrack; 
meaning the fish of the sea goddess &cbrack; , while others may call them &ldquo;
black taboo &rdquo; and &ldquo; white taboo . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#12:1>
<bold> <it> Distribution </it> </bold> - Chinese white dolphins
are mainly distributed in the western waters of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#13:1>
Their major habitats include the waters north and west of Lantau
Island .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#14:1>
In the summer and autumn , they also occur in waters south of Lantau
Island .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#15:1>
In addition , the dolphin population is also distributed throughout
the Pearl River Estuary to the west of the Hong Kong border , from
Neilingding Island in the north to Guishan Island in the south , and
extending westward to waters near Zuhai and Macau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#16:1>
There are even sighting records of Chinese white dolphin occurring in
Modao Men and further west . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#17:1>
<bold> <it> Abundance </it> </bold> - In Hong Kong waters , the
abundance of Chinese white dolphins fluctuates among different seasons ,
ranging from 45 dolphins in spring to 152 dolphins in summer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#18:1>
From the past seven years of study , number of dolphins have not
decreased or increased substantially .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#19:1>
The current abundance estimate of the Pearl River Estuary population
is about 1,400 animals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#20:1>
<bold> <it> Social Structure </it> </bold> - Chinese white
dolphins usually hang out in groups of 3-5 individuals , and the group size
ranges from a single individual to large group of 23 animals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#21:1>
Their social structure is quite fluid , which means their association
with one another is very momentary , and they change their companions
frequently . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#22:1>
<bold> <it> Body length and weight </it> </bold> - Newborn calves
of Chinese white dolphins are only 1 metre in length with a weight of 10-20
kg , whereas fully grown adults can reach up to 2.8 metres and weigh more
than 200 kg . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#23:1>
<bold> <it> Body colour </it> </bold> - Among the many species of
whales and dolphins , the Chinese white dolphins along the southern coast of
China have the most unique and varied body colouration .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#24:1>
The newborns are dark gray in colour , and as they reach the juvenile
stage , their body colour starts to change form light gray to grayish pink
with spotting all over the body .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#25:1>
When they get older and older , their gray spots gradually disappear
, and the adult Chinese white dolphins are pinkish white in colour , with
little or no spotting at all ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#26:1>
<bold> <it> Life span </it> </bold> - The oldest Chinese white
dolphin we aged so far in Hong Kong is 33 years old , but it is believed that
this species can live up to 40 years old . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#27:1>
<bold> <it> Life history </it> </bold> - Summer and autumn are
the breeding seasons for the Chinese white dolphins , with summer as their
calving peak .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#28:1>
Their gestation period can last up to 11 months , and mothers mostly
give birth to one calf .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#29:1>
The dolphin mother needs to nurse its baby for at least a year . </p>
<O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#30:1>
<bold> <it> Diet </it> </bold> - Chinese white dolphins prefer to
live in the estuary , and their diet is also composed mainly of estuarine
fishes , including lionhead , croakers , herring and anchovies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#31:1>
<bold> <it> Threats </it> </bold> - In Hong Kong , the dolphins
have to face numerous threats , including fishery bycatch , vessel collision
, water pollution , underwater noise and habitat loss , which may affect
their long-term survival . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#32:1>
<bold> <it> Legal protection </it> </bold> - There are several
laws in place to protect the Chinese white dolphins and other cetacean
species , including the &ldquo; Wild Animal Protection Ordinance &rdquo; and
the &ldquo; Animal and Plants &obrack;  Protected Species &cbrack; Ordinance . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#33:1>
The dolphins are also benefited by the implementation of the &ldquo;
Marine Park Ordinance &rdquo; and " Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance .

</bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#35:1>
Chinese white dolphins are also known as Indo-Pacific humpback
dolphins .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#36:1>
Their name has already implied that they do not only occur in Chinese
waters , but also along the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean and western
Pacific Ocean .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#37:1>
They prefer to live in estuarine environments with water depth less
than 20 metres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#38:1>
Actually how are the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins outside Hong
Kong ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#39:1>
Let me take you to a few places where they commonly occur and explain
some of their interesting features . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese
translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#40:1>
<bold> Taiwan </bold> - Three were some unconfirmed reports of
the occurrence of Chinese white dolphins in Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#41:1>
With only a few standing records of this species in the past ,
researchers recorded their first sightings of Chinese white dolphins near Tai
Chung Harbour during the summer of 2002 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#42:1>
During the five-day research cruise , researchers had frequent
sightings of dolphin groups to confirm that there are quite a few animals in
the population along the western coast of Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#43:1>
However , the status of the population needs to be determined by
further research . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O> <O> A
map </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#44:1>
<bold> Xiamen , Fujian Province of PRC </bold> - Apart from the
humpback dolphins in the Pearl River Estuary , those in Xiamen are another
population that is well-known to Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#45:1>
Unfortunately the number of dolphins in Xiamen has decreased
dramatically in the last several decades .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#46:1>
Due to various threats caused by human activities , scientists
generally believe that there are no more than 100 animals surviving in the
Xiamen Harbour . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#47:1>
<bold> Beihai , Guangdong Province of PRC </bold> - Only recently
, the humpback dolphins in this area have started to receive some attention
from scientists .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#48:1>
They are mostly distributed along two mudflats near the estuary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#49:1>
A preliminary study on their abundance and ecology is currently
underway . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#50:1>
<bold> South Africa </bold> - The physical appearance of the
South African humpback dolphins is clearly different from those in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#51:1>
They have a hump on their back just below the dorsal fin , which is
how they got the name &ldquo; humpback &rdquo; dolphin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#52:1>
Their colour throughout different life stages is dark gray in colour
without too much variation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#53:1>
The humpback dolphins in South Africa are mostly distributed along
the coastal waters of South Africa , usually occurring in waters within 1 km
of the coast . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#54:1>
<bold> Thailand </bold> - The picture shown here was taken from a
group of humpback dolphins living in a captive environment in the Underwater
World of Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#55:1>
They are originally captured from the Gulf of Thailand .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#56:1>
Information on humpback dolphins in Thailand is scarce , and their
body colour pattern is also quite different from those in South Africa or
southern coast of China . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#57:1>
<bold> Australia </bold> - The body colour of Australian humpback
dolphins is similar to their counterparts in South Africa , and they are dark
gray in colour from newborn to adult stages .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#58:1>
They are mainly distributed in the coastal waters along the northern
and northeastern coast of Australia . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese

<bold> Looking for different individuals - Photo identification
</bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#60:1>
To better understand the life of dolphins , researchers need to
identify every single individual using photo-identification techniques .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#61:1>
To identify individual dolphins with unique characteristics ,
researchers usually use a long-lens autofocus camera to take up close shots
of the dolphins ' body features , such as the nicks and shapes of the dorsal
fin , or wound marks left on the body .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#62:1>
Then the photographs will be matched with the photo-ID catalogue to
see whether the individual dolphin was sighted before or it is a new record
for the catalog .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#63:1>
So far researchers have already identified over 260 individual
dolphins in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary , and this information
helps us to understand their home range , movement patterns and life history .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#64:1>
Here I would like to introduce a few familiar friends that we
encounter frequently in our waters... </p> <O> A map </O> <O> Chinese

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#65:1>
<bold> Square Fin </bold> &obrack;  NL24 &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#66:1>
The distinct feature of this mature adult is its square-shaped
dorsal fin , which can be easily recognized in the field .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#67:1>
Square Fin is the most commonly seen dolphin in Hong Kong , with over
60 resightings in the past seven years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#68:1>
Its home range comprises the waters near the Brothers and Lung Kwu
Chau , but it also occasionally occurs in waters near Tai O . </p> <O> A map

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#69:1>
<bold> Ringo </bold> &obrack;  NL11 &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#70:1>
The circular wound around Ringo  ' s head makes  ' her ' the most
noticeable individual by the researchers and dolphin-watchers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#71:1>
Her wound was probably created by a fishing net when she was once
entangled in it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#72:1>
Ringo mostly occurs around the waters of Lung Kwu Chau .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#73:1>
Since Ringo was seen swimming with a calf a few years ago , we can
then determine that Ringo is a female dolphin . </p> <O> A map </O> <O>

<bold> Curly </bold> &obrack;  NL111 &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#75:1>
Curly is a spotted juvenile with the trailing edge of its dorsal
fin curled backward . This is believed to be caused by a cut .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#76:1>
Since the first sighting of Curly in 1998 , Curly has become one of
the most commonly encountered individuals , mostly occurring in waters around
the Brothers . </p> <O> A map </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<bold> Scar </bold> &obrack;  E107 &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#78:1>
This heavily spotted juvenile is believed to be a male dolphin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#79:1>
The range of Scar  ' s sightings is quite extensive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#80:1>
Before 1997 , Scar usually occurred in waters east of Lantau Island ,
but since then it has mostly occurred near the Brothers . </p> <O> Several

<bold> Other cetacean species discovered in Hong Kong </bold> </h>
<O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#82:1>
Every year , there are some cetaceans found stranded on Hong Kong
beaches , and most of them are Chinese white dolphins and finless porpoises ,
which are residents of Hong Kong waters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#83:1>
However , once in a while researchers also discovered some other rare
species , which are probably washed ashore from offshore waters , or getting
lost to Hong Kong and stranded on beach .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#84:1>
According to the official records , there were a total of 14
cetaceans species recorded in Hong Kong , and let  ' s take a look at some of
the stranding cases... </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O>

</bold> </p> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#86:1>
There are quite a few standing records of the bottlenose dolphins
in Hong Kong , probably due to their preference for coastal habitat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#87:1>
Among these , there were two stranding incidents with live-stranded
animal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#88:1>
For example , the one shown in this picture was stranded on a mudflat
at Sheung Pak Nai inside Deep By in March 1986 . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#90:1>
Two large groups of long-beaked common dolphins have been sighted
in Victoria Harbour and Sai Kung respectively in the past , and there were
also a few stranding cases of this species in Hong Kong . The fresh carcass
of common dolphin was found stranded in Shap Long on Lantau Island in 1989 .

Currently Fraser  ' s dolphin is still a poorly known species to
scientist .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#109:1>
They mainly occur in tropical waters , including those in
Philippines and Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#110:1>

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#115:1>
<bold> What can we do when we encounter a stranded dolphin ? </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#116:1>
Every year there are a number of dolphins found washed ashore in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#117:1>
Since 1975 , AFCD has established a cetacean stranding investigation
programme , allowing researchers to collect some basic information and
samples from the stranded cetaceans for various studies and determining the
cause of death .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#118:1>
Sample collected such as teeth can be used for age determination;
blubber , liver and kidney can be used in ecotoxicological analysis; and
stomach content can be used for studying their feeding habits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#119:1>
When we encounter a stranded cetacean carcass , what should we
do to help the researchers ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#120:1>
In fact we should inform AFCD staff immediately at their 24 hour
stranding hotline &obrack;  2377-1661 or 7116-3898
#3029 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#121:1>
The informant should provide details such as the date , time and
location of the discovery , and the size , colour , special features and
decomposition state of the stranded animal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#122:1>
All this information can aid the researcher to decide what kind of
action is needed to attend the standing event . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#123:1>
If you happen to find a cetacean stranded alive on beach , you
should contact AFCD immediately and provide any details .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#124:1>
With the instruction from cetacean experts and AFCD staff , there
are several things you can do to relieve the pain of the stranded cetacean
before the investigation team arrives .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#125:1>
You can cover the animal with wet clothes &obrack;  but do not cover its
blowhole , eyes and fins &cbrack; to avoid sunburn or heat loss in cold weather .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#126:1>
You can also dig holes underneath its pectoral fins to release the
tremendous pressure exerted on the abdomen of the animal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#127:1>
Unrelated people should not surround the stranded animal as a crowd
may exert much stress to the animal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#128:1>
No one should pull or drag the fins of the animal &obrack;  including its
pectoral fins , dorsal fins and fluke &cbrack; as these are their most delicate body
parts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#129:1>
Finally , no one should attempt to push the animal back to water or
try to rescue the animal , which might cause greater harm to the cetacean .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#130:1>
We should wait for experienced cetacean researchers and
veterinarians to decide what is the best way to handle the animal .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#131:1>
We should bear in mind that all decisions and actions should be made
with the animal welfare as the first priority , and we should not impose our
own personal feelings and desires on the suffering animal . </p> <O> Chinese

<bold> Finless porpoises - neighbours of Chinese white dolphins
</bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#133:1>
Those who have read volume 7 and 8 of <it> Hong Kong Discovery
</it> should be quite familiar with finless porpoises , another resident
cetacean in Hong Kong waters .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#134:1>
Although both finless porpoises and Chinese white dolphins reside in
Hong Kong waters , they are very different in terms of appearance ,
distribution and ecology .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#135:1>
Let  ' s have a review on the information about these engaging animals !
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#136:1>
<bold> <it> Appearance </it> </bold> - Finless porpoises do not
have a long rostrum or dorsal fin on their back , and their body colour has
no variation throughout their life , which is mainly dark gray in colour .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#137:1>
<bold> <it> Distribution </it> </bold> - They usually occur in
eastern and southern waters of Hong Kong , with obvious seasonal variations
in distribution . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#138:1>
<bold> <it> Abundance </it> </bold> - The number of finless
porpoises in Hong Kong peaks in spring with about 152 animals , while the
autumn has the lowest number of porpoises with only 55 animals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#139:1>
<bold> <it> Behaviour </it> </bold> - They are very shy and
elusive animals , with rapid movement on the water surface to take a brief
breath .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#140:1>
They seldom perform any aerial behaviour . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#141:1>
<bold> <it> Body length </it> </bold> - Newborn calves are about
70cm in length , while adults can grow up to 1.8m . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#142:1>
<bold> <it> Prey preference </it> </bold> - In addition to
coastal fish species , finless porpoises also prey on squid and shrimp as
their main prey items . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#143:1>
<bold> <it> Life span </it> </bold> - Porpoises seldom live up
to about 20 years of age , but a few individuals in Hong Kong were determined
to be over 30 years old ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#144:1>
<bold> <it> Global distribution </it> </bold> - They are
distributed from the Persian Gulf in the west and southern Japan in the north
to Indonesian waters in the south .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#145:1>
They are also widely distributed in the coastal waters of China ,
including Yellow Sea , Bohai , East and South China Seas .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#146:1>
There is even a freshwater population of finless porpoises residing
in the Yangtze river . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<bold> Where to watch Chinese white dolphins... </bold> </h> <O>
Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#149:1>
The best places to observe Chinese white dolphins are mainly in
the western waters of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#150:1>
These include the waters around Lung Kwu Chau , Sha Chau , the
Brothers , Black Point , the northeastern corner of airport platform , and
Castle Peak Power Station on the northern side of Lantau Island .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#151:1>
In addition , dolphin watchers can find dolphins fairly easily along
the west coast of Lantau including waters near Tai O and Peaked Hill .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#152:1>
Dolphin watchers can depart from piers at Tung Chung or Tuen Mun
which are near to Hong Kong western waters to minimize idling time spent on
the boat . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#153:1>
<bold> What to bring... </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#154:1>
? Wear comfortable , light clothing and shoes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#155:1>
Under cold and windy weather , be sure to wear a windbreaker or a
coat , and bring a raincoat when it rains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#156:1>
? Those who may get seasick should take some sea-sickness pills
30 minutes before boarding the dolphin watching boat . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#157:1>
? To avoid getting a sunburn , remember to wear a hat and apply
some sunblock . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#158:1>
? Sunlight reflected from water surfaces can hurt your eyes , so
wearing a pair of sunglasses is recommended . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#159:1>
? Make sure to reduce as much waste as possible , and bring all
the trash back on land to dispose of it . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#160:1>
<bold> Other tips... </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#161:1>
? In order to enrich your dolphin watching experience , you
should choose a dolphin operator with good practices and ample experience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#162:1>
The operator should also be able to provide the most accurate and
updated information on the Chinese white dolphins . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#163:1>
? Be familiar with the code of conduct for dolphin watching
activities adopted by the AFCD , and make sure the boat driver can follow
these guidelines without harassing the dolphins . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#164:1>
? During the trip , be sure to hold onto the handrail , as the
boat may rock back and forth when vessels or high speed ferries pass by
frequently in dolphin habitat . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#165:1>
? After locating a dolphin group , the crowd should avoid
congregating on one side of the boat or it could tilt at an angle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#166:1>
Remember that the dolphins will swim all around the boat instead of
staying on one side of the boat .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#167:1>
So participants should be patient to stay where they are and the
dolphins will finally swim to your side . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#168:1>
? The chance of seeing dolphins really depends on weather and
sea conditions on that day , and the chance could be lower in heavy rain ,
low visibility or rough sea conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#169:1>
Also , participants should understand that Chinese white dolphins
are wild animals , and they are not living to entertain and please us , but
they are engaged in their own daily activities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#170:1>
Therefore , be easy minded , and patiently wait and observe , and
you may be lucky enough to see some dolphins close by ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#171:1>
? The most important thing is to realize that dolphin watchers
are visiting the home of dolphins , where everyone should behave as a
considerate visitor .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#172:1>
Let the dolphins to decide whether they approach or flee from our
boats , instead of keep chasing them . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#174:1>
To observe dolphins in the wild is definitely a memorable
experience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#175:1>
However , while we are watching the dolphins , are we concerned
about how they feel ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#176:1>
Similar to humans , the dolphins need space to feed , play and rest .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#177:1>
Our visit to their home has already caused some disturbance to their
daily life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#178:1>
If we attempt to get closer and chase them desperately , the
disturbance will become large enough to cause stress and negative impacts on
their health .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#179:1>
In order to minimize the disturbance to the dolphins during dolphin
watching activities , AFCD has set a code of conduct for these activities ,
hoping all dolphin watching tour operators and dolphin waters can obey these
rules . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#180:1>
<bold> Code of conduct for dolphin watching activities </bold> </h>
<O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#181:1>
1.

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#182:1>
Basic principle: always observe from a distance , do not seek to
contact , touch , feed or harm dolphins in the wild . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#183:1>
2.

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#184:1>
When dolphins are sighted , maintain forward progress at a slow and
steady speed or stop with no sudden course change .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#185:1>
Never conduct reverse throttling in the vicinity of dolphins . Boat
speed should not exceed 10 knots .

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#186:1>
When observing dolphins , always parallel the dolphin  ' s course at
slow speed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#187:1>
3.

<ICE-HK:W2B-027#188:1>
Never approach dolphins head on; approach at an angle . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#189:1>
4. Only one dolphin watching vessel should be within 500 metres
of a group of dolphins at any one time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-027#190:1>
5. Never chase or cut across the course of dolphins , separate
mothers and calves , split up groups of  ' corner ' dolphins between boats ,
nets , or shore . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>
