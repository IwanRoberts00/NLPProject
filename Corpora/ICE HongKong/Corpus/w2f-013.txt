BE SLIM </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-013#3:1>
No sweets , no ice-cream , no chocolate , please !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#4:1>
Never take any of these , not even a very little bit .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#5:1>
Add only sugar substitutes when you drink coffee or lemon tea .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#6:1>
In case you have no such wonderful thing at hand , always remember ,
one tablespoon of sugar is better than two , half is better than one and of
course , it is perfect to have none .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#7:1>
It is a good habit to check your weight at least once a day , three
times a day is much better , five times a day even better , so that you will
immediately know in case you have the slightest increase in weight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#8:1>
It is a must that you stop eating completely for at least ten hours
should that terrible nightmare happen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#9:1>
Look in the mirror whenever you come across one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#10:1>
Examine yourself carefully and honestly in the mirror and see whether
any part of your body has exceeded its standard size .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#11:1>
Stop eating for at least twelve hours should that horrible thing
happen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#12:1>
Even though this will do nothing to help recover the standard size of
your body , it serves as a good punishment for your overeating .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#13:1>
Always drink two glasses of water every two hours so that your
stomach will remain full throughout the day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#14:1>
This effectively prevents unnecessary eating between meals .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#15:1>
Remember , never eat your meals before swallowing down three glasses
of water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#16:1>
It is extremely dangerous to have your meals when your stomach is
empty .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#17:1>
Always have your dinner when your favourite TV programme is shown .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#18:1>
It is an efficient method to slow down your eating and make you aware
of your fullness when you are <it> nearly </it> full , but not after you are
too full .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#19:1>
Avoid having your meal outside , especially with a large group of
friends .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#20:1>
It is a great temptation for you to overeat under such conditions
because usually the cost of the meal is equally shared .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#21:1>
Last but not least , never have meals with underweight people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#22:1>
Such people tend to eat much more than they need without putting on
extra weight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#23:1>
So it is exceedingly easy for you to eat more than you need to
survive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#24:1>
It is safer for you to stay away from such people during lunch hour
or dinner time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#25:1>
Always remember that !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#26:1>
Remember .... </p> </I>

THE TRIUMPHANT SMILE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-013#28:2>
I reached home at half past four .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#29:2>
My elder sister  ' s black leather shoes were lying on the door-mat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#30:2>
Beside them were Mum  ' s and Dad  ' s slippers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#31:2>
&ldquo; Mum , you  ' ve come back at the right time !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#32:2>
The conditioner here has been used up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#33:2>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#34:2>
Please bring me a new bottle , coz I  ' ve just wetted my hair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#35:2>
Thanks ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#36:2>
My sister  ' s voice came out from the bathroom .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#37:2>
Mum usually came back at this hour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#38:2>
I did not correct my sister .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#39:2>
If she thought that I were Mum , she would thank me in a more polite
manner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#40:2>
I opened the lowest drawer of the cupboard to fetch the conditioner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#41:2>
Then I shuffled to the door of the bathroom and knocked on it twice
with the bottle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#42:2>
&ldquo; Come in ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#43:2>
I opened the door and entered .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#44:2>
To my astonishment , in front of me was a girl without clothes or
underwear but only with attractive curves .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#45:2>
My elder sister was completely naked !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#46:2>
This was the first time I had seen a naked female body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#47:2>
I only saw one side of it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#48:2>
Shining soap bubbles were sliding down her snowy skin .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#49:2>
It was so beautiful that I could not remove my eyes from her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#50:2>
At first , my elder sister was scared at the sight of me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#51:2>
But right after she noticed that my goggling eyes were rolling up and
down her body in curiosity and silent admiration , her open mouth immediately
gave way to a triumphant smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#52:2>
&ldquo; Don't look at me like that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#53:2>
Get out ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#54:2>
But she did not draw the shower curtain or cover her body with her
towel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#55:2>
Her words were like an indirect invitation for me to continue gazing
at her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#56:2>
My feet were glued to the floor even though a voice deep in my heart
kept urging me to stop watching and get out quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#57:2>
At last it was the music of the door-bell that forced me to walk away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#58:2>
I put down the bottle of conditioner , which I had been holding
tightly in my right hand , closed the door behind me silently and dashed to
open the main door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#59:2>
It was Mum .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#60:2>
I explained to her in broken sentences why I was home so early today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#61:2>
Then I went to my desk and opened a text-book .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#62:2>
My head was so full of thoughts that I could hardly finish reading
even a short paragraph .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#63:2>
I used to believe that it was an offence for a male to look at a
female  ' s naked body , except when they were husband and wife or lovers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#64:2>
Yet my sister  ' s triumphant smile showed that far from being an
offence , it was in fact a compliment for the female .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#65:2>
Soon after , Mum announced that dinner was ready .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#66:2>
Luckily , my elder sister usually sits next to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#67:2>
It was convenient to avoid eye contact .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#68:2>
I gobbled my food to avoid conversation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#69:2>
Fortunately , I usually talk very little at dinner , otherwise , my
behaviour might have appeared strange .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#70:2>
&ldquo; I  ' ll do the dishes tonight, &rdquo; I volunteered .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#71:2>
I thought that by keeping my hands busy , my mind might stop thinking
about the scene .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#72:2>
But the attractive curves of the bowl and the wonderful shining
bubbles only kept reminding me of what I had seen this afternoon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#73:2>
While I can use detergent to wash away the grease from the dishes ,
what should I use to wash away my sister  ' s triumphant smile from my memory ?
</p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#74:3>
<bold> A HOMELESS IN THE PEARL OF THE ORIENT </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#75:3>
Winnie Chow </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-013#76:3>
The air was thick and moist , stinking with the fragrance of
cheap antiseptic liquid soap .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#77:3>
He hated being there because he couldn't stand the smell .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#78:3>
But there was no choice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#79:3>
His body was cocooned in his own staleness , and a wave of nausea
swept over him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#80:3>
He carefully pressed out a bottle cap of stinky liquid hand soap and
stumbled to the shower cubicle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#81:3>
He took off his old worn-out clothes and finished showering in four
minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#82:3>
While he was washing his only pair of underwear , he studied his face
in the brown-splattered mirror .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#83:3>
Strands of greasy dark long hair fell over his lifeless , clouded
eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#84:3>
His forehead was balding , which made him look older .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#85:3>
He tidied up his oily hair with some tap water , and patted his face
with wet hands .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#86:3>
The wrinkles on his forehead and cheeks had deepened , and his skin
was no longer supple and bright .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#87:3>
&ldquo; Is this really me? &rdquo; he murmured , like a desolate
philosopher asking silly questions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#88:3>
He wondered how many faces this filthy , steam-blurred mirror had
reflected .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#89:3>
People from all walks of life whom he had never met , and would never
meet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#90:3>
This public bathroom was just another place for the collection of
individuals  '  history at the root of society .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#91:3>
Sometimes he was not sure what had led him astray , but sometimes ,
he suspected he was merely a pervert .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#92:3>
When he walked out of the bathroom in Sham Shui Po , it was nearly
six in the evening .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#93:3>
Neon lights flashed restlessly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#94:3>
The arrow signs in red , green and blue lit the street up , showing
men making their way quickly to their comfort .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#95:3>
Women at the age of thirty something in heavy make up , exhaling
clouds of light , white smoke , standing by the staircase of old buildings ,
waiting for someone they had never met .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#96:3>
He set off on foot to Tsim Sha Tsui .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#97:3>
He usually watched other pedestrians and studied their faces .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#98:3>
He could have been a sociologist if he had wanted to be one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#99:3>
He knew if a person was happy or sad , blissful or unfortunate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#100:3>
He was once a man in suit and tie , walking proudly along broad
Nathan Road .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#101:3>
He had once dined in elegant restaurants and shopped in famous
boutiques , but the past did not seem worth mentioning anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#102:3>
In some hidden corner of the Cultural Centre , some comatose bodies
lay scattered .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#103:3>
The sick , yellow beam flooded from the big sports lights .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#104:3>
Across Victoria Harbour , the blue , red , yellow and green neon
lights of Central and Wan Chai shimmered , dyeing the thick clouds above in
different colors .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#105:3>
A glamorous view of city , isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#106:3>
But some trembling bodies lay hidden , contorted with sleep ,
alcohol , cigarettes and drugs , hidden where no heavenly light reached .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#107:3>
There lay dried faces with sunken eyes , skeletal hands , yellow
teeth with stale breath .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#108:3>
He murmured , sitting alone on the railings beyond the waterfront .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#109:3>
Fashionable street-kids began to gather at the public square in
front of the Cultural Centre .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#110:3>
They played with skateboards and rollerblades and moved every joint
in fashionable break-dance .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#111:3>
It was time for him to go to the 24-hour McDonald  ' s just next to
HMV to collect some food for himself and his dogs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#112:3>
It was eleven o'clock .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#113:3>
He picked up some leftovers &dash; french fries , half-eaten Big
Macs and several pieces of McNuggets .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#114:3>
Boss and MuiMui love McNuggets , he thought .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#115:3>
His life of dining in elegant restaurants , talking about aesthetics
, had gone with the wind and dust .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#116:3>
Though he said he loved the Cultural Centre and his stress-free life
, he couldn't deny that he had to give up his dignity whenever he was hungry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#117:3>
&ldquo; This is environmentally friendly ... to save food from being
discarded, &rdquo; he said to himself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#118:3>
It was nearly midnight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#119:3>
He returned to his place near the backstage entrance of the Cultural
Centre Theatre .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#120:3>
He carefully placed some newspapers on the pinkish-tiled floor ,
slowly sat down and quietly blended into his surroundings again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#121:3>
Boss and MuiMui lay quietly beside him , his only companions all
through the silent night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#122:3>
When the clock tower at the Star Ferry Pier struck half past twelve
, all the yellow sports lights were switched off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#123:3>
Only the ground lights beside the little palm trees threw up a kind
of blurred white beam .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#124:3>
It was time to rest , to prepare for another day , even though life
seemed to him a kind of meaningless activity , that he lived because he had
to live . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#125:4>
<bold> THE PERFECT DAY </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#126:4>
IRIS EU </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-013#127:4>
Yeah , I  ' m okay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#128:4>
<it> Smile </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#129:4>
Yeah , I  ' m feeling a lot better today .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#130:4>
Guess I slept .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#131:4>
My plans ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#132:4>
Um ... go out with George , I guess .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#133:4>
Yeah , he knows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#134:4>
What ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#135:4>
Yeah ... I told him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#136:4>
He  ' s coming to pick me up at ten .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#137:4>
No , you don't have to call him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#138:4>
He  ' ll be here for sure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#139:4>
We  ' ve got today all planned .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#140:4>
No , ma , go right ahead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#141:4>
Seriously , mom !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#142:4>
<it> Smile </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#143:4>
It  ' s cool .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#144:4>
Don't worry so much !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#145:4>
Look , I  ' m feeling good , okay ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#146:4>
Really .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#147:4>
Now go .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#148:4>
GO !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#149:4>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#150:4>
Tell Dad I said hi .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#151:4>
I  ' ll be home tonight anyway .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#152:4>
<it> Smile </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#153:4>
Man , I swear I  ' m gonna scare Taylor so badly when I walk in like
this ! !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#154:4>
He  ' ll bark like mad , but I guess I can scare him off with the
light I can reflect off my head !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#155:4>
<it> Laugh with her </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#156:4>
No , no I don't need the hat &dash; I  ' ll just go like this .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#157:4>
It  ' s cooler this way anyway ....

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#158:4>
Now GO !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#159:4>
You  ' re late already !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#160:4>
Shoo! !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#161:4>
Nurse nurse ... get my mom out of this room pronto! !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#162:4>
Give her a shot !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#163:4>
I don't care !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#164:4>
Get her out! !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#165:4>
She  ' s harassing a patient !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#166:4>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#167:4>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#174:4>

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#175:4>
Yeah , I  ' m all packed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#176:4>
Glad to get out of here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#177:4>
Even though I  ' ll miss you !

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#178:4>
<it> Smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#179:4>
Yeah , I  ' m okay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#180:4>
The best I can be .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#181:4>
Yeah , okay ... see you late ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#182:4>
<it> Smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#183:4>
Watch her go .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#184:4>
See the door close .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#185:4>
Breathe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#186:4>
Look out of the window .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#187:4>
See the trees , past the bars and the sterile walls .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#188:4>
Past the needles and the treatment and the discomfort .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#189:4>
See past Mom and Dad and George and Taylor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#190:4>
See past the head with long hair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#191:4>
Look at the clouds &dash; how beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#192:4>
A perfect day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#193:4>
See grass and sun and trees dropping leaves .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#194:4>
See past the suffering and pain that close out the pleasures of the
world outside the window &semi; past the bars .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#195:4>
No more bars .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#196:4>
No more pain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#197:4>
No more waiting .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#198:4>
Breathe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#199:4>
Slip the hand into the mattress and reach for the hidden bag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#200:4>
Take it out &dash; pour all of it out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#201:4>
See the small speckles &semi; see the imprints in the specks and the
manufactured name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#202:4>
Roll it in the palm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#203:4>
Don't ask , just do .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#204:4>
Do , because you know there is no other way .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#205:4>
Do because you want to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#206:4>
Count and place each one on the tongue .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#207:4>
One by one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#208:4>
Drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#209:4>
Swallow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#210:4>
Drink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#211:4>
Swallow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#212:4>
Drink , swallow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#213:4>
Drink , swallow , drink swallow , swallow swallow swallow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#214:4>
Count .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#215:4>
Look .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#216:4>
All gone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#217:4>
Fold the bag , place it neatly in the packed bag .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#218:4>
Lie back down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#219:4>
Breathe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#220:4>
Turn the head .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#221:4>
Look at the clouds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#222:4>
Feel the sun .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#223:4>
Breathe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#224:4>
Relax .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#225:4>
Wait .

<ICE-HK:W2F-013#226:4>
Sleep. </it> </p> </I>
