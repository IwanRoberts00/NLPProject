<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-066#1:1:A>
May I please you my Lordship and member of the jury

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#2:1:A>
Now it came to a time that I  ' ll I make my final speech to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#3:1:A>
After that my learned friend <unc> two words </unc> the
defendant will make her speech to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#4:1:A>
And then tomorrow His Lordship will sum up the case to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#5:1:A>
And then from then onwards you will be retired and elaborate and
return a verdict in this case

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#6:1:A>
Now I I shall not be very lengthy in my address to you because uh
this is not a very complicated or difficult matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#7:1:A>
The Crown had not called many witnesses

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#8:1:A>
Just to say a few words as an introduction

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#9:1:A>
In the course of my address I would mention matters of law

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#10:1:A>
But do remember what I say of matters of law you  ' re not obliged to
accept

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#11:1:A>
It is His Lordship  ' s direction on matters of law which you must
accept

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#12:1:A>
However on the other hand you are the sole judge of facts

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#13:1:A>
In other words what I say or what I persuade or push you to come to
a conclusion you do not have to come to the same conclusion as I urge upon
you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#14:1:A>
It is for you to say whether you come to that conclusion

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#15:1:A>
And the same applies to my learned friend  ' s speech and His
Lordship summing up

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#16:1:A>
Because we might express some of our opinions on some matters of
fact

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#17:1:A>
But these are only our opinions

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#18:1:A>
You are the sole judge

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#19:1:A>
It is for you to decide whether you have that opinion or otherwise

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#20:1:A>
Now as I have mentioned and His Lordship has also mentioned it is
the Crown to bring this charge of robbery against defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#21:1:A>
The Crown has to prove that charge

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#22:1:A>
And the standard of proof or the degree of proof is one of beyond
reasonable doubt

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#23:1:A>
In other words after hearing all the evidence seeing all the
exhibits et cetera you say to yourself whether you are sure of the guilt of
the defendant

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#24:1:A>
You should only convict if you are sure of his guilt

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#25:1:A>
If you are left with any reasonable doubt you should give the
defendant the <?> appendences </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#26:1:A>
And he  ' s entitled to <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#27:1:A>
As I have mentioned in my opening <,> this is a case where the sole
issue of fact <,> is whether defendant is the robber or is one of the five
robbers on the twentieth of November nineteen ninety two outside this
Elizabeth House where seven million Hong Kong currency and six hundred
thousand franc were being taken away

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#28:1:A>
I  ' m sure you should have no difficulty to come to a conclusion
from the evidence of PW one PW two and PW three that they were being robbed
of the quantity of money stated in the charge on the day particularised in
the charge outside the place particularised in the charge

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#29:1:A>
Therefore the only issue is was the defendant one of those five
robbers which we have been told about

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#30:1:A>
It is right to say that the Crown in this case do not have any
direct evidence to say that the defendant was one of the five robbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#31:1:A>
The Crown is asking you to draw from the facts which you have been
told about from various witness and from various exhibits that the only
irresistible influence that you can draw is that the defendant was one of the
five robbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#32:1:A>
Now the main witness which you must have your consideration on is
PW eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#33:1:A>
That is Madam Ng

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#34:1:A>
She told you a lot of things about the movement the conduct the
behaviour of the defendant and others prior to the twentieth on the twentieth
and after the twentieth

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#35:1:A>
It is the Crown  ' s case that from these <,> his conduct behaviour
before the twentieth due on the day of twentieth and after the twentieth
asked you to draw and come to a conclusion that he was one of the five
robbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#36:1:A>
Now there are matters which in my submission it helps you to come
to that conclusion

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#37:1:A>
Now if I may begin by first of all you have heard from the victims
that  ' s PW one to PW three <,> that they were being robbed by five people

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#38:1:A>
All actually armed themselves with knife and one with a pistol-like
object

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#39:1:A>
The other one is the driver of a getaway car

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#40:1:A>
So you have heard that there  ' re five robbers involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#41:1:A>
There are three knife being produced in the course of the robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#42:1:A>
There is a pistol-like object being produced in the course of the
robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#43:1:A>
There is a large amount of money being taken away namely Hong Kong
currency and French franc

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#44:1:A>
Then we can see the <.> m </.> Madam Ng  ' s evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#45:1:A>
She told you that it was five people involved in the restaurant on
the twentieth of November nineteen ninety two where money were dished out

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#46:1:A>
And you  ' ve also heard the money that was being dished out which
was taken from her home is only consisted of French franc and Hong Kong
currency

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#47:1:A>
And also large amount

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#48:1:A>
Also from her you  ' ve heard evidence that <,> prior to the
twentieth <,> to be exact on the nineteenth <,> defendant was the one who had
bought three beef knife

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#49:1:A>
And which she identified as similar to the one that was recovered
from the getaway car

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#50:1:A>
FA one o two nine which was parked outside somewhere in Aberdeen

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#51:1:A>
You have also heard from her that Hau Cheun Sum in those day before
the robbery <,> and a pistol-like object <,> she had seen him loading and
unloading the gun

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#52:1:A>
Bypassing I mentioned about the knife

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#53:1:A>
You may feel that the knife which was described by the victims are
slightly different

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#54:1:A>
They say that one is a beef knife but they think the other one
which they see is a a fat end which I believe the company should be known as
A Man of Life as such

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#55:1:A>
But bearing in mind the victims were describing to you what they
have seen in a speed of a few seconds

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#56:1:A>
Because the robbery over in a few seconds

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#57:1:A>
Not only that they are also making an observation under a very
difficult circumstance because they were being held at knife points

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#58:1:A>
And they are struggling with the robbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#59:1:A>
As I say in the my opening you are entitled to accept part of the
evidence and reject part of the evidence

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#60:1:A>
And I would urge upon you bearing in mind the victims are making
their observation in such a difficult situation

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#61:1:A>
There is a possibility and a real possibility that they may have
mistakenly described the other knife of a melon type

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#62:1:A>
The matter should be put beyond doubt because they told you that
they saw the robbers get away in the car MA one o two nine which was later
located in Aberdeen outside the China Motor Bus depot

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#63:1:A>
And inside the car there was this carrier bag Max Mara with three
knife

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#64:1:A>
And they had been produced before you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#65:1:A>
And you can see from those three knives that they are all of a
beef-knife type They are all of the same shape as described by Madam Ng

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#66:1:A>
You have also heard evidence from Madam Ng about the conversation
both before and after the robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#67:1:A>
Remember she told you that before the robbery Mr Hau was telling
the others that they  ' re going to take money from someone who deserved it

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#68:1:A>
And they are preparing the knife and they are <,> loading and
unloading the gun

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#69:1:A>
But not only that

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#70:1:A>
But later on that she also overheard conversation in the restaurant
about an argument to the effect that someone is accusing Hau of choosing the
wrong escape route

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#71:1:A>
They were telling you that they shouldn't be going to the south
district

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#72:1:A>
Now use your common sense

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#73:1:A>
You have heard the victims say that they saw the getaway car gone
off towards Aberdeen area

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#74:1:A>
And in fact it was located later on in Heung Yip Road which is a
south district

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#75:1:A>
Uh these are matters which I would like to address you on so that
to help you to come a conclusion that <,> Mr Hau and his associates which we
say defendant is one of them <,> was discussing about a robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#76:1:A>
And they have prepared the knife and the pistol for the robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#77:1:A>
And on the twentieth from the victim  ' s evidence the same sort of
weapon same sort of people were involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#78:1:A>
Same number of people were involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#79:1:A>
Later on after the robbery same sort of currencies were being
chaired out

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#80:1:A>
You may or may not feel that at the end of the day the hundred and
twenty thousand franc which Madam Ng takes to you <.> wa </.> was it a share
one fifth of the six hundred thousand franc that was taken away from the
robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#81:1:A>
This is a matter for you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#82:1:A>
Although the Crown do not have a direct evidence say that each one
had a equal share

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#83:1:A>
But it  ' s a matter for you whether you feel that

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#84:1:A>
Was it a mere coincidence or was it that must be one fifth of the
share which Hau has been titled

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#85:1:A>
And therefore points to the robbery <,> that had taken place on the
twentieth and served the link there

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#86:1:A>
You also heard evidence from Madam Ng <,> that <,> the robbery took
place according to the victims at about eleven thirty in the morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#87:1:A>
At about twelve thirty she received the call from Mr Hau

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#88:1:A>
Told to go to <.> s </.> meet them in Sing Kong Restaurant which is
within an hour

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#89:1:A>
By that time the bag was in the car and back to her home and she
saw these money

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#90:1:A>
So the time lapse is only a matter of an hour or two hours

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#91:1:A>
Could it be within two hours there had been a number of robberies
in Hong Kong which involved the same sort of currencies

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#92:1:A>
Also their conduct

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#93:1:A>
Once inside <.> m </.> Ms Ng  ' s flat they draw the curtains

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#94:1:A>
They asked Ms Ng to get a radio because they are concerned to hear
the news broadcasted

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#95:1:A>
Not only that they also asked Ms Ng to get them three sets of
clothing to change

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#96:1:A>
Now you might <.> i </.> in my respect was something of these
conduct on them and their behaviour their conversation et cetera must prove
beyond reasonable doubt that they have just committed a robbery

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#97:1:A>
And as I say same number same weapon same sort of currency involved

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#98:1:A>
So that served as link between the robbery they have committed must
be the robbery that took place outside Elizabeth House that morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#99:1:A>
Now I will say a few words so as Ms Ng  ' s evidence is concerned

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#100:1:A>
You may feel that she might be giving her testimony in a very
confusing state of of

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#101:1:A>
There are now I cannot hide from that you have her three
statements before you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#102:1:A>
You can see that there are some inconsistent bits and pieces here
and there

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#103:1:A>
But I ask you to look at this with care

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#104:1:A>
We are dealing with a sever witnesses

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#105:1:A>
No doubt it will what it will create some pressure on her going
through this ordeal of giving evidence in court against people whom she say
she  ' s very frightened of

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#106:1:A>
Remember she told us she had give a number of statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#107:1:A>
Only three were produced before you

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#108:1:A>
And not only that when she gave those statements and I believed
the last one the thirtieth of March you  ' ve heard that by that time Mr Hau
had not been arrested yet

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#109:1:A>
She say she  ' s still in a state of fright

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#110:1:A>
Not only that

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#111:1:A>
There  ' s a mixed feeling in that

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#112:1:A>
You can see from the statement on the eighth of <.> j </.> January
in fact she had told us in her re-examination she was also under arrest
herself for handling stolen goods

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#113:1:A>
She was on police bail

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#114:1:A>
And she had told you of course she is concerned whether she would
be prosecuted

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#115:1:A>
So you can see that she is giving a statement under such pressure

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#116:1:A>
On the one hand she is afraid of Mr Hau and his associates

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#117:1:A>
On the other hand she is afraid that she will be prosecuted for
her role in exchanging the currencies

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#118:1:A>
Her fear of Mr Hau only comes to an end by the end of April when
Mr Hau was arrested

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#119:1:A>
Her concern about the prosecution only comes to an end in August
nineteen ninety three <,> when the immunity was served on her

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#120:1:A>
So you can see that although there are discrepancies between her
statements and her testimony <,> it is understandable why she will have this
discrepancies

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#121:1:A>
Moreover her evidence is supported in my respectful submission by
some independent documents

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#122:1:A>
For example she told you that she <.> lea </.> she left Conrad
Hotel on the ninth November nineteen ninety two

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#123:1:A>
You have seen the record hotel record being produced to you that
that does show the ninth of November

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#124:1:A>
You have heard him heard her telling you that she went on a trip
to Europe and she exchanged the money into Sterling pounds

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#125:1:A>
And then come back to Hong Kong she  ' s exchange those money from
Sterling pounds into Hong Kong currencies <,> after her trip

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#126:1:A>
You  ' ve heard then statements being read to you this morning and
two documentary exhibits being produced to you that does confirm two
transactions of money exchange

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#127:1:A>
One at Aberdeen one at causeway Bay for the what the same amount
that she had told you about

<ICE-HK:S2A-066#128:1:A>
Now these are the independent evidence which the Crown had put
before you to support that Ms Ng is telling you the whole truth and nothing
but the truth </I>
