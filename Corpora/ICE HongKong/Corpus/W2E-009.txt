<h> <bold> Depths of disaster </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#2:1>
Yet another tragic mining accident has claimed more than 100 lives
on the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#3:1>
What is particularly depressing is that the casualty count for
Thursday  ' s disaster in a coal mine in Jixi , Heilongjiang , is likely to
constitute just over one per cent of the mining industry  ' s annual death toll .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#4:1>
That is based on the assumption that about 10,000 people , as in 2001
, will be killed in mines across the country this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#5:1>
Sadly , the assumption can be safely made because there are no
signs that attempts by the authorities to improve safety in the shafts and
close unsafe mines will be effective in reducing accidents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#6:1>
For one thing , the latest mishap has taken place while a
nation-wide campaign on industrial safety is underway , with the month of June
declared &ldquo; national safety production month" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#7:1>
The mine concerned is run by the state-owned Jixi Mining
Corporation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#8:1>
Only in April , an explosion in another mine operated by the company
killed 24 and injured 39 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#9:1>
After Thursday , all mines in Jixi have been closed for safety
inspection , as happened after April  ' s accident .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#10:1>
Hopefully , when they are re-opened , the mines will really be safe .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#11:1>
But past experience has shown that we cannot be too optimistic the
mines will not be struck by another major disaster . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#12:1>
The appalling safety record of the mainland  ' s mining industry
has been attributed to backward technology , corrupt officials ' wanton
disregard for safety , workers ' ignorance and illegal mining .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#13:1>
Unsafe mines are often re-opened with the connivance of corrupt
officials and miners are driven by poverty to go down dangerous shafts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#14:1>
In a notorious case , at least 200 miners were killed when a tin
mine in Guangxi was flooded about a year ago .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#15:1>
Corrupt officials and mine operators conspired to cover up the death
toll , claiming only 70 were killed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#16:1>
The truth was uncovered only after repeated questioning by a
persistent media . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#17:1>
As the high annual death toll suggests , numerous mining
accidents with smaller casualties have gone unreported .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#18:1>
The mainland media would be doing the miners a great service if they
would consistently train their spotlight on the mines to ensure operators
abide by safety rules . </p>

<h> <bold> The start of the end </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#20:2>
The piratical frontman of the Philippines ' most dangerous
criminal gang may be dead , but the nation  ' s poverty-stricken south has not
suddenly become safer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#21:2>
Abu Sabaya  ' s death simply means the beginning of the end of the
Abu Sayyaf , the Muslim extremist group believed to number no more than 60
and linked by the United States to terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden  ' s
al-Qaeda network . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#22:2>
Apart from Philippine Government officials eager for American
military and financial support for their country , few Filipinos refer to the
Abu Sayyaf as terrorists .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#23:2>
The group does have satellite telephones , but its ambitions do not
extend beyond kidnapping foreigners for ransom from tourist resorts and
banditry .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#24:2>
The proceeds are used to buy expensive trinkets , weapons and the
support of impoverished villagers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#25:2>
This is not to belittle the Abu Sayyaf  ' s activities .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#26:2>
They have hurt the Philippines ' tourism industry and turned peaceful
farming communities into war zones .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#27:2>
Thousands of Filipino and US troops are combing the Muslim-dominant
islands of Mindanao , Basilan and Jolo for the remnants of the group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#28:2>
Abu Sabaya was personally responsible for dozens of executions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#29:2>
His shooting on a boat in Sibuco Bay does not destroy the Abu Sayyaf .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#30:2>
They are one leader less , but not finished . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#31:2>
Such groups will only be eliminated when the lives of people in
the southern Philippines improves .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#32:2>
Aid and development programmes implemented by the Government and the
US are slowly making this happen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#33:2>
The strategy must be dedicated and long-term and continue long
after the Abu Sayyaf are wiped out . </p>

<h> <bold> To err is human </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#35:3>
As if it could anticipate the row over the standards of referees
at soccer  ' s premier event , the official magazine of Fifa - soccer  ' s
governing body and organiser of the World Cup - last month focused on &ldquo;
The Team That Cannot Win . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#36:3>
That team refers , of course , to the 36 referees and 36
assistants who have the onerous task of ensuring the rules of football are
adhered to on the field by players who will do everything they can ,
including cheating , to win and bring glory to themselves and their nations .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#37:3>
The anticipation was spot on .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#38:3>
Italy and Spain have both blamed the referees for their losses to
South Korea , one of the co-hosts of the tournament and the first Asian team
to make it to the semi-finals in the World Cup  ' s 72-year history . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#39:3>
Fifa has received so much hate mail from enraged Italian and
Spanish fans that the chairman of its referees ' committee has reportedly
admitted that &ldquo; there have been one or two major mistakes which are
cause for concern" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#40:3>
But then no one should be surprised that Fifa should have
expected that referees would be in the limelight .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#41:3>
As soccer fans know only too well , there has never been a World Cup
in which no games have been tainted by &ldquo; bad refereeing . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#42:3>
To err is human .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#43:3>
That applies especially to the referee and assistants who have to
blow the whistles and wave their flags at the sight of what they believe to
be a foul immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#44:3>
A moment too slow with their reflexes , and the game will have
continued , with unpredictable consequences . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#45:3>
Their decisions may not always be right .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#46:3>
They cannot be .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#47:3>
And with the advent of technology , which allows instantaneous
replays of a foul from all angles , their judgment can be ruthlessly called
into question by officials sitting on the sideline and the crowds watching on
television . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#48:3>
But allowing television replays to help referees make difficult
decisions , a practice already adopted in rugby and cricket , is not the
answer .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#49:3>
What is going to happen after the referee has stopped the game and
the replay shows no foul has been committed ?

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#50:3>
The game will have been ruined and the disadvantaged side will
certainly complain . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#51:3>
Football is a passionate game .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#52:3>
It may be difficult for people to admit that controversial decisions
by referees are one of the reasons why football is so captivating .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#53:3>
But that is the truth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#54:3>
Fifa should try to raise the standards of referees and help them
make sound judgments on the field .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#55:3>
But it would be unrealistic to expect them to commit no errors of
judgment . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#56:4>
<h> <bold> Myanmar  ' s agenda </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#57:4>
Myanmar  ' s junta has kept its promise and given pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi a further taste of the political freedom pledged
after releasing her from house arrest last month .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#58:4>
Her week-long trip outside the capital to bolster support for her
movement is welcome proof of a change of heart within the military . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#59:4>
It is a step , but does not make political freedom more tangible
for Myanmar  ' s impoverished people .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#60:4>
The restoration of democracy , snatched from her National League for
Democracy party after it resoundingly won elections in 1990 , is still a
matter of negotiation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#61:4>
About 1,500 political prisoners remain in prison . Freedom of speech
is still a hoped-for wish . Elections could be years away , if at all . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#62:4>
Ms Suu Kyi  ' s trip to Myanmar  ' s second city , Mandalay , and
other bases of support , is a test of the military  ' s resolve .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#63:4>
If it allows her to meet whom she likes and to openly express her
views , there is reason for hope .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#64:4>
Freedom of expression is , after all , the most fundamental hallmark
of a democratic nation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#65:4>
But there are other crucial features and these remain lacking
under the junta  ' s grip on power .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#66:4>
Last week , a report detailed the military  ' s alleged use of sexual
violence against women as a weapon of war in Shan state .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#67:4>
Other reports in recent months tell of people being forced to work in
the army and factories and mines . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#68:4>
As the world  ' s most prominent pro-democracy activist , Ms Suu
Kyi has a huge burden to shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#69:4>
Expectations for her to win the battle of wills against the junta are
high . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#70:4>
The pressure on the junta is far greater .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#71:4>
Two years of United Nations mediation has only restored some freedoms .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#72:4>
To be fully accepted by the greater world community , it must now
produce and faithfully implement a timetable for change . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#73:5>
<h> <bold> An elusive goal </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#74:5>
Until now , the central Government  ' s line on political reform in
the SAR has been to refrain from dwelling on specifics , merely noting the
Basic Law has set out a timetable for changes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#75:5>
That line has now been changed , with Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
clearly stating that Beijing wants the functional constituency system and
other characteristics of Hong Kong  ' s governmental system to remain intact
beyond 2007 , the year beyond which changes to the current system can be made
under the Basic Law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#76:5>
Mr Qian  ' s remarks should not come as a surprise to anyone .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#77:5>
But it will disappoint those who had hoped for a more rapid
transition to a system of government based on direct elections and universal
suffrage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#78:5>
It may be argued that Mr Qian has done everybody a favour by
quashing any false hope that Hong Kong could make a rapid transition to a
fully elected government .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#79:5>
But his frank remarks may also have damaged the image of Beijing ,
which has been widely acclaimed by the international community for allowing
Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy over the past five years .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#80:5>
From Beijing  ' s point of view , until the last years of colonial
rule , Hong Kong had prospered without democracy for 150 years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#81:5>
After 1997 , the SAR  ' s political system has become more
democratic than ever , as the Chief Executive , unlike colonial governors
before him , is elected by an 800-member body instead of being appointed ,
and half of the legislators are now directly elected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#82:5>
Although Hong Kong has no full democracy , constitutional
liberalism is alive and well , with people enjoying a wide range of personal
freedoms that are denied to citizens of even some fully democratic countries .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#83:5>
As a Special Administrative Region of China , a socialist country
that rejects Western-style democratic government , Hong Kong  ' s advance
towards full democracy will always be subject to the dictates of Beijing .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#84:5>
But the point that must be borne in mind is that the Basic Law
has already promised Hong Kong will ultimately have a chief executive and all
members of its legislature elected by universal suffrage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#85:5>
So the issue should not be a matter of whether but when Hong Kong
will have full democracy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#86:5>
Mr Qian has indicated that Hong Kong  ' s political development
cannot be divorced from that of the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#87:5>
So Hong Kong , as a small part of China , is being asked to slow
down its political development in the interest of the whole country . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#88:5>
This is an issue on which the views of the people of Hong Kong
should be taken into consideration .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#89:5>
Mr Qian  ' s remarks should spark a healthy debate . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#90:6>
<h> <bold> Decision on right track </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#91:6>
Eastern New Territories commuters look to be the biggest winners
from the decision to award the Sha Tin-Central rail line to the
Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#92:6>
Most can look forward to an uninterrupted journey without
time-wasting and stressful station changes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#93:6>
The decision is a victory for sensible transport planning and
looks to be the first step in a much bigger shake-up .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#94:6>
Merging the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the KCRC makes
operational and financial sense . It should stop pointless bickering that has
typified the decision on which operator should get the cross-harbour rail
link . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#95:6>
It is a pity the Government did not consider the merger option
when it privatised the MTRC two years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#96:6>
More than 500,000 shareholders bought into an urban metro with large
property interests .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#97:6>
If merged with the KCRC , they will own something much bigger .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#98:6>
It must be assumed this will leave MTRC shareholders no worse off
than before .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#99:6>
But until more details are provided huge uncertainty prevails . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#100:6>
That the decision to grant the Sha Tin-Central link to the KCRC
was influenced by its lack of reliance on property income is to be welcomed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#101:6>
Last week , the Government announced that rail companies would
receive less land grants in future .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#102:6>
That means alternative funding mechanisms must be considered if
projects are to earn a commercial return . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#103:6>
Fears of reduced competition will inevitably be cited as
reasons not to merge the two firms .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#104:6>
They may not compete directly due to their geographic separation
but awarding the Sha Tin-Central link would have offered travellers a choice
of routes .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#105:6>
So long as a sensible fare-setting mechanism is adopted such issues
can be overcome .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#106:6>
It should involve a mechanistic approach based on inflation and
productivity measures of the new firm .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#107:6>
De-politicising the issue of fares would go a long way to assuage
both passengers and investors concerns . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#108:7>
<h> <bold> Misplaced fears </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#109:7>
The starting point of discussion on Hong Kong  ' s political
development must be the Basic Law  ' s stipulation that the SAR will ultimately
have a chief executive and all members of its legislature elected by
universal suffrage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#110:7>
As the <it> South China Morning Post </it> pointed out in its
editorial yesterday , the issue is not whether , but when , Hong Kong people
should be allowed to choose their leaders through the ballot boxes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#111:7>
Hong Kong already has a free press , an independent judiciary ,
the rule of law , and a largely clean and corruption-free civil service , i.e .
all the elements of a liberal democracy .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#112:7>
The only missing , and arguably most important , element is an
electoral arrangement that allows the people to choose their favourite
candidates to run the government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#113:7>
In his interview with the <it> Post </it> , Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen expressed the central Government  ' s desire for Hong Kong to proceed
slowly towards the goal of universal suffrage , hinting that the SAR should
not go too far ahead of the mainland in terms of political development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#114:7>
But we would argue that under the policy of &ldquo; one country
, two systems" , Beijing has already allowed Hong Kong to operate under a
different set of social , political and economic systems , namely capitalism .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#115:7>
A liberal democracy with an electoral system based on universal
suffrage is part and parcel of capitalism , and an essential element of its
elaborate mechanism of checks and balances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#116:7>
At the heart of Beijing  ' s concern is that universal suffrage
may lead to political instability and make Hong Kong ungovernable .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#117:7>
It is also clearly worried that it may have to deal with a chief
executive whose political views it finds unacceptable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-009#118:7>
But Hong Kong people are a pragmatic lot .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#119:7>
They are sophisticated and mature enough to see where their best
interests lie .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#120:7>
We do not see how they would possibly elect a chief executive or
legislators who advocate independence for Hong Kong or the downfall of
communism in China .

<ICE-HK:W2E-009#121:7>
Nor would the strict perimeters laid down in the Basic Law allow
anyone with those thoughts to put them into action . </p>
