<h> A BIT OF LUCK </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#2:1>
My wife and I were waiting for the bus in Canberra one Saturday
afternoon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#3:1>
It was a sunny day in winter and we were on holiday .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#4:1>
Soon I noticed that a woman sitting next to us was attempting
eye-contact and was on the verge of a smile .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#5:1>
The clement weather brings out the sociable in people , I suppose .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#6:1>
Beautiful day , I said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#7:1>
It transpired that she managed to buy the handbag she was cuddling at
a very low price that morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#8:1>
It was the only one left , and she was clearly very please with
herself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#9:1>
The bag was ghastly , faded plastic and lopsided .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#10:1>
That was lucky of you , put in my wife trying to say something nice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#11:1>
She smile , drew on here cigarette and said , one always needs a bit
of luck in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#12:1>
Mildly eccentric .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#13:1>
But that wasn't it , there was something inexplicable about her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#14:1>
She was clearly older than she seemed , she also had a battered look
about her , also there was an underlying bubbliness which was almost manic .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#15:1>
She chatted on merrily in her very German voice occasionally
flattened by the Australian vowel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#16:1>
At one point her sleeve fell back and there was a number etched on
her forearm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#17:1>
We tried not to react .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#18:1>
She smiled and explained that she was Aryan , not Jewish , she was
thrown into the camps because she was a communist , but she managed to escape
and came to Australia as a refugee .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#19:1>
That was a long time ago , a long time ago , she said , reassuringly .
</p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#20:2>
Mother had just turned seventy , but her hair has gone white a
long time ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#21:2>
There she stands , her shock of white hair blending in its outer
edges with the light of the sun , together they shine like a halo .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#22:2>
Her white tunic gleams down the middle where her bright green mantle
parts at the front .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#23:2>
It looks more like an ecclesiastical cope than a mantle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#24:2>
It drapes , it falls into place , it flows , it plies and bends with
the movements of her body , it sweeps the grass , then it sweeps her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#25:2>
She continues on her way , effortlessly , lightly , as if the cape
grows from her very body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#26:2>
She is one with this magnificent green that seems to shine with an
inner light , that seems to glisten like rows and rows of tiny sequins and
yet its edges glide over the grass as naturally as if it belongs there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#27:2>
The light from behind her head prevents me from seeing her face
clearly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#28:2>
It seems transfused with light .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#29:2>
I crouch into the grass , as if mesmerised .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#30:2>
She keeps approaching where I am without seeming to get very much
closer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#31:2>
Ah yes , she does come closer now , at long last .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#32:2>
Now I begin to see her face clearly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#33:2>
Her black eyes penetrated or so I felt .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#34:2>
I breathed a sigh of relief .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#35:2>
My body sagged , almost sobbing , into a state of complete and utter
abandon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#36:2>
It felt like coming home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#37:2>
Ten minutes ago , still crouching in the grass , I felt a sharp
piercing bite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#38:2>
I started in pain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#39:2>
I then saw a bright green bamboo snake winding its way in big loops
over the grass , its scales shimmering in the sun .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#40:2>
The green bamboo snake is registered as one of the most venomous
snakes in the land .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#41:2>
Help is out of the question .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#42:2>
This is the wilderness and there is no one within reach. </p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#43:3>
There is a black hole at the back of my head which stretches into
infinity .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#44:3>
It is always there , blatantly or latently .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#45:3>
It is there during my waking hours , whether I  ' m walking or sitting
down , working or idling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#46:3>
It is sometimes felt as a lump inside me , sometimes in the throat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#47:3>
Sometimes it causes contraction in the chest , then I would have to
inhale deeply in an attempt to relieve the difficult breathing and to send
the choking feeling as far as possible back to where it belongs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#48:3>
That is , I suppose , referred sensation , not unlike referred pain .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#49:3>
On wintry days I would see it at a great distance , especially
when I close my eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#50:3>
As I begin to get used to the dark , it starts to grow , slowly ,
bigger and bigger , until it gets so big , I find myself in it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#51:3>
It has a tremendous force .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#52:3>
Anything within a certain periphery is lost to its firm , steady ,
inexorable pull .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#53:3>
It enfolds you and you become nothing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#54:3>
All my life , in varying degrees , I  ' ve had to fight off that force .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#55:3>
Constantly afraid that it would swallow me up , I keep my eyes
bulgingly open , on the qui vive all the time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#56:3>
When I reach exhaustion , I drop off for a moment , only to wake up
with a start and a jerk , fearing for my life . </p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#57:4>
The hind-wheel of a double-decker bus wound in a body , squashed
it for a quarter of a mile before the driver knew what had happened and
stopped .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#58:4>
Later , the Medical and Health Department had to go back on that
quarter mile to pick up the flattened bits .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#59:4>
This sort of thing doesn't happen very often .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#60:4>
Normally , people only get dragged along because the driver doesn't
stop long enough for passengers to get off .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#61:4>
Sometimes , heads get a bit fractured or a little broken , at other
times , limbs get trapped or truncated , fingers get subtracted perhaps , but
people don't die that easily . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#62:5>
<h> WHAT MOTHER TAUGHT ME </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#63:5>
I spent the first seven years of my life trying very hard to
learn how not to live .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#64:5>
For I have heard mother say that it was better to be dead than to be
alive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#65:5>
I did not know then that it was only a matter of speaking , that it
was her way of controlling others .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#66:5>
I tried everything and failed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#67:5>
I tried anorexia nervosa , I tried insomnia , I tried constipation ,
I tried all sorts of illness and was sometimes hospitalised , but failed to
stop myself from being alive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#68:5>
Then from aged seven onwards I learnt how not to live even with
staying alive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#69:5>
Now this was easier .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#70:5>
I became so good at it I could slip in and out of non-living very
easily .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#71:5>
The stasis of non-living is beyond time , beyond wear and tear ,
beyond means and meaning . </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#72:6>
<h> THREE MEN IN A LIFT , NOT TO MENTION THE WOAMN WHO DIDN'T GET IN
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#73:6>
It was a University function held at the Art Centre on the
Island .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#74:6>
The Arts Centre is a fifteen-minute walk away from the city centre ,
what the locals call prime-land .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#75:6>
This was for some years the most costly piece of land in the world ,
it is now the third most costly , after Tokyo and London .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#76:6>
The city , represented by the Urban Council , had been hankering
after such a centre for decades , neither private nor public sector paid any
attention , the arts being hardly a lucrative activity .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#77:6>
It was finally built because some clever bureaucrat detected an
angle of space in between two high-rise buildings which could be made into a
triangle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#78:6>
At least it would be a variation on going round and round in circles .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#79:6>
It is aesthetically interesting too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#80:6>
It  ' s like fitting a neat compact Pompidou Centre of a box in
between the legs of a sleeping giant .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#81:6>
And so the New University had seen fit to mix and mingle with the
suave urbanites in their environment instead of holding the reception out in
the wilds of the country-side campus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#82:6>
Guest and university personnel alike were arriving in hordes ,
jamming the triangular lobby , waiting to take the lifts that would take them
to higher triangles .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#83:6>
Men in dark suits , women dripping in jewels and finery jostled
about elbowing their way everywhere .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#84:6>
This was twenty-first century civilisation where a dissociation of
finery from fine manners had firmly set in . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#85:6>
Bringing up the rear , about a lift-load away , was a group of
four trying to make conversation and visibly straining .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#86:6>
I was later to learn that the three men were high-ranking
administrator in a university run by administrators and the woman only an
academic , and a junior one to boot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#87:6>
The unspoken rationale was that any academic who rose high enough in
the ranks would become an administrator .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#88:6>
Indeed , the administration was the university .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#89:6>
Academics were incidental additions as somehow courses had to be
offered and students had to be taught .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#90:6>
The young-looking man on the left was Petronius Ong , recently
Harvard Phd  ' d and positively glowing , now dean of students in one of the
colleges .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#91:6>
The one on the right was Aloysius Jing , just returned from
Cambridge , U.K. , full of praise for &ldquo; the civilised manners of the
English" .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#92:6>
The man in the middle was T.S. Tan , president of one of the colleges , who refers to Lord Todd by
his first name , etc.  etc . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#95:6>
The lift arrived .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#96:6>
People got out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#97:6>
People got in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#98:6>
As the four neared the lift entrance , it became clear there was
only room for three .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#99:6>
As if caught in mid-sentence , for a split second facial muscles
tensed up and the four shared a blank look .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#100:6>
No one actually made a mad dash , they just straightened their
backs and looked vague . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#101:6>
Then everything happened very quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#102:6>
The three men moved towards the lift and just as they did so , the
woman took one big deliberate step backwards .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#103:6>
It was at this point that she caught my eye and we burst out
laughing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#104:6>
She came up to me as I leant against the counter and explained
that that was perhaps the refugee spirit which was so infectious in this
colony .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#105:6>
Three presumably civilised men couldn't resist getting into a lift
as if it was the last lift available , the last meal , the last boat , the
last chance .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#106:6>
You  ' re a journalist , she called to me as she was about to board
an empty lift , write about it , make someone laugh! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#107:6>
There was a last gesture that struck me as interesting .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#108:6>
I wonder if she noticed , perhaps women don't .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#109:6>
That tableau of the lift doors about to close , the three men were
standing in a straight line , all three of them held their hands together in
front of their trousers , as if protecting themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#110:6>
I know , a lot of nonsense has been made of Hitler and his
hands-over-his-crotch pose .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#111:6>
However , can there really be some truth in man  ' s fear of missing
out on a lift ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#112:6>
I  ' ll be damned if I  ' m going to find out ! </p>

</I>

<I> 

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#113:7>
<h> THERE ARE NO MONKEYS HERE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#114:7>
There are no monkeys here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#115:7>
The Water Tower University is spread over several hill-tops and
plenty of greenery , but there are no monkeys .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#116:7>
Over the mountains to he south side of Sann Tien , near the
reservoir , is a sheltered valley where monkeys live and breed; but that is
another place with another story  . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#117:7>
On the evening of the fifth of July , something strange took
place in the undergrowth near residence Number Nine on the campus .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#118:7>
In the midst of the commotion , a monkey shot out with blood on its
mouth .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#119:7>
The followed the shrieks of a female voice interspersed with the
calling of &ldquo; Jake , Jake &rdquo; in the most heart-rending
desperation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#120:7>
Jake came to the Department of Commercial Studies three years
ago .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#121:7>
It was one of those fashionable departments that kept redefining
itself .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#122:7>
No one in the department knew what it was doing , not did anyone
else in the University .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#123:7>
Jake , burly New York Russian Jew , with more than the usual iron
in the blood , came , and saw the opportunity amidst the chaos . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#124:7>
He soon became the head of department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#125:7>
Sometime in the past , he had worked as a bouncer in various
night-clubs in New York and Paris .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#126:7>
The University did not know about this , but they must have
recognised the <foreign> je ne sais quoi </foreign> in him , since what they
wanted was indeed a bouncer for the department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#127:7>
As for Jake , it was a good salary , there was additional perks
, and the campus provided from time to time diversion in the form of
about-to-divorce wives looking for novel perch , any kind of perch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#128:7>
One such was Mrs . Brentshaum , the wife of the Professor of
Morbid Anatomy in the newly founded and much publicised Medical School .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#129:7>
She had been contemplating divorce before she came with her husband .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#130:7>
She came anyway because the Far East was exotic .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#131:7>
Jake was in the process of divorcing his Catholic wife , but she
did not come over with him , even though the Far East was exotic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#132:7>
Mrs. Brentshaum and Jake made love often and well , to the
complete satisfaction of both . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#133:7>
All was going very well until Jake fell in love with a pretty
young girl </p> .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#134:7>
The last time he had anything to do with Mrs. Brentshaum was
the Christmas of two years ago , when , for reasons unfathomable to the
outside , Jake gave her a monkey for Christmas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#135:7>
Whatever symbiosis may or may not have grown between animal and
mistress is anybody  ' s guess .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#136:7>
Occasionally , she was seen carrying the monkey like a nursing
child , walking about the campus with the animal  ' s arms around her neck or
bodice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#137:7>
After some months , Mrs . Brentshaum left the University and
returned to Florida .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#138:7>
Nothing was heard of her since . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#139:7>
The pretty young girl was taut as a stallion , at the same time
, soft as many bags of down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#140:7>
Apparently , Jake had , in private , expressed great joy in her
wonderful breasts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#141:7>
They were firm and shaped to perfection .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#142:7>
Above all , he said , they were topped with a pair of the most
luscious pink nipples . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#143:7>
On that most deplorable of days , on the fifth of July , alas
the day , it all happened then </p> .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#144:7>
After the evening of the fifth of July , the poor girl was left
was only one luscious nipple . </p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#145:8>
It  ' s been snowing heavily and streets with cars and other
things are completely covered with snow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#146:8>
Funny , snow always &obrack;  especially at two in the morning &cbrack; gives a
sense of permanence , unchangingness .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#147:8>
It arrests time and tings stay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#148:8>
Like a flood it covers all and swamps all but unlike a flood it
moves nothing and is in itself unmoving .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#149:8>
It reminds me of a Japanese sand garden with patterns raked into
the sand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#150:8>
It stays for as long as you leave it , then you flatten it and rake
up a new pattern .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#151:8>
Cars come and make furrows in the snow , these stay until other
cars make other furrows . </p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#152:9>
For every mask that we take off there is always one more left
on - an endless recession of masks , of depths of withdrawal .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#153:9>
As long as there is life , there is the ability to recede further .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#154:9>
The self is infinitely reductive and is never reduced to nothing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#155:9>
Alternatively , one can reach one and touch infinitely into the
other person , the other thing , the outside , and having always to reach yet
further  . </p>

</I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-017#156:10>
Unschooled in human relationships , all passions are registered
by their intensities alone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-017#157:10>
The elation of love towards a woman , a man , a chair , a dog
amounts to the same velocity and the resulting excitement will dissipate in
the same way . </p>

</I>
