<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-025#1:1:A>
Good morning <,> ladies and gentlemen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#2:1:A>
Welcome to this land between tour <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#3:1:A>
Uh my name is Sidney and I will be <,> your guide today <,> and our
our driver today uh is uh Mr Kwan

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#4:1:A>
He  ' s a very experienced driver and also especially in this tour so
today uh you just uh <,> relax and enjoy yourself <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#5:1:A>
Uh is my voice okay at the back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#6:1:A>
Is it too loud or or <,> it  ' s okay thank you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#7:1:A>
Our tour is called the land between tour

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#8:1:A>
The land between just means the area between <,> the Kowloon City
and the border of Hong Kong China and uh usually we call that the New
Territories <,> because uh Hong Kong consists of the uh Hong Kong Island <,>
Kowloon Peninsula <,> New Territories and two hundred and thirty-five
outlying islands <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#9:1:A>
And uh <,> first of all I will give you a map <,> showing what we
are going to do today <&> long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#10:1:A>
So uh we  ' re already now in Kowloon

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#11:1:A>
So uh we start our journey now <,> and uh we will first travel to
uh Tsuen Wan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#12:1:A>
Tsuen Wan is the uh first satellite town here in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#13:1:A>
Hong Kong got only an area of a thousand and seventy <.> s </.>
square kilometers <,> and uh <,> we have uh more than seven million people
<,> so the government have to uh develop many new towns <,> and Tsuen Wan is
the first one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#14:1:A>
Later on you will see other new towns in the uh New Territories <,>
like uh Tai Po Fanling and uh Shatin

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#15:1:A>
And uh <,> our first stop will be in uh <,> Chuk Lam monastery

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#16:1:A>
It  ' s a very typical monastery practicing buddhism <,> and uh we
have uh enough time <,> to look at the monastery <,> and uh if you have time
to visit other monastery here in Hong Kong you can compare them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#17:1:A>
Actually today uh we have a tape commentary <,> explaining <,> to
you the things on our way <,> and I just give you uh <,> some more
information

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#18:1:A>
And uh if you have uh any <,> question do not hesitate to ask me
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#19:1:A>
I will try my best to answer your question <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#20:1:A>
After visiting uh Chuk Lam monastery we will <,> travel up to Tai
Mo Shan

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#21:1:A>
Tai Mo Shan is the highest mountain in Hong Kong <,> so we are only
half way up <,> where there is a outlook <,> and there we can have a look in
a harbour and also the uh <.> out </.> some of the outlying islands <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#22:1:A>
Then down the uh <,> Tai Mo Shan we will pass through Shek Kong <,>
to uh Luen Wo Market <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#23:1:A>
Luen Wo market is a very traditional <,> Chinese style market and
uh is uh very interesting especially for the uh Europeans <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#24:1:A>
And then we travel further north towards uh Sha Tau Kok <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#25:1:A>
Sha Tau Kok is a <,> restricted area <,> we can only go inside with
a permit <,> so uh we will turn south to Luk Keng <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#26:1:A>
Later on the tape will tell you more about this uh interesting
place <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#27:1:A>
At Luk Kan in Luk Kan the scenery is uh completely different <,>
with a <unc> 1 WORD </unc> there <,> because it  ' s a protected area
for the birds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#28:1:A>
Then we will pass through a country park uh <,> Plover Cove uh <,>
Country Park <,> further south back we will <,> visit the fishing village

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#29:1:A>
It  ' s uh Sha Mun Jai fishing village <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#30:1:A>
It  ' s a very <,> different from Aberdeen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#31:1:A>
Have anyone of you gone to Aberdeen <,> yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#32:1:A>
Aberdeen is also a fishing village but is now uh <,> develop into
an industrial and uh residential area <,> but uh Sha Mun Jai still keep it as
a <,> uh fishing village so is more quite and uh peaceful <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#33:1:A>
And then we will have a visit to the Shatin Race Course <,> and uh
have our lunch and uh back through the Lion Rock tunnel to YMCA <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#34:1:A>
At at the back of the map <,> is uh what we are <,> going to have
uh <,> this afternoon <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#35:1:A>
If you don't like Chinese food <,> you may also have a choice of uh
sandwich <,> or if <,> you don't like any meat you take you may take
vegetarians and uh later on I will ask uh about your choice <,> and I will
try to arrange with the uh restaurant <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#36:1:A>
Our tour will last about uh <,> six hours so we will be back about
uh three o'clock uh in the afternoon <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#37:1:A>
This area is called uh Yau Ma Tei <,> and uh we are doing a lot of
uh reclamation here <,,> because uh we are going to build the new airport in
Lantau Island

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#38:1:A>
And uh Lantau Island is the uh <,> largest outlying island in Hong
Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#39:1:A>
And uh <,> we have a Buddha monastery and the biggest outdoor
Buddha there

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#40:1:A>
Anyone have visited the outdoor Buddha <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#41:1:A>
No <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#42:1:A>
If you <,> want to pay a visit uh later on I I give you a sample of
the guidebook <,> uh telling you how to explore the Lantau Island by yourself
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#43:1:A>
It  ' s uh very simple just take a ferry from uh Central <,> and then
take a bus to Po Lin monastery <,> and the uh biggest Buddha is just outside
the Po Lin monastery <,> and then you can compare Po Lin monastery with uh
Chuk Lam monastery today <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#44:1:A>
And the new airport <.> i </.> will be also built on the uh Lantau
Island on the northern <,> side of the Lantau Island <,> and then uh we have
a highway and also a airport railway <,> back to Kowloon <,> and in here Yau
Ma Tei we <,> we will have a <,> traffic exchange <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#45:1:A>
We will have a new cross harbour tunnel to the western side of Hong
Kong Island <,> and also the airport railway will go <,> under the harbour to
Central <,> so uh it will be a big project <,> and uh we hope to finish it by
uh nineteen ninety-seven <,> so uh you will see the reclamation start from
here <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#46:1:A>
Originally uh this is the uh <.> ty </.> Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter
<,> but uh it is now relocated further out <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#47:1:A>
And you will see many cargo handling vessel there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#48:1:A>
Besides for the uh traffic exchange it also provide more land for
this uh part of Kowloon <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#49:1:A>
If you <,> are going to visit Hong Kong again next time you may use
the uh new airport <,> anyone planning to visit Hong Kong again after ninety
seven yeah good <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#50:1:A>
Because uh many people ask me <,> my opinion about uh ninety seven
I always answer them <,> it  ' s better for you to see the change <,> because
if even if I given you my opinion it  ' s only my opinion <,> because uh
everybody is hoping for the <.> bet </.> for the best and uh <,> we are only
guessing so it  ' s better for you to see the change

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#51:1:A>
There  ' re some change so uh but but we don't we can't see <,> the
exact change <,> so better for you to come again

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#52:1:A>
That there  ' s no problem for the uh new airport because it takes
you only twenty-three minutes from the new airport back to here <,> so it  ' s
also very convenient

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#53:1:A>
Because uh Kai Tak airport is uh too <,> close to the urban area
<,> so it  ' s no good to have the airport there <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#54:1:A>
This uh Yau Ma Tei is a very uh interesting area <,> with a jade
market here <,> and uh also in the evening we have a Temple Street <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#55:1:A>
Temple Street is uh opened only in the evening from about uh six uh
six o'clock <,> so uh you may <,> pay a visit tonight <,> to the Temple
Street <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#56:1:A>
We have a lot of <,> uh different kinds of market here here in Hong
Kong the jade market the uh Temple Street and also uh Stanley market

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#57:1:A>
Anyone visit Stanley market yeah it  ' s a very interesting market
Stanley market <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#58:1:A>
And also uh <,> we have a <,> the uh <,> ordinary markets uh for
the uh foods and uh <,> later on you will see a very interesting one <,> it  ' s
a temporary one

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#59:1:A>
And uh nowadays uh we have uh some uh modernized uh complex <,> the
lower floors are for the uh markets and the upper floors are for other uses

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#60:1:A>
So uh first of all you will try to look at the street <,> there  ' s
a lot of people gather there <,,> next street you will see a lot of people
<,> gather there they actually it  ' s a temporary market <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#61:1:A>
People in uh other country may sometimes like to buy the things uh
<,> maybe once a week and keep it in the uh refrigerators <,> but uh here in
Hong Kong the housewife uh <,> like fresh food <,> they will go to the market
now and get the food <,> to prepare for the lunch <,> and uh in the afternoon
about four o'clock <,> they will go there again to get the food <,> to
prepare for the dinner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#62:1:A>
And uh between this two time uh that is just like an ordinary
street <,> but uh they will gather together twice a day to form a temporary
market <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#63:1:A>
Of course uh nowadays uh we have the modernised market <,> and the
upper floors are for the uh badminton court <,> uh squash court uh libraries
uh dancing rooms or gymnasium <,> to uh <,> uh the Hong Kong people <,> know
how to make use uh every space <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#64:1:A>
But uh Luen Wo market is uh always there <,> it  ' s the uh it  ' s now
the only <,> traditional Chinese market in uh New Territories

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#65:1:A>
Long time ago in New Territories there are more than one of <,>
that kind of market but now we keep only keep uh Luen Wo Market <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#66:1:A>
And also uh we we will uh we have uh <,> flea market uh in uh Shek
Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#67:1:A>
Later on we will pass through Shek Kong <,> and uh flea market is
only open on uh Fridays Friday morning because uh Shek Kong is quite <,> away
from the urban area to to form a special market every morning for the
soldiers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#68:1:A>
Later on the tape will tell you more about this uh Shek Kong Army
Camp <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#69:1:A>
We also have a flea market in uh Repulse Bay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#70:1:A>
It  ' s open in uh Saturday and Sunday only <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#71:1:A>
Uh this area is uh <,> Tai Kok Tsui called Tai Kok Tsui <,> uh this
flyover this side is uh very densely populated <,> but on the other side you
may find some uh industrial building <,> so they are too close together <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#72:1:A>
That  ' s why we have to develop some uh new towns for the industry
<,> and also for the people to live <,> especially in uh Tai Po we have a
very large area for the Tai Po industrial estate <&> BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#73:1:A>
Uh you see uh some high-rise building there those buildings are the
uh <,> houses uh public housing provided for the by the uh government <,> for
the low income people <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#74:1:A>
We have uh two main kind <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#75:1:A>
Uh one is for rental <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#76:1:A>
The others uh will be sold to the uh low income people <,> at a
much lower price than the uh market price <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#77:1:A>
Later on uh in a new town uh we will see a lot of this kind of uh
public housing

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#78:1:A>
We have uh six million people and uh <,> more than half of the
population about three million live on public housing <,> so uh there  ' s no
problem for the people here in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#79:1:A>
But the private <,> housing is uh very expensive <,> uh <,> for
example the uh usual price is uh <,> uh maybe here <,> Hong Kong dollar five
thousand <,> per square foot <,> so I am standing on uh five thousand <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#80:1:A>
But uh but most uh low income people they they will get a house
from the uh government so there  ' s no problem <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#81:1:A>
Of course uh if you want to invest you may buy one <,> uh for
yourself <&> BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#82:1:A>
Uh you see a <,> island there <,> and uh that is uh Stonecutter
Island

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#83:1:A>
That  ' s the only island uh inside the Victoria Harbour but is no
longer an island now because of the reclamation <,> and we are going to build
a new container port there <,> so we can drive a car to the uh island <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#84:1:A>
So the number of island is uh <,> decreasing in Hong Kong <,>
because uh reclamation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#85:1:A>
Later we will see the uh Kwai Chung container port <,> and uh the
extension uh one more will be uh built in Lan uh Stonecutter Island <,> and
the others are planning in uh Tsing Yi Island and also Lantau Island <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#86:1:A>
Somebody ask me where the Lantau Island is <,> later on uh in uh
<,> in Tai Mo Shan outlook I will show you where it is but on this map you
will see part of the Lantau Island <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#87:1:A>
It it  ' s here <,> just a very small part <,> the whole <.> Lan </.>
Lantau Island is uh <,> uh double the side of Hong Kong Island <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#88:1:A>
That  ' s only the uh north eastern part of the uh Lantau Island <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#89:1:A>
Here there is a lot of uh <.> hi </.> uh residential building here
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#90:1:A>
It is a private housing

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#91:1:A>
It is not public

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#92:1:A>
It is private

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#93:1:A>
It  ' s originally belong to the <,> <.> Mob </.> Mobile Oil Company
but it  ' s now moved to Tsing Yi Island and uh this is uh <.> re </.>
developed into a residential <,> areas

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#94:1:A>
It may be a surprise to you that uh they are all together ninety
nine blocks <,> ninety nine blocks so we need some <,> space for <,> taking
<unc> 1 WORD </unc> so there  ' s a swimming pool there and a sporting
centre <,> and also a Chinese <unc> 1 WORD </unc> there <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#95:1:A>
So this is the uh Kwai Chung Container Port <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#96:1:A>
It  ' s uh number one to uh seven here number eight uh in a some kind
of island <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#97:1:A>
It handles uh more than uh nine million <,> standard <unc> 2
WORDS </unc> units <,> so it is the uh world busiest uh container port
<,> because uh we have uh great business with all the country all over the
world and also are re-entreport and and the uh goods from China we were <,>
to <unc> 1 WORD </unc> Hong Kong as an entrepot

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#98:1:A>
After passing through this uh Kwai Chung Container Port we are now
directing to uh Tsuen Wan and the tape will tell you more about uh this uh
first satellite town Tsuen Wan <&> Long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#99:1:A>
So uh we are now going to the uh Chuk Lam Monastery

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#100:1:A>
Chuk Lam means uh bamboo forest <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#101:1:A>
Plenty of name uh here in Hong Kong is difficult for you to
understand because uh just translated from the Chinese word so uh Chuk Lam
means uh bamboo forest <,> because a long time ago here is a just a bamboo
forest <,> and the monks and nuns uh find this a very good place to build a
monastery so uh in nineteen twenty seven <,> they uh start building uh this
monastery <,> but you will find the monastery still quite new

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#102:1:A>
It  ' s quite new because uh most part was built in nineteen
eighties but they still keep a hall and that was built in nineteen twenty
seven

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#103:1:A>
We have uh <,> uh half an hour stay here <,> and uh for the first
uh fifteen minutes I will try to explain the uh things to you and uh the
other fifteen minutes uh you will have time to take photos uh yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#104:1:A>
And if you want to take photo of the people the monks and nuns
there please ask for their permission first <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-025#105:1:A>
This is a very typical monastery so I try to uh explain to you the
uh technical things here so that you you may compare with the other monastery
here in Hong Kong </I>
