<ICE-HK:S1B-015#1:1:A>
During the last lecture we  ' ve talked about the output and
expense which are available for deduction under salary tax <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#2:1:A>
All output and expense when they are not of domestic private or
capital nature and they are in wholly exclusively and <?> hurry </?> incur
for the production of accessible income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#3:1:A>
With qualify for deduction from the accessible income of a tax payer

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#4:1:A>
And they will continue to look at this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#5:1:A>
The first uh the CAR the commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued a
departmental uh departmental interpretation and practice note number nine
which talk about uh all the allowance sections for uh for accessible income
under salary tax

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#6:1:A>
And uh a number of specific items has been mention okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#7:1:A>
So let  ' s go through this items within the special <?> input </?> of
it <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#8:1:A>
The first specific item being mentioned by the uh departmental
interpretation note is the <?> reinvestment </?> of expense <?> reinvestment
</?> of expense <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#9:1:A>
When the employee is required to work say away from uh his <?>
normal base </?> of work and he has uh some uh he has incur port on
subsistent traveling and accommodation

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#10:1:A>
And if the employer <?> reinverse </?> an reasonable amount to him
in order to cover such cost <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#11:1:A>
Usually the <?> reinvestment </?> of such expense they are not
accessible they are not accessible <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#12:1:A>
But this case only apply when the employee is uh required to
working away from his usual working base

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#13:1:A>
For example if usually he  ' s working in Hong Kong and then he is uh
<unc> one-word </unc> to work in China for a couple of weeks et
cetera

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#14:1:A>
Then almost uh uh cost which used as incur on subsistent traveling
and accommodation while he  ' s working away from Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#15:1:A>
Then the <?> reinvestment </?> of such expense would be <,> uh
would be uh would not be accessible under salary tax

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#16:1:A>
If it is reinvestment of any other expense and those expense does
not qualify for deduction that means it does not satisfy the tax as provide
under section twelve subsection one A that means they are not at uh wholly
exclusively and necessarily incur in the production of income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#17:1:A>
Then the reinvestment of such expense would be taxable would be
taxable okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#18:1:A>
Only reinvestment of such uh reasonable uh <.> re </.> uh
reinvestment of expense would not be accessible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#19:1:A>
And if the tax payer that is the employee claim for uh expenses
which are <?> insensitive </?> <?> inexpensive </?> of the reinvestment
usually the <?> plain </?> the <.> de </.> uh the claim of expense for
deduction would not be qualify because it will fail the necessarily tax <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#20:1:A>
So if the expense is not necessarily incur then of course it won't
be qualify for deduction from the accessible income of a tax payer <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#21:1:A>
This is the first specific item mention under the note <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#22:1:A>
And the second one is professional subscription <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#23:1:A>
If anyone is a member to a professional body then of course he he
is required to pay a professional subscription annually

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#24:1:A>
Generally speaking <,> this professional subscription is not
deductible is not deductible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#25:1:A>
Because uh it is not incurred in the production of income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#26:1:A>
You pay subscription only because you are a member of a
professional body okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#27:1:A>
You does not incur the subscription while you are performing your
duties okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#28:1:A>
So strictly speaking the professional subscription does not qualify
for deduction

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#29:1:A>
It fail the tax as provided under section twelve subsection one A

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#30:1:A>
But in factors in factors the Inland Revenue Department as a
concession will allow will allow deduction of subscription to one
professional body to one professional body if the following tax are satisfy
if the following tax are satisfy

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#31:1:A>
So even you are a member to more than one professional body then
you are <.> onl </.> only entitled to deduction of subscription to one
professional body only

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#32:1:A>
And the tax are the first tax is if the holding of the professional
qualification is the prerequisite of the employment <,> holding of the
professional qualification is the prerequisite of the employment that means
you must be a member uh to the to a professional body before you are employed
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#33:1:A>
This is one of the tax and uh second the second tax is <,> when
retention of membership and keeping a rest of the current development in that
particular profession they are of regular use and benefit in performance of
the duties <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#34:1:A>
Then uh only if both tax are satisfied then the subscription to
that professional body will be allow for deduction <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#35:1:A>
For example if you are a member of the Hong Kong <?> S A </?> and
then if if you work in a audit firm as an auditor then usually this deduct uh
this uh subscription will be deductible <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#36:1:A>
But before uh of course before are allowed for deduction the Inland
Revenue has to examine whether you satisfy both conditions or not okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#37:1:A>
So if you are a professional uh if you are in the profession of a
say a doctor okay you are with profession body but you work as a citizen okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#38:1:A>
So that professional body in in fact is uh does not of regulate you
and benefit in the performance of your duties the knowledge in that
professional

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#39:1:A>
In that case the uh Inland Revenue can <?> prejudge </?> the
deduction and because it does not satisfy both conditions as lay out <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#40:1:A>
And in order to qualify for deduction you must a full member you
must be a full member of the professional body

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#41:1:A>
As a student member you would not be qualified for the deduction
<,> even it is prerequisites for the employ <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#42:1:A>
And also under the <.> de </.> departmental interpretation and
practice note number nine <,> the commissioner has listed out a number of
employees who are uh in a number of employments a flat rate allowance

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#43:1:A>
This flat rate allowance is provided because uh uh the Inland
Revenue want to reduce the time in examine those numerous frames on uh small
items on small items

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#44:1:A>
The first flat rate allowance provided is a flat rate of seven
hundred dollars seven hundred dollars to cover the maintenance of equipment
<,> to cover the maintenance of equipment to members of the following bodies

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#45:1:A>
This included the first one is the <?> Royal </?> Hong Kong
Regiment <,> any member of the <?> Royal Regiment </?> can claim a amount of
<.> sub </.> seven hundred dollars for maintenance of his equipment and
second one is the Auxiliary Police Force Auxiliary Police Force and third one
is the Auxiliary Fire Services <,> and Auxiliary Medical Services Civil Aids
Services the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force <,> as well as any uniform
members any uniform members of the Immigration Department the Royal Hong Kong
Police Force the Fire Services and Trade Industry and Customs Department <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#46:1:A>
And in order to qualify for deduction that it is you must be a
uniform member of the of these <?> four </?> government departments

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#47:1:A>
If you are only uh say a clerical staff there you don't have to
wear uniform of course then you can't claim the deduction

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#48:1:A>
Because the the flat rate allowance is to cover the maintenance
cost of the special equipment to <.> si </.> uh the following members of the
following body <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#49:1:A>
But uh of course the tax payer they have right to claim more so if
they think that seven hundred is not enough for the real maintenance cost
they have incur in relating to his employment then he could claim more but uh
he has to provide evidence

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#50:1:A>
Okay he has to provide evidence to the Inland Revenue Department in
order to substantiate his claim <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#51:1:A>
And this seven hundred dollars would be granted if any uh the
members of the following bodies has claimed the maintenance cost

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#52:1:A>
Uh they don't have to submit any evidence to the <?> set </?> of
this

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#53:1:A>
And another flat rate allowance is a flat rate of five hundred
dollars five hundred dollars in order to cover the cost of uniforms each
woman charge et cetera to those sea <unc> one-word </unc> airline
pilots and crews and the airline crews

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#54:1:A>
Because of the special nature of their employment uh they may need
to uh incur a cost on the uniforms and instruments or special charge they
have to use

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#55:1:A>
And a uniform <?> growth </?> of five hundred dollars is allowed
for sea <unc> one-word </unc> the airline pilot and air crews <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#56:1:A>
And again if the claim for more they have to substantiate the claim
by providing evidence <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#57:1:A>
The departmental interpretation and practice note number nine also
provide a number of specific items <,> also mention a specific I a list of
specific items uh for the treatment of the deduction

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#58:1:A>
Uh <.> throu </.> I go through this very quickly because you can
read them up in the appendix in your appendix nine in the <unc> two-words
</unc> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#59:1:A>
So first of all it  ' s a clothing

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#60:1:A>
Usually uh any expense on special clothing in relation to
employment

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#61:1:A>
For example for those actors or the singers if they have incurs uh
expense on the clothing usually this is not allowed because they did not
qualify for the tax <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#62:1:A>
Usually they uh you cannot qualify the tax wholly exclusively and
necessarily incur in the production of income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#63:1:A>
And however if it is a replacement of uh special clothes which is
required by the employment then this may be uh deductible okay any on special
circumstances

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#64:1:A>
And then commission pay any commission pay in earning your income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#65:1:A>
And again usually this is not deductible but only if uh the the
payment of commission is uh is really directly related uh to obtain of an
income then it will be deductible otherwise it won't be deductible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#66:1:A>
It must be directly pay in order to obtain <?> sick </?> a contract
et cetera in early income

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#67:1:A>
And entertainment expense again usually this is not deductible
unless unless it have it is unnecessarily incur unless it is necessarily
incur

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#68:1:A>
And when claim an entertainment expense you have to provide for
example the details of the name of the puzzle you are entertaining and also
the nature of the business that you have been transacted uh from spending
this entertainment expense et cetera okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#69:1:A>
So the tax is very straight and in order to qualify you have to
provide all the details to the Inland Revenue Department

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#70:1:A>
And the payment to assistants payment to assistants again usually
this is not this is not necessary incurs so uh usually this is not deductible
but again if uh if you can prove to the uh <,> a Inland Revenue Department
that uh due to the last volume of the work you are <?> involve </?> and you
are earn on the commission bases that means the more transactions then you
will earn more uh then the payment for this uh assistant may be deductible
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#71:1:A>
If you can prove that uh this is uh expense having deduct to the
large one of transactions and as result of this by hiring assistants you can
earn more income and it may be deductible and subscription to professional
societies so we have mention this already okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#72:1:A>
Uh as a concession this will be deductible when the both conditions
are satisfied and also any travel expense and the use of <,> a motor car

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#73:1:A>
Any travel expense from home to office of course it is private
expenditure and won't be deductible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#74:1:A>
However uh if it is due to nature of employment that employee needs
to <?> travels </?> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#75:1:A>
He he need to travel a lot and incur a travel expense and if the
employer does not reverse the expense then uhm usually the travel expense may
be deductible if it can satisfy the tax of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#76:1:A>
And if he provide his own car he  ' s provide his own car to travel
the travel trip is employment then uh <,> we may apportion we may apportion
uh his travel expense between uh the expense which is incur of business
purposes and for private purposes

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#77:1:A>
Lastly it  ' s the use of the standard <.> prem </.> premises

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#78:1:A>
Uh this is very rear okay when an employment requires an employee
to work uh to work at home that means there is no office provided

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#79:1:A>
Uh then if this is the necessary requirement then only the save the
additional cost of the <?> light take </?> <unc> one-word </unc> et
cetera incur will be deductible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#80:1:A>
However if a specific area are distinct and separate area in his
home has been use for the employment of the carry out of his work or the
performance of the duties

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#81:1:A>
Then may be apportion of the rent and rates pay may be deductible
that depends on circumstances

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#82:1:A>
So these are the list of items which are specifically mention under
the <.> de </.> departmental interpretation and practice note <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#83:1:A>
Other than the output and expense there is another deduction
available under the Inland Revenue Ordinance and this is provided under
section twelve subsection one B

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#84:1:A>
And this is the depreciation allowance for capital expenditure
depreciation allowance for capital expenditure <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#85:1:A>
It must flat of any capital expenditure incur on plant and
machinery common eight uh common example of plant machineries are motor
vehicle motor vehicle okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#86:1:A>
And the use of <?> supplant </?> machinery is essential to the
production of income is essential to the production of income that is it is
essential to the performance of duties <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#87:1:A>
Then the depreciation allowance on such capital expenditure would
be deductible would be deductible

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#88:1:A>
You can see there  ' s some <unc> one-word </unc> of tax
provided under section twelve subsection one A

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#89:1:A>
This is a more simple the tax is much simpler here okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#90:1:A>
You can see that we only have to satisfy one tax which is as long
as the plant machinery is the use of such plant machinery is essential to the
production of income or is essential to the performance of duties

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#91:1:A>
Uh then the depreciation allowance will be qualified for deduction

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#92:1:A>
So there is no such tax as are wholly necessary and uh exclusively
incur in the production of income as long as you can prove that it is
essential the use of such is essential

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#93:1:A>
Then it will qualify the deduction <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#94:1:A>
And there are special rules there are special rules provided under
the Inland Revenue Ordinance in computing the depreciation allowance in
computing depreciation allowance on plant machinery

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#95:1:A>
And this is mention under part six under part six of the Inland
Revenue Ordinance

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#96:1:A>
Uh and later you would learn the details of this so I won't discuss
this again <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#97:1:A>
As I  ' ve mentioned the tax provided under this <?> section </?> is
is much simpler as compared with the tax provided under section four one A

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#98:1:A>
So apportionment of depreciation allowance if specifically allowed
is specially allowed under section twelve subsection two

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#99:1:A>
That means if your plant machinery for example your motor vehicle
they are used both for private and business purposes then when you compute
the depreciation allowance uh we would apportion the depreciation allowance
and only those portion which is <?> applicable </?> to business purposes will
be uh deducted okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#100:1:A>
So if you use uhm your motor vehicle half a business purpose and
half for private purpose then only half of the depreciation allowance will be
qualified for deduction <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#101:1:A>
This is provided under section twelve subsection two <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#102:1:A>
And <?> upon </?> disposal of the plant abd machinery uh uhm we
have to compute a balancing adjustment according to part six of the Inland
Revenue Ordinance

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#103:1:A>
The balancing adjustment uh is either a balancing allowance or
balancing charge

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#104:1:A>
In respect of balancing charge it is treated as an additional
income because balancing charge uh roughly speaking is the excess of
depreciation allowance granted

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#105:1:A>
Excess of depreciation allowance granted on that particular plant
and machinery okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#106:1:A>
So because uh in uh in do of the Inland Revenue Department has
write the excess depreciation allowance on the particular plant of machinery

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#107:1:A>
Upon disposal of that plant of machinery the balancing charge will
be included as an additional income under section twelve subsection five <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-015#108:1:A>
So you have to be careful although you don't know how to calculate
exactly how to calculate uh the the depreciation allowance and also the
balancing adjustment et cetera but uh whenever you see the word balancing
charge make sure you add this back to your accessible income </I>
