<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-053#1:1:A>
The very first thing I have to do is introduce <,> this factory
to <,> my friend you two and this is the factory of Amway

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#2:1:A>
And some people wondering are we working for Amway this <,> factory

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#3:1:A>
The answer is no

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#4:1:A>
Amway is just a factory

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#5:1:A>
It <.> pro </.> it is producing goods <,> for us to sell <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#6:1:A>
Okay now you are looking at picture

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#7:1:A>
This is the picture <,> of this factory and uhm <,> it is located in
<,,> in the United States uhm <,> so called Michigan something like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#8:1:A>
And here is the lake

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#9:1:A>
This this lake is owned by this factory and most of the products of
Amway products <,> have to <,> be produced by water <,> so they have to <,>
uhm have their own lake to supply own water

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#10:1:A>
Okay next one next page and here is <,> some little bit background
about Amway <,> factory

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#11:1:A>
And it started by a very <,> hard <unc> 1 WORD </unc> in
<unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> of a petrol station

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#12:1:A>
And here  ' s uh Peter Island <,> for the people recognition and some
people do <,> pretty good and they <,> they will be invited by Amway <,>
factory to enjoy their <,> holiday on there

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#13:1:A>
And here  ' s the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#14:1:A>
And it is only <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#15:1:A>
And all around here you can see <,> uhm in in the world around
around the world about forty countries and place and cities uhm <,> there are
Amways on there <,> so like Canada like Australia like <,> British like <,>
uh Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#16:1:A>
And in Hong Kong it  ' s it is started by nineteen seventy-four <,>
and going here and you are don't <.> wor </.> you don't have to worry about
this picture <.> ju </.> <,> just some people worry about that how many goods
we can sell <,> how many goods we can take from Amway factory and then we <,>
we we tell to the customer

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#17:1:A>
When you see up here you can <,> you  ' ll know there  ' s a lot of
product and the very big variety of course we can choose to sell and you
don't have to sell them all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#18:1:A>
but you just choose one of them or you can sell them all just up to
you

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#19:1:A>
Like home care product <,> SAA is the best laundry product of the
in the world and it is a truth and it  ' s <.> prov </.> it is uh proven by
some <,> department or some <,> company or some research

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#20:1:A>
And <,> here is also some <?> of our </?> laundry products <?> foam
for the </?> uh carpet and here  ' s the metal cleaner <,> and here  ' s
<unc> 2 WORDS </unc> for windows

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#21:1:A>
And <unc> 1 WORD </unc> of housewife uses every day <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#22:1:A>
And some cookware

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#23:1:A>
This is a set of cookware and a very <unc> 1-word </unc>
one and it save a lot of energy and it <,> doesn't need lot of water and <,>
<?> you just </?> use a lot of food and it save the water save the water <,>
water in the food and keep the food <,> in a high nutrition <,> quality

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#24:1:A>
And some <,> knives some chief knife some shearing <,> and scissor
<,> Chinese wok

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#25:1:A>
And this wok is produced only by <,> for I mean only produced for
<,> the Asian market

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#26:1:A>
It  ' s because the Chinese Asian people they use they use the wok to
cook the food <,> so the Amway factory produce it for us for Asian

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#27:1:A>
And here  ' s very potential product <,> nutrition

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#28:1:A>
If people need the nutrition every day it <unc> 2 WORDS
</unc> that very <,> good enough nutrition from the food <,> in their
meal every day so they have to be get some more supply <,> extra

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#29:1:A>
And uh like this is for weight <,> this is weight controlling and
this is for nutrition product like <,> vitamin C vitamin B daily <,> chewable
for children <,> and even some uh <,> calcium and <unc> 1 WORD </unc>
it is for <,> uh for bones or people just like it  ' s also for women

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#30:1:A>
Uh <,> and here  ' s some protein powder for the uh developing
children <,> someone like and a lot of goods

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#31:1:A>
And here  ' s some personal care product <,> like uh perfume like eau
de toilette like <,> <.> s </.> uh some <,> bathing product or here  ' s some
cosmetic product

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#32:1:A>
And all the product <,> here <,> it is need by people everyd ay so
we don't have to worry about people buy it only one time and don't want to
buy it any <,> the other time

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#33:1:A>
And all the product of Amway <,> is totally <,> uhm protected if
you buy if you don't satisfy you can <,> take a refund <,> an one hundred
refund

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#34:1:A>
So <,> it <.> ens </.> it is assured it is uh one hundred good
quality <,> for the customer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#35:1:A>
Okay this is the part of <,> Amway factory it is produce goods like
that

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#36:1:A>
And what we  ' re doing

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#37:1:A>
All we are doing is the following like <,> Amway as as I told you
it is it is just a manufacturer and in a traditional way like conventional
way a <.> convent </.> <.> con </.> conventional way people use <,> used to
put the goods in the exporter and then sell it to the importer and go go
through <,> wholesaling go through retailing and then the consumer will get
it

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#38:1:A>
Just like what I what I write in the board what <,> here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#39:1:A>
While the goods go through all here they have to take a very big
cost like uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#40:1:A>
In every step they they have to employ some people <,> and they
have to employ a lot of uh <,> people to help them to sell the goods to next
stage

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#41:1:A>
Like advertising like land they have to hire off they have to land
the office <,> they have to uh put a lot of money on advertising and they  ' ll
let the exporter know it

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#42:1:A>
And the and then the exporter know it and also do the same thing
<,> like the manufacturer did and then sell it to importer

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#43:1:A>
So <,> like here the cost is <,> extremely high for the <.> goo
</.> products <,> probably the products is only a little money <,> when you
cost <,> just produce <,> from by the manufacturer but <,> when the product
go through all these stage <,> the consumer will get a <,> probably higher
price <,> even it is not worth

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#44:1:A>
So it is the <,> idea of <,> distributor idea of direct sale

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#45:1:A>
That  ' s why the direct sale idea is coming out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#46:1:A>
When the manufacturer produce good just go through the <,> people
distributors like me <,> and it go through go through me and <.> con </.> the
consumer can buy the goods from me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#47:1:A>
And it is the thing <,> we do and the thing manufacturer do

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#48:1:A>
They export the thing by themselves they <,> they they can afford
this one the transportation cost <,> and we don't have to <,> pay the cost of
<,> land we don't have to rent the land for <,> for shops we don't have to
put in money <,> capital big capital for buying a lot of goods

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#49:1:A>
It  ' s what we <?> do </?> buy it uh a big amount of <.> goo </.> of
goods <,> we just <,> buy what we need to do we do

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#50:1:A>
We just buy the amount what we need to sell to people so <,>
capital is not a big problem <,> for distributor

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#51:1:A>
And also we don't have to employ any people so labor <,> we are the
boss also we are the labor we are just doing thing by ourselves <,> so we <,>
also take out the cost of labor and also we don't have to <,> worry about the
management of our business

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#52:1:A>
It  ' s because all we  ' re doing is doing by myself <,> we don't have
to manage that we don't have to hire a lot of people executive people to <,>
manage my company <,> and all the capital here <,> is very <,> risky <,> you
can you can lose them all <,> at one night time

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#53:1:A>
So <,> why would why people doing Amway distributor it  ' s what they
don't afford they don't want to <,> afford this kind of risky <,> cost risky
<,> capital <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#54:1:A>
So that  ' s why we  ' re doing it

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#55:1:A>
Okay <,> some people will be uh will may be ask <,> why the Amway
distributor don't have a shop and don't <,> they don't employ people and they
don't have a lot of capital how they can do it a big business <,> even <,>
bigger than people who owns a shop <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#56:1:A>
And <,> here  ' s the answer <,> and in Amway in in the Amway plan
there  ' s nine ways of income <,> the very <,> third the very first way is <,>
retailing profit <,> that  ' s mean when we buy a goods and we sell it and we
will gain a profit <.> a </.> <,> at once and we don't have to wait and we
don't have to uh <,> wait for wages wait for labor of months we just sell it
and we  ' ll get the profit

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#57:1:A>
And <,> the other thing is performance bonus <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#58:1:A>
Performance bonus is calculated by <,> uh monthly

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#59:1:A>
And the third thing is four percent leadership bonus and today I  ' m
going to explain this these three kind of bonus I  ' m not going to explain the
<.> oth </.> <,> the other in this way it take a lot of time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#60:1:A>
Okay <,> now <,> I have to say what is retailing profit <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#61:1:A>
A retailing profit is <,> when you buy <,> when you buy the goods
from the factory <,> and the price have to be fixed and when you sell it to
your friend your consumer your customer and the also the consumer price is
also fixed already

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#62:1:A>
You don't have to adjust that and you are not allowed to adjust
that it  ' s what it  ' s keep a fair market <,> so when you <,> when you buy it
and sell it you can earn <,> at least or around thirty percent <,> around
thirty percent probably sometimes twenty-nine point nine or sometimes it  ' s
<,> thirty-two point something

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#63:1:A>
So <,> thirty percent is retailing profit <,,> so <,> I think all
it is quite easy to be understand <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#64:1:A>
Okay the other thing is performance bonus

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#65:1:A>
Performance bonus is a little bit complex a little bit complicated
so <,> you can pay more attention on it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#66:1:A>
Uhm let me say in this way

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#67:1:A>
The inflation is a very important thing for the whole society it  ' s
because <,> when inflation coming up the wages it is very hard to chasing up
<,> very hard to check catch up the the inflation rate so <,> we don't
calculate our business volume by money

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#68:1:A>
We  ' re calculating our business volume by point value

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#69:1:A>
This is point value and it is like <,> this is a <?> dishmop </?>
for uh dish <,> <?> perhaps I can draw it more </?> better <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#70:1:A>
This is uh for dish cleaning

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#71:1:A>
You  ' re washing the dishes we use this one <,> probably it is <,>
thirty dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#72:1:A>
This one when I sell it and <,> I can't say it is my volume <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#73:1:A>
My point volume is <,> probably something two point <,> or three
point may be I don't <,> <unc> several-words </unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#74:1:A>
It  ' s because next year <,> the money the price of this product
have to be adjusted <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#75:1:A>
It  ' s because the inflation <,> is coming up to every year so
probably next year is thirty-five maybe forty or maybe more or maybe less

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#76:1:A>
So <,> it is <,> when it is floating we just shift to point value
and it is fixed

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#77:1:A>
Two point is two point and forever it  ' s two point and never change

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#78:1:A>
So <,> get what I mean <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#79:1:A>
And five hundred point here that  ' s mean <,> here  ' s the <,> amount
of product it totally <,> is five hundred point value <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#80:1:A>
Uhm <,> if there is a good <,> when you sell <,> out in my term I  ' m
not going to say I have thirty dollars of business I have <,> three point or
two point or four point or ten point of business of the point value

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#81:1:A>
So <,> you can get what I mean now

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#82:1:A>
And the performance bonus is according <,> to your point value

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#83:1:A>
There <,> is the product <,> as I told you

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#84:1:A>
If you sell it <,> now you can get thirty percent <,,> by yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#85:1:A>
And also there is a percentage is given by Amway <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#86:1:A>
If you can if you if you take a lot a lot of goods <,> uh like if
you can take five hundred point <,> value of <,> product from Amway factory
<,> and the factory will give you another three percent <,> another three
percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#87:1:A>
And this is performance bonus

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#88:1:A>
I think you can <,> understand what is performance bonus by this
word

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#89:1:A>
Performance is mean is according to what your performance is <,>
every month

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#90:1:A>
So Amway is giving you this monthly

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#91:1:A>
This is three percent and the lowest is three percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#92:1:A>
If your point value is lower than five hundred you get nothing <,>
and <,> one thousand and eight hundred and you can get six you can get six
percent and thirty-five hundred and nine percent and up to twenty-five <,>
thousand you can get twenty-one percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#93:1:A>
It is the highest and some people may be asking <,> how about I get
<.> fif </.> fifty thousand when you you also get twenty-one percent

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#94:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#95:1:A>
It  ' s because <,> the highest that you can get twenty-one percent
<,> altogether you are getting fifty-one percent and you are <,> now you  ' re
earning much more than <,> a little bit more than the factory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#96:1:A>
And the factory is just earning an <,> forty <,> forty-nine forty
nine percent only

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#97:1:A>
So <unc> 1 WORD </unc> one percent <.> fo </.> <,> for
everybody it is very high <.> re </.> high return <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#98:1:A>
Okay let  ' s do a new step <,> to calculate

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#99:1:A>
Now maybe <.> as </.> assume you that you now you are <,> Amway
distributor <,> and you will know <,> probably you can pay more attention on
that

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#100:1:A>
And assume that you <,> you are distributor and this month <,> uh
this is the first <,> month <,> and the first month you <,> only you <,> you
don't do anything and you try to <unc> 1 WORD </unc> by yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#101:1:A>
You buy it from the Amway factory <,> and you try to use it and
you think you think if I if I don't satisfy with that <,> I would I can <,>
just get a refund <,> and you are secure you don't have to <,> <?> you don't
you don't have </?> to go through the risk <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#102:1:A>
Only you <,> you buy or sell some people sharing the goods <,> to
your friend one thousand point value <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#103:1:A>
And one thousand point value usually how much of product we <,>
used to buy is nowaday <,> one point value is equal to <,> two point seven
dollar <,> two dollar seventy cents <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#104:1:A>
Can you get what I mean

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#105:1:A>
That means <,> this month <,> only you <,> you have one thousand
point value just mean <,> time two point five seven dollar two point <,> two
point seven dollar <,> is <,,> twenty-seven hundred business volume <,>
business volume

<ICE-HK:S2A-053#106:1:A>
Hope you  ' re not confused now </I>
