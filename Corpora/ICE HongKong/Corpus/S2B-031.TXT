<ICE-HK:S2B-031#1:1:A>
Let me first tell you about a trivial incident

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#2:1:A>
The other day I took a cab home from work

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#3:1:A>
The driver reminded me to put on my seat-belt and I thanked him

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#4:1:A>
This was a rational conversation

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#5:1:A>
He did not assume that I would take it as an insult

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#6:1:A>
I did not think he was questioning my knowledge of the law or my
intention to comply with it

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#7:1:A>
I know you expect me to discuss serious issues like the Public Order
Ordinance perhaps or the rule of law or democracy

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#8:1:A>
Well in fact I am talking about all of these and about political
leadership and the free press into the bargain

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#9:1:A>
Because I want to tell you what I have been thinking about on
rational debate which underlies them all

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#10:1:A>
Whatever is happening to rational debate everyone agrees it is fast
disappearing in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#11:1:A>
Even Mrs Regina Ip has recently told us that but for her motion in
Legco there would not have been any rational debate on the POO

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#12:1:A>
Now we would all agree that it is important for the community to
have a habit of rational debate

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#13:1:A>
Whatever our creed or political inclination we are united in our
abhorrence of violence and tyranny

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#14:1:A>
We have seen enough of violence in recent world history to be
totally appalled

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#15:1:A>
And tyranny and violence go hand in hand

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#16:1:A>
The prevention of violence and tyranny must be the most pressing
aim of politics in all civilized societies

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#17:1:A>
Now all this is familiar to us

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#18:1:A>
I have just finished reading the intellectual autobiography of my
teacher Professor Joseph Agassi

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#19:1:A>
In it he discussed the contribution to political thinking of his
teacher Sir Karl Popper the author of The Open Society and Its Enemies

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#20:1:A>
I was very struck by the simplicity of what he said

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#21:1:A>
For example democracy is defined as any regime in which the
governed are able to overthrow those who govern them without bloodshed or
revolution

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#22:1:A>
So the fundamental appeal of democracy is it renders violence
unnecessary

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#23:1:A>
Agassi says Popper  ' s book is not a direct defense of democracy but
of the open society

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#24:1:A>
Democracy is defended as the political tool most likely to achieve
the desired end of keeping society increasingly open so that its members are
increasingly free

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#25:1:A>
You may recall that Popper is the philosopher who makes fallibility
not infallibility the central and distinguishing character of science

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#26:1:A>
Agassi adds on to Popper by tackling the practical question of
political leadership

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#27:1:A>
Everyone is interested in finding the right leaders and setting out
what should be their tasks

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#28:1:A>
We may never know for sure of finding the right leaders whether by
democratic or by other means

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#29:1:A>
But democracy allows a community to correct its mistakes and learn
from them in the least costly and most promising way

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#30:1:A>
It is better to replace the wrong leader than to be stuck with one

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#31:1:A>
Democracy is about the control of the leadership by the led

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#32:1:A>
This is a very important message for me

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#33:1:A>
Hong Kong has no system as yet to elect its government

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#34:1:A>
So in Hong Kong is not possible as yet to have democratic exercise
of executive power

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#35:1:A>
But even in Hong Kong even under the present system we can achieve
a high degree of democratic control of power

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#36:1:A>
And this would go some way towards the elimination of violence and
tyranny

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#37:1:A>
This should be our political agenda

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#38:1:A>
And Agassi said this which I like very much <,> without an
alternative he said the only solution no matter how bad wins

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#39:1:A>
One task of a responsible leadership is to notice the absence of a
contingency plan or the poverty of the existing contingency plans and to
cater for the development of one

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#40:1:A>
And this requires discussion and discussion requires political
parties and a parliament with a legitimate opposition and a national
consensus and caucuses and lobbies and more

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#41:1:A>
I suppose a free press and lively critical commentators

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#42:1:A>
Taking the meaning of nation as broad enough to cover the Hong Kong
SAR under the One Country Two Systems Principle this view too is applicable
to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#43:1:A>
This shows how the different components of our political structure
can work together through rational debate towards a society which is stable
and free from violence and threats of disintegration

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#44:1:A>
A democratic system allows the participation of the greatest number
of people

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#45:1:A>
Since apart from the minimum civic duty of obeying the law
political responsibility is all voluntary

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#46:1:A>
Different individuals and groups can take on greater or smaller
responsibilities some may take on responsibilities only occasionally and on
specific issues

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#47:1:A>
But the <.> par </.> participation of maximum number of people and
groups of people each acting autonomously does not have to result in the
chaos that some people fear

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#48:1:A>
It so happens that Hong Kong together with the rest of the world
has just witnessed a powerful demonstration of democracy working in the most
dramatic of American Presidential elections

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#49:1:A>
Consider the extreme vigorous contests the highly visible divisions
the pangs and the headaches yes I hear you laugh but mark this the rules
operated in their normal way produced the resolution and in one moment the
integrity of the American nation re- emerged brought together again by the
speech of the loser conceding victory to his opponent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#50:1:A>
To borrow a phrase the golden thread that runs through all this is
rational debate

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#51:1:A>
You see I  ' m almost done

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#52:1:A>
A debate presupposes a question and at least two views which are
critical of one another

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#53:1:A>
You can have a debate without a conclusion but you cannot have a
debate without at least two views to the same question which are critical of
one another

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#54:1:A>
In other words where democracy is the agreed mode criticism and
genuine disagreement is indispensable

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#55:1:A>
And this fact is as crucial to the government as to the opposition

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#56:1:A>
We have to understand that criticism is not necessitated by bad
government

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#57:1:A>
Criticism is necessary to rational debate and to democracy itself

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#58:1:A>
So the government never need to take criticism as an implied insult
or inchoate indictment

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#59:1:A>
Likewise the government  ' s critics never need to couple even the
strongest criticism with hostility

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#60:1:A>
We don't have to despise the government to criticize it

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#61:1:A>
On the contrary without respect criticism is impossible

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#62:1:A>
We can only turn our back on what we despise

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#63:1:A>
I suspect it is this mistaken view of criticism which is pushing
rational debate towards its extinction

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#64:1:A>
Terms like confrontation indicate such a mistaken view

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#65:1:A>
It really identifies criticism with hatred and contempt

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#66:1:A>
Equally endangering is the view that any criticism must aim at
undermining the authority of the party criticized

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#67:1:A>
When a government insists on the unquestioned acceptance of its
authority and therefore tries to stifle criticism in the name of stability
and control then room for rational debate quickly disappears

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#68:1:A>
It is when there is no room for rational debate that conscientious
people will have to resort to means such as civil disobedience and that
quickly brings us to the brink of violence because a government which cannot
tolerate criticism will tolerate civil disobedience even less

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#69:1:A>
So we all have a stake in promoting rational debate and that begins
with the appreciation of critical speech and thinking </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-031#70:2:A>
Dear Carol Legco  ' s session has just come to an end

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#71:2:A>
The debate on the Chief Executive Election Bill took ten hours and
as you know on the most controversial clause involving the CE  ' s removal by
the Central People  ' s Government the government  ' s proposal carried

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#72:2:A>
We now have in our statute books an astonishing provision

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#73:2:A>
The effect is that apart from the expiry of his term or upon his
death Hong Kong can only declare a vacancy and hold an election for his
successor if the Central People  ' s Government gives the go ahead

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#74:2:A>
It does not matter if the CE has resigned or disappeared without
trace or has fallen into a permanent coma

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#75:2:A>
So long as Beijing has not gone through the motion of removing him
the SAR will not be able to declare a vacancy as a matter of law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#76:2:A>
Conversely if CPG removes a Chief Executive from office then Hong
Kong SAR must declare a vacancy and hold an election unless the government is
prepared to maintain that the removal is contrary to the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#77:2:A>
Now how likely do you think that this is going to be

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#78:2:A>
The amendment proposed by Audrey Eu and I was defeated

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#79:2:A>
We were at a loss why the government would oppose us

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#80:2:A>
For ours was a perfectly simple and neutral proposal

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#81:2:A>
It does not raise the question of the power of CPG to remove the CE
at all

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#82:2:A>
So it cannot be said that it was too wide or too restricted as
represented in our law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#83:2:A>
We simply say that the function of the clause is to provide that
when the CE  ' s office has become vacant then an election must be held

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#84:2:A>
We then provide for two situations the anticipated vacancy upon the
expiry of a term and the <.> unan </.> <.> anticipated </.> vacancy arising
before the term expires

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#85:2:A>
This is because the election arrangements are slightly different in
each case

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#86:2:A>
But that  ' s all you need for the purpose of the bill

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#87:2:A>
We made this proposal because we thought it was wholly unnecessary
to get embroiled in the sensitive issue of the power of CPG particularly when
the government has embarked on a course which denies Hong Kong  ' s autonomy
under the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#88:2:A>
The Bar and the Law Society were unanimous in pointing out that the
government  ' s understanding on CPG  ' s power to remove the CE was wrong

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#89:2:A>
Professor Albert Chen who  ' s a Dean of HKU Law School and a member
of the Basic Law Committee wrote to the Secretary for Justice to tell her
that the government  ' s approach was wrong and our proposal was sound

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#90:2:A>
And no one can ever accuse Professor Chen of being disrespectful of
the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#91:2:A>
Even Michael Suen Secretary for Constitutional Affairs admitted in
the debate that our approach was right

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#92:2:A>
Why then did he for the government oppose it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#93:2:A>
His answer was this

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#94:2:A>
Our amendment he said does not make it clear beyond doubt when the
CE  ' s office has become vacant

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#95:2:A>
So that there is uncertainty leading to delay and confusion

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#96:2:A>
But we said and another member Andrew Wong explained with great
patience vacancy is a matter of fact

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#97:2:A>
Whether the CE  ' s office has become vacant or not is a question of
fact

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#98:2:A>
Most of the time it would be quite plain and obvious

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#99:2:A>
Other times it may be less straightforward

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#100:2:A>
But the determination of questions of fact is very much part of
normal life

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#101:2:A>
Other governments in the world have no problem telling that the
office of their head has or has not become vacant

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#102:2:A>
The Hong Kong SAR Government seems to be the only one who finds
this difficult

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#103:2:A>
Yet as Michael Suen was speaking I saw the light

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#104:2:A>
The real difference between our proposal and his is that according
to our amendment the Hong Kong SAR determines as a matter of fact whether the
CE  ' s office has become <.> wac </.> vacant

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#105:2:A>
In the government  ' s amendment this is decided by the Central
People  ' s Government by an exercise of its authority

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#106:2:A>
I must admit I was dumbfounded

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#107:2:A>
If in taking this position the government was acting on Beijing  ' s
instruction Hong Kong  ' s autonomy would be only an illusion

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#108:2:A>
If the government was acting on its own the clear message to us or
to Beijing is that it does not want to take any responsibility for making a
decision or any risk of giving the impression that Hong Kong is acting too
independently or trespassing on Beijing  ' s prerogative

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#109:2:A>
The government will wait to be told

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#110:2:A>
A government which can think like this is despicable indeed

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#111:2:A>
You see it is the business of governments to take responsibility

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#112:2:A>
So it is the business of Legco the legislature of <?> a </?> Hong
Kong SAR to take responsibility

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#113:2:A>
So each of its members must take responsibility to vet bills to
reduce error and to make improvements where we can and to insist on upholding
what is right and in the public interest even if we are doomed to fail

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#114:2:A>
I was asked by a reporter whether I didn't think I was too
narrowly confining my interest to legal issues and to the rule of law and
whether I shouldn't take greater interest in what concerns ordinary people

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#115:2:A>
But to me law concerns vast numbers of ordinary people in the most
direct and even drastic ways

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#116:2:A>
For example when a criminal offense is given too wide a definition
numerous innocent people may be caught

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#117:2:A>
When you persuade the government to target illegal bookmakers
rather than making a criminal of everyone who places a bet with him you are
trying to save ordinary people as well as our system of criminal law from
abuse

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#118:2:A>
When laws are bad people suffer

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#119:2:A>
This can happen with bad gambling law as well as bad copyright law
or law regulating investment and commercial activities

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#120:2:A>
We need good laws to protect rights whether these be labour rights
or consumer rights or rights against a violent spouse or against racial
discrimination

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#121:2:A>
It is our responsibility as lawyers or lawmakers to make the law
serve the people

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#122:2:A>
This also means making the law clearer and more user-friendly so
that it makes sense to ordinary people at least in most of the areas in which
they are most directly affected

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#123:2:A>
We have a long way to go and so far the battle has been uphill

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#124:2:A>
So I shall be glad of the summer break

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#125:2:A>
In the penultimate motion debate of the session Martin Lee had
chosen an ecumenical <,> motion if I may put it that way on the elements of a
world class city

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#126:2:A>
Many members spoke of the importance of the rule of law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#127:2:A>
I thought this was an apt occasion to sum up as it were my
experience of the session and I spoke of the respect for reasoning in the
tradition of the rule of law

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#128:2:A>
Geoffrey Robertson Queens Counsel who was in Hong Kong recently to
represent the right of abode seekers in the Court of Final Appeal explained
in his book The Justice Game why he liked his life as an advocate

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#129:2:A>
Because he says in the justice game the rules ensure that the side
with the best argument wins

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#130:2:A>
When the side with the best argument wins people will seek out
reason and evidence

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#131:2:A>
When power wins every time and reason is defeated constantly the
rule of law will not for long endure

<ICE-HK:S2B-031#132:2:A>
Your worn-out friend Margaret Ng </I>
