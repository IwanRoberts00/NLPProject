<bold> When will I be famous ? </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#2:1>
Bad publicity is better than none at all when you  ' re young and
ambitious .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#3:1>
<bold> Christine Chan </bold> talks to Hong Kong girls who hunger for
fame . </h> <O> Four photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#4:1>
THE first thing wannabe actress Michelle Wong does after sitting
down in the caf&eacute; is reach for a newspaper .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#5:1>
A smile appears on her delicate face as the 23-year old finally finds
a photo of herself in the entertainment section . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#6:1>
&ldquo; Too bad the picture makes me look ugly , &rdquo; she says
of the shot taken during the <it> Super Manager </it> television contest .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#7:1>
&ldquo; But it  ' s still better than no reports on ma at all .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#8:1>
The good thing about entering this kind of showbiz competition is that
you have the chance to be spotted and become an actress . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#9:1>
Wong is one of the hundreds of young Hong Kong women who are
willing to endure virtually any humiliation in game shows and competitions in
order to get noticed and win a singing or acting contract .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#10:1>
They eat live spiders , put snakes down their trousers and endure
relentless bullying from the show  ' s hosts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#11:1>
To many of them , becoming a movie star has been a dream since
childhood .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#12:1>
&ldquo; I knew how to pose in front of a camera even when I was a
little girl , &rdquo; says Wong , who was born and brought up by Hong Kong
emigrant parents in Los Angeles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#13:1>
When she was 15 , a mainland TV station that was filming a series
called <it> Broadway 100 </it> in Los Angeles picked Wong for a small part
and she spent a month in front of the camera .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#14:1>
Her acting debut was followed by hosting a mahjong programme on an LA
TV station .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#15:1>
Next she tried her luck in a modelling competition , but nothing came
of that .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#16:1>
Her big break came in 1998 when she finished first runner-up in the
Miss Asia beauty pageant organised by ATV in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#17:1>
That led to some work in broadcasting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#18:1>
&ldquo; I stayed with ATV &obrack;  mainly hosting afternoon shows aimed
at housewives &cbrack; for about two years , but I didn't get many jobs , so I went
back to LA , &rdquo; she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#19:1>
&ldquo; When I heard about the <it> Super Manager </it> contest a
few months ago , I came back and decided to stay on in Hong Kong and try my
luck in showbiz again . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#20:1>
Small-time beauty pageants are becoming obsolete in most parts of
the world , but in Hong Kong , they  ' re still going strong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#21:1>
The Miss Hong Kong pageant receives around 2,000 applicants every
year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#22:1>
This year , even established model Rosemary Vandenbroucke had her eye
on the crown , before quitting at the last minute for fear of breaching her
modelling contract . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#23:1>
Apart from prizes that include a car and a mainland apartment ,
the big draw for most women is the promise of fame . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#24:1>
&ldquo; I think participating in Miss Hong Kong is really a good
way to get into showbiz , &rdquo; says Rosa Chan , the deputy project manager
of TVB  ' s Miss Hong Kong Pageant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#25:1>
Chan says that in the two months leading up to the final .
Contestants are given good coverage in the press .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#26:1>
And for those among them who are interested in showbiz , the contest
offers a great opportunity to test their talents and get an understanding of
television production . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#27:1>
Nobody can blame the contestants for having starts in their eyes;
Hong Kong beauty pageants have produced numerous success stories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#28:1>
A long list of local movie stars kick-started their careers in the
swimsuit segment of beauty pageants - among them ward-winning actress Maggie
Cheung , Michelle Yeoh and Anita Yuen , as well as Christy Chung and Michelle
Reis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#29:1>
Like most of her fellow contestants , this year  ' s Miss Hong Kong
finalist Bondy Kwong did not even try to hide her real motives for entering
the competition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#30:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m a model and participating in beauty pageants is good for
my career because more people can get to know me , &rdquo; she said when she
made it to the final round . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#31:1>
She was right , but things didn't quite turn out the way she
planned .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#32:1>
The day after she was quoted , a picture of Kwong smoking a cigarette
appeared in the entertainment pages of the local press , triggering
widespread criticism .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#33:1>
She has since been hounded by the paparazzi and the pressure , she
says , has made it difficult to sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#34:1>
It hasn't , however , been enough to force her to abandon her dream
of becoming a star . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#35:1>
The 40 contestants of <it> Super Manager </it> have demonstrated
even greater determination .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#36:1>
Fighting for a movie contract , they are willing to do whatever the
organiser asks of them - whether it is appearing in tiny bikinis or eating
lizards like Winnie Au-yeing did . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#37:1>
&ldquo; I saw other girls eating lizards first , but when my turn
came , I did not have a chance to refuse , &rdquo; recalls Au-yeung , 28 , a
part-time actress .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#38:1>
&ldquo; Although the cook Chan Tung guaranteed the lizard was edible
, a strange feeling remained in my stomach for a few days .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#39:1>
If there is one moment of the competition that I won't forget , that
is it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#40:1>
Sadly , Au-yeung  ' s bravery has not yet paid off with a coveted
showbiz contract , although it  ' s still early days .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#41:1>
The competition closes in September . However , the <it> Super
Manager </it> formula has served as an inspiration for others . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#42:1>
Recently , YMC channel of Cable TV started a new
search-for-new-stars competition , featuring contestants such as 15-year-old
Maggie Ho .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#43:1>
She had sent a job-seeking email to showbiz agency Stareast , where
she was given a part-time modelling contract and then encouraged to sign up
for the star-search competition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#44:1>
Ho is delighted at the opportunity , but not all superstar
hopefuls feel the same way , especially after the fact . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#45:1>
Julice Chu , another <it> Super Manager </it> contestant ,
regrets having given up time she should have spent preparing for her HKCEE
examination . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#46:1>
&ldquo; I had very good school results this year , &rdquo; the
18-year old form five student says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#47:1>
&ldquo; My teachers are very disappointed , and can't believe that
their best student had gone to join <it> Super Manager </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#48:1>
&ldquo; I knew that my public examination results would not be
good .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#49:1>
If I could turn the clock back , I would concentrate on my studies .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#58:2>
<bold> Cheers , my dears </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#59:2>
Hong Kong  ' s first cheerleading competition is certainly bringing out
plenty of perky energy among enthusiastic Britney Spears wannabes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#60:2>
<bold> Lim Li Min </bold> and <bold> Natalie Kan </bold> feel better
just watching the giggling young ladies </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#61:2>
IN a holding room at a Causeway Bay hotel , 28 girls in scarlet
tank tops and white skirts prepare for Hong Kong  ' s first cheerleading
competition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#62:2>
They have practised hard for this , and only the last-minute make-up
flurries and nervous giggles betray just how high feelings are running . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#63:2>
The prizes are tasty: there  ' s a &dollar;1,000 in cash for the
second runner-up; &dollar;2,000 for the first runner-up , and for the winning
cheerleader , &dollar;3,000 plus a two year modelling contract with the
talent agency Stareasy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#64:2>
But behind the surface , there  ' s much more than the allure of hard
cash and a covergirl reign at stake . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#65:2>
Two weeks ago , the majority of the girls were &ldquo; newbies" ,
fresh acolytes in the world of high kicks and pom-poms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#66:2>
Most have never performed in public; a few have mimicked Britney
Spears , but only in the privacy of their bedrooms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#67:2>
Tonight , they stand to rack up a fifth of their total marks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#68:2>
The final tally comes after the competition draws to a close at the
weekend in Victoria Park .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#69:2>
The girls will be awarded points for their enthusiasm , routine ,
smile and presentation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#70:2>
But the bulk of what they know about cheerleading will have been
gleaned from watching corn-fed blonds do rah-rah choruses in American movies .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#71:2>
Some eight two-hour practice sessions later and ready or not ,
these girls - mostly local , timid and not used to attention-drawing displays
of behaviour - will have to step into the spotlight and claim these
made-in-the-USA chants and dance steps as their won . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#72:2>
&ldquo; I  ' m thrilled that we  ' re working together as a team ,
and we  ' re going to be just perfect , &rdquo; enthuses Deanne Siqueira ,
director of the New York Fitness gym , where the girls have trained . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#73:2>
Then she flashes a megawatt smile and hollers: &ldquo; Everybody
ready to rock and roll ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#74:2>
<it> Then give yourself a pom-pom </it> ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#75:2>
It  ' s 15 minutes before they  ' re ready to go on , and the girls are
waving their silver pom-poms in the air like their lives depended on it .
</p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#76:2>
The air is heady with the faint smell of perspiration and scent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#77:2>
There  ' s glitter dust everywhere - the girls are encouraged to be
innovative with their costumes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#78:2>
So an imaginative lass is sporting a dog collar made of sparkling
sequins; lots of girls have attached a silver band to the hems of their tops;
one has a bejewelled navel ring .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#79:2>
&ldquo; Oh my God , I  ' m so glittery , I  ' m like Barbie ! &rdquo;
giggles Patricia Chiu , 18 , as she brushes past leaving a cloud of sparkles .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#80:2>
The girls ' Australian coach and New York Fitness trainer ,
Samantha Robinson nods and beams for her final pep talk .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#81:2>
&ldquo; You know the routine .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#82:2>
If you make a mistake , don't worry .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#83:2>
Have fun , smile , and everybody will think you look fantastic  ' cause
you do ! &rdquo; she says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#84:2>
Then it  ' s the breathless five-minute wait behind the curtains
before they come onto the hotel nightclub  ' s dancefloor .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#85:2>
A Mexican wave of chimp-like hoots is already bouncing across the
room . &ldquo; Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-OOH ! , &rdquo; it goes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#86:2>
And then the girls are off , knelling on the floor in position , then
rising to their feet and extending their pom-pom-ed arms to a mixed
compilation of <it> It  ' s Raining Men </it> , Ricky Martin and <it> Let  ' s
Get Loud </it> at eardrum-shattering levels . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#87:2>
And the result ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#88:2>
It  ' s decidedly mixed bag .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#89:2>
The best three girls are lined up in front , going through the
motions with professional ease , grinning like Cheshire cats and eyeballing
the judges confidently .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#90:2>
The desired effect , like their bum-skimming skirts and modest tank
tops &obrack;  showing a little puppy fat &cbrack; is sexy , yet wholesome at the same time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#91:2>
Likewise with the shoulder shimmying and buttocks wiggling athletics
- it  ' s meant to be titillating , but not overtly so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#92:2>
The stragglers are at the back , wooden , awkward and concentrating
very hard .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#93:2>
One , to put it bluntly , looks as if she  ' s just stepped off a
horse; the other has her young , unblemished brow puckered up with the sheer
effort of it all .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#94:2>
This is a definite no-no in cheerleading circles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#95:2>
&ldquo; You want them to look as if they  ' re definitely into it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#96:2>
No nervousness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#97:2>
You  ' re supposed to whip up enthusiasm , &rdquo; says one of the
judges , Derek Yeung , CEO of she.com .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#98:2>
There are five male judges , all tapping their pens just as
enthusiastically , and one lone female judge who looks as if , she too , is
concentrating very hard .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#99:2>
She is jotting down notes assiduously .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#100:2>
You wonder what  ' s going through the judges ' minds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#101:2>
Is the pen-tapping , like the note-taking , a professional
cover-up , for what is admittedly tame fare ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#102:2>
Unlike American cheerleading , which features feats of acrobatics ,
this is more a Mickey Mouse Club affair - with the added glitter dust and
pom-poms , of course . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#103:2>
The United States is the undisputed home of cheerleading .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#104:2>
The bible of the cheer world , <it> American Cheerleader </it>
magazine , is ready by more than 1.3 million teenage girls .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#105:2>
Ninety-five per cent of cheerleaders are female but there are some
dedicated males who also do a combination of &ldquo; double nines , hurdlers
and pikes" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#106:2>
Robinson knows all this but is proud of how far her girls have come .
</p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#107:2>
&ldquo; The girls are just fantastic now , &rdquo; she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#108:2>
&ldquo; You should have seen them when they started , how some of
them had two left feet ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#109:2>
In a minute , the dance routine is over , and the girls pile
upstairs , exhausted and red-faced .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#110:2>
Chiu , who was all hyped up and pumped before the show , is now
pooped , and glides across the room with a slightly glazed look in her eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#111:2>
Koryl Schneyder , 22 , who used to cheerlead at her American high
school , gasps: &ldquo; My mouth was dry and I couldn't breathe . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#112:2>
A quick run around the room reveals modest aspirations; Connie
Chow , part-time model and the current favourite to win the competition ,
says she joined because she &ldquo; wanted to keep fit" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#113:2>
Likewise with Jaja Poon , 21 , a Form 5 graduate and full-time model .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#114:2>
&ldquo; I like it here because all the girls are very nice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#115:2>
I like the contest - it  ' s fun and I want to have lots more fun .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#116:2>
It  ' s not enough ! &rdquo; she giggles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#117:2>
Almost half the girls seem to have done some camera work or
cat-walk modelling , but none , strangely enough , will admit to knowing what
the glittering stakes are . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#118:2>
&ldquo; I joined this for fun - I haven't even thought about
becoming famous , &rdquo; Poon says , wrinkling up her pert nose . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#119:2>
&ldquo; Like , whatever , &rdquo; as Kirsten Dunst , who played
a cheerleader in the film <it> Bring It On </it> , might say .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#120:2>
The world  ' s celebrity cheersters include Madonna , Franklin D
Roosevelt , Samuel L Jackson , Ronald Reagan , Sandra Bullock .

<ICE-HK:W2B-008#121:2>
For tonight , the girls are in good company . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-008#122:2>
<it> The Beach Volleyball Cheerleading Competition finals take
place on Saturday , 6:30-8:30pm , and Sunday at 10am and 1.30pm , at Victoria

volleyball championship </it> </p>
