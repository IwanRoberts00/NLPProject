<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X58:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X62:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#63:1:A>
Private tutoring

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#64:1:A>
Actually I have to you know to help the children <,> to study

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#65:1:A>

Uhm <{> <[> just </[> like English and Mathematics

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X68:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X69:1:Z>
English and Mathematics </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#70:1:A>
Yes because they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#71:1:A>
Normally they find difficulties in these two areas

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X72:1:Z>
Oh really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#73:1:A>
Yes and you

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#74:1:A>
Have you been a private tutor before

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X75:1:Z>
Uh yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X76:1:Z>
I have taught some <,> Spanish before </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#77:1:A>
Spanish <{> <[> in </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X78:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X79:1:Z>
Spanish </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#80:1:A>
Uh you know Spanish

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X81:1:Z>
Yes I know Spanish </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#82:1:A>
Uh <,> actually I don't like

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#83:1:A>
I don't know Spanish

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#84:1:A>
I  ' ve just know <,> uhm Cantonese English and Mandarin

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#85:1:A>
But I  ' m weak in Mandarin

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X86:1:Z>
You weak in Mandarin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#87:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#88:1:A>
Because you know it  ' s difficult to for the for the tone I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#89:1:A>
It  ' s difficult to get the sense of the tones of Mandarin

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X90:1:Z>
Yeah <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X91:1:Z>
How old is the tutor the the students you  ' re tutoring </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#92:1:A>
Uhm she she  ' s just uh twelve years old

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X93:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#94:1:A>
Very young

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X95:1:Z>
And she does she enjoy school or how does she find school </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#96:1:A>
Uh she enjoys going to school

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#97:1:A>
<{> <[> Because </[> she has a lot of friends there

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#98:1:A>
She often tells me <,> uhm how the school is going on

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#99:1:A>
And uh she will <?> introduces </?> her friends to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#100:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X101:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X102:1:Z>
Oh that sounds very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X103:1:Z>
What about uh <,> <.> si </.> like

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X104:1:Z>
What kind of grades does she get </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#105:1:A>
Above average

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#106:1:A>
Not the top one but you know quite well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X107:1:Z>
Oh that  ' s good

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X108:1:Z>
Does she find school uh to be a lot of pressure

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X109:1:Z>
I hear in Hong Kong the students <,> are under a great deal of
pressure from their parents <,> to get good grades </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#110:1:A>
I think <?> luckily </?> uhm her parents uh do not give her
so much pressure

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#111:1:A>
Because uhm they think uh <.> th </.> she should

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#112:1:A>
It  ' s better for her to study by her own self and to enjoy
studying

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#113:1:A>
So that  ' s better but I know for other parents it  ' s not the case

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#114:1:A>
They often think children should uhm work hard and to get higher
marks in order to get <,> into a good school

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X115:1:Z>
So do they pressure their children quite a bit </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#116:1:A>
Yes because of the competition in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#117:1:A>
You know they have to complete with each other in order to get in
into a better school

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#118:1:A>
So I think because of the competition

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#119:1:A>
So they have to work hard in order to get higher marks

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X120:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X121:1:Z>
Well <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X122:1:Z>
What do you think about all of this

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X123:1:Z>
You think it  ' s a good system

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X124:1:Z>
Does Hong Kong have a good educational system <,> or does it need
some changes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#125:1:A>
I think it needs some <,> changes as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#126:1:A>
So because you know the education system here makes children feel
very <,> very afraid of their studies

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X127:1:Z>
Afraid of failure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#128:1:A>
Yeah afraid of failure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X129:1:Z>
What will they do if they feel like they fail </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#130:1:A>
Maybe suicide

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X131:1:Z>
Suicide </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#132:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#133:1:A>
Have you heard about it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X134:1:Z>
Uhm yeah I  ' ve heard that happens on occasion

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X135:1:Z>
Is it a real problem in Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#136:1:A>
Yes it  ' s a real problem I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#137:1:A>
Especially for those uhm lower form students like uhm thirteen or
fourteen years old students

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X138:1:Z>
Really there  ' s students that young committing suicide </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#139:1:A>
Because they think it  ' s a way for them to escape from <,>
from the problem

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#140:1:Z>
From the pressure of <{> <[> school </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#141:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#142:1:A>
They think it  ' s a way for them to escape <,> from the reality

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#143:1:A>
So you know it  ' s <,> it  ' s not a good phenomenon in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X144:1:Z>
Oh that  ' s a bad phenomenon </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#145:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#146:1:A>
How about in Canada

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X147:1:Z>
Uh I don't think there  ' s <,> that kind of problems is much

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X148:1:Z>
Uhm school is difficult and their pressure does exist put on
students from their parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X149:1:Z>
But I think it  ' s a little more <unc> one-word </unc>
healthy environment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#150:1:A>
Uhm <,,> uh is it because you know the competition is not as
serious as in Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X151:1:Z>
Well the competition is quite serious there also

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X152:1:Z>
Uh it  ' s difficult to get into university

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X153:1:Z>
But I don't think anybody will commit suicide or <,> see that as
a proper way of <,> of getting out of <,> out of the problems

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X154:1:Z>
So <,> I don't know it  ' s the competition as a problem in Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X155:1:Z>
Or it  ' s the pressure put on <,> the kids by their parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X156:1:Z>
Or what I will need to look into a little more and ask some more
questions </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#157:1:A>
Actually I think uhm the problem is not <,> just from the
parents

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#158:1:A>
Because schools often <,> you know teach children uhm from the
textbook

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#159:1:A>
They think they should remember what the teachers <,> told them

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#160:1:A>
So I think schools should be responsible for that problem too

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#161:1:A>
Because of the education system

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#162:1:A>
And I think uhm it  ' s time for them to have a change

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X163:1:Z>
Yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#164:1:A>
<[> Actually </[> </{> I worked a <,> a paper <,> uhm
proposing to change the existing education system

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#165:1:A>
And to evaluate the the exist existing system as well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X166:1:Z>
Yeah that sounds very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X167:1:Z>
Tell me Olive

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X168:1:Z>
When you are a little girl and when you are growing up in <,>
this Hong Kong educational system

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X169:1:Z>
Did you feel a great deal of pressure on yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#170:1:A>
Yes actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#171:1:A>
Especially when I <,> uhm when it  ' s time for me to enter into the
secondary school

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#172:1:A>
I have to get high marks in order to

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#173:1:A>
You know in order to get into a good school

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#174:1:A>
I have to uhm <,> to join <,> the public examination as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#175:1:A>
It  ' s it  ' s not you know I  ' m afraid of it a lot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X176:1:Z>
Uh <,> so did you said you study very very hard </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#177:1:A>
Yes I have to study <,,> a <,> a bit because <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#178:1:A>
Actually it  ' s not testing my English or Chinese or or <,>
Mathematics as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#179:1:A>
It <,> tests students uhm just like an aptitude test <,> aptitude
test

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#180:1:A>
So they have to get higher marks

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#181:1:A>
They test their logic <,> such kind of things

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#182:1:A>
So we had to practise a lot before we enter the examination

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X183:1:Z>
Uhm <,,> <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X184:1:Z>
Well did you get a chance to play some sports when you  ' re
growing up <?> too </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X185:1:Z>
Or have hobbies or go out with your friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#X186:1:Z>
You didn't have to study all the time </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-018#187:1:A>
Uhm actually I don't like sport

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#188:1:A>
I don't like sports

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#189:1:A>
I like maybe badminton but I do not play it well

<ICE-HK:S1A-018#190:1:A>
So I don't like sport

<$Z> <X>
