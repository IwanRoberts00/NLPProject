Legco has approved a two point seven billion dollar funding for
part of the construction of the number nine container terminal on Southeast
Tsang Yi

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#2:1:A>
That  ' s despite strong protests from the area  ' s residents

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#3:1:A>
Peri Chow has that story

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#4:1:B>
Legislatives were told that any developer who gets the building
contract for the new terminal will bear most of the costs but the Government
will have to pay two point seven billion dollars for building a backup area
and some infrastructures

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#5:1:B>
Some legislators saw the plan as a big disruption to the life of the
residents there <O> voice of translator of Lee Wing Tat Legco member  ' s
speech </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#6:1:B>
But officials stressed that Hong Kong will suffer economically if
the first berth of the new terminal isn't ready by mid nineteen ninety-five

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#7:1:B>
That explained why the funding request must be passed before Legco
recesses in the summer

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#8:1:B>
But today  ' s decision doesn't mean residents  '  concern won't be
taken into account <O> translator  ' s voice of Legco member Bowen Leung  ' s
speech </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#9:1:B>
Some twenty residents from Tsang Yi voiced their opposition to the
funding by petitioning outside Legco

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#10:1:B>
They complained that their life will be seriously disturbed by an
increase in air noise and traffic pollution and they wanted the Government to
put the project on hold

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#11:1:B>
But it seems their hopes have been dashed at least for the time
being

In a watershed decision today the CRC aims to try and form a
new political party

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#X44:2:Z>
In the long term interest of Hong Kong there is the need for a
broadly based political party that represents liberal pragmatic views </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#45:2:A>
Member Moses Cheng will head a steering committee to draft a
proposal by next month on the philosophical operational and financial aspects
of such a party

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#46:2:A>
This draft would form the basis of discussions with other
interested groups

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#47:2:A>
Members say the party if formed would transform the CRC as it is
known today a conservative group of twenty appointed and indirectly elected
legislators

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#X48:2:Z>
We well be the catalyst in the formation of a political party

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#X49:2:Z>
It doesn't it doesn't mean that CRC <?> would </?> be changed into
a political party </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#50:2:A>
The group reportedly spent much of the day soul searching in
the wake of what many perceived to be a deteriorating public image

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#51:2:B>
Our contact uhm with uhm the man on the street uhm

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#52:2:B>
For most of us it  ' s mainly come through the OMELCO complaint
system

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#53:2:B>
I I personally don't think that is sufficient

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#54:2:B>
I I believe we will need to have more contact uhm with people
living in uhm sort of all districts in in Hong Kong now

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#55:2:B>
That of course is an intention

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#56:2:A>
It didn't help the CRC to have another of its members drop out

Kong Bank bowed out saying the CRC needs a single voice in Legco and he could
not toe the line on everything all of the time

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#58:2:A>
Cheng had abstained from voting in a recent crucial motion debate
on the electoral system

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#59:2:C>
Many dissenting view on public issues within the CRC would
throw doubts on CRC  ' s public stance and undermine CRC  ' s position

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#60:2:C>
Uh it is for this reason and this reason alone that I I  ' ve decided
to leave because I cannot guarantee that sort of commitment

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#61:2:A>
Cheng believed unity is crucial for the CRC because it has all
along been perceived as a political party and to be the Conservative Party
representing the establishment and with a clear pro-government policy stance

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#62:2:A>
Meanwhile the United Democrat Yeung Sum has welcomed news of the
CRC trying to form a new political party

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#63:2:D>
It  ' s a natural development as the Hong Kong becoming more
politicized and more democratized

<ICE-HK:S2B-016#64:2:D>
And we need more people get organized to participate in the
politics

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-016#65:2:A>
Any changes to the CRC promises to further politicize the
new-style Legco

Severe tropical storm Gary didn't do much damage to the
