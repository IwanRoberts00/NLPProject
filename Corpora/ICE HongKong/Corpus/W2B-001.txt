<ICE-HK:W2B-001#2:1>
<bold> Clifton Ko is one of Hong Kong  ' s great theatrical showmen but
can he create a local Broadway ? <it> Desiree Au </it> reports </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#3:1>
<bold> TWO DAYS BEFORE </bold> the premiere of Springtime
Production  ' s latest show , <it> Jubilee </it> , and things are not falling
into place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#4:1>
&ldquo; Is Hong Kong going backwards ? &rdquo; Clifton Ko , head of
Springtime Production asks after putting down the receiver .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#5:1>
&ldquo; People really need to be more flexible , instead of being so
stiff and bureaucratic . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#6:1>
The problem is to do with Ko trying to set up an on-site box
office selling tickets for Springtime  ' s upcoming shows .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#7:1>
It had to be scrapped because the Jockey Club Auditorium at the
Polytechnic University , where <it> Jubilee </it> is playing , uses a
different ticketing system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#8:1>
&ldquo; We are using the Ticketek system because it carries a lower
commission than the government-owned Urbtix system , &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#9:1>
Urbtix charges &dollar;9 in commission for each ticket and Ticketek
charges only &dollar;5 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#10:1>
&ldquo; But now I guess we will just have to have people there ,
manually issuing tickets because they can't spare a few telephone lines ,
&rdquo; he adds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#11:1>
In the world of commercial theatre , the bottom line is as
important as the actors ' line .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#12:1>
These days , Ko sounds more like the financial controller than the
theatre producer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#13:1>
His business card reads Chief Executive Officer , an appropriate
title because Springtime Production - which he formed with long-time partner
, director and playwright Raymond To Kwok-wai - has grossed more than
&dollar;100 million from 15 productions over the past five years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#14:1>
<it> Jubilee </it> , an old Shanghai-style musical , is the first
Springtime show to be held at the new PolyU venue which will save the company
at least 30 per cent in rental . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#15:1>
&ldquo; You can say I am number sensitive , but it  ' s a business
, &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#16:1>
This will be the only way for all theatre groups in Hong Kong to
succeed , if Ko has his way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#17:1>
&ldquo; Theatre should be a free market , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#18:1>
&ldquo; That way , theatre companies are accountable for what they do .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#19:1>
He is all for ending subsidised theatre , a move , he thinks , is
better in the long run for everyone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#20:1>
&ldquo; This system can't continue , it  ' s not fair that some
theatre groups don't have to worry about revenue while some of us have to
shoulder the financial risk , &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#21:1>
If Ko sounds like he has a chip on his shoulder , e does .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#22:1>
He has grand plans for Springtime , hoping the company will do for
Hong Kong what Andrew Lloyd Webber did for the West End and Broadway . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#23:1>
In January , Springtime  ' s production of <it> Butterflies Are
Free </it> &obrack;  produced in 1999 &cbrack; completed a 22-show run in Shanghai , playing
to packed houses every night .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#24:1>
This month , springtime will resume their tour in Beijing , Sichuan ,
Shenzhen and Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#25:1>
Ko wants to sell video and television rights as well as film rights
for his productions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#26:1>
In short , he wants Springtime to become an international brand name .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#27:1>
&ldquo; Who doesn't want Hong Kong to have its own Broadway ,
&rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#28:1>
&ldquo; People pay good money to see <it> Les Miserables </it> and
<it> Phantom of the Opera </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#29:1>
They also pay good money to see us because we give them a quality
time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#30:1>
I want Chinese people to have something they can identify as their
own , something they can be proud of . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#31:1>
The shows are performed in Cantonese when played in Hong Kong and
are translated into Putonghua for tours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#32:1>
Ko makes no qualms about having a business mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#33:1>
He feels that as a producer , part of his job is to ensure that the
company stays in business . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#34:1>
&ldquo; The first thing I have to do is to control the budget ,
&rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#35:1>
&ldquo; I have to guarantee the company profit , even if it  ' s only a
dollar . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#36:1>
With the average play costing a minimum of &dollar;10 million for
springtime , the pressure is often hard to bear .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#37:1>
&ldquo; If we lose money , it  ' s no one  ' s fault but my own , &rdquo;
Ko says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#38:1>
Has there been a need to trade artistic value for sales revenue ?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#39:1>
&ldquo; Why can't artists make money ? &rdquo; Ko asks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#40:1>
&ldquo; There is really no conflict between art and money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#41:1>
I am there to produce a show with artistic acclaim .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#42:1>
I am also there to produce a box office success . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#43:1>
In a fickle town like Hong Kong , having both worlds isn't easy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#44:1>
According to Ko , part of Springtime  ' s success has to do with
knowing where to focus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#45:1>
&ldquo; We focus strictly on the audiences and deliver what they want .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#46:1>
It doesn't matter if you make a great  ' artistic ' play if only 10
people come to see it , &rdquo; he says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#47:1>
It  ' s not that Ko hasn't tried .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#48:1>
In 1998 , Springtime produced a play called <it> Love Paradox </it> ,
based on a famous Chinese opera, <it> The Lovers </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#49:1>
It told the bitter-sweet tale of a pair of ill-fated young lovers who
were victims of strict archaic Chinese values .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#50:1>
Ko put in a twist , giving the play some homosexual overtones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#51:1>
&ldquo; I thought I doing something artistic and many theatre critics
expressed great interest in the play , &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#52:1>
But the play turned out to be a flop and Springtime lost &dollar;2
million dollars .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#53:1>
&ldquo; It failed because no one wanted to pay money to see the play
, so it doesn't matter when we say something is artistic or commercial , if
it doesn't survive the box office , it doesn't exist . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#54:1>
&ldquo; The so-called high art only exists in proposals , &rdquo;
he says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#55:1>
Ko credits his company partner , To , for keeping the audiences
happy .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#56:1>
" Raymond is the perfect combination of artistic and commercial sense
, &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#57:1>
&ldquo; He can lead the audience without losing them , gives them
something refreshing to see without making our shows too out of reach .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#58:1>
Hence his strong objection to subsidised theatres . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#59:1>
&ldquo; In the long run it just won't work , it  ' s welfare for
the artists , &rdquo; Ko says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#60:1>
&ldquo; Some of these so called  ' independent ' or  ' avant-garde'
theatre groups are merely using tax dollars to fulfil themselves , they don't
have to worry about cost because it  ' s the Government  ' s money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#61:1>
They have no responsibility to the audience . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#62:1>
Others beg to differ .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#63:1>
Renowned playwright Ko Tin-lung , who helped Clifton Ko produce the
musical <it> I Have A Date With Spring </it> that helped kick-start
Springtime  ' s success , claims subsidised theatre is the core of theatrical
development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#64:1>
Commercial theatre companies are not going to experiments with
new ideas or plays because it is too risky , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#65:1>
&ldquo; Subsidised theatre opens up new ground .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#66:1>
It doesn't mean we don't have a responsibility to our audiences , we
also want people to see our plays . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#67:1>
Ko Tin-lung has decided to join Chung Ying Theatre Group instead
of staying with Springtime , precisely because he believes in subsidised
theatres .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#68:1>
&ldquo; Chung Ying needs me , I want to be there or explore , or else
we will die in public taste , &rdquo; he says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#69:1>
In springtime  ' s past 15 productions , Clifton Ko has tested
different formulas and says he is now much better at sizing up market tastes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#70:1>
&ldquo; We did adaptations , comedies and musicals , but I think
people are looking for that special chemistry , &rdquo; he says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#71:1>
The chemistry comes from casting the right people in the right
roles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#72:1>
&ldquo; I am not selling celebrities in my show , &rdquo; Clifton Ko
says , although he did cast the 60s screen goddess Chan Po-chu in 1997's <it>
Sentimental Journey </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#73:1>
&ldquo; I chose her because she had great stage experience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#74:1>
And it just so happens that she has legions of fans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#75:1>
It doesn't mean I am going to cast Nicholas Tse just because he is
popular with young girls . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#76:1>
It will be a challenge for Springtime to stay on top .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#77:1>
Many entertainment companies are catching the wave .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#78:1>
The Emperor Entertainment Group and TVB have both staged successful
shows of their own and are advertising new ones with stars like Tony Leung
Kar-fai , Dodo Cheung Yu-ling and Carina Lau Ka-ling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#79:1>
&ldquo; Competition is good , it pushes me , &rdquo; Clifton Ko
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#80:1>
He is quick to add that springtime still holds the record of 150
consecutive regional shows with the play <it> Butterflies Are Free </it> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#81:1>
All this and Clifton Ko says he almost gave up everything for a
quiet life in Hawaii .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#82:1>
&ldquo; I was all packed up and ready to go in 1995 , &rdquo; Clifton
Jo , 43 , says from his office that overlooks a grey street in the grimy
commercial district of Kwun Tong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#83:1>
He was 38 then , had made several successful films but the industry
was beginning to falter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#84:1>
He wanted to retire early and watch his two daughters grow up .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#85:1>
He even bought a home in Honolulu .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#86:1>
Then he saw a play produced by the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre called
<it> I Have A Date With Spring </it> , which starred several unknown actors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#87:1>
&ldquo; If it wasn't for <it> Spring </it> , I think I would be lying
on the beach getting fat . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#88:1>
He made the play into a film , which become a surprise hit , and
then made the bold move of bringing <it> Spring </it> back to the stage for a
staggering 70-show run .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#89:1>
What began as a part-time project has come a long way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#90:1>
&ldquo; I just don't want to see Hong Kong being invaded by Disney
and the Really Useful Company , &rdquo; he says . </p>

</I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#91:2>
<bold> Outstanding conduct </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#92:2>
<bold> Three Tenors ' conductor Janos Acs is the hard-working , unsung
hero of one of the greatest shows on Earth , but you won't hear him complain
, as <it> Desiree Au </it> reports </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#93:2>
<bold> CONDUCTOR JANOS ACS </bold> apparently isn't in the best
of moods . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#94:2>
It has been a taxing week for the Hungarian Acs , who will be
conducting The Three Tenors concerts at Beijing  ' s Forbidden City tomorrow
and Pavarotti  ' s solo concert in Hong Kong next Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#95:2>
With Pavarotti  ' s sudden decision to postpone his Hong Kong
engagement to be with his promoter , Tibor Rudas , who is suffering an ear
infection , Acs found himself having to frantically re-arrange rehearsals
between the two cities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#96:2>
But images of a grumpy conductor quickly gave way to a kinder ,
gentler man when Acs , 49 , sits down for the interview . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#97:2>
&ldquo; I though it would be impossible , but in the end it
turned out OK because we are just travelling within Asia , &rdquo; Acs says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#98:2>
&ldquo; I need at least six rehearsals before a concert , and I am
told the Hong Kong Sinfonietta will only allow rehearsals up to three hours
per day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#99:2>
There is a lot of work to do in a very short time . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#100:2>
Is he upset with Pavarotti ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#101:2>
&ldquo; No , I actually see it as the sign of a great musician , his
voice is so dependent on his psychological well-being , &rdquo; Acs says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#102:2>
&ldquo; In 10 years of working with him , this is the second time he
has cancelled a concert .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#103:2>
Rudas is probably one of the most important people in his life and I  ' m
absolutely sticking with Luciano .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#104:2>
He  ' s a good man and takes his engagements very seriously . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#105:2>
Like the demanding , fickle superstars he frequently works with
, Acs has a reputation for toughness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#106:2>
With less than a week to prepare the Hong Kong Sinfonietta and the
Symphony Orchestra of the national Opera of China , the latter of which will
be watched live by an estimated two billion people on television , Acs is
running a boot camp for musicians . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#107:2>
&ldquo; I have a difficult job , &rdquo; he admits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#108:2>
&ldquo; I have to put in a lot of energy , especially in the
beginning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#109:2>
Most orchestras have never played operas before , and the tempo
changes very quickly , something they  ' re not used to with classical
repertoires .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#110:2>
You have to make that clear to 70 people . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#111:2>
It  ' s not all work and no play .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#112:2>
Acs entered the rehearsal room to find the folk from the Peak  ' s
Madame Tussard  ' s wax museum had placed the wax figure of Luciano Pavarotti
smack in the middle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#113:2>
He broke into laughter and went and hugged the form of his dear
friend and colleague . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#114:2>
Like his contemporaries Zubin Mehta and James Levine , Acs has
the privilege of being associated with the biggest and most profitable names
in classical music , the Three Tenors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#115:2>
He is particularly close to Pavarotti , having been the tenor  ' s
personal pianist for 10 years and conducted his solo concerts in Amsterdam ,
Venezuela and his hometown , Budapest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#116:2>
Acs met Pavarotti , 66 , 10 years ago when the tenor popped in
to a rehearsal at a talent agency run by Pavarotti  ' s ex-wife , Adua Veroni ,
found Acs accompanying a youthful tenor in a piece by Mascagni .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#117:2>
&ldquo; He was so surprised that a Hungarian can have such great
feelings for music written by Italians he invited me to go to his home in
Italy , &rdquo; Acs recalls . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#118:2>
&ldquo; We got along great , and Pavarotti asked me to conduct
his concert in Budapest in 1991 . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#119:2>
But even before that meeting , Acs was one of opera  ' s most
sought-after conductors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#120:2>
At age seven he joined the choir of the Budapest State Opera , a
200-year-old institution that counts Gustav Mahler among its musical
directors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#121:2>
Acs has lived in Italy for 25 years and got his first break as a
repetiteur at La Scala in Milan and Teatro Comunale in Florence , where he
accompanied singers such as Katia Ricciarelli and Mariella Davis , before
taking artistic directorships at opera house in Pretoria , South Africa , and
Colorado in the US . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#122:2>
But it is his work with the Three Tenors that Acs finds the most
intensive and rewarding .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#123:2>
What is it like to be so close to them ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#124:2>
&ldquo; They are just amazing people , with a gift of voice , a
sense of concentration and such strong responsibility .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#125:2>
To be number one , it takes the coordination of one  ' s emotions ,
talents and mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#126:2>
Once you hear them sing , it  ' s something you never forget . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#127:2>
&ldquo; When things are going right they are pretty relaxed and
happy , but moments before each show they each retreat to their own dressing
room , &rdquo; he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#128:2>
&ldquo; I think what happens at that time is between them and God .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-001#129:2>
But he doesn't only see his future with the Three Tenors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#130:2>
&ldquo; The money is good , but I want something else , &rdquo; he
muses .

<ICE-HK:W2B-001#131:2>
&ldquo; I want to be the artistic director of La Scala . &rdquo;
