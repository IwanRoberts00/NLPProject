Dear Mr . <O> deleted </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#141:11>
In response to your letter dated 17 October , which arrived at
our office on 28 October , I am very sorry to hear that you have been having
so much trouble with your Atlanta chess computer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#142:11>
The Atlanta is quite a rugged model and since we first started
shipping this product in 1997 , we have not received any reports of such a
fault .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#143:11>
In addition our quality assurance department checked our
manufacturing on-line testing records and could not find any related
incidences . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#144:11>
Often times these isolated cases are due to a faulty component .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#145:11>
That is why <O> deleted </O> recommends our customers to send
faulty products back to the service centres .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#146:11>
Although your product is no longer under warranty , we would be
very happy to repair this at no cost to you as this will allow us to
investigate the exact cause of the failure and assure this does not occur
again in any future productions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#147:11>
Please send your Atlanta , securely packed , preferably in its
original box , by FedEx and charged to our account 3000-1876-9 , to:

Dear Mr . <O> deleted </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#165:13>
We received your Atlanta on 29 November and have subjected it
to continuous testing since then .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#166:13>
It was only 3 days ago that we found the problem you encountered .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#167:13>
So far our engineers have not been able to locate the cause of this
problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#168:13>
However , as you have been more than patient with us and we do
not know how long it will take to find and cure this problem , we are sending
you a new replacement unit of the Atlanta .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#169:13>
We would also like to offer you a travel chess computer , the Miami
, so that you can play chess wherever you go .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#170:13>
While it is not as strong as the Atlanta , it is still a very
enjoyable unit at around 1800 Swedish <foreign> Elos </foreign> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#171:13>
The Miami has been our best selling travel units in Europe this
past year , and I do not believe it is widely distributed yet in the United
States . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#172:13>
Thank you for your patience , and I do hope these <O> deleted
</O> products do not let you down . </p>

<p>

Thank you for your kind letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#184:15>
At <O> deleted </O> we do try and make a point of ensuring customer
satisfaction to the best of our abilities .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#185:15>
It is always a bit distressing to receive complaints or hear of
problems with our products , but these are useful as they help us avoid the
same mistakes in the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#186:15>
Over the past few years our focus on chess computers has been
on the beginner level machines , as this is where the big market lies .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#187:15>
With PCs becoming more and more powerful , most expert level
players have migrated to the various chess software packages .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#188:15>
It is just not possible to make an affordable stand alone chess
computer with the processing speed and power of a PC based system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#189:15>
With regards to <foreign> Elos </foreign> , it is always a bit
difficult to offer a standard rating .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#190:15>
Depending on the type of game played , e.g . Blitz , Tournament ,
fun etc . the rating would be different .

<ICE-HK:W1B-030#191:15>
Moreover , while it is generally recognized that USCF is about 200
points higher than Swedish <foreign> Elos </foreign> , there can sometimes be
slight discrepancies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-030#192:15>
Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further
assistance to you . </p>
