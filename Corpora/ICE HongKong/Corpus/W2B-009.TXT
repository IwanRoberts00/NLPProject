<O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>
<h> <bold> The ice queen of <indig> Canto </indig> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#2:1>
<h> <bold> Faye Wong was known for her scalding temper as much as her
singing but now she  ' s cool , collected and very much in control .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#3:1>
Don't believe the hype , she tells <it> Vivienne Chow </it> </bold>
</h>

<p> <bold>  ' THE TRUTH </bold> doesn't matter any more, ' intones a calm and
collected Faye Wong , when she is asked whether her relationship with <indig>
Cantopop </indig> star Nicholas Tse Ting-fung is on the rocks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#4:1>
She leans purposefully back in her comfy chair , snaps a bite out of a
square of French toast and summons her assistant for another packet of Mild
Seven cigarettes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#5:1>
It isn't so easy to rile Faye Wong any more . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#6:1>

<p> Three years ago , it would scarcely have been noteworthy had the pop diva
launched herself at me across the table and jammed the toast into my eye .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#7:1>
At a press conference at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in
1999 , Wong lost her temper when an inquisitive journalist from Singapore
submitted a question about her divorce from Beijing rock star Dou Wei .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#8:1>
She screamed at the reporter , told her it was no one  ' s business but
her own and stormed out in the kind of dramatic huff only stars seem able to
carry off . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#9:1>

<p> All I get is a cheerful , perhaps defiant smile and a puff of cigarette
smoke .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#10:1>
Wong appears only too happy to consider the question , despite the
over-anxious butt-in from another assistant , who says:  ' Would you please
cancel that question! ' - intent on smothering the 32-year-old singer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#11:1>
Quite obviously , however , she can take care of herself . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#12:1>

<p>  ' I  ' ve already answered it, ' Wong cuts in .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#13:1>
Well , actually , she hasn't .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#14:1>
What she has said is this:  ' The main function of the entertainment
press is to get stories that are entertaining but sometimes the truth may not
be as juicy as you imagine .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#15:1>
Even if I answer the questions honestly , they still make up stories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#16:1>
They have their own ideas on how my private life should be .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#17:1>
I have no desire to change that image so I choose not to answer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#18:1>
In this way they can continue to write whatever they want to. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#19:1>

<p> So she  ' s answered by questioning the question  ' s validity - that old
celebrity trick - but at least that toast is staying on her side of the table .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#20:1>
'Sometimes the entertainment news about me covers details I have
never heard before,' ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#21:1>
'I quite enjoy reading the stories myself .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#22:1>
I  ' m just so fascinated by this .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#23:1>
But I  ' m not keen to tell people who I am or explain to people what I
have or haven't done .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#24:1>
Now I don't really mind what has been written about me. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#25:1>

<p> That  ' s about as close an answer as anyone  ' s likely to get from Wong on
the state of her relationship with Tse , who is 11 years her junior .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#26:1>
Not that you can really blame her .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#27:1>
Since the couple walked out of a private function , hand in hand ,
two years ago , they have been pursued relentlessly by the paparazzi . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#28:1>

<p> And that  ' s hardly surprising , given Wong is the undisputed queen of
<indig> Cantopop </indig> and Tse , a <indig> Cantopop </indig> star himself
, is also the son of 1960s heart-throb actor Patrick Tse Yin and actress
Deborah Lai .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#29:1>
That was more than enough star quality to send even the most haggard
entertainment hack into a frenzy when the couple  ' s romance was first
revealed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#30:1>
Now there are rumours of a parting of ways , the gossip machine is
again moving into overdrive . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#31:1>

<p> But Wong has learned to be philosophical following the often fanatical
media interest surrounding her marriage to Dou in 1996 and divorce three
years later .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#32:1>
'I  ' m more open-minded now, ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#33:1>
'At the beginning , I got upset quite often by the way I was
portrayed in the newspapers and how people saw me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#34:1>
But since I can't ask the entire world to change for me , I now look
at these matters in a positive way. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#35:1>

<p> Until , that is , her five-year-old daughter by Dou , Ching-tung , is
added to the mix .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#36:1>
Ching-tung has been the subject of cut-throat press clamour since
even before she was born .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#37:1>
The battle to publish the first photograph of Wong pregnant resulted
in a court case between rival newspapers Oriental Sunday and Apple Daily .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#38:1>
The Oriental Sunday snapped the slightly swelling singer in the
baggage lounge of Beijing Airport in October 1996 - the first confirmation
that the star was expecting - and took Apple to court after it printed a
spoiler story on the front page , including the picture , on the same day .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#39:1>

<p> Since then , even the little girl has had to run the press gauntlet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#40:1>
On February 1 , Chinese-language entertainment magazine Sudden Weekly
published photographs of Ching-tung at the Hong Kong International School and
ran an interview allegedly conducted with her on her way to the school in
Repulse Bay .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#41:1>
The interview claimed the youngster said Tse hadn't visited her
mother for some time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#42:1>
Wong was understandably furious .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#43:1>
And for a moment , as she recounts the episode to me , the expression
that darkens her face would , I know , have been terrifyingly familiar to the
unfortunate reporter at the press conference three years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#44:1>
Wong leans forward .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#45:1>
She  ' s more serious now .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#46:1>
The interview never took place , she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#47:1>
'I checked with my maid and spoke to my daughter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#48:1>
She has never done this kind of interview before .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#49:1>
Sure , she might have said hello to someone but there couldn't have
been enough time for her to tell a reporter so many details . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#50:1>

<p>  ' I understand people want to read about her and she cannot escape from
being harassed because she is my daughter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#51:1>
It is not harmful if they make up stories about me but she is only a
five-year-old child .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#52:1>
Can't the public sacrifice a little bit of their curiosity so the
child can grow up in a healthy environment ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#53:1>
Can't they at least just wait till she  ' s older? ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#54:1>

<p> Up close , it  ' s easy to see why Wong  ' s face graces so many magazine
covers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#55:1>
She has beautiful , big round eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#56:1>
She says her tall and slender figure requires little maintenance ,
even after she gave birth to Ching-tung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#57:1>
And Wong is a trend-setter .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#58:1>
What she wears will often become the hottest fashion items of the
season - even though she seems to be the only person able to carry off what
are often quirky designs . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#59:1>

<p> Born in 1969 , Wong moved to Hong Kong with her family from Beijing at
the end of 1987 when she was 18 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#60:1>
Her enthusiasm for singing led her to the respected voice coach Tai
Sze-chung and , at just 20 , she was recommended by Tai to Cinepoly , with
which she secured a record deal . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#61:1>

<p> In 1989 , Wong released her debut album , <it> Shirley Wong Ching-man
</it> , a stage name she then used , which won her Commercial Radio  ' s
Ultimate Female Newcomer &obrack;  Bronze &cbrack; award .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#62:1>
In 1991 , she left for the United States to study music .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#63:1>
When she returned the next year , she released the album <it> Coming
Home </it> , which became her first platinum record .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#64:1>
She retrieved her real name , Wong Fei-Faye Wong - in 1994 and has
so far made 22 studio albums . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#65:1>

<p> In 1997 , Wong announced she would make no more Cantonese albums when she
left Cinepoly for global giant EMI .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#66:1>
But she does sing the occasional Cantonese song in addition to the
records in Putonghua .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#67:1>
'It is a marketing decision, ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#68:1>
'To sing well , one has to master the language in order to deliver
the best sound .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#69:1>
<h> <bold>  '  I got upset quite often by the way I was portrayed in
the newspapers and how people saw me , but since I can't ask the entire world
to change for me , I now look at these matters in a positive way ' </bold>
Faye Wong </h> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#70:1>
Putonghua is my native tongue so naturally I  ' m more confident with
this language .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#71:1>
But records are considered a commodity and we must take sales into
account. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#72:1>

<p> Wong  ' s singing and songwriting talents , if widely recognised , are
often tagged under the  ' alternative ' label , although she has been voted best
female singer on numerous occasions in Hong Kong , the mainland and Southeast
Asia , and took the best alternative song composition trophy last year at the
CASH Golden Sail Awards in the SAR with <it> Han Wu Jie </it> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#73:1>

<p> This kind of success usually brings a measure of satisfaction , so how
does Wong still find herself singing songs she doesn't particularly like ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#74:1>
'I enjoy performing my own compositions but my taste in music is too
off-mainstream and only a few people appreciate that, ' says Wong , who has
covered songs by Tori Amos and collaborated with the Cocteau Twins .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#75:1>
'I know what the masses like and I know they skip my compositions and
listen to the commercial tracks .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#76:1>
Hong Kong is not like Japan , where it accommodates various musical
styles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#77:1>
I have too many business partners and I must consider their interests
as well .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#78:1>
I  ' m more mature now and I strike a balance between my personal
interests and commercial value. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#79:1>

<p> Thus , she is promoting her new film .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#80:1>
It is the Lunar New Year crowd-drawer <it> Chinese Odyssey 2002 </it>
, her fourth film , in which she plays opposite Tony Leung Chiu-wai .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#81:1>
It is also a testament to her new , more-mellow attitude .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#82:1>
When she last played opposite Leung in <it> Chungking Express </it>
in 1994 , Wong barely spoke to her co-star .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#83:1>
This time , in a hectic two-month shoot over Christmas , she says the
pair got on well .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#84:1>
Leung told the <it> South China Morning Post </it> she  ' seemed like a
different person this time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#85:1>
She is very cheerful and friendly. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#86:1>

<p> Wong plays the role of Princess Wu Shuang , who escapes from her palace
for fun , often disguising herself as a man , only for both a man and a woman
to fall for her .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#87:1>
'Filming <it> Chungking Express </it> was painful for me because I
had no idea what I was doing at all, ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#88:1>
'But <it> Chinese Odyssey 2002 </it> was an enjoyable experience -
though I didn't have time to sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#89:1>
The team spirit was fantastic. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-009#90:1>
But it  ' s not just her character that changed between the two
movies , she insists .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#91:1>
Wong Kar-wai , the director of <it> Chungking Express </it> , and
Jeff Lau Chun-wai , who wrote and directed <it> Chinese Odyssey 2002 </it> ,
were two extremes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#92:1>
'As I am not confident and experienced with acting , I need
demonstrations on how to act, ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#93:1>
'Jeff gave me very clear direction: he is willing to teach , whereas
Wong Kar-wai did not want me to understand what was on his mind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#94:1>
I just had to perform what he told me to and some of the situations
were quite embarrassing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#95:1>
Sometimes I didn't have a clue what I was doing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#96:1>
It was good for me because there was no need for me to analyse the
character .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#97:1>
But now I want to know more about acting. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#98:1>

<p> In Wong  ' s 1994 song <it> Exit </it> , she describes herself as having a
lack of patience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#99:1>
That  ' s one thing that has not changed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#100:1>
After 30 minutes , a clutch of cigarettes and a snack attack of
toast , she gets up with an  ' Is that OK? ' and has exited left before even her
hovering assistants can pretend it was their idea. </p>

<h> <bold> Ancient bronze sex toy a stimulating piece of history
</bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#102:2>

<p> An ancient Chinese sex aid dating back to the Han Dynasty of 2,000 years
ago has gone on display alongside Xian  ' s terracotta warriors in a new
exhibition at the Hong Kong Museum of History . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#103:2>

<p> The phallic sex aid for women is made of bronze and is believed to have
been used by courtesans living in the imperial palace . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#104:2>

<p> The exhibition also includes a green glazed pottery model of a toilet ,
also from the Han Dynasty , complete with partition and ventilation window -
revealing an advanced society with privacy and sanitary concerns . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#105:2>

<p> Naomi Szeto , curator of the Hong Kong Museum of History , said combining
items from both the Qin and the Han dynasties &obrack;  which together span from
221BC to 220AD &cbrack; gives a fuller perspective of China  ' s unification . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#106:2>

<p> &ldquo; Most people know about emperor Qin and his fierce regime that
brought China together as a single nation by conquering six other states ,
&rdquo; she said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#107:2>
&ldquo; But we want to go one step further and present a picture of
what China was like after it achieved stability , by including relics when
the Han Dynasty ushered in an era of stability and a flourishing society .
&rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#108:2>

<p> Entitled &ldquo; War and Peace - Treasures of the Qin and Han Dynasties"
, the exhibition brings together one of the largest collections of terracotta
warriors from the Mausoleum of Qinshihuang &obrack;  246-210 BC &cbrack; and items from the
Mausoleum of Emperor Jing &obrack;  156-141 BC &cbrack; , with more than 100 exhibits from
Shaanxi province . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#109:2>

<p> The show is co-hosted by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and
the Chinese Cultural Artefacts Association as a contribution to the
forthcoming 2003 Hong Kong Arts Festival . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#110:2>

<p> The exhibition , which runs until March 17 , is divided into two parts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#111:2>
The " War &rdquo; section includes more than 10 Qinshihuang
terracotta soldiers displayed without glass cases &obrack;  more than 6,000 have been
unearthed since the 1970s &cbrack; , putting visitors merely an arm  ' s length away
from the artefacts. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#112:2>

<p> Qinshihuang , who is responsible for building the Great Wall of China ,
created such a massive underground terracotta empire - with his warriors
arranged in battle formation - it is believed less than 10 per cent has been
uncovered .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#113:2>
On show for the first time in Hong kong are civilian terracotta
figures , including an official , an acrobat and a servant . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#114:2>


<p> Many of the items on display in the &ldquo; Peace &rdquo; section are Han
Dynasty relics unearthed from Emperor Jing  ' s Mausoleum .

<ICE-HK:W2B-009#115:2>
Jing believed in reincarnation and in " treating the dead like the
living &rdquo; and he commissioned miniature pottery and bronze models of his
empire to be buried with him . </p>
