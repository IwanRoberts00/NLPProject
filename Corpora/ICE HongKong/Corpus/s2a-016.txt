<ICE-HK:S2A-016#1:1:A>
Well a very good evening welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s
Taipo racecourse <,> course Wednesday night racing this evening and we have
ten races on the sand surface <,> the going tonight is normal watering <,>
runners ah behind the barriers now for race number two the Moruya Handicap
class six gallopers over sixteen hundred metres the early favourite number
four Original <,> ahead of one Universe who  ' s met with a lot of support in
this second event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#2:1:A>
We will of course bring you a replay of race one that will come your
way in around fifteen to twenty minutes <,> and we only have one change for
tonight  ' s programme that comes in race five number one Natural Fortune has
been withdrawn and he  ' s replaced by the first standby Happy Stride <,> he  ' ll
jump from barrier four and Martin Chan takes that ride <,> C K Chan aboard
Happy Stride number one in race five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#3:1:A>
So runners behind the barriers the one and four is also favourite in
the Q at eight to one <,> and obviously we  ' ve got a bit of time up our
sleeves I  ' ll quickly go through the runners for this second event as we get
the blue light <,> one Universe

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#4:1:A>
so often close up he  ' s actually yet to fill a place in five runs on
the sand but most of those performances had actually been pretty good
including last start <,> while he finished fourth he was most unlucky not to
figure in the top three Victory Together  ' s not racing well for me <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#5:1:A>
Martini Star won well over the trip two starts back a little
disappointing last time <,> Original the favourite <,> always catches the eye
gets a mile back flashes home <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#6:1:A>
so the runs always look good but he is still a maiden on the sand
<,> and uh I would only like him for the second or third position due to his
run stall <,> just gets too far out of his ground while <,> the run obviously
was good last time

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#7:1:A>
he  ' s likely to do the same again tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#8:1:A>
Siu Yik will stay but mixes his form however has the services of
Danny Beasley <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#9:1:A>
Dragon Warrior goes forward number six I think

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#10:1:A>
it  ' s a big plus in the race and ah I can envisage him getting a
reasonable run up near the speed

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#11:1:A>
so I think he  ' s a chance of running a race here at odds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#12:1:A>
Explorer ran a little better last time but I I think he still needs
a little more time and under the odds at the moment at only nine to one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#13:1:A>
Asian Glory <,> won over fifteen hundred last time a fair run last
time but not out of the question to see him maybe grab a third position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#14:1:A>
Leun Yat Supreme recently trialled better but <,> still his two
runs this season have been poor and I don't think twelve to one is much spoil
<,> and Grand Nam Hoi a nine year old mare but ah she continues to finish
close up and she is an obvious chance for the minor end <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#15:1:A>
In this second event our commentator  ' s selections <,> Franko Lau
likes the way of four Original to defeat three Martini Star and five Siu Yik
<,> four three and five for Franko Lau <,> Harry Troy likes one five seven
and nine <,> Universe to defeat Siu Yik Explorer and Leun Yat Supreme <,> and
I did like the chances of Universe

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#16:1:A>
As I said he has been ah close up quite a few times on the on the
sand so there  ' s a zero from five record <,> I think he will be able to
improve that this evening and didn't have much luck last time <,> finished
fourth <,> should have been much much closer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#17:1:A>
So I thought he could win from five Siu Yik <,> ah I thought he was
open to improvement fresh up will stay Danny Beasley aboard and six Dragon
Warrior uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#18:1:A>
I think he will get a good run up near the lead to help his chances
out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#19:1:A>
I  ' ve gone one five six <,> I really do only like Original fill uh
fill a minor frame here because again <,> he will get a mile back <,> the run
pattern on the sand always against him and he just does catch the eye each
and every start and uh he  ' s just likely to do that again tonight <,> get
back storm and look like a good run <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#20:1:A>
I  ' m the captain Steve Mooney we  ' ll be joined later on by Franko
Lau but first of all it  ' s a very good evening to our race caller Harry Troy
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-016#21:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone they  ' re just
about set <,> Dragon Warrior about to go forward <,> flashing the favourite
number four Original <,> and just about set they  ' re off and running <,>
absolutely flying the gates was Dragon Warrior he lands in front from Asian
Glory Leun Yat Supreme away well tonight and going forward to be prominent in
that leading division as they run to the winning post for the first time is
Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#22:1:B>
crowded a bit deep Grand Nam Hoi

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#23:1:B>
now there  ' s a line of four on the back of him favourite Original
<,> over on the inside there in the white cap to his alongside of him I
should say Explorer followed then by Siu Yik Martini Star Victory Together
the tail ender <,> into the back they run <,> Dragon Warrior the pilot a
length and a half in advance of Asian Glory Universe gets to third

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#24:1:B>
travels okay <,> tacking on to the back of him but a bit deep then
is the mare Grand Nam Hoi followed then by the favourite Original

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#25:1:B>
he  ' s midfield the rail

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#26:1:B>
he  ' s just been shaded by Martini Star <,> in the centre splitting
them was uh then Explorer followed then by Siu Yik <,> second last was
Victory Together and Leun Yat Supreme is the tail ender and ten off the lead
<,> seven hundred metres out Dragon Warrior rolls along a half a length in
advance of Asian Glory

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#27:1:B>
he travels well <,> Universe travelling in third appears to be
travelling okay <,> favourite saves ground the rails

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#28:1:B>
Original not not too far away then Explorer Martini Star going
forward around the outside to get into the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#29:1:B>
On the back of them was Siu Yik he  ' s under a bit of pressure but
he is making ground <,> Grand Nam Hoi dropping off Victory Together and Leun
Yat Supreme the tail ender <,> on towards the corner and hard headed Dragon
Warrior about to be taken on by Asian Glory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#30:1:B>
Coming at them on the outside Universe starting to wind up with
Explorer and running on just fairly Siu Yik <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#31:1:B>
Asian Glory raced up and put the head in front of Dragon Warrior
they  ' re out by three to Explorer running on over on the inside Victory
Together and Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#32:1:B>
But Asian Glory got clear one hundred out <,> Asian Glory a length
and a half from Dragon Warrior running on late then Explorer and down the
outside Universe but Asian Glory too good <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#33:1:B>
Asian Glory four on the wire to Explorer Dragon Warrior runs third
close up then was Universe followed then by Victory Together <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#34:1:B>
Now let me see weakening away very quick then was Dragon Warrior
followed by Grand Nam Hoi Siu Yik favourite never really going Original <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#35:1:B>
And he  ' s ran back towards the tail of the field with Martini Star
and Leun Yat Supreme <,,> raced on the speed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#36:1:B>
And a little bit too good for them <,> got the upper hand here
inside the final one hundred metres and ah young James Chio back in the
saddle after a recent injury <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#37:1:B>
And it makes it two out of three for Asian Glory ass he gets nicely
clear of Dragon Warrior he weakened away very quickly Dragon Warrior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#38:1:B>
Explorer gets into second <,> and let  ' s have a look how they fair
for third but a big space winner <,> was <,> Asian Glory Explorer Dragon
Warrior just holding third from Victory Together and Universe <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#39:1:B>
So it  ' s eight seven six after the running of race number two eight
seven and six <,> and the winner number eight <,> Asian Glory James Chio for
Johnny Chan <,> seven year old brown New Zealand bred gelding and he  ' s by
Honour Grade from Eulogy Rose a Sangtang mare

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#40:1:B>
And uh he makes it two out of his last three <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#41:1:B>
Did have the best record of any runner at the distance was
disappointing last start but he was a winner two starts back and he seems to
go okay for this young boy James Chio <,> number seven is second Explorer

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#42:1:B>
Robbie Burke for Stephen Chow and he  ' s a five year old chestnut
New Zealand bred gelding Stark South Hi There <,> and officially third is
going to be number six Dragon Warrior

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#43:1:B>
He held on for third T K Nip and Tai Lam <,> out of Karma Cruise
from Kiakaha and the number one Universe Ricky Choi for Stephen Leung winding
up in fourth eight seven six and one <,> it  ' s four and a quarter by three
quarters he got away and won quite convincingly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#44:1:B>
Favourite <.> Or Or </.> Original he was disappointing and also
very well supported late was Universe <,> and he again was disappointing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#45:1:B>

Well welcome back live to Taipo racecourse Asian Glory wins
race number two for Johnny Chan and James Chio that  ' s his fifth winner this

Asian Glory

<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#55:1:A>
The quinella five hundred and fifty seven the tierce eleven
thousand three hundred and eighteen <,> four and a quarter by three quarters
the margins <,> one forty four point six the run time <,> as the <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#56:1:A>
it  ' s a very slow run time also even for class six so uh the track
might even be riding slow but still um nothing to inspire out of that race
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#57:1:A>
He  ' s won it quite easily though Asian Glory

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#58:1:A>
He  ' s uh kept uh up to the mark by James Chio uh really nothing
chasing at all

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#59:1:A>
You can see Universe in the red cap <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#60:1:A>
He uh has ran fourth but he has just battled and uh the favourite
Original

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#61:1:A>
He uh <,> he usually gets a long way back and I think they  ' ve just
tried to run him a little more forward tonight but by doing that he really
hasn't found under pressure <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-016#62:1:B>
Yes he was under a fair bit of pressure a good way from home
never that far off them tonight <,> but hasn't finished the race off that
flash now Dragon Warrior <,> anticipated the start

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#63:1:B>
He absolutely flew the gate and he lands a couple in front of Asian
Warrior Asian Glory I should say who was very prominent <,> straight away
tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#64:1:B>
Now getting into third Universe a bit deep as they run to the first
corner Grand Nam Hoi and Leun Yat Supreme are the four behind them

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#65:1:B>
The favourite Original right on the back of this leading brigade
<,> Explorer in the yellow a little bit deep Siu Yik and alongside of him his
stablemate which was Martini Star who was about to take off and circle the
field as they run into the back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#66:1:B>
And tacking on to the back was Victory Together <,> into the back

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#67:1:B>
And the speed <,> not that quick

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#68:1:B>
Dragon Warrior with a length and a half lead over Asian Glory <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-016#69:1:B>
In third spot Universe travelled well but again didn't finish the
race off today <,> </I>
