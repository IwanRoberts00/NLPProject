And first of all I will give you the route map of today  ' s
itinerary so that we can go through <,> very briefly where we are going to
today okay <&> A LONG BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#11:1:A>

So right now we are still <,> on Tsim Sha Tsui here <,> and now <,>
we are going to <,> Tsuen Wan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#12:1:A>

Our first stop will be at Tsuen Wan Tsuen Wan is <,> one of the new
town in New Territories <,> and there we are going to visit a Buddhist temple
<,> which is called the Chuk Lam Shim Yuen the Chuk Lam monastery

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#13:1:A>

After that we will go to Tai Mo Shan <,> Tai Mo Shan is the highest
mountain in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#14:1:A>

And then we will go to further northern part of New Territories to
visit a market called Luen Wo market <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#15:1:A>

The Luen Wo market is a traditional Chinese open air market <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#16:1:A>

And then we will go to Luk Kan <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#17:1:A>

In Luk Kan we will have a chance to see a border town called Sha
Tau Kok <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#18:1:A>

This border town is very interesting because half of it <,> belongs
to Hong Kong Government and the other half belongs to the Chinese Government
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#19:1:A>

And then we will go to visit a fishing village called Sha Mun Jai

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#20:1:A>

Our final stop will be <,> in Shatin <,> in Shatin <,> we are going

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#21:1:A>

And I hope we will have our lunch <,> at one-thirty <,> okay and
the whole tour will be last for around six hours so uh we will end the tour
at around <.> thre </.> three to three-thirty p.m. <&> A BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#22:1:A>

And now I  ' m going to give you the Land Between sticker <,> if you
don't have this sticker I will give one to you and please put on the sticker
<&> Long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#23:1:A>

So uhm <,> just to remind you if you have any questions please
don't hesitate to ask me I will try my best to answer even I don't know the
answer I will still try my best to make a story for you so don't worry about
it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#24:1:A>

And so far do you have any difficulties in understanding my
Chinglish Chinese English <,> thank you <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#25:1:A>

Uhm now I would like to start the tour by telling you some general
informations about Hong Kong okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#26:1:A>

Uh the population in Hong Kong is already over <,> six millions <,>
and the total land surface area is around one thousand and seventy five
square kilometers <,> so we have a very high population density in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#27:1:A>

The population density in Hong Kong is five thousand five hundred
and ninety <,> per square kilometers as I know the population density in USA
is around six hundred <,> per square kilometer <,> in Britain it  ' s twenty
<,> and in Australia it  ' s only three and some of my guests even told me that
among these three one is the rabbit and the other one is kangaroo <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#28:1:A>

And right now is already the winter time in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#29:1:A>

We have four distinctive season in Hong Kong <,> the Spring <,>
Summer Autumn and Winter <,> and this week uh <.> i </.> is almost the
coldest week <,> in this winter this year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#30:1:A>

Uh the coldest temperature we  ' ve got in the past is around eight
degree Celsius

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#31:1:A>

It is the coldest temperature we have recorded <,,> and the hottest
<,> time in Hong Kong is of course in the summer time <,> the temperature may
be rise up to <,> thirty-four or thirty-five degree Celsius in summer time

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#32:1:A>

And summer is also <,> the main season for raining and typhoon <,>
typhoon in <,> American is uh hurricane in Australia is cyclone okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#33:1:A>

Uhm most of the typhoon in Hong Kong comes from the Philippine so
uh <,> many people say that Philippine is the trouble-maker for us <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#34:1:A>

Such kind of traffic condition is regarded to be very normal <,>
because now is the rush hour <&> A LONG BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#35:1:A>

The red building to your left hand side is the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#36:1:A>

It was a <.> hong </.> it was a post-secondary college <,> but uh
from nineteen ninety-five onward this Hong Kong Polytechnic has been upgraded
as a university <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#37:1:A>

In the year nineteen ninety-four we have only <,> three
universities in Hong Kong <,> The University of Hong Kong The Chinese
University of Hong Kong and the new University of Science and Technology <,>
but starting from nineteen ninety- five onward three more post-secondary
college have been upgraded to uh university The Hong Kong Polytechnic The
Hong Kong City Polytechnic and also The Baptist College so right now we have
totally six universities in Hong Kong <&> A LONG BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#38:1:A>

In most in all the <,> university or post-secondary college their
teaching their teaching medium is English <,> but in the secondary school the
teacher use both English and Cantonese as the teaching medium <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#39:1:A>

This large bus to our right hand side is the direct bus service to
China <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#40:1:A>

Uh they are all normal Hong Kong residents and <,> nowadays many
people many Hong Kong residents

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#41:1:A>

They have another houses another holiday houses <,> in China so
they like to commuting <,> from here to China <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#42:1:A>

And if it is not the first trip for you to come to Hong Kong or <,>
if you have been staying here for a few days I think most of you have already
noticed that <,> there are many Mercedes Benz and BMW in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#43:1:A>

And as I know besides Germany Hong Kong is the largest market for
Mercedes <,> and our government impose almost one hundred to one hundred
fifty percent tax <,> on car

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#44:1:A>

That means <,> the price for the Mercedes and BMW is double as the
price in Germany <&> Long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#45:1:A>

And if you take a look to your right hand side you will see that
the taxi <,> in the Kowloon Peninsula are all in the red colour <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#46:1:A>

In fact there  ' re totally three different taxis in Hong Kong <,>
the blue colour taxi <,> the red colour taxi and the green colour taxi <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#47:1:A>

The blue colour taxi only runs on the Lantau Island <,> and the red
colour taxi <,> are allowed to run all over Hong Kong the Hong Kong <,>
Island Kowloon Peninsula <,> and even in New Territories <,> but <,> the
green colour taxi is only allowed <,> to run in New Territories

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#48:1:A>

It is not allowed <,> to enter in the Kowloon Peninsula or Hong
Kong Island <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#49:1:A>

And if you want to hire a taxi <,> from Hong Kong to Kowloon or
from Kowloon to Hong Kong to cross the Cross Harbour Tunnel <,> you need to
pay <,> twenty more Hong Kong dollars as the tunnel fee <&> long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#50:1:A>

And now if you take a look to your left hand side the road <,>
running underneath this flyover is the Nathan Road <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#51:1:A>

The Nathan Road was built in the nineteen century <,> and it is the
first road to be built on the Kowloon Peninsula <,> the whole the total
length for the Nathan Road is around four kilometers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#52:1:A>

The price <,> is cheaper if you go further away from Tsim Sha Tsui
<&> Long-break </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#53:1:A>

And this large pieces of reclaimed land to your left hand side <,>
is one of the <?> temporal </?> projects for our new airport <,> it is the
West Kowloon Reclamation Project <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#54:1:A>

This reclamation project cost around <,> twelve million Hong Kong
dollars and as I know there will be <,> explore hotels built on this pieces
of land <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#55:1:A>

Our new airport will be built on Lantau Island <,> the giant Buddha
on Lantau Island <,> and there will be a six lane highway linking up the new
airport <,> and there will be a six lanes highway linking up the new airport
<,> to the down town area and also the train <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#56:1:A>

As I know the journey time from the new airport to the down town
area will take you around thirty minutes <,> with the assumption that there
is no traffic jam <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#57:1:A>

And the total construction cost for our new airport is around one
hundred and fifty eight million Hong Kong dollars that is around twenty point
three US dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#58:1:A>

And the new airport <,> I hope the new airport will be finished at
nineteen ninety-seven <,> but it is hard to say because even today the
Chinese and the British government always have argument <,> on the
construction cost for the new airport <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#59:1:A>

The existing airport the Kai Tak International Airport <,> is the
fifth busiest airport in the world and it takes <,> nineteen million
passengers each year <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#60:1:A>

All the buildings now to your left hand side are the post-war
building and they are mainly for residential purpose <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#61:1:A>

They looks very old and dirty <,> because after the legislation in
Hong Kong the residents has no obligation for the maintenance of the building
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#62:1:A>

Uh to live here uh for a house <.> be </.> around fifty square <.>
fif </.> five hundred square feets it may cost you <,> ten thousand Hong Kong
dollar to rent it monthly <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#63:1:A>

And the buildings now to your left hand side belongs to one of the
public housing estate in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#64:1:A>

All the public housing estates in Hong Kong <,> are managed by the
Hong Kong Government <,> and over half of the population that is around three
million peoples <,> are now living in this kind of public housing estate <,>
so the Hong Kong Government is the largest landlord in the world <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#65:1:A>

And the rent for the public housing estate is always keep very low
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#66:1:A>

Usually we need to pay around eight percent that is around eight
hundred to one thousand Hong Kong dollars monthly for the rents <,> and of
course the facilities and the size is <,> very small

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#67:1:A>

I am one of this uh typical Hong Kong residents living in the
public housing estate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#68:1:A>

I  ' m living together with my family <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#69:1:A>

My parent my two sisters and my two brothers <,> including me we
have seven person in my family <,> and my home is only <,> two hundred square
feet <,> <.> sev </.> for seven persons <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#70:1:A>

Two hundred square feet that is around twenty square meter <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#71:1:A>

But uh even the living condition is not very good in the public
housing estate

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#72:1:A>

It is not easy to obtain the units from the government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#73:1:A>

First of all you have be to the Hong Kong residents <,> which
require you to live in Hong Kong for seven years <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#74:1:A>

After you  ' ve got the status of Hong Kong residents you can apply
for the housing for the housing units <,> and as I know the waiting time is
at least six years <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#75:1:A>

So add up together you have to live in Hong Kong for at least
thirteen years before you can get a housing unit <,> from the government <&>
A BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#76:1:A>

And now we have already entered to a private housing estate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#77:1:A>

All these buildings surrounding us <,> are the residential building
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#78:1:A>

This is the Mei Foo Sun Chuen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#79:1:A>

The Mei Foo Sun Chuen is the largest private housing estate in Hong
Kong <,> and some people even said it is the largest private housing estate
in the world <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#80:1:A>

There are totally ninety-nine residential blocks in the Mei Foo Sun
Chuen which accommodate around seventy thousand residents here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#81:1:A>

And if you want to buy a housing unit in Mei Foo Sun Chuen with
around five hundred square feet it may cost you almost <,> two to two point
five million Hong Kong dollars <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#82:1:A>

And again to your left hand side <,> which is the Kwai Chung
Container Ports the Kwai Chung Container Ports is the world busiest the most
busiest container port in the world <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#83:1:A>

And we are now driving in the area called Kwai Chung

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#84:1:A>

The problem of air pollution in Kwai Chung is very serious because
Kwai Chung is a big zone of both residential and industrial buildings so
people living here usually have a higher chance of getting respiratory or
heart diseases but unfortunately I am living in Kwai Chung here <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#85:1:A>

All those building to your right hand side up on the hills <,> are
also the public housing estate <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#86:1:A>

It is very easy to distinguish between the public and the private
housing estate <,> from those <unc> SEVERAL WORDS </unc> having the
bamboo outside the windows

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#87:1:A>

They are the public housing estate <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#88:1:A>

And now if you take a look to your right hand side up on the hill
you will see there is a little building with black and white colour <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#89:1:A>

That is a primary school

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#90:1:A>

When I was a kid I was studying in that primary school <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#91:1:A>

Besides my commentary on this tour the Hong Kong TA also prepare
the commentary from the tape so that you can have a chance to listen to the
real English <&> A BREAK </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#92:1:A>

So we will arrive at our first stop the Chuk Lam monastery in a few
minutes and I am sure you will see many Chinese in the temple so let me teach
you some <,> Cantonese now okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#93:1:A>

Do you know how to say good morning in Cantonese <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#94:1:A>

Good morning in Cantonese is <indig> jou sun </indig> <indig> jou
sun </indig> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#95:1:A>

An easier way for you to remember is <,> the sun of Joe<Indig> jou
sun </indig>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#96:1:A>

<indig> Jou sun </indig> is good morning

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#97:1:A>

And to say thank you we have two different ways <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#98:1:A>

First when people give you a service <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> a
service you say <indig> mh gon </indig> close your mouth first <indig> mh gon
</indig> <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-024#99:1:A>

Another way to say thank you is that when <,> someone give you a
present a gift <,> you say <indig> dor tsai </indig> <indig> dor tsai
</indig> </I>
