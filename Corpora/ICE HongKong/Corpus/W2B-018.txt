<ICE-HK:W2B-018#4:1>
I have always been of the opinion that since only about one in
five teenagers in Hong Kong gets admitted to universities , tertiary students
cannot be that bad . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#5:1>
So if we feel that their learning attitude , language ability and
social skills are poor beyond belief - as media reports have recently
suggested - there must be something wrong with society as well as the
educational system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#6:1>
Students should not have to bear all the blame and responsibility for
such a sorry state of affairs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#7:1>
That is not to say that I enjoy teaching them . I , like many of
my colleagues , find teaching undergraduates increasingly dissatisfying .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#8:1>
I also find that students today lack learning spirit , are unwilling
to express themselves in English in class and are inconsiderate ,
uncooperative and immature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#9:1>
I once remonstrated with my students about their lack of
initiative to look up material beyond lecture notes and PowerPoint slide
handouts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#10:1>
One retorted: &ldquo; University students these days are really bad ,
Miss .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#11:1>
Don't expect much of us . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#12:1>
I have come to the conclusion that a lot of the students , rather
than feeling shame about their inability to learn , are instead assertive in
demanding to be spoonfed knowledge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#13:1>
Most experienced university lecturers would agree that teaching
evening-class mature students is more satisfying than teaching undergraduates .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#14:1>
We also know that teaching final-year undergraduates is easier than
teaching first-year freshmen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#15:1>
Teaching electives is better than teaching compulsory core subjects ,
and teaching small classes of 15 or so is far more gratifying than giving
mass lectures by cramming in 200 students .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#16:1>
In such lectures , students come in late - if they come at all - talk
among themselves or on their mobiles , read newspapers and take naps . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#17:1>
Ironically , there is at least a handful of students in each mass
lecture who fully comprehend our English lessons and are eager to listen to
the lecturer  ' s every word .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#18:1>
They are usually as angry and frustrated as the lecturer about the
noise their classmates make .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#19:1>
My heart goes out to this minority because they are the most
shortchanged by educational institutions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#20:1>
In spite of all of this , I emphasise that I still believe we
should not be bashing students .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#21:1>
The top 20 per cent of the youth population cannot be that hopeless .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#22:1>
This is reflected by teachers ' interactions with students outside
class .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#23:1>
Although students behave unforgivably in classes , they are quite
different when I talk to them on an individual basis , or in small groups .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#24:1>
The same bunch , unmanageable in lectures , turn more polite ,
considerate and sympathetic to their teacher  ' s difficulties .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#25:1>
They are more willing to listen and learn beyond the textbook , to
accept challenges , debate and critically evaluate learning material , and
even more willing to listen to and speak in English . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#26:1>
Not all , but most of my students come across as moderately well
rounded , mature adults when I talk to them in my office or during breaks or
in committee meetings , yet I find them intolerably immature in class .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#27:1>
I am sure the feeling is mutual .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#28:1>
They probably find me a more approachable , amiable , human and fun
person when I am not lecturing them along with 200 others on a core subject
in which they may or may not have any interest but which they are compelled
to take . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#29:1>
Herein lies one of the keys to overhauling university education .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#30:1>
In recent years , universities have pushed too hard , too fast for
research and publication , to the detriment of teaching quality .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#31:1>
While I am not against putting pressure on academic staff to engage
in more research , the pendulum has swung too far , without properly
balancing a lecturer  ' s duty to publish and their duty to look after students .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#32:1>
Theoretically , the more academics engage in scholarly activities
, the wider and deeper their knowledge becomes , and this can only benefit
teaching quality because they have more knowledge to impart and inspire .
However , the reality is that intense research pressure is causing a lot of
lecturers to withdraw into the more solitary pursuits of writing , designing
questionnaires and undertaking other activities to further their research .
They have become less inclined to spend informal time with their students .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#33:1>
To give teachers more time to do research , university management
is combining classes , further reducing lecturers ' contact hours with
students .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#34:1>
Resources are channelled into upgrading sound and visual equipment to
make lectures look good .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#35:1>
Money is being spent to build better and more classrooms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#36:1>
But all this ignores the fact that the quality of students ' class
life is being lowered .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#37:1>
Students find themselves speaking less and listening more , partly
because classes are larger and partly because most feel more intimidated by
the idea of speaking up in front of so many people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#38:1>
They feel exhausted attending too many big classes and not enough
smaller , more lively ones .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#39:1>
As the distance between students and teachers widens , fewer students
feel motivated to chat with their teachers , while teachers themselves have
become less patient in interacting with students . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#40:1>
Students need nurture and care .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#41:1>
If universities continue to disenfranchise teachers from providing
this to students , we only have ourselves to blame for the declining
standards of student behaviour and knowledge . </p>

The Democrats may have their troubles , but how long will the DAB
last as political toadies to the administration , asks <it> Claudia Mo </it>
</h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#44:2>
<bold> The party born to be Beijing  ' s ` footman ' </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#45:2>
<bold> THERE HAS BEEN </bold> much talk about the future , or the
lack of it , of the Democratic Party , and how it is hampered by its own
anti-Beijing stance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#46:2>
But the same can be said about the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong &obrack;  DAB &cbrack; - though for the opposite reason that the DAB
's pro-Beijing position is unlikely to lead it anywhere either . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#47:2>
The ultimate goal of a political party is to grab ruling power ,
although it remains arguable that party politics has already been shunned in
the SAR , with the Government establishing the rule that whoever becomes
Chief Executive must sever party links . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#48:2>
Under the existing system of selecting a Chief Executive , it
seems no Democrat could ever make it into that office .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#49:2>
Neither could a member of the DAB , such as its chairman Tsang
Yok-sing , because that would mean overstepping the bounds Beijing has
prescribed for the office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#50:2>
China  ' s line of thinking over how the SAR should be run was made
clear before the handover , when Tung Chee-hwa was favoured for his business
connections and his lack of visible political ties .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#51:2>
This helped minimise political agitation in the SAR . After all , as
far as Beijing is concerned , stability and prosperity come first . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#52:2>
Unlike the Democratic Party , which enjoys a clear-cut image as a
resistance force , the DAB  ' s position is becoming increasingly blurred .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#53:2>
Although it could never go into opposition , it is also losing its
role as the Government  ' s staunch defender . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#54:2>
During a meet-the-press session earlier this year , Mr Tsang
himself catalogued the DAB  ' s public-relations weak points as being pro-China
and playing &ldquo; the emperor  ' s guards &rdquo; for the Government .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#55:2>
More recently , he again publicly lamented that government officials
always assumed the DAB was their rescue team and that &ldquo; when we
disagree with the Government on barely one issue out of 10 , they are very
unhappy" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#56:2>
That perception of the DAB playing &ldquo; firemen &rdquo; is shared
by the population at large . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#57:2>
Although the Government has now expressed its desire to count
more on the backing of the business sector - as reflected in the recent call
by Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang Yam-kuen for businessmen
to join politics - it still needs to garner the supporting votes of the DAB
in the Legislative Council .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#58:2>
This has prompted a situation in which although the party wishes to
appear less pro-establishment , it knows it cannot go too far in this
direction . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#59:2>
That has resulted in a shift of its stance on quite a few issues .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#60:2>
Examples range from the call for the sacking of Andrew Lo Cheung-on ,
Mr Tung  ' s senior special assistant , for his alleged role in putting
pressure on University of Hong Kong pollster Robert Chung Ting-yiu to scale
back surveys on the Chief Executive  ' s popularity , to toll hikes for the
Cross-Harbour Tunnel in 1999 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#61:2>
In both cases , DAB legislators were at first seen to be going along
with public opinion - which favoured Mr Lo  ' s sacking and the rejection of
the toll increases - but finally gave in and supported the Government  ' s
wishes . </p> <O> A picture </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#62:2>
Incidents of this kind involving the DAB have certainly further
put off those Hong Kong people who were never the party  ' s fans in the first
place .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#63:2>
Although it is broadly accepted that the party disagrees with the
Government on local livelihood matters , it is understood by all that when it
comes to defending Beijing-related political or ideological issues , the DAB
has to be there , bang on cue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#64:2>
The party  ' s function of influencing public opinion , as far as
the Government is concerned , might be weakening .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#65:2>
Since former chief secretary for administration Anson Chan Fang
On-sang  ' s departure earlier this year , top government officials have
evidently become more daring and almost strident about defending policies on
their own , adopting a kind of like-it-or-leave-it attitude , as displayed by
Secretary for Security Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Secretary for Justice Elsie
Leung Oi-sie on the security and legal fronts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#66:2>
Mr Tsang Yok-sing and his veteran left-wing comrades are also
losing out in the patriots ' games .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#67:2>
Since the handover , their competitors have popped up in various
shapes and forms , including patriotic businessmen and delegates to the
National People  ' s Congress and the Chinese People  ' s Political Consultative
Conference .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#68:2>
Many of these people consider themselves more senior in social as
well as political echelons , regarding themselves as butlers - or even guests
- of the master , while DAB types are mere footmen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#69:2>
The DAB chairman is a fairly appealing , if not charismatic ,
political leader .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#70:2>
His intellectual flair often charms his audiences .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#71:2>
But his less intellectually blessed colleagues often prove to be
embarrassing , making tactless remarks which to some amount to intellectual
poverty .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#72:2>
DAB legislator Chan Kam-lam equated Mrs Chan , upon her departure ,
to any doorman stationed outside government headquarters , while fellow party
legislator Ip Kwok-him accused legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing of &ldquo; only
wanting to satisfy personal desires &rdquo; over Ms Lau  ' s plan to force a
disclosure of confidential details linked to the recent award of the Grand
Bauhinia Medal to Yeung Kwong , a 1967 riots ringleader . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#73:2>
But this does not mean the death of the DAB .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#74:2>
With Beijing  ' s endorsement , it never seems to worry about money .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#75:2>
Although it might be losing clout in a number of ways , it is still
deemed a necessary &ldquo; grassroots organisation &rdquo; outside official
organs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#76:2>
Indeed , it still commands strong , traditional left-wing support ,
much of it from the working class . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#77:2>
One danger lurks , however , as whatever the DAB can offer to
workers , so can unionist legislators Lau Chin-shek and Lee Cheuk-yan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#78:2>
These two Frontier members often quip that they are the only genuine
leftists . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#79:2>
The DAB will lose its substance as a political party but will
remain an ideological group with rising Chinese nationalism as its key
binding force .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#80:2>
The difference between feeling ethnically Chinese and being
politically Chinese , however , should be noted .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#81:2>
And Hong Kong  ' s China fever will essentially feature the dollar sign .

Government manipulation is eroding legislators ' ability to function ,
says <it> Andrew Cheng </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#85:3>
<bold> A CLAUSE IN THE </bold> Basic Law , which limits
legislators ' power to introduce private-member  ' s bills , has been so
manipulated by the Government that it makes a mockery of the power vested in
the SAR legislature under the Sino-British Joint Declaration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#86:3>
In Hong Kong , private-member  ' s bills were once major catalysts
for law reform .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#87:3>
One well-known example was former legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk  ' s
attempt to introduce anti-discrimination laws in 1994 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#88:3>
With strong public support , Ms Wu  ' s move eventually prompted the
then-colonial government to enact laws against discrimination due to sex and
disability , and to set up the Equal Opportunities Commission , of which Ms
Wu is now the chairperson . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#89:3>
In the legislative session of 1996-1997 alone , 40 private-
member  ' s bills were introduced and 22 of them became law .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#90:3>
However , in the first term of the post-handover Legislative Council
, only two private-member  ' s bills were tabled .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#91:3>
Why is this so ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#92:3>
Are legislators becoming lazier ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#93:3>
The answer lies in the Article 74 of the Basic Law , under which
members of Legco are prohibited from introducing bills relating to &ldquo;
public expenditure" , &ldquo; political structure" , or " the operation of
the Government" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#94:3>
If interpreted broadly , these restrictions can effectively strip
legislators of the power to initiate any bills at all . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#95:3>
Of these restrictions , the only one that applied during the
colonial era was the one on public expenditure - or &ldquo; charging effect"
, as it was then termed - but even then the restriction was not absolute , as
the governor could exercise his discretion to allow such a bill to be tabled .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#96:3>
The Basic Law , the SAR  ' s mini-constitution , does not give the
Chief Executive such discretionary power . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#97:3>
What is more , the concept of &ldquo; relate to public
expenditure &rdquo; seems to cover a much wider scope than &ldquo; charging
effect &rdquo; did before the handover .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#98:3>
It can mean a possible increase in public expenditure or a possible
decrease .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#99:3>
It can also be extended to mean consequential and incidental
government spending . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#100:3>
For instance , Legco president Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai ruled
against the introduction of a Fair Competition Bill proposed by democrats
Fred Li Wah-ming and Sin Chung-kai because it was related to &ldquo; public
expenditure" , although the bill did not directly impose any obligation on
the Government to spend more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#101:3>
But Mrs Fan seemed to be satisfied with the Government  ' s
argument that the bill could result in more legal action against anti-
competitive behaviour , which would increase the court  ' s workload and thus
ultimately cost the Government more .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#102:3>
Applying the logic of this ruling , it is virtually impossible for
legislators to propose any bill that creates new legal rights . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#103:3>
Although it is perfectly legitimate to interpret the various
restrictions of Article 74 in a literal way and give them a wide meaning , it
is also possible to read them in a narrower way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#104:3>
And if we agree that the Basic Law gives legislators the power to
initiate laws , it is logical and reasonable that a more lenient
interpretation should be adopted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#105:3>
In addition to the already-mentioned three &ldquo; forbidden
areas" , Article 74 also requires a legislator to seek the Chief Executive  ' s
consent before being able to introduce any bill relating to &ldquo;
government policies" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#106:3>
What criteria the Chief Executive should adopt to exercise his
discretion is anyone  ' s guess . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#107:3>
Earlier this year , I sought to introduce the Employment &obrack; 
Amendment &cbrack; Bill to give employees more protection against wage cuts forced on
them by employers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#108:3>
Despite strong support from workers , my application for the Chief
Executive  ' s consent to introduce the bill was turned down .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#109:3>
The Government claimed the bill was inconsistent with its policy of
not regulating wage reductions by legislation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#110:3>
Recently , I also proposed the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes
( Amendment &cbrack; Bill , but the Government said my attempt to raise the minimum
monthly income level at which an employee becomes liable for MPF
contributions from &dollar;4,000 to &dollar;6,000 conflicted with government
policy , which intended to provide its own mechanism for adjusting the income
level at which employees became liable to pay contributions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#111:3>
However , the Government has not established any such mechanism .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#112:3>
Since the handover , Article 74 has been effectively manipulated
by the Government to defeat legislators ' attempts to initiate legislative
changes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#113:3>
The Chinese Government acknowledged in the Joint Declaration
that the legislative power of the SAR shall be vested in the SAR  ' s
legislature , and Article 73(1 &cbrack; of the Basic Law empowers the SAR legislature
to &ldquo; enact , amend or repeal laws in accordance with the provisions of
[ the Basic Law &cbrack; and legal procedures" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#114:3>
Logically , Legco  ' s law-making function should not be confined
to passing bills submitted by the Government but should also include the
power to propose legislative measures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#115:3>
In a study of parliaments in more than 80 countries , the Inter-
Parliamentary Union concluded that &ldquo; it is implicit in the concept of
democracy that the initiative in law-making should vest with the elected
parliament" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#116:3>
Legco  ' s law-making is being eroded , causing people to lose
confidence in their elected representatives .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#117:3>
To enable legislators to perform their law-making function as stated
in the Basic Law , the Government should give the various restrictions a
narrower and more specific meaning .

<ICE-HK:W2B-018#118:3>
This is consistent with the purpose of Article 73(1 &cbrack; of the Basic
Law and the central Government  ' s declared basic policies towards the SAR .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-018#119:3>
In the long run , if the SAR is to move towards a more
democratic society , the restrictions imposed under Article 74 should be
repealed . </p>
