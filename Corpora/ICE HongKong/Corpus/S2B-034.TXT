Hong Kong is a city of good fortune

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#2:1:A>
The Asian financial crisis which is started in Thailand in July
nineteen ninety seven caused the severe damage to the economy not only in
Thailand but also in South Korea Indonesia Malaysia and the Philippines

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#3:1:A>
As a result many companies went down people lost jobs and
governments were forced out of office

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#4:1:A>
Hong Kong did not escape the crisis and <unc> 1 WORD </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#5:1:A>
Our property prices dropped by fifty to sixty percent and to this
day some two hundred thousand home owners still suffer from the negative
equity burden

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#6:1:A>
At the peak of the storm our GDP contracted by six point nine
percent in nineteen ninety eight and the jobless rate top to six point three
percent in nineteen ninety nine

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#7:1:A>
It was the worst downturn in the last forty years and Hong Kong
people were despaired and disillusioned about the future

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#8:1:A>
However despite the deep recession and human suffering Hong Kong has
managed to very well to overcome the difficulty imposed as strong GDP growth
of around ten percent in two thousand

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#9:1:A>
This growth figure itself made the SAR Government officials very
proud indeed

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#10:1:A>
Apart from the growth statistics the jobless rate remains high
today at four point three percent down from six point three percent in
nineteen ninety nine

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#11:1:A>
This is of course not acceptable to Hong Kong people who used to
enjoy almost full employment in the past years

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#12:1:A>
In fact this high unemployment rate poses serious problem for the
SAR Government and measures have to be taken to improve the situation

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#13:1:A>
Many people believe the root of the problem is the <unc> 1-WORD
</unc> out of our manufacturing industry

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#14:1:A>
In the nineteen seventies Hong Kong  ' s economy was led by
export-oriented manufacturing industries which contributed twenty four
percent to our GDP and employed over nine hundred thousand people

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#15:1:A>
Today manufacturing industry contribution to GDP dropped to about
six percent and employment is down to two hundred forty thousand people

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#16:1:A>
This structural change of the economy has placed about half a
million workers out of manufacturing jobs and many of them are not fitted for
employment in the service sector

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#17:1:A>
Having the manufacturing industries in Hong Kong is of strategic
importance

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#18:1:A>
It creates more employment to our workers and provides a foundation
pillar to our economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#19:1:A>
It is believed that an economy dominated by property and service
sectors like Hong Kong would be vulnerable to another possible financial
attack in the future

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#20:1:A>
Moreover the manufacturing industry will absorb a large number of
low-skilled workers thus spare them from the social welfare net

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#21:1:A>
If this can be achieved it will also helped reduce income disparity
and prevent it from developing into a social problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#22:1:A>
One may wonder why they have lost that majority of our
manufacturing industry in the past twenty years

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#23:1:A>
There are two principle reasons that have caused our factories to
slowly move over the border to the Pearl River Delta region

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#24:1:A>
The first and the most important reason is the open door policy of
China that began in ninety seventy nine

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#25:1:A>
Manufacturing in China made a lot of sense in competition on the
world market and the migration accelerated in the early nineteen nineties

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#26:1:A>
Several years later domestic manufacturing in Hong Kong shrank to
less than six percent of GDP in two thousand

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#27:1:A>
This has jeopardized the health of our economy as a whole and
impact on our employment

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#28:1:A>
The second reason is that on further consideration one cannot help
but blame the former Hong Kong Government  ' s <.> em </.> empathy for failing
to keep manufacturing in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#29:1:A>
Unfortunately the long cherished the well warm policies of positive
non-intervention and not <unc> 1 WORD </unc> winners have lingered
over into today  ' s SAR Government after the transition in nineteen ninety
seven

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#30:1:A>
This somehow has strong influence on the high ranking officials'
thinking and decision making and therefore has delayed <,> the SAR Government
to adopt a proactive industrial policy and take the necessary appropriate
actions

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#31:1:A>
When discussing about manufacturing in Hong Kong people may cite
<unc> 1 WORD </unc> and <unc> 2 WORDS </unc> as our
deficiency

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#32:1:A>
Contrary to such common belief one can argue that since high-tech
industry and high value added products have survived very well in developed
countries like Switzerland Germany Finland and the Sweden in Europe Canada
and USA in America Taiwan Singapore and Japan in Asia there is good reason to
believe that they can flourish in Hong Kong if nourished properly

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#33:1:A>
Successful experience in other countries has also shown that
developing high-tech industries will require technology talent money and a
positive government attitude

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#34:1:A>
Among these elements and based on other countries ' experience
government policy plays a critical role

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#35:1:A>
Apart from providing tax holidays and other attractive <.> inten
</.> incentives the government can also provide financial assistance to start
up companies and allow import of engineers

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#36:1:A>
Especially at the early stage of a high-tech development the
government must take the lead in investing RND

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#37:1:A>
Once successful the generic technology can be licensed to several
contributing companies for further development into products for the world
market

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#38:1:A>
Taiwan is a good example

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#39:1:A>
In a short twenty years Taiwan has become the world power house for
high-tech products

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#40:1:A>
With regard to talents Hong Kong has a large pool of scientists and
engineers in our universities and the private sector

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#41:1:A>
Besides there are over two hundred thousand scientists and
engineers currently studying and doing a research in western countries

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#42:1:A>
They are ready to serve in Hong Kong if the opportunity arises
which can make their dream come true

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#43:1:A>
There are also doubts that while our closet competitors Taiwan and
Singapore have advanced very far in the high-tech industry one may question
if it is too late for Hong Kong to enter the arena now

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#44:1:A>
The answer is an absolute no

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#45:1:A>
Although high-tech industry is developing very fast the new product
life cycle is getting shorter

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#46:1:A>
That means one can step in at the front at any time use an
up-to-date technology to compete head on with other players on the same
market

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#47:1:A>
In conclusion one can see that in the high-tech business although
Hong Kong is late to enter the competition but we are not out

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#48:1:A>
So long as the SAR Government can make a quick U-turn and recognise
the reality of the global high-tech business as well as the position of Hong
Kong and come up a set of policy to promote investment local manufacturing
and innovation we can and will put Hong Kong on a high-tech map within a
short time </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#49:2:A>
The Summer of nineteen ninety six a young Hong Kong woman
stood before the world  ' s media and proudly declared Hong Kong athlete are
not rubbish

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#50:2:A>
That young woman was of course Hong Kong  ' s first ever Olympic gold
medal winner Lee Lai-shan

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#51:2:A>
Since San San  ' s triumph in Atlanta a host of local athletes have
taken up a challenge of showing the world just what they can do

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#52:2:A>
Within weeks of our first Olympic gold medal wheelchair fencer Ben
Cheung claimed a remarkable four gold medals in the <,> Paralympic Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#53:2:A>
In nineteen ninety seven cyclist Wong Kam-po beat the best that
China had to offer in winning the SAR  ' s first ever gold at the National
Games in Shanghai

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#54:2:A>
And in December ninety eight less than two years ago I was
privileged to witness our sportsmen and women in action at the Bangkok Asian
Games where they captured a total of five gold six silver and six bronze
altogether seventeen medals far and away Hong Kong  ' s best ever performance
at a major international games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#55:2:A>
Buoyed by our success in Bangkok and by the local community  ' s
enthusiastic response to our athletes ' achievements officials of Hong Kong  ' s
Olympic movement decided that the time was ripe to push for Hong Kong sport
to reach a new level

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#56:2:A>
In June of last year the Honourable Timothy Fok who is the
President of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong China
or the SF and OC for short declared publicly that the SF and OC was planning
to mount a bid to host the two o o six Asian Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#57:2:A>
Shortly afterwards in his role as representative of the sports
community in the Legislative Council Tim Fok moved a motion related to
support for hosting the Asian Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#58:2:A>
Speaking during the debate I outlined Government  ' s support in
principle to the idea of the SAR staging Asia  ' s biggest sporting event

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#59:2:A>
Tim Fok  ' s motion received the unanimous support of Legco members

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#60:2:A>
Government  ' s early expression of encouragement for the idea of
hosting the Games was based on the view that such an undertaking would be
likely to bring positive international exposure for Hong Kong as well as
helping to boost the further development of sport in the SAR

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#61:2:A>
However before committing to a firm expression of support for the
SF and OC  ' s bid it was necessary for us to take a more detailed look at a
number of related issues

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#62:2:A>
Most important of these were the suitability of our sports
facilities and the potential cost to the tax-payer for hosting the Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#63:2:A>
To help us assess the state of our sports venues we sought help
from one of the leading architects for the Sydney Olympic facilities

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#64:2:A>
After an exhaustive and exhausting week touring the SAR  ' s
facilities and studying site plans and Asian Games requirements the architect
and his team concluded that Hong Kong would be capable in two o o six of
hosting the best Asian Games ever

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#65:2:A>
Admittedly some work would need to be done on upgrading venues or
installing temporary spectator and media facilities

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#66:2:A>
But in general the Sydney-based architect  ' s report assured us that
Hong Kong had venues well capable of hosting the Asian Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#67:2:A>
Getting a clear idea of the likely financial implications of
hosting the Games was a little more difficult

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#68:2:A>
Projecting likely revenues and expenditure one year ahead is
difficult enough never mind six to seven years

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#69:2:A>
In addition much of the information which formed the basis of our
financial studies was naturally sensitive given that we are in a situation
where we are competing with other cities for the right to host the Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#70:2:A>
This sensitivity required us to be careful about revealing too much
financial information too early and led in some quarters to claims that
Government was deliberately hiding bad news in order not to jeopardize the
Games bid

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#71:2:A>
Fortunately these misunderstandings have now been dispelled

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#72:2:A>
Throughout the process of our financial studies Government
undertook to release publicly at the appropriate time a full report on our
findings

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#73:2:A>
In line with our commitment to be open and transparent on this
issue we presented our findings to both the Home Affairs Panel and the
Finance Committee of Legco at the beginning of this month

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#74:2:A>
On twelve May the Finance Committee voted by a huge majority to
endorse the bid to host the two o o six Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#75:2:A>
I believe that Legco  ' s endorsement reflects a view throughout the
community that hosting the Asian Games can bring significant benefits to Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#76:2:A>
This may seems at odds with the findings of our financial studies
which projected a likely Games operating deficit

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#77:2:A>
But this is not just about money rather it is an opportunity to
show our Asian partners and the whole world that there is much more to Hong
Kong than the relentless pursuit of material wealth

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#78:2:A>
In bidding to host the two o o six Asian games we are making a
statement about Hong Kong  ' s position in Asia and the world and about our
society  ' s aspirations

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#79:2:A>
The Games from the bidding process right through to the closing
ceremony offer us a unique opportunity to showcase our strengths and at the
same time galvanize the community in support of a common aim namely to excel
both as a host to Asia  ' s biggest event and as a player in the Games

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#80:2:A>
Throughout the bidding process we will be creative and diligent in
ensuring that we put the best possible case for Hong Kong to the Olympic
Council of Asia

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#81:2:A>
At the same time we will be scrupulous in sticking to our
principles of competing on a level playing field

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#82:2:A>
We recognize that the bids from other cities are strong but we are
confident that we can win a fair fight

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#83:2:A>
Our bidding team led by the Chief Secretary for Administration is
experienced and resourceful and I have no doubt that we will set the standard
by which other bids are measured

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#84:2:A>
And if successful what then

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#85:2:A>
We recognise the need to nurture the natural successors to the
current generation of top athletes

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#86:2:A>
To this end we will continue to develop a sports policy which will
encourage the stars of the future to commit themselves to training and
competition at the highest levels

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#87:2:A>
This policy must provide for greater participation at all levels of
the community

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#88:2:A>
We should also ensure that we have the facilities which properly
designed and managed will serve the needs of the sportsmen and women of all
ages

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#89:2:A>
This is in line with Government  ' s quote Sports for All unquote
policy and with what I said at the Legco Finance Committee meeting that each
and every person should have a sporting chance

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#90:2:A>
My own vision is that in two o o six our unique city will provide
the perfect back- drop for the two-week celebration of all that is best in
Asian sport

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#91:2:A>
Our dynamic multilingual community will bring excitement and colour
to the event

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#92:2:A>
And our athletes will once again do us proud this time on their
home ground and among their own friends and families

<ICE-HK:S2B-034#93:2:A>
The best ever Asian Games will be in Hong Kong for sure </I>
