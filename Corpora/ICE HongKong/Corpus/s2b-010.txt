Out with the old and in with the new

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#2:1:A>
Not only will the next Legislative Council session have a new
president but there will also be a new way of studying bills <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#3:1:A>
The way was paved today for the establishment of a committee system
with members approving a motion to amend Legco  ' s standing orders <,>

May Wong reports <O> report by May Wong with speech by Elsie Tu </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-010#5:1:B>
As the changes to the present system <,> this new structure
brings is minimal

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#6:1:B>
I therefore call for the review to take place in six month  ' s time
as oppose to twelve

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#7:1:B>
For to leave it until the end of nineteen ninety-three session would
leave very little time for any further upgrading to take effect <O> report by
May Wong continues </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-010#8:1:C>
And a fierce debate is taking place in the Legislative Council
now on the unconditional renewal of China  ' s most favoured nation trading
status with the United States

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#9:1:C>
Banker Vincent Cheng moved the motion urging members to support the
call <,> but the United Democrats say such a move would give the US a wrong
impression of Hong Kong people <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-010#11:1:D>
Despite President Bush  ' s decision to renew unconditionally
China  ' s MFN status <,> some members of the US Congress want to impose
political demands as conditions for renewal such as human rights

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#12:1:D>
However it would be wrong to mix trade issues with human rights
issues <O> report by May Wong continues with translated speech of Huang
Chen-Ya from Legco </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-010#13:1:E>
Listening to Dr Huang Chen-Ya  ' s speech <,,> which gives me
the feeling that he is totally ignorant of Hong Kong  ' s economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#14:1:E>
I wonder how many times Dr Huang Chen-Ya has gone to China in the
last two years <,> has seen for himself the development of China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#15:1:E>
And his knowledge of China is zilch <,> in my view <O> speech by

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#16:1:C>
Work began today on a multi-billion dollar development project
in Macao despite criticism from China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#17:1:C>
A statement released by the Sino-Portuguese Land Group last night
charged that Macao had let the nineteen hectares of land go cheaply

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#18:1:C>
The Group is asking the Macao Government to raise the land premium
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#19:1:C>
Chairman of the company undertaking the project tycoon Stanley Ho
said he was puzzled by China  ' s reaction to the project <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#20:1:C>
He added mainland partners are involved in the ambitious plan to
develop reclaimed land in <?> Fa Gwon </?> Bay

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#21:1:C>
He hopes China and Macao can negotiate the matter soon <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#22:1:C>
The Sino-Portuguese Land Group which deals with land use in the
Portuguese enclave ahead of the Chinese takeover in nineteen ninety-nine has
refused to recognized the leasehold agreement <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#23:1:C>
Portuguese officials say Macao is allowed to grant up to twenty
hectares of land a year without the group  ' s approval

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#24:1:A>
The summit of the world  ' s seven leading industrial nations
has ended with promises of help <?> to </?> the former Soviet Union but no
agreement on trade disputes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#25:1:A>
It appears Boris Yeltsin got most of what he wanted out of the
summit <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#26:1:A>
He says he  ' s happy with an agreement on debt relief

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#27:1:A>
The G Seven leaders have promised twenty four billion dollars in
aid <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#28:1:A>
In other news from the summit US Secretary of State James Baker
expressed disappointment the meeting failed to achieve a breakthrough on
world trade talks <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#29:1:A>
Officials said the combination of a French referendum on European
unity and the US election prevented France and the United States from making
a deal on agricultural disputes

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#30:1:A>
The G Seven leaders have set the end of the year as a deadline for
concluding the Uruguay round of GATT talks <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#31:1:A>
The summit also failed to reach an agreement on setting up a fund
to repair dangerous nuclear reactors in Russia and Eastern Europe

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#32:1:A>
One thing the leaders did agree on was a statement concerning China

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#33:1:A>
They welcome Beijing  ' s economic reforms <,> but said China  ' s
human rights record has not kept pace

Canada  ' s nine English-speaking provinces have reached an
agreement aimed at stopping French-speaking Quebec from separating

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#48:1:A>
The deal would take some powers away from the Federal Government
and give Quebec special status <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#49:1:A>
It would also alter the Canadian Government creating an elected
Upper House <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#50:1:A>
The deal still has to be approved by Quebec the Provincial
Legislatures and the Federal Government

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#51:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#55:1:A>
He adds that the question would have to be resolved and there would

The International Air Transport Association representing over
two hundred airlines is up in arms over having to pay for the new Chek Lap
Kok Airport before it  ' s even opened

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#58:1:C>
The airlines have been passing the extra costs to their passengers
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#59:1:C>
IATA is complaining about the so-called Chek Lap Kok element that
has been added to charges for airlines using Kai Tak Airport <O> speech by
Gunter Eser Director of I.A.T.A. </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#60:1:C>
And the airline customer will bear the brunt of it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#61:1:C>
It was noted that landing charges for seven four seven aircraft
will be raised from nine thousand three hundred dollars in nineteen
eighty-nine to sixty thousand dollars when Chek Lap Kok Airport opens in
nineteen ninety-seven

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#X62:1:Z>
Every year the airlines make cost justification to the Hong <?>
Kong </?> Government for fare increase and <,> the for last uh two three
years it  ' s in the region of seven percent to ten percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#X63:1:Z>
But with a sharp increase in land charges the percentage would
have to be raised </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-010#64:1:C>
In total the airlines will be paying over four billion dollars
from now to nineteen ninety-seven towards building Chek Lap Kok Airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#65:1:C>
IATA believes the amount could come instead from the more than ten
billion dollars to be collected from departure tax at Kai Tak in the same
period <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#66:1:C>
The airlines also think the government has underestimated the rate
of air traffic growth and that the new airport will actually be lucrative
without the excessive charges <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#67:1:C>
IATA also suggested if money is that short the Hong Kong government
could borrow more money issue bonds or let the airlines take up equity <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#68:1:C>
Beijing is already baulking at existing debt equity provisions but
IATA is not about to get involved in that dispute <O> speech by Gunter Eser
</O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#69:1:C>
Linus Cheng admits all IATA can do is to try to talk to the Hong
Kong Government into letting the airlines off lightly <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#70:1:C>
Legco  ' s Select Committee studying the future electoral system has
submitted its report to the full council

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#71:1:C>
The report suggests that the territory should be divided into nine
constituencies to elect twenty members to Legco in nineteen ninety-five

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#72:1:C>
Each constituency will be allocated two directly elected seats but
two constituencies with bigger populations will each get three seats <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#73:1:C>
The report suggests that each voter should only be allowed to cast
one vote

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#74:1:C>
The recommendation sparked a fierce debate among legislators

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#75:1:C>
Some members criticize the multi-seat single-vote system for
depriving the voters of their rightful choices <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#76:1:C>
Others said the system would allow small political groups a chance
to compete for a seat in the council

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#77:1:C>
Legco will hold a motion debate on the issue next week <,,>

There have been more than fifty recorded fatalities during the

<ICE-HK:S2B-010#115:1:C>
