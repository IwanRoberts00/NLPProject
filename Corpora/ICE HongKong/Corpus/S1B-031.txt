Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X2:1:Z>
Legco last week voted down the motion calling on Chief Executive to
fire his special assistant Andrew Lo

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X3:1:Z>
But another legislator Martin Lee tends a move a revolution calling
on Legco to set up its own investigation into the matter

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X4:1:Z>
Later in the programme after talking about the Andrew Lo issue we  ' ll
discuss what Hong Kong can learn from the US presidential election

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X5:1:Z>
With us tonight are two legislators Margaret Ng who proposes the
Andrew Lo motion and Howard Young who oppose it

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X6:1:Z>
Welcome both of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X7:1:Z>
Uh before starting the programme I wanted to let both of you know
that we invited Andrew Lo to appear on Newsline and unfortunately he turned
us down

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X8:1:Z>
Now Margaret <,> why did you move this motion </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#9:1:A>
Uhm uhm what about an overdeveloped the sense of duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#10:1:A>
I mean to be serious uh academic freedom is a very important issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#11:1:A>
It is something protected by the Basic Law <,> uh what the
university does with it is the university  ' s business

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#12:1:A>
But even the Executive interferes with that <.> du </.> that that
the freedom then Legco has a duty and the power to intervene

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#13:1:A>
Uhm the the matter at the time caused a lot of public concern

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#14:1:A>
There was an investigation panel the panel made an extremely
serious uh judgment on Andrew Lo

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#15:1:A>
And that was widely accepted by the public

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#16:1:A>
Now at that time because there was no Legislative Council in
existent uh or at least no Legco members in existent nothing could be done
about <{> <[> it </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#17:1:A>
So as soon as a new Legco <?> convince </?> and I think it is it is
right <,> to take up the matter

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X18:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X19:1:Z>
Uhm but you know the Chief Executive are defended uh Andrew Lo and
said that uh he thought he was uh an honest person even though the panel said
he he was <,> uh not a <?> trueful </?> <{> <[> witness </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#20:1:A>
<[> Well </[> </{> that  ' s particular uh uh particularly
because he said so

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#21:1:A>
I think many people took exception to it it uh at the time

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#22:1:A>
Because here  ' s the panel who was seen to be fair very open <?>
transparen </?> everybody heard the evidence

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#23:1:A>
And at the end of this careful investigation has having listen to
many people the panel came to such a a rational uh conclusion on the analysis
of the evidence and all the Chief Executive did was to dismiss the whole
thing by saying well I know the man he  ' s honest

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#24:1:A>
<{> <[> And </[> I  ' m going to to uh uhm keep him even if he has
lost uh if even if the public in the public uh he has lost uh credibility

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X25:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X26:1:Z>
Now Howard why did you and the members of the Liberal Party all
vote against it </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#27:1:B>
Well we had been observing and taking interest in this issue
since this summer uh not just prime to the <{1> <[1> motion itself </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#28:1:B>
And uh during the whole <unc> one-word </unc> we did notice
that the university had its enquiry had to report

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#29:1:B>
And even at that time <,> uh the Liberal Party did not make any
hard statement one way or the other

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#30:1:B>
I mean uh I think as far Liberal Party is concern we would probably
uh took uh uh soften stance on the whole issue uh without making <?> rash
</?> statement on <,> uh you should do this or what I would do if I were the
Chief Executive crazy statements like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#31:1:B>
Uh so uh when the motion was debating in Legco last week it we
after consideration and taking account what we have thought since the summer

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#32:1:B>
And we thought that this was the well really uh it should uh be a
telling of a long <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#33:1:B>
And we felt that on <?> ons </?> uh enough was <unc> one-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#34:1:B>
Uh let things <?> rash </?> uh we uh did not support the move to
call on the Chief Executive <{2> <[2> fire </[2> one of his assistant <{3>
<[3> just </[3> because of this matter

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X35:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X36:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X37:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X38:1:Z>
Uhm Margaret you must have known even before the vote that you are
going to lose because <,> uh I think the Liberal Party the Democratic
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Progressive
Alliance <,> all made it known they would vote against it

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X39:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uh </[> but you uh persisted anyway

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X40:1:Z>
Do you feel that you achieve anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#41:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#42:1:A>
Well that  ' s why from the uh my answer to your first question was
it

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#43:1:A>
Perhaps it was uh an overdeveloped sense of duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#44:1:A>
It is just that when there is a very strong public feeling uh on a
very important issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#45:1:A>
I think it is not right just to let it uh drop just because I think
that I was not going to get the vote

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#46:1:A>
Uh the the uh Legco has a duty to <.> dis </.> discuss these things
to make sure that the public sentiment is reflected in the council

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#47:1:A>
And the I think it was uh uh a surprisingly keen debate I think I
counted besides myself and the Secretary for Civil Service are total of
twenty five Legco members who who  ' s spoken on the motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#48:1:A>
That means that even at this <?> state </?> there was a lot of
strong feelings about it and I don't think that you could just let the matter
drop because there are serious <{1> <[1> uh </[1> principle involved about
for example how we look at the the uh uh accountability of government whether
we accept that the the Chief Executive can <{2> <[2> do </[2> what he <{3>
<[3> likes </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X49:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X50:1:Z>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X51:1:Z>
<[3> Well </[3> </{3> uh you you mention <{1> <[1> strong </[1>
feeling but clearly this strong feeling is <.> mo </.> mostly uh on the other
side

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X52:1:Z>
They were not on your side because the you know your motion was
heavily uh defeated

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X53:1:Z>
Now you mention uh accountability I notice that the <unc>
one-word </unc> of the Executive Council uh C Y Leung had a letter to the
editor in the South China Morning Post on Saturday

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X54:1:Z>
Uh saying that when the Chief Executive talk about the
accountability he was talking about policy secretaries and directors of
bureaus <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and and and that you and and he thought you were
uh mistaken to uh use this issue in the uh Andrew Lo <{3> <[3> affair </[3>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#55:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#56:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#57:1:A>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3> no

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#58:1:A>
Uh I I think uh that is why my motion was not a motion of
non-confidence against uh Mr Andrew Lo because he  ' s not a policy <{1> <[1>
secretary </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#59:1:A>
Uh we thought that uh at least personally I thought that this is a
matter for the Chief Executive <{2> <[2> that  ' s </[2> why my motion call
upon the Chief Executive to terminate Mr Andrew Lo  ' s appointment as his
senior assistant

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#60:1:A>
Now what it what else it uh Mr Andrew Lo is supposed to do is not
a matter for me

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#61:1:A>
But when he has lost <.> cred </.> public credibility then it is
not right for <{3> <[3> the </[3> Chief Executive to keep this person in that
post that that was of the the focus of my motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#62:1:A>
I don't agree with you that the strong feeling was against me

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#63:1:A>
Because if you talk about Legco uh I think there was strong feeling
in favour of my motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#64:1:A>
But if you talk about the public I think overwhelmingly the public
was <.> als </.> also on my side

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#65:1:A>
Unfortunately they could not be tested the right way in Legco but
still that doesn't uh uh uh that that doesn't mean that we shouldn't discuss
it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X66:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X67:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X68:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X69:1:Z>
Howard do you think that Margaret has a point that Andrew Lo has
lost all credibility and therefore he cannot be effective anyway </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#70:1:B>
Well I think uh certainly judging from the report <,> of the
Hong Kong University uh enquiry <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#71:1:B>
Uh </[1> I would go as far as said that he <,> has probably lost
credibility in fact of those people on the enquiry otherwise they wouldn't
<,> make such uh <unc> one-word </unc> remarks

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#72:1:B>
But uhm we we look at uh Andrew Lo Lo  ' s uh function and job as
special <?> aim </?> to the Chief Executive as a whole

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#73:1:B>
I mean uh we and I believe many political part parties or
politicians in Hong Kong <{2> <[2> uhm </[2> they do have on <?> connotation
</?> to have contact with him either when you want to bring something to
attention of the Chief Executive or <,> <unc> one-word </unc> discuss
matter general

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#74:1:B>
Uhm it <,> I I <,> don't see how the Hong Kong University uh
<unc> one-word </unc> uh you know <,> directly in <unc> one-word
</unc> on all of the other functions at <{3> <[3> him </[3> <?> for </?>
<{4> <[4> so that  ' s <,> that  ' s for

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#75:1:B>
Well </[4> anyway uh uh I I like all his <unc> one-word
</unc> point <{5> <[5> uh Margaret </[5> explain that uh it was an
overwhelming sense of public duty that to raise the motion I would add but I
think every single member uhm <,> in Legco also shares an overwhelming sense
of public duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#76:1:B>
It everyone who sat there and voted and spoke <{6> <[6> or did
</[6> not spoke and we listen to other people who  ' s spoke

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#77:1:B>
And I think from the little party  ' s point of view we certainly
have no <,> personal reason or particularly reason to favour uhm Mr Lo or
yes or no

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#78:1:B>
But I uh we decide in the end of <unc> one-word </unc> that
we should not use uh Legco motion to <,> uh ask or put pressure on Chief <?>
Executive </?> tell him to fire one of his own staff

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#79:1:B>
I mean <,> what we uh think of the merits and demerits of the staff
might might be another person per and <,> uh but of course we we did not
choose to <unc> one-word </unc> that in <{6> <[6> public either </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X80:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X81:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X82:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#83:1:A>
<[4> Oh yeah I think I think so I I </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#84:1:A>
<[5> Yeah </[5> </{5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X85:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X86:1:Z>
<[6> Had have you </[6> </{6> had any dealings with uh Mr Lo you
you own personally </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#87:1:B>
Uh yes uh I first met Mr Lo in fact before the transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#88:1:B>
<{1> <[1> Uh </[1> uh that was in there is one I was member of the
preparatory committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#89:1:B>
<{2> <[2> Uh </[2> and the selection committee in fact uh uh on one
occasion I sat next to him <{3> <[3> at </[3> lunch

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#90:1:B>
And I have the time I recall uh I raise three topics with him and
ask uh one all all more or less tourism related topics

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#91:1:B>
One <?> ares </?> one was uh <?> allow </?> more Taiwanese visitors
to come to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#92:1:B>
One was uh tourism in Hong Kong and one was the high airport charge
in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#93:1:B>
And I said look if you can do anything to pass these concerns on
the Chief Executive and have haven't look into these matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#94:1:B>
It can only be good for the transition and uh in fact <{4> <[4> as
</[4> far as those issue and he <{5> <[5> he he he he </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X95:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X96:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X97:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X98:1:Z>
<[4> And </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X99:1:Z>
<[5> That impress you </[5> </{5> favourably </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#100:1:B>
Well uh he  ' s a very low key person I I did not I do not
known personally but I did had a at least uh one occasion to meet him

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#101:1:B>
He doesn't speak much he listens more than he speaks

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#102:1:B>
And of course whenever we see him we hope <{1> <[1> that </[1> he
would listen rather than <{2> <[2> speaks </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X103:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X104:1:Z>
<[2> I see </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X105:1:Z>
But do you have a favourable impression of him </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#106:1:B>
Uh <,,> it difficult to how it it he is not my staff

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#107:1:B>
I can only judge on one or two uh <{1> <[1> occasions </[1> uhm uh
I I I  ' m judging him I can only say that he is a very low key <{2> <[2>
person </[2> and I  ' m <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#108:1:B>
Honestly I have not heard him speak much I only observed him <{3>
<[3> listening </[3> and <{4> <[4> taking </[4> down notes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X109:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X110:1:Z>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X111:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X112:1:Z>
<[4> Right </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X113:1:Z>
<?> Now </?> Margaret have you had any dealings <{> <[> with </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#114:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> I have no dealing with Mr <{> <[> Andrew Lo

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#115:1:A>
Not </[> never met him no

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X116:1:Z>
<[> You never met him </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X117:1:Z>
Uhm so you you haven't formed any impression of uh him <{> <[>
personally </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#118:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{> I have no personal <?> ground </?> against
him

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#119:1:A>
I I either think that uh I I mean there was some I I don't know
one of of of the uh uh members said that uh I may have uh personal dislike of
him

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#120:1:A>
It  ' s uhm it is not a personal dislike at all

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#121:1:A>
But I think like other members of the public I have watched the uh
his evidence on camera

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#122:1:A>
I have since then uh ask for the excerpt <{1> <[1> that </[1> the
video tape of his evidence

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#123:1:A>
I  ' ve I have looked at the the record of his evidence

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#124:1:A>
I  ' ve checked that against the the report of the panel

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#125:1:A>
I think the panel  ' s judgment was extremely uh their comment was
extremely fair

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#126:1:A>
Uh and I think uh in fact a <?> various </?> a very <{2> <[2> mild
one </[2> but even this very mild one to be call a poor and <?> untrueful
</?> witness particularly <?> untrueful </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#127:1:A>
<{3> <[3> I giving </[3> evidence of of a <unc> one-word
</unc> version that  ' s a very <{4> <[4> serious matter </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#128:1:A>
Someone and I think the public was very concern about the fact
that someone appears to be going about to other people using uh what is the
personal authority of the Chief Executive

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#129:1:A>
Because in this line of of of uh uhm uh uhm dealings uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#130:1:A>
Obviously the Vice-Chancellor of the university thought that he
was a messenger from the Chief Executive whether he was <{5> <[5> express his
</[5> instruct or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#131:1:A>
<{6> <[6> So </[6> the public is concern about this personal use
of personal <{7> <[7> uh authority </[7>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X132:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X133:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X134:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X135:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X136:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X137:1:Z>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X138:1:Z>
<[7> Okay we  ' ll </[7> </{7> we  ' ll have to take a break <{> <[>
here </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X139:1:Z>
Don't go away we  ' ll right back <&> Commercial break </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X140:1:Z>
Welcome back

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X141:1:Z>
We  ' re talking about Andrew Lo the Chief Executive special
assistant

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X142:1:Z>
And uh Howard uh I understand that opinion surveys show that uh
majority of the public want to see Andrew Lo fired

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X143:1:Z>
Uh if that  ' s the case why is the Liberal Party against public
opinion </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#144:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#145:1:B>
Oh I knew we don't make up our minds on how to vote and what
to say in Legco base on <,> opinion surveys on one or two newspapers

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#146:1:B>
We try to look at the issue and also consider what uh <,> our
stance uh stance is uh on on this issue

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#147:1:B>
And what we regard is the best public uh interest

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#148:1:B>
Of course public opinion surveys is uh is is one thing that want
may to take to come but that is not the <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#149:1:B>
Uhm but I would like to add uh this point that uh since just
<unc> one-word </unc> of us here at least I have met the man on <,> I
would say at least two occasions

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#150:1:B>
And it was mention just now that uhm uhm whether he is a messenger
of the Chief Executive or not I I would <,> only add on the two occasions I
met him

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#151:1:B>
He hardly said anything uh it he him to me if he said he was a
messenger I would say he would probably more a message for us <{1> <[1> to
convey </[1> our views to the Chief Executive rather than the <{2> <[2> other
way </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#152:1:B>
But uh I uh I I I think uhm uh as for uhm his his own performance
uh in the enquiry I did watch some of the TV clips and <?> resum </?> the
stuff <{3> <[3> I </[3> I I would not <unc> one-word </unc> to add
that if if if if he would uh an actor he would certainly not win any Oscar
award and he  ' s sure that he  ' s not <{4> <[4> <unc> one-word </unc>
</[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X153:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#154:1:A>
<[2> I I <.> mis </.> </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X155:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X156:1:Z>
<[4> <unc> one-word </unc> </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#157:1:A>
<[4> I I  ' m talking about </[4> </{4> Oscar uh acting

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#158:1:A>
Uh my motion was very fairy and squarely on the loss of of uh
credibility in the pub uh before the <{1> <[1> public </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#159:1:A>
And uh uh it  ' s not only the surveys which was very strong on that
he should either be be dismissed or or should resign but also editorials I
think that that uh at least I counted at least two English and two Chinese
editorials I could have got more who all said that the man has lost public
credibility and the most uh uh appropriate thing to do is for him not to
serve in that post <{2> <[2> anymore </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X160:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X161:1:Z>
<[2> I </[2> </{2> I see that the Hong Kong government position
<{1> <[1> uh in </[1> in the uh debate uh was that uh Mr Lo has not
committed any substantial fault on interfere the university  ' s polling work

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X162:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> And </[2> uh being a poor and <?> untrueful </?>
witness it sound it  ' s not sufficient reason for <{3> <[3> him to be fired
</[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#163:1:A>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#164:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#165:1:B>
<[3> Yeah </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#166:1:A>
<[3> Exactly </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#167:1:A>
I mean that that is why it  ' s not my motion was not just on one
comment but on on public credibility

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#168:1:A>
And also I think it is uh uh the uh uhm the conclusion that he did
not interfere <{1> <[1> with academic </[1> freedom uh was not consistent
with either his evidence or the report of the panel

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#169:1:A>
Uh from the panel uh from the panel  ' s report he went on purpose
to see the the Vice-Chancellor

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#170:1:A>
He told him in advance that he was interested to discuss these uh
public survey polls

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#171:1:A>
Uh when he was there he questioned that the uh uh uh <,> the
conflict of interest of the <?> poster </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#172:1:A>
He asks the university who was responsible and told the university
that uh the university was in some way responsible

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#173:1:A>
I think these were <{2> <[2> very </[2> threatening remarks and
from the evidence of the Vice-Chancellor obviously it got to the Vice-
Chancellor

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#174:1:A>
Uh and so for these reasons I think it was very proper for the
public to feel very concern

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X175:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X176:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X177:1:Z>
Now Martin Lee is going to propose uh the Legco set up its own
investigation into the Andrew Lo matter

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X178:1:Z>
Uh Howard do you think uh that an investigation by Legco would
serve any purpose

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X179:1:Z>
Would the Liberal party support this </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#180:1:B>
Well uh uh yes I do understand that uh Mr Lee will raise a
motion uh we have not discuss our voting uh <,> uh and this it speech on the
motion as yet

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#181:1:B>
But I I believe the Liberal Party  ' s uh stance will be consistent
and uh I do not think we would have any U turns on <unc> one-word
</unc> on the matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#182:1:B>
Even during the summer <{1> <[1> uh we we had </[1> taken the
stance that uh let see what the Hong Kong University enquiry comes up with
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and what they said

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#183:1:B>
And then afterwards publish uh most of our members we when we
spoke to them not very formally but it  ' s <{3> <[3> <unc> one-word
</unc> your wind we thought it to be <unc> two-words </unc> </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X184:1:Z>
<[1> But it  ' s not a U turn </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X185:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X186:1:Z>
<[3> Well I I don't see how <,> uh I don't see how </[3> </{3>
gathering additional information

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X187:1:Z>
The supporting the gathering of <.> ad </.> additional
information is making a U turn

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X188:1:Z>
In if if uh enough information is new information is gathered you
may uh even <{1> <[1> just like that there is </[1> sufficient reason to
dismiss <{2> <[2> him </[2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#189:1:B>
<[1> I  ' m <unc> one-word </unc> what </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#190:1:B>
<[2> Well </[2> </{2> when when I  ' m saying that I  ' m making <?>
you </?> I was referring to fact that uh I did notice that during last week  ' s
debates uh there was some <unc> one-word </unc> not involving our
party but between two <{1> <[1> other </[1> parties

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#191:1:B>
One was accusing other some members having U turn <{2> <[2> what
</[2> they said

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#192:1:B>
<{3> <[3> But I think if you </[3> look through what Liberal Party
members up to this point in time have said uh I we have had not uh any
members <{4> <[4> calling for </[4> a formal select committee on this issue
<{5> <[5> <?> about </?> we have had we have </[5> had individual members
saying that <{6> <[6> well </[6> we think the <{7> <[7> the matter has </[7>
been clear that we should thought it was end there

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X193:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X194:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-031#195:1:A>
<[3> I I <?> stills </?> that  ' s </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#196:1:A>
<[4> I think I think the </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#197:1:A>
<[5> I think he is also uh uh </[5> </{5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X198:1:Z>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-031#X199:1:Z>
<[7> Yeah <unc> two-words </unc> </[7> </{7> </X> </I>
