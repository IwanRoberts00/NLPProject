<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#3:1>
THE right-wing Hongkong and Kowloon Trades Union Council has split
over a call from its president to abandon its anti-communist stance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#4:1>
Mr Chan Yun-che said the 33,000-strong council had to dilute its
political activities and spend more time on labour issues if it was to
survive beyond 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#5:1>
But some council members have called for his resignation ,
accusing him of breaching the council  ' s basic platform , which has
traditionally followed Taipei  ' s line . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#6:1>
Mr Chan hit back , saying it was the policy of Taiwan to seek
reconciliation with the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#7:1>
&ldquo; It is the right direction for the development of the
council to strengthen our work on labour issues .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#8:1>
We should reduce our role in politics , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#9:1>
Mr Lee Tak-ming , chairman of the Tung Wah Three Hospitals Workers  ' 
Union , said it was more constructive to spend time on labour issues . </p>

<bold> China gets tough over reform bid </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#12:2>
CHINA yesterday toughened its stance on Governor Mr Chris Patten  ' s
controversial electoral reform proposals and his call for a clear position on
the handover arrangements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#13:2>
Chinese Vice-premier Mr Qian Qichen yesterday said the job in
Hongkong now was to implement the agreements reached between China and
Britain , and not to launch political reforms . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#14:2>
&ldquo; There are only 49 months to go before China resumes
sovereignty .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#15:2>
The interests of the mainland are closely related to those of
Hongkong and stability and prosperity will create conditions for Hongkong ,
&rdquo; Mr Qian said , just days before the third round of the Sino-British
talks opens in Beijing on Friday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#16:2>
Mr Qian , who is also Chinese Foreign Minister , made the remarks
in a meeting with a delegation from the Hongkong West Kowloon All-Circles
Association . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#17:2>
A locally-based Chinese official , who asked not to be named ,
warned that it would be difficult for the third round of talks to yield
positive results if the British side continued to insist on the Patten
package as its opening position on the negotiating table . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#18:2>
&ldquo; The British claim that the Patten package is compatible
with the &lsquo; three accords &rsquo; has become the greatest obstacle in
the talks .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#19:2>
Such an important divergence over the basic principles has prevented
the talks from proceeding into discussion over details of the electoral
arrangements , &rdquo; the official said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#20:2>
He further criticised Mr Patten  ' s public remarks during his
recent visit to the United States , and said they had damaged the atmosphere
for the talks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#21:2>
&ldquo; Chris Patten  ' s attempt to play the through-train card
and the international card during his US visit was counter-productive to the
talks .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#22:2>
He just illustrated how insincere the British side was to the talks ,
&rdquo; the official said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#23:2>
The first two rounds of talks , held since April 22 , ended up
with both sides in deadlock over the understanding of the three accords
&dash; the Joint Declaration , convergence with the Basic Law and previous
understandings reached between the two Governments . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#24:2>
Refuting accusations that Beijing was attempting to stall the
talks beyond the Legislative Council  ' s July recess , the official said the
talks were dragging on because the British side refused to genuinely comply
with the three accords . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#25:2>
Another major stumbling block in the talks was understood to be
Britain  ' s demand that legislators elected in 1995 should stay in power
through the handover . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#26:2>
However , Mr Zhang Junsheng , vice-director of the local branch
of the New China News Agency , yesterday stressed that the regulations had
already been laid down . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#27:2>
&ldquo; Somebody has raised the question of the through train ,
but the Basic Law and the National People  ' s Congress resolution have clear
stipulations on the criteria for the through-train arrangements , &rdquo; he
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#28:2>
&ldquo; The subject of the talks is very clear .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#29:2>
According to the joint statement of the two Governments , the talks
will discuss the electoral arrangements in 1994/95 . &rdquo; </p> </I>

TWO Hongkong journalists from Television Broadcasts Limited
&obrack; TVB &cbrack; were taken away and interrogated by public security
officers when they tried to enter Beijing University on the night of June 3 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#33:3>
Attempts by other Hongkong journalists to cover the June 4
anniversary activities on Beijing campuses were aborted as security personnel
stepped up surveillance in the college district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#34:3>
The car carrying senior reporter Lee Tak-sing and his cameraman
was intercepted by public security guards on their way to Beijing University
in Haidian District . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#35:3>
Lee and his colleague were only released after they confessed to
the charge of illegal reporting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#36:3>
They were also interrogated by public security officers for more
than two hours at a nearby hotel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#37:3>
June Teng Wai-kwan , news controller of TVB , yesterday said the
atmosphere around the university campus in Beijing was very tense and it was
difficult for journalists to get into the university campus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#38:3>
Teng admitted it was not the first time TVB reporters had
attempted to break the news blackout . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#39:3>
&ldquo; From Hongkong  ' s point of view , the June 4 anniversary
is worth a news item .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#40:3>
We continued to send cameramen to film the situation on Tiananmen
Square this morning , &rdquo; she said . </p> </I>

CHINA could not define the requirements for through-train
legislators before the 1995 elections because doing so might spark off more
controversy and debate in the territory , according to Mr Xiang Chunyi ,
Vice-Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People  ' s Congress
&obrack; NPC &cbrack; Standing Committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#44:4>
Mr Xiang , a former Basic Law drafter , said the British demand
for objective criteria was unreasonable and stressed that an NPC resolution
had already addressed the question . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#45:4>
&ldquo; The through-train arrangements are a manifestation of the
handover of Hongkong  ' s sovereignty .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#46:4>
The NPC Standing Committee can't pre-empt the decisions of the SAR
Preparatory Committee just to serve the needs of the 1995 Legco elections ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#47:4>
&ldquo; It is technically infeasible to spell out a set of very
specific criteria before the 1995 elections to guarantee that particular
individuals must not be driven out of the through train in 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#48:4>
&ldquo; There will be a two-year gap between 1995 and 1997 , so
it will be inappropriate for the NPC Standing Committee to use the present
political conditions to formulate the criteria for the through-train
arrangements in 1997 , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#49:4>
&ldquo; There may be unprecedented changes between 1995 and 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#50:4>
How can the NPC Standing Committee formulate the criteria before the
1995 Legco elections ? &rdquo; he asked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#51:4>
Mr Xiang said that even if detailed criteria were required to
clarify the through-train arrangements , these criteria must be formulated by
the SAR Preparatory Committee which would be set up in 1996 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#52:4>
&ldquo; If specific criteria for the through-train arrangements
are set out before the formation of the SAR Preparatory Committee , then the
committee will be reduced to a rubber-stamp , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#53:4>
&ldquo; By doing so , we will show a lack of respect to the 50
per cent Hongkong members sitting on the committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#54:4>
&ldquo; Any specific criteria and detailed regulations governing
the through-train procedures should be set out by the SAR Preparatory
Committee , not the NPC Standing Committee . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#55:4>
Mr Xiang warned that formulation of a set of very detailed and
specific criteria would spark off greater controversy in Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#56:4>
&ldquo; If we set a criteria forbidding anybody taking part in
subversive organisations to sit on the through train , then the definition of
subversive organisations will spark off controversy and debate in Hongkong ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#57:4>
&ldquo; People will query whether the definition of subversive
organisations should stick to the definition in the Hongkong laws or Chinese
laws , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#58:4>
But the legal expert said people who had committed mistakes in
the past would be allowed to sit on the through train if they corrected their
mistakes in 1997 . </p> </I>

CHINA  ' s top official in charge of Hongkong affairs , Mr Lu Ping
, yesterday reaffirmed Beijing  ' s support for the controversial Chek Lap Kok
airport project on condition that the British Government upheld the
Memorandum of Understanding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#62:5>
After meeting the sub-group of Hongkong and Macau deputies to the
National People  ' s Congress , Mr Lu , director of the State Council  ' s
Hongkong and Macau Affairs Office , said the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
&obrack; JLG &cbrack; should hold meetings because a large number of issues
had not yet been resolved . </p> <O> photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#63:5>
Mr Lu  ' s remarks were understood to be Beijing  ' s latest
reassurance to calm widespread speculation about an imminent total breakup in
Sino-British co-operation over Hongkong  ' s transitional arrangements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#64:5>
Mr Lu declined to elaborate on when JLG talks could resume . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#65:5>
Governor Mr Chris Patten  ' s spokesman , Mr Mike Hanson ,
yesterday urged China to name a date for further talks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#66:5>
On the prospects for the long-stalled new airport project , Mr Lu
said the Chinese Government still hoped it would be completed by 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#67:5>
&ldquo; If the British side upholds the Memorandum of
Understanding , the Chinese Government will support the construction of the
new airport , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#68:5>
However , Mr Lu told the Hongkong and Macau NPC deputies at the
closed-door meeting that it was unlikely the Chek Lap Kok airport would be
completed before 1997 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#69:5>
Meanwhile , the deputy director of the Hongkong branch of the New
China News Agency , Mr Zhang Junsheng , lambasted Mr Patten for sacrificing
the interests of Hongkong people in exchange for his own political career .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#70:5>
&ldquo; If he tables the bill for electoral reform in the
Legislative Council for discussion , it will be the third mistaken step he
has taken on the road of wrong-doings , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#71:5>
&ldquo; I hope he will not cling obstinately to his course , or
make use of the interests of the people of Hongkong and Britain as a stake
for his political career . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#72:5>
Meanwhile , the Sino-British diplomatic impasse has not
substantially damaged the economic co-operation between the two countries ,
with high-level official contact in the financial sector continuing as normal .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#73:5>
The governor-designate of the Bank of England , Mr Eddie George ,
arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a 10-day visit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#74:5>
Mr George yesterday held a meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier Mr
Zhu Rongji to discuss Sino-British economic relations and co-operation
between the Bank of England and the People  ' s Bank of China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#75:5>
Mr George is today scheduled to meet Minister of Finance Mr Liu
Zhongli , the president of the Bank of China , Mr Wang Deyan , a
vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade , and a
vice-chairman of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#76:5>
Mr George  ' s trip to China was in reciprocation for a visit by Mr
Li Guixian , governor of the People  ' s Bank of China , to London last June .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#77:5>
When asked about the impact of the Sino-British row on the
economic relations between the two countries , Mr Li , who is also a State
Councillor , said : &ldquo; Economics is economics , business should carry on .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#78:5>
The deputy governor of the People  ' s Bank of China , Mr Chen Yuan
, said : &ldquo; At the micro-economic level , bilateral trade link is a
long-term relation .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#79:5>
It should not be affected by political issues . &rdquo; </p> </I>

ARRANGEMENTS for the body which will set up the Special
Administrative Region Preparatory Committee are expected to be discussed by
the National People  ' s Congress &obrack; NPC &cbrack; Standing Committee
later this month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#83:6>
Chinese sources yesterday said the Standing Committee was
planning to hold its first discussion on the body &dash; known as a work
organ &dash; since its establishment was approved by the NPC plenary session
in March . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#84:6>
However , they said the body would not be set up by the end of
this month because China wanted to wait for the end of Sino-British talks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#85:6>
&ldquo; The NPC Standing Committee meeting this month will
discuss arrangements to prepare for the setting up of the working organ and
set up some important guidelines about the preparatory work , &rdquo; sources
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#86:6>
Standing Committee member and vice-chairman of the NPC  ' s Law
Committee , Xiang Chunyi , said the committee  ' s bimonthly meeting would be

CHINA yesterday accused the British side of &ldquo; playing
little tricks &rdquo; and undermining the forth round of talks on Hongkong  ' s
political development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#91:7>
It is understood the Chinese side was opposed to the adoption of
the Boundary and Election Commission Bill by the Legislative Council on
Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#92:7>
Chinese sources said Beijing considered it vital for Britain to
show sufficient sincerity when the talks were going towards concrete issues
of the electoral arrangements in 1994/95 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#93:7>
&ldquo; The Boundary and Election Commission Bill is a part of
the legislation for the 1994/95 electoral arrangements, &rdquo; sources said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#94:7>
&ldquo; The British side has played little tricks to push through
the bill at Legco just before the fourth round of talks .

<ICE-HK:W2C-009#95:7>
It is playing the time pressure tactics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#96:7>
&ldquo; The Chinese side is disappointed that although we have
taken various initiatives to create a favourable atmosphere for the talks ,
the British side still shows a lack of sincerity in co-operating with us,
&rdquo; sources said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#97:7>
Chinese and British negotiators held a three-hours session in
Villa No 10 of the Diaoyutai Guesthouse yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#98:7>
Speaking after the morning session , Sir Robin McLaren , British
negotiator team leader and Ambassador to China , refused to describe the
atmosphere of the talks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#99:7>
During the third round last week , he described the atmosphere as
&ldquo; good &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#100:7>
Sir Robin said only that the two sides had discussed a range of
topics , but refused to disclose any further details . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#101:7>
He said he was looking forward to continuing discussions at a
fifth round . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#102:7>
Both Mr Jiang Enzhu , China  ' s chief negotiator and Vice-Foreign
Minister , and Sir Robin appeared restrained yesterday morning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#103:7>
Mr Jiang refused to make any comment on the forth round of talks
, saying that the China  ' s position was consistent and clear . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#104:7>
&ldquo; I don't think I have anything to add except to say there
has been rather a short gap between the last round and this round, &rdquo;
Sir Robin said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#105:7>
Mr Jiang said , &ldquo; Progress in the talks requires both
sides to show sincerity and to work hard together. &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-009#106:7>
Sir Robin said the adoption of the Boundary and Election
Commission Bill should not adversely affect the talks . </p> </I>
