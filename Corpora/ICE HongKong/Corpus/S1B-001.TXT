On page one five six you have the change of Frances after the
death of the first mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#2:1:A>
And I want you to find a few adjectives that describe the dominant
feeling after the death of the mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#3:1:A>
And also I want you to find the role of Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#4:1:A>
What kind of role did she play in the development of relationship
between Frances and Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#5:1:A>
So on one five seven and one five eight you have a conversation <,>
namely between Frances and Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#6:1:A>
So where is Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#7:1:A>
And why is she present in this conversation

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#8:1:A>
In fact it is it  ' s a kind of flirting

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#9:1:A>
The the boy flirt with the girl

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#10:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#11:1:A>
So I give a few minute and you give me the answers <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#12:1:A>
So you may have a record if everybody  ' s voice

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#13:1:A>
So on page one five six you have the death of the first mole and
then the immediate change of feelings anyone <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#14:1:A>
<quote> So that she is a repeated </quote>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X15:1:Z>
Indifference </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#16:1:A>
Indifference

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#17:1:A>
Dominant right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#18:1:A>
Indifference

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#19:1:A>
And she just doesn't care anymore

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#20:1:A>
Doesn't care

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#21:1:A>
Indifferent

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#22:1:A>
So you have indifference three times right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#23:1:A>
Anymore

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X24:1:Z>
Calm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#25:1:A>
Calm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#26:1:A>
How many times

<$Z3> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X27:1:Z>
Twice </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#28:1:A>
Twice okay two times

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#29:1:A>
<quote> Frances suddenly became calm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#30:1:A>
And then calm indifference overlying her quiet sadness </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#31:1:A>
So calm indifferent and sad

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#32:1:A>
Sad is also repeated but with a synonym

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#33:1:A>
Which word also mean sad

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#34:1:A>
Grief right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#35:1:A>
So first is feel breathless feel sad and then become calm and then
indifferent

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#36:1:A>
And then <,,> after being indifferent she doesn't care about
anything

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#37:1:A>
She doesn't care about Jimmy anymore

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#38:1:A>
And she feel

<$Z4> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X39:1:Z>
Isolated </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#40:1:A>
Isolated

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#41:1:A>
Right isolation

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#42:1:A>
But there is certain kind of pressure in this kind of isolation

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#43:1:A>
So you have the word

<$Z5> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X44:1:Z>
Pride </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#45:1:A>
Pride

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#46:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#47:1:A>
Become proud

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#48:1:A>
Pride

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#49:1:A>
So she takes pride in her isolation and indifference

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#50:1:A>
And then <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#51:1:A>
Second last paragraph <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#52:1:A>
So something that echo pride

<$Z6> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X53:1:Z>
Dignity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#54:1:A>
Dignity

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#55:1:A>
<quote> So uhm she dress in white muslin and walked with dignity
</quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#56:1:A>
Detach

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#57:1:A>
This word also echo indifference right detach aloof

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#58:1:A>
A L O O F aloof

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#59:1:A>
And one important word is forgetful <quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#60:1:A>
I don't mind Jimmy nearly another woman

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#61:1:A>
I don't mind it </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#62:1:A>
And this man only affected her slightly

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#63:1:A>
So the pain the irritation the sadness caused by Jimmy is gone
almost gone

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#64:1:A>
And this is the process of <quote> Frances suddenly became calm in
that moment </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#65:1:A>
Key word page one five six

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#66:1:A>
Grow up

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#67:1:A>
Right in that moment grown up

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#68:1:A>
So this <,> well to a certain extent explain the philosophy of
Lawrence in the story

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#69:1:A>
Life is made up of crisis

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#70:1:A>
A lot of crisis in one night

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#71:1:A>
And after each crisis you may experience the period of sadness

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#72:1:A>
And in that sadness one dies

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#73:1:A>
So on page one five six many of you have underlined <quote>
something had died in her </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#74:1:A>
Something died

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#75:1:A>
Maybe love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#76:1:A>
Maybe Jimmy

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#77:1:A>
Maybe all the troubles

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#78:1:A>
All the pain that is caused by the first love by Jimmy okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#79:1:A>
And this die <,> and afterwards a person is reborn

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#80:1:A>
So if you frustrated and then you feel a kind of renewal you become
confident again

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#81:1:A>
You try again

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#82:1:A>
So uhm this is one theme

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#83:1:A>
The theme of love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#84:1:A>
Frances in one  ' s life

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#85:1:A>
And after the mole die Frances looked at it from a different angle

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#86:1:A>
And she start to see thing in new light

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#87:1:A>
And the first person she feels that she had ignored so far is <,>
the first not not Tom yet

<$Z7> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X88:1:Z>
Anne </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#89:1:A>
In the middle of that page <quote> why did she care so little
for Anne who was fond of her she asked herself why did she care so little for
anyone

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#90:1:A>
<quote> So first she looked at Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#91:1:A>
Maybe I should devote my love to my sister

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#92:1:A>
My sister is a very good friend for me

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#93:1:A>
But so far I devote all my love to by boyfriend Jimmy <,> who
doesn't really deserve my love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#94:1:A>
So she tried to distract herself divert her attention to Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#95:1:A>
The immediate person <,> in front of her </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#96:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#97:1:A>
And then expend this philosophy <&> bell rings </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#98:1:A>
<quote> Why will she care so little for anyone

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#99:1:A>
Maybe many people in the surroundings worth my attention and love
</quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#100:1:A>
Then this expand to Tom <unc> one-word </unc> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#101:1:A>
So he paid uh she paid more attention to Tom afterwards

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#102:1:A>
<quote> She start to notice the unnoticeable in the past </quote>
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#103:1:A>
And one five seven to one five none you can see a new start for
Frances and Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#104:1:A>
Do you find a new Frances <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#105:1:A>
No idea

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#106:1:A>
New Frances <,,>

<$Z8> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X107:1:Z>
She is reborn </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#108:1:A>
She is reborn and any new attitude different from the past
<,,>

<$Z9> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X109:1:Z>
She begins to accept Tom </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#110:1:A>
Yes she begins to accept Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#111:1:A>
Now the acceptance of Tom is active or passive <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#112:1:A>
Active or passive

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#113:1:A>
Active because you the word <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#114:1:A>
Second paragraph of one five seven the <{> <[> last </[> sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#115:1:A>
Advance yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#116:1:A>
Very aggressive

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#117:1:A>
Now uhm the paragraph Tom was a medium stature that paragraph you
can see that <quote> the attraction of Frances to Tom is haunted </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#118:1:A>
So Tom has been fond of Frances for a long long time <,> but he
hasn't got the confidence to court <,> to flirt with her

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#119:1:A>
And top of one five seven <quote> Frances was aware delicate kind
of feeling and there is a kind of clear delicious stimulation he explains
</quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#120:1:A>
So again delicious

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#121:1:A>
So the yearning for Frances is constant

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#122:1:A>
So the next paragraph you can see that <quote> Frances now know
that the best is gone

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#123:1:A>
And she  ' s going to take the second best </quote> <quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#124:1:A>
And this is her own decision

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#125:1:A>
And once she made up his mind uh her mind she advance rather
indifferently </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#126:1:A>
The word advance means an active pursuit

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#127:1:A>
Active pursuit of second best

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#128:1:A>
So this is new

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#129:1:A>
Advances toward Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#130:1:A>
The new target maybe

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#131:1:A>
Anything that suggests you have a new Frances

<$Z10> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X132:1:Z>
<[> Advance </[> </{> </X>

<$Z11> <X> <quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X133:1:Z>
She laugh

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X134:1:Z>
She always laugh </quote> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#135:1:A>
<quote> She always laugh

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#136:1:A>
The trouble is over so she always laugh

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#137:1:A>
She laugh gaily sometimes </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#138:1:A>
Anything else

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#139:1:A>
How about her trip to Liverpool <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#140:1:A>
<quote> So this Frances standing Tom is not the Frances that was
in the history </quote>

<$Z12> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X141:1:Z>
She is still in Liverpool </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#142:1:A>
Yes so when uhm <quote> Tom asked her you are back no I  ' m
still in Liverpool

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#143:1:A>
This is a new land

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#144:1:A>
The old Frances die when Jimmy married another woman </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#145:1:A>
So here you have the new Frances because uhm she  ' s been she has
reborn after the death of the first mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#146:1:A>
The death of all the dead feelings okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#147:1:A>
And also you can Frances is flirting

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#148:1:A>
F L I R T I N G

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#149:1:A>
Flirt

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#150:1:A>
<quote> Is flirting with Tom and giving him some hints of intimacy

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#151:1:A>
They have undertone of intimacy linked him firm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#152:1:A>
And seems that Tom takes the hint

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#153:1:A>
Tom said this isn't you

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#154:1:A>
Her heart lifted in approval </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#155:1:A>
And here you can see she is starting to look at the good side of
Tom okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#156:1:A>
And find Tom is rather attractive

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#157:1:A>
<quote> She likes him his faint way his humour his ignorance

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#158:1:A>
His slow masculinity </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#159:1:A>
So the first two is okay but ignorance is it a kind of attraction

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#160:1:A>
May not be

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#161:1:A>
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#162:1:A>
And so masculinity

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#163:1:A>
You know past this maybe the weak points of Tom but now she accept

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#164:1:A>
Accept it all

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#165:1:A>
How about the language of Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#166:1:A>
Do they find faults with his language

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#167:1:A>
Do they I mean Frances and Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#168:1:A>
Yes who find fault with Tom  ' s language

<$Z13> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X169:1:Z>
Anne </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#170:1:A>
Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#171:1:A>
Anne said

<$Z14> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X172:1:Z>
Such language </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#173:1:A>
<quote> Such language scold him sharply </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#174:1:A>
So Tom is a close friend of Anne but they are not uhm lovers

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#175:1:A>
Okay so Anne  ' s criticism of Tom is consistent

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#176:1:A>
Anne doesn't like his language

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#177:1:A>
<quote> Such language and she scolded him </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#178:1:A>
How about Frances

<$Z15> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X179:1:Z>
Did not matter to her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#180:1:A>
It does not matter to her because she

<$Z16> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X181:1:Z>
Accept it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#182:1:A>
Accept it and she did not care

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#183:1:A>
<quote> Get Indifferent did not care the vulgar speech will make
him make her unhappy as a groom </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#184:1:A>
Because jimmy was always a gentleman but you to change attitude

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#185:1:A>
And Frances really do uh does not mind about the manner of speech

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#186:1:A>
Over the page <,> any flirting between Tom and uhm Frances <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#187:1:A>
Anymore flirting <,,>

<$Z17> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X188:1:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#189:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z17> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X190:1:Z>
Uh <quote> France did not bother </quote> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#191:1:A>
Where

<$Z17> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X192:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#193:1:A>
<quote> I could if it was necessary </quote> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#194:1:A>
Okay so you have flirting when they discuss the mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#195:1:A>
Talking about whether Frances will not knock them dead or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#196:1:A>
So Frances said <quote> I could I could be very cruel if it was
necessary

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#197:1:A>
And he was sole to feel her difference </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#198:1:A>
So this also show that you have the new Frances but Tom is rather
slow maybe rather stupid right to see Frances is very <,> uhm friendly to him
like try to talk with him in some uhm friendly way

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#199:1:A>
And when they talk about the mole well in fact they are trying to
make a fuss of killing moles

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#200:1:A>
And sometime you feel lovers talk nonsense right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#201:1:A>
They talk nonsense

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#202:1:A>
And they drag on and on about whether it  ' s necessary to kill the
mole or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#203:1:A>
And this is also a kind of flirting

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#204:1:A>
And they dragged on

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#205:1:A>
<quote> And Frances said if it  ' s necessary for me for me to kill
mole that  ' s quite true now in a shaky fashion I know it is it is necessary
for me to kill one

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#206:1:A>
Would you like to kill one she said

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#207:1:A>
They do us a lot of damage

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#208:1:A>
This is a fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#209:1:A>
Anne mentioned that before

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#210:1:A>
Moles <unc> one-word </unc> about the damage

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#211:1:A>
I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#212:1:A>
The next time I come across one they  ' re aren't <unc> one-word
</unc> </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#213:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#214:1:A>
<quote> And to say before him her pride troubled </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#215:1:A>
Nah <quote> immediately after the death of the first mole Frances
forget him and become a very proud woman </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#216:1:A>
Right so trying to put put up a very dignified posture so that uhm
it become attractive but cold towards other men

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#217:1:A>
But now Tom become rather attractive to her

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#218:1:A>
And while she talked with Tom she find that he has a good sense of
humour

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#219:1:A>
<quote> He  ' s quite pleasant

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#220:1:A>
It  ' s quite pleasant to talk with Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#221:1:A>
And she is attracted fascinated therefore her pride troubled

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#222:1:A>
He find uneasy and <unc> two words </unc> victory his
<unc> a few words </unc> and baffled

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#223:1:A>
Fate had written </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#224:1:A>
So here you have the kind of mutual attraction

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#225:1:A>
So uhm in the discussion about the mole it is also uh a kind of
flirting

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#226:1:A>
They tried to tease one another

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#227:1:A>
T A S uh T E A S E try to tease one another

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#228:1:A>
And Anne Anne is the odd man out

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#229:1:A>
Like the third party the odd man out

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#230:1:A>
<quote> Anne said I don't know what you two been enjoying about I  ' m
sure </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#231:1:A>
So here <,> Anne shows her ignorance of the love talk between
lovers

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#232:1:A>
This shows that Anne is totally inexperienced in romance <,> and
Anne is too young <,,> that  ' s why she is totally ignorant and she can't
understand the love talk

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#233:1:A>
But Anne has been a very clear-headed observer <,> from the
beginning to the end right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#234:1:A>
So Anne said <quote> well I think Tom certainly is a good deal
better to my thinking than Jimmy and nicer </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#235:1:A>
So this is a very objective criticism <.> ob </.> objective
comment <,> for the reference of Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#236:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#237:1:A>
And well another incidence of flirting is <,> talking nicely

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#238:1:A>
The top of one five eight

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#239:1:A>
<quote> I should have to have a try he said

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#240:1:A>
What

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#241:1:A>
To talk nicely

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#242:1:A>
Frances coloured </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#243:1:A>
Coloured blush okay blush <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#244:1:A>
And then why does Frances kill the second mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#245:1:A>
After the persistence hunt okay not by chance so why she has to
hunt for more and then killed it and then take it to show Tom

<$Z18> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X246:1:Z>
To show her <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X247:1:Z>
She totally forget <unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#248:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#249:1:A>
So maybe this time she is going to kill Jimmy with with her own
hands

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#250:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#251:1:A>
Make him dead and then show Tom so I  ' m determined

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#252:1:A>
And also <,,> Tom said the moles do a lot of damage

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#253:1:A>
And Frances still want to show him

<$Z19> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X254:1:Z>
To show that she can do something <unc> two words </unc>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#255:1:A>
Yes she could do something for him okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#256:1:A>
So she agrees with him and she can do something for him

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#257:1:A>
And they can do something together

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#258:1:A>
They are standing on the same side

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#259:1:A>
The side with him

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#260:1:A>
So this is a a and also an action of identification

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#261:1:A>
<quote> I an I identify myself with you </quote> okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#262:1:A>
Now uhm after the death of the first mole you have <quote>
something had died in her </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#263:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#264:1:A>
It seems that Frances died with the mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#265:1:A>
And here after the death of the second mole the last line of the
story <quote> here  ' s in the dead voice there was a thrill of passion in this
in this death </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#266:1:A>
So it seems that Frances also experienced another kind of death
with the death of the second mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#267:1:A>
And here it is and you know an an invitation of going out together

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#268:1:A>
So how do you feel about the ending <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#269:1:A>
Is the invitation accepted

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#270:1:A>
Accepted by Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#271:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#272:1:A>
So what is your opinion

<$Z20> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X273:1:Z>
Frances has start a new life <,> new life </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#274:1:A>
Start a new life

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#275:1:A>
So you have a <quote> strange little love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#276:1:A>
She put her hand into his arm </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#277:1:A>
Is not the boy that take her hand

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#278:1:A>
She put her own hand in in his arms

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#279:1:A>
Just like she advance indifferently very active

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#280:1:A>
So do you like the ending <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#281:1:A>
Why not change it into uhm yes she replies in a new voice <,> with
a thrill of pleasure of this new stance <,> in in stead of saying it  ' s a
dead voice

<$Z21> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X282:1:Z>
<unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#283:1:A>
Dead is the style of Lawrence

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#284:1:A>
Not really

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#285:1:A>
Not that sad

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#286:1:A>
He can see people dying in his story <,> but not really the style
of Lawrence

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#287:1:A>
It may reflect the kind of philosophy of Lawrence but not really
his usual style

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#288:1:A>
Do you like the new Frances <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#289:1:A>
Some say no

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#290:1:A>
Okay why do you like the new Frances

<$Z22> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X291:1:Z>
Because <unc> a few words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#292:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z22> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X293:1:Z>
It  ' s hard to do so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#294:1:A>
It  ' s hard to do so

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#295:1:A>
But she did it

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#296:1:A>
Okay it  ' s great

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#297:1:A>
And some of you shake your head <,,> uh why

<$Z23> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X298:1:Z>
Something she may also <unc> two words </unc> Tom </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#299:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#300:1:A>
So you feel that this Frances may maybe <,> a heartless Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#301:1:A>
Heartless

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#302:1:A>
So she can forget the first love so easily <,> maybe she can
forget the second best even more easily

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#303:1:A>
Do you feel so

<$Z24> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X304:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#305:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#306:1:A>
So that  ' s why you have <quote> the dead voice the the pleasure of
this dead </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#307:1:A>
Nah for for Frances okay I don't mind because Jimmy had already
married another man

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#308:1:A>
Why not I try the second best

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#309:1:A>
I have nothing to lose

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#310:1:A>
I don't care

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#311:1:A>
So what characterise Frances ' indifference

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#312:1:A>
<quote> Even when she advance that she advances towards Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#313:1:A>
She advances indifferently

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#314:1:A>
May be let  ' s have some fun together </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#315:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#316:1:A>
But of course uhm some people said uhm they don't want to get
married

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#317:1:A>
They want to have love for love sake

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#318:1:A>
They enjoy the feeling of falling in love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#319:1:A>
But if a person fall in love too many times maybe that kind of
love is not real love

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#320:1:A>
So you may have this feeling of Frances because dead and death
shows that Frances is less spontaneous less humoured than before

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#321:1:A>
Do you feel that

<$Z25> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#X322:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#323:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#324:1:A>
So maybe Frances become reckless become unrelentless in love
</quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#325:1:A>
And as for your argument right you you mean argument about the
style of uh D H Lawrence

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#326:1:A>
Now death is not his style

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#327:1:A>
But his philosophy is that if you lose spontaneity <,> if you lose
natural genuine feelings than you are like the living dead

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#328:1:A>
Okay you are like the dead person

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#329:1:A>
So in this <.> an </.> in this sense all right from this angle you
are right

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#330:1:A>
This echo his philosophy

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#331:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#332:1:A>
So uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#333:1:A>
The ending is a bit gloomy in fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#334:1:A>
Even though you have a new start even though you have activities
promised by this invitation of Tom

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#335:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#336:1:A>
They are going out

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#337:1:A>
They are going to have fun

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#338:1:A>
They are going to parties

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#339:1:A>
But the loss of feeling is pathetic

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#340:1:A>
It  ' s sad <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#341:1:A>
And you have one outsider

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#342:1:A>
That is Anne

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#343:1:A>
To stand as a contrast to Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#344:1:A>
And also to stand as an yardstick <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#345:1:A>
So you know a yardstick to measure something okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#346:1:A>
So Anne is consistent from the beginning to the end

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#347:1:A>
Because Anne is emotionally undisturbed <,> unaffected

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#348:1:A>
So from the beginning to the end uhm Anne uh the teenage girl is
cleared-headed

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#349:1:A>
<quote> She is unaffected by emotional matters

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#350:1:A>
What concerned this girl is eating and playing and have fun
</quote> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#351:1:A>
<quote> Anne  ' s action is very daring <,> forward </quote> okay
forward so uhm when the mole bite her hand so Anne just knocked it down in
one blow very forward straight forward decisive

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#352:1:A>
And she is able to analyse the situation very calmly

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#353:1:A>
So uhm <quote> Jimmy would like to marry her because Jimmy got a
degree </quote> something like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#354:1:A>
And uhm <quote> Tom is a good deal better than Jimmy </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#355:1:A>
So also clear-headed analysis

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#356:1:A>
<quote> But she has her own limitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#357:1:A>
She doesn't understand the word of Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#358:1:A>
And she doesn't understand the love talk </quote> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#359:1:A>
And she stay consistent in the story

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#360:1:A>
Right her opinion is consistent from beginning to the end

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#361:1:A>
And this reflect the inconsistency of Frances

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#362:1:A>
<quote> Her views her feelings towards Tom changes drastically
after the failure of her first love </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#363:1:A>
And Frances is also disturbed <?> hesitated </?> when she is
troubled by Jimmy at the beginning of the story

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#364:1:A>
So <.> sh </.> uh so she is very hesitate when she see the mole

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#365:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#366:1:A>
She doesn't want to kill it

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#367:1:A>
But near the end Frances become very decisive reckless and
sometime if you use the word indifferent it it means that she become
unfeeling

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#368:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#369:1:A>
So of course uhm this is a change for the worse

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#370:1:A>
It  ' s not a change for the better

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#371:1:A>
And one other theme that I  ' ve mentioned is it the <,> the crisis
in growth <,> growing up

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#372:1:A>
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#373:1:A>
The cycle of death and rebirth

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#374:1:A>
If you don't like the word to rebirth you can have renewal </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-001#375:2:A>
Try to look at those four lines and see <,> what is the
effect of this words in those four lines

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#376:2:A>
Uh give yourself say four lines

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#377:2:A>
And the next one is <,> think of fire and ice <,> as compared to
ice and desire

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#378:2:A>
So in the earlier part we  ' ve got fire and then ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#379:2:A>
In our second part we  ' ve got ice and desire

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#380:2:A>
Now think about those two groups of words

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#381:2:A>
Just write down what you think

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#382:2:A>
They are used I mean uh why they are used like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#383:2:A>
And the last one <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#384:2:A>
The last point is actually a comparison of the two sections

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#385:2:A>
Uhm in the first part <,> in the first part uhm try to find out
how much you react to the words

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#386:2:A>
So in the first section you given an example of fire and the
second question about ice

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#387:2:A>
So you have written a sentence

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#388:2:A>
In this last point I would like you to compare what you have
written

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#389:2:A>
For example someone said uh fire is a flame with yellow and red
colour

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#390:2:A>
And then we have the uhm <quote> what is a youth

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#391:2:A>
Impetuous fire </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#392:2:A>
So compare those two

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#393:2:A>
Do you understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#394:2:A>
Now uh I still have some more to say

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#395:2:A>
Please don't move you  ' ve been late for this lesson

<ICE-HK:S1B-001#396:2:A>
And you have to stay on for another ten ten minutes </I>
