<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X40:1:Z>
So I have to be studying because I  ' ve got only two weeks more and
last few days I haven't been doing anything but just uh going out with my
friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X41:1:Z>
So from next week I  ' m hoping to make a time table sit down and do
some work

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X42:1:Z>

we are hoping to probably go to Macau

Uh about five or six I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X51:1:Z>
Haven't still decided

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X52:1:Z>
Because most of my friends are going back to their own countries
uh because most of my friends are overseas students and all of them are going
back to their countries during the holiday

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X53:1:Z>
So the people who are left here will go to Macau with us </X>

holiday <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and so and so forth

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X218:1:Z>
There  ' s a place called Club Sri Lanka which we went to

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X219:1:Z>
And actually one thing I didn't like the food there at that time
because it was vegetarian and I wanted some chicken or some kind of meat

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X220:1:Z>
So and I wasn't I didn't have a big appetite to eat so I was like
thinking ah I should have eaten some more because my friend he really really
like the food you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X221:1:Z>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X231:1:Z>
Uh I  ' m not too sure whether you know my friend

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X232:1:Z>
He  ' s just a friend

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X233:1:Z>
He is just a good friend that is

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X234:1:Z>
The best of friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X235:1:Z>
And nothing more than that

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X236:1:Z>
Okay Alice

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X237:1:Z>
Are you satisfied </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#238:1:A>
Yeah very satisfactory

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X239:1:Z>
Anyway he ate a lot

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X240:1:Z>
He was able to like really eat and after he could hardly walk

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X241:1:Z>
You know because he was supposed to go shopping

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X242:1:Z>
He was supposed to go shopping

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X243:1:Z>
Yet about five minutes he said ah he can't hardly walk because he
ate so much </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#244:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#245:1:A>
How much was it for one person

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X246:1:Z>
Uh seventy </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#247:1:A>
Seventy

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X248:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#249:1:A>
Uh uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#250:1:A>
That  ' s very reasonable

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#251:1:A>
Yeah I may go some time

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X252:1:Z>
Yeah actually the food is not is not very hot

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X253:1:Z>
It  ' s not very spicy because most are the Chinese and foreigners
go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X254:1:Z>
Because back in Sri Lanka we eat a lot of spicy food but here
because of the other foreigners who come there and they don't make it very
spicy

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X255:1:Z>
So the day when I went the my friend eats <.> spic </.> spicy
food so they put more chillies for us </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#256:1:A>
Do you think the cook are from are from <.> Sri </.> Sri
Lanka

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X257:1:Z>
I think so because I was able to speak to one person in
Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X258:1:Z>
I spoke I spoke to that person in Singhalese after lunch because
I haven't spoken to anyone in Hong Kong in Singhalese except for some of my
family friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X259:1:Z>
So it was nice speaking to someone in my own language </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#260:1:A>
I I would like to learn Singhalese some time

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#261:1:A>
I think it  ' s very interesting you know to learn uhm another
language

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#262:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Yeah </[1> yeah I I think I have got talent <&> laughter
</&> <{2> <{2> in this area </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#263:1:A>
Well <.> wh </.> what about how how can you say uhm breakfast in
<.> S </.> Singhalese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X264:1:Z>
<[1> Yah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X265:1:Z>
<[2> Wow </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X266:1:Z>
Uhm hold on just let me recall my <{> <[> Singhalese </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#267:1:A>
<[> What </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#268:1:A>
What

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#269:1:A>
Pardon

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X270:1:Z>
</{> Okay I must be telling you now uh my Singhalese is I can't
say is very good because I haven't spoken in Singhalese for some time

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X271:1:Z>
And even when I go home I speak to my parents mostly in English
<{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X272:1:Z>
So I think <mention> breakfast </mention> in Singhalese means uh
<O> two-Singhalese-words </O> I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X273:1:Z>
<O> one-Singhalese-word </O> means uh <mention> in the morning
</mention> <O> one-Singhalese-word </O> means <mention> food </mention>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X274:1:Z>
So <mention> food in the morning </mention> is <O>
two-Singhalese-words <O> I think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#275:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#276:1:A>
<O> Two-Singhalese-words </O> <&> A overlaps with Z  ' s unclear
speech </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#277:1:A>
Uhm yeah thank you uh very good thank you <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#278:1:A>
How come you <.> s </.> you talk <.> t </.> with your parents in
<.> Eng </.> in English but not in Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#279:1:A>
That  ' s very strange to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#280:1:A>
You know it  ' s your mother tongue

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#281:1:A>
English is not your mother tongue

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X282:1:Z>
Yeah in a sense I speak English plus Singhalese so it  ' s it  ' s uh
it  ' s a mixture of English plus Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X283:1:Z>
So if I say something about breakfast I might say something in
Singhalese and say <mention> breakfast </mention> in English

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X284:1:Z>
So that  ' s why as soon as you ask what does <mention> breakfast
</mention> mean in Singhalese I couldn't really quickly tell the word because
I wasn't too sure about it you know so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#285:1:A>
I find it very interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#286:1:A>
You know in Hong Kong we often talk with people in a mixture of
English and Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#287:1:A>
I think that  ' s the same

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#288:1:A>
Is this the same case in Sri Lanka

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#289:1:A>
Is it a very uhm general situation or some or very special one
like you

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#290:1:A>
<{> <[> Do </[> you think you  ' re special

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X291:1:Z>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X292:1:Z>
I  ' m not too sure whether I  ' m special but it  ' s just that uh I
come from Kuala Lumpur

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X293:1:Z>
And that  ' s the capital of Sri Lanka

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X294:1:Z>
And I guess most other people there who are educated and who have
been going to like leading schools in Sri Lanka speak a lot of English but
when they go to the rural areas most of them don't know English

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X295:1:Z>
They speak Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X296:1:Z>
So there are a lot of people who speak English in Kuala Lumpur
and the areas close to Kuala Lumpur </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#297:1:A>
So you mean people living in the big cities and uhm in on
urban area speak a lot of English rather than their mother tongue or a
mixture of them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X298:1:Z>
Uh it  ' s a mixture of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X299:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X300:1:Z>
Like you speak English as well as Singhalese yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#301:1:A>
<[> Ah huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#302:1:A>
Some people in Hong Kong uhm don't agree with this kind of
situation because they think uhm the English is degrade undermines the
Cantonese because when <.> yo </.> you speak in both languages and one uhm
can't you can't speak very fluent Cantonese you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#303:1:A>
Because you have to sometimes you  ' ll use to uh to use some kind
of English words and then you you just forget your mother tongue <&> laughter
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#304:1:A>
So <.> wh </.> what do you think about that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X305:1:Z>
Uh actually I  ' m not in the same situation <&>

$A-laughs </&> because sometimes I forget my mother tongue <&>

$A-laughs </&> just like now you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X306:1:Z>
So I speak a mixture of English plus Singhalese <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X307:1:Z>
Even if I go back home even if I am speaking to someone who
doesn't know English sometimes I might put English first because I won't
realise that <{2> <[2> and </[2> you just I  ' m got I got so used to English

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X308:1:Z>
Just comes out <unc> a few words </unc> naturally </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#309:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#310:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#311:1:A>
Uhm what what what  ' s the teaching medium in <.> S </.> uh Sri
Lanka

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#312:1:A>
Is it English or Singhalese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X313:1:Z>
It  ' s it  ' s Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X314:1:Z>
We do our O-Levels as well as our A-Levels in Singhalese

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X315:1:Z>
It  ' s the first language and we just do a paper in English as a
second language

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X316:1:Z>
But uh there are schools like international schools where you can
do either A-Levels or <?> Latin </?> O-Levels </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#317:1:A>
Do you study English since kindergarten

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X318:1:Z>
Uh yes I study English since kindergarten uh as a second language
but I did my O- levels and my A-Levels in Singhalese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#319:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#320:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X325:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#326:1:A>
Yah yah that  ' s right because my mom miss misses me very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#327:1:A>
And they needs me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X328:1:Z>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X330:1:Z>
<[> Really </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X331:1:Z>
</{> Why </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#332:1:A>
Because they don't want me to go to US

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X333:1:Z>
Really

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X334:1:Z>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X335:1:Z>
Why is that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#336:1:A>
Because they want me to stay in Hong Kong and have uhm you
know to to think about my future

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#337:1:A>
Yeah because you know I have to graduate uh from university uhm in
nineteen ninety five

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#338:1:A>
And until now I haven't finger out what I want to do anyway <&>
laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X339:1:Z>
Oh yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#340:1:A>
Yeah because I you know <&> tut </&> I  ' m studying uh English
and Japanese but it  ' s not a kind it  ' s not professional

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#341:1:A>
So I have to decide which field I like to <&> tut </&> you know to
join

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#342:1:A>
Uh uh I have to think about my career and future

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#343:1:A>
Uhm that it  ' s really confusing <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#344:1:A>
I hate it <&> laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X345:1:Z>
I know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X346:1:Z>
I <unc> a-few-words </unc> when I when I was after my
O-Levels when I was doing my before I did A-Levels I wasn't sure what I
wanted to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X347:1:Z>
I wanted to do Dentistry but though my father was a dentist I
wasn't like they didn't push me saying go to Dentistry

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X348:1:Z>
You know so I was thinking like am I choosing the correct field

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X349:1:Z>
You know I like Dentistry but yet I wasn't sure so in that period
was very confusing because I wasn't sure what to do what is future going to
be

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X350:1:Z>
So you need to think a lot about it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#351:1:A>
Yeah I know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#352:1:A>
Sometimes you have to think about what society what kind what kind
of people society needs

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#353:1:A>
And I think family gives you a lot of influence

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#354:1:A>
I think that  ' s very that  ' s very <&> tut </&> important

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#355:1:A>
Well anyway I don't know what  ' s important <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#356:1:A>

priority right now

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#357:1:A>

Yeah we are the same kind of people aren't we

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X383:1:Z>
Yeah but money is not everything you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X384:1:Z>
So you should never think about earning money you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X385:1:Z>
You should just do what you feel like doing what you want to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X386:1:Z>
Uh whatever you earn is <unc> two-words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X387:1:Z>
You should never think about just money

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X388:1:Z>
It  ' s not worth it </X> <&>

$A-laughs </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#389:1:A>
Yeah I I totally agree with you because money isn't
everything right

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#390:1:A>
And in my life friendship is the most important thing Prinji

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X391:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#392:1:A>
<[> You  ' re </[> </{> the people I really treasure

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#393:1:A>
Yeah I like you very much <&> both laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#394:1:A>
So what what  ' s the most important thing in your life

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X395:1:Z>
Well first comes my family and then comes my friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X396:1:Z>
Because uh when I came to Hong Kong when I really realise the
value of friendship because I don't have anyone here except for some uh
family friends but like they are very busy with their own work so I don't
always like ask them for help

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X397:1:Z>
But during my difficult times my friends had been with me the
friends whom I  ' ve got to know for one year like my overseas as well as my
local friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X398:1:Z>
So my I I really value friendship because friendship been
something very important to me

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X399:1:Z>
And I  ' m a sort of a sensitive person so if something happens
between me and another friend it uhm bothers me a lot you know because I
always want to get friendship straight

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X400:1:Z>
I just want you know I don't want any quarrels or any
misunderstandings between friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X401:1:Z>
So you know what recently I had a big <.> mis </.>
misunderstanding with a friend of mine

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X402:1:Z>
And it hurt me a lot

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X403:1:Z>
It hurt me very much and I it took me some time to get over the
whole thing and you now start new again

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X404:1:Z>
So I value friendship a lot and more than that I value my family
and you know <unc> two-words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#405:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#406:1:A>
Yes indeed I agree with you because I think man can't stand alone
in this world

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#407:1:A>
Sometimes not sometimes I think all the times we need support and
love from our friends and people we love

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#408:1:A>
<.> Some </.> uh I think sometimes we have to give and receive
love at the same time

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#409:1:A>
But that  ' s that  ' s not very easy to do because I don't know
sometimes I think uhm <&> tut </&> I  ' m still learning this kind of thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#410:1:A>
Yeah I I don't know when when shall I graduate from <&> laughter
</&> from the school of you know uh in <.> di </.> different school of
society

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#411:1:A>
Well yeah that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#412:1:A>
Friendship is very much it  ' s very very important

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X413:1:Z>
Uhm uhm but uh just as you said now that you have to give love
and have to receive love but I don't know it  ' s like as I told you earlier I
got hurt form a misunderstanding sometimes some time back

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X414:1:Z>
And I was like telling my other friends you know I I try to help
my friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X415:1:Z>
I try to do something for them

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X416:1:Z>
And sometimes it doesn't go uh to the way I plan you know like
you give love to them but you don't receive it

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X417:1:Z>
You know so because of that I  ' m not so keen on receiving love at
the moment

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X418:1:Z>
I just want to give what I have to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X419:1:Z>
And at that time I was just thinking you know am I giving too
much for them you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X420:1:Z>
I  ' m doing so much for them but yet they don't see that you know
and they think it  ' s like it  ' s not very significant or <{> <[> something
</[> like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X421:1:Z>
Yeah something they take it for granted you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X422:1:Z>
And I don't like that cos so I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X423:1:Z>
Friendship is uh something very complicated you know so I don't
think I ever graduate from it because its really complicated

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X424:1:Z>
You can't like you have to everyday you learn something new from
friendship I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X425:1:Z>
Learn about people and how they react to everything because each
person is different each person is an individual

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X426:1:Z>
So we have to always think from their point of view as well you
know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X427:1:Z>
So uh I don't know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#428:1:A>
<[> Granted </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#429:1:A>
Well I think I think friendship is something very uh delicate

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#430:1:A>
You need time and you know your heart to cultivate it very in a
very careful way

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#431:1:A>
Uhm sometimes you  ' ll you  ' ll break it suddenly after <&> laughter
</&> you you have cultivated for so <.> lo </.> for a long time

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#432:1:A>
I think that  ' s do you think it is there is a guarantee in
friendship

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X433:1:Z>
Uh I don't know what do you mean by guarantee in friendship </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#434:1:A>
Well I mean uhm its something that can you really trust your
friends forever

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X435:1:Z>
Actually that  ' s what I want to do because I want to like there  ' s
a saying which says that to trust a person is much greater than to love that
person because before loving a person you should be able to trust that person
you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X436:1:Z>
So uhm I don't know like sometimes I feel that I trust people too
much and I think each person it  ' s like me

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X437:1:Z>
Each person is trust worthy

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X438:1:Z>
Each person will do best for the other <.> per </.> other person
you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X439:1:Z>
But I guess it  ' s not same as everyone

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X440:1:Z>
Some people they just do for themselves what they want to do

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X441:1:Z>
So it depends on you know the person whom you  ' re referring to

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X442:1:Z>
Some people might be trust worthy some people might not be so I  ' m
not too sure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#443:1:A>
Where are we just now <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#444:1:A>
Pringi help me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X445:1:Z>
About friendship </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#446:1:A>
Oh yes <{> <[> friendship </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#447:1:A>
Let  ' s talk about another thing <&> laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X448:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X449:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#450:1:A>
Uhm well do you think <.> Ho </.> uh people in Hong Kong are
very money-oriented

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X451:1:Z>
Yes I think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X452:1:Z>
Uh I don't know Hong Kong is a very very busy place you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X453:1:Z>
It  ' s it  ' s like always rush rush everywhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X454:1:Z>
People running here and there like you know it  ' s just too busy
for me

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X455:1:Z>
I I don't think I would like to after I graduate I think I would
like to go back to my own country because this place is too busy too crowded
and you know everywhere you go you see people everywhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X456:1:Z>
And just even on the MTR you know sometimes like I want my own
space you know around me and its so crowded in the MTR and I just don't I
just don't like that you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X457:1:Z>
And I think people are quite money-oriented in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X458:1:Z>
They just work for just that you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#459:1:A>
Yeah I wonder were what <.> k </.> what kind of life uhm <&>
tut </&> you will lead in Sri Lanka

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#460:1:A>
Is it very harmonious very comfortable

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#461:1:A>
What kind of life do you live in do you lead in Sri Lanka

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X462:1:Z>
Uh very quiet life I think but at the moment there are a lot of
problems in Sri Lanka as for political problems

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X463:1:Z>
So actually me and my family we don't get involved in politics so
we don't really care about what  ' s happening in politics you know so whatever
happens we just lead our own life and we just do our own thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X464:1:Z>
So I think I don't know like even when I went uh back home for
the summer it was so like it was a big difference because like whole of last
year like everyday school from eight thirty to five in the evening come back
eat and then go to the library studies

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X465:1:Z>
It was all this rush rush

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X466:1:Z>
And when I went back home I was able to really rest and have a
very quiet time

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X467:1:Z>
You know so I think it should you should visit Sri Lanka some
time and we can see it for yourself you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#468:1:A>
Yeah I I would love to

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#469:1:A>
<.> Wh </.> When will you go back to Sri Lanka

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X470:1:Z>
Uh I think I might go back during the summer next year because
during uh <.> dur </.> </X> </I>


<I>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X471:2:Z>
This is you haven't mentioned this before

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X472:2:Z>
A fund </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#473:2:A>
Uhm I I don't I don't know exactly the name of the fund but
it  ' s a fund which uhm is created by <unc> one-word </unc> part of
the labourer  ' s salary

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#474:2:A>
And then uhm in the past uhm they cannot take back their fund
unless they are old or they are retired

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#475:2:A>
But <{> <[> uhm many </[> many labours are coming from other
provinces so they are afraid that they can't take back their funds

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#476:2:A>
So when the regulation change they quit their job because they
want to get back their funds

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X477:2:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X478:2:Z>
So it  ' s a kind of provident fund </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#479:2:A>
Uhm I think so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X480:2:Z>
Yes you have to look at find out about the term is in Chinese and
then look it up and find the exact wording

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X481:2:Z>
<{> <[> It  ' s </[> probably like a provident fund or retirement
fund

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X482:2:Z>
Provident fund sounds more like the right term </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#483:2:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#484:2:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X485:2:Z>
<{> <[> But it </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#486:2:A>
<[> Will it </[> </{> create a big problem because at that
time many labourers quit their jobs so the businessmen need to explain to
them that they can get back their fund in the future but they are not quite
sure because the regulations are changing rapidly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X487:2:Z>
When was it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#488:2:A>
I think it  ' s a few months ago

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X489:2:Z>
Oh good

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X490:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X491:2:Z>
It  ' s quite recent

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X492:2:Z>
Yes I make a side about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X493:2:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X494:2:Z>
Who you are going to find out about it from

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X495:2:Z>
<{> <[> I suppose the </[> officials people in business </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#496:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#497:2:A>
<{> <[> I think </[> I will interview my relative and some
companies which have a large number of labourers from other provinces

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X498:2:Z>
<[> Will you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X499:2:Z>
Will you be able to talk to some other workers </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#500:2:A>
Uhm I I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X501:2:Z>
See if you can do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X502:2:Z>
Uh I should imagine you can speak some uh Putonghua </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#503:2:A>
Some <&> laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X504:2:Z>
I suspect that they  ' re in the same situation but if you can get
direct to those people you might find some quite interesting comments

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X505:2:Z>
Uh that  ' s nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X506:2:Z>
Uh and the pre-terms </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#507:2:A>
Pre-terms

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X508:2:Z>
Is it uh important pre-terms </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#509:2:A>
I don't know if it is called pre-terms <{> <[> from </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X510:2:Z>
<[> I </[> </{> haven't heard anything called the pre-term

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X511:2:Z>
So it  ' s typed so VAT something like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#512:2:A>
It  ' s something it  ' s something like sales tax but <{> <[>
<,> </[> uhm you you need to pay the tax before you really sell the goods in
<.> s </.> China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X513:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X514:2:Z>
And you don't get the money back </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#515:2:A>
Uh you can get the money back but we don't know when you can
get them back

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X516:2:Z>
Do you mean you get all the money back or just part </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#517:2:A>
Uh you can get part of the money back

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X518:2:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#519:2:A>
But uh you you don't know when you can get back all the money
because the amount that is given in each year is is quite constant

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#520:2:A>
The office the officials will only give a <.> num </.> a number of
money or a an amount each year

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#521:2:A>
So if uh if the number if the amount need to be refund is is
greater than that number so you need to wait for the next year

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#522:2:A>
So and then you wait and wait wait

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X523:2:Z>
So otherwise they ask you to overpay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#524:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X525:2:Z>
Say say that are not quite sure as they ask you to pay

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X526:2:Z>
Say a million dollars and then the bill actually comes to eight
hundred thousands <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh they  ' re supposed to refund you the
two hundred thousand <{2> <[2> but </[2> in fact they don't do it <{3> <[3>
Or they take a long time to do it </[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#527:2:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#528:2:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#529:2:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm so may be you </[3> </{3> you can get fifteen
thousand this year fifteen hundred <{1> <[1> this year </[1> and then next
year you can get some back <{2> <[2> but </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X530:2:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X531:2:Z>
<[2> <?> They call it </?> </[2> </{2> <unc> one-word
</unc> and drafts </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#532:2:A>
Yeah but you don't know when you can get back all the money

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X533:2:Z>
All right

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X534:2:Z>
That sounds good

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X535:2:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X536:2:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#537:2:A>
<[> So </[> </{> so many companies uh <&> tut </&> don't
don't sell the goods in China because of this regulation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X538:2:Z>
Oh I see

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X539:2:Z>
And in a way that really comes under this part here

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X540:2:Z>
Uh this part is is a good side about it because it  ' s a specific
event that affect it the industry

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X541:2:Z>
And it  ' s probably haven't been written about

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X542:2:Z>
So I think it  ' s quite a good one

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X543:2:Z>
This one here is sort of a general problems that may fit better
under there unless you can find some change some reason for separating it out

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X544:2:Z>
Your travel plan is fine but when are you suppose to have these
thing in </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#545:2:A>
I think may be on the sixth <&>

$Z-laughs </&> or <{> <[> seventh of </[> April

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X546:2:Z>
<[> Or was it </[> </{> uh April not May uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#547:2:A>
No April

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X548:2:Z>
Well it can't be April because you want to go in Easter holiday
which is in April </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#549:2:A>
Yes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#550:2:A>
Is it eight or ninth April

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X551:2:Z>
May

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X552:2:Z>
I thought it was on twenty eighth of April but I  ' ve forgotten
about that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#553:2:A>
Because the fourth of April is Easter <.> ho </.> is Ching
Ming Festival

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#554:2:A>
<{1> <[1> And </[1> from fifth </{2> <[2> to </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X555:2:Z>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X556:2:Z>
<[2> Now </[2> </{2> what I  ' m saying is when do you have to give
it in </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#557:2:A>
Aw aw

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X558:2:Z>
It  ' s <{> <[> twenty </[> eighth of April </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#559:2:A>
<[> Twenty </[> </{> twenty-sixth

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X560:2:Z>
Will you will you be leaving yourself enough time </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#561:2:A>
Uhm I think the most <.> par </.> the most of the most of the
contents I  ' ll interview the people doing business in China <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> through phone calls <{2> <[2> or </[2> when they come back <{3> <[3>
from China </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#562:2:A>
And I think I  ' ll I will only do some interview about the
government officials or some labourers in the Easter holiday

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X563:2:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X564:2:Z>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X565:2:Z>
<[3> Good </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X566:2:Z>
Well I think you can certainly prepare yourself by talking to
people on the phone even if you can't do the story from it

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X567:2:Z>
And gathering statistics and talking to as many people here who
are involved in investing in China and business in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X568:2:Z>
Uhm so that you got a pretty good idea of what  ' s going on before
you actually go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X569:2:Z>
And can know where your story is going even if you don't want to
write it to that point

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X570:2:Z>
So that you know what to look for in China and uh uh can write it
quickly when you come back

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X571:2:Z>
Can you get Chinese Government publications here too </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#572:2:A>
I think I can get some <{> <[> and </[> I can ask my
relatives to bring me some

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X573:2:Z>
<[> Yeah I  ' m looking to that </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X574:2:Z>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X575:2:Z>
Yup

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X576:2:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X577:2:Z>
That  ' s what I call a shoebox job

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X578:2:Z>
You  ' re going to have a big box to put all of your information in
because you can have to get together a lot

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X579:2:Z>
Good

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X580:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X581:2:Z>
You got any worries </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#582:2:A>
Uhm not as worry as before

<$Z> <X> <&> Laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X583:2:Z>
Well that a bit more positive

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X584:2:Z>
What about the money to go to China </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#585:2:A>
Uhm I think it  ' s I think it  ' s not a problem because I I
don't think it will be expensive

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X586:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X587:2:Z>
Have you worked out where you can stay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#588:2:A>
Uhm no

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X589:2:Z>
All right

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X590:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X591:2:Z>
Well <?> nearer </?> the time we will looking to the money
situation

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X592:2:Z>
And see what money is available what we can get for you to defray
your expenses

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X593:2:Z>
Uhm cos I think it  ' s a good to go there

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X594:2:Z>
Uhm anyway anyway even if you  ' re not doing business but uh it  ' s
a good to go there and actually get information from the ground

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X595:2:Z>
You might find in the end that you can actually do most of your
story on what you get in China and that what you collect in Hong Kong is only
background but we shall see

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X596:2:Z>
We shall see

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X597:2:Z>
I  ' ll be interested to hear what you get

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X598:2:Z>
And have other people in the third year been to China to do
reporting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#599:2:A>
Uhm they  ' ve been to China for travelling <&> laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X600:2:Z>
Right <&> Z overlaps with A  ' s unclear speech </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X601:2:Z>
Do you know anybody who has been to China to do any reporting
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#602:2:A>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X603:2:Z>
Your trip to China <unc> two-words </unc> the official
you know that that you can find uh for another business people that you can
find and ask if they might have interviewed the workers

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X604:2:Z>
You might even find workers works outside on the street I don't
know but how they would take to being stopped to interviewed

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X605:2:Z>
Don't get yourself arrested but <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X606:2:Z>
You know thieves hang around the station I don't know if this
still a problem with finding work but people used to hang around the station
waiting for jobs because that was a sort of centre

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X607:2:Z>
It  ' s possible you might be able to talk to people there

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X608:2:Z>
Hard jobs

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X609:2:Z>
Right it looks as if it  ' s getting <.> f </.> on fine

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X610:2:Z>
Your next uh job is to collect statistics to collect background
and start talking to people

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X611:2:Z>
Is this my copy </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#612:2:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X613:2:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X614:2:Z>
Okay I  ' ll keep hold of this

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X615:2:Z>
Uh get over this to TDC

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X616:2:Z>
Get to the various organisations where but business people go who
are interested in investing in China

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X617:2:Z>
The American Chamber of Commerce will probably help you actually
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and the British Chamber of Commerce bound to have uh some
people there who are Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X618:2:Z>
What do you want to talk to other foreigners too <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X619:2:Z>
Other foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X620:2:Z>
Foreigners too <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X621:2:Z>
These days you  ' re not quite sure what Hong Kong people are

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X622:2:Z>
Are they really Chinese or are they foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X623:2:Z>
Uhm but you you might find that there  ' s a uh some some foreign
business people who are willing to talk to you as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X624:2:Z>
Might get some information from

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X625:2:Z>
Okay so that  ' s sort of gathering your basic information upon
which to start

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#X626:2:Z>
And have you got a computer at home </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-035#627:2:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-035#628:2:A>
