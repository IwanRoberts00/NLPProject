<ICE-HK:S2B-019#5:1:B>
Thanks for joining us

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#6:1:B>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is adamant that differences
with China over Hong Kong  ' s new airport be solved independently from other
issues

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#7:1:B>
That in reference to reports that Beijing is using the airport row
to block efforts to speed up the pace of democracy here

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#8:1:B>
But as May Wong reports Hurd says political reform will be discussed
with China in the near future <O> report by May Wong with speeches by Douglas
Hurd </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#9:1:B>
The news conference came at the end of a busy day for the Foreign
Secretary

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#10:1:B>
Earlier Hurd met Omelco members and heard the views of different
political camps

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#11:1:B>
He was non-committal on the issue of political reform

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#12:1:B>
Hurd accepted a petition from a group of husbands and children of
II mothers before going into a meeting with Omelco members this afternoon

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#13:1:B>
A wide range of issues of local concern was covered from China  ' s
trade status to the airport and in particular the nineteen ninety-five Legco
elections <,> but nothing new seems to have emerged

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#14:1:B>
Baroness Dunn quoted Hurd as saying the Governor Chris Patten still
needs to have wide consultations before reporting to the British Government

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X15:1:Z>
And after that is done then they will uh commence uh they will
approach the Chinese authorities for uh to to seek their view </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#16:1:B>
Allen Lee pushed his favourite through train issue

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#17:1:C>
And his answer is it is desirable

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#18:1:C>
Uh it is desirable to have that through train in nineteen
ninety-five <,> past nineteen ninety-seven

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#19:1:B>
Yeung Sum said Hurd was aware many people in Hong Kong wanted
a faster pace of democracy but he would only rehash his pledge to take it up
with China at an appropriate time

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#20:1:B>
Hurd also reportedly said appointments to the District Boards and
to Exco are matters for the Hong Kong Government alone

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#21:1:D>
We don't get much uh so to speak uh uh <.> con </.> uh
confirmation you know from from him because it still depend on the talk with
the Chinese Government

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#22:1:B>
Also today the visiting Foreign Secretary met other community
leaders

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#23:1:B>
He also visited a container terminal and a housing estate where the
politician in Douglas Hurd and his host Governor Chris Patten was very much
in evidence

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#24:1:B>
Having been secluded from the public eye for most of Sunday Douglas
Hurd was back in limelight today

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#25:1:B>
On a visit to Clague Garden Estates in Tsuen Wan <,> along with the
Governor Chris Patten <,> the two men worked in the crowds as only the
consummate politicians they are could <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#26:1:B>
A brief stop at a center for the elderly made these folks  '  day

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#27:1:B>
Earlier Hurd and Patten dropped in at the <?> Yuen Yuen </?>
Institute a Taoist temple in Tsuen Wan

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#28:1:B>
The first stop of the day was Hong Kong International Terminals in
Kwai Chung

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#29:1:B>
Hurd went there without Patten and was shown around by terminal
boss Li Ka-Shing <,> who left Hurd with a platter of memories <O> statement
by Douglas Hurd </O>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#30:1:B>
In a meeting later with the Chairmen of the two municipal councils
and nineteen District Boards <,> the function and composition of District
Boards <,> the deteriorating law and order situation <,> inflation and
Sino-British Hong Kong relations were raised

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X31:1:Z>
Mr Hurd uh listened <.> ver </.> very carefully about what we uh
said at the meeting and he said he will relate all this information to the
Government </X>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X32:1:Z>
He gave us the impression that he is also very concerned and
caring about the Hong Kong problem </X> <O> speech by Douglas Hurd </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#33:1:A>
As Douglas Hurd mentioned in his news conference Chinese and
British negotiators will meet again on Thursday morning <,> to try to hammer
out their differences over airport financing plans

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#34:1:A>
Sources say the two sides will respond to proposals put on the
table during their meeting last week

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#35:1:A>
The Chinese side has voiced optimism the row will be settled but
not necessarily in the upcoming discussions

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#36:1:B>
The territory  ' s inflation rate went back up slightly in June
this year after being on a downward trend for five consecutive months

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#37:1:B>
The latest Consumer Price Index A stood at nine point three percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#38:1:B>
But the Government says there  ' s no cause for alarm

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#39:1:B>
Peri Chow reports

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#40:1:E>
The Consumer Price Index was at a high of thirteen point nine
percent in April last year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#41:1:E>
And only in March this year did the figure fall back to a single
digit level <,> but the downward trend came to an end last month

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#42:1:E>
Compared with eight point eight percent in May the index rose by
half a percentage point to nine point three percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#43:1:E>
But officials noted that the index was calculated on a year on year
basis <,> and June last year was a low base for comparison <,> due to the
reduction in tobacco duty and the removal of the fuel surcharge from taxi
fares while June this year saw people paying more to rent a place <,> and
buying fresh fruit

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#44:1:E>
In a statement the Financial Secretary says the inflation rate has
been stabilizing and the territory is still on target for single-digit
inflation this year <,> but Hamish Macleod agrees that inflation at the
present level is still a matter of concern

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#45:1:E>
But a government economist says there  ' s no cause for alarm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X46:1:Z>
You can confirm it with an example of a car <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X47:1:Z>
The speed is decelerated but because the previously the speed was
fast that  ' s why the car has traveled quite a lot of distance already </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#48:1:E>
However economists in the private sector think the inflation
rate will continue to be on an upward trend

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X49:1:Z>
Because of the rapidly rising wages uh property rentals and so on
our internal price structure is rising quite rapidly

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X50:1:Z>
And if you look ahead to the next six months or so Hong Kong  ' s
economy should continue to show an encouraging performance

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#X51:1:Z>
And on the basis of that I think this internally generated
inflation will remain for some time </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#52:1:E>
Kwok predicts the Consumer Price Index A will be in the range
of nine point five to ten percent in the second half of the year

think that even Inland Revenue Department have more information to identify

can make some investigation on whether this buyer and seller actually are
doing a business and not doing a uh investment or buying a home for himself

Japan  ' s prime minister is promising a parliamentary debate on
electoral reform following the poor turnout in yesterday  ' s nationwide
elections

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#60:1:A>
Kiichi Miyazawa is however happy with his party  ' s victory in the
polls for half the seats in the Upper House of Parliament

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#61:1:A>

Dredging at <?> Merce </?> Bay has sparked strong protests
from both the fishing community and environmentalists

<ICE-HK:S2B-019#87:1:G>
The results of the meeting of the Environmental Pollution Advisory
Committee today proved that popular pressure does work

one hundred eighty fishermen in the area may not think so

<$H> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-019#93:1:H>
I don't think it should be a say protest but at least
government should find out <.> whe </.> whether they are suffering from say a
