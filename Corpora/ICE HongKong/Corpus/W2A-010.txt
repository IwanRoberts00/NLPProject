Colonial cities can be viewed as the <it> forerunners </it> of
what the contemporary capitalist world city would eventually become .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#4:1>
For .. . in the colonial and paracolonial societies and especially
Asia , Africa and Latin America .. . the representatives and institutions of
industrial capitalism first confronted those of ethnically , racially , and
culturally different pre-industrial and pre-capitalist societies at any
significant scale .

The gigantic mass is immobilized before the eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#7:1>
It is transformed into a texturology in which extremes coincide -
extremes of ambition and degradation , brutal oppositions of races and styles
, contrasts between yesterday  ' s buildings , already transformed into trash
cans , and today  ' s urban irruption that block out its space ...

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#8:1>
Its present invents itself , from hour to hour , in the act of
throwing away its previous accomplishments and challenging the future .

<bold> 1 . </bold> It is now widely acknowledged that Ridley
Scott  ' s <it> Blade Runner </it> &obrack;  1982/ 1992 &cbrack; initiated a whole tradition of
cult movies later grouped under the label &ldquo; cyberpunk." <it> Blade
Runner </it>  ' s style draws its images from urban spaces all over the world ,
including such Asian cities as Tokyo and Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#11:1>
Science fiction film critics are less aware , however , that when
<it> anime </it> film director Mamoru Oshii was looking for a model of the
city of the future in a computerized world , he turned for his primary
inspiration to the cityscape of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#12:1>
Through his art designers , actual sports in the city of Hong Kong
were transformed into the mise-en-scène of <it> Ghost in the Shell </it> ,
first released in the United States in March 1996 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#13:1>
Science fiction has not fared well in Hong Kong &obrack;  wither in terms
of production or consumption &cbrack; , nor is there a cyberpunk culture among Hong
Kong  ' s young computers users .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#14:1>
So the question arises: what elements in Hong Kong provided
inspiration for this cinematic representation of a near-future city
characterized by decadence , anarchy , and fantasy on the one hand , and a
mistrusted , high-tech hyper-reality on the other ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#15:1>
Talking up this question , I will first suggest a reading of a
shopping complex in Hong Kong that emphasizes its fragmentation ,
disjunctiveness , and emphemerality .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#16:1>
Like <it> Blade Runner </it>  ' s &ldquo; Ridleyville , &rdquo; this
Hong Kong shopping complex intertwines past and future , memory and desire .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#17:1>
Finally , I will analyze the setting of <it> Ghost in the Shell </it>
, especially the parts that are clearly modeled on Hong Kong streets scenes
and architecture .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#18:1>
I hope to validate Antony King  ' s argument that colonial cities have
the best chance of establishing a cityscape of the future that embraces
racial and cultural difference . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#19:1>
Before going any further , let me address the politics of
representation , especially in the visual media of cyberpunk art and film .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#20:1>
Following the success of <it> Blade Runner </it> , such
cyber-thrillers as <it> Johnny Mnemonic </it> &obrack;  1995 &cbrack; , <it> Hackers </it> &obrack; 
1995 &cbrack; , <it> Lawnmower Man 2 </it> &obrack;  1996 &cbrack; , and <it> Strange Days </it> &obrack; 
1995 &cbrack; have also selectively used motifs of &ldquo; Asian &rdquo; design
environments , together with their visual icons , to portray cultural
difference and to create visual pleasure from postmodern pastiche .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#21:1>
As in <it> Blade Runner </it> , the most popular model for artists'
and filmmakers ' dark and sprawling cities of the suture is an Asian-dominated
metropolis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#22:1>
Cyberpunk novels , including Gibson  ' s <it> Neuromancer </it> &obrack;  1984)
and Stephenson  ' s <it> Snow Crash </it> &obrack;  1992 &cbrack; , likewise emphasize Asian
culture and urban style , suggesting &obrack;  as John Christie has argued &cbrack; &ldquo;
the replacement of the hegemonic state apparatus by multinationals , its
cultural pluralism &rdquo; &obrack;  173 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#23:1>
Whereas <it> Snow Crash </it>  ' s &ldquo; Mr . Lee  ' s Greater Hong
Kong &rdquo; is set in cyberspace, <it> Neuromancer </it>  ' s Night City , The
Sprawl , coffin hotel , and Ninsei are based on the Tokyo Bay area .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#24:1>
In his recent novel , <it> Idoru </it> &obrack;  1996 &cbrack; , Gibson even presents
organic buildings in a 21st-century Tokyo .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#25:1>
&obrack;  In this case , there must also be some connection to Hong Kong as
well , since in his acknowledgment to a Japanese director , Gibson mentions
&ldquo; Kowloon Walled City , &rdquo; which has &ldquo; continued to haunt
him &rdquo; &obrack;  n.pag. &cbrack; ever since the latter told him about it. &cbrack; </p> <O> A
picture </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#26:1>
For sf illustrator Barclay Shaw , the merging of cyberspace with
the sleazy , neon-lit visual passion in <it> Neuromancer </it> closely
resembles a chaotic Hong Kong street .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#27:1>
Commissioned as cover art for the 1986 Phantasia Press edition of the
novel , the painting chooses some Chinese characters &obrack;  Presumably taken from
Hong Kong shop signs &cbrack; for the foreground , highlighting not only a sense of
ethnic and cultural confusion and hybridity but also a continuous process of
the destructions and reconstructions so characteristic of contemporary
cityscapes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#28:1>
This is certainly in line with the cyberpunk convention of &ldquo;
the run-down inner-city slum-cum-tent settlement , overcrowded , trashed and
graffiti-ridden &rdquo; &obrack;  Bonner 194 &cbrack; , reminding us at the same time of <it>
Blade Runner </it>  ' s Ridleyville . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#29:1>
As Nigel Clark notes , &ldquo; <it> Neuromancer </it> and its
sequels feature a series of hyper-aestheticized urban spaces: terrains in
which vibrant new signifying surfaces are layered over the detritus of
obsolescent forms &rdquo; &obrack;  121 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#30:1>
As a city hustler who understands &ldquo; the dynamics of street
dealing &rdquo; &obrack;  <it> Neuromancer </it> 11 &cbrack; , Case knows well " that
burgeoning technologies require outlaw zones , &rdquo; the kind of space
provided by Chiba City , a &ldquo; magnet for the Sprawl  ' s techno-criminal
subcultures &rdquo; and a places inhabited by Chinese experts in &ldquo;
black medicine , implants , nerve-splicing , and microbionics &rdquo; &obrack;  6 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#31:1>
Looking at Shaw  ' s cover art , one might assume that the dark alley
to the right behind the drug store would be the sort of place where one of
these black market clinics might be found . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#32:1>
We also find visual icons relating to Chinese characters ,
obviously within a " Chinatown &rdquo; setting , in cyberpunk films such as
<it> Strange Days </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#33:1>
Set in Los Angeles a few days shy of the millennium , the sustains
film noir tradition through dark and explosive scenes of riots and chaos .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#34:1>
In between these hybridized sites and battle zones on the streets ,
Chinatown  ' s glittering lanterns &obrack;  not the authentic kind with real
candlelight , of course &cbrack; , together with the profusion of shops and
commercial sign boards characteristic of a normal busy Hong Kong street ,
juxtapose visual alternatives and establish a tone somewhere between
eroticism and dreariness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#35:1>
This kind of design , which marks the unmistakable miscellaneity of a
metropolis , suggests a near future where centers and peripheries do not hold
and where racial conflicts are at the point of explosion; it also provides an
appropriate way to exhibit an &ldquo; inverted millennarianism &rdquo; &obrack; 
Jameson 53 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#36:1>
Scenes from a kitchen in a Chinese restaurant depict violence and
intrigues played out among individuals , while collective racial protests and
riots are taking place in the streets .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#37:1>
It is curious that such " Chinese &rdquo; vignettes have become a
favourite among recent Hollywood filmmakers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#38:1>
Compared to the front of the restaurant in <it> Strange Days </it> ,
where decor and orderliness prevail , the kitchen is filmed as a clandestine
negative space signifying hiddenness and disorder .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#39:1>
In the restaurant kitchen , the flawed character Nero plays out his
drama of fighting back against corporate crimes , providing a contrast with
the public atrocities committed in front of millions of people during the New
Year countdown celebration at the movie  ' s conclusion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#40:1>
In <it> Strange Days </it> , &ldquo; Chinese &rdquo; spaces are
represented as hidden within the context of the future urban setting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#41:1>
Is there any cultural or ideological significance in this-beyond the
fact that a Chinese restaurant kitchen is an exotic spot ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#42:1>
Does this added element of Chineseness &obrack;  contrasted with the
exploding warfare among races and social classes in <it> Strange Days </it> )
help to bring out the theme of the intertwining relations between social
space and media space ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#43:1>
Finally , since Chinatown settings are spaces famous for being
inhabited by illegal immigrants , we will need to follow Homi Bhabha  ' s
critique of the &ldquo; metropolitan histories &rdquo; of the west , &ldquo;
the anomalous and discriminatory legal and cultural status assigned to
migrant , diasporic , and refugee populations &rdquo; who &ldquo; find
themselves on the frontiers between cultures and nations , often on the other
side of the law &rdquo; &obrack;  Bhabha 175 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#44:1>
<bold> 2 . </bold> We must be careful , however , in interpreting
the ways the Hong Kong cityscape is appropriated by cyberpunk literature and
films; we must remember that Hollywood has had a long history of
misrepresenting Hong Kong , from white-male fantasies about oriental girls &obrack; 
<it> The World of Suzy Wong </it> &obrack;  1961 &cbrack; &cbrack; to exploitative soft-core
pornographic eroticism &obrack;  the <it> Emmanuelle </it> films &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#45:1>
More recently , a quick shot in the low-budget <it> Lawnmower Man 2
</it> shows a yellow rickshaw pulled by a Chinese man on the street of yet
another Los Angeles of the future .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#46:1>
An offensive example of " non-equivalent sites of representation
&rdquo; &obrack;  Bhabha 176 &cbrack; , this rickshaaw scene exemplifies a brutal seizure of
a cultural sign by the west , a way of &ldquo; evoking .. . savage colonial
antecedents &rdquo; for the sake of presumed &ldquo; ideals of civility
&rdquo; &obrack;  Bhabha 175). <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#47:1>
Whether cyberpunk film directors are themselves free from this mire
of distortion in their renderings of Hong Kong  ' s urban images is of course
an important question to ask here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#48:1>
<it> Blade Runner </it>  ' s cultural references are indirect , yet
I propose to compare the design of the film  ' s city setting with an actual
spot in Hong Kong that may provide a paradigm for future global cities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#49:1>
The incredibly detailed Los Angeles of 2019 in <it> Blade Runner
</it> creates a futuristic noir atmosphere by heavily borrowing from Asian
motifs , albeit vagus and general ones , in its design of city icons and
social spaces .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#50:1>
With the artful &ldquo; retro-fitting &rdquo; and &ldquo; layering
&rdquo; of the Japanese sushi bar , the gigantic media screen of the geisha
girl ad , and a Chinese bio-engineer who &ldquo; only does eyes , &rdquo; the
city , critics are quick to point out , looks like &ldquo; Chinatown in
Tomorrowland &rdquo; &obrack;  Hunter 225); the sleazy cinematography results in a
hybrid and fractal combination of &ldquo; Hong KOng , New York , &obrack;  and &cbrack; Tokyo  ' s
Ginza district &rdquo; &obrack;  Sammon 101 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#51:1>
I would argue that considering Hong Kong as among the cinematic
models for the future city may inspire not only a further look at Hong Kong
at this present moment of political transition but also its potential for
developing into a " forerunner of what the contemporary capitalist world city
will eventually become &rdquo; &obrack;  King 38 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#52:1>
Perhaps because of its recent reabsorption by China , Hong Kong
has drawn enormous interest from urban scholars and social critics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#53:1>
Struggling historically between traditional Chinese culture and
British imperialism , and at this moment adjusting its full-fledged
capitalism in order to be embraced by socialism , Hong Kong  ' s postmodern
identity has been singled out as a unique case in the world , characterized
by &ldquo; disappearance &rdquo; and " hyphenation &rdquo; &obrack;  Abbas 1994;
1996 &cbrack; or dealt with in terms of &ldquo; discourses in collision under the
volcano &rdquo; &obrack;  Cuthbert 1995 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#54:1>
As someone who grew up in Hong Kong , I am particularly
fascinated by the dazzling visuals of <it> Blade Runner </it>  ' s Ridleyville
, its seamless weaving together of the futuristic and the traditional , as
well as its paradoxical delighting of the eye through an emphasis on urban
squalor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#55:1>
Other aspects-hybrid architectural spaces , crowdedness , the
polyglot or mishmash city-speak , the chaotic proliferation of neon
billboards above futuristic shopping arcades , the rain-soaked streets and
dragon signs-invite me to conclude that this Los Angeles of 2019 can indeed
be read as &ldquo; Hong Kong on a bad day &rdquo; &obrack;  Salisbury 96; Doel and
Clarke 163 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#56:1>
The questions remain to be asked: what illumination does <it> Blade
Runner </it> offer us for envisioning the 21st century cityscape , and what
role will Hong Kong play in shaping our expectations of the city of the
future ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#57:1>
This film  ' s &ldquo; radical eclecticism or ad hoc-ism &rdquo; &obrack; 
Bruno 66 &cbrack; catches my eye and inspires me to think about the evolving scenes
of my own city , freeing me from clichés &obrack;  Hong Kong is a dynamic and
international city with post-industrial and postmodernist characteristics ,
etc.)

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#58:1>
Let me go right to a specific Hong Kong space for a detailed
description , to demonstrate the value of placing Ridleyville and Hong Kong
together . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#59:1>
The place is located at the juncture of Happy Valley and Causeway
Bay around Russell Street and Sharp East Street , one of the most densely
populated areas of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#60:1>
Perhaps no other place can demonstrate so well the strange mix of
global and local in truly cosmopolitan downtown development .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#61:1>
The space occupies half a square mile of streets , shops , flyovers ,
and the recent addition of a mall , &ldquo; Times Square . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#62:1>
It is certainly an &ldquo; urban secret located at the intersection
of postmodern and science fiction &rdquo; &obrack;  Bukatman 12 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-010#63:1>
Apparently no parody was intended by naming the place after New
York;s Times Square , but the name does reflect and even reaffirm its own
historicity and timeless - albeit the kind of schizophrenic temporality that
Fredric Jameson uses in his famous reading of the Bonaventure Hotel &obrack;  80-85 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#64:1>
The complex itself , built on top of a busy metro station , stretches
from several levels underground to skyscraper height , looking down on the
adjacent , much <O> 2 photos </O> older buildings , &ldquo; indifference to
its surrounding &rdquo; &obrack;  Abbas 1996 , 221 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#65:1>
For city-planners , especially visitors , the awkward and abrupt
sense of discrepancies on all levels is impossible to miss .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#66:1>
The complex was built on a former tram-depot skirted by an old-style
street market and the quarters for lower echelon tram-company employees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#67:1>
Thus an area once inhabited by comparatively low-income locals has
been transformed by commercialism into a high-tech wonder , a bewildering
collage of signs and patterns with enough anarchic elements remaining &obrack;  a
small part of the market and old style shops &cbrack; to create a send of pastiche .

<ICE-HK:W2A-010#68:1>
Yet nothing unusual or uncanny is felt by the people who live there;
and in general the logic of capitalism , in which &ldquo; shopping is an
aesthetic experience &rdquo; &obrack;  Webster 212 &cbrack; , works beautifully , since the
spot has become &obrack;  with its advantages of proximity and diversity , its
availability and variety of consumer goods &cbrack; one of the busiest and most
prosperous places in Hong Kong . </p>
