<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#1:1:A>
One more thing about uhm the C test

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#2:1:A>
Uhm the test was conducted in St Francis in Fanling and in <{> <[>
Shek Kip Mei </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#3:1:B>
<[> Shek Kip Mei </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#4:1:B>
So there are more than enough Form Four <{1> <[1> and uhm </[1> but
the Form Four and I the the test that I did uhm was a bit unfortunate because
uhm so happen that <{2> <[2> it it was held after the </[2> exam

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#5:1:B>
And some of the students I don't know whether they are better ones
or poor ones

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#6:1:B>
They have already left the exam

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#7:1:B>
Then they can leave early <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> <{4> <[4> in in in the
room </[4> exam you <{5> <[5> see </[5>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#8:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#9:1:A>
<[2> They have the exam </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#10:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#11:1:C>
<[3> Oh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#12:1:C>
<[4> I see </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#13:1:C>
<[5> Okay </[5> </{5> after right after <[> which is I see </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#14:1:B>
<[> Yeah and then </[> </{> another thing it was I I told <{1>
<[1> them </[1> that there is no time limit <{2> <[2> on </[2> the test and
so many of them just didn't <,> <{3> <[3> take it <.> se </.> seriously </[3>
and just uhm did half way and then decided to go because they are hungry or
<{4> <[4> tired </[4> or whatever

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#15:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#16:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#17:1:A>
<[3> Finish it yeah yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#18:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X19:1:Z>
<[4> Oh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X20:1:Z>
Alright </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#21:1:B>
So the reality was affected but luckily uhm there is another
<{1> <[1> branch </[1> of Form Four students <{2> <[2> at the </[2> at the
Shek Kip <{3> <[3> Mei </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#22:1:A>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#23:1:A>
<[2> In Shek Kip Mei </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X24:1:Z>
<[3> But </[3> </{3> alright <[> the other <.> categ </.> <,> <.>
dis </.> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#25:1:A>
<[> That is slightly yeah it  ' s </[> </{> slightly different
uh different on the <?> zoom </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#26:1:A>
Each of uh the classes with uhm well invigilated by the Form
teacher <{> <[> and it </[> was small form

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X27:1:Z>
<[> Right </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X28:1:B>
<[> And then </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X29:1:B>
I believe that it it t would be more consistent actually

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X30:1:B>
The the uhm students in Shek Kip Mei uhm of uhm better level
better entry <{1> <[1> level </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X31:1:B>
Because uhm when they first started the school in Fanling they
just accepted some students from other schools left over from other schools

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X32:1:B>
But the ones in Form One are the better ones <{2> <[2> which </[2>
they they are the band two band one students

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X33:1:B>
Uhm <{3> <[3> but the the the </[3> Form <{4> <[4> Form Four that  ' s
</[4> she really anything you know could be really the the bottom

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X34:1:C>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X35:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X36:1:C>
<[3> But <unc> two words </unc> </[3> </{3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X37:1:Z>
<[4> I  ' m now check </[4> </{4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#38:1:A>
And uhm for the test in Shek Kip Mei I have uh faxed the
headmaster the headmistress of uhm this <,> instruction sheet been uh read by
Form teacher regulated <{> <[> <?> circulated </?> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X40:1:C>
<[> Everything is </[> </{> small uniform

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X41:1:Z>

<[2> Then </[2> </{2> tell them we will give it to them by

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#136:1:C>
I think that will give us sufficient time to <{1> <[1> <?> tell

When the RAs are here they they processed the data and then give

She  ' s a tourist <unc> one word </unc> yes I got it

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X176:1:Z>
But what I was thinking was that maybe in time of uh if it  ' s was
spread on the teachers to get their results

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X177:1:Z>
We can send RA over so that they can <?> lecturely </?> be shown
what collect

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X178:1:Z>
I mean with this with the teacher <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X179:1:Z>
Let  ' s presume the other messaging matter of getting authorizing
files <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and that could the RA job to relief the teacher

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X180:1:Z>
Do you think that  ' s <{2> <[2> practical </[2> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#181:1:C>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#226:1:B>
<[1> <?> Faith </?> </[1> </{1>

<[> Only </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#231:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#232:1:A>
When we correct the test we can count the <{> <[> <unc>
two words </unc> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#233:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#234:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#235:1:B>
It  ' s not the <?> buried </?> at all <{> <[> because </[> uhm it  ' s
too duplicated but anyway that that <,> bunch doesn't fit in the rest of the
school anyway

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#236:1:B>
Dominantly doesn't consider of uh St. Francis students

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#237:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#238:1:C>
Okay right uhm so it  ' s over anything else

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#239:1:A>
Well the anything is that I made a terrible mistake in typo a
typo error

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#240:1:A>
Instead of St. Francis I type in one on one <{1> <[1> of the </[1>
answer sheet D instead of uh S must be well <unc> several words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#241:1:A>
Yeah but I discover this uhm after I have copied the <{2> <[2>
whole </[2> log of things so <{3> <[3> but unless </[3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#242:1:C>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X243:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#244:1:C>
<[3> So she </[3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#245:1:B>
<[3> That there </[3> </{3> were two typo errors that we
found <{> <[> <,> </[> in the Form One test

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#246:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#247:1:A>
In the Form One test

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#248:1:B>
Yeah I can't remember <{> <[> <?> which part </?> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#249:1:C>
<[> Answer </[> </{> <{> <[> sheet or </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#250:1:A>
<[> Answer sheet </[> </{> or

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#251:1:B>
I can't remember but the the the matter any

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#252:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#253:1:B>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#254:1:C>
Uhm so the next time when you give uhm <unc> one word
</unc> Bureau uh seed sample for the uh native speakers we give them the
answer sheet as well

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#255:1:B>
Uh yeah maybe I can give them the answer sheet <{> <[>
<unc> one word </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X256:1:Z>
<[> I say </[> </{> as far as <,> giving that this sheet for them
</X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#257:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X258:1:Z>
Okay I meant I didn't give the one that I <{1> <[1> had </[1> the
answer <{2> <[2> sheet </[2> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#259:1:C>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#260:1:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#261:1:A>
I I mean <{1> <[1> because </[1> this <{2> <[2> <unc> several
words </unc> </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#262:1:C>
<[1> But </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X263:1:Z>
<[2> But I I know I just wasn't </[2> </{2> sure <{> <[> about
</[> that I mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#264:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#265:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#266:1:C>
Maybe we need to be consistent <{> <[> this is it the first three
</[> haven't got anything

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#267:1:A>
<[> Yeah it  ' s alright because </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#268:1:A>
Yeah because uhm well we we uh decide it an answer sheet for those
because uh it will be easier <{1> <[1> for mark </[1> because they are in
large quantity <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#269:1:A>
<{3> <[3> But for </[3> the native <{4> <[4> speaker <unc> one
word </unc> </[4>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#270:1:C>
<[1> To marking </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#271:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#272:1:C>
<[3> But this one </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#273:1:C>
<[4> I know </[4> </{4> it  ' ll be easier for them to see whether
they  ' ve done the wrong thing <{1> <[1> or not </[1> if they got it this way
than on the <{2> <[2> <?> plant </?> this </[2> way yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#274:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#275:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X276:1:Z>
I mean I I haven't thought because if given is a small number
that presumably to get them to mark it themselves

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X277:1:Z>
I mean what was the function of giving them the answer sheet just
bring information <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> <{2> <[2> basics </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#278:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#279:1:C>
<[2> Just </[2> </{2> for easy <{> <[> marking </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#280:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#281:1:A>
<{> <[> Just for </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X282:1:Z>
<[> Right </[> </{> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#283:1:C>
I think it can be consistent <{> <[> then leave </[> it at
what uhm has been done

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#284:1:C>
Okay so finish

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#285:1:A>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#286:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#287:1:C>
Okay then we will go to RA duties

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X288:1:Z>
Can we just uh check this uhm well uh just one thing I want to
say about uhm Angel <unc> two word </unc> name <{> <[> her </[>
Chinese name </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#289:1:C>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#290:1:C>
<?> Yi <{> <[> Song </[> </?>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#291:1:B>
<?> <[> Kai </[> </{> ming </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X292:1:Z>
Song Kai <{1> <[1> kai </[1> yin

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X293:1:Z>
Uhm she <,> she  ' s spent a year

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X294:1:Z>
She did she did uhm as you know she did the uh <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2> less MA

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X295:1:Z>
And for some reason she didn't choose the EFL option <{3> <[3>
<,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X296:1:Z>
I can't remember the details so it now <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X297:1:Z>
But uhm she came back and was uncertain exactly what she wanted
to do <{5> <[5> so she  ' s </[5> been working in the Tourist Association

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X298:1:Z>
She  ' s not very happy with that <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> and uh she
wants some <.> ac ac </.> academic stimulus

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X299:1:Z>
<{7> <[7> Now I talk to </[7> her before this came out I advise
her to apply for anything that come up to the papers for research studentship
and I say she would be in a <unc> one word </unc> situation in a
sense that whether career it looks to me and it will come <{8> <[8> into this
</[8> whether career for anybody in Linguistics is concerned in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X300:1:Z>
It  ' s it  ' s it  ' s got to be a <?> bilinguists </?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X301:1:Z>
Even if you been have a theoretical <{9> <[9> <,> <?> bias </?>
</[9> <{10> <[10> that </[10> whether works is and that  ' s whether jobs got
to be <{11> <[11> <,> </[11>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X302:1:Z>
So I say that she really need it uh my options

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X303:1:Z>
She really opt to go one of them was to go into the classroom and
she say she wasn't ready at the moment

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X304:1:Z>
She seems bright when she came <{12> <[12> across the </[12> way
that she use

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X305:1:Z>
So I said that uhm whatever RA she she got

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X306:1:Z>
She should be using it as a stimulus to do series reading that
she capable of that

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X307:1:Z>
<{13> <[13> So </[13> part of the restricted RA jobs which should
be introduce same of

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X308:1:Z>
<{14> <[14> She  ' s kind </[14> of us you know I think it would be
easily push to read the background theory and <{15> <[15> uh </[15>
discussion

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X309:1:Z>
So <{16> <[16> this </[16> kind of project I think might be very
useful for her </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#310:1:C>
<[1> Song </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#311:1:B>
<[2> MA </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#312:1:B>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#313:1:B>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#314:1:B>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#315:1:B>
<[6> No </[6> </{6>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#316:1:A>
<[7> No she  ' s some she came from </[7> </{7>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#317:1:B>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#318:1:B>
<[9> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[9> </{9>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#319:1:B>
<[10> Uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#320:1:B>
<[11> Yeah </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#321:1:B>
<[12> Yeah </[12> </{12>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#322:1:B>
<[13> Uhm </[13> </{13>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#323:1:B>
<[14> Uhm uhm </[14> </{14>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#324:1:B>
<[15> I know </[15> </{15>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#325:1:B>
<[16> Yeah </[16> </{16>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#326:1:B>
Actually that was uh Susanna  ' s uhm idea to that she <{1> <[1>
would </[1> be capable of doing <{2> <[2> deep </[2> review and <{3> <[3>
when </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X327:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#328:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X329:1:Z>
<[3> Exactly </[3> </{3> <{1> <[1> exactly </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X330:1:Z>
So I mean we can use <{2> <[2> her </[2> as the resource

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X331:1:Z>
That will be good for her <{3> <[3> <,> but </[3> it will be good
for the project </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#332:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#333:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#334:1:B>
<[3> Yeah </[3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#335:1:C>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#336:1:B>
She  ' s also <{> <[> thinking of </[> using the <,> the
opportunity maybe to enrol for an MPhil

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X337:1:Z>
<[> So </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X338:1:Z>
Yes well that <{1> <[1> that that uh </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X339:1:Z>
That should be no problem getting her part time MPhil <{2> <[2>
<,> </[2> restriction <{3> <[3> uh </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X340:1:Z>
I would think that this year is <unc> one word </unc>
<{4> <[4> than the </[4> work you should be looked into get settle in this
work <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X341:1:Z>
Uhm draw on and make sure she reaches the background stuff <{6>
<[6> and </[6> then in consultation with you or anybody else

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X342:1:Z>
Isolated topic uhm given she  ' s not on a rush

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X343:1:Z>
<{7> <[7> I mean </[7> she may think she is in a rush <{8> <[8>
<,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X344:1:Z>
But from time from our from points of view supervisor would
always like to try to get people who have in fact done about the years work
thinking reading and so on <{9> <[9> <,> </[9> to the point where they really
know what their topic is at that stage

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X345:1:Z>
It might change later on but the point is uh initial stage of
work

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X346:1:Z>
You will save a lot of hesitation for her as well as her
supervisor

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X347:1:Z>
But I think that should be no problem of getting a part time
registration

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X348:1:Z>
I  ' ve got to check I  ' ve to chaise there  ' s another <?>
unfinished </?> business pass

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X349:1:Z>
I  ' ve got to check about whether we can give you <unc> three
words </unc> <{10> <[10> supervise </[10> which I  ' ve been very to uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X350:1:Z>
I think it should be no problem but I  ' ve got to confirm it <{11>
<[11> with the </[11> committee

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X351:1:Z>
But uhm that was just background on her

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#X352:1:Z>
I think she  ' s a kind of person that may be good for us <{12>
<[12> <,> </[12> that we can push her </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#353:1:C>

MA in Baptist

<$A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#436:1:C>
You mention about the native people

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-078#437:1:B>
Uhm I didn't interview him because he

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#438:1:B>
I  ' ve uh this feeling that he was a kind of backpacker or want to
earn a little bit of money and then will move on to another country <{1> <[1>
<,> </[1> as soon as he he <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> he can buy the air ticket <{3>
<[3> <,> </[3> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#439:1:B>

from helping in a translation a machine translation project in Japan which he
did quite well uh accord according to letter of reference

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#440:1:B>
Uhm he rang me up at home he rang me at work and then I was too
busy and then I told gave him my home number

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#441:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#442:1:B>
JJ in Wanchai or some what in Lan Kwai Fong

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#443:1:B>

she  ' s very young to me very fresh

<ICE-HK:S1B-078#477:1:C>
And uhm I don't know how she can be compared
