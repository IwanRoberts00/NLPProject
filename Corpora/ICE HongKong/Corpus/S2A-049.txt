<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-049#1:1:A>
Good afternoon everyone

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#2:1:A>
I would like first to thank KK for giving me this uhm opportunity to
uh talk to you about uh code switching and code mixing area which I haven
given quite a lot of courses

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#3:1:A>
Uh I  ' m particularly in interested in being here to talk about this
topic because here is the place where a lot of work in this area has been
done

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#4:1:A>
Uhm I would say pioneering work

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#5:1:A>
I  ' m of course referring to the work uh done by Doctor John Gibbons
who collected code switching data between Cantonese and English uh by asking
twenty seven students Hong Kong U students uhm in the nineteen eighties uh to
record and uh to report their own verbal behaviours which invariably included
some form of what we call at first <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#6:1:A>
And later on mix uh and in fact a lot of the information and details
can be found in this monograph which I suppose those at the back could not be
able to see

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#7:1:A>
Because uh the title is no longer <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#8:1:A>
Uh well or we have to be uhm the force time including with it for
that way

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#9:1:A>
Uhm the uhm this present study was directly inspired by uh John
Gibbons uh in terms of the methodology

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#10:1:A>
Uh in habit if you yourself reported language dairies with the out
or the <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#11:1:A>
Uh and the details can be found on <?> datas </?> eighteen to
twenty one of his book

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#12:1:A>
Uhm and it  ' s will it will become clear later

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#13:1:A>
The study that is now firmly reported was primarily inspired by his
works and uh the language diary which I will go in <?> detail </?> minute

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#14:1:A>
And this study has already appeared in IJB The International
Journal Bilingualism in the two issue of two thousand and two

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#15:1:A>
Uhm it is co-authored by A J A <unc> several words </unc>
who work as a research assistant on the project <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#16:1:A>
I would try to leave it by presentation to about fifteen minutes
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#17:1:A>
This is what happens uhm <,> uh something important matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#18:1:A>
Uh hoping to leave uhm what time for discussion later

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#19:1:A>
Uh however if there is anything unclear in the course of the
presentation please give me to uh raise question and I  ' ll try my best to
clarify <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#20:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#21:1:A>
Uh I would say a few words about current theories on code switching

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#22:1:A>
Uhm <,> many of the <,> current theories they focus on two major
types of motivation

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#23:1:A>
The first type is sociolinguistic

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#24:1:A>
The other is discourse related factors

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#25:1:A>
Some of the most important names uhm <,> regarding with here
raising of code switching

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#26:1:A>
Uhm they are <unc> two words </unc> on social motivation of
code switching and a number of other big names associated with conversation
and discourse and related factors of code switching

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#27:1:A>
They include John <?> Gambins </?> are are very <,> are widely
cited monograph uhm <,> published in nineteen eighty two called discourse
strategies

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#28:1:A>
And of course Peter <?> hour </?> uh nineteen eighty four eighty
eight ninety five ninety eight uh <?> on built </?> on John <?> Gambins ' </?>
work on code switching as essentially a <?> contextualization </?> clue in
conversation

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#29:1:A>
For example signalling a shift in topic or in <unc> one word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#30:1:A>
And of course it is <unc> one word </unc> who now works in
the UK

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#31:1:A>
Uh his book <,> thee generations two languages one family has
meanwhile become a classic <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#32:1:A>
He also <,> look at code switching similarly as in patronizing
patronizing a clue

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#33:1:A>
Uh for example signalling happens or is happens are using the same
or different language as used by the <unc> one word </unc> in the <,>
immediately <?> receiving </?> term

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#34:1:A>
Now what this mean is uhm <,> typically it involves uh a mother and
a child in conversation and the complex in which is made his research uh is
in the UK uh the place more specifically is <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#35:1:A>
Uh what he found is that very interestingly uh when a mother wants
to remind his child to work uh on his homework to try to complete work to try
to <?> involve </?> time to uh study

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#36:1:A>
Uh <,> typically the question is asked in Cantonese and
interestingly <?> deway </?> found that uhm

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#37:1:A>
With regard to the child  ' s response if the child <,> likes the
idea of the mother reminding him or her to do academic work uh or uhm if he
uh complies to the mother  ' s immediate reminder and therefore uh will turn
his attention her attention to uhm study

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#38:1:A>
Then he or she would use the same language which is Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#39:1:A>
But on the other hand if the child resist the idea of <,> study

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#40:1:A>
That is the mother wants me to study but I don't like the idea then
he would signal his <?> dispreference </?> by <,> responding in a <.> lo </.>
in another language which in this case is <,> English <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#41:1:A>
And I myself have done some work on code switching using uh Hong
Kong data

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#42:1:A>
Uhm in my own work I use Cantonese English code switching as data
and my work on code switching rule out of a modest attempt

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#43:1:A>
Uhm perhaps I can date back to about ten years ago uh in an attempt
to try to explain to City U students why Cantonese English code switching
occur so commonly in prestige of educated Hong Kong Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#44:1:A>
And in particular I wanted to see if it is possible to fix the
existing theories into our data

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#45:1:A>
That is to see to what extent the current theories at the time
could help us explain Cantonese English code switching behaviour uhm and I
<?> thinkly </?> came to the conclusion that the current theories at the time
uhm you know social motivation in particular

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#46:1:A>
They were not very <,> cause form very convincing in terms of
explaining the types of code switching that take place especially between
peers uh between colleagues in the workplace where vital or no negotiation of
identity is formed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#47:1:A>
And in my work data was collected from informal sections of the
Hong Kong Chinese press for over eighteen months and the details reported in
a monograph published nineteen ninety six

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#48:1:A>
The analysis let me to the observation that Cantonese English code
switching in Hong Kong is primarily motivated by a variety of practice of
essentially a linguistic or semantic paragraph in particular

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#49:1:A>
And I would elaborate on uh these concepts using illustrations of
uhm later on <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#50:1:A>
This is something that I  ' ve been foreseen and so <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#51:1:A>
I suppose <,> maybe some problem with the power I may have to use
the uh AC power <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#52:1:A>
So uhm <&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#53:1:A>
I think one explanation is that uhm I  ' m now operating with the
battery which is good for two hours

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#54:1:A>
I suspect that is because I have using at the same time I open all
different files uh which probably explain why uh battery runs out so quickly
<&> A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#55:1:A>
Maybe I could <?> some </?> <unc> one word </unc> <&> A
long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#56:1:A>
Right so we are back <unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#57:1:A>
Okay so the <,> concept that I came up with in my analysis they
include availability elsewhere refer to as lexical gap

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#58:1:A>
Specifically elsewhere refer to as <unc> one word </unc> in
conference

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#59:1:A>
And the principle of economy alternatively known as the principle
of these happen

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#60:1:A>
The analysis let me to believe further that the notion of
translation equipments across languages especially between Cantonese and
English and Chinese and English is <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#61:1:A>
Hence the conclusion that code switching between Cantonese and
English is more often than not

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#62:1:A>
Motivated consciously or subconsciously by a desire to avoid
unwanted semantic loss of mean <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#63:1:A>
I have a number of stock example that I would like to share with
you

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#64:1:A>
That is these are typical English expressions that occur in our
otherwise Cantonese conversation or discourses

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#65:1:A>
Uhm you can cite <,,> <unc> several words </unc> <&> A long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#66:1:A>
Okay I  ' m still on this page

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#67:1:A>
The stock examples those include uh noun and noun groups like happy
hour major speaker

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#68:1:A>
A word that we will see in our uh data the word email call
PowerPoint presentation and rave party

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#69:1:A>
And example of verb or verb groups are the verb book call clip keep
present check in upgrade and update

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#70:1:A>
Also as given has observe sometimes the English terms are
comfortably more safety that is they come to our mind faster simply because
these are the terms that are taught in school

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#71:1:A>
Hence the effect of learning as a result of English medium
instruction

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#72:1:A>
Uh and given uses is the term concept formation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#73:1:A>
Now in terms of shortcoming of previous approaches <,> in terms of
the methodological inadequacy uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#74:1:A>
The approaches mention <,> us now that is sociolinguistic discourse
related factors and the linguistic systematic motivations

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#75:1:A>
They share one feature in common uh which is the factor they are
all <?> premanenturing </?> or <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#76:1:A>
They are mainly theory written analysis after the act of code
switching

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#77:1:A>
So basically what the same here is we collect a body of data and
then we have find one particular theory in the hope of trying to account for
all the instances of code switching that we found meet the body later

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#78:1:A>
And <.> methodolog </.> methodologically there  ' s <?> discuss </?>
one risk and the risk had has been pointed it out in the literature is
motivational <?> stipulation </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#79:1:A>
That is different researchers they <?> stipulate </?> about
different motivations that uh uhm associated with certain instances of code
switching they observed being the data

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#80:1:A>
And of course there is a problem of the map of <?> crossal </?>
mind availability

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#81:1:A>
By that I mean uhm interestingly so many experts have said things
about code switching especially the reasons why people code switch

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#82:1:A>
But somehow the people who code switch themselves are maybe we can
all them code switchers they have no say

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#83:1:A>
I mean it seems that up to now no researchers has bother to check
with the code switchers themselves uh what was the reason why you code switch
here or there at this particular incident

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#84:1:A>
And this is what motivated me to look around for an alternative
methodology

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#85:1:A>
One that would allow the code switchers themselves to say where
when and why they code switch and when I come across the famous technique in
<unc> one word </unc> methodology known as revolution rule
destruction

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#86:1:A>
I said to myself <unc> one word </unc> I thought <&> A long
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#87:1:A>
Okay special interest in the methodologies of this study

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#88:1:A>
Now it makes use of that methodology called preparation rule
interruption and it presents the voices of twelve educated Hong Kong Chinese
bilinguals and their thought and feelings toward English Chinese code
switching

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#89:1:A>
Uh as mention it was inspired partly by John Gibbons language diary
study published nineteen eighty seven involving twenty seven Hong Kong U
students

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#90:1:A>
And uh <?> carry down </?> people abnormal methodological technique
call revolution rule disruption

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#91:1:A>
Uh what it means

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#92:1:A>
Revolution rule disruption would be uh <,> discuss <.> de </.> now

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#93:1:A>
What have I done <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#94:1:A>
And of course uh I don't know of course

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#95:1:A>
The way that I have <unc> one word </unc> this machine
device that collected that uh this is something very use indeed uh in uh
<unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#96:1:A>
My excuse in <unc> several words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#97:1:A>
Looks like I have found like <unc> several words </unc> <&>
A long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#98:1:A>
Right so I  ' ll check forty one indeed

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#99:1:A>
Okay the student participants for twelve of them they would oblige
to reflect on the nature and extend of their reminds on Cantonese English
code switching in a normal communication with others especially with friends
and peers and the possible reasons why code switching seem so difficult to
avoid

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#100:1:A>
Now twelve being causal student participants for part in the
experiment they were self selected responding to the <?> fingernail </?>
adverb

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#101:1:A>
Uh perhaps I don't need to go into the details

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#102:1:A>
The adverb mean uh require them to work on a number of tasks and
the task uhm the let the resulted in

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#103:1:A>
Uh the data presented in this paper are they were only part of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#104:1:A>
Uh in terms of gender distribution ten female students and two
male students aged nineteen to twenty six years old <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#105:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#106:1:A>
Profile of student participants uhm mother tongue Cantonese

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#107:1:A>
Uh number of years learning <.> Canton </.> uh learning English
sorry over fourteen years and English proficiency I will describe their <?>
English </?> proficiency as between upper intermediate and advance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#108:1:A>
Okay most of the participant are there was a full time RA

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#109:1:A>
In fact the RA uh contributed so much to the experiment to the
processing the data

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#110:1:A>
Uh it  ' s difficult not to include the name in the paper that  ' s
why she ended it up as co-author of the paper who name is <?> Kate Shin </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#111:1:A>
Uhm and the other eleven student participants they participated in
their capacity as part time student helpers which entitled them some more
disturb information

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#112:1:A>
Uh if any of them had any overseas studying or living experience
uh one female student uh coded as F three in the you know student three uh
spend a few years who refused to say exactly how many years but she will she
said at least uh for three years I will guess in an anglophone country

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#113:1:A>
Uh she took a degree from a an anglophone country that allow me to
use that she must have spent at least three years overseas there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#114:1:A>
Okay if they study any courses in sociolinguistics or bilingualism
uh with the exception of the co-author

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#115:1:A>
None of the other student participants has studied any courses in
this area

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#116:1:A>
Now this one is important because uh we rely on self recorded data

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#117:1:A>
If they have been exposed to many of the discussions in code
switching code mixing and so on then the discussion might have influence
their own thinking

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#118:1:A>
The <.> re </.> uh possible result would be that the uh might had
simply <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#119:1:A>
Uh we see wisdom uh that they heard or read in textbooks

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#120:1:A>
Uh so apart from the co-author uhm none of the other student
helpers or student participants has studied courses in sociolinguistics or
bilingualism <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#121:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#122:1:A>
Two kinds work of <?> quantitated </?> data we use in this study

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#123:1:A>
The first kind is language dairies

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#124:1:A>
Uhm uh what happen was

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#125:1:A>
The students were asked not to use English for one day and the all
the <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#126:1:A>
Uh they were instructed to uh find tone the data by consolidating
the information they put down on the <unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#127:1:A>
Uh well uh other word <.> pro </.> <unc> one word </unc> I
think so

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#128:1:A>
This is the <unc> one word </unc> that I am referring to

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#129:1:A>
And each of them receive a soft copy of it right <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#130:1:A>
And if you compare this <unc> one word </unc> with page
eighteen of John Gibbons ' book you find twenty of similarities

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#131:1:A>
Right page eighteen uhm nineteen to twenty one

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#132:1:A>
A lot of the uh design uh was inspired by John Gibbons ' home diary
studies <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#133:1:A>
Right then the second type of data consists of transcriptions of
focus group interviews

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#134:1:A>
Uhm more on this data nineteen participants took place uh people
far of this <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#135:1:A>
Experiment itself all student participants were instructed <,> not
to use any English for one day

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#136:1:A>
To record exact quote of English words that they wanted to use but
do not using a <unc> one word </unc> that is the one resort

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#137:1:A>
And to share and discuss their feelings in a focus group interview
two days after the experiment

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#138:1:A>
I still remember it was <unc> two words <unc> two thousand
uh when we were asked to uh perform this time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#139:1:A>
Before that three hour three thing and training was provided <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#140:1:A>
The purpose of the <unc> one word <unc> was to record key
factory information whose makes what to whom when and where

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#141:1:A>
And uh <?> finding </?> notes and feelings and filling in missing
details before going to there that is uh they were given the instructions
that they all

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#142:1:A>
They get some of the rich important details during the day

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#143:1:A>
They had to use the <unc> one word <unc> to guide them and
filling the uh missing information before going to there

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#144:1:A>
And within twenty four hours they were asked to submit a soft copy
of a two page reflected dairy explaining their own thought and feelings about
uh what happen you know

<ICE-HK:S2A-049#145:1:A>
That is being artificially prevented from using English for twenty
four or the same or twelve hours </I>
