Dear Simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#10:2>
Hello .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#11:2>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#12:2>
I am fine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#13:2>
I decided to go to Europe this summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#14:2>
Unluckily , we cannot join together for fun .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#15:2>
It is a pity , anyway .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#16:2>
Properly , Greece will be our first destination .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#17:2>
Then , by flight to Austria or other places .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#18:2>
But , I  ' d like to go to Italy which many people claimed dangerous .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#19:2>
We form a all-gal group .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#20:2>
See our power .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#21:2>
We will finish our trip without any mistakes .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#22:2>
See how powerful the PPVIC training is . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#23:2>
Right now , my problem is to make money .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#24:2>
Therefore , I will have an interview tomorrow in Quarry Bay .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#25:2>
It is SRH .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#26:2>
I hope the job will give me enough &ldquo; Water &rdquo; for the trip .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#27:2>
Otherwise , I have to borrow some from mom &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#28:2>
that I definitely don't want .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#29:2>
I am 21 now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#30:2>
Travelling is a luxury that is not supposed to be a burden to my
parent .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#31:2>
In last winter holiday , they afford my trip to Beijing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#32:2>
Moreover , I asked my mom to afford my study in China after
graduation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#33:2>
She does not object or accept .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#34:2>
Properly , it is okay . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#35:2>

Dear Katy and Simmy and all other dear gals ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#39:3>
Long time no see too !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#40:3>
I know you all miss me soooooooooooo muuuuuuuuuuch .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#41:3>
So do I.

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#42:3>
My plan to Europe is going to be fine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#43:3>
Thanks for asking !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#44:3>
Ha Ha !

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#45:3>
I am sure from Jose. , you probably know we  ' ll take Gulf Air on
6/15 to Cairo .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#46:3>
On the same flight , there will be more than 20 HKUST fellows .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#47:3>
We all go to Muscat and interchange other flights to different
destinations .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#48:3>
We  ' ll also have a free hotel room after arriving Muscat cos it takes
more than 6 hours to wait for another flight .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#49:3>
See !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#50:3>
My plan is fine . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#51:3>
When will you leave for Germany ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#52:3>
I think it is good to meet you in Germany if possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#53:3>
Perhaps , you can leave the telephone &hash; and address for your
parents and ask them to phone my parents so that I can know where all yr guys
are .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#54:3>
Good plan !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#55:3>
Well done !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#56:3>
Barbara !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#57:3>
You are so Marvelous ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#58:3>
Any news abt all you guys ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#59:3>
This semester can kill .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#60:3>
I have so many group projects which I hate most .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#61:3>
I prefer individual work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#62:3>
You know 1&plus;1 sometimes not equal to 2 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#63:3>
There are some disgusting free-riders .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#64:3>
Moreover , meeting is only for blowing water .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#65:3>
We cannot reach anything during meetings .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#66:3>
waste time ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#67:3>
I try so hard to find a part-time job but in vain cos my time
table is so bad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#68:3>
No free am/pm !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#69:3>
It <-> ocuppies </-> <+> occupies </+> me all day long with break <->
inbetween </-> <+> in between </+> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#70:3>
On Sat. , I have a tutorial with a 4 yr gal for 3 hrs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#71:3>
We just play !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#72:3>
But it is under great pressure cos her mom watches us .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#73:3>
If I can find a better job , I will quit this boring and fairly paid
job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#74:3>
&dollar;70/hr.

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#75:3>
This week takes my breath away .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#76:3>
Every day , I have to hand in <-> ASS----ignment </-> <+> assignment
</+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#77:3>
I have to read a lot of articles .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#78:3>
I take an Econ course that is for year 3 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#79:3>
This course worries me so much !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#80:3>
no bk , no notes , only more than 50 reserved articles in lib .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#81:3>
Of course , I am not that stupid to read them all .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#82:3>
But it really takes time to just take a look on the contents .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#83:3>
The yr 3 students are hardworking .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#84:3>
I don't want to &ldquo; <indig> Gel </indig> &ldquo; this year ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#85:3>
By the way , every Wed morning &obrack; 9:00 &cbrack; , I will
log in in the network for lab session of Bus. Info. Sym that is computer
stuff .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#86:3>
So do send me mail before Wed so that I can reply you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#87:3>
I  ' ll also log in when I do the HW .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#88:3>
If you send me mail this wk. , probably , I  ' ll reply soon as I have
to do a lot of work on computer these days . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#89:3>
Okay , almost 11:30am I have to back to classroom and have 2 hour
sleeping before lunch .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#90:3>
See u guys !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#91:3>

Dear Simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#94:4>
This is a very sad news to know yr friend has passed away .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#95:4>
Anyway , it is fate .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#96:4>
I believe everyone has a terminal assigned .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#97:4>
We do not know when we  ' ll leave for heaven &obrack; not go down
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#98:4>
Just to enjoy as much as you can right now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#99:4>
Okay ! Come on !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#100:4>
Let  ' s have fun in Europe ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#101:4>
I will study in Beijing/Shanghai after my graduation for 1/2
years for Mandarin .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#102:4>
Just a rough idea .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#103:4>
I  ' ll try to find more info. after the Easter break .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#104:4>
To tell more later .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#105:4>
I think it is better to study Mandarin in China where I can practise
more .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#106:4>
The fee and living expense is low . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#107:4>
Have <-> your </-> <+> you </+> read my previous LONG mail ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#108:4>
Hope so .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#109:4>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#134:7>
Keep up !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#135:7>
You may consult your hair stylist Ah Lone in order to get some

We are looking forward to that ...

I haven't contacted Siu Fa thro ' e-mail for quite a long time , but
I ve talked to her in the phone .

reply you ! </I>

Dear Simmy ,

I succeed in using this e-mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#144:8>
How intelligent I am !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#145:8>
I was happy to meet you yesterday though you  ' re not really in mood !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#146:8>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#147:8>
And even if you can't , remember , I will be on your side &obrack;
in spirit &cbrack; to support you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#148:8>
This is the final year that we are in our own universities , I think
both of us should really make good use of this last year to enjoy what we
should have the life of university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#149:8>
So , besides playing , do stay more time in your library walk around
in the campus , eat at the canteen , play more sports , ... etc . so that you
can have more memories on your fee !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#150:8>
Is it boring !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#151:8>
Actually , I don't know what I  ' m talking about .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#152:8>
Anyway , please call me or send mails to me when you  ' re free .

Dear Simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#160:9>
I am sorry that I could not reply u as soon as I can .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#161:9>
This is because my e-mail acct was down for I saved too many mails
so that the memory is not sufficient to run e-mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#162:9>
Understand ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#163:9>
How  ' s life in HKU ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#164:9>
comfortable !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#165:9>
I am very busy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#166:9>
This fri I am going to have mid-term exam on China tax law .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#167:9>
It  ' s pretty hard .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#168:9>
Moreover , I have to hand in my paper <-> aand </-> <+> and </+> one
case studies <-> neext </-> <+> next </+> tue .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#169:9>
And have a quiz on <-> Weed </-> <+> Wed </+> and may have a quiz on

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#170:9>
However , because of the China Law , I hv not prepared the quiz yet .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#171:9>
It is very late at night but I still have to go on memorizing China
Law .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#172:9>
Damn it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#173:9>
What do u suggest doing on our gatherings on the first Sunday next

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#174:9>
Have u listened to the song sung by Sandy Lam &ldquo; Naked Secret
&rdquo; , the drama version with Leslie as the narrator ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#175:9>
His voice is too unbearably .................. SEXY .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#176:9>

Dear Simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#182:10>
I am concerned abt my career too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#183:10>
I hope that I can enter Cathay Pacific to <-> ave </-> <+> have
</+> very low price of tickets to go all over the wld .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#184:10>
What field are u intersted in ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#185:10>
I also hope to enter Banking as I can have a comprehensive training
when I am at probation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#186:10>
This helps a lot .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#187:10>
But working in these organizations means hard promotion .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#188:10>
I have also apply for govt posts , EO and some other .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#189:10>
In Dec. , there will be a common exam for those applicants of govt
posts .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#190:10>
The exam includes Chinese , English and Statistics .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#191:10>
I really have to study before exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#192:10>
Are yr photos taken in Europe okay ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#193:10>
Later , let  ' s share our experience and &ldquo; appreciate &rdquo;
the photos together .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#194:10>
Okay ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#195:10>
But when ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#196:10>
Who knows ? </p>

Dear Simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#201:11>
Time flies .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#202:11>
This is the real time we have to think abt our career .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#203:11>
We thought about it in F5 and F7 but not much thought .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#204:11>
Now , we have to face it head-to-head .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#205:11>
Do u feel time flies ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#206:11>
I do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#207:11>
What makes me feel uncomfortable is I have to leave school &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#208:11>
may or may not be ever .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#209:11>
I like schooling as it is care-free despite heavy school work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#210:11>
I can live in way I wish esp when I <?> stay </? > in hall .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#211:11>
Nine to <-> fine </-> <+> five </+> confines .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#212:11>
Moreover , I really become mature .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#213:11>
I can no longer ask my mom for financial support .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#214:11>
U see , I always run a deficit budget .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#215:11>
There is no longer an excuse &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#216:11>
we are still young and we are students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#217:11>
Fault may not be allowed or easily forgiven by yr boss .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#218:11>
I hope that u can enjoy more while you are still a student .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#219:11>
We can no longer have favourable fare to take MTR after graduation .

Recently , the first batch of UST UG collected their caps and gowns .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#221:11>
I imagined how I will look like next yr .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#222:11>
Well , the closer to the graduation , the more I like and treasure
schooling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#223:11>
I took photos with Jose .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#224:11>
Perhaps she did not duplicate the photos and just give us the
original so she do not have group photos .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#225:11>
So bad !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#226:11>
By the way , though I was angry with her a mth ago , it was okay
now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#227:11>
After all , we are PPVIC sisters coming from the same sky . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#228:11>
I also hoped to be a successful executive but not that &ldquo; iron
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#229:11>
Where is Katy ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#230:11>
ask her if she receive my mail.

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#231:11>
See u !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#232:11>
Love

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#236:12>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#237:12>
I hope it  ' ll be nice !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#238:12>
I  ' m very busy doing my assignments now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#239:12>
I always don't have enough sleep .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#240:12>
Very tired , indeed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#241:12>
Of course , I <-> / m </-> <+> am </+> busy watching Leon  ' s
programme every night as well !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#242:12>
It  ' s very funny and he  ' s very smart .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#243:12>
You must agree .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#244:12>
I have especial feelings when watching this program cos he is a
teacher and i  ' m going to be a teacher too , you know .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#245:12>
I hope my students are not as <-> naught </-> <+> naughty </+> as
those on the TV when I have my practice teaching next month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#246:12>
I will be very scared of them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#247:12>
Pray for me then . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#248:12>
ok .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#249:12>
I am going to have my lunch now and reply me when you  ' re free .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#250:12>
Bye-Bye.

Dear Simmy ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#253:13>
You gals are so lucky .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#254:13>
HKU is always the first to be approached .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#255:13>
I took a look of the schedule for recruitement talks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#256:13>
Cathay Pacific only posts Pilot .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#257:13>
No mgmt trainees .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#258:13>
Anyway , I shall try to apply for a job in Cathay which is my
destination .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#259:13>
Love,

Dear gals ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#262:14>
Last sat. , I saw <-> Arron  ' s </-> <+> Aaron  ' s </+> concert .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#263:14>
It was quite gd .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#264:14>
The only thing I complained was he spent too much time on changing
clothes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#265:14>
I also got the application form of Cathay Mgmt trainee .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#266:14>
The offer is really attractive .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#267:14>
The renumeration is high too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#268:14>
Moreover , I love training .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#269:14>
It is a honey-moon period .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#270:14>
But their requirements were quite harsh .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#271:14>
What brand of handbag you gals <-> recommand </-> <+> recommend
</+> ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#272:14>
No M duck , No Polo , No Burberry , No LV !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#273:14>
What do u think ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#274:14>

simmy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#278:15>
Thanks a lot with your message and your invitation on Leon  ' s
concert .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#279:15>
I am really <-> co's </-> <+> cos </+> I don't need to find a place
to hide myself on x'mas eve - an important day ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#280:15>
At this moment , I am very busy to have my practice teaching in
causeway bay .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#281:15>
I am so tired to get up at 5:45am .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#282:15>
every morning .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#283:15>
But I have to be <-> punual </-> <+> punctual </+> !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#284:15>
On the whole , I am quite satisfied with my students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#285:15>
Of course , 2 or 3 of them are much talkative , but they are not
naughty and they can be controlled .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#286:15>
Luckily , i  ' ve passed a week there and I don't have any bitter
experience <-> uptil </-> <+> up till </+> now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#287:15>
However , I am quite disappointed with the teachers  '  teaching
method and their attitudes there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#288:15>
I don't know if you understand or not .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#289:15>
but anyway , I have I found many things that i  ' ve learnt in school
are too realistic and could not be applied there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#290:15>
Also , students there are of very low level ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#291:15>
I can't use english only to teach them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#292:15>
I must mix with cantonese ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#293:15>
that  ' s what I don't want .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#294:15>
And when I teach there , I always think back on our school-life in
PPVIC .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#295:15>
How quiet , nice and good to our teachers at that time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#296:15>
Perhaps , I am old now and I don't really understand <-> nowsdays  ' 
</-> <+> nowadays  '  </+> students very much .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#297:15>
you can't expect that they asked me &lsquo; miss Lam , how much is
your swatch ? &rsquo; in my first lesson; or &lsquo; Is your boyfriend  ' s
letter ? &rsquo; etc .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#298:15>
Did we dare to talk to our teachers in PPVIC in this way in the
past ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#299:15>
But sometimes , they are quite cute and interesting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#300:15>
If I <-> star </-> <+> stare </+> at them or scold them , they
would become quiet again . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-011#301:15>
Ok !

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#302:15>
I must go now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#303:15>
By the way , will you go to have the exam on 3/12 &obrack; gov't
post &cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#304:15>
Where will u go ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#305:15>
I  ' ll have the exam in <-> kwoon tong </-> <+> Kwun Tong </+> but I
don't know how to get there ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#306:15>
keep sending me messages ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-011#307:15>
I must read them .
