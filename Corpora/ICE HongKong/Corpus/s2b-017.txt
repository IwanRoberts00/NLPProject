Good Evening

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#2:1:A>
Hanoi has agreed to take back up to fifteen hundred Vietnamese
boatpeople from Hong Kong each month <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#3:1:A>
That  ' s according to a member of an Omelco group currently on a
fact-finding tour of Vietnam <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#4:1:A>
Returning to Hong Kong ahead of her Omelco colleagues <,> Legislator
Peggy Lam said starting in July Hanoi is prepared to receive up to six
flights of two hundred and fifty boatpeople each month <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#5:1:A>
That  ' s fifteen hundred compared with the peak return from Hong Kong
of fourteen hundred boatpeople last November <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#6:1:A>
Lam quoted Hanoi officials and say they too are eager to accept even
more returnees but would need money to build new transit centres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#7:1:A>
There  ' s also talk now of sending the boatpeople back in ships in
the future <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#8:1:A>
Problems still plague the returnees according to Lam <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#9:1:A>
The unemployment which drove many of them to flee in the first place
<,> still dogs them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#10:1:A>
But international aid programs are helping train returnees in new
skills and loaning them money to start businesses <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#11:1:A>
The United States has relaxed its ban on UNHCR to spend its
donations on Vietnam and the expected lifting of the US trade embargo next
year will be a big economic boost <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#12:1:A>
Rehousing returnees and educating their children are other problems
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#13:1:A>
And Lam was told of a fourth <,> sexual diseases among female
returnees <,> which Vietnamese officials said reflected the promiscuous life
in Hong Kong  ' s boatpeople camps <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#14:1:A>
Lam said all concerned were relieved <?> that </?> only seven
boatpeople had fled to Hong Kong this year <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#15:1:A>
To further alleviate the problem <,> Hanoi urged Hong Kong people
to invest in Vietnam <,> preferably in joint venture factories <,> textiles
for example in less developed Northern Vietnam <O> Report by Keith Carls </O>

Speaking at a One-country-two-systems seminar New China News
Agency Deputy Director Cheung <?> Wah </?> said the Basic Law is the only
guarantee for a smooth transfer of government in nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#17:1:B>
Any attempt to negate the Basic Law he said is childish and
laughable <O> Speech by the China Agency Deputy Director in Cantonese </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-017#18:1:B>
In the last five years of the transition period Cheung said
the most important thing is to put Hong Kong on the path to convergence with
the Basic Law <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#19:1:B>
Another speaker Chinese legal expert and a Basic Law drafter <?>
Xiao Wei Yuen </?> said in the run-up to nineteen ninety-seven everything
should go by the law

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#20:1:B>
The formation of the first SAR Government is written in the Basic
Law and endorsed by the Chinese National People  ' s Congress <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#21:1:B>
<?> Xiao </?> added that the law has legal binding in Hong Kong as
well as in China <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#22:1:B>
Both Cheung and <?> Xiao </?> were referring to advocates of faster
political reforms

<ICE-HK:S2B-017#23:1:B>
They urged Hong Kong people to study carefully the Basic Law in
preparation for the transition <,>
