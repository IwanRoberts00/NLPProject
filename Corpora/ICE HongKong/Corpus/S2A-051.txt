<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-051#1:1:A>
Jeff just told me that we missed <,> someone from marketing uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#2:1:A>
<unc> several-words </unc> here Anita Ma

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#3:1:A>
In fact she is part of our P and G <,> uh life right now

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#4:1:A>
She is working part time in P and G <,> so you can ask her after the
whole presentation <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#5:1:A>
Ok for brand or sometimes we call it marketing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#6:1:A>
What is our mission <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#7:1:A>
Our mission is to build growing profitable and sustainable brand
franchise <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#8:1:A>
What does it mean <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#9:1:A>
It means doing everything required to build healthy profitable and
long-term brand business <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#10:1:A>
Doing it better than competitors and <,,> contribute to a long-term
business goal for the total company <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#11:1:A>
To achieve this mission we must have the people <,> so our second
mission to develop leadership skill of our people so they can become
outstanding brand manager <,> and who can make important contribution to the
business <,> and take on increasing responsibility and one day become general
manager <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#12:1:A>
There are a lot of things that we are doing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#13:1:A>
Uh first thing is brand concept

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#14:1:A>
We will develop brand concept like two-in-one shampoo and position
our brand in the marketplace for maximum long-term advantage <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#15:1:A>
Once we have the brand concept we  ' ll work with the advertising
agency <,> and develop excellent TV copy and then we put impactful media
weight behind it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#16:1:A>
Furthermore we  ' ll have world class packaging for our P and G
quality product <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#17:1:A>
And finally <,,> we  ' ll propose pricing <,> promotion <,> and
merchandizing plans to achieve our consumer trial and loyalty objective or
trade support and display <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#18:1:A>
Ok <,> let me tell you some of the things that we really done <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#19:1:A>
I will like to show you two TV copies and then you tell me which
one you like or you enjoy looking at <,> okay <&> speaker-shows-tv-adverts
</&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#20:1:A>
Johnson and Johnson <,> please raise your hand

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#21:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#22:1:A>
Rejoice for kids <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#23:1:A>
Uh it is surprising <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#24:1:A>
Well but maybe you are adults <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#25:1:A>
You are not kids anymore

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#26:1:A>
Uh doesn't matter

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#27:1:A>
There is no true or wrong answer

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#28:1:A>
The reason I  ' m going to I just show you these two copies that the
Rejoice for kids commercial is part of our main duty

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#29:1:A>
As the brand or marketing people we have to develop excellent TV
copy to communicate our brand  ' s benefit or positioning <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#30:1:A>
Let me ask you one more question

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#31:1:A>
What is the benefit that we promise in the Rejoice kids TV copy
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#32:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#33:1:A>
Well maybe I will answer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#34:1:A>
The answer is in one step kids  '  hair is soft without tears <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#35:1:A>
Let me show you one more TV copy maybe you will be more interested
in looking at uh especially for the ladies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#36:1:A>
This <?> is a </?> copy in a very different category

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#37:1:A>
Cosmetic <&> speaker-shows-tv-adverts </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#38:1:A>
Twenty-four hours whiten your skin <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#39:1:A>
Okay that  ' s all the TV copy that I have to show you

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#40:1:A>
If you want to look at more TV copy either you join P and G or you
go home and watch television <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#41:1:A>
Okay next is about the career path in marketing <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#42:1:A>
Once you join P and G you  ' ll be a <,> brand assistant in the
marketing department

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#43:1:A>
As a brand assistant <,> uh the title may not be that good but it
is equivalent to assistant product manager in the other companies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#44:1:A>
As a brand assistant you  ' ll be responsible for proposing and
executing promotion independently <,> and furthermore managing a huge
marketing budget <,> on your own

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#45:1:A>
Of course there will be training <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#46:1:A>
There will be training about corporation P and G way of doing
things like memo writing and <.> ch </.> communication <,> and furthermore
there will be functional training on marketing <,> like looking at TV copy
storyboard or media training

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#47:1:A>
In addition which I think is the most important part of it is
training and coaching <?> from </?> the brand manager <,> because we as brand
managers we are responsible to make sure you will succeed in P and G <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#48:1:A>
With strong performance you will be promoted to advertising manager
and may even be eventually promoted to general manager of a country <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#49:1:A>
That  ' s all about brand or advertising <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#50:1:A>
Next I will pass to Jeff Tang to talk about sales </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-051#51:2:A>
Thank you Jeff <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#52:2:A>
Well before I start my presentations <,> can anybody make a try to
make a guess what on earth is finance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#53:2:A>
Now uh our department is called Finance and Accounting so in short
these folks normally calls us F and A <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#54:2:A>
But can anybody try attempt to make a guess what on earth <.> fi
</.> finance do <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#55:2:A>
Any guess

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#56:2:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#57:2:A>
We count money every single day iron money notes <,> go out to the
stock market and <,> trade gamble <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#58:2:A>
Steven

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#59:2:A>
Yes managing credit definitely <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#60:2:A>
Sure you are from Sales so you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#61:2:A>
Well okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#62:2:A>
Now just imagine you uhm you find uh you want to have uh your own
company and also imagine that you  ' ve <.> ha </.> already had a good product

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#63:2:A>
You have good guys like Howard <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#64:2:A>
He has drawn up an excellent advertising campaign for you to sell
this product and you also have help from excellent people such as Jeff and
his team to help the merchandise it how to distribute it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#65:2:A>
Now the next question is how much am I going to sell this product
for <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#66:2:A>
How much money will I make <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#67:2:A>
When can I expand <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#68:2:A>
How much money do I need in in the first place to start up this
business <,> etcetera <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#69:2:A>
Now all of these questions are finance <?> come into play </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#70:2:A>
We answer all these questions and a whole lot more

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#71:2:A>
Uh the Finance Department or the F and A Department depends on how
they want to call us uhm we are the department that helps to form uh think of
plan how to sell a product uhm profitably <,> and we also participate in
drawing up plans and strategies of of the company <,> with the help uh from
our dear colleagues from the other departments <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#72:2:A>
Now all these I can summarize it into our mission statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#73:2:A>
Finance is the only department that has to consistently uh be
involved and make sure that the company  ' s return on assets is maximized

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#74:2:A>
Maximize the <.> bene </.> the benefits and the returns to our
shareholders <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#75:2:A>
Now the uh Finance and Accounting Department is split into two
sections <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#76:2:A>
Uh one section is called well as the name tells it it  ' s accounting

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#77:2:A>
Accounting is well what do accounting do <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#78:2:A>
Do you know what accounting is

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#79:2:A>
Well <.> accou </.> uh accounting sections they keep tab of our
financial statements internal control treasuries and of course safeguard of
the company  ' s assets <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#80:2:A>
Another sections then is the uh Financial Analysis Sections

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#81:2:A>
If you join us then you will start at the Financial Analysis
Sections

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#82:2:A>
So the next question you probably that you ask is so what will I do
if I join the F and A Department <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#83:2:A>
Well there  ' s a quite a lot of projects that we often involved but
uh I can summarize it into five main areas <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#84:2:A>
And the first area is goal setting for the company and target
setting

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#85:2:A>
Uh this is where uh we set up profit and volume targets for the
company for the coming years <,> with input from the other departments <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#86:2:A>
The purpose of this exercise is <,,> planning

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#87:2:A>
Well why do I need planning <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#88:2:A>
Well Michael <unc> 1-word </unc> will tell you why you need
planning <,> but uh one of the main reason is we want to make sure that the
whole or every department in the company is keeping the focus on the same
projects that will ensure we continually <.> de </.> deliver profits to the
company <,> and Finance is the only department that  ' s heavily involved in uh
long-term planning <,> and strategic planning of where we want to go how much
are we going to make what are we going to sell <,> how much are we going to
sell <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#89:2:A>
The next area is profit forecast and control <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#90:2:A>
Now after you have set your target then what  ' s the next thing

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#91:2:A>
Then you have to deliver it otherwise there  ' s no <?> sense </?> of
<.> set </.> setting a target

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#92:2:A>
Uhm in order to do this whoever is the forecaster as we normally
call it has to have excellent knowledge of what  ' s going on in the business
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#93:2:A>
That means both inside and outside of the company <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#94:2:A>
What  ' s <.> happenin </.> what  ' s the companies doing

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#95:2:A>
What are our strategies

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#96:2:A>
What are our plans

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#97:2:A>
What are our strengths and weaknesses

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#98:2:A>
And what  ' s happening outside in the business environment

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#99:2:A>
How are our competitors reacting

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#100:2:A>
How do the consumers react to whatever plan that we have drawn up
to <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#101:2:A>
The third one is cost control

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#102:2:A>
This is especially crucial for an operation such as Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#103:2:A>
Now when I talk cost control I mean two things

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#104:2:A>
First of all of course it  ' s my product <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#105:2:A>
Now for Hong Kong why is that it  ' s important because Hong Kong
import hundred percent of all the products that we sell <,> starting from
Pampers Whisper our shampoos all the way to cosmetics

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#106:2:A>
Now in here we have to work very closely with our suppliers most
of them are foreign suppliers

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#107:2:A>
Make sure we <.> under </.> the understand the cost structures and
make sure that we can have we can lower our costs and at the same time have
good quality products <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#108:2:A>
Now this is first aspect of cost control

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#109:2:A>
The second aspect is to how do I cost control our own operating
cost such as uhm my working <.> sis </.> uhm our work system

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#110:2:A>
In here then representatives from our department will have to work
closely with other departments <,> uhm to <,> maximize our efficiency and to
lower our uh operating costs <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#111:2:A>
The fourth area is investment <.> in </.> analysis

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#112:2:A>
I  ' m sure all of you will be very familiar with this

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#113:2:A>
This basically means feasibility study <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#114:2:A>
For example I have an excellent product here <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#115:2:A>
Shall I launch it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#116:2:A>
Shall I not launch it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#117:2:A>
Now if I decided to launch it how am I going to launch it

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#118:2:A>
At what price am I going sell

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#119:2:A>
What is the reasonable price level

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#120:2:A>
What is the reasonable profit level

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#121:2:A>
This is where we come uh come into play <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#122:2:A>
And the last aspect is <?> competitive </?> analysis

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#123:2:A>
Uhm I  ' ve talked about this briefly <,> uh a while ago

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#124:2:A>
That means I need to understand what my competitors doing and a
broad view

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#125:2:A>
What are the strengths and weaknesses <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#126:2:A>
What are the strategic emphasis right now

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#127:2:A>
For example are they into detergents

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#128:2:A>
Are they into shampoo or what are the categories that they are
into right now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#129:2:A>
Now so this is very broad view of <,> the tasks that we uh the
Finance Department mainly concentrate on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#130:2:A>
Uhm <,,> when you join us as I said you will join the Financial
Analysis Section and start as an Financial Analyst <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#131:2:A>
Uhm <,> here you gain the technical expertise of finance and as
you progress you will <.> ho </.> have a more challenging task and you become
the F and A Manager or the Finance and Accounting Manager

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#132:2:A>
That means this person will be in charge of the whole Financing
and Accounting Department of the <.> o </.> of a country such as for example
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#133:2:A>
Now here as Raymond said the timing is not fixed

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#134:2:A>
It all depends on your performance <?> and </?> but you can be
rest assured that uhm experienced Finance Managers will be available all the
times to make sure that you maximize your development <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#135:2:A>
Now how far you go how fast you go is only depend on you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#136:2:A>
The results that you deliver the contributions you contribute to
the company <,> and your own performance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#137:2:A>
Now with this I would like to pass on to Raymond again to <.> cri
</.> uh to briefly discuss the other departments that we have in P and G </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-051#138:3:A>
I  ' m let me introduce myself first

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#139:3:A>

from architectural engineering and construction business in Hong Kong and
they carry a lot of uh hardware software products

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#147:3:A>
And part of the the the the the software they want to to talk
about today is two things <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#148:3:A>
One is the <?> hyper </?> CAD technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-051#149:3:A>

electronic file formats you need some way to manage your files <,>
