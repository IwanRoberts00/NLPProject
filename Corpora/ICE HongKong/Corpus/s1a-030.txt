I can go where I want as long as I put in my twenty four hours in
ASM as long as I you know so it  ' s up to me what I do

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X115:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> Do you know what I mean so I quite </[2> like it

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X357:1:Z>
And then that one was that one was another it  ' s not quite a
dissertation

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X358:1:Z>
<{> <[> It  ' s not </[> as long I think it  ' s only about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-030#359:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#360:1:A>
But uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X361:1:Z>
Five thousand or six thousand words <{> <[> whereas </[>
dissertation is like ten or twelve I think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-030#362:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#363:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#364:1:A>
But is it is it hard to link to think of an to an an an idea to
<{> <[> uhm <,> </[> <&> tut </&> on perfumes and the <{> <[> sexual imagery
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X365:1:Z>
<[> Yeah very </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X366:1:Z>
<[> Oh no </[> </{> no no not at all I mean that once you start
<,> <{1> <[1> once once </[1> once you decided what you are going to do I
mean basically what happen to me was I  ' m I  ' m obsessed with magazine

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X367:1:Z>
I just think and the the most fantastic form of medium and
communication and that just I just love them <{2> <[2> because </[2> they are
so uhm accessible <{3> <[3> and </[3> and they are a bit not the daily
newspaper which get thrown away

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X368:1:Z>
People keep magazines <{4> <[4> and yet </[4> they still got the
same quality you can just take up them to read and then put down and then a
week later with a different feature and <{5> <[5> I just think they </[5> are
wonderful

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X369:1:Z>
Anyway so I want I knew I knew I had to do something with
magazines <{6> <[6> <,> </[6> so I was looking through then

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X370:1:Z>
I  ' m sort of looking through the adverts and notes changes in the
adverts and then as as the time went on and I have things changed and have
fashion about blah blah blah blah

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X371:1:Z>
So I just went write on to that and adventure I just sort of
<unc> one-word </unc> I know of the of stick perfume <{8> <[8> <,>
</[8> because it a luxury good luxury item

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X372:1:Z>
So it  ' s quite to write about things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X373:1:Z>
It  ' s quite easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X374:1:Z>
You know it  ' s just basic <?> wear of men </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-030#375:1:A>
<[1> Is it difficult </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#376:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#377:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#378:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#379:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#380:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-030#384:1:A>
The bottle of the perfumes I think they are fascinating <{>
<[> <?> cos </?> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X385:1:Z>
<[> They </[> </{> are quite decorative aren't they <{1> <[1>
most </[1> of them <{2> <[2> yeah </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X386:1:Z>
But I I didn't really look in to that very much

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X387:1:Z>
I mean I did obviously I mentioned it but I didn't sort of like
dwelled on it

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X388:1:Z>
This is really funny like basically in like the eighties when you
know the early eighties when Aids really sort hit like New York and London
and when everyone was like uh more I mean it was <unc> a few words
</unc> write longer than that but but when you know hit mainstream what
mainstream the world knew about it uh you know the influence it had on the on
the advertisement the <{3> <[3> time it </[3> was incredible you know
everyone would be so overtly sex use so much <{4> <[4> sexuality because
</[4> because they didn't want to promote this of Aids and everyone you <{5>
<[5> know I </[5> think it  ' s like that you know you you sort of look at it
from like a social point of view

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X389:1:Z>
You think what was happening at the time <{2> <[2> what was going
on </[2> and that  ' s the fact

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X390:1:Z>
Yeah I did notice the way influence each other and has some <{6>
<[6> really </[6> interactive and that  ' s is basically that just an example

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-030#447:1:A>
But you are interested in journalism

freelance-wise I mean or <{3> <[3> <.> temp </.> </[3> temporality

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X453:1:Z>
I mean for example if I was in London you know I could I could be
a secretary if I had no you know what I  ' m saying if you only got like six
weeks to make some money <{4> <[4> and </[4> whatever just get a part-time
temporary job and <?> other type </?> whereas in Hong Kong I couldn't do that
because <{5> <[5> the only </[5> the only there  ' s not not so many sort of
<unc> one-word </unc> sort of things that I can do apart from write
uhm style you know it has to be sort of media-related <{6> <[6> really </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-030#X454:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> You </[1> know that  ' s not you can't really get
temporary jobs there because of the language barrier <unc> two-words
