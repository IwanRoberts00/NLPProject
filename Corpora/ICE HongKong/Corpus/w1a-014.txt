Peter Maxwell Davies was born on 1934 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#2:1>
He is a English composer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#3:1>
During his time , he had a great achievement on the music drama .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#4:1>
Especially on the parody .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#5:1>
<del> 3-characters </del> With his successfully on parody , it makes
the music drama <del> has a </del> opening a new pages .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#6:1>
And in the following we will have on his theatre &ldquo; Eight songs
for a mad king &rdquo; to see how he uses <del> with </del> with the <del>
<.> pora </.> </del> parody <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> and </del>
and the great achievement in Music drama . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#7:1>
Firstly , we must need to understand what is the meaning of
&ldquo; Parody &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#8:1>
By Michael Tilmouth , he defined that compositional techniques use
with the <del> pre-existed </del> pre-existent material .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#9:1>
<del> Besides, </del> And in Maxwell Davies opera he has used with the
material from medieval to <-> contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> music
for examples : Bach , Mozart .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#10:1>
Besides , the other meaning of parody <del> a </del> is to make fun
or humor by mocking with the <del> pre-existed </del> pre-existent materials
, for examples: Lully's opera , Mozart's &ldquo; magic flute &rdquo; and
Britten &ldquo; A midsummer night's Dream. &rdquo; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#11:1>
And Davies also says that , he uses parody that is to <.> <del>
collecti </del> </.> makes collections with the other composers so he also
<del> <.> calle </.> </del> defined his work is &ldquo; stage props &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#12:1>
Besides , <del> <unc> 3-characters </unc> </del> <-> sinces
</-> <+> since </+> it <del> collected in </del> collected with many
centuries works , so the work also is the collective source from medieval to
<-> contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#13:1>
Now , let us go to see how Davies uses with parody on the &ldquo;
Eight Songs for a mad King. &rdquo; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#14:1>
&ldquo; Eight Songs for a mad king &rdquo; use with vocal ,
percussion , violin , keyboard , cello , flute , piccolo and clarinet .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#15:1>
It is a eight poems by <-> Rondolph </-> <+> Randolph </+> Stow .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#16:1>
The story is about a mechanical <del> piano </del> organ which has
eight tones and it belongs to the King George III to teach the mechanical
bird to sing . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#17:1>
The singer appears in costume and the instrumentalist , violin ,
flute , clarinet and cello also .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#18:1>
And they played in a birdcages which role as the king's birds .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#19:1>
And the <-> percussionlist </-> <+> percussionist </+> role as the
king's keeper . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#20:1>
The first quotation is in Section B of the first song &ldquo;
Sentry &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#21:1>
<?> <del> Where </del> </?> When the harpsichord plays the word
&ldquo; Kingdom &rdquo; , it is quotate from Handel &ldquo; Messiash &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#22:1>
Later , in Section C , the left hand rhythm is <O> musical-notation
</O> is accompaniment of the &ldquo; <-> Messiash </-> <+> Messiah </+>
&ldquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#23:1>
It is very important for Davies to use this because in the <->
contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> period , music mostly is avant garde
or atonal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#24:1>
But he quotates Handel music , then it can <unc> <del>
1-character </del> </unc> attract <del> the </del> the listener . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#25:1>
And in section K to L , there is a dancing melody and the music
is a <del> English </del> England <del> dance </del> folk music of the
medieval period . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#26:1>
In section O of the fourth song &ldquo; To be sung on the water
&rdquo; , the bass melody &ldquo; Flow burned my people &rdquo; play by the
cello is a parody of the melancholy mood of Bartok music and it also full
with Hungarian Folk mood . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#27:1>
Furthermore in the fifth Song &ldquo; <-> Plantom </-> <+> <?>
Phantom </?> </+> Queen &rdquo; there are three bars which <del> labell
</del> abel with &ldquo; Rondino &rdquo; and right hand melody is accented
with accidentals &rdquo; this a parody of the classical keyboard music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#28:1>
Besides , the melody and the harmony are play in different key , and
it is called the out-off-tone .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#29:1>
technique .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#30:1>
And there are many Baroque suite can <.> <del> foun </del> </.> be
found .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#31:1>
The Arietta &rdquo; accompanied by <unc> <del> 1-or-2-characters
</del> </unc> the flute and clarinet is a <.> <?> <del> explan </del>
</?> </.> style of the 18th century aria .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#32:1>
The theme is <del> distorated </del> distorted by the time 15-8 and
<del> quintuptle </del> quintuple .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#33:1>
<del> and </del> And then follows by a &ldquo; Allemende &rdquo; and
&ldquo; Courante. &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#34:1>
This is a parody of the Baroque suite . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#35:1>
Later , in the sixth song &ldquo; The Counterfeit &rdquo; there
is a melody to sing &ldquo; if you tell me a lie &rdquo; and <del> this
</del> the singer is asked to sing in &ldquo; Italian tenor &rdquo; by the
composer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#36:1>
And <.> <del> acut </del> </.> actually this a <.> <del> fa </del>
</.> flamenco style of the spanish singing . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#37:1>
And in the seventh songs &ldquo; The country Dance &rdquo; As the
beginning it <-> labells </-> <+> labels </+> with &ldquo; Scotch Bonnet
&rdquo; it is a Scottish folk dance accompanied by pop music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#38:1>
And secondary dominant <del> is also used </del> and <-> sycropation
</-> <+> <?> syncopation </?> </+> are also heard .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#39:1>
So it <.> <del> ha </del> </.> is the style of Ragtime . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#40:1>
After the rag time , there is a parody of Handel again .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#41:1>
&ldquo; Comfort Ye &rdquo; sings by a female voice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#42:1>
And then it go to a part called the <-> foxtort </-> <+> foxtrot </+>
, which use again the Scotch Dance music , but now with vocal and accompanied
line , but the singer need to sing in speaking voice and it calls <-> foxtort
</-> <+> foxtrot </+> which is popular in American ballroom . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#43:1>
And later in the last part of the 7th song , another <mention>
&ldquo; comfort Ye &rdquo; </mention> appears again , but it is different
from the previous .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#44:1>
<del> It use with the </del> The singers needs to sing in falsetto
screaming <del> with </del> which is a singing technique <?> ie </?> the
tenor sing an octave high <-> them </-> <+> than </+> his <.> <del> oridan
</del> </.> <-> odinary </-> <+> ordinary </+> pitch .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#45:1>
As a result it becomes weaker and this very popular in England . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#46:1>
And in the last song , the king &ldquo; <-> howlling </-> <+>
howling </+> &ldquo; and the <-> percussionlist </-> <+> percussionist </+>
play the <del> brass </del> bass drum with him until the king off-stage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#47:1>
And this is very common use in <.> <del> Shakespear </del> </.>
Shakespearians music . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#48:1>
From the above we can see Davies is interesting on parody and he
also <del> very </del> uses with <-> sucessful </-> <+> successful </+> .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#49:1>
Besides , parody , there is another technique he had used in his
drama .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#50:1>
Firstly is the word painting .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#51:1>
In the first song , there is a &ldquo; snakes &rdquo; shape appear .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#52:1>
The tone draws from high to low and to make a snakes <-> moment </->
<+> <?> movement </?> </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#53:1>
Besides in the &ldquo; The country walking &ldquo; when The singer is
need to sing a melody &ldquo; Child , child whose son are you &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#54:1>
The composer ask to sing &ldquo; Like a child &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#55:1>
<del> And in </del> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#56:1>
And in the &ldquo; The counterfeit &rdquo; there is a melody
&ldquo; Dear , land the sheep , the <?> <del> wort </del> </?> word sheep
<mention> - " ee &rdquo; </mention> is nasal so <del> it is </del> when the
singer sing it , it is very like a sheep . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#57:1>
Besides , Davies also used with dramatic elements .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#58:1>
For example , <del> in </del> when the <del> violinst </del>
violinist finishes his playing the king <del> grap </del> <-> grap </-> <+>
grab </+> the violin and smashed into pieces and as a result he became mad
and <.> <del> hollwi </del> </.> <-> howlling </-> <+> howling </+> off the
stage . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#59:1>
Furthermore , the drama also have historical Character .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#60:1>
<del> In the last six song </del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#61:1>
Firstly , the story is also the <del> 1-character </del> King George
III and in the 6th song &ldquo; the counterfeit &rdquo; <del> it </del> the
king said <quote> &ldquo; I am not nervous &rdquo; and I am not ill" </quote>
are the <.> <del> wo </del> </.> sentence he said before . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#62:1>
And in the drama , Davies also uses with <-> archais </-> <+> <?>
archaic </?> </+> notation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#63:1>
For examples , the Clef for the cello he use <O> clef-symbol </O> and
<del> some </del> in <del> the <unc> 2-characters </unc> </del> the
medieval period , the sharp is put above the note and Davies also use it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#64:1>
However he also uses with <del> the <.> <?> conte </?> </.> </del>
some notation which innovated by <.> <del> hise </del> </.> himself for
example for the chord <O> chord </O> and for breath <O> breath </O> they are
the notation innovated by Davies . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#65:1>
And in the &ldquo; Eight songs <del> of </del> for a mad King.
&rdquo; Davies also uses with <del> may </del> many England music and <del>
ten </del> techniques , for example , Handel &ldquo; Messiah, &rdquo; England
folk dance music the classical style of England and the <-> Sctoch </-> <+>
Scotch </+> <-> Bonnott </-> <+> Bonnet </+> , <del> because </del> since he
is nationalist . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#66:1>
And from the &ldquo; Eight songs for a mad King &rdquo; we can
see that the great achievement which Davies had done is music drama , is that
, <del> he open the mind </del> he <unc> <del> 1-character </del>
</unc> makes the content of music drama <del> <unc> 2-characters
</unc> most </del> more <del> <.> cou </.> </del> colourful .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#67:1>
He <del> give lead </del> opens a new road to collect <del> <unc>
1-character </unc> </del> music material .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#68:1>
In his drama we see it is a component of the medieval , the popular
and the <-> contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#69:1>
<del> He his drama are is full of </del> He use the medieval material
such as the notation , <del> the </del> the Rondino , Arietta , Allemende ,
Courante .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#70:1>
The popular material such as the ragtimes , <-> foxtort </-> <+>
foxtrot </+> , <-> Sctoch </-> <+> Scotch </+> Dance and also with his new
innovation of music . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#71:1>
In conclusion , Maxwell Davies is a great composer in music drama .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#72:1>
since his uses of parody and use the material from medieval to <->
contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> , it makes the drama music in the 20th
<-> contemprary </-> <+> contemporary </+> <?> <.> <del> beca </del> </.>
</?> becomes more interesting and <del> <?> livly </?> </del> lively .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#73:1>
And the other composer also affected by him and go to use parody in
their drama . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#74:1>
10 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#75:1>
<del> Opera is senitive affect </del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#76:1>
British opera , in the twentieth century have a climax of development
under Britain and <del> Tippette </del> Tippett British opera after Purcell
is <del> weak to have </del> in bad <-> situtation </-> <+> situation </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#77:1>
the Italian opera controlled the England Stage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#78:1>
Although some British composer have do something to improve such as
Wagner <del> but it still is <unc> 3-characters </unc> </del> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#79:1>
But it cannot go to the climax .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#80:1>
But when <-> Brittan </-> <+> Britten </+> and <del> Tippette </del> Tippett have a great deal
of work on opera the situation is change <-> immediatley </-> <+> immediately
</+> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#81:1>
Opera is sensitive with the political , economic and social
situation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#82:1>
And it also reflected the <del> people </del> mood of the individual
and community .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#83:1>
<del> The World War II , <unc> 2-words </unc> </del> After
the WWII , world depression arising , as a result , the development of the
opera also be affected .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#84:1>
However , <.> <del> man </del> </.> at the same time , many opera
composer such a <-> Brittan </-> <+> Britten </+> and Tippett realized that it also a <del> change
</del> chance to develop the opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#85:1>
But it must use with the classical techniques and experiment with a
newer music style to open the new page of British opera . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#86:1>
Besides , <del> after the war </del> <-> technogically </-> <+>
technologically </+> , radio , <.> <del> tevelio </del> </.> television and
<del> long and </del> long-term used record is developed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#87:1>
As a result it can help to developed the Opera . </p>
<p> <del> And in the following passages , we go to see the use with the
development ans style of <-> Brittan </-> <+> Britten </+> and Tippett to see </del> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#88:1>
If we want to know the development of the opera I think we must
look through the harmony , text , form , the use of orchestra and aria and
chorus to see how the British opera developed in twentieth century . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#89:1>
As I have say , the composer realized that only with the <.>
<del> rom </del> </.> classical and romantic <.> <del> te </del> </.>
technique and experiment and a newer music mean can develop the opera .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#90:1>
So , <del> the </del> many of the text <del> of the </del> of the
opera are from the old story .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#91:1>
<del> For <.> e </.> </del> Especially from Shakesperian .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#92:1>
For example , in <-> Brittan </-> <+> Britten </+> opera's A Midsummer Night's Dream and
Tippett's Midsummer Marriages &rdquo; are the subject from Shakesperian .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#93:1>
The <-> Midssummer </-> <+> Midsummer </+> Night's Dream .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#94:1>
Besides , Tippett's The knot Garden also from Shakesperian's &ldquo;
All wells that end wells. &rdquo; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#95:1>
Besides <del> text </del> the also deal with the <-> constrast
</-> <+> contrast </+> between the collective activities and the loneliness
and misery of <-> disconteded </-> <+> discontented </+> individual e.g .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#96:1>
Peter Grimes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#97:1>
<del> Besides </del> And also the <-> personnal </-> <+> personal
</+> relationship in the world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#98:1>
So , we can see that the <del> opera </del> British opera now become
more humanity , not only reflects the king or Queen . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#99:1>
And , in the <-> hamony </-> <+> harmony </+> , the development
is the mostly use with tonality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#100:1>
&obrack; ie . with Center key &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#101:1>
Besides also use with the Aeolian Dolian and Phygian mode for the
<-> hamony </-> <+> harmony </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#102:1>
And modulation is also fully used .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#103:1>
However , the techniques of the 20th century such as the atonality ,
Bitonality , <unc> <del> 1-word </del> </unc> are also used .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#104:1>
And in Britten opera's one technique he has <unc> <del>
2-characters </del> </unc> used is interesting ie <-> reconile </-> <+>
reconcile </+> the hostile key by enharmonic mean .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#105:1>
<.> <del> F </del> </.> In the Peter Grimes , the last Prologue ,
Peter and Ellen first meet and sing in the F minor and E major .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#106:1>
However , later , Peter sing in A flat and G sharp and as a result
they sing in the unison . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#107:1>
On the other hand , the using of orchestra is <-> developied
</-> <+> developed </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#108:1>
The orchestra is used not only for colour but also for character ,
<del> and </del> mood <del> For example in Britten's operas he likes to
</del> and for <-> sybomlization </-> <+> <?> symbolization </?> </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#109:1>
For example , Tippett want to perform a <.> <del> maj </del> </.>
magic mood , he uses with , Flute, <?> clesta </?> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#110:1>
In the Curlew River , the <del> <?> halp </?> half </del> flute is
the cause and the expression of the madwoman . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#111:1>
<del> Besides , ensemble is mostly used The <unc>
2-characters </unc> </del> <del> Besides aria the aria <.> i </.> </del>
the form of the 20th centuries British opera is mainly the form of the
classical form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#112:1>
They are the Rondo , ABACA or ABAB with a coda , the binary form AB
and <del> tenery </del> <-> Ternery </-> <+> ternary </+> Form ABC . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#113:1>
Moreover , the aria and chorus is also with the old style .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#114:1>
the opera is <.> <del> devel </del> </.> divided in many Act and the
act also subdivided into many scenes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#115:1>
And there are many numbers of arias for <del> the </del> expression .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#116:1>
And the chorus <unc> <del> 1-word </del> </unc> also used
for commendation on the action . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#117:1>
In conclusion , <.> <del> Britis </del> </.> the British operas
in the 20th centuries have a great development .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#118:1>
And the development is based on the classical techniques and <->
experiement </-> <+> experiment </+> with a newer kind of music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#119:1>
Especially under Britain and <del> Trippett </del> Tippett the two
greatest opera composers in Britain help to <del> make </del> pull the
British opera to a <unc> <del> 1-character </del> </unc> climax .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#120:1>
And develops a new kind of British opera . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#121:1>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#122:1>
During the twentieth centuries , the musical atmosphere have a
great change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#123:1>
Many composers go to use with atonal , serialism <del> and we call
</del> and other new innovation to compose their work . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#124:1>
<del> And in the </del> However , some composers still to
compose the classical work , they go back to the history .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#125:1>
And so <del> it </del> in the following , I choose <-> Lutoslawski
</-> <+> Lutoslavski </+> , the <-> Livre pour </-> <+> <?> Liverpool </?>
</+> <-> orchestra </-> <+> orchestra </+> and <-> Shotackovich's </-> <+>
Shostakovich's </+> 15 symphony to have a comparison . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#126:1>
<-> Lustoslawki </-> <+> Lutoslavski </+> is an avant garde of
the 20th century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#127:1>
<.> <del> Shotac </del> </.> He is a <del> polish </del> poland's
composer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#128:1>
And <-> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+> also is a composer
of 20th century , he also use the atonal and serialism to compose but his
late symphony is much classical , so I chose for comparison .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#129:1>
He is a Russian composer . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#130:1>
<del> Firstly , the metric signature of both </del> Both the
symphonies are in four <del> <.> mome </.> </del> movement .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#131:1>
For <del> <.> Sto </.> </del> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch
</+> , they are &obrack; 1 &cbrack; Allegretto &obrack; 2 &cbrack; Adagio
&obrack; 3 &cbrack; Allegretto &obrack; 4 &cbrack; Adagio .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#132:1>
And to <-> Lutoslawski's </-> <+> Lutoslavski's </+> <del> it also
<.> hav </.> </del> symphony .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#133:1>
it also have 4 movements which he called the 4 chapter .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#134:1>
But between each chapter there is a interlude . <del> And the last
</del> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#135:1>
And the size of the <del> both </del> orchestra of the both
symphonies are in normal size .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#136:1>
But <.> <del> Lut </del> </.> <-> Shotackovich </-> <+>
Shostakovitch </+> emphasis on the percussion part .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#137:1>
He use the percussion to make the climax . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#138:1>
On the other hand , metrical signatures are changed rapidly in
both symphonies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#139:1>
Besides , they both use with new metre such as 7/8 , 5/4 . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#140:1>
<del> And in </del> And the shape of rhythm of both symphonies
have some different .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#141:1>
<-> Lutoslawski </-> <+> Lutoslavski </+> like to use <O>
notation-of-3-4-rhythm </O> such <-> Hrythm </-> <+> rhythm </+> to make a
climax . <marginalia>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#142:1>
And the time for rest also indicate by figure not the rest.
</marginalia>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#143:1>
But to <-> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+> the rhythm is
<.> <?> <del> mor </del> </?> </.> stable . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#144:1>
Besides in <-> Shotackovich's </-> <+> Shostakovitch's </+>
symphony , he like to use with quotation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#145:1>
<del> 2-characters </del> For example , quotation for wagner and
Beethoven . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#146:1>
On the other hand , the harmony they used are different .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#147:1>
Since Lutoslawki is <del> more </del> an avant garde , the harmony
he uses with is also <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> different .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#148:1>
For example , <del> he </del> the harmony line he <del> <unc>
2-characters </unc> </del> uses is not horizontal , on the other hand ,
it is vertical .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#149:1>
Besides he also <.> <del> invo </del> </.> innovented some chord eg .
42424 5353 <&> harmony-lines-written-vertically </&> and also they are group
by their interval .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#150:1>
And he also likes to use with dissonance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#151:1>
And because the characteristic of his <?> <del> <.> wo </.> </del>
</?> work is from tense to relax so he use of dissonance to make the tension .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#152:1>
And <-> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+> also use with
dissonance in his work .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#153:1>
<unc> <del> 1-or-2-characters </del> </unc> And also use
with modality in the symphony . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#154:1>
Furthermore , in <-> Lutoslawski's </-> <+> Lutoslavski's </+>
symphony , compare with <-> Shotachovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+> , there
is many new notation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#155:1>
And many of the notation and invented by <-> Lutoslawski </-> <+>
Lutoslavski </+> eg . <O> notation-symbols </O>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#156:1>
However every notation also has the <-> explaination </-> <+>
explanation </+> by the composer . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#157:1>
And , the other character of <-> Lutoslawski's </-> <+>
Lutoslavski's </+> symphony is that he give the freedom of conduction and
performing between the conductor and performer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#158:1>
His uses <foreign> ad libitum </foreign> for them to <del>
performance </del> perform themselves . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#159:1>
On the other hand , the form of <-> Shotachovich </-> <+>
Shostakovitch </+> 15 symphony is based on sonata form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#160:1>
But to <-> Lutoslawski </-> <+> Lutoslavski </+> it is the <del>
form </del> close form which he developed . </p>
<p> <del>

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#161:1>
In conclusion , both Lutoslawski and Shostakovitch are the greatest
composers of the 20th centuries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#162:1>
And the most different significance of them is that Lutoslawski
under the work of Lutoslawski , there is a communication between the audience
and the con performer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#163:1>
And he also develop the avant </del> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#164:1>
Besides , in <-> Lustoslawski's </-> <+> Lutoslavski's </+>
symphony , he also use with serialism which <-> Shotackovich's </-> <+>
Shostakovitch's </+> in his symphony seldom use .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#165:1>
<-> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+> likes to use with the
tonality . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-014#166:1>
In conclusion , both the composers are the greatest composers of
the 20th centuries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#167:1>
However to a certain extent , they both have different contribution .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#168:1>
For <-> Lustoslawski </-> <+> Lutoslavski </+> , he established the
communication between the <del> performer </del> conductor and the listener .

<ICE-HK:W1A-014#169:1>
And <del> to </del> for <-> Shotackovich </-> <+> Shostakovitch </+>
he <del> still </del> can recall the classical technique of composition in
the 20th centuries . </p>
