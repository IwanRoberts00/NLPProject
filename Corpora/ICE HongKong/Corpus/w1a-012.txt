<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#1:1>
I am going to answer this question from a Marxist perspective , as
I think Marx  ' s theory on class analysis is relevant in evaluating the
present family structure and familial ideology . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#2:1>
Families are basic units of societies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#3:1>
They have changed from stem family , extended or joint family to the
nuclear family of nowadays .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#4:1>
According to the functionalist views , families are expected to carry
out functions or duties such as procreation , emotional gratification ,
socialization of the young , stabilization of adult personality etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#5:1>
In return , societies reward family members with continuity of
companionship , economic rewards etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#6:1>
Moreover , each family members is expected to carry out complementary
roles , such as husbands , fathers , mothers , wives , sons and daughters .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#7:1>
In the past , families used to be centre of production .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#8:1>
All family members were expected to work towards the betterment of the
whole family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#9:1>
However , with the change in the family structure from extended family
to the nuclear family , many of the functions of the families as existed in
the old family structure are taken over by social institutions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#10:1>
For example , education is taken up by schools , colleges ,
employment by factories etc . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#11:1>
With the change in family structure comes the changes in the
roles of family members and even people  ' s attitude towards marriage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#12:1>
People tend to get married at a later age and some even refuse
marriage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#13:1>
When people get married , they hope to find a companion to go hand in
hand with him to cope with all the difficulties in life , rather than at the
requests of their parents . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#14:1>
Although I have talked about the change in family structure ,
some traditional family concepts remain persistent , especially in the sexual
division of labour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#15:1>
Men are expected to carry out the duties of wage earners , while
women to stay at home to take care of the household chores and the rearing of
the young .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#16:1>
In this way , it is considered that the roles of the males are
instrumental while those of the females are expressive ones .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#17:1>
According to the functionalist views , it is when each of the family
member carries out his own role accordingly and satisfactorily then family
solidarity can be achieved .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#18:1>
In other words , if women should go out to work in the labour market
, a breakdown in family solidarity is inevitable .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#19:1>
But I wonder if this is the true reality or that such a family
ideology is a distortion of the true picture , aiming at the rested interests
of a group of people in society , in this context , the males ? </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#20:1>
To understanding the above arguments .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#21:1>
I shall first state some salient points about the family ideology .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#22:1>
Although there is no definition which is generally agreed upon by all
sociologists , a general working definition by Veronica Beechey may help us
to grasp a general idea of the concept: <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#X23:1>
<quote> Family Ideology refers to systems of beliefs of certain
kinship system and a set of living arrangements &obrack; such as the
coresident nuclear family &cbrack; , in which the males are wage earners
while the females are carers at home .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#X24:1>
And this sexual division of labour is basically biologically
determined .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#X25:1>
Therefore the concept is universally accepted and normatively
desirable . </quote> </X> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#26:1>
According to this concept , the females are undoubtedly made
dependent on the males , at least economically .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#27:1>
Some of the feminist writers even think that the females are used as
docile labour reserve , which means that they would be asked to help out in
the labour market when there is a shortage in labour force but when there is
a surplus in labour , they would be required to go back to their home to
carry out their duties as housewives . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#28:1>
I shall go on to examine whether such an ideology is a distorted
view or just false consciousness from a Marxist perspective .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#29:1>
To put it in the Marxist framework of class analysis , the males and
the females are two opposing classes at two extremes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#30:1>
The men are the ruling class while the women the oppressed , just
like the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , or the capitalists and the working
class .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#31:1>
The males belonging to a group with vested interests , advocate such
ideas like: the importance for child rearing by women , the need for women to
take care of their husbands who are badly in need of care and emotional
gratification after a day  ' s hard work , etc , so that the women
unconsciously admit that it is their duties to stay at home to carry out
household duties unpaid , without leave and most of all without due
recognition from society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#32:1>
Moreover , the females are being used as a &ldquo; means to an end
&rdquo; &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#33:1>
they have to satisfy their men  ' s needs in order to prepare them for
work the following days . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#34:1>
As the women have not come to realize their being oppressed ,
they are unable to come to a state which Marx has termed &ldquo; a class for
itself &rdquo; , which means that they cannot group themselves together for
specific purposes to get back what they deserve .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#35:1>
The women have been placed in a passive position in which they cannot
perceive the reality of the world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#36:1>
It is unrealistic that they should be made to believe that what they
are doing is a &ldquo; great job &rdquo; , not to be taken over by the males .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#37:1>
This kind of &ldquo; false consciousness &rdquo; has indeed generated
gender inequality in which women are the victims .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#38:1>
Only a socialist economic revolution may overthrow this according to
Marx . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#39:1>
I shall answer this question with reference to the medicalization
of deviance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#40:1>
I shall examine the growing influence of the medical model by looking
at its intended and unintended effects and finally how social work practice
can work against it . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#41:1>
When one says that a society is &ldquo; over-medicalized, &rdquo;
he is presuming the immense influence of the medical discipline .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#42:1>
I shall take the example of its relevance to deviance to illustrate
my argument .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#43:1>
First of all .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#44:1>
medicalization of deviance refers to the individualization of
deviance , which means that both diagnosis and treatment , terms commonly
used by medical personnel , will be directed to the person who commits the
deviance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#45:1>
Deviance in turn refers to any act which goes beyond the expectation
or to be more specific the norms of a society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#46:1>
For example , <-> alcholism</-> <+> alcoholism </+> , homosexuality ,
drug addiction etc . which are not accepted by our society as a whole . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#47:1>
The medicalization of deviance may be in the form of three:
medical technology , medical collaboration and medical ideology .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#48:1>
Medical technology simply means the application of medicine or
technological treatment , such as brain surgery , psychological sessions etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#49:1>
to treat an individual who is diagnosed to be suffering from deviance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#50:1>
Technical collaboration means the cooperation of the medical
personnel with other disciplines .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#51:1>
For example , when a doctor comes across a suspected child abuse case
, he may need to inform the police or the social Welfare Department , so that
a more concrete welfare plan can be formulated for the child and his family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#52:1>
Medical ideology refers to the belief that medical treatment is for
the benefit or the well being all people . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#53:1>
More passages will be spent on the third aspect - whether
medicalization of deviance is good for the people concerned .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#54:1>
The most significant benefit for a person who committed a deviant act
e.g. drug addiction , may be that when he is assigned a sick role , he is
free from the responsibility of committing deviant act .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#55:1>
Therefore , when he is treated , he may go back to society without
carrying the label of a deviant . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#56:1>
Secondly , the family of the deviant or the sick person may
benefit as well .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#57:1>
They do not feel ashamed or guilty for having a deviant member in the
family . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#58:1>
Thirdly , both the &ldquo; deviant &rdquo; or his family have the
self-fulfilling prophecy that the &ldquo; deviant &rdquo; is only sick and he
will soon be recovered there is a hope among the parties concerned . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#59:1>
Despite the above seemingly advantages , there is still the dark
side of the story .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#60:1>
Firstly , when a deviant is conferred a sick role , he can shun away
his responsibility for committing the deviant act .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#61:1>
In doing so , there is a confusion about who should shoulder the
responsibility for the deviant act .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#62:1>
It would be undesirable or to the extreme , carry the effect of
negative reinforcement for the deviant . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#63:1>
Secondly .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#64:1>
as long as the person is considered as sick , he would be looked upon
by society as a dependent or useless person as most people still consider
sickness as undesirable . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#65:1>
I think our society is to some extent &ldquo; over-medicalized
&rdquo; especially when the medical personnel is assigned such high social
status .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#66:1>
When I say so , I would quote the example of a child abuse case
conference .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#67:1>
In the conference , there would be representatives from the Hospital
Services Department , the Royal Hong Kong Police Force , the Social Welfare
Department .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#68:1>
Each of the representative is expected to give his views about the
case and then decide whether the case is a genuine child abuse case .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#69:1>
However , when the doctors produce such evidence as X'ray films of
bone fractures/dislocation etc. , and when the doctors say that it is a
genuine child abuse case , no counter-arguments are any more effective .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#70:1>
One factor for such phenomenon is like what I just mentioned , the
high social status of doctors and the hard-to-understand terminology of the
medical discipline , which has certainly threatened the people working
outside the medical discipline . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#71:1>
A second example , a hyperkinetic child may be simply given some
tranquilliser to curb down his hyperactivity , so that he may sit down in his
classroom and be less disturbing to his classmates .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#72:1>
Medicine in this aspect may be really helpful because the effect of
the medication has made the hyperkinetic child dull and feel drowsy . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#73:1>
By simply prescribing medication to treat certain deviants may
have the risk of oversimplifying the problem .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#74:1>
Taking the example of the hyperkinetic child again , it is possible
that the child runs about in the classroom or any hyperactive acts may be a
manifestation of his dislike for the school or his reluctance for studies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#75:1>
Therefore , medication cannot treat the core of the problem . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#76:1>
As a social work practitioner , I would like strongly emphasize
the need to look at a deviant and his problem within the social context .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#77:1>
That is I would look at his immediate environment , his significant
others , his upbringing , his family background etc . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#78:1>
As Bandura has often , emphasized the theory of reciprocal
interaction , i.e. the interaction of the person , his behaviour and his
environment , it is unwise to look at the deviant in the vacuum of a social
context .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#79:1>
Therefore , I would say that the medical model should only provide a
perspective for us to look at the problem but it should not be the only
effective means to treat the deviant and his behaviour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#80:1>
Otherwise , the chances are that the deviants would soon relapse into
deviant behaviour again . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#81:1>
I agree with the statement that &ldquo; Hong Kong policy is
rather elitist and authoritative &ldquo; . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#82:1>
Hong Kong is now ruled under two models .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#83:1>
First the Bureaucratic Polity Model , and second , the Elite Ruling
Model .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#84:1>
The Bureaucratic Polity Model shows that Hong Kong is ruled by a
centralized bureaucracy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#85:1>
There is no legitimized channels to observe the operation of the
bureaucracy and people in general have no legitimate means to channel their
views to the bureaucracy . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#86:1>
Under the Elite Ruling Model , Hong Kong is ruled by a group of
rich businessmen who have strong relation with the government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#87:1>
They are admitted to the government under two legislatures , the Exco
and Legco .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#88:1>
A look at the background of these people may help you to understand
why I agree with the statement that Hong Kong is rather elitist and
authoritative .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#89:1>
Most of the Exco and Legco members come from the upper class they are
mostly directors from large corporation , eg. the Hong Kong Bank , and come
from rich families .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#90:1>
Since they have similar background , eg. they live in similar
residential areas , they go to the same recreational clubs , and they appear
in the same charitable organizations , they naturally share the same
interests .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#91:1>
They realize that , as Marx puts it , they are &ldquo; a class for
itself &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#92:1>
Therefore , they are inclined to work towards their own benefit ,
which to certain extent , is the benefit of Hong Kong as most of their
business has economic significance on Hong Kong . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#93:1>
To understand whether Hong Kong can become more pluralistic and
democratic , I shall examine it under 3 categories , the economic development
, political culture and political organization . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#94:1>
Economic development - Hong Kong government has often adopted the
laissez faire economic policy and <-> non-intervenist </-> <+>
non-interventionist </+> approach to the Chinese culture .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#95:1>
As Hong Kong has rised rapidly in economic expansion in the recent
decade , most of the people of Hong Kong have rised above the subsistence
level which means that there are more complicated demands from the people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#96:1>
The government need to change to meet these demands which can no
longer be satisfied by private means .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#97:1>
These demands include better living environment , better education
system etc . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#98:1>
Political culture- the people have always been ambivalent towards
the government , in fact towards politics as a whole , they have low
participation in elections and not much say in political issues etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#99:1>
They leave everything to the government as long as what it is doing
is not detrimental to them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#100:1>
Whereas , the government has often adopted a <-> patriarchial </->
<+> patriarchal </+> approach to deal with the affairs of Hong Kong and they
believe that they are working for the &ldquo; common good &ldquo; of the
people of Hong Kong. </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#101:1>
Political organization &dash; after the signing of the
Sino-British agreement on 26.9.1984 , there seem to be a rise in the number
of political organizations working towards a democratic government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#102:1>
However , these organizations have not been able to persuade the
masses to develop more interests in political issues .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#103:1>
The people of HK still maintain low participation &ampersand; low
interest in politics . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#104:1>
Whether Hong Kong can be more pluralistic and democratic and
whether it can carry on as it is beyond 1997 &semi; from the above three
points , it can be anticipated that HK seems to be lacking adequate
preconditions for a more pluralistic &ampersand; democratic government ,
especially when many educated people or well-off people who are supposed to
be more interested in political affairs have emigrated to other countries .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#105:1>
I doubt very much whether the lower strata who have to earn a
hand-to-mouth living would be more participatory in Hong Kong affairs . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-012#106:1>
China factor is indeed another important factor to influence the
attitude of the people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-012#107:1>
When there is so much uncertainty about Chinese rule , it is
difficult to predict how HK would be like after 1997 . </p> </I>
