<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X112:1:Z>
<[> I  ' ll I  ' ll </[> </{> tell you what I imagine <,> that we
would want </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#113:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X114:1:Z>
It  ' s like a collage

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X115:1:Z>
You know what a collage is </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#116:1:A>
Uh <,> forgot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X117:1:Z>
<&> laughs </&> It  ' s like a <,> I don't know kind of a
collection of pictures stuck <,> on one page </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#118:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X119:1:Z>
Like probably the normal paper size like A four size </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#120:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X121:1:Z>
And on it I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X122:1:Z>
I want to like make some pictures of us and you know some AFS
logo and maybe <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X123:1:Z>
I don't I  ' m not really sure

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X124:1:Z>
<{> <[> What else </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X125:1:Z>
Like maybe something like <,> MTR ticket or something to remember
Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#126:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#127:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X128:1:Z>
And like some Hong Kong letters or something </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#129:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X130:1:Z>
And uh <,,> so in that way we would uh it would be like a front
design and that would come on the front of the shirt </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#131:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X132:1:Z>
Do you think that  ' s possible </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#133:1:A>
Uh yes I think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#134:1:A>
Uh but uh <,> it would be another kind of uh <,,> printing I would
say <,> uh because the

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X135:1:Z>
Yeah it would

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X136:1:Z>
It would probably be more expensive </X> <&> a pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#137:1:A>
Uh <,> I  ' m not sure but uh <,> they they are going to I
think they are going to make it into <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#138:1:A>
Because the the one that like the one that that AFS now has

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X139:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#140:1:A>
Uh is <,,> uh when they when they make the <,> the picture

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X141:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#142:1:A>
Uh they have a frame and then they just <,> uh they have a
frame that <,> that had you know cut out <,> and then

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#143:1:A>
Then they just put the <,,> uh color <{> <[> one color by one
color and then </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X144:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X145:1:Z>
Yeah yeah </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#146:1:A>
On top of the white t-shirt then <,> but then for for for the
one that you are talking about I think they are going to <,> to make <,,> uh
<,> another kind of

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X147:1:Z>
Yeah I  ' m sure so because uh okay I  ' ll tell you why I think it  ' s
possible

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X148:1:Z>
First of all I know it  ' s possible <{1> <[1> cos one girl </[1>
did that in Czech Republic <{2> <[2> as </[2> a present for a friend <{3>
<[3> <unc> three words </unc> </[3> kind of thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X149:1:Z>
And uh <,> secondly you can always see know how they print
photographs on t-shirts <{4> <[4> and stuff </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#150:1:A>
<[1> Yeah it it is possible </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#151:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#152:1:A>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#153:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4> uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X154:1:Z>
So I I  ' m sure it  ' s like possible

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X155:1:Z>
I I  ' m just not sure <{> <[> where </[> how and how much you know
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#156:1:A>
<[> The price </]> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#157:1:A>
The the price shouldn't be <,> like <,,> sky high I think because

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X158:1:Z>
Well I guess we  ' re like willing to pay up to like seventy
dollars or something </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#159:1:A>
No no no no I don't think I don't think it would be <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#160:1:A>
Well the because because uh <,> how uh <,,> the one the the <,,>
no <,> the <,> the production or <{> <[> the </[> the actual <.> co </.> cost
for the <,> for the one that AFS is selling

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X161:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X162:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#163:1:A>
Uh is <,> I think less than thirty

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X164:1:Z>
Yeah how much were they selling it for </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#165:1:A>
I don't know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X166:1:Z>
Because I bought mine <,> but that was in September and there was
a different one

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X167:1:Z>
There was the old one </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#168:1:A>
Oh the old one they <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#169:1:A>
The old one wasn't <,> the the the old one had a <,> another <,>
very complicated story

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X170:1:Z>
Oh right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#171:1:A>
It wasn't <,> it wasn't really AFS thing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X172:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uh huh </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#173:1:A>
<[> It was </[> </{> <,> uh the the t-shirt of something
called AFS <.> fun </.> fun club

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X174:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#175:1:A>
I don't know if if you you have heard of that

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#176:1:A>
But that that thing <,> just some AFS returnees trying to <,> to
get something <{> <[> <,> </[> a accomplished but didn't quite work out at
the end

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X177:1:Z>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X178:1:Z>
I paid like seventy dollars </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#179:1:A>
Yes that one that one I think it cost seventy dollars because
they were they were trying to <{> <[> to make </[> a profit out of that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X180:1:Z>
<[> Jesus </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X181:1:Z>
Ah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#182:1:A>
And then because that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X183:1:Z>
Profit organization </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#184:1:A>
Yes before because that so-called fun club did uh is not
working anymore

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#185:1:A>
<unc> 2 words </unc> not work anymore but they have an
account <,> uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X186:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#187:1:A>
That the AFS doesn't know how to <,> uh the office actually
doesn't know how to how to get <,> how to get the <,> like <,> they they

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#188:1:A>
Actually I don't think they are doing anything with the money they
just keeping it for the <,> fun club

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X189:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#190:1:A>
Still

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X191:1:Z>
Well it doesn't <,> matter </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#192:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X193:1:Z>
They will use it somehow

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X194:1:Z>
But that  ' s funny

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X195:1:Z>
Yep anyways

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X196:1:Z>
That  ' s <{> <[> uh </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#197:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> <,,> yeah uh uh let me <.> s </.> see

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#198:1:A>
Uh <,,> the I think you <,> uh <,,> do you think you guys can uh
<,,> could have a <,,> like a draft of the <,> of the whole <,> picture

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X199:1:Z>
Oh Like a draft </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#200:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X201:1:Z>
Oh well <,> I guess it will be just easier if I just do the thing
straight away

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X202:1:Z>
You know what I mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#203:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#204:1:A>
You you can do that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X205:1:Z>
Well yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#206:1:A>
Okay

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X207:1:Z>
But I would need some time maybe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#208:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X209:1:Z>
To collect like some of the things like a little map of Hong Kong
and you know things like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#210:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X211:1:Z>
So I could do it definitely

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X212:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#213:1:A>
Uh <,> oh yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#214:1:A>
Maybe maybe it would it would I just remember maybe because you
are probably not going to make <,> a whole <,> lot of t-shirts

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#215:1:A>
So <,> it may <{> <[> it might be </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X216:1:Z>
<[> It might be </[> </{> more expensive <{> <[> <,> </[> for
each one </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#217:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X218:1:Z>
I know I know

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X219:1:Z>
We  ' ll probably make like thirty or something but we  ' ll see

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X220:1:Z>
I I have to write to the <,> to all the kids and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#221:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X222:1:Z>
And we should also maybe like get a design competition or
something

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X223:1:Z>
Too much too much trouble </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#224:1:A>
Do you think do you think it uh or is there is there any of
you are good at that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X225:1:Z>
In design </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#226:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X227:1:Z>
No I can do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X228:1:Z>
I I I  ' m quite good in design <,> and I I don't really want like
a big design. It  ' s like a <,> collage which is <{> <[> easy </[> to make and
I have a good idea of how to make it <,,> So I wouldn't be that worry about
it but uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#229:1:A>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#230:1:A>
That  ' s good

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X231:1:Z>
But I just hope they will like it in the end <&> laughed </&>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#232:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X233:1:Z>
But you know I I  ' m thinking you know that maybe everyone will
have like will want to <,> get one maybe for their first friends or want to
get some for the office and you know support contacts and things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X234:1:Z>
So <,> we might all like <,> we we may get it up to maybe <,>
fifty sixty </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#235:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X236:1:Z>
So <,> that already could be a little cheaper

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X237:1:Z>
<{> <[> Unless </[> AFS wants to sell them and make for profit so
they could like get two hundred copies or something </X> <&> both-laugh </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#238:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X239:1:Z>
Uh <,> well <,,> I don't know maybe because <,,> maybe they do
maybe they will and I you know I  ' m not sure

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X240:1:Z>
Don't worry

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X241:1:Z>
We will just get like sixty or something like that and <{> <[>
that  ' s </[> okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#242:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#243:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X244:1:Z>
Uh I  ' ll have to maybe start </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#245:1:A>


<ICE-HK:S1A-091#246:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X247:1:Z>
So I  ' ll start like <,> doing the design and I  ' ll start writing
to people about it <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X248:1:Z>
How about that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#249:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#250:1:A>

<{2> <[2> Then </[2> we  ' ll find the cost and everything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#255:1:A>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X291:1:Z>
You can educate me

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X292:1:Z>
Why is it a yearbook and not an yearbook

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X293:1:Z>
<mention> Yearbook </mention> starts with a Y </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#294:1:A>
Because <{> <[> <,> A E A E I O U </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X295:1:Z>
<[> Oh it  ' s a year

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X296:1:Z>
Is it a </[> </{> special exception </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#297:1:A>
Hmm no no actually uh I think I think most of the cases <,>
just uh words start with the letters A E I O U the vowel

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X298:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#299:1:A>
Or <,> or in some cases would <,> if you say MTR you MTR
station you would say an MTR station <,> because

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X300:1:Z>
Wow that  ' s true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#301:1:A>
M is like if you if you want to <.> s </.> to spell it it
would be am or em

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X302:1:Z>
Yeah <{> <[> yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#303:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X304:1:Z>

Very strange </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#311:1:A>
I I think it  ' s it  ' s like because may maybe because Y is a
<,,> I think I think it  ' s called a semi-vowel or something

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#X312:1:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#313:1:A>

but it  ' s just like too hard to organize the people and on the <,> you know
like get the ferry ticket and everything you need to get that <{> <[> <,>
</[> in advance I think </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-091#759:1:A>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-091#760:1:A>
