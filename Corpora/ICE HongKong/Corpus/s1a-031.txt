Once once you get there the the <.> gen </.> generally the <,>
everybody seems to know that you need to go there in a crowd

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X73:1:Z>
If you just go with two or three people it  ' s it  ' s not right

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X74:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#241:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#245:1:A>
Yes I guess we come to

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#246:1:A>
I don't know whether it  ' s just uh uh attempt for you periodically

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#247:1:A>
They comes to uh at a stage is it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#248:1:A>
Oh there are so many nice things how can you get all

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#249:1:A>
You can't possess all of them so why bother I said is it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X250:1:Z>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X251:1:A>
I think it  ' s <,> but uh this is a very <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X252:1:A>
I don't know this is <,> this state of mind

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X253:1:A>
This state of mind <,> uh <,> happens now and then and I  ' m
always in this state of mind

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X254:1:Z>
Well I used to think for instance you see <,> uhm I spend most of
<,> my <,> twenty years in England when I when I got a job <,> uhm collecting
books <{1> <[1> that </[1> was my passion <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X255:1:Z>
Because I didn't bring the books out here <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> I  ' ve
left them in the UK

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X256:1:Z>
<{3> <[3> I </[3> I used to think I couldn't live without them

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X257:1:Z>
I just live <{4> <[4> without them for years </[4> and uhm <,> so
why do I need them <,> really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#258:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#259:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#260:1:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#261:1:A>
<[4> Yes that  ' s right uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#262:1:A>
Exactly this <unc> two words </unc> you <?> got to </?> a
stage

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#263:1:A>
At one stage you thought ah I must have that

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#264:1:A>
I must buy that

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#265:1:A>
I can't really it  ' s so <unc> multiple words </unc>
because I I I I I haven't <,> I have to <unc> one word </unc> of all

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#266:1:A>
This is it <&> long-pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X267:1:Z>
I don't know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#268:1:A>
This uh this this is one of hard experience when we left
because uh <,> uh twenty <,> twenty three years ago nineteen nine seventy-two
we left <,> Hong Kong for Australia so uh it  ' s it is sadly that state at
that time so many things to pack so many books so that we left <,> there
eight <,> eight cartons of books and other <,> other belongings

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X269:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#270:1:A>
And then we don't we put them in the <.> go </.> in a store
house

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#271:1:A>
And because this the rate is very cheap few hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#272:1:A>
At that time was a hundred dollar but you uh it it <,> it gone up
but uh on that <unc> one- word </unc> for ten years

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X273:1:Z>
Wow </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#274:1:A>
But it  ' s still only five hundred so <,> uh per week

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X275:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#276:1:A>
Per per month sorry

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X277:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#278:1:A>
Five hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#279:1:A>
<unc> three words </unc> eighty one <,> but this is no the
<.> o </.> <,> and the other problem when you <,> when <,> and we also took
back a lot of stuff from Australia

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#280:1:A>
You you know I think you know the <,> the feeling

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#281:1:A>
Uh you <,> can't move from a <,> big house with a lot of stuff to
a smaller house

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#282:1:A>
You you want to throw out everything <,> so that at that time you
thought wow those uh because uh <,> there were those were eight cartons eight
boxes in the in the store room house you see

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#283:1:A>
I  ' m thinking first of all I  ' ll <,> I  ' ll get all the books and
uh uhm most of the books uh we actually had been <,> had been <,> those we
thought useful have been <,> replaced over the years

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#284:1:A>
And uhm of course and also it was when we first come back I don't
know we had <,> we had so many things so many we we have enough headaches <,>
so we  ' re <?> thinking </?> of thinking of should we <,> we don't want to
keep on <,> paying the the uh uh the storage <,> uh uh fees all the time

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#285:1:A>
So then either we <,> take them out to retrieve them <,> and
<unc> two words </unc> we thought uh they are a not a big deal

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#286:1:A>
They are really not uh they are duplicates and also you <,> when
you see the eight boxes but you don't know <,> where to put them <?> you see
</?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#287:1:A>
So uh <,> do I have a <unc> one-word </unc> very painful
decision

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#288:1:A>
I said okay <,> tell the store house we  ' re not going have have
these <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#289:1:A>
Do whatever dispose <,> them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X290:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#291:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#292:1:A>
Uhm <,> and uh another years we start uh I myself start to regret
<,> wish wish I should not <,> done because not the books

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#293:1:A>
The books are actually more or less duplicates

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X294:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#295:1:A>
You see

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#296:1:A>
In one of the box I put <unc> two-words </unc> is many
things

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X297:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#298:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#299:1:A>
Those uh <,> those albums and those this this is all this all this
<unc> one word </unc> things

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#300:1:A>
And I start as <,> I start to miss them

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#301:1:A>
Especially <,> uh some of them somethings uh <,> I I collect for
example uh uh stamp albums which I <{1> <[1> collected </[1> since my
secondary school

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#302:1:A>
I still <{2> <[2> remember </[2> what <,> what what was in there

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#303:1:A>
I I <{3> <[3> had </[3> a whole set <,> of the Malaysia when they
became <unc> one-word </unc> <{4> <[4> when </[4> they became
independent

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#304:1:A>
Whole set of <,> stamps <{5> <[5> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#305:1:A>
And </[5> also uh uh uh one or two very

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#306:1:A>
At that time when I was a <,> a schoolgirl I was already very
valuable

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#307:1:A>
<{6> <[6> I was </[6> <,> this that

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#308:1:A>
I was in that <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#309:1:A>
But at that time I I I just just don't want to because if I want
to dig this up I have to take <,> to the whole thing and I I don't know which
<,> which box was in here

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X310:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X311:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X312:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X313:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X314:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X315:1:Z>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X316:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#317:1:A>
And this would be

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#318:1:A>
At that time it was a <?> greatly </?> I I got a headache
sometimes so I said out <unc> three words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#319:1:A>
If I <,> I can <,> be away with it <,> ten years I don't need any
more

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#320:1:A>
But now I start to miss this kind of this this a few <{> <[> of
</[> those albums

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#321:1:A>
A few of them now are those are those <unc> one-word
</unc> which I <,> which I collect over over when I was since <?> you
</?> young girl

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#322:1:A>
These are all my memories during the <,> even after all these
years

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#323:1:A>
A teenagers you see and I still <,> I still <,> uh <,> start <,>
to miss these things you see

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#324:1:A>
So that I decide actually <,> we when whenever if there  ' s any
move and that should not be affected by the <,> that state of mind at that
time

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X325:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X326:1:Z>

<unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#328:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#329:1:A>
No matter <,> how bothersome or troublesome at <,> that time we
should still <,> uh try to collect them actually

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#330:1:A>
<{> <[> Yeah <,> yeah </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X331:1:Z>
<[> Yeah <,> I think you  ' ll </[> </{> you  ' ll get more
discerning about what to throw away and what not

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X332:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Uh <,> </[1> you know while you were talking I <.> w
</.> I was thinking of one or two instances <{2> <[2> of </[2> the things I  ' ve
I  ' ve thrown away or sold that I <{3> <[3> deeply </[3> regret now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#333:1:A>
<[1> That  ' s right

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#334:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#335:1:A>

Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X339:1:Z>
Uh but uh there there are less and less of them as I grow older

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X340:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Yeah </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X341:1:Z>
And uh <,> I have thrown a lot of stuff away <{2> <[2> over the
years still <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X342:1:Z>
But uh it is very difficult </X>

<$A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#354:1:A>
I was <,> I was I was a bit I was a very pleased about Chinese
opera <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#355:1:A>
And also I collect a lot of these and <unc> one-word
</unc> of write uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#356:1:A>
I try to write

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#357:1:A>
I thought it was like something like of uh <,> uh uhm uh uh uh <.>
s th </.> some something uh uh more creative work of this and this and also
<unc> two words </unc> all these things that will go on <unc>
one-word </unc> <{2> <[2> <&> laughs </&> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#358:1:A>
Because at that time I really want <,> I don't I want to to

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#359:1:A>
Actually I was deliberate as I put this in the <,> because uh I
want to <unc> one-word </unc> why why didn't I never uh why didn't I
know about this

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#360:1:A>
Because at that time <,> <unc> two-words </unc> this is a
<&> tut </&> this is a very strange way of think I just want to depart from
this so that I really I try to bury this inside the box

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#361:1:A>
Otherwise <,> because <unc> five words </unc> just just a
<,> just an album I didn't I brought it to Australia <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#362:1:A>
<{3> <[3> But </[3> this is not <,> uh physically not a burden but
it  ' s sort of <,> I deliberately want to <,> part <,> part part away from the
memories you see <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#363:1:A>
It <?> is a worries </?> that I put it in a box but now I say I
should have <,> taken it out <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#364:1:A>
Yeah because at at at a certain stage <,> I my I myself this is so
<,> so so so silly so so so what

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#365:1:A>
So childish you see <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> to do this <{6> <[6> kind
of </[6> things <&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#366:1:A>
But uh but uh but now I <.> s </.> remember to <unc> two words
</unc> so that when I say that wow I don't know where <,> what did the
store man what did the people from the storehouse did with those uh those
things

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#367:1:A>
Will they sold it people that people at the Hollywood Road the
customers

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#368:1:A>
I say if so say <?> one day </?> if one day I just when I was uh
<,> uh uh walking along <unc> one- word </unc> I saw one of one of
the <,> albums I would buy it back <{7> <[7> <,> regardless of </[7> the of
of of its price <&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X369:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X377:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> In </[1> fact when <,> when I was a student uh my <,>
uh we weren't married but my <,> my wife <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> bought me a
tankard you know uh a <unc> one-word </unc> tankard <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X378:1:Z>
And uh <,> she engraved on it  ' s a <,> a line from Bertrand
Russell <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X379:1:Z>
Uh uh <,> it was uh a line of poetry but he he wasn't a poet
really but he he wrote this line of poetry when he <,> when he first fell in
love <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X380:1:Z>
And uhm <,> this tankard got stolen at a student party <{6> <[6>
<,> </[6> and I  ' m still looking for it <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X381:1:Z>
Every time I go back to Britain and go into a junk shop <{8> <[8>
<,> </[8> I think uh uh the the the tankard shape is distinctive <{9> <[9>
<,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X382:1:Z>
And of course with this line of poetry engraved on the bottom it  ' s
it  ' s unique so I <{10> <[10> hope </[10> I  ' m sure I will find it <{11>

been discussing

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X523:1:Z>
It  ' s it  ' s not his fault it  ' s mine because I I  ' ve had <,> I  ' ve
<,> been meaning to introduce it to to our library management <{2> <[2> till
</[2> before </X>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X527:1:Z>
For five weeks now <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> it  ' s been so busy and I
just <,> uh put it in the base but I  ' ll I  ' ll <,> bring it forward to
tomorrow be because uh I didn't realize it would have repercussions on all
the sections like uh <,> like Maurice  ' s as well <{2> <[2> so let  ' s </[2> do
something </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#528:1:A>

<[2> Uhm yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#530:1:A>
Yeah because she was worrying whether these over a thousand books
on the <,> shelves <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> whether <,> uh uh uh at another time
will these books will be <{2> <[2> removed to <,> </[2> to the closer stacks

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X531:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X534:1:Z>

Sorry

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X536:1:Z>
After you </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-031#537:1:A>
<[> Cause I <,> told

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#538:1:A>
Yeah her </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#539:1:A>
I told her actually my consideration is not solely space

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#540:1:A>
My concern is that these books have been put on the semi-close
stacks so that as many <,> people could use it as possible <{> <[> <,> </[>
but with a certain measure of control

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X541:1:Z>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X542:1:Z>

Yeah that  ' s fine

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X544:1:Z>
Well that that that  ' s <,> that  ' s what I I thought that actually
<.> t </.> this would progress <,> uh even if the Hong Kong China Collection
<{1> <[1> uh did progress </[1> and we set off that these books remain in
<{2> <[2> <,> semi-close

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X545:1:Z>
They </[2> wouldn't back to <{3> <[3> <,,> close <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X546:1:Z>
And I think that was some <unc> one-word </unc> about
<unc> one-word </unc> <{4> <[4> in </[4> the in the Hong Kong China
collection but uh I must put it through <?> LMT </?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-031#X547:1:Z>

computer system went down there was a long time before we <,> <{3> <[3> we
