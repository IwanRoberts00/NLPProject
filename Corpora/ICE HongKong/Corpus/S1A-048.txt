<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X1:1:Z>
Did you have your examination this morning </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#2:1:A>
Uh <,> afternoon twelve ten

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X3:1:Z>
What <,> what is it about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#4:1:A>
Uh EAS course

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#5:1:A>
I think <,> because you are visiting student so you don't need to
attend that course

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#6:1:A>
<{> <[> All the </[> first year student have to

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#7:1:A>
This is uhm <,> uh a course for to enhance your English ability <,>
to produce a good essay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#8:1:A>
A good essay means which is academic <,> with uhm <,,> the academic
research

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#9:1:A>
Well researched <,> and the materials is well organised and have
your own comment and argument and with <,> uh the material support your <.>
argu </.> uh <,> uh argument <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#10:1:A>
That is the objective of the course

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X11:1:Z>
<[> That  ' s right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X12:1:Z>
Oh so what are you writing about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#13:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X14:1:Z>
What are you writing about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#15:1:A>
Write <,> uh I have write four four essay this year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X16:1:Z>
Four </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#17:1:A>
Yeah four

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#18:1:A>
Two for each term <,> and <,> I have write on family in Japanese
system

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#19:1:A>
It is uhm <,> the to uh presentation essay <,> and I have write a
<,> a theme report uh based on <,> any theme I I I like and then write a
report but should be academic <,> but I don't think my essay is academic
enough <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#20:1:A>
And in the first term I write uhm <,> the <,> the crime the uh the
causes of crime <,> and it  ' s also a <,> presentation essay and the previous
one is uhm <,> what  ' s that

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#21:1:A>
I forgot <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#22:1:A>
Total four essays <{> <[> and </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X23:1:Z>
<[> So </[> </{> what are you doing this afternoon </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#24:1:A>
It is oral examination because we uh beside the academic essay
produce we should have a academic a uh discussion

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#25:1:A>
Oral discussion <{1> <[1> <,> based </[1> on <,> a materials and
read it drop notes and then discuss with your <,> classmate <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#26:1:A>
Should be academic

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#27:1:A>
So all the thing you you are you talking or you uhm deliver to the
<unc> one-word </unc> uh people should have some material support
based on the articles

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X28:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X29:1:Z>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X30:1:Z>
Is it good </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#31:1:A>
Uh I think the uhm <,,> essay is better because I I <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#32:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> maybe maybe we are in Music
Department because <,> so we don't have a lot of chance to discuss our <,,>
our our our our course <&> recording-level-drops </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#33:1:A>
So <,> I think the <,> uh essay part is useful

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X34:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#35:1:A>
But <unc> one-word </unc> more than the oral part

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X36:1:Z>
Uhm <,> but you think it  ' s useful

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X37:1:Z>
The course is useful </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#38:1:A>
Yes useful

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X39:1:Z>
Ah good

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X40:1:Z>
I might have to do it next year <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X41:1:Z>
Cos I  ' m gonna to be a full-time student I hope <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X42:1:Z>
<{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#43:1:A>
<[> Maybe </[> </{> you you can ask <,> uhm uh student <.> ad
</.> admission office or or the Arts Faculty to <,> uh say you are visiting
student but you are now transferred to a regular student

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X44:1:Z>
I <{> <[> have <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X45:1:Z>
I have </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X46:1:Z>
But <,> but you know it  ' s a lot of <,> bureaucracy so they have
to approve

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X47:1:Z>
<unc> multiple words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X48:1:Z>
Let  ' s see what happens </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#49:1:A>
<[> You did

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#50:1:A>
You did </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#51:1:A>
How is the progress in <,> transfer to uh to be a regular student
<,> doing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X52:1:Z>
I don't know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X53:1:Z>
I have no idea </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#54:1:A>
Should be <,> have a result after the examination

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X55:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X56:1:Z>
<unc> two-words </unc> yeah I think so and and also <,>
they say it depends on on my results in the examination </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#57:1:A>
I think you <{> <[> would not have a big problem </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X58:1:Z>
<[> If they  ' re really bad <,> </[> </{> <&> laughs </&> they  ' re
really bad they won't accept me </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#59:1:A>
Because I remember I received the confirmation for <{> <[> <,>
</[> uh admit the university rather late in uh the beginning of September
last year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X60:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X61:1:Z>
Oh really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#62:1:A>
Yeah and it is September September eighth <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
and I come to take my confirmation letter in person because I I am afraid
they will uh some mistake in the mail <{2> <[2> so </[2> maybe you should <,>
<?> contact </?> them and always telephone the Arts Faculty and ask what  ' s
the result what  ' s going on then <.> tha </.> they will be <,> more efficient
on your progress

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X63:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X64:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X65:1:Z>
Yeah maybe maybe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#66:1:A>
Because if it is too late it it is very difficult to
considerate what <,> our planning is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X67:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X68:1:Z>
So how are you uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X69:1:Z>
Have you done your specimen paper yet <,> for techniques </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#70:1:A>
Specimen what

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X71:1:Z>
Specimen paper </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#72:1:A>
<{> <[> Uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X73:1:Z>
<[> Do </[> </{> you remember the assignment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#74:1:A>
Uh you mean Chan Kam Biu

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X75:1:Z>
Pardon

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X76:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X77:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X78:1:Z>
Yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#79:1:A>
<[> Chan Kam Biu one </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#80:1:A>
I have worked out all uh the chord <,> already

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#81:1:A>
And the <,> outline of the uh <,> fifteen and twenty bars chord
progression

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#82:1:A>
<{1> <[1> I </[1> haven't insert all the details notes on the score
<{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#83:1:A>
So </[2> I think I will finish uh tonight <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#84:1:A>
Able to

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X85:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X86:1:Z>
<[2> Oh I see </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X87:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#88:1:A>
How about you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X89:1:Z>
It  ' s difficult

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X90:1:Z>
I  ' m I  ' m I have done <,> about half of it but I don't know how it
sounds </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#91:1:A>
You have organised all the chords already

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X92:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#93:1:A>
But uhm <,> you find a <{> <[> little <unc> two-words
</unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X94:1:Z>
<[> The melody </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#95:1:A>
But I I think <,> the <,> uh that way is

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#96:1:A>
The best way is to work out the chord progression first

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X97:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#98:1:A>
Mr Chen Mr Chan tell us <,> <{> <[> and </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X99:1:Z>
<[> I </[> </{> did that first but then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#100:1:A>
The problem is how to use that <&>

$Z laughs </&> <.> s </.> specific chord <,> the <{> <[> the <?> diminishing
</?> chords </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X101:1:Z>
<[> The passing note </[> </{> and everything

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X102:1:Z>
I don't know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#103:1:A>
But I found the original sonata from Beethoven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#104:1:A>
Uhm he used the first six bar again in the coming fifteen to
twenty bar so I also imitate the format of him

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X105:1:Z>
You found the original

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X106:1:Z>
Oh <{> <[> I </[> see oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#107:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> then but I I would not exactly copy the
six first six bar into my uh passage but <{1> <[1> I </[1> would use the
chord progression and <,> change the melody and the uh rhythmic pattern <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> so I I can work lesser than uh the <?> entire </?> everything

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#108:1:A>
So I have the first six bar and I have work a three bar transition
to <,> repeat the uh first six bar and use <,> uh I I think I use three to
five bar to work out the uh modulation to uh C major

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X109:1:Z>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X110:1:Z>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X111:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X112:1:Z>
Oh you are doing the C major </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#113:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X114:1:Z>
Me too

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X115:1:Z>
So </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#116:1:A>
The original passage is G major

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X117:1:Z>
<{> <[> G major </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#118:1:A>
<[> Not C </[> </{> major or G minor

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X119:1:Z>
<{> <[> Oh really </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#120:1:A>
<[> So you </[> </{> cannot copy exactly

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X121:1:Z>
Oh good

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X122:1:Z>
He made sure that you couldn't copy the original <&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X123:1:Z>
So <,> did you go to Kelina  ' s tutorial yesterday </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#124:1:A>
Uh yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#125:1:A>
I have taken my Bartok assignment but I  ' ve got only C minus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X126:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#127:1:A>
Uh I  ' ve heard from Agnes you you  ' ve got a A <,> minus is it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X128:1:Z>
How did she know

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X129:1:Z>
I didn't tell her <&> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#130:1:A>
Maybe she have a look uh somewhere

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#131:1:A>
Ah it  ' s A minus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X132:1:Z>
Yeah I was lucky </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#133:1:A>
I I don't know what  ' s the difference between <,> A minus and
C minus because I <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#134:1:A>
If I have a chance to look at your uh essay then I would see what
<,> what  ' s the what what  ' s the uh materials I  ' ve missed in my essay so I
got C minus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X135:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X136:1:Z>
You can you can look at it if you want to

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X137:1:Z>
I think what she like maybe was that I

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X138:1:Z>
Maybe my presentation uhm I made a table so that you can compare
<,> the two uhm parts like violin <,> one and violin two <,> and then <,>
maybe that I had a very distinct idea about maybe that was it

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X139:1:Z>
Cos she said that was the most important thing that you should
have a uhm special view or something </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#140:1:A>
I think my problem for not uh to get <?> a higher grade </?>
is she said I  ' ve <,> raised up all the <,> important thing but without
further elaboration about the thing <,> I  ' ve raised

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X141:1:Z>
Uh yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#142:1:A>
Let  ' s let  ' s let say uh I found that the first violin and
the second violin is playing <,> a <,> fifth part <{> <[> <,> </[> uh when
when they entry in the second section but I haven't tell <,> more detail
about this fifth part is

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#143:1:A>
What kind of fifth is diminish fifth or augmented fifth because
there  ' s a lot of fifth a lot of type of fifth

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X144:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X145:1:Z>
Oh I see

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X146:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#147:1:A>
<[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </{> something like
that so I I I I got a lower grade

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X148:1:Z>
I think you shouldn't be afraid of uhm <,> uhm <,,> leaving out
things

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X149:1:Z>
I mean if we have a special idea <,> that this is the way I think
the piece works

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X150:1:Z>
If we have that idea even if it  ' s narrow and doesn't <,> you
know doesn't concern all the details of the piece

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X151:1:Z>
If we really uhm are convincing you know you can get away with it
<{> <[> <,> </[> just a single idea </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#152:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#153:1:A>
And then also other Kelina what will we do in the examination

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#154:1:A>
Did did you ask her

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X155:1:Z>
Yeah we do </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#156:1:A>
She said just like <,> doing an assignment <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#157:1:A>
Just like doing an assignment

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X158:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X159:1:Z>
She said we don't have to revise very much </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#160:1:A>
Just you you you you uh can able to pass the exam just you
haven't drunk

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X161:1:Z>
Yes she  ' s joking </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#162:1:A>
And she said uh it it will not be very difficult to you <,>
then I say not difficult to you but not us <&> both laugh </&> because we are
year one student

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#163:1:A>
And I said I would me Agnes and Raymond have no more time to
repeat so we should have <&>

$Z laughs </&> <,> one hundred percent control

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#164:1:A>
Our result should be passed <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#165:1:A>
So we want to know <,> a lot uhm more more thing about the
examination

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#166:1:A>
What will we do <,> especially the history

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X167:1:Z>
<[> Nice try </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X168:1:Z>
So which examination are you most worried about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#169:1:A>
Uh history

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X170:1:Z>
History </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#171:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#172:1:A>
I I I I  ' m not very worried about the the analysis and techniques
and the <.> compu </.> uh computer uh music application

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#173:1:A>
Uhm maybe music history sociology and computer programming in
computer science department <,> so <{> <[> these </[> three course I I should
have paid <,> more time to <.> re re </.> uh do the revision

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X174:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X175:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#176:1:A>
And history is the most difficult one <,> I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X177:1:Z>
Maybe

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X178:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X179:1:Z>
I am worried about history <,> and technique and maybe <,>
computer as well because <,> <{> <[> I I have </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#180:1:A>
<[> You mean </[> </{> music improvisation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X181:1:Z>
Yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X182:1:Z>
I have to study </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#183:1:A>
What what will you do in the score uh note processing

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#184:1:A>
Will you uh finale or score or encode

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X185:1:Z>
If I can choose <,> in <unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#186:1:A>
He said we can choose one of three

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X187:1:Z>
I think score </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#188:1:A>
Score

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#189:1:A>
You you familiar with score

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#190:1:A>
I  ' m familiar with finale

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X191:1:Z>
Maybe I don't know I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X192:1:Z>
Let  ' s see <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X193:1:Z>
I have to study them during these weeks now

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X194:1:Z>
I have time to revise look at the manuals <{> <[> <unc> two-
words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#195:1:A>
<[> But <,> </[> </{> but for the purpose to pass the
examination just use the most familiar one

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#196:1:A>
But if you want to have a more convenient software to work out the
processing I think Finale is the best one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X197:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#198:1:A>
In the in the moment I know every software I think Finale is
very good one <{> <[> <,> </[> because <,> you remember if you type uhm <,>
let  ' s say five bar in first system <,> and you found is very tense for the
space you want to put the a fifth bar to the second system you should delete
all the <,> bar in <,> uh bar five and then type it in the second system
again

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#199:1:A>
You see you cannot just press uh down arrow then the fifth bar
will <,> go to the second system

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#200:1:A>
Finale do that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X201:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X202:1:Z>
Oh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#203:1:A>
Let  ' s say

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#204:1:A>
<.> B </.> because you type the score is a <,> horizontal line
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#205:1:A>
It doesn't matter uh which how many system uh how many bar in the
system

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#206:1:A>
Uh after you press uhm let  ' s say <,> twelve bar <,> then you tell
uh the system you want four measure in the system then <&> phone rings </&>
automatically automatically the uh system will help you to <,> put four
measure in the system four measure in the system then you want the three
system

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#207:1:A>
And if just uh say the introduction only <,> uh have uh three
measure and the four the fourth bar is <,> below the beginning of the first
verse so you press down arrow then all the fourth bar would go to the second
system <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#208:1:A>
It  ' s very convenient

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X209:1:Z>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X210:1:Z>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X211:1:Z>
Uhm uhm sorry </X> <&> a long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#212:1:A>
How long should we talked

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X213:1:Z>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#214:1:A>
Yeah Mr Chan  ' s uh tutorial

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#216:1:A>
I I have to <,,> get a remind what time is it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X217:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X218:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X219:1:Z>
<unc> four words </unc> when you had tutorial with Kelina
<,> did she speak English or Cantonese to you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#220:1:A>
English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X221:1:Z>
English </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#222:1:A>
All all our group is uh Chinese Betty Raymond and me but she
also say uh English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X223:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#224:1:A>
I think <,> in the university all all the lecturer and <,> uh
uh tutor is exception

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#225:1:A>
Uh lecturer will is also saying is always saying English to the
student

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X226:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#227:1:A>
But I think it is uhm uh culture or <{> <[> communication
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X228:1:Z>
<[> Regulation </[> </{> <,> <?> sort of </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#229:1:A>
I am not sure it  ' s a regulation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X230:1:Z>
Uhm yeah I think so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#231:1:A>
Even the last lecture in Chan Kam Biu you are absent and uh
in your

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#232:1:A>
It  ' s uh it  ' s well <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[> he
also say in English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X233:1:Z>
<[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X234:1:Z>
Oh he speaks English </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#235:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X236:1:Z>
Oh right

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X237:1:Z>
Oh really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#238:1:A>
Not not for because you you are are foreigner you you don't
know Cantonese so <.> s </.> they speak English

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#239:1:A>
I think in the other department and especially in the EAS course
after the lecture or the class the tutor or the teacher is also is always
saying English to us

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X240:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#241:1:A>
No Cantonese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X242:1:Z>
But this it  ' s better for you to know more English because uhm it  ' s
better to to have an international education <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X243:1:Z>
I think so for myself as well because if I was to study in
Swedish I would study </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#244:1:A>
But I have a classmate she went to <.> Jap </.> uh Japan for
the uh five-year degree course

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#245:1:A>
<unc> two words </unc> She originally is the foreign
student in this university

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#246:1:A>
She got the full scholarship from the Japanese government so

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X247:1:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#248:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#249:1:A>
And she said she will do Japanese communication and Japanese essay
in the Japanese university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X250:1:Z>
In <.> Jap </.> in Japanese </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#251:1:A>
Yes no English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X252:1:Z>
But <,> but that  ' s Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X253:1:Z>
I mean Hong Kong is such a small place and I mean internationally
it  ' s very important to know English so I think I think it  ' s important <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X254:1:Z>
I remember in the beginning Mr Chan said <,> oh I have to speak
English oh you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X255:1:Z>
He didn't like it very much but <,> but maybe now he <,> has <{>
<[> got used to </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#256:1:A>
<[> But Hong Kong </[> </{> is not a <.> in </.> uhm
independent country or independent city

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#257:1:A>
It  ' s a colonial of British <,> <{> <[> so </[> <,> English is <,>
more important

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X258:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X259:1:Z>
Exactly but for being a British colony I don't think people speak
very good English here <{> <unc> three words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#260:1:A>
<[> But in the <.> gov </.> </[> </{> in the government in
the government department all the communication is uh English <{1> <[1> <,>
uhm </[1> because in the early time of Hong Kong the trading with the uh
foreign country like like the France and and other country is also using
English because Hong Kong is the place uh under <{2> <[2> Britain <,> so
</[2> I think the importance of English is <,> the reason behind this

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X261:1:Z>
<[1> That  ' s right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X262:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X263:1:Z>
Yeah <,> but uhm like Indian <,> people <,> they <.> s </.> they
<.> s </.> sometimes speak English to each other </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#264:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X265:1:Z>
Uhm they have been a British colony for a very long time as well
but they speak better English than the <,> Chinese in Hong Kong usually </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#266:1:A>
Indian have a better standard

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X267:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#268:1:A>
I think may may be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X269:1:Z>
Maybe because they have several Indian languages so they need a
common language uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#270:1:A>
I don't know <,> how did they <,> teach English to the in the
primary school or in the uh people when they are childhood time

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#271:1:A>
<{1> <[1> I think </[1> uhm <,> because in Hong Kong or uh Chinese
is is <,> an exception

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#272:1:A>
Uh Hong Kong <,> we start to uh learn English in around uhm
primary one I think <&> phone rings </&> except some kindergarten they have
English course <,,> <&> phone rings </&> otherwise we  ' ll all all the student
is uh ordinary will <,> learn English in primary school when they are primary
one so

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#273:1:A>
And the <,> method of teaching English is to know the vocabulary
first and know the grammar and <,> it it not have quite uh <.> man </.> many
chance to speak <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> uh what is it

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#274:1:A>
Because uh the teacher is also use Cantonese to teach English

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#275:1:A>
<{3> <[3> So I think </[3> it is <,,> it doesn't provide a a very
good place or environment for student to practice their English <{4> <[4>
throughout </[4> their their learning <,> so it is <,> the reason maybe the
Hong Kong <,> people have a a uh not very good standard in English ability

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X276:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X277:1:Z>
<[2> Uh uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X278:1:Z>
<[3> Oh really </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X279:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X280:1:Z>
Uhm that  ' s right

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X281:1:Z>
So <,,> so what do you think about uhm <,,> all the expats all
the foreigners that come to Hong Kong to work </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#282:1:A>
<unc> two words </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X283:1:Z>
All all <{> <[> the foreigners <,> </[> that come to Hong Kong to
work like all the Americans and things like that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X284:1:Z>
What do what do Chinese people think about that in general </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#285:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#286:1:A>
Uhm you mean we refuse or or accept

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#287:1:A>


<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X288:1:Z>
Uh Sort of

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X289:1:Z>
Yes yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#290:1:A>
Uh I have I I I don't think it it have a influence to local
people very much because uhm <,,> beside the foreigner that  ' s it from uh
America or Britain we have foreigner from Chinese <{1> <[1> because </[1> we
we are Hong Kong citizens we have some Chineses <,> coming to Hong Kong and
find their job <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> even the uh high-profile or low-profile
job

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X291:1:Z>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#292:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#293:1:Z>
Uh uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#294:1:A>
Uh it it cannot say the foreigner affect Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#295:1:A>
<.> In </.> <.> in </.> instead the Chinese people also so we we
cannot say uh <,> uh <,> Hong Kong citizen have a uh have <.> le le </.>
lesser working uh chance in Hong Kong because the foreigner come to uh take
our job away

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X296:1:Z>
Yeah that  ' s right

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X297:1:Z>
But still I think <,> it seems that uhm Chinese people in Hong
Kong or Hong Kong Chinese <{> <[> <,> </[> have a negative attitude to
foreigners <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X298:1:Z>
Would you agree with that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#299:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#300:1:A>
Uh what attitude

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X301:1:Z>
A negative attitude to foreigners <,,> in general </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#302:1:A>
Uhm <,,> maybe I am not a foreigner so I have no experience
about this but personally I <,> haven't aware that uh Chinese people have
negative <,> attitude to foreigner <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#303:1:A>
Maybe I am not I don't have <{> <[> so I don't </[> so I I I
haven't aware uh some people around or uh the Chinese people have a negative
attitude

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X304:1:Z>
<[> No no <&> laughs </&> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X305:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#306:1:A>
What kind of attitude do you think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X307:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#308:1:A>
It  ' s exactly a discrimination or just a attitude or <{> <[>
<,> or </[> something <,> like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X309:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X310:1:Z>
A bit uhm a bit of fear maybe </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#311:1:A>
Fear

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X312:1:Z>
Being <{> <[> afraid </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#313:1:A>
<[> Fear </[> </{> to fear to talk with the foreigner

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X314:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#315:1:A>
Oh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X316:1:Z>
And also maybe afraid because <,> we look different <,,> we are
different <,,> we say different things

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X317:1:Z>
I don't know <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> different culture and <,> and
also <,,> probably it  ' s a lot because Chinese people are shy to speak
English or <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> a lot uhm a lot of the uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X318:1:Z>
And uhm <,,> I don't know maybe they think that <,,> sometimes I
think <,> that they look down on the foreigners </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#319:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#320:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#321:1:A>
Look down

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X322:1:Z>
Yeah sorry </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-048#323:1:A>
<unc> multiple words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#324:1:A>
I think the Chinese people or Hong Kong Chinese is not uh look
down

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#325:1:A>
I think in personal idea that they are not look down

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#326:1:A>
They <,> really they are afraid because uhm the I I think the
reason is <,> the uhm guess their English ability is not good enough to
communicate with the foreigner <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#327:1:A>
Uh as uhm even they are speaking English or not <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#328:1:A>
Maybe they speak uhm Mandarin

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#329:1:A>
I I <.> al al </.> always afraid how to speak with them because my
Mandarin is not very good so uhm <,> in the Chinese culture I I I think <,>
they afraid the foreigner but they don't look down on the foreigner because
uhm in some <,> uh hotel or some shop if the foreigner come in they will have
a very <,> uhm bad bad service for the foreigner <{3> <[3> <,> but </[3> they
cannot find it in the uh uh Chinese themselves

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#330:1:A>
Maybe let  ' s say uhm <,> uh foreigner spirit is I go to the
Spaghetti House <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> and there  ' s full full house and I waited
for the uh empty place or or or or a table for uh <.> aro </.> or we have uh
two persons table for two then the foreigner come in <,> she go to open the
door <,> for the foreigner but not for Chinese <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#331:1:A>
<unc> three words </unc> for the Chinese if foreigner come
in they will open the door <{6> <[6> but </[6> not for Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#332:1:A>
I think how come

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#333:1:A>
We are Chinese but you you

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#334:1:A>
<{7> <[7> I think </[7> should be equal service or or should have
uh equality but <{8> <[8> we </[8> doesn't find that <.> e </.> equality but
foreigner is better

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#335:1:A>
<{9> <[9> Find </[9> it quite absurd

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#336:1:A>


<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X337:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-048#X339:1:Z>
