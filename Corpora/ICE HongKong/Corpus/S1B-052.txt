<O> Five words in Cantonese </O> Will the administration try to
think about some <.> admins </.> administrative guidelines for the land
resumptions in such a way that the people get the money which is sufficient
for the land <,> for the property owners to buy the reasonable flats or shops
to carry on their livelihood in the same area

Mr Deputy President

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#4:1:B>
The Secretary justified not having secretary uh guidelines by saying
that uh it has been satisfactory in the past

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#5:1:B>
Can he tell this council how many resumption cases have been
objected to in the next uh in the last five years

Mr Deputy President

In the Secretary  ' s reply on the last paragraph he said property
owners are offer compensation base on the market value of the properties

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#9:1:C>
May I ask the compensation on market value does it include not only
the premises but also the redevelopment potential of the property

Mr Acting Deputy President

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#12:1:D>
After the Omelco consensus had been dropped by the British
Government in its negotiations with the Chinese Government what was the
reason for not informing the then non-government members of this Legislative
Council of this fact since all such members had contributed to the formation
of the Omelco consensus and all of them had by virtue of such non-disclosure
been fully kept in the dark until the recent publication of the seven secret
documents

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#13:1:D>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#15:1:E>
And that is whether the Executive Council were shown all the
relevant documents that were disclose recently

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#16:1:E>
And whether in fact there are any other documents relevant to these
discussions that have not <.> ha </.> has yet been published

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#33:1:F>
Mr Deputy President

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#34:1:F>
I rise to move the motion standing in my name in the order paper
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#35:1:F>
To the extent that the Joint Declaration commanded the confidence
of Hong Kong in nineteen eighty-four it did so by offering a series of
important promises in unambiguous terms <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#36:1:F>
It promised that Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy
from the Chinese Central Government <,> that the legislature would be elected
to office <,> that Hong Kong would be invested with independent judicial
power including that of final adjudication <,> that rights and freedoms would
be protected and extended <,> and that until nineteen ninety-seven Britain
alone would be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong <,> with China
promising its cooperation in that regard <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#37:1:F>
Those were the pillars on which Hong Kong  ' s future was to rest <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#38:1:F>
Sir <,> these pillars are tottering <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#39:1:F>
They are being undermined by a force of which we were told nothing
in nineteen eighty-four <,> which made no appearance in the Joint Declaration
and which was imported by stealth into the transitional arrangements some
time between November eighty-five and January eighty-six

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#40:1:F>
The force of which I speak here is what we now call convergence

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#41:1:F>
A misleading name since it suggests a mutuality of movement by the
parties <,> deemed to be converging

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#42:1:F>
In the case of Hong Kong convergence seems only to mean what China
says it wants and that Britain after a decent interval of hesitation agrees
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#43:1:F>
We have been hypnotised by convergence <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#44:1:F>
It is a device introduce by China to serve China  ' s ends <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#45:1:F>
Convergence is not a strategy

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#46:1:F>
It is a tactic

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#47:1:F>
Yet we are told to treat it as a virtue <,> a necessity even
incredibly as a high principle <,> capable of eroding promises set down in
the Joint Declaration which we once so trustingly assumed to be sacrosanct
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#48:1:F>
Convergence is frustrating the desire of Hong Kong for the rapid
development of democratic government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#49:1:F>
It is contesting the authority of the present administration

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#50:1:F>
It mocks our expectation of a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong
after nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#51:1:F>
Why do we suffer this

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#52:1:F>
We do so because we are told that convergence is the necessary
basis for a smooth transition in nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#53:1:F>
But let me suggest otherwise

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#54:1:F>
At Britain  ' s and China  ' s behest we have been attempting to
converge with the post ninety-seven political system which as set down in the
Basic Law falls dangerously short of our standards and requirements <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#55:1:F>
I remind this council that we have already declared our support for
the Honourable Jimmy Macgregor  ' s motion on October fourteenth that the
Election Committee should be composed of the democratically elected District
Board members <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#56:1:F>
China  ' s ill-reasoned denunciation of the proposed ninety-five
Election Committee structure shows that convergence serves mainly as a useful
cover for instinctive hostility towards democratic reform <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#57:1:F>
There is then the publication on October twenty-eighth of
correspondence between the British and Chinese Foreign Ministers on the
subject of constitutional reforms in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#58:1:F>
Though these letters do not as China claims reveal a secret
agreement with Britain they do reveal an attitude towards democracy which is
scarcely less distressing <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#59:1:F>
They show that democracy in Hong Kong has been regarded by London
and by Beijing alike not as a value but as a commodity

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#60:1:F>
Something to be bartered bargained over <.> ma ma </.> managed and
exploited

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#61:1:F>
Deputy President I fear that some may accuse me of failing to
justify my argument by reference to fact <,> and to detail <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#62:1:F>
I would like therefore to remind the chamber of some of the
specific problems which will confront us during the nineteen ninety-seven
transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#63:1:F>
However <&> tape-ends </&> to innovate convergence merely makes the
situation worse <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#64:1:F>
This <?> council  ' s </?> <,> reward for converging we are told
would be the through train

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#65:1:F>
Very well

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#66:1:F>
But how then do we accommodate Article sixty-seven of the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#67:1:F>
It provides as you will remember that permanent residents of the
region who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in
foreign countries may not exceed twenty percent of the total membership of
this council <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#68:1:F>
The problem is that we do not know who will or who will not be
considered a Chinese national after nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#69:1:F>
China  ' s nationality law is too vague and untested for us to be
sure how objectively that law will or even can be applied in Hong Kong after
nineteen ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#70:1:F>
Would Article sixty-seven restrict those who can stand in all
constituencies or just in some constituencies <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#71:1:F>
Would we do better to see who was elected and then draw lots as to
who should be compelled to stand down <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#72:1:F>
And would we then hold fresh elections to fill the vacancies
starting the cycle all over again <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#73:1:F>
This is the direction in which the logic of convergence pushes us

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#74:1:F>
Is this our idea of a smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#75:1:F>
Surely it cannot be

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#76:1:F>
Article sixty-seven of the Basic Law alone makes it impossible to
reconcile the principle of convergence with the ideal of a smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#77:1:F>
Let me now proceed to another contradiction

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#78:1:F>
I remind this council of the decision that was adopted on April
fourth nineteen ninety by the National People  ' s Congress on the method for
the formation of the first government and the first Legislative Council of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#79:1:F>
It provide that members of the Legislative Council may only
continue to serve onward from nineteen ninety-seven to nineteen ninety-nine
after they have been confirmed in office by a Preparatory Committee appointed
by the Chinese Central Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#80:1:F>
The identity of this committee is still a mystery to us

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#81:1:F>
The mandate of this Preparatory Committee is not only to scrutinise
the composition of this council for conformity with the Basic Law but also to
examine the individual council members themselves <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#82:1:F>
It must ensure that only those members who uphold the Basic Law and
pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR will continue to serve before nineteen
ninety-seven <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#83:1:F>
I do not think that any of us here will have any problems pledging
allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#84:1:F>
But what does it mean to uphold the Basic Law

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#85:1:F>
Does it mean to obey the Basic Law in so far as it prescribes
particular courses of action

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#86:1:F>
Or does it mean to <?> espouse </?> the Basic Law in every detail
and not to question it

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#87:1:F>
If the latter then any member of this council who has suggested
that the Basic Law should be amended in any way has theoretically rendered
themselves vulnerable to the Preparatory Committee  ' s mandate <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#88:1:F>
The fact is this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#89:1:F>
As in all other matters of interpretation it is up to China

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#90:1:F>
They are to be decided upon by the Standing Committee of the
National People  ' s Congress <,> a body under the political control of the
Communist Party

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#91:1:F>
And because we cannot possibly forecast how the Communist Party
will choose to exercise its absolute discretion in interpreting the Basic Law
during and after ninety-seven we cannot converge in any sure verifiable way
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#92:1:F>
Some of the members elected to this council in nineteen ninety-one
may not be acceptable to China come nineteen ninety-seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#93:1:F>
Yet those same members have every prospect of being re-elected in
nineteen ninety-five if they choose to stand <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#94:1:F>
We must expect that the Preparatory Committee and perhaps the
nationality rules will then be use to block their way <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#95:1:F>
Fresh elections will presumably be inevitable

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#96:1:F>
And the possibility of a smooth transition will again be frustrated
not by any failure of convergence but by criteria invented and imposed by
China without any basis in the Joint Declaration <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#97:1:F>
If elected representatives of the people can be removed from this
council by the Preparatory Committee that would be a total abnegation of
democracy and make a mockery of the Basic Law  ' s promise in Article
sixty-eight that the ultimate aim is the election of all members of this
council by universal suffrage <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#98:1:F>
Those who say that bumping off one or two elected legislators does
not affect a <.> throos </.> does not affect a smooth transition are totally
misguided

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#99:1:F>
The Joint Declaration promised Hong Kong the freedom of speech and
the freedom of the ballot box

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#100:1:F>
Let us not be lured into conspiring against those freedoms in the
name of convergence

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#101:1:F>
Let us remain true to our beliefs and to our values

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#102:1:F>
And let us urge Britain and China alike to respect our right to do
so <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#103:1:F>
Sir I come now to the text of my motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#104:1:F>
It says nothing about convergence

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#105:1:F>
The motion looks forward to a continuing dialogue between the
British and the Chinese Government on political reform <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#106:1:F>
The motion requires that the dialogue be an open one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#107:1:F>
When the future of Hong Kong is being negotiated the people of
Hong Kong must know what is being said on their behalf

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#108:1:F>
That is a matter of right and common decency

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#109:1:F>
It should not be an occasional or accidental privilege <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#110:1:F>
The motion requires that the reforms be fair ones in which due
weight is given to the democratic wishes of Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#111:1:F>
Finally the motion requires acceptability to the people of Hong
Kong as the objective criterion for reform

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#112:1:F>
Mr Deputy President since I still have some time if I may I would
like to comment on all the amendments now because I think that may save time
later on

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#113:1:F>
Would you permit that Sir

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#X114:1:Z>
You have the right to speak to each of the amendments after the
amendments are proposed

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#X115:1:Z>
So it  ' s really your option <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc>
</[> </X>

<$F> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-052#116:1:F>
<[> I think </[> </{> it will save time perhaps if I did did
it all now <{> <[> because I  ' m conscious </[> that many speakers would like
to speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#117:1:F>
If I may I would like to carry on <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#118:1:F>
Mr Deputy President the Honourable Jimmy Macgregor  ' s amendment to
my motion is about further democratic reform for Hong Kong and supports in
general the Governor  ' s reform proposals

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#119:1:F>
I therefore support his amendment

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#120:1:F>
The honourable <unc> name </unc>  ' s amendment offers
hollow sentiment in hollow language

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#121:1:F>
I have made my arguments against convergence and against illusory
appeals to a smooth transition on that basis

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#122:1:F>
There is nothing in Mr Tsim  ' s amendment to undermine my case and
much to reinforce it

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#123:1:F>
Convergence means not merely deference to China  ' s wishes <,> but
uncritical unconstructive unthinking deference <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#124:1:F>
Such deference cannot possibly be in the long-term interest of the
people of Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#125:1:F>
The amendment is <?> thus </?> logically and politically wrong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#126:1:F>
As to the idea that discussion should be conducted on a basis of
their realistic acceptability to the people of Hong Kong I am torn between
incomprehension and disbelief

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#127:1:F>
Are we telling Hong Kong people that they have to accept whatever
is thrusted at them <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#128:1:F>
Sir <,> the people of Hong Kong understand a very great deal

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#129:1:F>
They understand much more than the Government of Britain and China
often seem to appreciate <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#130:1:F>
Mr Tsim cannot expect acquiescence

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#131:1:F>
And he certainly cannot be allowed to propose <,> it as this
council  ' s mandate <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#132:1:F>
Our problem is to secure respect for Hong Kong  ' s views <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#133:1:F>
Mr Tsim  ' s amendment is thus regressive and patronising

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#134:1:F>
It should be discarded in its entirety <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#135:1:F>
The Honourable Andrew Wong  ' s proposed amendment does not answer
unfortunately our present needs

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#136:1:F>
Of course <,> we hope that discussions between Britain and China
will be friendly ones but it would be naive to issue this proposition as our
mandate

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#137:1:F>
Discussions and negotiations of every kind have their ups and
downs <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#138:1:F>
There are periods of rapid progress and there are periods of
reflection <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#139:1:F>
If the interest of Hong Kong require that the British Government
be firm then it must be so <,> so long as it does so courteously and justly

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#140:1:F>
No offence should be given or taken <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#141:1:F>
Much of the wording of Mr Wong  ' s amendment has unfortunately been
borrowed for less noble ends in more recent years

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#142:1:F>
And I worry about the construction which might be put on Mr Wong  ' s
references to prosperity and stability and a smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#143:1:F>
These are phrases which have been appropriated by the advocates of
convergence in order to inhibit democratic reform in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#144:1:F>
Accordingly while I respect Mr Wong  ' s sentiment I cannot support
his amendments which would tend both to weaken and to confuse the message
which we  ' re trying to send

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#145:1:F>
The Honourable <unc> name </unc>  ' s amendment is a
virtuous one <,> but I am concerned that it would lead us away from the main
matter of the moment which is the principles by which Sino-British dialogue
should be conducted

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#146:1:F>
Accordingly I oppose this amendment not because I think it  ' s
wrong in principle but because I think the matter needs to be developed more
fully at another time

<ICE-HK:S1B-052#147:1:F>
With these remarks Sir I beg to move the motion with the
Honourable Jimmy Macgregor  ' s amendment </I>
