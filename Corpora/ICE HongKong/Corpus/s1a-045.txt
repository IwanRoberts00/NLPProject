<ICE-HK:S1A-045#77:1:B>
Yes so <,> so I think it  ' s not <,> good

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#78:1:B>
And also <,> it  ' ll <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> the atmosphere here <,> is

So <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#257:1:B>
Anyway

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#258:1:A>
Last week when I <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> when I went to church
<,> one of my <{2> <[2> sister </[2> ask me <,> whether I will like to go for
baptism this uh <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> this May

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#259:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#260:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X261:1:Z>
<[3> Oh </[3> </{3> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#262:1:B>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#263:1:B>
This May

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#264:1:A>
But I think

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#265:1:B>
You have to prepare your exam

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#266:1:A>
Yeah because I have to attend many class <{> <[> if I really
want to </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X267:1:Z>
<[> Yeah no time <[> </{> to attend </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#268:1:A>
Yes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#269:1:A>
But <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> really I <,> quite like the church I am
attending <{2> <[2> and I think </[2> <,> uh <,> someday I will

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#270:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#271:1:B>
<[2> Uhm <,> uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#272:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#273:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#274:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#275:1:B>
Oh I see

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#276:1:B>
How about the next <,> chance to have baptism

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#277:1:A>
Oh <,> I think it will be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X278:1:Z>
Christmas </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#279:1:A>
Perhaps

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#280:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#281:1:B>
Uhm <,,> it  ' s good I think uh <,> uh <,> it may be much better to
have uh <,> to let you <,> know more <{> <[> about </[> your church and then
you  ' ll baptise there

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#282:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#283:1:A>
Yeah and also I want to make friends <{1> <[1> with </[1> the
brother and sister <,> and I want to get <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> get to know them
more before I receive my baptism

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#284:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#285:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X286:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X287:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X288:1:B>
I see <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X289:1:B>
Why why why do you like what what uh <,> what thing <,> that uh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X290:1:A>
Attract me

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X291:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X292:1:A>
I think it <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> uh it is mainly because of
their love <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X293:1:A>
Because <{3> <[3> I </[3> <,> even though sometimes when I went
to <,> went to have fellowship with <{4> <[4> them they </[4> will play and
they will <,> uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X294:1:A>
They will play and <,> it seems that they don't have deep
relationship <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X295:1:A>
But <,> uh <,> I discover that it is not the case because uh <{6>
<[6> <,> </[6> last week they went for a camp and in the camp they pray
together <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> and they have very deep sharing and they cry
together because uhm <,> they discover that there are sins in themselves

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X296:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X297:1:B>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X298:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X299:1:B>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X300:1:B>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X301:1:B>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X302:1:B>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X303:1:B>
Oh

<$A> And <,> I discover <,> I discover that there are other aspects of them
<,> that <,,> that are really brother and sister <{1> <[1> <,> uh </[1> just
like the <{2> <[2> environment here <,> </[2> but I think the

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X304:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X305:1:B>
<[2> Uhm <,> uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X306:1:B>
They are much they  ' re <{> <[> <,> <unc> one-word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X307:1:Z>
<[> Did you go </[> </{> for the camp </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#308:1:A>
No originally I would I would like to go but because <,> oh
because I have many projects to finish <{1> <[1> so </[1> <,> I <{2> <[2>
cannot </[2> afford to go

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X309:1:Z>
<[1> Oh yeah </[1> </{1> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#310:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#311:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#312:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#313:1:A>
And also I think they are very welcome

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#314:1:B>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#315:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#316:1:A>
And <,> I really enjoy the <,> morning praise and worship
with them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X317:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#318:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#319:1:A>
The style is very similar to CCC <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> they
also use transparency <{2> <[2> and most of the songs </[2> they sing I also
know <{3> <[3> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#320:1:A>
And </[3> I think they are very alive and very <,> uh energetic
when they sing a song <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#321:1:A>
For example they will do many action

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#322:1:B>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#323:1:B>
<[2> Uhm <,> uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#324:1:B>
<[3> Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#325:1:B>
<unc> two-words </unc> </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#326:1:B>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

Uhm <{> <[> <,> uhm </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#328:1:A>
<[> And they </[> </{> will clap their hands

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#329:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#330:1:A>
And <,,> and also sometimes uh they will invite some of the
brother and sister to <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> share their personal experience
<{2> <[2> on </[2> uh <,> on uh sharing the gospel or helping the new
believer to get to know more about God

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#331:1:A>
And <,> I think I will <,> I think this church can help me to know
God more even after I <,> graduate from this <,> school

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#332:1:A>
And also I <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> personally I think I can <,> be
used by God in this church <{4> <[4> because </[4> the main objective of this
church is quite similar to

gospel with with uh the people in Cheung Chau <{2> <[2> or </[2> <,> or to
uhm <,> help help new believer to get to know more about god

<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X357:2:Z>

in Japanese company </[1> so that I can use the uhm Japanese I have learned

Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#420:2:A>
Uh actually there are there are many different kinds of ways

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X442:2:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X443:2:Z>
And do you like <foreign> na ni </foreign> uh the student
university student can teach there <{1> <[1> or </[1> with their <.> tra </.>
training <{2> <[2> or without </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#444:2:A>
<[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#445:2:A>
<[2> No </[2> </{2> <{> <[> <,> they did without </[> training

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X446:2:Z>
<[> Wo wo </[> </{> so <{> <[> aw </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#447:2:A>
<[> In Japan </[> </{> they need to be trained

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X448:2:Z>
Uh usually home tutor they don't have any training <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> but the you know there are many institute uh or <.> cra </.> cram cram
cram school there <{2> <[2> <,> there are </[2> many cram schools and the the
competition uh among the are really strict so they have to train the teachers
<{3> <[3> <,> so </[3> uhm uhm I think it  ' s uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#449:2:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#450:2:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm cram school </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#451:2:A>
<[3> Oh so </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#452:2:A>
It  ' s very <{> <[> different </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X453:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X454:2:Z>
It  ' s not very difficult but it  ' s not very easy of

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X455:2:Z>
Uhm beside there are many universities in Japan so of course
there are more university students in Japan uh than Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X456:2:Z>
Uh there are only six universities in Hong Kong <{> <[> and </[>
so university students are prestigious in Hong Kong but in Japan are you were
you university student and so what like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#457:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#458:2:A>
Everyone is

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X459:2:Z>
Yeah everyone is so uhm it <{> <[> <?> soon </?> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#460:2:A>
<[> But it </[> </{> depends on the uh fame of that
university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X461:2:Z>
Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X462:2:Z>
Yes it depends uhm so uhm like Tokyo University <{1> <[1> uh and
they </[1> so they I think they are easy to find that kind of job

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X463:2:Z>
Uh uhm so uhm and uh but uh I I think uh <.> al </.> they are
also many universities student do they are doing part-time job like uh
McDonald  ' s <{2> <[2> <,> clerk </[2> or uhm <foreign> ahno </foreign> <.> fa
</.> the restaurant waiter or waitress

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X464:2:Z>
So but I think who there are are few students university student
they  ' re doing that kind of job <{3> <[3> they they are that <,> ho ho ho
</[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#465:2:A>
<[1> Uhm of course it is the best </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#466:2:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#467:2:A>
<[3> Yes but the salary is very low yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#468:2:A>
Uh as for for those who as in McDonald <{1> <[1> <,> the </[1>
salary is about fifteen <{2> <[2> or </[2> eighteen dollars <{3> <[3> per
hour </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X469:2:Z>


<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X470:2:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X471:2:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X472:2:Z>
<[3> Fifteen </[3> </{3> <{> <[> <foreign> honto </foreign> very
low </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#473:2:A>
<[> One five one eight per per hour </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#474:2:A>
But as for us if we work as a tutor <{1> <[1> then </[1> plus a
zero

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#475:2:A>
<{2> <[2> A hundred and fifty </[2> which is <{3> <[3> <,> ten
</[3> times more

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#476:2:A>
So we seldom <{4> <[4> do that in McDonald  ' s </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X477:2:Z>


<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X478:2:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X479:2:Z>
<[2> Aw right right right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X480:2:Z>
<[3> So ten ten times aw </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X481:2:Z>
<[4> But I think do doing </[4> </{4> a tutor you have to prepare
for them as or you do not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#482:2:A>
Uh <{1> <[1> for me it depends on </[1> the standard <{2>
<[2> of the child </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#483:2:A>
If he is really not very good <{3> <[3> then I have to </[3> get
<{4> <[4> more some more exercise for him </[4> but for for those students in
Hong Kong usually they are not really <{5> <[5> bad </[5> but their parents
are just simply too <{6> <[6> anxious about their results so </[6> find a
tutor <{7> <[7> to help him </[7> more

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X484:2:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X485:2:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X486:2:Z>

<[6> Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X490:2:Z>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7> uhm sometimes you can't get bonus from the
parents when they <{> <[> took it <unc> one-word </unc> good uhm
right </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#491:2:A>
<[> Uh bonus not really bonus but uh for example </[> </{> if
in times of Christmas <{1> <[1> than </[1> I may have a Christmas present
<{2> <[2> or </[2> uhm in times of <{3> <[3> the </[3> Lunar Year then I will
have the red packet <{4> <[4> <,> yeah </[4>

<{> <[> Wow </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X502:2:Z>
<[> Uhm I think so but this is </[> </{> all very how to say a
kind of legend <{1> <[1> not the true story legend I think </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X503:2:Z>
May be but in sometimes we can get some present uh when the
pupils uh <foreign> na ni </foreign> got uh got the new good uh good grade
but the you know the <foreign> na ni </foreign> season of the examination how
to say we have summer cake <{2> <[2> during that </[2> during <{3> <[3> that
time don't </[3> you think so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#504:2:A>
<[1> Aw </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X508:2:Z>
Oh you are now so responsible then

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X509:2:Z>
Uhm uh we used to <{> <[> uhm right </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#510:2:A>
<[> <?> So I </?> </[> </{> uh may be uhm my student right
now <{1> <[1> the one student </[1> I  ' m having right now uhm is not that he
doesn't <{2> <[2> study in the </[2> very famous uh school <{3> <[3> so </[3>
the pressure <{4> <[4> is not that much </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#511:2:A>
But for the previous <{5> <[5> student </[5> he  ' s studying in uhm
La Salle <{6> <[6> primary school <.> wh </.> which is a very famous school
in Hong Kong </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#512:2:A>
And actually there  ' s no particular season of <{7> <[7>
examination because </[7> every week he got <{8> <[8> every three quizzes
</[8> and one month then <{9> <[9> he will have the big test </[9> so every
every so I  ' m I accustomed <{10> <[10> to to this kind of </[10>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X513:2:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X514:2:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X516:2:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X517:2:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X522:2:Z>
<[10> Uhm uhm uhm </[10> </{10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X523:2:Z>
And you you also has that kind of experience when you were in
that age <{> <[> right I assume </[> and you want that I assume uh uhm uh uh
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#524:2:A>
<[> Yeah yeah similar </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#525:2:A>
Actually I accustomed <{> <[> this yeah <,> I think </[> is it the
same case in Japan because

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X526:2:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm oh I see </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X527:2:Z>
Uh the competition <{1> <[1> among </[1> the <{2> <[2> student
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X528:2:Z>
Yes they are

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X529:2:Z>
Uh you know the entrance examination of universities are really
competitive uhm uhm so yes and the to enter the prestigious university then
you have to uh enter the <{3> <[3> <.> en </.> enter </[3> the good high
school uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X530:2:Z>
And to enter the good high school to enter you you have to to
enter the good <{4> <[4> primary school </[4> like that so it  ' s it  ' s
hierarchy that <{5> <[5> kind </[5> of

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X531:2:Z>
So uhm yup uhm but after the entrance examination then they want
they they they want to uh they then they how how to say they don't want to
study more anymore <{6> <[6> a kind of a uhm </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X532:2:Z>
Uhm yeah somehow uhm but normally its in my days uh is uh how to
say enjoyable I mean in the university the we we really enjoy not worry about
but now the uh how to say to for a for the university student it is its
really difficult to find a job in in Japan <{7> <[7> now </[7> because uh
Japanese economy is not very good now so uhm so I think they have to study or
they have to get some uh qualification or certification <{8> <[8> of </[8>
some business <{9> <[9> skills </[9> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#533:2:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#534:2:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#535:2:A>
<[3> Enter high school </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#536:2:A>
<[4> Primary school </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#537:2:A>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#538:2:A>
<[6> Because tired of study </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#539:2:A>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#540:2:A>
<[8> Uhm </[8> </{8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#541:2:A>
<[9> Professional </[9> </{9>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X542:2:Z>
Yes the professional skills

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X543:2:Z>
So I think they are studying more than </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#544:2:A>
Before

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X545:2:Z>
Before uhm much more than uhm <{> <[> uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#546:2:A>
<[> Now </[> </{> I think <{1> <[1> its </[1> also the same
case in Hong Kong cos really the unemployment <{2> <[2> rate is </[2> very
high recently

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#547:2:A>
So and there are increasing number of universities graduates <{3>
<[3> so it  ' s very also difficult for Hong Kong students </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X548:2:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X549:2:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X550:2:Z>
<[3> Aw uhm uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X551:2:Z>
Uhm uhm so you  ' re in third year now so you already started

<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#554:2:A>
<[> I have </[> </{> uh quite a number of application <.> fo

<[4> Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

Uh so usually to find jobs uh as you were a the how to say
freshman in the uh I mean <.> na ni </.> uh you are just going to graduate so
you don't have uh business experience right

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X560:2:Z>

<{> <[> or something </[> </X>

Is it the same case in Japan

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X580:2:Z>
Uhm officially <{1> <[1> it  ' s </[1> really open

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X581:2:Z>
But official open but they how to say all the students know there
are many how to say not not official ways you know uh how <{2> <[2> it  ' s
difficult </[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#582:2:A>
<[1> Officially </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#583:2:A>
<[2> Not official ways </[2> </{2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X584:2:Z>
That mean <{> <[> uh </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#585:2:A>
<[> Through relationship </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X586:2:Z>
Through relationship uh yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X587:2:Z>
Not uhm of course they are of course they are open how to say
examination were <foreign> na ni </foreign> uh <foreign> a noo </foreign> uhm
yup but the uhm I don't know how how many percent but the <foreign> memo a su
</foreign> uhm many part of the job <foreign> na ni </foreign> seeker they
find their jobs through their their parents <.> rela </.> relationships <{1>
<[1> or </[1> who were the the <.> el </.> elder students <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
of their own own university <{3> <[3> <,> uhm </3> and yes through that kind
of relationship they ask them to introduce someone in charge and </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#588:2:A>
<{1> <[1> Uh huh </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#589:2:A>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#590:2:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#591:2:A>
Aw <{> <[> it  ' s really good </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X592:2:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X593:2:Z>
So yes so uhm so sometimes it  ' s a it works <{1> <[1> I mean
</[1> uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X594:2:Z>
Uhm uhm really uhm <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> yes because of course
there are many open area <{3> <[3> uhm </[3> but the uhm they how to say I I
mean the companies they want have some guarantee to <foreign> na ni
</foreign> to hire new person so <{4> <[4> you </[4> know this person so you
want to have some guarantee <{5> <[5> so </[5> if they <foreign> na ni
</foreign> find some person through the relationships then <{6> <[6> uhm uhm
like that </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X595:2:Z>
So I think uhm of course there are some some students uhm yeah
their parents or their relatives are very powerful in the society <{7> <[7>
like that </[7> so-called the this kind of <foreign> na ni </foreign> uhm
relationship work will help in <{8> <[8> uh uhm </[8> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#596:2:A>
<[1> It works </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#597:2:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#598:2:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#599:2:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#600:2:A>
<[5> Uh uh </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#601:2:A>
<[6> Since somebody know them better

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#602:2:A>
Oh I see </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#603:2:A>
<[7> Uh huh </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#604:2:A>
<[8> But which one is </[8> </{8> not common

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X605:2:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#606:2:A>
<[> Through relationship or through those open area </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X607:2:Z>
Open uh through the open ways should be more advantage <{1> <[1>
uhm </[1> but you know there are no actual uh <foreign> na ni </foreign> <{2>
<[2> statistics about </[2> this because they don't don't they don't tell
them uh <{3> <[3> about that </[3> so uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X608:2:Z>
But uh I think yah I think uh men men the male students they can
<foreign> na ni </foreign> they <.> e </.> they are is it easier to them to
find <{4> <[4> the </[4> job through the open way I think but to for female
student I think uhm I think some time they have to relay on this kind of <{5>
<[5> <,> relationships </[5> uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#609:2:A>
<[1> Yah yah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#610:2:A>
<[2> Yah yah yah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#611:2:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#612:2:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#613:2:A>
<[5> Relationship </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#614:2:A>
Is it really that uh women is very difficult to find job in Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#615:2:A>
<{> <[> Much difficult than men </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X616:2:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> generally yes uhm but uhm <foreign> so ne
</foreign> much much better than before uhm <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X617:2:Z>
So because there there are many capable <{2> <[2> uhm </[2> woman
now uhm I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X618:2:Z>
Uhm yeah uhm so yeah somehow different but uh usually it is said
that uh <.> Jap </.> in in Japan there are hard discrimination among uh women

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X619:2:Z>
But uh I think it  ' s a it  ' s how to say it  ' s uh a kind of <.> st
</.> stereotype <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> uhm information uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X620:2:Z>
They yeah we we do have that kind of discrimination but it  ' s not
the that simple I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X621:2:Z>
Uhm because some woman really want to be in domestic in the house
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4> want they want

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X622:2:Z>
It  ' s not discrimination so uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X623:2:Z>
Of course someone there are somebody they doesn't want want be in
uh they don't want to be in home <{5> <[5> but </[5> but they cannot find a
job but to uhm it  ' s not really simple <{6> <[6> uhm </[6> I think

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X624:2:Z>
<foreign> Hai </foreign> yah I sometimes I think be I am
embarrassed yah people <{7> <[7> you know </[7> not Japanese this is Hong
Kong people <{8> <[8> or American </[8> people they say in in Japan the
females uh women is very poor or something about that

<ICE-HK:S1A-045#X625:2:Z>
I don't think so <{9> <[9> it  ' s </[9> not very simple uhm uhm uh
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-045#626:2:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>
