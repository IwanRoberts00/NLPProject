<ICE-HK:S2A-002#1:1:A>
Well a very good evening and welcome to the Macau Jockey Club  ' s
Taipo racecourse of course Tuesday night  ' s sand racing <,> ten events on the
surface at the moment runners behind the barriers for the second event <,>
the Ligurian Handicap <,> class six gallopers over a thousand and fifty
metres

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#2:1:A>
Race one of course has already been completed

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#3:1:A>
We will bring you a replay in around fifteen minutes <,> and for
this second event the early favourite number six Yes Boss by Stephen Chow

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#4:1:A>
And Louis Corrales <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#5:1:A>
I tell you what as I speak <,> I  ' m predicting he  ' s he  ' s a late
scratching

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#6:1:A>
He is in fact <,> so about to come through on your screens number
six Yes Boss a late scratching <,> now <,> as we came to air I can tell you
he certainly was in the field and the favourite for the race <,> but
obviously something amiss there and <,> Yes Boss a late withdrawal out of
this second event <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#7:1:A>
So the night starting really with a bang <,> the favourite out of
race number two

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#8:1:A>
Ah just quickly our commentators  '  selections Franko Lau <,> did go
<,> number six to win but that leaves now ten King Warrior on top <,> to
defeat four New Hero and five Golden Apple

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#9:1:A>
Harry Troy four seven <,> and five

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#10:1:A>
New Hero to defeat No Money No Honey

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#11:1:A>
and Golden Apple now gets a gurnsey in third Myself don't like the
race <,> so I thought uh number seven No Money No Honey uh <,> I certainly
put him on top before the scratching of Yes Boss cos he was terrific value
and <,> I thought the favourite was under the odds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#12:1:A>
Uh I think New Hero uh is a chance but wouldn't have him as
favourite <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#13:1:A>
King Warrior is only uh horse I  ' d be rating a tierce chance in the
race <,> not the winner

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#14:1:A>
And he  ' s second favourite at nine to two <,> so I just thought No
Money No Honey was the way to go and hard to see why Golden Apple uh is a
double figure quote <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#15:1:A>
He  ' s won his past two previous grade

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#16:1:A>
On those occasions he did jump from barrier one and tonight a
different kettle of fish from barrier twelve but <,> uh I tell you what <,>
he  ' s won two-in-a-row and this isn't a very strong race

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#17:1:A>
He uh actually uh <,> the way he  ' s uh burned the sand uh his past
couple of starts <,> barrier twelve he should at least be able to get in <,>
get in <,> somewhere near the lead <,> so he  ' s a silly price

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#18:1:A>
I just like seven from five uh first two favourites are pretty much
layable for me although New Hero uh showed a lot of speed last start but he
will have to do a lot of work from barrier nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#19:1:A>
Quickly the changes tonight just repeating <,> the favourite in
race two number six Yes Boss is a late withdrawal and a riding change in race
two <,> Jubilation is now to be ridden by Chris Maund <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#20:1:A>
Number three is Chris Maund

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#21:1:A>
Now we get the blue light for the second event

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#22:1:A>
Race three another riding change Chiu Wah Best also Chris Maund <,>
uh takes the ride there <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#23:1:A>
Race four number eight God Speed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#24:1:A>
The new rider is Hiden Cheung <,> H K Cheung aboard number eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#25:1:A>
Race five and six are clear of changes

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#26:1:A>
Race seven a withdrawal <,> one Leung Shan Min is out <,> replaced
by the standby Be A Good Horse barrier nine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#27:1:A>
Charlie C F Chan take  ' s that ride

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#28:1:A>
Race eight <,> Summer Fly is out <,> no changes there <,> or sorry
no replacements there <,> so race eight number four Summer Fly withdrawal <,>
race nine is clear and in the ten <,> number four Sparky has been withdrawn
<,> again no replacements <,> race ten number four Sparky

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#29:1:A>
Shouldn't be too far away from the start in race two <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#30:1:A>
Just repeating Franko Lau has gone ten four and five <,> Harry Troy
four seven five <,> and I thought No Money No Honey uh was the horse to beat
from Golden Apple uh but he has now come down to seven to two No Money No
Honey <,> and he needs to jump out of the gates but he  ' s got a good rider
aboard in Danny Beasley so if he can get him out and running he  ' s obviously
a chance seven from five

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#31:1:A>
Uh not a race I  ' d like to have a third selection in <?> Sydney
</?> because uh yeah I  ' d rate New Hero a chance <,> but it should be a far
bigger price than what he is the same case for King Warrior

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#32:1:A>
I  ' ve actually selected him to run some big races at big odds
recently but <,> uh only uh at at forty-nine dollars fifty you could only
really rate him a tierce chance in the race not the winner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#33:1:A>
So <,> again you  ' re taking certainly uh short odds about a few of
these <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#34:1:A>
So shouldn't be too far away from the red light for race two

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#35:1:A>
Just repeating in around ten minutes we  ' ll bring you a replay of
the first race tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#36:1:A>
I  ' m the captain Steve Mooney <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#37:1:A>
We  ' ll be joined a little later on tonight by Franko Lau <,> but
first of all <,> it  ' s a very good evening to our race caller for tonight as
we get the red light <,> Harry Troy <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-002#38:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#39:1:B>
Very pleasant night for racing here at the Taipo track

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#40:1:B>
Now they are starting to load for the second of the evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#41:1:B>
Favourite number four New Hero jumps from gate nine <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#42:1:B>
Early favourite was number six Yes Boss <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#43:1:B>
He was a late scratching <,> scratched at the barrier

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#44:1:B>
So a field of eleven to do battle <,,> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#45:1:B>
And good support late for No Money No Honey <,> number five Golden
Apple was around fifteen twenty to one

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#46:1:B>
He  ' s down to four point nine now <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#47:1:B>
A winner of his past two

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#48:1:B>
Can he make it three on end <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#49:1:B>
He  ' s got a wide gate to contend with <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#50:1:B>
And they  ' re off and running <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#51:1:B>
No speed in the early part was Grand Duke <,> Jubilation got back
and likewise Win Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#52:1:B>
Golden Apple not that well away tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#53:1:B>
Now coming out in front as they settle into stride is Major Moves
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#54:1:B>
He  ' s taken on by Forex Supreme <,> hard ridden with the whip New
Hero going up to sit outside the leader <,> and Golden Apple whizzing across
from that wide alley now to be in a line of three for the lead

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#55:1:B>
No Money No Honey has got over okay <,> travels in fourth as they
go by the six hundred

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#56:1:B>
On the back of uh No Money No Honey was King Warrior <,> followed
then by a little bit deep Win Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#57:1:B>
He  ' s done plenty of work

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#58:1:B>
Followed then by midfield Major Moves followed by Leun Yat Dynamite
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#59:1:B>
Dropping out very quickly handsome Boy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#60:1:B>
Second last Jubilation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#61:1:B>
Grand Duke the tailender

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#62:1:B>
On to the Corner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#63:1:B>
On the inside we  ' ve got New Hero now just being shaded by Golden
Apple <,> popped the question No Money No Honey <,> just behind them Forex
Supreme <,> and running a bit of a race Major Moves

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#64:1:B>
Two hundred out <,> No Money No Honey raced up and dashed to the
front <,> trying to go with him Golden Apple <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#65:1:B>
Running on fairly King Warrior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#66:1:B>
Win Win down the outside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#67:1:B>
Major Moves held up

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#68:1:B>
But getting <?> away home </?> No Money No Honey and No Money No
Honey scores <?> two on the wire </?> King Warrior

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#69:1:B>
Major Moves runs third

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#70:1:B>
Close up then was Win Win followed then by weakening away Golden
Apple <,> Forex Supreme <,> disappointing New Hero followed then by Grand
Duke

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#71:1:B>
Next to pull up was Leun Yat Dynamite followed by Jubilation <,>
and a long and lonely last was Handsome Boy <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#72:1:B>
A nice ride <,> from a wide gate No Money No Honey slotted across
nicely just sat off the speed <,> and got to the front inside the final <,>
one fifty and has finished the race up a littler bit too well for them

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#73:1:B>
Danny Beasley <,> kicking the evening off with a winner

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#74:1:B>
Now King Warrior gets into second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#75:1:B>
Major Moves pretty good run by him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#76:1:B>
Best run ever on the sand in fact his first placing in around
nineteen goes <,> and he runs on well for third

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#77:1:B>
Not too far away was Win Win <,> and in the black cap Golden Apple
just weakening away a touch <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#78:1:B>
Seven was the winner No Money No Honey

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#79:1:B>
Put the writing on the wall last start I felt when he had a very
tough run <,> at one stage seven and eight deep <,> and still managed to
close <?> up </?> and finish the race off okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#80:1:B>
Tonight a bit more luck <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#81:1:B>
He  ' s ridden just off the speed

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#82:1:B>
He  ' s been a bit too good for them

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#83:1:B>
Number seven No Money No Honey is the winner at seven ten eight and
one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#84:1:B>
And No Money No Honey a six-year-old dark brown American-bred
gelding by Theatre Critic <,> from the Lydian mare Daffodil Bed

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#85:1:B>
Danny Beasley <,> has gotten off to a terrific start here at the
Taipo track

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#86:1:B>
I think that is win number seven for him and <,> he  ' s given this a
lovely ride

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#87:1:B>
Number ten is second King Warrior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#88:1:B>
Robbie Burke <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#89:1:B>
William Lai

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#90:1:B>
Number eight Major Moves <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#91:1:B>
Andy Tsang for Alan Ngai <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#92:1:B>
Bit of value going into the tierce there

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#93:1:B>
And Win Win <,> first time down in the class six ranks <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#94:1:B>
That  ' s probably his best sand run and James Chio rode number one
Win Win for Johnny Chan <,> at fourth is going to be his lot

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#95:1:B>
We  ' ve got seven ten eight and one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#96:1:B>
It  ' s two lengths by three quarters as we wait the time and the
dividends

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-002#97:1:A>
Good win by No Money No Honey <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#98:1:A>
He  ' s a horse that can miss the start quite badly but was
positioned just behind the speed and they went a little quick also

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#99:1:A>
In the straight Danny Beasley just popping him out <,> and he  ' s
gone to the line to win very easily

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#100:1:A>
No Money No Honey victorious from King Warrior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#101:1:A>
Running in third of course Major Moves

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#102:1:A>
Dividends now through

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#103:1:A>
seventy-seven dollars the win

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#104:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#105:1:A>
Eighteen dollars the place

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#106:1:A>
Ten King Warrior returning twenty dollars and fifty cents <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#107:1:A>
Number eight Major Moves running third at forty-five dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#108:1:A>
The quinella of seven and ten <,> eighty-eight dollars and a seven
ten eight tierce <,> two thousand six hundred and twenty-nine dollars the
dividend there

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#109:1:A>
Two lengths by three quarters of a length <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#110:1:A>
One O five point eight the run time

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#111:1:A>
No Money No Honey gets out to a good quote close to the off <,>
number seven returns seventy-seven dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#112:1:A>
We are heading to a break

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#113:1:A>
We  ' ll be back to <&> commercial-break </&> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#114:1:A>
We are still awaiting the weighed-in sign for race number two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#115:1:A>
Seven ten and eight were the numbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#116:1:A>
No Money No Honey <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#117:1:A>
That  ' s his fourth career sand win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#118:1:A>
Actually his eighth win in Macau <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#119:1:A>
You can show you can show something if you have a lower grade
horse that can can continue to race okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#120:1:A>
That puts No Money No Honey  ' s earnings over one point two million
dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#121:1:A>
Uh he  ' s just uh a handy bit of uh money for a lower grade
galloper <,> adding of course eighty thousand dollars in prizemoney winnings
this evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#122:1:A>
Win number eight in Macau for No Money No Honey <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#123:1:A>
Joe Murphy and Danny Beasley <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#124:1:A>
And we now have the weighed-in sign <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#125:1:A>
Seventy-seven dollars the win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#126:1:A>
Eighteen dollars the place

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#127:1:A>
The <unc> word </unc> King Warrior number ten <,> twenty
dollars fifty and

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#128:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#130:1:A>
The tierce two thousand six hundred and twenty-nine

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#131:1:A>
Two lengths by three quarters <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#132:1:A>
One O five point eight the run time

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#133:1:A>
As they now <,> as we now have a look at the head-on replay <,>
New Hero uh took the pace uh but he was uh found wanting over the extra fifty
metres tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#134:1:A>
Also there was King Warrior <,> but No Money No Honey in that
purple cap <,> he  ' s kept driven forward by Danny Beasley and <,> really
there was nothing coming out of the pack really to attack him

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#135:1:A>
Uh Major Moves maybe a bit unlucky there in the pink cap <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#136:1:A>
He didn't get through until the final stages

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#137:1:A>
And <,> Win Win uh gets through late to grab fourth position

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#138:1:A>
Uh not really to much else to speak of out of the race I  ' d have
to say <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-002#139:1:B>
And let  ' s have a look at the getaway <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#140:1:B>
Off and running <,> and getting in the air a touch at the start
was Jubilation

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#141:1:B>
He got back with Grand Duke

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#142:1:B>
Win Win was slow away <,> and likewise Golden Apple

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#143:1:B>
Now No Money No Honey the eventual winner <,> that  ' s him in
midfield in the white cap <,> rather the purple cap <,> the light colours <,>
and he just gradually works across <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#144:1:B>
By the time they get to the first corner he  ' s two and three deep
<,> and then even manages to get a little closer to the rail after that

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#145:1:B>
But as they settle into stride we  ' ve got Forex Supreme being
shaded by <,> on the outside <,> Golden Apple and New Hero

<ICE-HK:S2A-002#146:1:B>
No Money No Honey now just <,> with the drop on them <,> traveling
nicely for Beasley in third spot </I>
