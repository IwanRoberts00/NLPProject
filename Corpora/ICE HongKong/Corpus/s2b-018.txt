In London senior Exco member Baroness Lydia Dunn has warned
Britain against pressuring China into increasing the number of directly
elected Legco seats in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#2:1:A>
She was speaking at a motion debate at the House of Lords

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#3:1:A>
The motion was moved by former Hong Kong Governor Lord Maclehose

Daphne Tse reports from London <O> report by Daphne Tse and speech
by Lord Maclehose </O>

<$Z> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-018#5:1:Z>
A working relationship with China is not something we in Hong
Kong <,> can afford to see turned on and turned off according to political
need or diplomatic whims or editorial pressure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#6:1:Z>
For we the people of Hong Kong <,> have to live with the
consequences <O> continued by Daphne Tse and a speech by Baroness Chalker
followed by a report by May Wong </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-018#7:1:B>
That surprise us and even shock us to a great extent because by
doing so how can the people like her fight for the interests of people in
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#8:1:B>
And uh <.> a </.> according to a lot of public opinion poll <,>
people in Hong Kong does want a a further pace of democracy uh more directly
elected seat in nineteen ninety-five <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#9:1:B>
It is a right thing for Hong Kong and I think we should fight for it
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#10:1:B>
Whether we should get <,> it at the end of the day is another
matter

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-018#11:1:C>
I agree with the uh both the sentiment and the substance of uh
what Baroness Dunn said in her speech <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#12:1:C>
Uhm I think that it  ' s no <.> dou </.> doubt about it that we are
going through a very crucial period in our development <,> and it is very
important <,> that we try to uhm limit or eliminate <,> uhm as far as
possible the differences <,> and uh come to some uh agreement as to <,> how
we should move forward

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-018#13:1:D>
I don't think it  ' s a right right uh position for a British
Government to do it

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#14:1:D>
And second thing is that I think uh the Basic Law is the the things
belong to the Chinese Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#15:1:D>
I think as a foreign countries the more active uh the British the
role play the more problem that will create

<ICE-HK:S2B-018#16:1:D>
