Dearest Joyce ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#2:1>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#3:1>
Guess where I am now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#4:1>
O.K . <O> two-Chinese-characters </O> !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#5:1>
I  ' m in a lecture room waiting for my psyc 300 prof .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#6:1>
He  ' s a Greek .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#7:1>
This is an abnormal psychology course , and we are going to watch a
video on interview with some patients today .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#8:1>
Oops , here he comes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#9:1>
Now the film has started , the first patient is an obsessive
compulsive patient i.e. those people who cannot get some persistent but
disturbing thoughts out of their minds &ampersand; those who engage in some
repetitive activities in a stereotyped manner &obrack; e.g. keeps on washing
hands etc &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#10:1>
Well , you may be wondering why I can still write to you while
watching the video .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#11:1>
The fact is I don't have to jot notes , this video is not going to be
tested .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#12:1>
We merely watch it for interest sake .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#13:1>
Whoops !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#14:1>
Now we get another patient &longdash; a transsexual i.e. man who
dresses in woman  ' s clothes to get stimulation/pleasure .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#15:1>
Weird , isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#16:1>
By the way , if my prof doesn't tell us that &ldquo; she &rdquo; is a
transsexual , I  ' d have thought that &ldquo; she &rdquo; is a woman , a
pretty one , too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#17:1>
Alright , so much for the video .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#18:1>
I don't want to bore you to death <ul> or </ul> make you think that I  ' m
ABNORMAL ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#19:1>
I bet Irene has already told you much about our weekly activities/gatherings .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#20:1>
We all look forward <del> <?> to </?> </del> Friday every week , coz
we can bust loose for a while amidst all the chaos &ampersand; school work
&ampersand; mid terms !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#21:1>
Also , if it is not for them &obrack; Winky &ampersand; Irene
&cbrack; , I may not have the initiative to find someone to play
tennis/golf w/ me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#22:1>
So you see , our activities are really <O> four-Chinese-characters
</O> !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#23:1>
Heard from Irene that you don't have classes on a couple of days per
week !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#24:1>
How lucky you are !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#25:1>
But I know that <O> one-Chinese-character </O> Joyce <O>
several-Chinese-characters </O> , even if you get days off , you  ' ll do some
really productive things instead of sleep , sleep , &ampersand; sleep , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#26:1>
As for me , I don't have any day off this term .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#27:1>
In fact , I  ' m much busier this school year , I also feel more
pressure .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#28:1>
This doesn't seem to be the case for most 4 <ul> th </ul> yr student
, coz during the final year of bachelor degree , normally people are really
<O> two-Chinese-characters </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#29:1>
Some of my friends only have 21/24 credits , including Winky Lai .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#30:1>
Yet I have a full course load &longdash; 30 credits .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#31:1>
In addition , I  ' m doing research as a volunteer researcher for a
psyc prof .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#32:1>
He  ' s a Greek &ampersand; has a super long name &longdash;
Hadjistavro-polis .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#33:1>
Try to pronounce it some time !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#34:1>
He  ' s conducting a large research project which aims finding if blind
people hold the same stereotypes as people with sight .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#35:1>
I  ' m responsible for coding , scoring and some other computer stuff .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#36:1>
4 of us are working for him , all psyc students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#37:1>
It  ' s a pretty interesting job , and the best thing is I can ask the
prof to write reference for me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#38:1>
The video is going to be finished within 5 mins , so I gotta stop
now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#39:1>
I don't think you have received my previous letter , have you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#40:1>
<-> Probaby </-> <+> Probably </+> <O> three-Chinese-characters </O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#41:1>
Anyway , I  ' ll say thank you again for your little gifts .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#42:1>
I have a <O> blank </O> midterm &obrack; a final one &cbrack; next
week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#43:1>
Write to you again after it !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#44:1>
Take care ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#45:1>
Love, <O> A smiling face </O>

Dear Nancy ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#52:2>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#53:2>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#54:2>
I  ' m glad to hear from you again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#55:2>
I hope you can forgive me for being so lazy to write .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#56:2>
Anyway , let me offer you my <-> congraulations </-> <+>
congratulations </+> on your success in getting the driving licence .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#57:2>
I feel it is great because when I go to Australia , you can drive me
out everywhere , won't you ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#58:2>
I feel a bit surprise to hear that you don't know what subjects I
am studying in the University because I am in my final year now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#59:2>
I  ' m responsible about that because I forgot to tell you but I think
your dad  ' ll tell you something about me because my mummy told me that he has
asked the same question and she has answered it for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#60:2>
Anyway , I am majoring in English and minoring in Psychology .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#61:2>
Besides , I also took some Mandarin and Japanese courses .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#62:2>
How about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#63:2>
Do you learn Chinese ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#64:2>
I think Chinese is becoming more and more important nowadays .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#65:2>
You  ' ve already finished your first year Uni  ' s life , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#66:2>
Do you like it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#67:2>
Have you joined any students activities ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#68:2>
Tell me something about this next time please . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#69:2>
In the summer vacation this year , I have been to Europe with two
dorm-mates .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#70:2>
The whole trip lasted for about 45 days , we went to nine countries
altogether including France , Holland , Germany , Austria , <-> Chez </-> <+>
Czech </+> , Hungary , <-> Switerland </-> <+> Switzerland </+> , Italy and
Greece .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#71:2>
The country I like most is <-> Switerland </-> <+> Switzerland </+>
because <del> the </del> I love the beautiful scenery there esp. in the small
towns .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#72:2>
I  ' ve been to the Alps , I felt very excited because it was our first
time to see &plus; touch snow .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#73:2>
<del> four-characters </del> Enclosed are two photos which I took
during the journey .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#74:2>
Do I look older than before ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#75:2>
I  ' ll be 22 in the coming birthday ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#76:2>
it is a bit old for a girl .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#77:2>
My friend said to me that we began to look different from the
teenagers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#78:2>
On the 23rd this month , I  ' ll go to Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#79:2>
This time is free of charge because it is a study tour organised by a
youth center and is sponsored by the Taiwan Gov't .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#80:2>
The Organizing Committee said that they would give us time to play
around and I hope so .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#81:2>
I don't want to spend so much money in shopping this time because
after the <del> t </del> trip to Europe , I don't have much money left in my
account .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#82:2>
I think I  ' ve to work harder because I don't want to get pocket money
from my dad or mum anymore .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#83:2>
You know , as a Uni student , we  ' ve to take care of ourselves .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#84:2>
Besides , I  ' ve to save some money to buy a suit for job interviews .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#85:2>
Nowadays , presentable suits are not cheap ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#86:2>
they always cost more <-> that </-> <+> than </+> HK&dollar;1300 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#87:2>
Last month , I  ' ve bought a pair of leather shoes and it cost me 900
H.K . dollars .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#88:2>
Oh ! What a world is it ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#89:2>
I think I  ' ve to stop here because I  ' m very sleepy and I  ' ve to
get up <del> rearly </del> early next morning because I <del>  ' ll </del> and
my friend  ' ll go to Cheung Chau <O> two-Chinese-characters-in-brackets </O>
to barbecue .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#90:2>
Good Nite ! </p> <O> a smiling face </O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#91:2>
Yours,

P.S . &ldquo; Please say Merry Christmas &plus; Happy New Year to
all your family members for me . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#95:2>
And I hope you can read my hand writing because I  ' m getting more
&plus; more sleepy in the latter part as you can see .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#96:2>
I  ' m sorry I haven't draft the letter . </p> </I>

Dear Selina ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#99:3>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#100:3>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#101:3>
Today is the beginning of the Easter Holidays .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#102:3>
Have you received any chocolate egg ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#103:3>
I haven't and I won't buy any as they will make me fat .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#104:3>
Recently , I found that I  ' m getting fatter and fatter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#105:3>
I have received the photos you sent me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#106:3>
You look quite nice .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#107:3>
Black and White are in fashion in the past few years but they are
less popular now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#108:3>
I like to wear black as it will make me look a bit thinner .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#109:3>
You and your friends look feminine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#110:3>
My friends are a bit boyish .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#111:3>
They seldom wear dresses except in school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#112:3>
<-> May </-> <+> maybe </+> it is the prevailing spirit of our
school.

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#113:3>
Now , I send you one of the photos which was taken during the
Geography field camp last month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#114:3>
The other one enclosed was taken in China during the Lunar New Year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#115:3>
I hope you  ' ll like them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#116:3>
Do you like to see movie ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#117:3>
I do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#118:3>
Yesterday , I went to see &ldquo; My Left Foot &rdquo; with my
friends .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#119:3>
It  ' s really a good film .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#120:3>
Daniel Day Lewis really gave a fine performance .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#121:3>
Have you seen this film before ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#122:3>
Which star do you like most ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#123:3>
I like Tom Cruise and Michael J . Fox .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#124:3>
My friend told me that &ldquo; Dead Poet Society &rdquo; was also a
good film , however , I haven't seen it before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#125:3>
I think I  ' ll go to see it later .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#126:3>
Well !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#127:3>
I  ' ve to stop here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#128:3>
Write more to you next time !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#129:3>
Bye ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#130:3>
Best Wishes to You!!

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#131:3>
Yours,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#132:3>
Amelia

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#133:3>
P.S. I  ' ve taken some photos with my friends in school but I
haven't <-> get </-> <+> got </+> them back yet .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#134:3>
So I  ' ll send some to you afterward .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#135:3>
Have you taken photos in your school ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#136:3>
If yes , please send me some of them . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#137:4>
I  ' m Shirley , Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#138:4>
you should not be so angry as u know I  ' m quite busy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#139:4>
u want me to be the boss ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#140:4>
Ok , when I receive the salary of <-> tution </-> <+> tuition </+>
fee , I pay u to have chicken wings , OK ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#141:4>
&obrack; u are really &ldquo; big-mouth-Yee &rdquo; , HaHa ! ! !
&cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#142:4>
Tonight , our floor will go to Sham Shui Bay with 13/F boys ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#143:4>
I will wear as much as I can since I know there will be very cold .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#144:4>
Yesterday , I meet vivian

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#145:4>
She called Shriley loudly ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#146:4>
it scared me ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#147:4>
And it seemed that all the people around knew that I  ' m Simmy-mui
and my name is shirley ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#148:4>
<-> Howcome</-> <+> How come </+> ? ? ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#149:4>
10mins later I will have test of Macro .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#150:4>
I should work hard in reading week cos I find that the time at hall
is often not controlled by myself ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#151:4>
u will understand why ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#152:4>
That  ' s all ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#153:4>
BYE </I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#154:5>
I know u are busy and have so many dates .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#155:5>
But I  ' m your sister so that I should have some sort of priority ,
right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#156:5>
That  ' s ok this time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#157:5>
But the next time we go out to have meal , u pay it , ok ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#158:5>
Just a <-> panelty </-> <+> penalty </+> for u to refuse my
invitation today ! ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#159:5>
Are u really very busy ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#160:5>
My floormates also say that they have to hand in term essays before
term break so I know u will be busy too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#161:5>
Next time send me a longer message .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#162:5>
Now I will check the a/c almost <-> everyday </-> <+> every day </+>
since I find that it is very convenient to communicate with friends like
wing-yu ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#163:5>
save more time than talking on phone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#164:5>
That  ' s all , besides I am sick today , but I think I  ' ve
already done <-> mybest </-> <+> my best </+> in the previous test in this
poor state of me . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#165:5>
Remember to pay the lunch or dinner and date me next week , ok ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#166:5>
BYE , Love from pretty Shirley &obrack; ill Shirley today ! ! !
&cbrack; </I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#167:6>
Hello , What are u doing in the Campus ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#168:6>
Why don't u go to home ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#169:6>
I know , u go to &ldquo; <indig> wet </indig> &ldquo; , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#170:6>
I know u always go out to look for fun .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#171:6>
U should be more hard-working as u are a final yr. student . ! !
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#172:6>
I don't receive any message from u in these two weeks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#173:6>
But u said u have sent one to me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#174:6>
Anyway , u should pay a lunch next time as I am such a good sister ,
who send mail to u , ask u to have lunch together , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#175:6>
Sure ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#176:6>
I will go back to hall to study .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#177:6>
I find that &ldquo; home &rdquo; is not a very suitable place for
studying esp. when there is not the important test or exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#178:6>
I will sleep at home and too many things to eat as well as too many
films to see &obrack; the cable t.v. &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#179:6>
Ok , that  ' s the end now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#180:6>
U may call me to go back home together or call me to have lunch when
u are here . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#181:6>
See U , Shirley &obrack; Your pretty sister ! ! ! &cbrack; </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#182:7>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#192:8>
Dear A.F. :

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#193:8>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#194:8>
It  ' s me , Cecilia &obrack; turtle &cbrack; from Australia !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#195:8>
First of all , &ldquo; Happy Birthday &rdquo; !

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#196:8>
Today is your Birthday , right ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-002#197:8>
See , I will remember your birthday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#198:8>
So how  ' s life now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#199:8>
Very busy ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#200:8>
But I know you will still stick with KATSO &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#201:8>
now that I am here , where most of the students are Protestants , I
really treasure the days in KATSO .

<ICE-HK:W1B-002#202:8>
The Catholic society here is not very active nor closely bonded .
