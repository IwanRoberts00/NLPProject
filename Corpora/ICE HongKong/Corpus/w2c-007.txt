LIBERAL Party members &dash; accused of exploiting the row over
the Laguna City centre for former mental patients &dash; are to visit a
training centre for the mentally handicapped in Tai Po on Sunday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#4:1>
The trip is part of the conservative party  ' s plans for winning
votes in the 1995 Legislative Council elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#5:1>
The party has been accused of dropping its support for the Laguna
City centre in an attempt to win votes .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#6:1>
Residents of the Kwun Tong housing estate have been campaigning to
stop construction of the centre . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#7:1>
About 30 party members , including chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei and
Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee , and district board members are expected to join
the visit . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#8:1>
A member of the party  ' s preparatory committee , Yau Fook-ping ,
who announced the programme yesterday , said : &ldquo; I can say visiting the
district has a direct relation to the election . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#9:1>
Mr Yau said the aim of the visit was to make closer contact with
the public so as to find out their concerns , to promote the party and to
recruit new members . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#10:1>
Kowloon West and Central and Western Districts will be the next
destinations for Liberal Party visits . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#11:1>
&ldquo; We have not even discussed it arrangements for the
election yet, &rdquo; Mr Yau said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#12:1>
He rejected the idea that Tai Po was chosen because it lacked any
dominating local group or political party , thus making it easier for the
party to make an impact . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#13:1>
But he said : &ldquo; People in Tai Po are friendlier than those
in some other districts where people are quick to respond to issues by
demonstrations . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#14:1>
However , he said every district was of equal importance and they
planned to visit them all . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#15:1>
Activities on Sunday will include a meeting with district leaders
and a visit to a school and home for the elderly .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#16:1>
A question-and-answer session will be hosted by Mr Lee on noise
pollution caused by the Kowloon-Canton Railway . </p> <O> photo and caption

<bold> Group attacks arts policy review </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#19:2>
A REVIEW expected to set the stage for government arts policy
during the next decade would leave Hongkong  ' s artistic freedom backstage ,
one group has claimed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#20:2>
One of the territory  ' s few outspoken , experimental , artistic
groups , 10-year-old Zuni Icosahedron , said the government review paper
released last week lacked critical elements , particularly concerning
artistic freedom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#21:2>
Zuni member Mr Mathias Woo Yan-wai said the review wrongly
concluded the Government had forged a social and creative environment
conducive to growth of the arts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#22:2>
&ldquo; Freedom of arts expression has been ebbing over the past
10 years , despite the fact that Hongkong seems to have more institutional
democratic elements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#23:2>
&ldquo; Many vocal artistic groups in the early 1980s gradually
faded out as a result of the Government  ' s negative attitude towards them,
&rdquo; Mr Woo said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#24:2>
He cited an experience in 1991 when the Consul-General of Belgium
asked the Government to sponsor Zuni to perform in last year  ' s Hongkong
Festival in Belgium . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#25:2>
Mr Woo claimed the Government would have been happier to send all
the Zuni members away with a one-way , first-class ticket , provided the
group disappeared from Hongkong forever . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#26:2>
He said that although this might only be a joke , the Government
insisted on excluding Zuni from the festival . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#27:2>
&ldquo; The incident showed very clearly the Government  ' s
attitude towards us .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#28:2>
Over the past 10 years Zuni has faced subtle censorship like not
being allowed to stage politically-sensitive performances at government
venues, &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#29:2>
The executive director of the Urban Council  ' s Hongkong Cultural
Centre , Mr Wayne Maddern , said applicants were allowed to hire venues if
they got a permit from the commissioner of the Television and Entertainment
Licensing Authority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#30:2>
However , Mr Woo criticised the commissioner for possessing too
much discretionary power . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#31:2>
Mr Woo said Zuni  ' s counter-proposal would suggest separating the
two municipal councils from management of the cultural venues , and they
should stay independent when considering applications . </p> </I>

<bold> Oil firms queried over rise in prices </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#34:3>
OIL companies have been accused of using increased staff costs as
an excuse to justify price rises . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#35:3>
The accusation from legislators yesterday followed last November  ' s
four per cent price increase in Liquified Petroleum Gas &obrack; LPG &cbrack;
which Shell and Mobil claimed was needed to cover increases in supply and
safety-related costs arising from new legislation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#36:3>
The firms said the costs included safety-enhancing innovations
such as providing additional crew for delivery companies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#37:3>
Shell told the Economic Services and Public Utilities panel the
additional staff costs were &dollar;4.8 million . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#38:3>
This sum amounted to more than a third of the total &dollar;13.5
million increase in operating costs claimed by the gas company as a result of
the new legislation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#39:3>
But the newly-elected convenor of the panel , Mr Steven Poon
Kwok-lim , said there had been complaints from the dealers that no subsidy
had been given to them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#40:3>
&ldquo; The dealers have complained that they had been used as a
justification for the price increase, &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#41:3>
Chief Gas Safety and Enforcement engineer for the Electrical and
Mechanical Services Department , Mr Keith Whittle , said he did not know
whether any subsidy was given to the dealers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#42:3>
&ldquo; As a Gas Standards Office , we do not get involved in the
finance side of it , we are concerned about the safety side, &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#43:3>
He said the Consumer Council only approached the Gas Standards
Office to verify whether the items were included in the gas safety
legislation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#44:3>
&ldquo; It is up to the Consumer Council to deal with price
increases and not our office, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#45:3>
United Democrats chairman Mr Martin Lee Chu-ming asked whether
the Government had checked whether Shell had recruited more gas specialists
to meet the legislative workload . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#46:3>
Mr Whittle said it had not checked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#47:3>
Legislators will ask Shell and Mobil for more details at the next
panel meeting . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#50:4>
THE Government is suppressing new businesses by allowing
government-subsidised organisations an unfair competitive edge , a coalition
of private companies claimed yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#51:4>
Representatives of the Coalition for Free Enterprise told
legislators on the Trade and Industry Panel that unfair competition was
particularly evident in the sale of advertising time and space , and even
manufacturing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#52:4>
The coalition pinpointed four government-subsidised organisations
&dash; the Trade Development Council , the Mass Transit Railway Corporation ,
the Hongkong Productivity Council and Radio Television Hongkong &dash; as
enjoying unfair competition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#53:4>
It said these organisations were offered significant discounts
for advertising , exhibitions , consulting and other services only because
their financial health was assured by the Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#54:4>
But the call from legislators and the business sector for an
overall review of the problem of unfair competition was turned down by the
Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#55:4>
Secretary for Trade and Industry Mr Brian Chau Tak-hay said :
&ldquo; We see no need and we have no plan to review the situation . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#56:4>
He said it was government policy to encourage the subvented
bodies to earn profits so they could become self-sufficient . </p> </I>

<bold> Legco gets tough on category III breaches </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#58:5>
<bold> By STELLA LEE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#59:5>
CINEMA operators who allow people under 18 in to see category III
films will soon be liable to fines of up to &dollar;50,000 &dash; five times
more than previous measures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#60:5>
Legislative Councillors from the Film Censorship &obrack;
Amendment &cbrack; Bill committee had previously agreed that the proposal to
raise the penalty be deferred until a suggested review of similar legislation
on category III videotapes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#61:5>
The Crown Prosecutor had said an immediate increase from the
present &dollar;10,000 fine , fixed in 1988 , was necessary as a stronger
deterrent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#62:5>
There had been no drop in breaches and prosecutions and the
number of category III films was increasing , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#63:5>
Although there were only about 10 prosecutions in the past four
years , prosecutions were not made until an offender had been warned more
than once . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#64:5>
Some committee members , including the Liberal Party  ' s Mrs
Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee , yesterday still supported deferring the increase
until a review was completed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#65:5>
But Deputy Secretary for Recreation and Culture , Mrs Rachel
Cartland , said it might take two years to draft and pass the amendment ,
given the back-up of legislation waiting for drafting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#66:5>
A majority of the committee members supported the increase so it
could be forwarded for second reading and be passed within this Legco session .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#67:5>
United Democrat Mr Cheung Man-kwong said the unreasonable
difference in penalties for similar offences should be rectified immediately .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#68:5>
He cited the example of a video-shop owner who faced a fine of
&dollar;200,000 plus a one-year jail sentence for renting category III
videotapes to people under 18 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#69:5>
But cinema operators protested against the proposed increase and
criticised the Government for making them take almost all the responsibility
for showing category III films to young people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#70:5>
The chairman of the Hongkong Theatres Association , Mr Kong
Cho-yee , said it was difficult for cinema staff to identify who was under 18
when hundreds of people entered the theatre within five to 10 minutes before
the film . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#71:5>
&ldquo; We do not commit the offence purposefully .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#72:5>
It is an execution problem which cannot be solved even if the penalty
is raised, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#73:5>
&ldquo; It is unfair that only us and not the young people who go
and watch category III films are fined . &rdquo; </p> </I>

MANPOWER at a government agency providing financial assistance to
tertiary students will be boosted to cope with an increasing number of
applicants due to rising college fees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#77:6>
Application procedures will also be reviewed to avoid any delays
in the issuing of payment for successful applicants in future , the Student
Financial Assistance Agency said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#78:6>
The agency was expected to announce results of this year  ' s
applications earlier this month , but the delays have caused concern among
students . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#79:6>
Those who cannot come up with money to pay tuition fees face
losing their college places .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#80:6>
Some are being forced to borrow money from friends and relatives to
pay the fees in time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#81:6>
The agency will announce today the results of the first batch of
7,000 applications , while advance payments to the 6,000 successful
applicants are expected to be available shortly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#82:6>
Results of another 7,000 applications will be ready in the first
week of next month and those of the remaining applications will be announced
as soon as the processing is finished . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#83:6>
Agency controller Alfred Wong Wai-kin said the delay for only a
&ldquo; few days &rdquo; was caused by the increase in applicants and a
shortage of staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#84:6>
The agency received 19,964 applications for the local student
finance scheme this year , an increase of 54.9 per cent over last year  ' s
12,888 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#85:6>
Mr Wong said the increase in tuition fees from &dollar;8,500 to
&dollar;12,000 a term this year led to the surge in applicants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#86:6>
&ldquo; We already have an extra 10 temporary staff and five
permanent staff this year who , however , are not enough for the workload,
&rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#87:6>
He said they had planned to hire 10 more temporary staff and five
permanent staff next April . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#88:6>
However , Mr Wong said the increase might not be enough as the
number of applicants was expected to continue to rise with the tuition fees
over the next few years , to &dollar;20,500 a term by 1997-98 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#89:6>
&ldquo; We will continually review our staffing provision and
study ways of streamlining the application procedures to make the processing
work more quickly, &rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#90:6>
&ldquo; It has always been and will continue to be , the
Government  ' s policy that no students will be unable to accept through lack
of means the offer of a place at any of the University and Polytechnic Grants
Committee-funded tertiary institutions to pursue undergraduate studies .

<bold> Publisher says June 4 changes followed advice </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#92:7>
<bold> By STELLA LEE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#93:7>
A PUBLISHER yesterday defended his decision to tone down
references to the June 4 crackdown in a history textbook , saying it was not
self-censorship . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#94:7>
Manhattan Press executive director Jeffrey Shum Hing-wa said they
were just following the Education Department  ' s advice to rewrite the
textbook . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#95:7>
Mr Shum said : &ldquo; The department had some opinions , we had
to follow .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#96:7>
But I do not view this as a kind of self-censorship . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#97:7>
The latest version of the Chinese text reads : &ldquo; Following
the economic reforms , phenomena like inflation , unbalanced development and
corruption by officials emerged in China , and these had aroused government
concern and dissatisfaction of some members of the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#98:7>
&ldquo; In May 1989 , young students protested at Beijing  ' s
Tiananmen Square .

<ICE-HK:W2C-007#99:7>
In June , the Government intervened to end the situation . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#100:7>
The phrase &ldquo; people from all walks of lives &rdquo; in the
original text has been replaced by &ldquo; some members of the public &rdquo; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#101:7>
Newly added phrases are the inflation and development problems ,
and the government concern . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#102:7>
Mr Shum said rewriting the text had delayed the publication by
more than a month and more than 10 inquiries a day had been received from
parents and schools to check if the book was ready . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#103:7>
Another publisher , Lingkee Publishing , has also changed the
reference in a footnote from &ldquo; clearing of Tiananmen Square &rdquo; to
&ldquo; Tiananmen Square events &rdquo; in a new history textbook . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#104:7>
Academics said the changes were &ldquo; damages &rdquo;
resulting from the way the Education Department had handled the incident .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#105:7>
Director of Education , Dominic Wong Shing-wah , advised
Manhattan Press to remove references to June 4 as history within the last 20
years without established assessment should not be covered in school history
textbooks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#106:7>
He later backed down and said such events should be handled with
care . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#107:7>
A history teacher Leung Hing-lok said publishers should learn to
exercise their academic autonomy appropriately . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#108:7>
Senior lecturer of Chinese University  ' s history department , Dr
Kwok Siu-tong , said legislators should push harder at the department and
Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang to admit mishandling the incident .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-007#109:7>
Dr Kwok criticised Mrs Chan , who had said the department had
not mishandled the case as there was no political motive , for trying to
protect the department . </p> </I>
