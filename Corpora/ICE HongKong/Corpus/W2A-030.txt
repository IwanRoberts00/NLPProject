<ICE-HK:W2A-030#3:1>
Fungal infection of bone by <it> Penicillium marneffei </it> is rare .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#4:1>
We report on a case of <it> Penicillium marneffei </it> infection in a
Filipino woman , which involved multiple soft-tissue abscesses and infection
of the axial skeleton .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#5:1>
Early diagnosis and treatment of this potentially reversible disease
is emphasised .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#6:1>
Such an approach is essential to prevent bony destruction from
becoming too advanced and , more importantly , to prevent any damage to the
spinal cord from occurring . </bold> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#7:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#8:1>
Osteomyelitis can be caused by bacteria as well as fungi .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#9:1>
The disease is treatable with appropriate antibiotics or antifungal
agents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#10:1>
During investigations , it is important to remember to look out for
fungal infection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#11:1>
Doing so will also a proper and accurate diagnosis to be made .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#12:1>
In this way , appropriate treatment can be commenced and potentially
serious complications can be avoided . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#13:1>
Case report </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#14:1>
A 30-year-old Filipino woman presented to the Queen Mary Hospital
&obrack; QMH &cbrack; in April 1993 with pyrexia of unknown origin and cervical
lymphadenopathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#15:1>
The patient had a history of mixed connective disease and had
attended regular follow-up at the Department of Medicine of the QMH .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#16:1>
Fever had developed 2 weeks before the hospital admission .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#17:1>
On arrival at the QMH , she was emaciated , in a toxic condition ,
and had intermittent fever without any bone pain .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#18:1>
A soft-tissue mass was felt over the forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#19:1>
Multiple firm and enlarged cervical lymph nodes were also palpable .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#20:1>
Laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count of 30.3
&times; 10 <sp> 9 </sp> / L &obrack;  normal range , 3.2-9.8 &times; 10 <sp> 9 </sp> / L &cbrack; with
93.6&percent; neutrophils , haemoglobin level of 86 g/L &obrack;  normal range ,
120-150 g/L &cbrack; , erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 133 mm/h &obrack;  normal range ,
0-30 mm/h &cbrack; , and C-reactive protein level of 180 mg/L &obrack;  normal range ,
100-270 mg/L &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#21:1>
Blood culture was negative for bacteria and fungi .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#22:1>
All tests to detect viruses , including human immunodeficiency virus
types 1 and 2 , gave negative results .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#23:1>
Antinuclear factor was present , at a titre of 1:1080; rheumatoid
factor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were absent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#24:1>
Biopsy examination of the bone marrow did not show any haematological
diseases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#25:1>
The X-ray of the cervical spine showed lytic lesions at the C2
vertebral body &obrack;  Fig 1 &cbrack; and the head of left humerus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#26:1>
Multiple lytic lesions were also visible over the proximal shaft of
the right femur .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#27:1>
Gallium bone scanning detected multiple sites of abnormal uptake in
the upper cervical spine , left shoulder , right side of manubrium , and
right femur , which corresponded to multiple sites of infection .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#28:1>
The chest X-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary infection . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#29:1>
An excisional biopsy examination of a cervical lymph node showed
granulomatous lymphadenitis , but this finding was inconclusive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#30:1>
The biopsy site failed to heal and persisted as a skin ulcer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#31:1>
Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#32:1>
The patient was given antituberculous drug treatment empirically .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#33:1>
Fine-needle aspiration of the soft-tissue mass on the left side of
the forehead revealed yeast cells .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#34:1>
Histo-logical examination of decalcified sections of a core biopsy
sample from the left humerus showed diffuse fibrosis of the intertrabecular
space and infiltration of histocytes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#35:1>
Well-formed granulomas or giant cells were absent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#36:1>
However , yeast-form fungi of 5 to 6 &mu;m in diameter were detected
after special staining tests had been performed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#37:1>
These findings were consistent with tissue infection with <it>
Penicillium </it> species . </p> <O> Two figures </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#38:1>
The bony trabeculae were unremarkable and there was no evidence
of lymphomatous infiltration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#39:1>
Micro-biological examination revealed dimorphic fungus , and fungal
culture was positive for <it> Penicillium marneffei </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#40:1>
The culture of the fine-needle aspirate from the fore-head mass was
also positive for <it> P marneffei </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#41:1>
The pa-tient developed a left-arm abscess in the subcutaneous plane ,
which extended up to the axilla about 1 week after core biopsy of the left
humerus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#42:1>
Fifty millilitres of pus was drained; its culture confirmed infection
with <it> P marneffei </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#43:1>
Further abscesses developed despite the commence-ment of
antifungal treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#44:1>
The patient was given intravenous amphotericin B and fluconazole .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#45:1>
A retro-pharyngeal abscess presented itself with acute stridor and
dyspnoea several days later .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#46:1>
Another abscess developed at the lateral aspect of the right thigh ,
with underlying osteomyelitis of the femur &obrack;  Fig 2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#47:1>
Both conditions were treated by performing surgical debridement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#48:1>
The involvement of the C2 vertebral body was treated with antifungal
medication .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#49:1>
There was no neurological deficit or progression of the bony erosions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#50:1>
The fever then subsided , and the results of blood investigations
such as white blood cell count and measure-ment of the erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level gradually returned to normal
over 3 to 4 weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#51:1>
The patient  ' s general condition improved , and she was able to walk
with support .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#52:1>
She later returned to the Philippines while continuing antifungal
therapy . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#53:1>
Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#54:1>
Human infection with <it> P marneffei </it> was first documented
in 1956 by Capponi. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#55:1>
That case involved the accidental inoculation of the fungus into a
laboratory investigator , and the infection subsided with antifungal drug
treat-ment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#56:1>
The organism has been isolated from the liver of bamboo rates from
Vietnam. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#57:1>
Other case reports showed that the patients with <it> P marneffei
</it> infection either lived in South-East Asia or had a history of
travelling to this region. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#58:1>
Clinical infection with the organism has been reported in
immunocompromised patients as well as in healthy individuals. <sp> 4 </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#59:1>
The combination of fever , lymphadenopathy , and the development
of abscesses are common manifestations of infection with <it> P marneffei
</it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#60:1>
The lymphadenopathy may ulcerate and cause mediastinal compression -
a situation that may often mimic tuberculosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#61:1>
Lymph node biopsy is usually not helpful in distinguishing between
the two diagnoses. <sp> 5 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#62:1>
Without appropriate treat-ment , the infection may become
disseminated to the lung and liver .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#63:1>
Eventually , the infection may be fatal. <sp> 2,6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#64:1>
The clinician should bear this differential diagnosis in mind when
such clinical features are encountered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#65:1>
Most of the previously reported cases showed involvement mainly in
soft tissues and abdominal organs. <sp> 2,6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#66:1>
Chan and Woo <sp> 3 </sp> reported on a patient with mainly
peripheral skeletal involvement , which was manifested by multiple joint pain
, swelling , and multiple radiolucent areas at the ends of various long bones
and phalanges .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#67:1>
Jayanetra et al <sp> 6 </sp> described involvement of the long bones
, skull , and ribs in two patients of their series .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#68:1>
Louthrenoo et al <sp> 7 </sp> reported that one of eight patients
showed major involvement of the axial skeleton . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#69:1>
In the patient in this report , the <it> P marneffei </it>
infec-tion progressed rapidly with bony destruction , soon after the onset of
disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#70:1>
When the spine is involved , this rapid progression can be
potentially serious , result in severe neurological deficit , and eventually
be fatal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#71:1>
Early treatment is very important to prevent any irreversible damage
to the spinal cord .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#72:1>
Despite giving full-dose antifungal treatment to this patient , more
soft-tissue abscesses developed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#73:1>
These symptoms probably reflect a slow onset of the effect of
anti-fungal agents .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#74:1>
This delay further emphasises need for early treatment . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#75:1>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#76:1>
<it> Penicillium marneffei </it> infection in bone is rare .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#77:1>
When it occurs , systemic upset can be severe .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#78:1>
There are multi-focal bony lytic lesions , which can be rapidly
progressive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#79:1>
Both the axial and peripheral skeleton can be involved , and the soft
tissues are usually also affected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#80:1>
Recent contact in South-East Asia should raise suspicion of
infection with <it> P marneffei </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#81:1>
Early treatment is essential so that the bony destruction does not
become too advanced and , more importantly , to prevent any damage to the
spinal core from occurring . </p>

<p> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#84:2>
A case of acute thallium poisoning in a 67-year-old Chinese woman is
described .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#85:2>
She presented with acute pain in the chest , abdomen , and lower
limbs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#86:2>
The diagnosis was not made , however , until alopecia developed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#87:2>
Detoxification treatment , which included Prussian blue &obrack;  potassium
ferric hexacyanoferrate &cbrack; was given , but further neurological damage occurred .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#88:2>
The patient  ' s motor function recovered after 1 year , but residual
sensory neuropathy remained .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#89:2>
This case illustrated that tissue-bound thallium may cause prolonged
neurological damage if detoxification therapy is not commenced within 7 hours
of the onset of acute poisoning .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#90:2>
Acute abdominal pain and painful neuropathy in the lower extremities
are important early diagnostic clues for timely therapy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#91:2>
However , by the time alopecia develops - typically around 2 weeks
after the onset of symptoms - detoxification therapy may not be able to
prevent the development of prolonged neurological damage . </bold> </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#92:2>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#93:2>
Thallium is a heavy metal that is used in the manufacture of
electronics , alloys , and glass .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#94:2>
In clinical practice , thallium 201 is used as a radioactive tracer
in heart scintigraphy to detect myocardial ischaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#95:2>
Thallium and its salt are highly toxic , however , and industrial
safety guidelines exist in the workplace .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#96:2>
Accidental poisoning has become rare in the domestic setting since
the 1970s , when thallium-based rodenticides were banned in many countries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#97:2>
The majority of reported cases of thallium poisoning in the past two
decades have been caused by deliberate poisoning. <sp> 1-5 </sp> </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#98:2>
Case report </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#99:2>
A 67-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to a country hospital in
San Jose , California , United States , in September 1997 because if acute
pain in the chest , abdomen , and lower limbs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#100:2>
The pain in the lower limbs was described as burning and severe .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#101:2>
There was no vomiting or diarrhoea .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#102:2>
The patient was discharged after 3 days , but the cause of her
illness was undetermined . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#103:2>
The patient presented to the author  ' s private clinic 1 week
later because of persistent symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#104:2>
Physical examination of the patient showed mild tenderness over the
abdomen , and electrocardiography showed non-specific T-ware inversion in the
anterior leads .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#105:2>
Routine urinalysis gave normal results , and laboratory tests showed
normal blood cell counts , blood glucose level , and kidney and liver
function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#106:2>
The patient was treated symptomatically with analgesics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#107:2>
She was soon readmitted to hospital , however , because of
prostration and fainting spells , as well as persistent symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#108:2>
The patient suspected that she was being poisoned .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#109:2>
Paranoid psychosis and trichotillomania were diagnosed , and she was
admitted under restraint to the psychiatric department for observation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#110:2>
After being discharged home , at week 5 , she returned to the
author  ' s private clinic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#111:2>
According to the patient , the pain had become less severe .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#112:2>
Physical examination showed diffuse alopecia , which had started 2
weeks after the onset of the initial symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#113:2>
Thallium poisoning was suspected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#114:2>
A urine sample was taken to measure its thallium content by
graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#115:2>
The urine level of thallium was 8.56 &mu;mol/L &obrack;  normal level ,
<0.003 &mu;mol/L; a level of  &greater-than; 0.98 &mu;mol/L is toxic &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#116:2>
The case was reported to the police; the prime suspect was the
patient  ' s 73-year-old cohabitant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#117:2>
A dose of activated charcoal was given in the emergency
department of a nearby district hospital , and the patient was discharged
home with a 2-week supply of succimer &obrack;  2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#118:2>
At follow-up at week 6 , however , it was found that the pain in her
chest , abdomen , and lower limbs had subsided , but symptoms of peripheral
neuropathy had emerged - namely , bilateral numbness and loss of
exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensations in the toes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#119:2>
She had mild weakness in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs ,
as indicated by the patient  ' s difficulty in rising from the squatting
position .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#120:2>
She also complained of right-sided headache and tachy-cardia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#121:2>
She was immediately admitted to the Stanford University Medical
Center for treatment with oral Prussians blue &obrack;  potassium ferric
hexacyanoferrate , KFe <sb> &obrack;  III &cbrack; </sb> &obrack;  Fe <sb> &obrack;  II &cbrack; </sb> &obrack;  CN &cbrack; <sb> 6
</sb>  &cbrack;  &cbrack; 4 g every 8 hours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#122:2>
The blood thallium level at the time of hospitalisation was 0.15
µmol/L; &greater-than; 0.49 &mu;mol/L is toxic &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#123:2>
No other heavy metals were present .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#124:2>
The patient tolerated Prussian blue very well , buy hypoaesthesia
developed over the medical aspect of her left calf on the second day of
treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#125:2>
She was discharged home 1 week later , when the urine level of
thallium was 0.14 &mu;mol/L . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#126:2>
In week 9 , the patient experienced neurological deterioration ,
impairment of short-term memory , double incontinence , tremor , ataxia , and
falls .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#127:2>
Physical examination showed hypoaesthesia of the right trigeminal
nerve , general weakness of the extremities &obrack;  grade 4/5 &cbrack; , cerebellar ataxia , tremor , and dyskinesis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#128:2>
Planter reflexes were normal , and the urine thallium level was 0.33
µmol/L .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#129:2>
By week 14 , the right facial numbness fully recovered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#130:2>
By week 20 , there was recovery of sphincter control and regrowth of
hair .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#131:2>
Urine thallium was undetectable 2 weeks later .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#132:2>
The weakness in the lower limbs , unsteady gait , falls , and
bruises persisted until August 1998 , when her condition noticeably improved
, although residual weakness remained . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#133:2>
Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#134:2>
Thallium salts are colourless , tasteless , and odourless .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#135:2>
They are readily absorbed , and thallium becomes distributed
throughout the intravascular compartment within 4 hours .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#136:2>
Redistribution between the extracellular and intracellular
compartments is complete within 24 hours .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#137:2>
Forty percent of the absorbed poison is excreted by the kidney;
60&percent; is excreted in the faeces , but its presence in the body is
prolonged by the entero-hepatic circulation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#138:2>
The elimination half-life can be as long as 30 days .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#139:2>
A dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg is lethal. <sp> 5 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#140:2>
Within the cells , thallium displaces potassium in the Na-K
ATPase channel , which is responsible for generating ionic gradients in nerve
, heart , and muscle cells .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#141:2>
Thallium also bins to sulphydryl groups , which act against free
radicals , and with riboflavin , which mediates hydrogen transfer in tissue
respiratory systems and provides energy to maintain axon integrity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#142:2>
The clinical manifestations of thallium poisoning depend on the
dosage , chronicity , body weight , individual susceptibility , and the onset
of treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#143:2>
Early aggressive therapy with Prussian blue , forced diuresis , and
haemodialysis may not only be life-saving , but also reduce the duration and
extent of neurological damage if they are given within 72 hours , as has been
illustrated in five reported cases. <sp> 1,2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#144:2>
Despite the fact that the peak serum level of thallium exceeded 24
&mu;mol/L in one case , neurological recovery was complete within 1 month in all
five cases . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#145:2>
In contrast , in a case in which treatment was delayed for 5
days after the onset of symptoms , the neurological damage lasted for more
than 9 months. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#146:2>
Other case reports have shown that more prolonged and possibly
permanent neurological complications can occur when treatment is delayed
until after the onset of alopecia. <sp> 4,5 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#147:2>
An extended electrophysiological study of a case of thallium
poisoning has shown that distal axonopathies of the lower extremities may
take more than 2 years to recover. <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#148:2>
Neurological deficit lasting more than 30 years has also been
reported. <sp> 7 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#149:2>
In this case , treatment with Prussian blue in the 7th week of
illness did not prevent the progression of neurological damage , although the
thallium level had decreased to a non-toxic level after treatment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#150:2>
A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose thallium
poisoning at an early stage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#151:2>
Important clues are acute abdominal symptoms and painful neuropathy
in the extremities occurring within 72 hours of the onset of initial symptoms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#152:2>
Differential diagnoses include botulism , ciguatera poisoning ,
porphyria , Guillaine-Barr&eacute; syndrome , and poisoning with other heavy metals .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-030#153:2>
Thallium may be detected in the urine 1 hour after thallium
ingestion , but most clinical laboratories may not have the available
facilities to quantitatively analyse the thallium content .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#154:2>
A rapid quantitative urine test can be done by mixing urine with
0.4&percent; sodium bismuth in 20&percent; nitric acid and 10&percent; sodium
iodide .

<ICE-HK:W2A-030#155:2>
A red precipitate indicates thallium is present . <sp> 8 </sp> </p>
