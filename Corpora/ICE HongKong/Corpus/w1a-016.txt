4.
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#2:1>
Starch is made up of glucose subunit linked together by a
<unc> symbol </unc> glycosidic linkage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#3:1>
Of the five hydroxyl group on the glucose molecules , only 2 of them
are involved in the formation of glycosidic linkage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#4:1>
The other 3 hydroxyl group on the glucose subunit of starch molecules
have got the tendency to interacting with each other by forming hydrogen
bonding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#5:1>
Therefore , starch molecule in solution may either precipitate out or
forming a gel when allowing it to stand at gravity for some time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#6:1>
If the conc. of starch is high enough and the temp. is low , a gel
made up of starch molecules will be formed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#7:1>
On the other hand , if the conc. of starch is low and the temp. is not
low enough , the starch molecules will be precipitated out .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#8:1>
Such tendency for starch molecules to interact together when in
aqueous solution is defined as retrogradation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#9:1>
General retrogradation are more likely to happen in amylose than in
amylopectin molecules because the side branch of amylopectin molecules deter
its interaction .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#10:1>
Such phenomenon is used to explain many storage properties of
starch-based food .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#11:1>
For example , the staling of bread can be explained partly by
retrogradation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#12:1>
During baking , the starch granules swell and the linear amylose
molecules will leak out and interact with the water molecules to form a
consistent gel .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#13:1>
When the bread is being stored for some time , the bread will become
harder in texture and unpalatable .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#14:1>
This is called staling of bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#15:1>
It is mainly the retrogradation of amylopectin molecules that result
in such phenomenon .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#16:1>
The amylopectin molecules in the starch granule will not be leaked
out from the granule when the dough is heated in fresh bread , the
amylopectin will exist in a dilated state that is mainly contribute the bread
freshness .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#17:1>
After storing for some time , the amylopectin molecules will then
under go some form of retrogradation and that will result in the formation of
a rather rigid structures in the bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#18:1>
Another example of retrogradation may found in jellies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#19:1>
The fresh jellies will form a translucent and soft gel .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#20:1>
When it is undergo several freeze-thaw cycle , the gel will become
opaque , hard and watery .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#21:1>
It is due to the fact that starch molecule will have the ability to
move as a result of free water formed in thawing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#22:1>
Such interaction will prevent the <-> reformiation </-> <+>
reformation </+> of the gel structure when the gel structure is being freeze
again . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#23:1>
&obrack; a &cbrack; The behaviour of starch in aqueous &obrack;
mainly in dilute aqueous solution &cbrack; solution can be studied by
performing a viscosity analysis and the resulting graph showing the change of
viscosity with time and temp. is called viscoamylograph .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#24:1>
However , in most food system , the aqueous starch solution is very
concentrated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#25:1>
So the result from viscoamylograph may not correctly reflect the
actual situation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#26:1>
During the experiment , the starch solution is being stirred with a
certain shear rate and the temperature of the solution is being altered in a
programmed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#27:1>
The following figure is a stylized result of such experiment : <O>
graph </O> </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#28:1>
When the starch solution is being heated and stirred at below its
gelatinization temp. , the viscosity of the solution doesn't increase at all .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#29:1>
After the gelatinization occur &obrack; i.e. loss of birefringence
&cbrack; , the viscosity increase because of the taking up of water by the
swelling starch <-> graules </-> <+> granules </+> and the release of amylose
molecules to the surrounding water .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#30:1>
The extent of starch solubulization increase with the increase in
temp .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#31:1>
The temp. is raised to 95&degree;C and it is not intended to increase
further because water will be boiled at higher temp .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#32:1>
Complete solubulization of starch will not occur at temp. smaller
than 120&degree;C and so complete solubilization of starch never occur in any
food system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#33:1>
This stage of increasing viscosity with temp. &obrack; i.e. a-b in
the graph &cbrack; is called pasting because a paste of starch solution is
being formed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#34:1>
The starch solution is the hold at 95&degree;C for 1 hour and the
viscosity start to decrease .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#35:1>
It is due to the fact of shear thinning i.e. the orientation of the
starch molecule in the same direction to the starch solution is being stirred .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#36:1>
After time C , the starch solution is cooled down slowly and the
viscosity is increased again .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#37:1>
It is because as the temp. is being lowered , the energy in the
system will be lowered and there is a higher tendency for hydrogen bond
formation which contribute to the increase in viscosity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#38:1>
This is called set back stage . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#39:1>
Although , viscoamylographic technique can only determine the
starch in dilute solution , the understanding of which is also important for
investigating the properties of starch in concentrated food system . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#40:1>
3. The utilization of corn can be roughly divided into two
categories i.e. the utilization of the primary products and the secondary
products of corn processing . &obrack; dry and wet milling &cbrack; </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#41:1>
The primary products for corn processing is starch .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#42:1>
Starch can be diverted into industrial use or food .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#43:1>
For industrial purpose , starch is mainly used for the production of
paper or cohesives .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#44:1>
For food uses , the starch molecules can be modified by a variety of
processes &obrack; e.g. cross linking , acid thinning , substitution &cbrack;
so that the physical properties of the starch molecules can be adjusted for
different purposes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#45:1>
Mostly the starch is being used as an <-> thicknening </-> <+>
thickening </+> or bulking agent in food so as to give foods a good mouthful .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#46:1>
For example , chicken used for deep frying are usually coated with a
layer of starch to give a thickened properties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#47:1>
On the other hand , starch from corn can be utilized for the
formation of sweeteners .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#48:1>
The process usually involving acid , acid/enzyme or enzymes process
to convert starch molecules to sweeteners .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#49:1>
In most cases , enzymes &obrack; pullulanase glucoamylase , &alpha;
and &beta; amylase , isomerase &cbrack; are used in preference to acid for
hydrolyzing starch molecules because the acid catalyzed reaction is not
specific and many sided reaction may occur that result in the formation of
undesirable odour and flavour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#50:1>
The major sweeteners made from corn starch are : dextrose ,
maltodextrin , high fructose corn syrup , regular corn syrup .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#51:1>
Their difference can be stated by the term called dextrose equivalent .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#52:1>
This term represent the relative reducing power of a carbohydrate to
pure dextrose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#53:1>
Since starch molecules contain only one reducing group , it has a DE
of O .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#54:1>
As the degree o hydrolysis is being increased , the reduced power and
hence DE will be increased .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#55:1>
Dextrose is actually glucose and have a DE of &greater-than; 99.4 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#56:1>
Maltodextrin has the DE &less-than; 20 while corn syrup has DE
between 20-99.4 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#57:1>
High fructose corn syrup is being a special kind of syrup and is not
defined under the DE system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#58:1>
The dextrose and corn syrup has a high osmotic potential and are
sweet so they are being used in a variety of food system , e.g. bakery ,
confectionery , ice cream , biscuits , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#59:1>
The maltodextrin is not sweet and since it has got a high molecular
weight , &obrack; <symbol> because </symbol> of low degree of hydrolysis
&cbrack; , it is used mainly as an bulking and thickening agent in food
similar to pure starch .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#60:1>
High fructose corn syrup is a special kind of syrup that contain
about 55&percent; of fructose that is formed by conversion of glucose to
fructose by isomerase .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#61:1>
It is 1.8 times sweeter than sucrose and 2.4 times sweeter than
glucose .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#62:1>
Also , its sweetness is increased at lower temp .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#63:1>
Therefore , its major use is in replacing sucrose in soft drinks .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#64:1>
The secondary products from corn wet and dry milling process
including the protein , corn steep liquor &obrack; condensed fermented corn
extractives &cbrack; , the bran &obrack; fibrous materials from the corn
&cbrack; and corn germ .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#65:1>
Most of the usage of these by products is converted to animal feed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#66:1>
For example , corn gluten meal is mainly the protein from corn that
is highly digestable and contain rich amount of carotene and xanthophyll and
so is a good feed to poultry animals .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#67:1>
However protein contain high amount of sulphur containing amino acid
and low amount of essential amino acid lysine tryptophan .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#68:1>
So feed high amt. of corn protein to animal may lead to a.a.
deficiency .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#69:1>
Soy bean protein contain high amt of essential a.a. and low amount of
sulphur containing amino acid and so is a good supplement to corn gluten meal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#70:1>
Another feed is called corn gluten feed that is actually a mixture of
bran , corn germ and corn steep liquor .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#71:1>
It is similar to corn gluten meal except that it contain lower amount
of protein .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#72:1>
The corn germ is another useful byproducts because it can be used to
extract the oil content and the corn oil made has got a good consume image .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#73:1>
It is because corn oil contain large amount of poly-unsaturated fatty
acid that is beneficial to health .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#74:1>
Also , the corn oil do not form wax under refrigeration and has
higher oxidative stability . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#75:1>
Apart from the above two categories , the corn can also be used
as a substrate for fermentation to produce industrial ethyl alcohol and
alcoholic beverages .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#76:1>
In such process , whole corn is grounded and slurried , heated to
gelatinize the starch and then saccharified by the enzymes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#77:1>
The simple sugar formed is then fermented by yeast to form alcohol .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#78:1>
The fermented mash and the water <-> solubes </-> <+> <?> solubles
</?> </+> can be isolated out and form distiller feed for animals . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#79:1>
Finally , the residues of corn i.e. corn cob and corn stalk can
also be used when it is being bioconverted to useful form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#80:1>
For example , they can be used to produce furfural .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#81:1>
Recently , <?> scientists </?> are investigating the potential of
such corn residues to other energy rich biomolecules for production of energy .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#82:1>
I think that China can increase the value of domestic maize
production by developing or even creating the market for the corn byproduct
such as corn oil , animal feed or sweeteners .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#83:1>
It may be successful because a considerable part of the corn is being
the byproducts and there are a huge variety of utilization of corn products .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#84:1>
This method is justified when considering the situation in USA where
a huge amount of corn byproducts are produced each year and quite a large
portion of income of the corn processing industry is derived from corn
byproducts . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#85:1>
1. The wheat storage protein are mainly gluten protein which
consist of two types: glutenin and gliadin .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#86:1>
They are important in breadmaking quality because: &obrack; 1
&cbrack; Protein are essential nutrients to human and the biological value of
protein to human depends on its amino acid variety because human cannot
synthesize certain kind of amino acid and that must be absorbed from food
i.e. essential amino acid .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#87:1>
Unfortunately the storage protein of wheat contain low amount of
essential amino acid and so enrichment of bread with essential a.a. seems
desirable to those people that bread are their major food .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#88:1>
&obrack; 2 &cbrack; It is the storage protein of the wheat that can
form a viscoelastic dough during mixing with water .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#89:1>
Such viscoelastic dough has got the ability to form air cell that
gives bread it s typical porous structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#90:1>
Moreover , the air cell has got the ability to retain CO2 formed
during fermentation and N2 entrapped during mixing of dough , so the bread
can have its light and leavened structure after baking which is the most
important eating quality of bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#91:1>
The <?> gliadin </?> protein of wheat is single chained and it gives
the dough the cohesive properties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#92:1>
The glutenin protein is multichained and give the dough the ability
to resist extension .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#93:1>
Without storage protein of wheat , such viscoelastic dough cannot be
formed and so wheat flour cannot be used to make bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#94:1>
The reason that the storage protein of wheat can form a dough is not
exactly known .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#95:1>
However , it may be partly explained by the fact that the protein
contain low charge density and so the tendency of protein to <-> repell </->
<+> repel </+> each other is low .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#96:1>
Also most of the amino acid in the protein are glutamic acid and <?>
praline </?> and the glutamic acid is mainly existed in its amide form .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#97:1>
So large extent of hydrogen bond may form that may probably assist in
the formation of dough . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#98:1>
As illustrated from above , it can be seen that the quality of
storage protein in wheat can significantly affect the texture and hence
quality of the bread .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#99:1>
For example if the protein is not strong enough , it will be
denatured very quickly during the baking stage before the starch is
completely gelatinized .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#100:1>
It is detrimental because the final structure of the bread is formed
as a result of starch gelatinization and formation of starch gel after
cooling , so if the structure of the dough &obrack; i.e. the protein matrix
&cbrack; is destroyed before the starch gel is formed , the final structure
of the bread will be collapsed .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#101:1>
To a less severe extent , if the structure of dough formed by the
protein matrix is not firm enough , the small gas cells will be easily
collapsed to form a large air cells during baking .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#102:1>
The resulting bread will contain coarse cell structures and that is
of poor quality . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-016#103:1>
On the other hand , if the protein cannot be hydrated easily ,
it will increase the time for mixing to form a viscous dough .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#104:1>
Mixing is actually the complete hydration of the starch and protein
molecules in the flour .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#105:1>
After hydration , the protein molecules will form a complex , 3
dimension matrix with starch molecules dispersed on it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#106:1>
Therefore , if the protein molecules cannot be hydrated easily , the
dough will be very difficult to form and mixing time will be extended .

<ICE-HK:W1A-016#107:1>
In conclusion , the quality of storage protein is important in bread
quality during the whole process of breadmaking i.e. doughmixing fermentation
and baking . </p> </I>
