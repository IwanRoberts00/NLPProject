<h> <bold> A FOREIGN SPA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#2:1>
Connie Tsang </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#3:1>
The white cotton robe keeps rubbing my chest as I walk down the
corridor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#4:1>
The package instruction says the robe was designed according to the
old queen  ' s kimono .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#5:1>
Her nipples must have been anti-itch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#6:1>
Mine is now itching terribly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#7:1>
When I am about to scratch , the chambermaids walk pass , carrying
piles of dirty bed sheets .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#8:1>
Their eyes stare right at my nipples , as if they have never seen a
blond. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#9:1>
Mom claims it is the best hotel in town .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#10:1>
It looks like a cultural museum .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#11:1>
Different creepy noises sound as you walk on the polished wood floor .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#12:1>
Carved wooden pillars stand as guards; the wild , sharp eyes of the
dragons and other creatures stare at you , from all angles .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#13:1>
My body trembles </p> .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#14:1>
Mom put me in this hotel because I have never dared to take a
bath , not mention going to a spa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#15:1>
Having been in this country for so long , mom says I should at least
try to conform to the life style .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#16:1>
Not that I am scared of water , although I was once drowned in a
river , in the arms of a priest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#17:1>
But taking a bath is an absurd idea .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#18:1>
Staying in a hot tub until your skin creases and wrinkles , wiping
the sweat away and feeling suffocated is not the aim of a bath .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#19:1>
Soaking in the water with a bunch of strangers seems almost like
going to a pool where kids pee into the water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#20:1>
It is not cleaning up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#21:1>
But I decide to try the spa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#22:1>
The lift doors open into the basement .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#23:1>
When I step out , I almost fall into the boiling water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#24:1>
There is no path , no steps .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#25:1>
The moment you walk out of the lift , you are in the spa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#26:1>
Is this an adventure ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#27:1>
Don't they allow their clients to consider before they fall into the
spa ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#28:1>
All those blackhead ladies behind me undress right away and jump into
the spa .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#29:1>
Murmuring , the blackheads look back as I press hard on the open
button .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#30:1>
I hesitate and wait .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#31:1>
I decide to go back to my room .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#32:1>
I try to release the button .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#33:1>
My finger will not obey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#34:1>
I ask my finger to release .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#35:1>
Again and again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#36:1>
It will not listen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#37:1>
The lift beeps to hurry me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#38:1>
I look at the nude blackheads down in the spa as they examine me from
head to toe and then stare at my nipples .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#39:1>
When I finally convince my finger to release the open button again. ,
the door does not close .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#40:1>
I press on the close button a couple of times .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#41:1>
The door does not shut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#42:1>
It is like a trip to hell and I am left with no way out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#43:1>
The eyes of the blackheads fix on my nipples .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#44:1>
What am I supposed to do ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#45:1>
Undress or stay ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#46:1>
I retreat to the corner of the lift where I can hide , and wait for
rescue .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#47:1>
Come on , management ! And could you shut up , computer voice ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#48:1>
The lift beeps again and attracts more attention .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#49:1>
Those nosey nude heads gather closer to the lift .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#50:1>
I have to make a decision .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#51:1>
Untie and jump !

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#52:1>
No , it  ' s better to wait. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#53:1>
The steam blends with the cold air in the lift warming up my body
as well as my contact lenses .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#54:1>
Tears burst out and blur my sight .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#55:1>
For a second , there is no more talking , twittering , and murmurs
but only echoes of the water droplets splashing on the poolside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#56:1>
All the blackheads sink into the boiling water .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#57:1>
Their hands wave at my direction as if welcoming a king .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#58:1>
They greet and encourage a coward .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#59:1>
They swim towards the lift , creating a path .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#60:1>
I see their backs with dragon and phoenix tattoos lying in front of
me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#61:1>
I carefully step out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#62:1>
On the first back , the second , and third , beginning my first
journey to the cozy family in a foreign land. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#64:2>
<bold> FULL FATHOM FIVE THY FATHER LIES: The King &obrack;  1885-1944 &cbrack;
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#65:2>
<bold> M </bold> y father-in-law was called  ' King ' by his wives .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#66:2>
They used the English word without the article , but with the
Cantonese premodifer - hence  ' Ah King ' .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#67:2>
The wives didn't know any English , so he must have taught them the
English word .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#68:2>
Most of the denizens of his smaller domestic world were not at all
sure of how he made his money , although the ones who claimed to be his  ' most
intimate ' concubine could rattle off the names of his various enterprises .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#69:2>
Suffice it to say , his wife , concubines , younger offspring and
legions of servants were in great awe of his money and particularly of his
power in the world they hardly knew .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#70:2>
I never met him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#71:2>
I married his son some twenty years after the boat he was travelling
on to Macau was bombed towards the end of the Second World War .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#72:2>
I think that perhaps the King did much to foster the mystique
surrounding his person at home among his multitudinous subjects , most of
whom were semi-literate .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#73:2>
It is difficult to disentangle fact from fiction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#74:2>
'Ah King not only spoke English like a <it> <indig> fan-gui-lo
</indig> </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#75:2>
He spoke French and many other languages .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#76:2>
He used to talk to the French Consul all the time - chatting away.'
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#77:2>
'He also spoke <it> <indig> lau sung wah </indig> </it> &obrack;  " the
language of the older brothers" , slang for Mandarin &cbrack; like a <it> <indig>
lausung </indig> </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#78:2>
'He was on many diplomatic missions because he was a great
negotiator. ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#79:2>
'These - and similar bits of information - were delivered by the
still adoring surviving concubines .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#80:2>
There was no doubt the King did speak English , but to what level of
proficiency , I shall never know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#81:2>
He was probably fluent because he started off as the <it> <indig>
compradore </indig> </it> or Chinese agent of a great British corporation
with offices all over the Chinese Mainland and in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#82:2>
I shall never find out if he was a prattling polyglot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#83:2>
Not only are paeans sung to his ability , but also to his good
looks:  ' He was so handsome in town they called him &ldquo; Hong Kong <it>
<indig> lang </indig> </it> &obrack;  Hong Kong good-looking  &cbrack; " .  ' 

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#84:2>
I have only seen his photographs .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#85:2>
The photo which shows him at his youngest is one of him giving away
his second daughter when he must have been in his forties: a small natty man
, with long angular face and well-defined features , he had fairly deep-set
eyes and a straight nose , and a generous mouth which in the photograph was
set in a rather stern line .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#86:2>
Was he indeed known as  ' Hong Kong good-looking ' ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#87:2>
That is something else I shall never know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#88:2>
In a later photograph , the dark hair had turned grey and sparse; the
narrow face had grown narrower still .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#89:2>
He wore spectacles like the Last Emperor , Puyi  ' s or Georgio
Armani's .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#90:2>
Puyi wore them and Georgio Armani designs them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#91:2>
I was told that these spectacles were more often twirled around with
his hand than resting on his nose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#92:2>
A photograph of Lee Pak Hung a.k.a .'the King ' hangs in our
pantry , beside one of his first wife , his  ' original match ' .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#93:2>
The pictures are black and white - or were .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#94:2>
They are now a yellowish grey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#95:2>
He looks quite distinguished , sharp eyes peering out from behind the
Puyi-Armani spectacles .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#96:2>
He is wearing a pale-coloured linen suit with narrow shoulders .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#97:2>
His photo hangs beside that of his  ' big ' wife because my  ' real'
mother-in-law , the fourth concubine of the King , had given me instructions
to always allow the lawful-wedded couple to hang side by side .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#98:2>
'Big ' Mother-in-law looks younger than her husband in the photograph
, but not particularly attractive , with an angular face and severe
centrally-parted hairstyle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#99:2>
So the pictures hang there , over thermos bottles and jars of
Metamusil , boxes of Panadol , half-full containers of vitamin pills and
tonics and elixirs , Chinese as well as Western .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#100:2>
Certainly a comedown for the King and his consort. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#101:2>
Lee Pak Hung was born in 1885 , during the last decades of the
Qing dynasty to a wealthy family in Nanhai .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#102:2>
By the time of his birth , his family had already been wealthy for
two generations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#103:2>
The founder of the family fortune was Lee Kai Ming , born in 1823 .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#104:2>
Lee Kai Ming came from a farming family and made his fortune in Siam
, as Thailand was then called .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#105:2>
Lee Kai Ming , grandfather of the King , was known by his
contemporaries and descendants by the sobriquet ,  ' Strange-eyed Three ' , and
I have seen a photograph of him , given to me by one of my sisters-in-law .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#106:2>
He was called  ' Strange-eyed Three ' because he was the third child in
the family and - more significantly - he had the strange power of being able
to see the smallest objects .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#107:2>
His eyes were like a pair of microscopes and telescopes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#108:2>
This would be hard to believe except that he had left behind proof
of his unusual abilities .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#109:2>
He copied the whole of Confucius  ' s <it> Analects </it> on to a
small round fan and the Tang poem ,  ' The Song of the <indig> Pipa </indig>
Girl ' on to a grain of rice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#110:2>
I have seen these family treasures .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#111:2>
An attempt to sell the fan recently through Christie  ' s came to an
ignominious conclusion when it was declared  ' a mere curiosity ' by the
resident expert. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#112:2>
Fortunately , the King  ' s  ' strange-eyed ' grandfather had other
talents .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#113:2>
In a year of famine in his native Nanhai , Lee Kai Ming made his way
to Annam , the Chinese name for present-day central Vietnam , by boat en
route to Bangkok .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#114:2>
A storm in the South China Sea caused the boat to sink .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#115:2>
Fortunately , Strange-eyed and a handful of others managed to
clamber into a lifeboat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#116:2>
They were floating in what seemed to the others like an unending
stretch of turbulent water when Strange-eyed exclaimed ,  ' Land ahoy!'

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#117:2>
Because of his gift , he was able to see the land mass of Annam
which was miles away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#118:2>
Guided by Strange-eyed they finally reached land .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#119:2>
The other survivors , some of whom were Annamese , were so grateful
that they gave Strange-eyed enough money and provisions for him to make his
way to Bangkok overland. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#120:2>
In those days , there was already a big Chinese population in
Bangkok - nearly half a million - and they were engaged in feverish
commercial activity .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#121:2>
Once in Bangkok , he set about looking for suitable work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#122:2>
He apprenticed himself to a clock and watch repairman , and - again
thanks to his extraordinary eyesight - he mastered the delicate skills
required by the profession very quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#123:2>
In those days such talent was rare , and word of his dexterity
spread quickly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#124:2>
He was soon able to open his own repair shop and to make a very
comfortable living .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#125:2>
Once he had saved enough money , he began to ponder how to go into
business in a big way .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#126:2>
Like Jim Thompson over a century later , he saw great potential in
the Thai silk industry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#127:2>
His native Nanhai was a centre for silk production .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#128:2>
He set up a silk factory in Bangkok , then another and another .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#129:2>
He was not only entrepreneurial but also artistic , using his
considerable artistic talent to create new patterns and designs for the silk
produced in his factories .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#130:2>
Legend has it that when he was just nineteen , Strange-eyed made his
way to France to study the use of machines in the production of silk .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#131:2>
His eyes served him well in his role as industrial spy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#132:2>
He saw the blueprints for a new machine on the desk of one of the
managers some forty or so feet away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#133:2>
Because he was familiar with the process of production and because
he had a photographic memory he was able to reproduce the plans when he
returned home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#134:2>
He had machines , powered by steam , made by an engineering shop in
Guangzhou in his native China , where he also set up factories .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#135:2>
With the new machines he was able to improve the quality and
quantity of the silk his factories produced .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#136:2>
He was soon employing nearly one thousand workers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#137:2>
I have heard that later on he outbid rival Chinese in an auction for
a royal monopoly of gambling Bangkok .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#138:2>
This set him firmly on the road to fabulous wealth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-020#139:2>
By the age of thirty , Strange-eyed had brought his growing
family to live in Nanhai , but he retained his business interest in Siam ,
and these continued to enrich his sons and grandsons .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#140:2>
I have been told he had three sons .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#141:2>
The second , Chun Nam , was the King  ' s father , and was born in
1856 .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#142:2>
To the concubines of the King , he was known as  ' Old Master ' .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#143:2>
They gave little though to what he was called in the macrocosm
outside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#144:2>
One concubine claimed with pride ,  ' Ours is a scholar  ' s family.'

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#145:2>
Her grounds for this allegation ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#146:2>
In his youth Old Master , lee Chun Nam , had gone to the capital to
take the imperial examinations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#147:2>
These jinshi examinations had for thousands of years been used by
the Chinese government to select people for high official positions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#148:2>
He had studied hard and did  ' very well ' in the examinations .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#149:2>
He was told that he had succeeded in securing a third-tier award ,
something which was highly regarded .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#150:2>
But , according to the story , a corrupt Qing official refused to
confer the honour until he had been given &dollar;200 as a bribe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#151:2>
His father , Strange-eyed , was furious and refused to pay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#152:2>
He said to his son ,  ' If we have to pay for it the honour is
worthless .

<ICE-HK:W2F-020#153:2>
You will take the examinations again next year .  '  </p>
