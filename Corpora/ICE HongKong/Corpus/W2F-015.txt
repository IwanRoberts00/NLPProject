<h> <bold> KELVIN AU </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#2:1>
<bold> A CERTAIN DESIRE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#3:1>
The invitation had read , &ldquo; Sub-Saharan African art . Now in
the heart of Hong Kong . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#4:1>
Which meant the tangle of streets now known as Soho: a maze of steep ,
winding streets lined with pre-war walk-ups , their street level spaces
converted into a grab bag of restaurants serving up the new , the trendy ,
the unusual; Nepalese taverns of cultivated strangeness rubbed shoulders with
nouvelle Aussie eateries , Spanish tapas bars settled in next to the
ubiquitous Starbucks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#5:1>
As Frank took the Central Escalator that winded its way up the side of
the hill , the usual sense of entering settled in .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#6:1>
He always felt a little out of place here in this expat cantonment ,
just down the road from what used to be the governor  ' s residence but which
was now an empty relic , resurrected occasionally by the present government  ' s
senior members for formal engagements , but the rest of the time was left
unused , unsure of what its role could be in this new , unfamiliar city .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#7:1>
Not that Frank should have any real reason to feel uneasy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#8:1>
True , as a small , slightly-build man , he always felt vaguely
lilliputian walking into Soho on a weekend , when it would be a land of
giants , most of whom would resist the chill of the air-conditioned
restaurants and congregate instead in herds on the sidewalks , withdrawing
into the expensively dressed establishments only when a further round of
drinks was required .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#9:1>
But this was also where the rich and powerful came to meet the young
and beautiful; where gay bars encircled and cosied up to the Central police
station; where the random snippets of conversation that might linger in the
evening air would be in English , or American or Australian , or French or
German .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#10:1>
And of course Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#11:1>
However , that locals were most often seen , young couples mainly ,
posing and having their pictures taken , with the pitched , uneven
cobblestone streets as a backdrop , suggested an inclination to see this as
some kind of theme-park , a strange alternative-world .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#12:1>
Perhaps it was the compression of these differences into a temporary
community that intensified these feelings , and the possibilities of either
connection , or conflict . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#13:1>
When he arrived , the two owners of the gallery , Peter and Peter
, were both in mid-conversation with their guests , and briefly smiled their
welcomes to him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#14:1>
Not wanting to interrupt them , he smiled back and casually headed
for the drinks table .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#15:1>
As he waited for his glass of wine , he continued to survey the
gathering , social smile locked in place , and found to his belief that it
was a mixed crowd .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#16:1>
He recognised most of the gay contingent , busy trading sir-kisses
and gossip , with the occasional gasped " daarling &rdquo; audible above the
steady murmur of conversation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#17:1>
The straight crowd on the whole was more differently chatting amongst
themselves , but there was a steady intermingling of camps , as Chinese and
Western boyfriends were introduced to and by husbands and wives , cheerfully
united in their determination to discuss anything but art .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#18:1>
Frank was old enough to recognise that there were just rituals ,
social unctions that had helped generations of strangers seem less strange to
each other , but was still young enough to feel that he should take these
moments for their transients , reassuring worth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#19:1>
Frank noticed that there were quite a number of good-looking men
in attendance .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#20:1>
He wondered who it was that said all good men were either gay or
married , and why was it that he , on the other hand , frequently found
straight men attractive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#21:1>
Public displays of machismo he found of course quite ridiculous: a
swaggering John Wayne strut , ball-scratching , loud discussions of women ,
cars , beer and contact sports in general , were beyond his ken .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#22:1>
Growing up in south-western Ontario , he had come to accept that he
would never be anything like the North American ideal of masculine
attractiveness: the Tom Sellecks and Robert Redfords , and later the Mel
Gibsons , Brad Pitts and Tom Cruises , adored by women and gay men alike ,
were nothing like him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#23:1>
As he grew , Frank moved beyond noticing the more obvious
distinctions , the blue , green , hazel eyes , the fairer , wavier hair ,
discovering more subtle differences of proportion: the larger hands , the
sturdier digits , the shorter torsor , the plumper butts of his Western
brothers .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#24:1>
He did not need a mirror to know that he would never look like them ,
conscious of the distance between his reality and the ideals that shaped them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#25:1>
Almost instinctively , he grasped for other trappings of identity
that he could use , and found a ready-made substitute in political activity .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#26:1>
In an era of AIDS panic , begin gay meant having a political role ,
and this he embraced with alacrity , finding a sense of reassurance through
protest marches , rallies , volunteer work , all of which allowed him to feel
like part of the community he could never embody . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#27:1>
Pondering this , he found that he had been staring at a tall
blond man not far from him , who was speaking on his mobile , gesticulating
slightly with his brochure .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#28:1>
Frank couldn't hear him , but gradually realised that his eyes were
steadily holding his own .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#29:1>
Instinctively , Frank turned his attention to the nearest Shona
sculpture , a free-standing head , face upturned , lips pouting as if
straining to catch rainwater from a drainpipe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#30:1>
Perhaps he should have described the lips more lyrically as preparing
to accept a kiss , but - he looked again - no , she was definitely catching
water from a drainpipe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#31:1>
Staring at the silent head , he wondered how long he had been doing
the same to the man .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#32:1>
He recalled that cruising had become a big political statement in the
West , a gesture of empowerment through gay-identification that , as far as
he could see , would have been more honestly recognised as letching , a
simple movement of a man  ' s brain from his skull to his crotch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#33:1>
In Ontario , this gaze had been practised with discretion , except
perhaps for the lust laden crossfire that was a permanent fixture at Church
and Wellesley , but then that was Toronto , a centre of political correctness
that sheltered that marginalized and reinforced their strangeness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#34:1>
Hong Kong had come as a revelation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#35:1>
The physical distinctions lost their force , and his need for
political activity slipped away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#36:1>
He found that he was now perceived as being attractive .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#37:1>
How thin , he thought , had his political gestures been if now he
hardly missed them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#38:1>
To his new friends he would remark from time to time on the political
indifference of Hong Kong: <it> can you imagine holding a Pride march here ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#39:1>
No one would show: all the queens would be down at Joyce , shopping .
</it>

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#40:1>
Yes , he thought , I  ' ve sold out , we  ' ve all sold out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#41:1>
And even more perversely , he found that he missed being
different , a minority .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#42:1>
His friends called him a banana - yellow on the outside , white on
the inside - teasing which he accepted with good humour .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#43:1>
He would admit with a wry smile that it was a nuisance , nor being
able to read menus , local newspapers , street signs , but the colonial
legacy was such that , under the city  ' s collective skin , there was enough
English around for him to get by .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#44:1>
And he did , curiously , with ease .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#45:1>
He could not say that the locals were particularly friendly;
certainly he did not miss the irritating and how-are-you-today  ' s of North
America; people here were often rude , pushy , vulgar , but mainly
indifference , the outgrown of a past they never particularly believed in ,
the temperament of yet another metropolis hurting only towards the future .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#46:1>
So , attractive at last .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#47:1>
This was something .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#48:1>
He wondered why he felt no accompanying sense of elation .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#49:1>
In an effort to correct this lack of response , he increased his
participation in local pastimes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#50:1>
He joined a gay volleyball league , and went with his team-mates on
their group excursions: shopping , dim sum and even the dreaded karaoke .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#51:1>
It was during this time that he started dating Patrick . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#52:1>
Dating .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#53:1>
He could barley being himself to say the word .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#54:1>
Patrick , however , the sturdy setter and captain of the team , the
first of his family to go to university , earnest , closeted , believed
unwaveringly in it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#55:1>
The rituals of grocery shopping , holding hands at the movies , the
quests for quality time together were absolutely necessary to him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#56:1>
Frank acquiesced , hoping that he too would grow to like these things
, until about three months into the relationship , after a particularly long
day at work , the last few hours of which were spent continuously answering
Patrick  ' s calls and assuring him that there was no need to wait for him , he
couldn't tell when he  ' d be done , he  ' s see him tomorrow , Frank left the
office to find Patrick outside , standing on the sidewalk , waiting for him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#57:1>
It was close to midnight , raining steadily and he could just make
out the gleam of the umbrella  ' s steel shaft next to Patrick  ' s face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#58:1>
What could he say ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#59:1>
Exasperated , ears ref from the consciousness of his own ingratitude
, he said nothing , letting Patrick put his arm around him and pull him into
the street .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#60:1>
The streets in Wanchai were never deserted it seemed , even at
midnight , even in the middle of the week , but apart from the occasional
curious glace from the stoned expat kids swaying outside the 24-hour
convenience stores , no one took any interest in two men huddled under an
umbrella , an arm slung over a shoulder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#61:1>
He  ' d noticed that the code of straight camaraderie here ,
astoundingly , allowed men to walk the streets in this sort of embrace .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#62:1>
Where had this tradition come from ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#63:1>
Not the British , surely .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#64:1>
But then again , why not ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#65:1>
How much did he really know about colonial customs ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#66:1>
Did these former rulers find , in the topical heat , satiated with
power and gin , that sometimes the trappings of masculinity can be allowed to
slide ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#67:1>
He realised suddenly that the entire right side of his body ,
unsheltered by the umbrella , was completely soaked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#68:1>
&ldquo; Patrick , where are we going ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#69:1>
&ldquo; Nowhere , &rdquo; he shrugged .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#70:1>
&ldquo; We  ' re just ... wandering .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#71:1>
Just walking around . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#72:1>
&ldquo; Why ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#73:1>
&ldquo; What do you man  '  why ?  '  , &rdquo; he snapped , nonplussed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#74:1>
&ldquo; That  ' s what couples do .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#75:1>
That  ' s dating . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#76:1>
Halfway through this retort , Frank had started heaving a deep sign ,
which only seemed to further incense Patrick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#77:1>
&ldquo; What  ' s the matter with you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#78:1>
I  ' ve been waiting for you for hours .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#79:1>
I come to pick you up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#80:1>
Can't you just do this for me ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#81:1>
This was ridiculous .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#82:1>
So , underneath the hetero front , just another hysterical queen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#83:1>
What was the point of telling him that these rituals were stupid ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#84:1>
For fuck  ' s sake , you  ' re gay , he wanted to scream , you have a
choice , <it> we </it> have a choice: why would we want to be , no , <it>
pretend </it> to be a straight couple ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#85:1>
Why would you want to imitate the lives of the people who leer at and
ostracise you , who regard you as freaks , or pretend you don't exist ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#86:1>
The umbrella was on the pavement .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#87:1>
They were both drenched , rivulets of water streaming down their
faces , blinking fury at each other . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#88:1>
&ldquo; I can't do this anymore , Patrick .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#89:1>
It  ' s just .. . not working out for me . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#90:1>
&ldquo; What you really need is a gweilo . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#91:1>
Where the hell did that come from ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#92:1>
Patrick had not stopped glowering , and a tremble was just detectable
in his voice as he continued , &ldquo; What you need is a gweilo boyfriend
because either you really are just a gweilo , even as you try to deny it... .
&rdquo; He paused .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#93:1>
Then , unblinking , fired point blank: &ldquo; .. . or you really
don't like who you are , and haven't got the guts to face it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#94:1>
You hate being one of us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#95:1>
And you hate yourself . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#96:1>
With that Patrick pushed past him and lurched down the street , into
the downpour and darkness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#97:1>
&ldquo; It  ' s quite nice , this one . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#98:1>
The vision had spoken .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#99:1>
Frank looked up from the silent head and regarded the smiling one
looking down at him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#100:1>
He noticed that the man  ' s eyebrows were even blonder than the hair
on his head , curving upwards at the bridge of his nose , and together with
the sight crooked smile , gave him a look of wry amusement .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#101:1>
A South African , he  ' s seen it all before , his name was Jan , what
was his ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#102:1>
And how did he like the art ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#103:1>
Frank smiled at the distinctive shape of the Afrikaner vowels and
said he hadn't seen this sort of thing before , so it was new to him , quite
interesting , he supposed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#104:1>
&ldquo; I  ' m not really qualified to judge , I  ' m afraid , &rdquo;
he ended , smiling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#105:1>
Ah , humility , modesty , deferral .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#106:1>
Remembering Patrick , his throat tightened with shame .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#107:1>
What was worse , it seemed to work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#108:1>
A further distracted stroll around the gallery led to an invitation
to join him for dinner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#109:1>
&ldquo; I don't usually do this , but my boyfriend is out of town on
business , &rdquo; he added .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#110:1>
Frank had a choice then , a choice to take the high moral ground and
decline , or to give in to the stirring in his pants .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#111:1>
At such moments time does not stand still , as the cliché goes.

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#112:1>
Nor does one hear alarm bells , which is another one .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#113:1>
Frank felt himself attempting to map what the implications of his
answer would be .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#114:1>
But Jan  ' s face , its expression , was all that he was conscious of
, apart from the alarming clarity of his own breathing , the short ,
resonating breaths that he tried to suppress but was sure could be heard .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#115:1>
&ldquo; I understand , &rdquo; he replied , understanding only
that a pact had been agreed tom a measure of separate consciences , both now
put aside . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-015#116:1>
Later he would remember from that night only short , shape
images of Jan  ' s body , hirsute and long-limbed , damp with sweat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#117:1>
How the same expression of furrowed intensity , in different
positions , from different angles , seemed to make him different men: one of
the charms of an unfamiliar body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#118:1>
Later Jan became vaguely engrossed with examining him , explaining
that he thought all Chinese men were uncut .

<ICE-HK:W2F-015#119:1>
&ldquo; Lapsed Christian , &rdquo; Frank replied . </p>
