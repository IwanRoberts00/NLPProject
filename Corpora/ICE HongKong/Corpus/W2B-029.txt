There are altogether 49 native species of snakes in Hong Kong ,
all of which belong to six families: Typhiopidae , Boidae , Colubridae ,
Elapidae , Hydrophiidae and Viperidae .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#6:1>
People generally have the misconception that all snakes are poisonous .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#7:1>
In fact , most snakes are harmless .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#8:1>
Currently there are only nine species of highly venomous
land snakes in Hong Kong , four of which are wither uncommon or
rarely seen .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#9:1>
There are five other kinds of snakes that are only mildly 
venomous &obrack;  venom may cause short-term
swelling , pain , headache , nausea  &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#10:1>
Therefore , a fatal snakebite is quite rare in Hong Kong . </p> <O>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#11:1>
Venom of venomous snakes is the most powerful and effective
tool for killing prey within a short period of time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#12:1>
After venom  is injected into the prey  ' s body ,
an enzyme in the  venom  starts pre-digesting the body
tissue before the snake consumes the prey .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#13:1>
As  venom  is valuable to the snake itself , it
will not waste a drop of it unless it is necessary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#14:1>
You may sometimes hear that people got bitten by a Cobra without
being poisoned , as no  venom  was injected .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#15:1>
Nevertheless , one should always beware of the snakebites as it is
impossible to tell exactly when a snake will inject its venom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#16:1>
Snakes also play an important role in maintaining balance in an
ecosystem .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#17:1>
They generally prefer to prey on rats , and thus can control the
abundance of rats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#18:1>
Despite their ecological important , people often kill snakes
indiscriminately as they believe all snakes are harmful to mankind .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#19:1>
Besides , snakes are frequently caught in the wild and then sold in
animal market as South China is a larger consumer of wild snakes for food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#20:1>
Together with other human pressure such as habitat destruction , man
has posed a great threat to these widely misunderstood creatures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#21:1>
The existence of a healthy population of snakes is critical to
maintaining a healthy food web .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#22:1>
With better understanding , we can be friends with snakes and live
with them in harmony ! </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#23:1>
<bold> Do you know ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#24:1>
Snakes have a very good sense of smell .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#25:1>
They use their forked tongues to detect chemical particles in the air
, and then find out where their prey is .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#26:1>
Some snakes have very good eyesight , like the Colubridae , which
hunt with their keen vision as well as sense of smell .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#27:1>
Others like vipers and pythons have a pair of infra-red heat pits ,
which detect body heat of warm-blooded animals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#28:1>
With this tool , the snakes of this family can detect their prey in
total darkness . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O>

body; but brown , grey or golden Chinese cobra can sometimes be found ,
especially in the northeastern part of the New territories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#33:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> The Chinese Cobra is the most common
 venomous  land snake in Hong Kong according to our
records .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#34:1>
It can be found in a great variety of habitats: scrubland , grassland
, fishpond and open area .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#35:1>
If frightened , it will expand its neck hood and create a hissing
sound in order to scare the predators away . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O>

<bold> ID features: </bold> Fully-grown adult is a huge version
of Chinese cobra that can reach 6 m in length .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#38:1>
Their body is dark brown or black in colour with transverse bands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#39:1>
The body of juvenile King cobra is also black in colour , but instead
it bears bright yellow/golden bands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#40:1>
Compared with the Chinese cobra , the King cobra  ' s neck hood is
longer and narrower .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#41:1>
In addition , two distinctively enlarged postparietal scales can be
seen on the snakes ' head . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#42:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> The King cobra isn't simply the  ' King ' of
cobras , it can be regarded as the  ' King ' of land  venomous
 snakes because it is the largest  venomous 
snake , and it likes to prey on other snakes !

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#43:1>
Similar to the Chinese cobra , it occurs in a various kinds of
habitats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#44:1>
Female will make their egg chamber among leaves or plant debris , and
they incubate their eggs with the heat generated by shivering .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#45:1>
Those females guarding their eggs are reported to be the most
dangerous snakes to human .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#46:1>
Nonetheless , King cobra is not commonly seen in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#47:1>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#64:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> Bamboo snake is the second commonest
 venomous  snake in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#65:1>
It becomes the culprit in most snakebite cases because of its lazy
and aggressive behaviours .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#66:1>
Normally bamboo snakes will not avoid people .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#67:1>
Instead , when there is someone approaching , they will curve their
body in S-shape and get ready to strike the invader .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#68:1>
Bamboo snakes like to hide under leaves or in grassland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#69:1>
Its green  camouflage  renders it being difficult
to see .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#70:1>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#101:2>
<bold> Is expensive mineral water about good health or good
marketing ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#102:2>
<bold> W </bold> e  ' ve all been told we need to drink eight
glasses of water a day , but how do you know which kind ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#103:2>
There  ' s carbonated , mineral , oxygenated ... even waters promising
to deliver the same advantages as a cup of coffee or Viagra .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#104:2>
Do you believe the hype , or do you suspect a &dollar;29 bottle of
water is just as food as the stuff coming out of your tap ? </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#105:2>
<bold> Hard or Soft ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#106:2>
Doctors and nutritionists break down water into two categories -
soft water and hard water .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#107:2>
Hard water has a high mineral content and should , in theory , offer
more health benefits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#108:2>
Soft water , distilled water for example , does not have mineral
content , therefore it doesn't really offer much .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#109:2>
But because the minerals affect the taste of the water , not
everyone likes the hard stuff .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#110:2>
In fact , Nick Reitmeier , General manager of Great Supermarket ,
explains that , of the 60 brands of water Great sells , some are definitely
more palatable because they don't have any mineral content . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#111:2>
<bold> Claim to Fame </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#112:2>
Mineral waters labels make bold claims about fresh volcanic
springs and natural mountain minerals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#113:2>
And the truth is , our bodies actually do require certain minerals
that some waters claim to contain , specifically  magnesium
 and  calcium  .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#114:2>
There are also two essential minerals a lot of us don't get enough
of . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#115:2>
Most of us know  calcium  is stored in our
bones , about 99&percent; of it , and it  ' s also a vital component for our
teeth to prevent cavities and fight tooth decay .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#116:2>
But  calcium  is also needed in order for
 magnesium  to work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#117:2>
 Magnesium  is needed for the building of your
bones , protein and fatty acids .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#118:2>
It  ' s also essential for making new cells , activating Vitamin B ,
blood-clotting and muscle relaxation - it may even help lower blood pressure
, and potentially improve the vision of people suffering from glaucoma . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#119:2>
But not all minerals are good for you .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#120:2>
Most waters also certain amounts of sodium , which have negative
side effects .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#121:2>
Excessive intake of sodium can cause heart problems , including high
blood pressure and heart attacks - not to mention water retention and
bloating . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#122:2>
<bold> Is It Enough ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#123:2>
So if mineral waters really do contain some important minerals ,
is it really worth the extra cash ?

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#124:2>
Not according to Dr . Edmund Lee , a Hong Kong University Associate
Professor who teaches course on food and nutrition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#125:2>
He says the  magnesium  and  calcium
 intake from mineral water is not significant , and so drinking
mineral water isn't necessarily the nest way to get these minerals into your
system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#126:2>
&ldquo; Of course I am not saying people should stop drinking
mineral water .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#127:2>
However , it is just not practical to rely on the water for mineral
supply .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#128:2>
In general , a person needs about 100mg of  calcium
 every day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#129:2>
While mineral water can only fulfil a small percentage of what our
body needs , milk , as a matter of fact , is a lot more practical .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#130:2>
One serving of milk can meet 30&percent; of our daily 
calcium  needs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#131:2>
Comparatively speaking , mineral water doesn't really help that much .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#132:2>
Johnny Hanson , one of the founders of the American Nutrition
Center , agrees .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#133:2>
" Mineral water does not have a significant amount of the minerals
that we need , it  ' s not enough to make a big difference . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#134:2>
He does , however , point a different advantage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#135:2>
&ldquo; I do recommend those who participate in marathon sports -
for example those who run and hike for a long time - to take mineral water in
order to replace the electrolytes they have lost in sweat . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#136:2>
Electrolytes are important in maintaining voltage across cell
membranes and to carry electrical impulses between nerve cells and muscle
cells . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#137:2>
<bold> Healthy Waters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#138:2>
Then there are the waters that are considered to have real
medicinal purposes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#139:2>
According to Great  ' s Reitmeier , a lot of European doctors suggest
patients drink Apollinaris - which they call &ldquo; health water . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#140:2>
Appollinaris has high levels of  magnesium  &obrack; 
6&percent; &cbrack; and low levels of sodium &obrack;  4&percent;); ideal for those with
digestive problems , they say . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#141:2>
There might be some truth to this , as HKU  ' s Dr . Lee mentions
that people who live in areas with hard water tend to have better general
health - assuming they  ' re drinking out of the tap . - <it> Katie Luk </it>

Nighttime seems to be specially designed for owls .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#145:3>
However , some herons such as the Night Herons share the silence
with these night creatures .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#146:3>
The Night Heron is a nocturnal bird which forages at night ,
although it can also be seen during daytime especially during breeding season .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#147:3>
Adult Night Heron can easily be separable with other kinds of
herons: the dorsal side of the bird is dark blue in colour , with a couple of
elongated plumage extended behind the head .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#148:3>
The wings are white and the ventral side is grayish , bit of these
are visible when the bird is in flight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#149:3>
Take a closer look and you can even see the bright red eyes and
yellow feet .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#150:3>
Immature Night Heron is brownish and covered with white spots ,
which act as an excellent  camouflage  for it to avoid
predators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-029#151:3>
The Night Heron breeds in colony like may other egrets and
herons do .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#152:3>
Wetlands such as shrimp ponds , fishponds and other shallow waters
are the major foraging habitats for the species , where they hunt for small
fish and shrimps .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#153:3>
At dusk flock upon flock can be seen departing from the daytime
roost towards the foraging grounds , and by dawn they will return .

<ICE-HK:W2B-029#154:3>
Night Heron can also be seen in urban parks , which provides
excellent viewing conditions . </p>
