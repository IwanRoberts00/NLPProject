Mr. yeung

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#23:3>
I know that u want to get some good stuff .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#24:3>
OK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#25:3>
In unix you do the following .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#26:3>
&obrack; Type &cbrack; ftp asia.lcs.mit.edu

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#27:3>
Now u have enter the ftp and you can do &obrack; ls=dir in dos
&crback; to list all the files .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#28:3>
U can also do &obrack; cd &obrack; directory name &cbrack; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#29:3>
Or simply type &obrack; ? &cbrack; to list all the functions .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#30:3>
That ftp asia.lcs.mit.edu put all the Hong Kong stars  '  pictures in
pub/hongkong/hkpa/popstars/female

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#31:3>
Moreover , I found another ftp address .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#32:3>
This address contains thousands of pictures .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#33:3>
Yet , these pictures can only be obtained in 3:00am , 10:00am and
4:00pm , Hong Kong  ' s time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#34:3>
There are a lot of <-> Japaneses </-> <+> Japanese </+> stars  ' 
pictures in this address . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#35:3>
&obrack; Type &cbrack; ftp 140.117.11.3

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#36:3>
Name ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#37:3>
&obrack; Type &cbrack; anonymous

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#38:3>
Password &obrack; Type &cbrack; 92905420@

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#39:3>
&obrack; Type whoever login  ' s account number &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#40:3>
Then you should be able to access all the <-> goode  ' s </-> <+>
goodie  ' s </+> files .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#41:3>
all the Japanese stars  '  files are located in the following
directory:

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#42:3>
graphics/jpg/east-girl/Japan-star

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#43:3>
get &obrack; filename &cbrack; or mget &obrack; &asterisk; .
&asterisk; &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#44:3>
Of course , you also want to download those files into your account .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#45:3>
U need to type , e.g. you want to download Anne001.gtf into your A
drive y disk in the file called photo/Ann1.gtf then u need to type : &obrack;
type &cbrack; sz Anne001.gtf a:photo/Ann1.gtf

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#46:3>
&obrack; in your modem  ' s software u should choose <mention> Receive
file </mention> &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#47:3>
If you want to look at these pictures at school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#48:3>
In unix you type:

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#49:3>
&obrack; type &cbrack; xv &obrack; filename &cbrack; OR &obrack; type
&cbrack; xv &obrack; wildcards &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#50:3>
Ok.

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#51:3>
I hope u enjoy those pictures .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#52:3>
By the way , I have a feeling that Brazil is going to win this World
Cup and they will <-> bit </-> <+> beat </+> Germany in the final game .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#53:3>
Oh !

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#54:3>
If you want to get out of ftp any time you just need to &obrack; type

Hey Mat. Yeung

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#66:5>
I tried my new soccer boots today ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#67:5>
it was amazing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#68:5>
The boots were so light that I felt I was wearing nothing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#69:5>
Plus , it can really put some amazing curve on the ball . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#70:5>
I  ' ve call Eurosport , the soccer catalog ordering company ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#71:5>
they said they will send you a catalog tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#72:5>
Yet , it won't be first class air mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#73:5>
I guess they will send it by surface .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#74:5>
They told me that you should receive the catalog within one month .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#75:5>

Hey M. Yeung

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#88:8>
Good to know that u are doing fine at school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#89:8>
I am so busy now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#90:8>
U said that Chan Wai Tak , went to Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#91:8>
That should be a new challenge for him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#92:8>
<-> I </-> <+> my </+> knee is fine now but it is so cold here that
no one play soccer outdoor .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#93:8>
I should be able to play again next year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#94:8>
I don't think I am going to go back to HK for the next few years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#95:8>
First of all , I need to finish my degree .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#96:8>
School is like hell !

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#97:8>
I study hard <-> everyday</-> <+> every day </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#98:8>
I may need 1.5 more years to graduate because I lost a lot of credits
when I <-> transfered </-> <+> transferred </+> to a new Canadian University .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#99:8>
I tried to finish my degree as fast as I can ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#100:8>
unfortunately , some courses are not offer in some terms , so I have
to delay my graduation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#101:8>
Mainly , due to the <-> buget </-> <+> budget </+> problem arise of
the University .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#102:8>
Classes are not offer as frequently as they were and classes are a
lot bigger .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#103:8>
Do u have time to meet a gal friend ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#104:8>
My <-> advise </-> <+> advice </+> is get a gal friend that can take
care of u .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#105:8>
Now , I am so busy <-> everyday </-> <+> every day </+> that I don't
have any time to do anything , except for studying .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#106:8>
Do u know that Henry Pang is studying in this University ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#107:8>
I didn't talk to him much simply because he seems to have a lot of
free time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#108:8>
Unlike Henry , I am fighting to get enough sleep <-> everyday</->
<+> every day </+> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#109:8>
Well , I need to study now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#110:8>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#140:12>
Oh !

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#141:12>
Pat , you are a really a dull and boring girl with &ldquo; usual
&rdquo; interests &ampersand; hobbies such as listening to classic instead of
the &ldquo; Four Kings &rdquo; , playing piano at the contrast of playing
majong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#142:12>
You are an extremely out of fashion girl . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#143:12>

I took the graduation photo last month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#170:15>
I would duplicate the most pretty one and send it to you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#171:15>
The coming January to March , I will practice in the hospital as a
full time nurse .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#172:15>
If I have not failed within the three months , I will graduate .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#173:15>
I am quite nervous of failing the last course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#174:15>
As I know that some last year students were failed from a fourth
year course .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#175:15>
I hope I won't be one of them .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#176:15>
How about you ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#177:15>
I send a Christmas card to Peggy but it was returned back from
post office .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#178:15>
I think her office probably was moved to a new place .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#179:15>
Do you know how to contact her ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#180:15>
I am glad that I will graduate soon as I am really tired of
studying .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#181:15>
It makes you to become mature .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#182:15>
This year our objective focus on psychiatric and palliative .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#183:15>
I have to take care cancer patients and their families .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#184:15>
I am very exhausted and upset when my patients die .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#185:15>
I think I won't choose palliative as my future job as I am not
ready right now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#186:15>
What about your future plan ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#187:15>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#190:16> Hi Pat ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#191:16> How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#192:16> I glad to receive your e-mail again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#193:16> I have received your letter , too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#194:16> I think you are really happy with your trip to Europe .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#195:16> I am dreaming of getting the same vacation as you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#196:16> I am now working on my last semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#197:16> I have got a lot of stuff to do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#198:16> I have to do many research papers , projects and presentations .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#199:16> Although I only take 3 courses this semester , they are hard . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#200:16> I hope I will go back to HK after my graduation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#201:16> If the working environment is good , maybe I will stay in HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#202:16> It still too early to make any decisions .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#203:16> How about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#204:16> What kind of jobs are you going to find after graduation ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#205:16> I have heard that nearly everyone of you are working in the
accounting area .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#206:16> I am also studying in accounting .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#207:16> Is it a really good work field ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#208:16> From the letter , you told me that you are doubt about the
future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#209:16> I think that we should face the future positively .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#210:16> Don't be too afraid to face the reality .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#211:16> It is time for us to grow up .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#212:16> Getting to work is the turning point of our life .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#213:16> Although we are afraid of accepting the truth , we still need to
face it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#214:16> Talking to your <-> firends </-> <+> friends </+> will really help
you to solve the doubt .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#215:16> I think Peggy and Katy are good candidates to ask for .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#216:16> Talk to them , I think they will give you some guidances and <->
opions </-> <+> opinions </+> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#217:16> Talk to you later .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#218:16> I have to prepare my presentation next week now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#219:16> Hope you will be happy forever .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#220:16> Happy Chinese New Year . </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#221:17> Dearest Patricia,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#222:17> Happy New Year to you and your family !

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#223:17> Do you receive Catherine  ' s letter ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#224:17> She is very busy with the school work for this last semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#225:17> Although I do not have to take any course in the University now , I
have to practice in a hospital for three months .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#226:17> I have to work with twelve hours shift .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#227:17> That is I am not allowed to sleep for twelve hours in order to take
care of patients if I am in night shift .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#228:17> I feel sorry for mom who has been worked as a nurse for more than
<-> thiry </-> <+> thirty </+> years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#229:17> I also feel sorry for myself as I just start to be a nurse for
unknown year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#230:17> I have been studied in faculty of nursing for four years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#231:17> Would you correct the wrong message for me if you have time ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#232:17> As Rositta send a letter to me and stated that she is glad to hear
that I took the accounting in university as her .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#233:17> I  ' m sorry to make you guys so confusing with what I have been
studied in the University . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#234:17> I haven't specialised in any field of nursing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#235:17> I think I will work as a general nurse such as working in either
medical ward or surgical ward .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#236:17> After I build up my experiences , I will work as a community nurse
who will provide nursing care in community rather than in hospital .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#237:17> I understand that you felt you haven't learned too much from the
University .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#238:17> You are not alone as a lot of friends even my brother has the same
experiences as you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#239:17> I think what we have learned from University can help us to
organise and think logically which is very important in problem solving and
creative working in our future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#240:17> As the society requests more people to have higher education , we
can only protect ourselves by following this trend .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#241:17> Let  ' s work hard and looking forward to graduate soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#242:17> I hope this can make you feel better .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#243:17> If you have time , please keep contact with each other . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#244:17> Your friend

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#245:17> Winnie Wan . </I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#251:18> My final will be ended on 19th April .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#252:18> Then I will finish my undergraduate .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#253:18> I think I will stay here to find a job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#254:18> After I have obtained the citizenship &obrack; I think it may be in
Sept/Oct &cbrack; , I will go back to HK to see whether it is suitable for me
to stay in HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#255:18> Do you have any planning in the future ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#256:18> Did any of our sisters &obrack; Katy , Peggy , Rositta , etc
&cbrack; give you some suggestions ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#257:18> I think I will need all your help when I come back to HK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#258:18> When is the date of your convocation ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#259:18> I think you are looking forward for that day to come &obrack; as me
&cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-005#260:18> I want to noticed you that my e-mail account will expired at
the end of April , so we have to communicate through letters in the future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#261:18> Although it is <-> inconveninent </-> <+> inconvenient </+> , we
should still keep in touch .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#262:18> As all our sisters have started to work , it seems that we started
to communicate less and less .

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#263:18> I hope we can talk more in the future . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-005#264:18> Ok , talk to you later .
