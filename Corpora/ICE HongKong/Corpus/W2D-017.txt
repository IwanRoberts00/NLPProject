Hong Kong has a remote island of a very high scientific importance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#7:1>
It is located at the eastern part of Hong Kong and is famous for its
unique rock formations .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#8:1>
It has been a very popular field trip location for geography students
for many years .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#9:1>
As scuba diving gets popular , it is also becoming famous for its
coral abundance and variety .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#10:1>
If you are a reader of <it> Hong Kong Discovery </it> , you should
know it quite well ~ Tung Ping Chau &obrack;  or Ping Chau &cbrack; . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<bold> W </bold> ith the increasing public awareness of
environmental conservation and the blooming of eco-tourism , Tung Ping Chau
has become quite popular in recent years and was designated as the fourth
marine park in Hong Kong in November 2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#16:1>
Because of its remote location and limited human impact , the natural
environment of Tung Ping Chau is well preserved .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#17:1>
In addition , as it is located far away from the Pearl River Delta ,
it suffers minimal impact of the muddy freshwater of the river .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#18:1>
As a result , the water quality there is relatively good and allows a
wide range of marine life to flourish .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#19:1>
In fact , Tung Ping Chau may have the richest hard coral diversity in
Hong Kong - more than 40 species .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#20:1>
Moreover , it is home to over 40 species of algae and over 100
species of marine invertebrates .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#21:1>
For fish lovers , the fish diversity here will not disappoint you .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#22:1>
Hard corals in Tung Ping Chau are most densely populated in areas
next to Tai Tong Wan and between A Ma Wan and Kan Lau Shek .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#23:1>
They form large communities in area shallower than 15 feet with the
majority aggregated in shallow shore areas .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#24:1>
Like the hard coral in Hoi Ha Wan , some of them are exposed to the
air during low tides .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#25:1>
The water visibility there is unusually good . It is not uncommon to
have visibility over 20 feet .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#26:1>
The hard coral communities can therefore be easily seen directly from
boat .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#27:1>
In these areas , you can find a lot of coral-associated marine
organisms .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#28:1>
Butterfly fishes and sweepers are abundant .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#29:1>
Also , it is common to see cornets , moray eels , squids , sweetlips
, sea horses , yellowtail barracudas and various species of snappers ,
wrasses , groupers , and gobies , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#30:1>
Some of the species sometimes occur in small groups .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#31:1>
I have seen more than 10 sweetlips wandering around together in one
dive and more than 20 yellowtail barracudas in another dive .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#32:1>
Apart from these common animals , the rarely seen pipefish can also
be found here .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#33:1>
For invertebrates , there are nudibranchs , interesting spider crabs
, shrimps , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#34:1>
In the area near Kan Lau Shek , there are large communities of sea
anemones and associated shrimps and anemone fishes . </p> <O> Chinese

&obrack;  The sea anemone in the above three photos should belong to the
same species , but their colour is quite different. &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#40:1>
When going to areas deeper than 15 feet , you will find that the
whole area is a gentle sandy slope .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#41:1>
Although it looks like a desert , it is the place where you can find
the timid sole fish , starfish , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#42:1>
If you are lucky enough , you may see the amazing butterfly ray too .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#43:1>
Occasionally , large schools of tiny silvery fishes move around
quickly , probably fleeing away from predators .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#44:1>
If you go deeper , you may find some colourful soft corals and
gorgonians .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#45:1>
However , the visibility there is poorer . </p> <O> Chinese

In the area between Kan Lau Shek and Lung Lok Shui , the seabed
becomes rock .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#48:1>
The underwater environment is quite different from that described
above .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#49:1>
There are fewer hard corals but more fishes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#50:1>
Some of them are the bigger predatory species .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#51:1>
In winter and spring , this is the place to see large communities of
marine algae .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#52:1>
The dominating ones are the <it> <foreign> Sargassum </foreign> </it>
species .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#53:1>
Their abundance is more than those in Tai Chau .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#54:1>
It is fun to wander around this underwater jungle .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#55:1>
Besides the large sargassum algae , you can find some smaller brown
and green algae as well .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#56:1>
Just like jungles on land , a lot of small animals make their homes
here: snails , cardinal fishes , shrimps , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#57:1>
Some divers with keen eyes even find a rare skeleton shrimp .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#58:1>
As they are very small and quite transparent , it is very difficult
to spot them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#59:1>

As Tung Ping Chau is getting popular , more people are visiting
this wonderful island on weekends and public holidays .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#62:1>
More people mean more business opportunities .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#63:1>
Eco-tours are organized every week , not only on land but also in the
sea .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#64:1>
During summer time , there are many snorkellers floating on the sea
surface &obrack;  yes , float please , don't step on the corals! &cbrack; and enjoying the
clear water and rich coral communities of Tung Ping Cahu .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#65:1>
Some people even organize snorkelling courses and one-day scuba
diving experience courses there .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#66:1>
For the sake of safety , it is important to check whether these "
instructors &rdquo; have really acquired the internationally recognized
diving instructor rating . Take NAUI &obrack;  one of the main diving certifying
agents in the world &cbrack; as an example , their assistant instructors and dive
masters are not qualified to teach any diving or snorkelling course .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#67:1>
Besides , the ratio of instructor to candidates of these courses
should be as small as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#68:1>
Personally , I would recommend the maximum ratio of one to two , i.e.
, one instructor with two candidates at any one time in the water . </p> <O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#70:1>
Recently , the quality of the guides of some commercial eco-tour
organizers in Hong Kong has raised a lot of criticism from green groups and
scholars .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#71:1>
Some of them use amplifiers during bird watching tours; collect
flowers and fruits of plants , live shellfish , sea urchins , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#72:1>
They set bad examples for their customers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#73:1>
Moreover , because of limited training and knowledge , much of the
information they provide to their customers is actually wrong .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#74:1>
Be a smart eco-tourist - choose reputated organizers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#75:1>
Otherwise , eco-tours may become destination tours ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#81:2>
Vegetation at <indig> Ngau Ngak Shan </indig> is dense and
greatly varied , thus breeding a lot or rare butterfly species .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#82:2>
That  ' s why it is a paradise for butterfly lovers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#83:2>
In order to reach <indig> Ngau Ngak Shan </indig> and the other
nearby mountains around , you need to go to the barbecue site at the Ma On
Shan Country Park by taxi .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#84:2>
Beside the washroom you can see a staircase which is still under
construction .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#85:2>
Walk up the stairs and you will reach the top of the <indig> Ngau
Ngak Shan </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#86:2>
As the walk is a strenuous one , we suggest you do not bring too many
heavy equipment with you .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#87:2>
A telephoto lens is probably enough . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#88:2>
After reaching <indig> Tin Shau Ngam </indig> , you can take a
rest before you proceed .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#89:2>
Since most butterflies like to colonize at the hilltop , not many
butterflies will be seen along your way .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#90:2>
Usually the higher the mountain is , the more butterflies that can be
found . Pay special attention to the Oak trees beside the path .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#91:2>
Probably you can find the beautiful and rare .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#92:2>
Burmese Bush Blue &obrack;  <it> Arhopala birmana </it>  &cbrack; somewhere around
the trees , as these butterflies are especially active during autumns .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#93:2>
Their wings glitter with metallic violet blue , while the underside
of the wings is adorned with some marble-like patterns .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#94:2>
All these make the Burmese Blue Bush a fascinating creature to watch .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#95:2>
However , they are rather sensitive to any disturbance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#96:2>
That  ' s why you have to be more patient when searching for and
observing this species . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#97:2>
When you look down from the upper part of the hill , you can
easily find several white butterflies flying around the slope .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#98:2>
There are three types of larger butterflies , including Great Orange
Tip &obrack;  <it> Herbomoia glaucippe </it>  &cbrack; , Spotted Sawtooth &obrack;  <it> Prioneris
thestylis </it>  &cbrack; and Painted Jezebel &obrack;  <it> Delias hyparete </it>  &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#99:2>
They look especially graceful with the slope of greenery , as the
background .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#100:2>
It is rather difficult to snap a shot of them , unless they stop for
a while for some nectar . </p> <O> Chinese translation and a photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#104:2>
After reaching the hilltop , you will probably spend a long
period of time there .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#105:2>
Since the butterflies reside at the hilltop , they will not fly away
but dance around you .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#106:2>
Here surely you can find some mountain residents , like Indian
Fritillary &obrack;  <it> Argyreus hyperbius </it>  &cbrack; Danaid Egg-fly &obrack;  <it> Hypolimnis
missippus </it>  &cbrack; and Common Mine &obrack;  <it> Chilasa clytia </it>  &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#107:2>
If you are lucky enough , you might find a species that occurs at
<indig> Ngau Ngak shan </indig> , Orange Staff Sergeant &obrack;  <it> Athyma cama
</it>  &cbrack; , which is a very rare species .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#108:2>
They usually occur at the lower part of the peak , at the canopy of
the trees .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#109:2>
At this time , a telephoto lens would be most helpful for you to
photograph them .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#110:2>
Besides , the rare species that normally do not stop for long ,
Glassy Bluebottle &obrack;  <it> Graphium cloanthus </it>  &cbrack; , can easily be found
motionless and posturing in front of your lens at <indig> Ngau Ngak Shan
</indig> .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#111:2>
It is always an enjoyable experience to watch the Glassy Bluebottle
dancing in the air with their translucent wings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#114:3>
'Footprint &rdquo; is an organization of a group of enthusiastic
university students towards nature and environmental protection , majority of
whom are students or graduates from the Chinese University of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#115:3>
We mainly serve primary and secondary schools , and hope to evoke
interest in concerning ecological footprint , global environmental protection
and poverty among the students through activities like seminars , and
interest classes . </p> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#117:3>
<bold> S </bold> entimental eco-tourism is the way of tourism
that Footprint encourages .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#118:3>
Only with passion for nature could we appreciate what it offers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#119:3>
If we do not even spare a minute to observe the little creatures
around us and listen to the song from nature , how could our affection for
nature be evolved ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#120:3>
Even from a single piece of shed leaf , you can see the veins
running in complicated crisscross pattern .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#121:3>
How can you be hardhearted towards such a miraculous life ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#122:3>
According to Confucius , only understanding something is no
better than loving or enjoying it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#123:3>
Therefore we now know that evolving affection for nature is more
important than just understanding it .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#124:3>
Besides , according to another famous ancient Chinese poet , we
should be relaxed when journeying through the wilderness .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#125:3>
These tell us that a rush eco-tour with too much to learn might
simply hinder us from experiencing the nature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#126:3>
The scopes of this course &ldquo; Getting close to the nature
&rdquo; range from small to large .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#127:3>
From a grass or flower to a forest or desert , all of them are
valuable materials for teaching .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#128:3>
What is important is &ldquo; Direct Experience" , in addition , the
most important of all are &ldquo; Unintentional Absorption &rdquo; and
&ldquo; Learning without examination" .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#129:3>
&ldquo; Unconscious Influence &rdquo; is the process in which our
heart gets more condensed and free , prompted by the gradual accumulation of
beauty experience in time and space . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#130:3>
The renowned environmental educationist Joseph Cornell proposed
&ldquo; Flowering Learning &rdquo; method in the wild , it includes the
following four steps: <bold> <it> Stage 1 - Awakening Enthusiasm: </it>
</bold> The first thing is to awake everyone  ' s interest and sensitivity
towards the environment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#131:3>
<bold> <it> Stage 2 - Be concentrated: </it> </bold> Learning
depends on concentration .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#132:3>
Try to focus your enthusiasm towards nature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#133:3>
<bold> <it> Stage 3 - Experience yourself: </it> </bold> Once
concentrated , your sensitivity of vision , hearing and smell becomes acute ,
thus able to sense your surroundings more clearly .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#134:3>
Only with concentration can you immerse yourself into the harmony
and rhythm of the nature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#135:3>
<bold> <it> Stage 4 - Experience sharing: </it> </bold>
Experiencing the internal consciousness , you may gain immense joy or the
in-depth , harmonious happiness , or the extra-ordinary beauty of nature or
the mystery of life creation .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#136:3>
If you are in peace , you can easily be inspired by nature in
various aspects . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-017#137:3>
The renowned scientist Dr . Lau from the Chinese Academy of
Science also defines the science ecology as &ldquo; a science full of love" .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#138:3>
The experts agree that feeling the nature is the main theme of
eco-tourism: Feel the harmonious atmosphere from nature while embraced by the
huge ocean and sky .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#139:3>
You would recognize man is in fact nothing compared to the immense
universe .

<ICE-HK:W2D-017#140:3>
With a humble view like that , one would certainly pay respect for
the nature . </p>
