Welcome to this presentation

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#2:1:A>
Uh here today I will give you a brief introduction on the products
on the company profile uh Jardine information system and Hong Kong Informix

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#3:1:A>
Uh <,,> are you ready <,> ok

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#4:1:A>
Uh today you know uh we have a few products from the Hong Kong
Informix <,> is the Informix SQL <,> Informix uh FourGL and many other tools
front-end tools back-end tools and many other kinds of products <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#5:1:A>
Uh first of all I  ' ll give you an introduction on the company
profile <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#6:1:A>
Uh Jardine Information System

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#7:1:A>
Jardine Information System is the a division under Jardine Office
System uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#8:1:A>
The main target of the the main goal of the Jardine Information
System is to uh as a is a as a distributor to give you uh a service back-up
and set you a products informix <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#9:1:A>
Informix is a database product is ah is give you a <.> th ah </.>
solution for you to dissolve the problems in relational database

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#10:1:A>
Uh <?> relational database </?> as you may know then is uh is a
kind of uh <.> data </.> information management concept

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#11:1:A>
Uh it helps you to uh develop your application base on some rules
of relational database

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#12:1:A>
Actually <?> this development </?> is a set of tables

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#13:1:A>
A table is a kind of a for example is a kind of files are contains
of a set of records

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#14:1:A>
This records contains of uh another set of fields and then
information are uh would gather in this kind of uh this kind of format <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#15:1:A>
Hong Kong Informix

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#16:1:A>
Hong Kong Informix <?> is </?> uh your you mainly give us our
technical support and informations uh information brochure or some kinds of
service support <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#17:1:A>
Then the main uh <.> t </.> the main support is given by us by
Jardine Information System

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#18:1:A>
We  ' ll give you uh a service backup or maintenance or training or
any kinds of technical support <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#19:1:A>
Now uh we will go back to the <.> sys </.> uh to the product
profile <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#20:1:A>
Informix <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#21:1:A>
There is two kinds two kinds of products in Informix product family

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#22:1:A>
The first one is the front-end tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#23:1:A>
The front-end tools is the for example is uh Informix SQL Informix
FourGL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#24:1:A>
Uh front-end just means uh the application tools the software
products that will interact <.> direct </.> directly with the user with the
end user

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#25:1:A>
Uh they will not handle they will not handle the real physical <.>
reaphys </.> real and physical uh data match <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#26:1:A>
And the <.> an </.> another kinds of product is the back-end tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#27:1:A>
The back-end tools works is the it is the tools to directly access
the database access the hardware the hard disk and the communication between
between the two <unc> one-word </unc> is very important

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#28:1:A>
Uh because uh as we have some kinds of operation from the end user
<,> uh we will have to we have to uhm make uh <.> a </.> a uh connection
between the front-end tools and the back-end tools <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#29:1:A>
The uh as we make the operations valid and then I will send you a
message send a call to the uh to the back-end tools and the and the back-end
tools <?> is </?> the database engine

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#30:1:A>
The database engine will process the data uh directly with your
hard disk make some uh transactions and then we  ' ll make the result back to
the front-end tools and user can in this kind of format they can uh access
the data in the remote site <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#31:1:A>
This kind of uh operation we can uh we can <.> ss uh s </.> called
a client server model or uh or <.> s </.> or two process architecture <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#32:1:A>
Front-end tools <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#33:1:A>
Actually we have a several kinds of <.> front en </.> front-end
tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#34:1:A>
The first one is <.> s </.> ISQL we call it uh Informix SQL

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#35:1:A>
Uh Informix <.> s </.> SQL stands for you know uh <.> some </.>
somebody may know is the uh structural query language

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#36:1:A>
Uh it  ' s a language <.> de </.> uh derive from the ANSI uh ANSI
standard

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#37:1:A>
ANSI standard stands for A N S I American National uh Standards
Institute

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#38:1:A>
It gives you a standard in the relational database and we give the
uh we and we can uh use this uh this kind of standard and develop our
standard we call it Informix SQL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#39:1:A>
Informix SQL is actually a front-end tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#40:1:A>
The <.> se </.> second one is the uh the Informix FourGL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#41:1:A>
Informix FourGL is the another product that is the program and
environment for you to develop your program with FourGL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#42:1:A>
FourGL means uh stands for fourth generation language <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#43:1:A>
Fourth generation language is the is the new language a new
generation language different from the third generation

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#44:1:A>
The third <.> genera </.> third generation languages > ? > were
known as </?> C or Pascal it  ' s a kind of language

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#45:1:A>
It gives you uh many flexibility <,> on various purpose

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#46:1:A>
Various purpose uh for you to develop to uh your own application
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#47:1:A>
But for the fourth generation language <,> is mainly its main goal
is to develop your application of uh database <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#48:1:A>
It deal much uh much work in database but not other kinds of uh of
applications and that is the Fourth Generation Language <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#49:1:A>
And the and there  ' s another front-end users the ESQL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#50:1:A>
ESQL is the embedded SQL with C <,> is that that means that you can
you can write uh computer language uh with SQL and third <.> languag </.>
third generation language C together

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#51:1:A>
And two languages can be combined into a single language <,> and
then we call it ESQLC

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#52:1:A>
It <.> giv </.> it gives you a great flexibility in programming
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#53:1:A>
And generally we can have this kind of uh front-end tools <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#54:1:A>
The back-end tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#55:1:A>
The back-end tools is uh divided into two <?> processes </?>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#56:1:A>
Uh back-end tools uh is actually is actually uh is a either a <.>
data </.> online database engine or standard engine <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#57:1:A>
Standard engine will give you a uh give you a easy of use uh
product

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#58:1:A>
Actually it will gives you an little management uh database engine
because for the standard engine you you need not uh care about much uh much
thing that are so <.> certif </.> certificate or uh most of the complicated
work are eliminated

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#59:1:A>
Uh but for the online engine <,> you you need to uh you need to
tackle with many technical problems because uh it will contain many uh
operation system concept

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#60:1:A>
For example uh you you have to manage a hard disk with the online
engine <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#61:1:A>
Uh you have to manage your memory <,> and other tools in the in the
in the operating system or hardware <,> and this kind of <unc> one-word
</unc> will be handled in the online engine but not in the standard
engine

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#62:1:A>
Standard engine will not handle this kind of operations <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#63:1:A>
But how about the uh how about <.> a a </.> how about the standard
engine and if if it cannot handle this kind of uh operating system or it
cannot adapt to only uh uh platform configuration <,> uh because the online
engine the online engine is the is the engine <?> which </?> will give you a
uh all availability <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#64:1:A>
That means the you the the <.> availa </.> the high availability
will give you for example uh seven seven days in the week and twenty-four
hours a day uh service

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#65:1:A>
Then the online engine will not be down will not will <.> n n </.>
will not down uh in any aspect even though even though the hard disk is
crashed or the power is down <,> and the online engine can can have a
recovery process such that even the hardware uh has some uh any difficulties
to operation and or or or there  ' s any the power power insufficiency and then
the online engine can handle this kind of problems uh that so that the data
in the database in the <unc> 1-word </unc> engine will not be
corrupted

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#66:1:A>
But for the standard engine <,> there will have little little uh
little tools for you to uh handle this kind of problem is for example the
power down or the disk crash <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#67:1:A>
This  ' s the difference between the online engine and the standard
engine

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#68:1:A>
Now uh in the following sections I will give you a more details in
this kind of products and how they interact with each other <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#69:1:A>
First of all is Informix SQL

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#70:1:A>
Informix SQL is actually uh is actually a uh user environment for
you to developing your full your full applications in database <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#71:1:A>
In the Informix SQL there are five built-in tools

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#72:1:A>
The first one is <,> Form Form Writer <,> Form Writer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#73:1:A>
The second is <,> Report Writer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#74:1:A>
And then <,> it  ' s interactive <.> t s </.> SQL Editor Interactive
SQL editor <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#75:1:A>
And finally there is a Interactive Schema Editor <,,> Schema Editor
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#76:1:A>
And <,,> okay Form Writer

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#77:1:A>
Form Writer is actually is uh is just for you to build your scheme
form

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#78:1:A>
The scheme form actually is a is a is a format for you to uh manage
your database on the screen on the on the screen <.> tha u </.> that will
give you for example <.> wil </.> uh uh we will use the term what you see is
what you get that means uh whatever you write in the form classifications
there will be uh the same exact format you will see on the screen

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#79:1:A>
<?> That  ' s </?> the Form Form Writer

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#80:1:A>
The Form Writer will give you uh the tools for you to uh <.> wr
</.> write your form the screen form in a form specifications

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#81:1:A>
A form <.> specifica </.> <?> specifications </?> specify which
kind of operations can uh will be valid in the in the form field <,> in the
form field

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#82:1:A>
There are there are the four operations uh in the Form Writer

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#83:1:A>
The first one is uh Query <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#84:1:A>
Update <,> delete <,> add <,,> this kind of operation is uh are
usually used in uh in usual in usual operations in the database is to add a
record delete a record or carry a find a record from the database

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#85:1:A>
This kind of operations are are the most most likely used in the
database operations and then you  ' ll give the the Form Writer will give this
kind of operations valid for you to operate <?> on </?> the database <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#86:1:A>
The second one is Report Writer

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#87:1:A>
Report writer tool gives you a uh great flexibility in writing a
report

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#88:1:A>
The report can be for example <?> a </?> name list or label or some
kinds of format some kind of format that will give you a column table format
report <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#89:1:A>
The Report Writer uh is the uh is <?> very like </?> that with the
Form Form Writer because the Report Writer can uh can give you a uh also a
<?> use </?> the Report Writer will use uh also uh a <.> for </.> a report
specification

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#90:1:A>
After you specify your report specifications you the Report Writer
can generate automatically uh the report the report uh format that you want
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#91:1:A>
Uh sometimes the report may involve a calculation for example uh
after you write a report you there will a subtotal or or some average and
some some fields or some columns and then the Report Writer will
automatically generate this kind of calculation no matter no matter uh uh
what kind of data is uh uh inside the database

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#92:1:A>
Because sometimes the database will change from the time to time
and then the Report Writer need not to regenerate need not to be regenerated
and the order report to you can be valid even you have changed the database
content and the Report Writer will generate a report format such that the
report format can be used uh even your data can uh have been changed and that  ' s
the flexibility of the Report Writer <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#93:1:A>
The first one in the third one is the Interactive Interactive SQL
Editor

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#94:1:A>
Actually you can write some SQL statements

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#95:1:A>
SQL statements is the format defined in the ANSI standard ANSI
standard SQL <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#96:1:A>
And the Interactive SQL <.> states </.> SQL <?> ss </?> Editor will
<.> a </.> allow you to uh write some SQL statements and run the SQL
statements because uh after you write the SQL statements the machine will not
know what you want what you want that what you want to do and then the Editor
will help you to run the SQL statement

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#97:1:A>
For example there are several uh SQL statements we will usually use

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#98:1:A>
The first one is Select Select Statement

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#99:1:A>
Select Statement is the kind of operation we want to uh for example
<?> if you </?> want to uh get some information from the database for example
I want to select the customer number <,> customer name customer address from
the database table customer from the customer table and then the <unc>
one-word </unc> after you run the operation uh the scheme will give you
the results and the database will give you uh the full set of uh information
you specify company name company uh the customer name customer number in the
format in the format you specify

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#100:1:A>
But there  ' s difference between the Report Writer and this kind of
Select Statement <,> because uh the Select Statement will not format will not
format your your output

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#101:1:A>
It just gives you the output gives you the output
only will not format <.> wil </.> uh the output but for the uh Report Writer
it  ' ll give you the format

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#102:1:A>
For example you want the customer <.> na </.>
name uh positioned at the the at the <.> th </.> some specific place or you
want your address uh <?> display </?> in some format

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#103:1:A>
And then the Report Writer will help you to do this kind of
formatting but for the Select Statement it will give it  ' ll <.> giv </.> give
you information only and <.> t </.> no formatting uh will be derived

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#104:1:A>
And there are many other kinds of SQL statement for example is
Insert or Delete uh this <?> kind of operation </?> will help you to insert
uh a record to the database table or delete it from the database table

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#105:1:A>
This kind of operation will be will be will be used oftenly in the
SQL Editor

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#106:1:A>
And there are many other kinds of tools that that are not defined
in the in the ANSI system SQL and then it will it will also uh <.> u </.> it
you can also use this kind of uh SQL statement uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#107:1:A>
We we had better call it uh Utility

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#108:1:A>
Actually it  ' s not a <.> s </.> SQL Statement

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#109:1:A>
This kind of Utility uh this is a utility unique to uh Informix

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#110:1:A>
And uh other kinds of uh <.> s </.> uh database software will not
contain this kind of uh operations for example is load and unload l o a d

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#111:1:A>
It will <?> you </?> can load the data from the <.> t </.> the
external <.> date </.> external file for example is SQ file or some kind of
uh external format and you can use this kind of utilities to uh load your
data and and and of course uh there are many other kinds of uh utilities <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#112:1:A>
<?> These </?> are the functions of the Informix uh Informix
<unc> 1-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#113:1:A>
And the fourth one is the the Interactive Schema Editor <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#114:1:A>
Informix Schema Editor is actually <,> is actually uh <,,> an
editor for you to design your database structures design your uh table
structure table definitions because in this table it is a kind of uh
information for example I have uh customer data customer table <,> for
example I have a customer table

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#115:1:A>
A customer table will contain the information <,> uh customer
number <,> customer name <,> customer address customer telephone number <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#116:1:A>
And you can uh <.> spec </.> you must specify <?> each </?> group
one by one with exact data type <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#117:1:A>
For example you must specify your your customer number as as a
character type <,> your customer name as character type <,> uh address as
character type of ten character <,> or telephone number as uh an integer and
then you have to specify which <.> kin </.> which kind of data uh for each
field it will be

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#118:1:A>
And you have to define this kind of uh table definitions <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#119:1:A>
Uh this kind of definitions uh can be written can be written in
SQL statement <,> as well as you can uh define this kind of definitions with
the Interactive SQL Schema Editor

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#120:1:A>
The Schema Editor will help you to define this kind of table
definitions <,> uh in the format uh you just fill in the blanks <?> just </?>
fill in the blanks uh one by one <,> and then <,> you will see the table
structure defined <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-059#121:1:A>
That  ' s the <.> flexi </.> that  ' s the convenience for you to uh
<.> de </.> uh develop your application </I>
