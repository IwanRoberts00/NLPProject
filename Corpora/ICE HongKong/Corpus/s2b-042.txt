<ICE-HK:S2B-042#1:1:A>
Good afternoon everybody <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#2:1:A>
Welcome to my presentation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#3:1:A>
Today I  ' m going to present as the title suggests Dimensions of the
Chinese Person Perception <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#4:1:A>
First of all I will talk about the reasons for carrying out this
research <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#5:1:A>
Secondly <,> I will tell you about how the research was conducted
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#6:1:A>
Then it is followed by some results discussion as well as some
future research directions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#7:1:A>
First of all <,> why this research is carried out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#8:1:A>
First of all I want to tell how many dimensions of person perception
do Hong Kong Chinese use <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#9:1:A>
That means how do Hong Kong Chinese use the the factors the
personality perception factor to describe somebody <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#10:1:A>
Second <,> do indigenous measures produce the same results as the
imported measures <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#11:1:A>
That is <,> uh what  ' s the relationship between the instrument that
is imported from the West <,> and the instrument that is developed locally or
by some Chinese psychologists <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#12:1:A>
Then this is followed by does a culturally balanced scale produce
different or better results than those previous measure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#13:1:A>
That is the indigenous and the imported <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#14:1:A>
Now it comes to how the research was conducted <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#15:1:A>
First of all I will factor analyze two sets of representative
descriptives <,> and as I told you before one is indigenous in nature that is
we call out this items from some Chinese psychologists <.> whi </.> uh who
developed the items locally

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#16:1:A>
And the other is imported I mean other instrument is imported in
nature

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#17:1:A>
That is we translate the instrument from the West

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#18:1:A>
And then after the factor analyses we obtain or we select salient
descriptives <,> that is uh representative of each of the factors

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#19:1:A>
And uhm uh I  ' ll use secondly I  ' ll use both indigenous and
imported items with the same subjects

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#20:1:A>
That is I skim I mean I gleaned the salient description from the
indigenous and the imported instruments and then mix them up in the
questionnaire and then ask the same subject to fill them in

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#21:1:A>
And in in that way the relationship between these two sets of items
can be studied by means of multiple regression economical correlation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#22:1:A>
And thirdly I  ' ll regress each set of scale that is indigenous and
imported against some real life criterion variables which were requested from
the same subjects <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#23:1:A>
And then finally I  ' ll repeat the procedure C that is <,> to
regress the scale against some criterion variables

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#24:1:A>
But this time I  ' m using some a culturally balance scale which I  ' ll
explain afterwards

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#25:1:A>
And then in this way the relative effectiveness of the three sets
of scale that is indigenous imported and the culturally balanced scale in
explaining the criterion variable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#26:1:A>
And uh now I  ' ll talk about that is what have I used in the study
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#27:1:A>
They are the natural language traits lexicons that is as the source
of the descriptives in use

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#28:1:A>
I use it because people very often use them natural language to
describe somebody as a personality description questionnaire

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#29:1:A>
I think we have the responsibility to include these because it  ' s
<.> be </.> rather useful by the people to use it in the daily life <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#30:1:A>
And then what  ' s the result

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#31:1:A>
That is number four American using English Dutch using Dutch
Germans using German <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#32:1:A>
That is for the big five dimension which is well-establish in the
West

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#33:1:A>
People from from uh Holland people from Germany they also I mean
they under their research they also discover these five dimensions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#34:1:A>
But for long for the last factor that is some people will describe
it as culture somebody will describe it as intellect they and some more more
some people will describe it as openness to experience <,> because of the
nature of <?> their </?> factors

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#35:1:A>
But then in my studies that of I mean giving an accurate or correct
answers for we why should <?> or </?> we what should call for the last factor
I  ' ll include the big five dimensions plus the openness to experience
dimension to let the subject rate it and then factor analyze to see how the
factor uhm I mean the fifth factor or the sixth factor should be named

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#36:1:A>
So totally I will include six scales in my first study

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#37:1:A>
That is extroversion agreeableness conscientiousness neuroticism
culture and openness to experience <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#38:1:A>
And then for here I  ' d like to thank <?> Luke </?> Goldberg for
providing me the big five trait measures

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#39:1:A>
And also I  ' ll thank Jeff <?> McCrae </?> for providing me the
openness to experience trait measure so that my study can be carried out

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#40:1:A>
And as the factor analysis result pointed out I discover six factor
which is really has a clear correspondence to the big five plus the openness
to experience in the West

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#41:1:A>
Okay secondly I  ' ll report on the Chinese I mean the indigenous to
how is the factor how are the factor I mean what factors are discovered in
this study <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#42:1:A>
In nineteen seventy-three Yen and <?> Lee </?> called it an amount
of uh more than five hundred personality descriptives

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#43:1:A>
And then in nineteen eighty-five Yen and Bond choose some uh one
hundred and fifty and then let the subject do and then factor analyze it

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#44:1:A>
And then <.> fro </.> from the factor analysis table <,> I get out
some of the salient or important ones <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#45:1:A>
And then for William Liu in nineteen eighty-five also he he
included some items in his scale for saying that oh for the he  ' ll add some
item which is in compensation for Yen and Bond nineteen eighty-one for
example like concern about face nationalism something like that

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#46:1:A>
And then from Yen and Bond nineteen eighty-five and from Liu
nineteen eighty-five I try to call out some I mean glean out some salient
description

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#47:1:A>
That is who has the a high factor loading in each factor
respectively

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#48:1:A>
And then mix them up and then include it in a questionnaire and let
the subject do <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#49:1:A>
So what  ' s the result <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#50:1:A>
I discover two four six six Chinese dimensions of Chinese
perception <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#51:1:A>
The first one is dominance <,> social certainty <,> expressiveness
<,> educated morality <,> neuroticism <,> and finally heterosexual interest
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#52:1:A>
And the and this is the I mean the six dimension by our that I uh
discovered from an indigenous instrument <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#53:1:A>
So <.> af </.> after that I am going to tell about how do I create
the complements that is the culturally balanced scale

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#54:1:A>
How do I do it

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#55:1:A>
First of all I  ' ll select four to eight exemplars with high factor
loading that is around point four o or above form the twelve factor which
come form the indigenous and imported instrument

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#56:1:A>
That is six from each of the instrument

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#57:1:A>
And then I  ' ll let the subject do I mean filled in the ratings plus
some personal information for example their academic performance <,> and uh
uh degree of westernization <,> leadership friendship <?> latent </?>
etcetera etcetera <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#58:1:A>
Then the next step is to factor analyze the resulting pool of items
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#59:1:A>
The result is as follow

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#60:1:A>
I extracted eight factor with acceptably high combat alpha

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#61:1:A>
The eight factors are emotional stability <,> extroversion <,>
application openness to experience <,> assertiveness <,> restraint <,>
helpfulness <,> and intellect

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#62:1:A>
So the next is concerning are the factors from the indigenous and
imported instrument

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#63:1:A>
Are they the same or what  ' s the relationship between the six
factors from each of the instrument <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#64:1:A>
As you can see from the figure the relationship among the imported
factor and the indigenous factors <?> are </?> mixed

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#65:1:A>
<?> With </?> as you can have a look on the R square the highest is
sixty-six

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#66:1:A>
That is the indigenous factor of expressiveness is explained by the
imported extroversion <,> emotional stability and openness

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#67:1:A>
And the lowest R square is ten percent which is represented
indigenous heterosexual interest is explained by extroversion only <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#68:1:A>
And this is so-called the the relationship among the imported and
the indigenous factors

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#69:1:A>
Finally we  ' ll talking about how well do the predicted variable
that is the three sets of scale that is indigenous <,> imported and as
culturally balance scale in explain the target the criterion variable

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#70:1:A>
That is the one that I describe to you before <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#71:1:A>
As you can have a look <,> this one represented the imported IMP
imported scale and then indigenous

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#72:1:A>
This is followed by SA

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#73:1:A>
SA is the culturally balanced scale

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#74:1:A>
That is the eight dimension

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#75:1:A>
As you can see none of the scale none of the set none set no set of
scale is I mean very powerful in explaining the criterion variables <,>
except it for the indigenous scale

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#76:1:A>
They account for twenty-two percent <,> I mean they explain twenty
<.> perce </.> twenty-two percent of the variance for the degree of
westernization with the rest <?> for </?> from the fewest to zero one per
cent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#77:1:A>
That is one percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#78:1:A>
And uhm <,> for this as you can have a look on table three

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#79:1:A>
It is self-explanatory <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#80:1:A>
So what  ' s the conclusion <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#81:1:A>
For long in nineteen ninety in nineteen ninety Yen and Bond explain
they try to explore the relationship between the indigenous and the imported
scales <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#82:1:A>
And uh it is supposed that the indigenous scale can take the
individual differences more fully because it  ' s develop locally I mean it  ' s
indigenous in nature

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#83:1:A>
And for at at present study we do replicate this problem and I mean
replicate the study and then see what  ' s the relationship between the
indigenous and <.> ex </.> the imported scale

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#84:1:A>
As you can see it  ' s like a mixed picture with the lowest ten
percent of R square and with the highest sixty-six percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#85:1:A>
And then finally when you have a look on the table we hope that
maybe even for the indigenous they do not account for more variance in the
criterion variable

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#86:1:A>
Maybe the culturally balanced one is better because the <.> cons
</.> the scale consists of items I mean the salient item form imported and
indigenous

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#87:1:A>
And it is hoped that it can take the full range of individual
differences in the Chinese culture <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#88:1:A>
But nonetheless I mean <,> if replicated with other criterion
variable and other samples the present results would challenge the <?>
investment </?> required to develop local instrumentation on scientific <?>
brands </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#89:1:A>
And this the end of my presentation

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#90:1:A>
And it  ' s the time for me to entertain some of your questions <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#91:1:A>
Thank you </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#92:2:A>
Good morning <,> Mr Chan <,> lady and gentlemen <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#93:2:A>
It is my pleasure <,> to take this opportunity today <,> to say a
few word at the opening of <,> this conference <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#94:2:A>
As Hong Kong  ' s <,> largest employer and exporter earner <,> the
clothing industry makes an <?> indispensable </?> contribution to the economy
<,> and there  ' s no doubt that our <,> clothing manufacture have done well
<,> to have maintained their position

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#95:2:A>
However <,> a growing awareness that our original labours are
acting their way into stronger competitive position have brought changes <,>
and inevitably there will be more <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#96:2:A>
Some companies <,> are opting to have to move part of their
operation to low-cost area in the region <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#97:2:A>
Other are adjusting their production method to rise their
productivity level whichever route or combination of option a company choose

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#98:2:A>
A common concern is surfacing among this intent on staying ahead of
the competition

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#99:2:A>
They decide to improve their value-added performance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#100:2:A>
Investigating the application of information technology the
subject of this conference <,> is a positive step towards a higher
value-added mode of the production <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#101:2:A>
And ninety some technology is not industry specific <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#102:2:A>
However with the new software application being developed all the
time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#103:2:A>
It  ' s particularly useful to focus upon example problems and
solutions provided by those who are expert in the field <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#104:2:A>
We are very fortune <,> to have with us today and tomorrow <,>
number of experts in this field <,> besides company directors and academics
familiar with the local scenes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#105:2:A>
Severals oversea guests has been invited to bring us their
perspective on a variety of issues related to the <,> subject <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#106:2:A>
I would like to express my appreciation to both Hong Kong
Productivity Council and the Clothing Institute Clothing and Footwear
Institute for their joint effort in organizing this event <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#107:2:A>
I hope all our participants will be able to share the experience
and technical expertise of our prominent speaker in today and tomorrow
presentation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#108:2:A>
Without further ado I declare the Clothing Industry Convention
ninety-two open <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#109:2:A>
Thank you </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-042#110:3:A>
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#111:3:A>
as the Clothing Industry Conference draws to a close <,> I wish to
thank the speakers <,> and all who attended <,> for making this year  ' s forum
such a worthwhile experience <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#112:3:A>
On behalf of the organizers <,> I would also like to express our
gratitude <,> to the five sponsoring organizations <,> for their past and
continuing support <,> namely the Federation of Hong Kong Garment
Manufacturers <,> Hong Kong Garment Manufacturer Association <,> Hong Kong
Knitwear Exporter and Manufacturing Association Limited <,> Hong Kong Woollen
and Synthetic Knitters Knitting Manufacturers Association Limited <,> and the
Textile Council of Hong Kong Limited <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#113:3:A>
This conference as implied by its theme A New Horizon in the
Clothing Industry <,> was intended to give participants a new insight <,> to
enhance their <,> understanding of the users of information technology <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#114:3:A>
The application of information technology in the clothing industry
<,> are diverse and varied <,> and it is impossible to cover all the options
in two days <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#115:3:A>
However <,> it is our aim that the conference programme <,> would
be able to provide some solutions <,> or inspirations to participants <,> in
the area of technology <,> management quality <,> and productivity
enhancement <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#116:3:A>
As organizers both Hong Kong Productivity Council and the Clothing
and Footwear Institute will be delighted to hear your comments <,> and
feedback is always appreciated and helpful in planning future events <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#117:3:A>
Also as the government  ' s uh principle technology transfer agent
<,> the Hong Kong Productivity Council will be happy to assist the clothing
industry should manufacturers <,> require related information or consultancy
advisors <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#118:3:A>
Their consultancy staff come from a wide range of science and
business backgrounds <,> and they take an integral integrated approach to
cater to the needs of their clients <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#119:3:A>
Many small and medium size <,> enterprises in Hong Kong have
benefitted from their <.> indu </.> industrial support services <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#120:3:A>
As Hong Kong  ' s garment industry move further into the phase of
value added manufacturing <,> it will need to become more innovative <,> and
skillful in the area of design <,> sourcing <,> marketing and so forth

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#121:3:A>
As discussed earlier in the conference presentations information
technology can be applied to these activities <,> for improved productivity
and quality <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#122:3:A>
It is now it is now up to individual participants to pursue the
options and implement changes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-042#123:3:A>
Thank you </I>
