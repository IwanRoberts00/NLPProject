The map for Chinese-Western comparative drama study can be charted
out from the area pertaining to Chinese-Western comparative literature study .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#4:1>
In other words , it may generally be assumed that methods and
practices apropos the former study may not be dissimilar to those apropos the
latter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#5:1>
Bearing in mind theatre  ' s mediumistic exigencies , which call for
special treatment and investigation , one could perhaps propose that
Chinese-Western comparative study , as dramatic literature study , may well
proceed with the follow steps : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#6:1>
Influence Studies :

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#7:1>
This method has often centred on influences between Chinese and
Western playwrights , reception and comparison of works , directing , acting
system or theatre theories , Chinese and Western .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#8:1>
Examples can be found in studies on Stanislavski  ' s Method system on
modern Chinese theatre or on the applicability of Stanislavski  ' s Method in
traditional Peking opera , the impact of Chinese style of acting on Bertolt
Brecht  ' s dramaturgy or even the latter  ' s reverse influence on contemporary
Chinese theatre , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#9:1>
Studies characterized by this method are quite numerous .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#10:1>
They could cover as wide a range of contents as Eugene O'Neill and
Taoism &obrack; <it> Chung-wai Literary Monthly </it> , Vol. 7 , No.7
&cbrack; , Strindberg and his oriental outlook &obrack; <it> Chung-wai
Literary Monthly </it> , Vol. 13 , No. 6 &cbrack; , Brecht  ' s Epic Theatre
and traditional Chinese theatre &obrack; <it> Ming Pao Monthly </it> , Feb .
1981 &cbrack; , Ts'ao Yu and Chekhovian and O'Neillian influences &obrack;
<it> Ming Pao Monthly </it> , Sept. 1969 &cbrack; , etc. , to name just but a
few . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#11:1>
Parallel and Affinity Studies :

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#12:1>
Methods of study in this category mainly focus on the affinity
between dramatic works which have no <it> <foreign> rapports de fait
</foreign> </it> whatsoever , except stylistic , structural or ideological
resemblances .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#13:1>
These examples can consists in parallel study of plays , Chinese and
European , such as <it> Romeo and Juliet </it> and <it> <foreign> Chiao hung
Chi </foreign> </it> <O> Chinese-characters </O> &obrack; <it> Essays in
Comparative Literature Studies </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#14:1>
Tianjin : Nankai University Press , 1984 &cbrack; , <it> Macbeth
</it> and <it> <foreign> Fa tzu tu </foreign> </it> <O> Chinese-characters
</O> &obrack; <it> Tu shu </it> , 1986.5 &cbrack; , <it> <foreign> Hsi hsiang

<it> Chung-wai Literary Monthly </it> , Vol. 4 , No. 4 &cbrack; , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#15:1>
All in all , these methods could cover the so-called &ldquo;
<foreign> rapports exterieurs </foreign> &rdquo; as well as &ldquo; <foreign>
rapports interieurs </foreign> &rdquo; between Chinese and Western dramatic
works . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#16:1>
Genology Studies :

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#17:1>
Examples of this nature in general borrow Western generic concepts
such as tragedy , comedy or melodrama to study Chinese dramatic works with a
view to shedding some light on the structural , ideological and typological
constructs of Chinese drama .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#18:1>
Perhaps one of the earliest pioneer works is Ch'ien Chung-shu  ' s <O>
Chinese-characters </O> article , &ldquo; Tragedy in Old Chinese Drama
&rdquo; published in <it> T'ien hsia </it> <O> Chinese-characters </O>
magazine in 1935 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#19:1>
More recent examples have run the gamut from Ku T'ian-hung  ' s <O>
Chinese-characters </O> &ldquo; <it> Tou O </it> as Tragedy &rdquo; &obrack;
<it> Chung-wai Literary Monthly </it> , Vol. 4 , No. 8 &cbrack; , Cheung

Tragedy &rdquo; &obrack; <it> Chung-hsi pi-chiao wen-hsueh lun chi </it> .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#22:1>
Though the three kinds of approach pertaining to Chinese-Western
comparative drama can be subsumed in the general parameters of
Chinese-Western comparative literature study , however , we need to pay
attention to the fact that drama study has two sides of a coin , the other
side being drama as theatre , which , as its mediumistic nature entails , has
to be different from literature study after all , be it general or
comparative .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#23:1>
Besides , theatre study or analysis involves performance and
performance has its most essential human dimension , which comes from actors
acting their roles , i.e. , their particular actorly artistry , systems of
performance , and the playwright-director-audience triangle , all of which
form a very complex and multi-level matrix of relationship .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#24:1>
These are matters germane to the theatre as a means of expression ,
and require thus special methods and practices suitable to the theatre to
body forth its expression .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#25:1>
Hence , they should , in accord with its medium , transcend methods
and practices pertaining to general and comparative literature study .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#26:1>
It follows then that a viable and distinct methodology for the
investigation and study of Chinese-Western comparative drama is in order , in
addition to what has already been made available by Chinese-Western
comparative literature study in general . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#27:1>
At this point in time , some initial steps have been taken .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#28:1>
One has seen works addressing themselves to comparing the concept of
theatre in China and the West , Grotowski  ' s Poor Theatre and Chinese theatre
, aesthetic ideals in the system of Brecht , Stanislavski and the Chinese
theatre , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#29:1>
One cannot expect an instant methodology , least of all a poetics .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#30:1>
Certainly , theoretical and methodological fruition needs time to
come to being .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#31:1>
In the future , comparative study on Chinese-Western drama and
theatre will have to be armed with more genre and medium conscious
methodology and practice , which will have been the convergent efforts of
both theatre practitioners and scholars interested in the Chinese-Western
comparative perspective .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#32:1>
Presumably , these efforts will and should concern themselves with
comparing the concept of theatre in China and the West , systems of
performance as well as directing , uses of theatre language and space ,
audience response , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#33:1>
These efforts or endeavours should enhance the viability of
Chinese-Western comparative drama as academic discipline , the research
methods of which embrace yet transcend the scope of mere comparativism and
nominal internationalism , with a view to eventually establishing a
Chinese-Western comparative drama poetics . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#34:1>
In view of this aim , the present collection of essays is a
modest step taken in that direction .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#35:1>
It is , nevertheless , significant and important to note that this is
the first collection of essays in English , devoted to Chinese-Western
comparative drama .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#36:1>
All of the articles were read at the Fourth Hong Kong International
Comparative Literature Conference held in 17-21 August 1987 and sponsored by
the Comparative Literature Research Unit of the English Department of The
Chinese University of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#37:1>
The collection shows a wide range of topics of Chinese-Western
comparative drama interest , and represents to a large extent the general
concern and quality of the conference .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#38:1>
Moreover , it reflects efforts by drama scholars and theatre
practitioners in this rather new territory of research .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#39:1>
By no means does this collection claim to be authoritative or presume
to lay down guidelines or directives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#40:1>
However , it does hope to demonstrate some possibilities in the area
of Chinese-Western comparative drama and serve important informative and
inspirational purposes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#41:1>
The present collection contains fourteen articles , which by
their thematic and methodological nature can be arranged in five categories
for discussion and review .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#42:1>
The articles by Drs. Fong , Sato and Tam are concerned with the
influence and reception of European drama in modern Chinese and Japanese
drama .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#43:1>
Dr. Fong  ' s article , &ldquo; Western Influence and the Rise of
Modern Chinese Drama, &rdquo; offers an appropriate area of investigation for
Chinese-Western comparative drama scholars , analyzing and comparing three
modern Chinese plays , <it> The Greatest Event in Life </it> by Hu Shih ,
<it> Yama Chao </it> by Hung Shen and <it> Wang Chao-chun </it> by Kuo Mo-jo
, with their respective Western prototypes , <it> A Doll  ' s House </it> by
Ibsen , <it> Emperor Jones </it> by O'Neill and <it> Salome </it> by Oscar
Wilde .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#44:1>
Though with only three case studies , the article is a legitimate
attempt at establishing <it> <foreign> rapports de fait </foreign> </it>
between these three sets of plays , shedding light on certain issues about
adaptation and indigenization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#45:1>
Perhaps , one may feel a little uneasy with the configurations to the
rise of modern Chinese drama to be provided by three individual plays . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#46:1>
Compared with Fong  ' s panoramic view of the rise of modern
Chinese drama , Dr. Tam  ' s &ldquo; Drama of Dilemma : Waiting as Form and
Motif in <it> The Bus-stop </it> and <it> Waiting for Godot </it> &ldquo; is
more specific in its thematic parallel approach , dwelling on the existential
theme of waiting and the passage of time as main aspects of comparison &semi;
though distinguishing the Chinese play  ' s social and political implications
from the Western play  ' s philosophical and religious concerns , Tam seems to
have dwelt a bit too often on thematic parallelism and explication , and has
to justify the first half of his title , &ldquo; Waiting as Form &rdquo; more
, in addition to mentioning only in passing both plays share a circular
structure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#47:1>
If there is another caveat one has to make , perhaps , it is his
enthusiasm in analogizing the time parallels in both plays , which at times
strikes one as a bit passionate for sameness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#48:1>
Dr. Toshihiko Sato  ' s article , &ldquo; Ibsen  ' s <it> The Lady
from the Sea </it> , T'ien Han  ' s <it> Return to the South </it> , and Sato
Koroku  ' s <it> The Disabled Horse </it> : A Comparative Study, &rdquo; is
what its title tries to suggest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#49:1>
Through textual analysis , Dr. Sato points out that the two Asian
plays were written under the influence of Ibsen  ' s romantic play , and that
among them , there are enough parallels in dialogue , characterization and
dramatic techniques to warrant a case of influence and reception .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#50:1>
Reasonable as it sounds , Sato  ' s article is informative , pointing
out what has already been known generally , and could use more in-depth
cultural and aesthetic analysis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#51:1>
The interesting aspect of Sato  ' s article , however , lies in its
intra-Asian comparative literature perspective , and raises a curious
question : How do the Chinese and Japanese writers , in this case , T'ien Han
and Sato Koroku , differ or resemble each other in their cultural and
literary adoption of Ibsen  ' s ideas and dramaturgy , conditioned as they were
by their own cultural , traditional , aesthetic and social milieu ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#52:1>
This would seem a very crucial and enriching aspect to the
reinforcement of a somewhat generalized comparison . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#53:1>
The second group of articles by Professors C. H. Wang , Han-liang
Chang and Mr. Sai-shing Yung share a structural concern in their respective
analyses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#54:1>
Professor Wang  ' s article , &ldquo; The Double Plot of <it> T'ao-hua
shan </it> &ldquo; is an analysis of the interrelationship between fiction
and historicity embedded in a double plot , which dramatizes respectively the
representation of a romantic love affair on the one hand , and the fall of
the Ming empire on the other .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#55:1>
This dual representation is <-> interwined </-> <+> <?> intertwined
</?> </+> by the double plot structure in such a way , according to Professor
Wang , that &ldquo; it employs the emotions entailed by separation and union
to depict feelings about the rise and fall. &rdquo; Though without expressly
claiming to define the tragic theme or spirit of the play , his analysis of
the double plot framework converges on what he describes as &ldquo;
theatrically moving and literarily powerful, &rdquo; which is just the tragic
essence of this particular play . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#56:1>
More structuralist in argumentation , Professor Han-liang Chang  ' s
article , &ldquo; Mimetic Desire/Dramatic Structure : Racine  ' s <it> Phaedra
</it> Ma Chih-yuan  ' s <it> Han-kung ch'iu </it> , &rdquo; begins with an
elucidation of Rene Girard  ' s triangular model of desire , mediator and
<foreign> vaniteur </foreign> , and A. J. Griemas  '  actantial matrix of
desire , communication and power &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#57:1>
he follows in the second part with the application of these two
models interchangeably to two dramatic texts widely separated in time and
space as Racine  ' s <it> Phaedra </it> and Ma chih-yuan  ' s <it> Han-kung ch'iu
</it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#58:1>
Professor Chang  ' s objective is to point out relationships between
desire and writing , verbal relations between characters in the dramatic
discourse , or relationships between the playwright and his precursor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#59:1>
In the course of applying Girard and Griemas , he also makes
reference to Freud  ' s Eros and Thanatos , concerning the character analysis
of Hippolytus and Khan Hu-yen of the two plays in question . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#60:1>
Mr. Sai-shing Yung  ' s article , &ldquo; <it> Tsa-chu </it> as a
Lyrical Form, &rdquo; is a lucid account of the aesthetics of Yuan <it>
tsa-chu </it> as being constituted by two structural elements , the narrative
act and the lyrical act which govern the movement of events and the movement
of mind respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#61:1>
Mr. Yung points out the significance of the actor-oriented system of
Chinese theatre is attributed to centring the main character in the lyrical
act , and thereby explains one of the most salient features of traditional
Chinese theatre .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#62:1>
Though Mr. Yung is traditional in his elucidation as a whole , he at
times cross-refers to Russian formalism as well as semiotics to help clarify
his argument . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#63:1>
The third group of articles by Miss Shu-chu Wei , Dr. Sheng-chuan
Lai and Mr. William Hui-zhu Sun are more theatre-oriented in their analyses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#64:1>
Miss Wei  ' s article , &ldquo; English Renaissance Acting : With
Reference to Peking Opera, &rdquo; is an application of Peking opera
techniques to some of the Elizabethan plays , especially Shakespeare  ' s ,
with the intention of &ldquo; representing &rdquo; the Elizabethan acting
style , an attempt inspired by Professor Leonard Pronko  ' s application of
Kabuki to the Elizabethan plays for the same purpose .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#65:1>
Miss Wei points out the open stage , simplicity of properties ,
fluidity of location , imaginative participation of the audience as
constituent points of parallels , taking examples from <it> Romeo and Juliet
</it> , <it> A Midsummer Night  ' s Dream </it> , <it> The Tempest </it> , <it>
Dr. Faustus </it> , <it> Hamlet </it> and <it> King Lear </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#66:1>
Miss Wei  ' s speculation is interesting and is not far-fetched as it
may seem at first .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#67:1>
In fact , what she is proposing is not an imposition of foreign model
but an exposition of the salient features shared in general by all
non-illusionistic theatres . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#68:1>
Dr. Sheng-chuan Lai  ' s article , &ldquo; The Structuring of
Spontaneity : An Assessment and Documentation of Improvisational Creative
Methods in the Modern Taiwan Theatre, &rdquo; begins with a general
background to the use of improvisation in the arts &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#69:1>
then it moves on to detail the rise of improvisation in the decade
from 1978 to 1987 in modern Taiwanese theatre , with a specific and personal
illustration of the writer  ' s own works .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#70:1>
With an eye on the theatre , Dr. Lai states how he works with the
method through a continual process of interaction between director and actors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#71:1>
According to him , the objective of this improvisational method is
twofold : to experiment new forms of expression and to rebel against
traditional forms and methods in Chinese theatre .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#72:1>
Nevertheless , he acknowledges that such a rebellion eventually takes
on certain characteristics of traditional forms and method , and hence , he
ends his articles not without some ambivalence , registering the feelings of
how a die-hard tradition-conscious psyche grapples with the fact of
assimilating Western methods and influence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#73:1>
Mr. William Hui-zhu Sun  ' s article , &ldquo; Blurring Line
between Stage and Life : &lsquo; Poor Theatre &rsquo; in China, &rdquo;
borrows more Grotowski  ' s terminology than his concept of theatre to discuss
the rural theatre in Ting Hsien of northern China between 1932 and 1936 , led
by Hsiung Fo-hsi <O> Chinese-characters </O> , one of the pioneers of modern
Chinese theatre .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#74:1>
Mr. Sun  ' s article touches on a topic of theatrical interest , which
surprisingly has seldom been heeded by scholars .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#75:1>
Mr. Sun is to be credited with having called our attention to it .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#76:1>
However , Mr. Sun seems a bit so carried away with his Grotowskian
parallel that he raises a few methodological loose ends .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#77:1>
Speaking of the &ldquo; poorness &rdquo; of the pre-modern Chinese
experimental theatre , led by Hsiung Fo-hsi , Mr. Sun <-> suceeds </-> <+>
succeeds </+> in demonstrating the poorness of this theatre in its
socio-economic sense , which is not exactly Grotowski  ' s &ldquo; back to the
essentials &rdquo; poorness , with its emphasis on actor-training and
actor-audience relationships .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#78:1>
Hsiung  ' s theatre , though involving peasants and amateurs , may lend
itself to be &ldquo; poor &rdquo; in view of its actor-audience proximity ,
being ritualistic and paratheatrical in nature &semi; but it show hardly any
concern for rigorous training of actors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-007#79:1>
The fourth group of articles is represented by two
Shakespeare-related studies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#80:1>
Professor Mei-shu Hwang  ' s article , &ldquo; The deaths of Cordelia
and Tou O : Morality or Theatricality, &rdquo; does not purport to make a
case of affinity study between <it> King Lear </it> and <it> Tou O yuan </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#81:1>
Instead , he attempts to use elements of their plots , i.e. , the
deaths of Cordelia and Tou O , more specifically , Tou O  ' s three wishes and
their eventual fulfilment , to show the playwright  ' s choice between logical
probability and theatrical effectiveness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#82:1>
Thus , it may not be necessary to cavil at the logic of their
development as Hwang  ' s argument seems to suggest , if the desired
theatricality is to be realized .

<ICE-HK:W2A-007#83:1>
Hence , moral feelings about these two plays should be secondary to
what Professor Hwang calls theatricality . </p> </I>
