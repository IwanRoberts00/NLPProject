Some of Hong Kong  ' s venomous snake species
were discussed in the last issue .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#3:1>
This time we are going to introduce some common non-venomous
native snakes and provide suggestions on measures to take
when you encounter a snake and even bitten by it in the countryside .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#4:1>
Currently there are 30 native species of terrestrial non-venomous
 snakes and 5 native species of mildly-venomous snakes in
Hong Kong . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

Many people fear snakes , believing they are either large and
dangerous or extremely poisonous .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#9:1>
Some are deadly , but in fact , most snakes are harmless and those
that are venomous often reluctantly waster their venom on humans ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#10:1>
Like most wild animals , snakes are actually afraid of humans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#11:1>
They generally avoid human whenever possible and quickly slither away
when approached .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#12:1>
Only when they feel threatened will they defend by biting .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#13:1>
In most cases , only those trying to catch the snakes , or even kill
them will be bitten by them . </p> <O> Four photos </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#14:1>
<bold> To avoid snakebite , the following preventive steps should be
followed: </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#15:1>
? Do not venture into areas like densely vegetated scrublands ,
forests , dark caves and tunnels - these are home to snakes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#16:1>
? You should be appropriately equipped before entering the dense
vegetation: a pair of long boots and trousers can protect your legs from
animal bite .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#17:1>
Before proceeding , use a long stick to poke the long grasses beyond
you aside to check if it is safe to step forward . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#18:1>
? Do not enter dark caves without adequate tools and lighting ,
as these hidden areas are usually comfortable homes for snakes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#19:1>
A torch can make your journey safer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#20:1>
? Snakes may hide within rock crevices or under fallen tree
branches .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#21:1>
Always wear a pair of thick leather gloves when handling or moving
these objects in the wild . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#22:1>
? When walking in risky areas , make heavier steps to create some
noises and vibrations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#23:1>
Lying flat on the ground , snakes are sensitive to even a little
vibration and they normally are scared away before you reach them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#24:1>
? Be alert when walking at night and in darkness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#25:1>
In addition to the precautions mentioned above , you should also pay
special attention to any strange noise made by animal moving in grassland or
litter . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#26:1>
<bold> If you encounter a snake in the wild , remember to: </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#27:1>
? Stay calm and still .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#28:1>
Snakes normally do not attack stationary objects and this applies to
humans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#29:1>
Retreat slowly when there is a snake ahead . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#30:1>
? Keep a distance from snakes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#31:1>
Don't get close to it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#32:1>
Normally the snake will ward off quickly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#33:1>
? Never try to kill snakes or it puts you at risk .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#34:1>
Your intention to kill will put you in close contact with the snake ,
which would be fierce enough to fight for its survival . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#35:1>
? Never pick up a snake carcass when it is
not necessary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#36:1>
Venom of a dead snake is still poisonous .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#37:1>
Getting venom in contact with your wound is
equally dangerous as being bitten by a venomous snake .
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#38:1>
<bold> If you are bitten by a snake: </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#39:1>
? Stay calm and do not make unnecessary move , or it speeds up
blood circulation , spreading venom around your body .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#40:1>
? Call Emergency Hotline at 999 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#41:1>
? Never attempt to cut the wound or suck the venom
out of the wound .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#42:1>
It only puts the victim at greater risk or secondary bacterial
infection .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#43:1>
The one who sucks the venom might also fall
victim to the venom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#44:1>
? Don't take alcohol as this speeds up blood circulation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#45:1>
? Identify the snake species if possible .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#46:1>
Take notes on its size , main body colour , head shape , and its
other distinctive mark or behaviour .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#47:1>
This information enables doctors to identify the appropriate type of
serum for treating the victim . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#48:1>
? Never attempt to catch the snake that bites you .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#49:1>
This puts yourself at greater peril . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#50:1>
? The first-aid course offered by St . John Ambulance Service and
Red Cross covers first-aid treatment for snakebite .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#51:1>
Seek advice from trained persons if there is one on spot . </p> <O>

long .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#55:1>
Unmistakable feature: brown trunk with irregular-shaped blotches;
triangular head with heat- sensing pits between the nostrils and the eyes for
detecting warm-blooded preys .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#56:1>
A pair of spurs can be found near cloaca . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#57:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> Python can be found in
a wide variety of habitat including scrubland , swamps and woodlands .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#58:1>
They are the only predator &obrack;  except human &cbrack; to local large mammals
like barking deer , juvenile wild boars , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#59:1>
They occasionally intrude in domestic poultry farms and prey on the
domesticated animals there .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#60:1>
Pythons usually entwine its prey by its body and then kill it by
constriction .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#61:1>
This makes swallowing of prey easier .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#62:1>
Each time females lay about 30 eggs , each is slightly larger than a
compute mouse .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#63:1>
During incubation , female pythons wind the eggs by its body to raise
body temperature , until the eggs hatch . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese

They can be found in many habitats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#69:1>
Sometimes they might intrude in houses in rural areas when they are
searching for rats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#70:1>
They are active in daytime , as they have very good eyesight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#71:1>
Once caught , they would struggle and release smelly faeces from vent
as a defence .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#72:1>
Since rodents are one of their main food items , they help control
rodent population in the wild . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation

<bold> Common blind snake </bold> <it> Ramphotyphlops barminus </it>
</h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#88:1>
<bold> ID features: </bold> They are a kind of non-venomous snake
of smaller body size .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#89:1>
They are dark brown to black in colour , and their trunks are
cylindrical without any dots or marking .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#90:1>
People sometimes mis-identify them as earthworms .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#91:1>
The main difference between common blind snakes and earthworms is the
presence of scales on common blind snakes if one looks carefully .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#92:1>
The common blind snakes actually bear eyes , but they are rather
difficult to see . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#93:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> Common blind snakes can be found in many
terrestrial habitats .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#94:1>
They mostly hide underneath some objects like rocks , wood and fallen
leaf layer .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#95:1>
They mainly feed on ant larvae and termites .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#96:1>
All females are pathenogenetic , which means they can undergo asexual
reproduction . </p> <O> A photo </O> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

And its body can be up to 0.8 m long .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#100:1>
Two black thin stripes streak from eyes to &ldquo; lips" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#101:1>
They look similar to Common Rat Snake , but they lack white body
crossbands and black bars on their upper &ldquo; lip" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#102:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> Checkered Keelback prefers habitats near
water source .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#103:1>
Like lowland ponds , streams and wet cultivated fields .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#104:1>
From their name you will recognize they are very good swimmer and
diver , and have been reported to have remained under water for 20 minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#105:1>
They mainly feed on aquatic animals like fish , frogs , and tadpoles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#108:1>
<bold> ID feature: </bold> They body trunk of Greater Green
Snake is entirely green , from head to tail &obrack;  This is different to Bamboo
snake , which bears a red tip at the tail region &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#109:1>
Its ventral side is slightly greenish-yellow .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#110:1>
The scales on its head are large , while bamboo snake has granular
smaller head scales .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#111:1>
Besides , they do not have pits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#112:1>
Greater Green Snake bear a pair of big eyes , which are needed for
diurnal activity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#113:1>
<bold> Habit: </bold> It prefers areas with dense vegetation
like: scrubland , woodland and forest .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#114:1>
It is reported that it eats earthworms , caterpillars and insects .

<bold> Last words </bold> </h> <O> Chinese translation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#116:1>
As eating snakes is still a common tradition among Chinese ,
every year a large amount of venomous and non-venomous
snakes are imported into Hong Kong for food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#117:1>
Some of them may escape accidentally during transportation or from
snake shops , and it is possible for them to reproduce when a male and female
met in the wild .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#118:1>
We confirmed that currently a non-native snake species Black-browed
racer has successfully bred on HK Island as we have found some young snakes
near the Peak area .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#119:1>
As keeping snakes as pets is becoming more popular , it is possible
that more exotic snakes have already settled in Hong Kong countryside .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#120:1>
They made compete for food resource with the native species . </p>

Alternative health experts say strengthening the immune system is
the best way of averting atypical pneumonia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#124:2>
<bold> Shirely Lau </bold> reports . </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#125:2>
<bold> AS THE FIGHT </bold> continued to control the atypical
pneumonia outbreak , the Natural Health Association hastily convened a talk
last week to discuss ways in which alternative and traditional Chinese
medicine could help combat the problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#126:2>
Among the audience was Ken Bridgewater from Tai Po , whose wife
came down with the disease in February and recovered a month later .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#127:2>
 '  ' I had been in close proximity to her most of the time and I
didn't get it,' ' the 75-year-old told the meeting .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#128:2>
 '  ' I  ' m very fit and have a strong immune system .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#129:2>
Why should I fear?' ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#130:2>
Such a positive attitude is what Hong Kong badly needs now as
the epidemic causes panic .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#131:2>
And a key to defeating the virus causing the severe acute
respiratory syndrome &obrack;  Sars &cbrack; , according to the medical experts at the talk ,
is to build and maintain a strong immune system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#132:2>
A healthy diet , exercise and sufficient sleep are essential
ways of maintaining the body  ' s immunity against illness in general .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#133:2>
But there are alternative approaches based on different medical
theories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#134:2>
Professor Li Zhizhong , a visiting scholar at the School of
Traditional Chinese Medicine &obrack;  TCM &cbrack; in Hong Kong Baptist University , says it
is important to first understand how humans respond to climatic changes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#135:2>
According to Li , lichun , or the 45th day after the winter equinox
, signifies the beginning of an unstable climate that alternates between warm
and cold weather .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#136:2>
 '  ' In Chinese traditional medicine , it is the time when people
easily succumb to illnesses that involve accumulation of heat inside the
body,' ' he says , adding that atypical pneumonia falls under the category of
such illnesses . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#137:2>
Li says the Lunar New Year on February 1 , which came unusually
early on the lunar calendar , might also have contributed to the outbreak .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#138:2>
 '  ' The Lunar New Year came a few days before <it> lichun </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#139:2>
During this time , people went out a lot to see friends and
relatives , travelled and ate unhealthy food .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#140:2>
This led to even more accumulation of internal heat,' ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#141:2>
 '  ' Besides , the winter in the northern hemisphere this year was
unusually severe .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#142:2>
Though it has been two months after the winter equinox , we have yet
to see many warm days.' ' </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#143:2>
Despite the unfavourable climatic conditions , the professor
says there are a host of preventive measures that contribute to a stronger
immune system against illnesses , including atypical pneumonia .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#144:2>
 '  ' In Chinese traditional medicine .. . the essence of combating a
virus lies in maintaining harmony between the yin and yang forces,' ' he says .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#145:2>
An abstract concept the forces may be , but most of the
suggestions Li offers are practical and simple .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#146:2>
They include drinking plenty of water , avoid overwork , take
exercise and ensuring good ventilation when indoors .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#147:2>
For alternative approaches , one can take food that helps cool down
internal body heat , such as congee made of rice , green beans and carrots .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#148:2>
Traditional foods that can raise body heat , such as ginseng ,
antler and dong quai , should be off the menu . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#149:2>
Dr Alexander Yuan Tai-ming , a homeopathy practitioner , says
alternative medicine is effective in fighting the Sars virus .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#150:2>
Based on the theory of  '   ' like cures like' ' , the treatment of
homeopathy involves heavily diluted solutions of natural ingredients , of
which the content varies depending on a patient  ' s condition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#151:2>
 '  ' In the past , homeopathy had been used successfully in
treating yellow fever , diphtheria and illnesses related to viruses,' ' Yuan
says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#152:2>
 '  ' I don't know if I have treated patients &obrack;  who have come down with
the Sars virus &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#153:2>
It  ' s possible that homeopathy has cured them before their illness
develops into atypical pneumonia.''

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#154:2>
He recommends a daily intake of 30CP , a type of homeopathic remedy
, as one way to strengthen the immune system against the virus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#155:2>
However , legislator Dr Lo Wing-lok , a specialist in infectious
diseases , warns medical practitioners to treat the virus in a strictly
scientific manner .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#156:2>
 '  ' This is a new virus that kills and we don't know enough about it .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#157:2>
It  ' s not the time to make claims if a health- care practitioner has
not come across it,' ' he says . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#160:2>
Western medical practitioner Dr Tim Trodd , another speaker ,
advocates a conventional approach in enhancing one  ' s immunity against the
Sars virus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#161:2>
 '  ' It is important we all minimise the chances of coming into
contact with illness .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#162:2>
We should take government advice to improve diet , not to smoke or
drink alcohol,' ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#163:2>
He also suggests taking supplements such as vitamin C , zinc and
essential fatty acid that can all strengthen the immune system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-030#164:2>
Trodd says such measures are related to the terrain theory
devised in the 19th century by French scientist Antoine Bechamp , who
believed disease came from inside the body .

<ICE-HK:W2B-030#165:2>
