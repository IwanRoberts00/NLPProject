<ICE-HK:W2A-006#2:1>
There has been a fair amount of published research on Hong
Kong-specific learner errors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#3:1>
However , compared with the availability of numerous handbooks on
common errors intended largely for &lsquo; popular consumption &rsquo; ,
empirical research on errors made by Chinese ESL learners and pedagogically
oriented error-correction materials are scanty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#4:1>
Yip &obrack; 1995 &cbrack; is one notable exception .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#5:1>
Drawing on insights from both Universal Grammar and language typology
, Yip &obrack; 1995 &cbrack; is a systematic study of Chinese interlanguage
&obrack; CIL &cbrack; - a relatively stable grammar which has its own
properties and internal logic but which falls short of target language norms .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#6:1>
Her study is based on mainly production data &dash; written
compositions , oral reports , casual conversations &dash; of 20 Chinese ESL
learners &obrack; 10 intermediate and 10 advanced learners &cbrack; mostly
from Taiwan , who were typically recent arrivals in the United States .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#7:1>
Grammaticality judgement questionnaires were also used to tap into the
grammatical competence of the learners &lsquo; interlanguage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#8:1>
Four CIL structures were studied in detail : <O> examples </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#9:1>
While pseudo-passives and existential pseudo-relatives refer to
faulty constructions which are more appropriately expressed using a passive
&obrack; e.g., <mention> <it> Erhu can be played like this </it> </mention>
&cbrack; and relative structure &obrack; e.g., <mention> <it> There were many
passengers who died in the accident </it> </mention> &cbrack; , respectively
, sentences with pseudo-tough movement as in &obrack; c &cbrack; refer to
constructions which cannot be expressed using the tough-movement structure
such as <mention> <it> English is difficult to learn </it> </mention> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#10:1>
Ergative constructions , on the other hand , involve the
inappropriate passivization of ergative verbs which can be used both
transitively and intransitively , including the passivization of verbs which
should only be used intransitively . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#11:1>
Among the key findings in Yip &obrack; 1995 &cbrack; are the
observations that both transfer from L1 and universal developmental features
in language acquisition are attested , and that the degree of learnability of
a target language hinges on and may be explained by systematic structural
contrasts between Ll and L2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#12:1>
While a significant contribution to the literature on interlanguage
research in SLA , Yip &obrack; 1995 &cbrack; makes it clear that pedagogical
implications will not be discussed in her study .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#13:1>
Although the erroneous constructions she scrutinized were largely
derived from a study of Mandarin-speaking ESL learners , our own observations
suggest that her data was comparable to syntactically deviant constructions
made by Cantonese-speaking ESL learners in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#14:1>
Apart from Yip &obrack; 1995 &cbrack; , to our knowledge CIL has
not yet been subjected to large-scale , systematic investigation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#15:1>
In those studies which do involve CIL , errors are typically based on
limited data &obrack; e.g. , Jones , 1980; Lay , 1975; Rutherford , 1983
&cbrack; or they are secondary in focus in many theoretical studies in SLA
&obrack; e.g. , Schachter , 1974 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#16:1>
Consequently , little is known about how Chinese ESL learners ,
especially adults , acquire English and other foreign languages in Chinese
communities &obrack; see Wong , 1988 , for a critical if somewhat dated
review of selected research concerning the learning difficulties of English
by Chinese speakers &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#17:1>
The comparative lack of research in SLA involving Chinese learners is
all the more marked given the fact that native speakers of Chinese make up
the largest group of ESL learners today &obrack; Cortazzi &ampersand; Jin ,
1996 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#18:1>
There is thus a need to investigate systematically how Chinese
learners acquire English , what difficulties they encounter , and what errors
they make at different stages of the learning process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#19:1>
In addition to the practical objective of helping ESL teachers
deliver quality error-correction feedback , it is believed that research on
Hong Kong-specific CIL will inform SLA theories by filling some information
gaps that involve the acquisition of English by learners from a typologically
distant L1 background such as Cantonese . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#20:1>
<bold> Misuse of words </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#21:1>
Apart from rule-governed structural anomalies , many of the
accuracy problems may be explained by substandard mastery of content words ,
especially verbs , nouns and adjectives , in that order .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#22:1>
Research in the past two decades has shown that second language
vocabulary plays a much more important role than was previously thought to be
the case , and therefore should not be disregarded &obrack; e.g. , Carter
&ampersand; McCarthy , 1991 &semi; Coady &ampersand; Huckin , 1997 &semi;
Huckin et al. , 1993; Nation , 1990 &semi; Richards , 1976 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#23:1>
In particular , research has shown that accuracy of language use may
be significantly improved with the mastery of the correct usage of the
vocabulary item .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#24:1>
It is in this sense that Gairns &ampersand; Redman &obrack; 1986
&cbrack; speak of the &lsquo; grammar of vocabulary &rsquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#25:1>
Typical examples include the misuse of verb transitivity or confusion
between noun and verb forms &obrack; e.g. , <mention> <it> &asterisk; to
emphasise on something </it> </mention> , <mention  <It> > &asterisk to
discuss about something </it> </mention> &cbrack; , preposition &obrack; e.g.
, <mention> <it> &asterisk to walk under the sun </it> </mention> &cbrack; ,
or plural form of an uncountable noun &obrack; e.g. , <mention> <it>
&asterisk we need more informations and equipments </it> </mention> &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#26:1>
This insight helps justify why for local ESL teachers , curriculum
writers and syllabus designers , a separate , pedagogically sound word-based
taxonomy will be a useful complement to the conventional structure-based
taxonomy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#27:1>
A survey of a number of relevant works on ESL errors , error
analysis and crosslinguistic influence involving Hong Kong Chinese learners
shows that these works fall into two main types : &obrack; a &cbrack;
scholarly work appearing in journal articles , and &obrack; b &cbrack; books
on common errors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#28:1>
Most scholarly work in these areas appears in publications of
academic departments of local universities , while specialist volumes on
common errors are meant to be for reference of local learners and teachers of
English who make up the main target readers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#29:1>
Below we will briefly review these two types of literature . </p> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#32:1>
Perhaps the most conspicuous attempt to explore local ESL errors
systematically and to assess their impact on teaching and learning is to be
found in the second special issue of <It> Institute of Language in Education
Journal </it> &obrack; ILEJ &cbrack; edited by David Bunton and Christopher
Green &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#33:1>
It contains seven papers covering a wide range of related issues ,
from Bunton  ' s &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; study assessing the distinctiveness of
Hong Kong-specific errors vis-a-vis errors obtained in an international error
sample &obrack; Heaton &ampersand; Turton , 1987 &cbrack; , to Green  ' s
&obrack; 1991b &cbrack; survey of teachers  '  perceptions of &lsquo; error
gravity &rsquo; , which has a direct bearing on the grading of student
compositions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#34:1>
Bunton  ' s &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; findings show that only 108 &obrack;
or 26.7 percent &cbrack; of the 404 Hong Kong errors as stated in his
&obrack; 1989 &cbrack; book are actually represented in the international
sample , suggesting that the majority of the errors are distinct to Hong Kong
Chinese ESL learners , of which the clearest examples are the lexical
misselection , semantic mismatch and inappropriate collocation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#35:1>
Many other structural errors are compared in his study . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#36:1>
Four other studies in the ILEJ volume make reference to local ESL
errors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#37:1>
Newbrook &obrack; 1991b &cbrack; critiques a number of locally
produced &lsquo; guides to English usage &rsquo; &obrack; see below &cbrack;
, most of which were written by Hong Kong Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#38:1>
Chan &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; analyses errors involving the misuse of
transitive verbs and passive construction found in 156 compositions of Form 6
students , and concludes that these two types of errors are probably due to
negative transfer from Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#39:1>
Sung &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; adopts a cross-sectional design to elicit
written English output from 30 students of varying proficiency levels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#40:1>
The results seem to lend support to the hypotheses that &obrack; a
&cbrack; typological transfer of topic-comment structure so commonly found in
Chinese varieties is attested , especially those with lower proficiency of
English , and &obrack; b &cbrack; learners with higher proficiency levels
tend to produce sentences with subject-predicate structure in accordance with
norms of standard English , suggesting an interlanguage continuum along which
the topic-comment structure gradually gives way to the more normative
subject-predicate structure of English as the learner progresses to a higher
proficiency level . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#41:1>
The last of the four studies &obrack; Webster &ampersand; Lam ,
1991 &cbrack; in the above-mentioned ILEJ volume is a follow-up study of
Webster et al. &obrack; 1987 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#42:1>
Based on written work by students , interviews with students and a
questionnaire survey with ESL teachers at the British Council , Webster et
al. &obrack; 1987 &cbrack; present local ESL errors at various levels : from
morphology , lexis , syntax to discourse .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#43:1>
In Webster &ampersand; Lam &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; , some of these
issues are clarified and extended , and a few misused verbs such as <mention>
<it> suggest </it> </mention> , <mention> <it> help </it> </mention> ,
<mention> <it> change </it> </mention> and <mention> <it> send </it>
</mention> are included .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#44:1>
Of theoretical interest in these two papers is that the authors
attribute the errors , though not exclusively , to mother-tongue influence
&obrack; cf. Chan , 1991; Sung , 1991 &cbrack; , including the slightly odd
warning found ubiquitously in public places apparently translated from
Chinese : <mention> <it> When there is a fire , do not use the lift </it>
</mention> , where the use of <mention> <it> when </it> </mention> in
standard English , according to the authors , would suggest that a fire , or
even several fires , <It> will </it> take place at some unspecified time
later &obrack; Webster &ampersand; Lam , 1991 , pp. 36f &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#45:1>
Elsewhere , Newbrook &obrack; 1988 &cbrack; explores typical
errors in relative clauses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#46:1>
Yip &ampersand; Matthews &obrack; 1991 &cbrack; present evidence of
Hong Kong learners &lsquo; avoidance of &dash; and difficulties using &dash;
relative clauses , especially when oblique or genitive is involved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#47:1>
Green &obrack; 1991a &cbrack; examines the overuse of topic-comment
structure in Hong Kong Chinese learners &lsquo; English which is cited as
evidence of typological transfer , resulting in &lsquo; discourse accent
&rsquo; , or &lsquo; unnecessary topic-comment structure &lsquo; as we prefer
to call it &obrack; e.g. , <mention> <it> For those staff who acted as senior
ones , they earn more salary </it> </mention> , p. 55; cf. &lsquo;
periphrastic topic construction &rsquo; , Yip , 1995 &semi; see also
Rutherford , 1983 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#48:1>
Comparing &lsquo; Hong Kong English &rsquo; with Singapore English ,
Budge &obrack; 1989 &cbrack; attributes Hong Kong students &lsquo; failure to
mark plural nouns with &obrack; s &cbrack; in writing partly to Cantonese
phonology , that is , the fact that Cantonese has no final &obrack; s
&cbrack; or final consonant clusters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#49:1>
The same reason probably accounts for the systematic omission of
plural marking for English words ending with alveolar fricatives , as in
<mention> <it> many <ul> waitress </ul> and waiters </it> </mention> &obrack;
p. 12 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#50:1>
Lee &obrack; 1990 &cbrack; addresses pedagogical issues such as
when to correct learner errors and what types of errors should receive
priority attention of the ESL teacher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#51:1>
Based on oral classroom data , Lee &obrack; 1990 &cbrack; discusses
different levels of errors , their relative teachability , and the need for
corrective treatment in cases where &lsquo; error gravity &rsquo; is high ,
as when intelligibility or communicability is at stake &obrack; i.e. ,
&lsquo; global &rsquo; instead of &lsquo; local &rsquo; errors &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#52:1>
She also expresses doubt about the desirability of correcting
high-frequency errors and argues that , other things being equal , it is
error type rather than error token that matters .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#53:1>
Further , she queries the practicality of the general advice that
errors which stigmatize the learner should be corrected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#54:1>
In her view , this advice may not be easy to follow since it is not
immediately clear which error is stigmatized by which type(s &cbrack; of native
speakers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#55:1>
More recently , there are a few corpus-based projects of ESL
errors involving Chinese learners .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#56:1>
Granger et al. &obrack; 1994 &cbrack; report work in progress on
their ICLE project &obrack; <It> International Corpus of Learner English
</it> &cbrack; involving learner errors from nine Ll backgrounds , including
Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#57:1>
From each of the nine sources , a computerized one-million-word
corpus comprising written data of five different learner varieties will be
created .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#58:1>
Learner profile will be carefully controlled to ensure comparability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#59:1>
Native-speaker language output will be used as baseline data for
comparison .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#60:1>
Data will be processed rigorously in five stages : encoding , markup
, word-category tagging , parsing and coding .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#61:1>
In the same volume as Granger et al. &obrack; 1994 &cbrack; , McNeill
&obrack; 1994 &cbrack; gives a progress report of the development of a
&lsquo; Hong Kong corpus of lexical errors in spontaneous speech &lsquo;
obtained from spontaneous conversations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#62:1>
He points out the pedagogical limitations of using concordancing to
study learner errors in a corpus , especially with regard to second language
vocabulary acquisition and argues that , in terms of insights into the nature
of learner difficulties or explanations as to why errors occurred in the
first place , it does not seem fruitful to compare the correct English of
native speakers  '  base-line data with L2 learner errors in a corpus . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-006#63:1>
The brief review of scholarly work on Hong Kong-specific ESL
errors above suggests that work in this area remains fragmented and limited
in scope .

<ICE-HK:W2A-006#64:1>
From both the practical point of view of providing useful suggestions
for making pedagogically sound error-correction instruction , as well as the
theoretical perspective of enlightening the international research community
on Hong Kong CIL-specific cross linguistic influence and interlanguage
research , there is clearly a need for a large-scale , systematic study of
Hong Kong-based learner errors with a view to yielding empirical findings in
order to &obrack; a &cbrack; establish taxonomies of errors with regard to
different proficiency levels , &obrack; b &cbrack; design and experiment with
remedial materials continually with a view to helping learners overcome
recurrent ESL errors , and &obrack; c &cbrack; report findings to the
international research community about universal as well as unique features
of Hong Kong CIL . </p> </I>
