<bold> NAPCO silent on Allen payoff </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#2:1>
<bold> By CONNIE LAW </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#3:1>
THE Government has again refused to disclose the size of the
payoff to former Provisional Airport Authority &obrack; PAA &cbrack; chief
executive , Mr Richard Allen . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#4:1>
The director of the New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office , Mr
Billy Lam Chung-lun , wrote to legislators yesterday that the PAA board and
Mr Allen had previously entered into an agreement that neither would comment
on the circumstances of his departure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#5:1>
&ldquo; The board considered that it would be damaging to the
&obrack; new airport &cbrack; project if there were a public debate about the
circumstances, &rdquo; said Mr Lam . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#6:1>
&ldquo; To breach confidentiality in this case could therefore
undermine the reputation of the PAA &dash; both its ability to keep its more
general contractual obligations as well as those relating specifically to
confidentiality . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#7:1>
United Democrats airport spokesman Mr Albert Chan Wai-yip said he
was extremely dissatisfied with the answer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#8:1>
He added his party would carefully consider whether to exercise
their power through the Legislative Council &obrack; Powers and Privileges
&cbrack; Ordinance to ask Mr Macleod to disclose the information . </p> </I>

<bold> First Pay-TV operator to have exclusive rights for three years
</bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#10:2>
<bold> By CONNIE LAW </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#11:2>
HONGKONG  ' s first Pay-TV licence should be issued by January 1993
, and any licensee has to bring its system into operation within six to nine
months , the Executive Council has decided . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#12:2>
The Governor-in-Council gave approval for the licensee to have an
exclusive right to provide subscription television services for three years .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#13:2>
But Hongkong  ' s sole satellite TV operator , STAR TV , would not
be barred from operating subscription services provided it met stringent
conditions after October 1993 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#14:2>
The Exco decided that should STAR TV wish to introduce
satellite-based subscription services on a regional basis on top of its
existing free-to-air service , it had to meet the condition of no
broadcasting of Cantonese programmes in Hongkong during the three-year period
given to the Hongkong Pay-TV licensee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#15:2>
The Exco decisions were made on Tuesday and are to be formally
announced this afternoon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#16:2>
The restriction on Cantonese broadcasting applied to STAR TV will
be partially lifted in October 1993 when three of its five channels &dash;
namely news , sport and music &dash; will be allowed to broadcast Cantonese
programmes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#17:2>
A review will be carried out in October 1994 with a view to
allowing further Cantonese broadcasting on STAR  ' s remaining two channels .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#18:2>
Executive Councillors are understood to have seen some advantage
in the provision of cable-based operations as opposed to microwave operations
, due to cable  ' s quality of transmission and its potential for developing
ancillary interactive services . </p> Therefore , the Exco decision says the
Government would give favourable consideration to companies which intend to
introduce cable-based services , but it fell short of specifying which
delivery technology the licensee should adopt . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#19:2>
Exco also approved the adoption of a flexible approach in terms
of geographical coverage , programming and subscription rates for the new
licensee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#20:2>
Other than &ldquo; home-shopping &rdquo; channels , other Pay-TV
channels will not be allowed to run advertisements during the first three
years .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#21:2>
The moratorium will be reviewed at the end of the period . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#22:2>
The provider of subscription TV will not be required to provide a
second fixed link telecommunications network , but should a bidder wish to
provide telecommunications services over its network , it will be allowed to
do so . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#23:2>
No company of which Cable and Wireless or any of its subsidiaries
owns more than 15 per cent of its share capital will be allowed to bid for
the licence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#24:2>
The licensee would have to pay royalties on subscription income
on a sliding scale of up to 7 1/2 per cent.

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#25:2>
But the ceiling rate should not be applied until 250,000 households
have subscribed to the service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#26:2>
The two terrestrial broadcasters , Television Broadcast and Asia
Television , from October 1993 onwards , will also have their royalty payment
reduced by about two per cent based on a formula to be worked out by the
administration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#27:2>
A consultancy study carried out by the Government predicts that
the lifting of all restrictions on Cantonese broadcasting by STAR TV could
marginally affect the profitability of TVB and ATV by about two per cent of
total available net advertising revenue . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#28:2>
Some of the existing restrictions laid down in the two stations  ' 
current regulatory framework , that is programming , advertising and
ownership restriction should be relaxed . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#31:3>
EXECUTIVE Councillors have decided not to make public their
dealings on the local stock exchange . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#32:3>
They discussed the issue and decided they would only consider
releasing information about their dealings to the Exco secretariat . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#33:3>
The issue of conflict of interest has come under the spotlight
again after the Government sued former acting secretary for works Kenneth
Kwok Wai-kai for making &dollar;30 million by allegedly abusing his position .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#34:3>
Mr Kwok is alleged to have delayed moves to limit development
potential in Mid-Levels until he had sold a family property in the area .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#35:3>
The Financial Secretary , Sir Hamish Macleod , said last year
that the administration would look at whether to introduce a system of
registration and declaration of transactions in the local investment market .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#36:3>
The system could follow the disclosure rules used by directors of
the Securities and Futures Commission , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#37:3>
Exco members believe that their secretariat , staffed by civil
servants , could monitor whether any non-official members had any conflicts
of interests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#38:3>
They explained that it would be difficult to reveal every sale
and purchase of stock to the public because a few Exco members sat on the
boards of listed companies and any revelation might be commercially sensitive .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#39:3>
Some members were also said to be unwilling to let the public
know if they made or lost money in the transactions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#40:3>
Senior Executive Councillor Lady Dunn said there were
well-established procedures regarding declarations of interest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#41:3>
&ldquo; Members  '  directorships are declared in a register ,
which is available for public inspection, &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#42:3>
She said the administration was reviewing this matter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#43:3>
&ldquo; Whether there should be additional declarations will have
to await the outcome of the review . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#44:3>
Concern has been growing since early last year about the
possibility of Exco members using the information they have on issues such as
the Sino-British row to make money on the stock exchange . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#45:3>
It is understood the Independent Commission Against Corruption
goes through all documents to Exco members to ensure there are no potential
conflicts of interest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#46:3>
Exco members are not given the documents and are asked not to
attend meetings on subjects with which they have a conflict of interest .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#47:3>
The Securities &obrack; Insider Dealing &cbrack; Ordinance also
applies to them in relation to the use and disclosure of privileged
information . </p> </I>

THE United Democrats said they might ask for a Legislative
Council select committee to look into the Kwun Lung Lau landslide if the
Governor refused to set up an independent inquiry . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#51:4>
Legislators voted on Friday in favour of a judicial inquiry into
the July 23 landslide which killed five people . </p>

Chairman of the House Committee Elsie Tu and vice-chairman Andrew
Wong Wang-fat relayed the request to Acting Governor Anson Chan Fang On-sang
yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#53:4>
But United Democrat Albert Chan Wai-yip said the party was upset
by Mrs Chan  ' s &ldquo; passive attitude &rdquo; to the request . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#54:4>
Under the Legislative Council &obrack; Powers and Privileges
&cbrack; Ordinance , a select committee has the power to ask for any
documents and the attendance of anyone to give evidence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#55:4>
Mrs Chan said a decision had to be made by the Executive Council .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#56:4>
Exco is in recess until August 30 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#57:4>
She said the most pressing task was to complete the
administration  ' s own investigation .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#58:4>
She did not want to see a members  '  request putting a brake on it .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#59:4>
&ldquo; We will consider this request when we receive a formal
letter together with the terms of reference, &rdquo; she said.

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#60:4>
Mrs Tu sent in a formal request yesterday afternoon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#61:4>
Another party member said the Government  ' s study , to be
conducted by geotechnical expert Dr Norbert Morgenstern , lacked independence
and transparency and would not be as comprehensive as that sought by members .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#62:4>
Mrs Chan said Mr Morgenstern would arrive on August 19 and his
findings would be published . </p>

<bold> Poon to run in Kowloon Tong </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#67:5>
APPOINTED legislator Steven Poon Kwok-lim yesterday ended weeks
of speculation and revealed he would run in next month  ' s district board
elections . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#68:5>
Mr Poon is the first &dash; and believed to be the only &dash;
Liberal Party legislator to stand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#69:5>
He said &ldquo; Politics involve the masses .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#70:5>
I realise that if I want to spend more time on politics in future , I
have to start with the grassroots . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#71:5>
Mr Poon , ex-general manager of China Light and Power , denied he
was being contradictory in saying that he wanted to be closer to the
grassroots while running in the middle-class Kowloon Tong constituency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#72:5>
He said : &ldquo; It doesn't mean you don't have livelihood
problems if you own a car ... It doesn't mean the district does not have
grassroots if there is no public housing . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#73:5>
Mr Poon , appointed to the Legislative Council in 1991 , said he
did not choose Kowloon Tong because there were no public housing tenants
&dash; perceived as supporters of the small &ldquo; l &rdquo; liberals &dash;
and therefore had a higher chance of winning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#74:5>
&ldquo; I chose Kowloon Tong because I lived there for 26 years
and I know the district well, &rdquo; he said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#75:5>
Mr Poon now lives in Shouson Hill . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#76:5>
Mr Poon said it was too early to say whether he would run for
Legco next year through the Election Committee .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#77:5>
All district board members elected in September will form the
committee which will return 10 legislators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#78:5>
&ldquo; I am very happy to have the chance to ask people to vote
for me ...

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#79:5>
It  ' s a very challenging task, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#80:5>
The candidate list released by the party last Thursday said
another party member , Eddie Wong , was to run for the same constituency .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#81:5>
Vice-chairman of the party  ' s executive committee Chan Yim-kwong
said Mr Wong had decided not to contest because he had to retake his law .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#82:5>
He denied Mr Wong was forced to give way to Mr Poon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#83:5>
Mr Poon could face at least one opponent , Ho Hin-ming , who is
not affiliated to any party .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#84:5>
An ex-Liberal Party member , Mervyn Cheung Man-ping , yesterday said
he might run in Kowloon Tong as well . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#85:5>
Another 32 people signed up for the district boards yesterday ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#88:6>
THE container-terminal industry has lashed out at what it says is
the Government  ' s lack of leadership on port development in Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#89:6>
It also claims that a Government-commissioned study says the
first berths at Container Terminal 10 &obrack; CT10 &cbrack; will not come on
stream until January 1999 and the others until October 1999 , which means 19
months and 28 months late respectively . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#90:6>
In a recent submission to the Lantau Port Liaison Group , five
current and future container-terminal operators and the Hong Kong Liner
Shipping Association say : &ldquo; There appears to be no one driving the
development of the port .

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#91:6>
There is no single department having control over the key issues and
timely decisions . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#92:6>
The Port Development Board under the Economic Services Branch is
in charge of port development . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#93:6>
&ldquo; The confusion and delay over the development of the
container port since Container Terminal Eight leads us to believe that the
institutional arrangements for Government decisions are unsatisfactory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#94:6>
&ldquo; There has been a severe lack of resources devoted to the
needs of the port . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#95:6>
The submission , dated August 1 , says the operators cannot move
without initial decisions by the Government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#96:6>
The industry proposes setting up a Lantau and Western Harbour
Project Office under the Port Development Board to be responsible for the
overall planning , management and co-ordination of the Lantau Port
Development , including CT10 and CT11 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#97:6>
The office should be headed by a project director recruited from
the private sector and have a professional staff of six to eight . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#98:6>
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the airport authority
demonstrated the advantages of having overall management control in a single
office and placing management decisions in an authority with a degree of
independence from bodies that &ldquo; have many diverse priorities &rdquo; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#99:6>
The industry says the proposal was raised in a 1992 consultancy
report commissioned by the Civil Engineering Department and it should be
implemented as soon as possible . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#100:6>
The Government should now be seeking expressions of interests in
the construction and management of CT10 and CT11 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#101:6>
And &ldquo; the experience with Terminal Nine makes it essential
to consult the Chinese authorities immediately on all issues of Lantau Port
&rdquo; , it says . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#102:6>
&ldquo; The decision to split the allocation of Terminal Nine
leaves the Kwai Chung-Tsing Yi area fragmented . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#103:6>
The Government has split the four berths of CT9 between two
operators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#104:6>
For CT10 and CT11 , operators should be given at least four
berths in order to handle fourth and fifth generation container ships . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#105:6>
It says the demand for throughput in 1999 would be some 3.4
million 20-foot equivalent units in excess of the capacity of CT1 to CT9 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#106:6>
The shortfall will lead to congestion problems in Kwai Chung
container port and the New Territories from 1995 if no new capacity is
developed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#107:6>
It is vital for the Government to immediately intensify planning
for the development of the Lantau Port , comprehensively assess the capacity
of Southern China ports and allocate waterfront and backup land to the
existing operators to ensure maximum throughput capacity , the submission
says . </p> </I>

LESS than half of the investor immigrants to Quebec remain after
making the required investment , a senior official from the Canadian province
has said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#111:7>
Quebec , the only Canadian province which has its own
immigration laws , has had two business immigration schemes in force since
1986 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#112:7>
The entrepreneur scheme requires an immigrant to invest
C&dollar;200,000 &obrack; HK&dollar;1.22 million &cbrack; and create three
jobs in the province , while the investor scheme calls for an investment of
C&dollar;350,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#113:7>
Last year , 45,000 people emigrated to Quebec , of which 53 per
cent were businessmen and professionals.

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#114:7>
Among the businessmen , about one-third joined the investor scheme .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#115:7>
The Quebec Government  ' s director of immigration service in
Hongkong , Mr Pierre Danis , said more than 4,000 Hongkong people emigrated
to the province last year , with about one-sixth doing do under the
investment scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#116:7>
The total figure was higher than usual because of a backlog.

<ICE-HK:W2C-003#117:7>
On average , 2,500 moved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#118:7>
Quebec  ' s Minister of Cultural Communities and Immigration , Mrs
Monique Gagnon-Tremblay , said that while the rate of retention for the
entrepreneur scheme was as high as 75 per cent , that for the investor scheme
was below 50 per cent , although she did not have the exact figures . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#119:7>
She said the low retention rate was possibly because the scheme
was a passive one and immigrants only had to put their money in investment
funds . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#120:7>
Some Hongkong immigrants were also returning to the territory
because the province had gone through a recession and people wanted to take
advantage of the booming economy in southern China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#121:7>
Mrs Gagnon-Tremblay , who is on a trip to the territory to see
how the scheme can be improved , said she had found that potential migrants
wanted more flexibility from the scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#122:7>
Results of a government study of the schemes may be completed
this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#123:7>
Mr Danis also revealed that the number of people applying to
emigrate to Quebec for the first four months of this year was only about half
the figure for last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#124:7>
His office received only 200 applications from January to April
, while 400 applications were received in the same period last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#125:7>
&ldquo; When the Hang Seng Index goes up , the number of
applications goes down, &rdquo; Mr Danis said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#126:7>
He believed that other major immigration destinations for
Hongkong people , like the United States and Australia , had also experienced
a drop in applications from the territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-003#127:7>
But interest in Quebec elsewhere &dash; in South Korea and
Taiwan , for example &dash; had stayed at the same level . </p> </I>
