<ICE-HK:S1A-040#20:1:A>
Now that become a teacher <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#21:1:A>
But how did you torture me how did you torture my <,> my fellow <,>
schoolmates <,> I forgotten <{4> <[4> <,,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#22:1:A>
<{5> <[5> And also </[5> maybe because I meant I mean because I
<,,> I was a very very <,> obedient <,> <{6> <[6> pupil </[6> <{7> <[7> <,>
</[7> so <,,> I have I  ' ve I have not been tortured <{8> <[8> <,> and </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X30:1:Z>
<[8> Right <,> and </[8> </{8> possibly this <.> disci </.> the
the kind of discipline area moves that the teacher had to make <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X31:1:Z>
We  ' re not <,> clear to you because they weren't <,> direct

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X39:1:Z>
Right that scare quotes <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X40:1:Z>
What <.> wr </.> wrong because because it  ' s not like what

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#41:1:A>
<[1> Yeah <,> yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#42:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

But we <,> but but there <,> there must must be ways <,> to <,> to
give them the the right signal <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> I mean I <,> I don't want
to be the kind of <,,> you know autocrat <,> autocratic teacher you know <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#49:1:A>
Just giving out orders and and you have to listen to me because I

$A and

$Z laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X57:1:Z>
You did really is it <{2> <[2> <unc> several words </unc>
</[2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#58:1:A>
<[1> How </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#59:1:A>
<[2> I mean so </[2> </{2> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#60:1:A>
Now that that some of them <,> had had said that you know <,,> you  ' re
very strange <,> you <,> you speak like a non-Chinese <,> but you are a
Chinese <,> how could you speak like a non-Chinese

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#61:1:A>
And then and then they and then they go somewhere else and then say
<,> oh nineteen ninety <,> seven is approaching <,> do you think the English
is still be so important <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#62:1:A>
I mean they <{1> <[1> were writing </[1> I mean I mean this very
student <,> uh was writing under the topic of my new English teacher <,>
something like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#63:1:A>
<{2> <[2> And then go </[2> to nineteen ninety seven issue

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X64:1:Z>
<[1> <unc> several words </unc> </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X65:1:Z>
<[2> <unc> two words </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X66:1:Z>
Wow <,,> good <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X67:1:Z>
Oh good brilliant well done <&>

$A laughs </&> <unc> two words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X68:1:Z>
I guess they expected an A or something and what

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X69:1:Z>
Do you think that they  ' re <,> are they playing game and response
to like oh you make me do this exercise I  ' m going to <,> I  ' m going to make
a <,> a game out of it and the game will suit me <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X70:1:Z>
You know like <,> okay the teacher can can make me do this task
that I  ' m not use to doing <,> and so in <.> re </.> in response I  ' m just
going to <,> uhm you know <{1> <[1> write something </[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X71:1:Z>
<{2> <[2> Yeah screw up in some way </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X72:1:Z>
Yeah basically just sort of make it <,> not necessary make
mistakes but I will take advantage of the fact that I can say anything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#73:1:A>
<[1> Screw it up </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#74:1:A>
<[2> <unc> several words </unc> </[2> </{2>
#> Oh yes they they do <,> they do take advantage of of this

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#75:1:A>
Because someone had <,> someone had <,> really put down you know
like <,,> me <,,> do put effort <,> in doing this <,> weekly journal and you
did nothing

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#76:1:A>
You didn't <,> give us any feedback <{1 > <[1> <,,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#77:1:A>
And then <{2> <,,> <[2> </[2> to respond to that <,> I gave them a
I I gave this this girl a full page <,> of my feedback for her latest work
<{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#78:1:A>
I meant I  ' m always ready to write I mean I like writing I have
this passion in writing <{4> <[4> <,,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#79:1:A>
First of all <,> I mean the problem is first

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#80:1:A>
I wonder <,> whether they they understand my English <{5> <[5> <,,>
</[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#81:1:A>
And and second <,,> is is really wasting their <,> their own <,,>
book <,> I mean I mean their exercise book

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X82:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X83:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X84:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X85:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X86:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X87:1:Z>
Because you  ' re just filling it <{> <[> up </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#88:1:A>
<[> <.> be </.> </[> </{> because I <,> yes <{1> <[1> <,,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#89:1:A>
And and it in reply to that <,> this girl said <,> don't worry <,>
you can write what <,,> what whatever you want

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#90:1:A>
Don't don't worry about the space

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#91:1:A>
<{2> I <[2> </[2> have enough space for you <{3> <[3> <,,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#92:1:A>
So they just want to get the teacher do something else

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#93:1:A>
I mean I mean do something in <,,> in accordance <,> I mean

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X94:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X95:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X96:1:Z>
<[3> God </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X97:1:Z>
You know I  ' ve I  ' ve heard is that <,> it  ' s more important to get
the students I I I kind just hear at the university that <,> it  ' s actually
<,> in fact it  ' s more important to get the students to write and to speak
than it is for them to get the feedback of the teacher because it is the
action of writing and speaking and trying to make sense out of things <,>
that actually forms the basis of the education

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X98:1:Z>
It  ' s not whoever not the teacher tells them that they had the
right answer or that it was good and that was bad

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X99:1:Z>
Because they don't <,> I mean maybe they read the comments but
they don't necessarily understand the comments in the way that they  ' re <{1>
<[1> <,,> </[1> <{2> <[2> that  ' s it </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X100:1:Z>
Do you think is that true or </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#101:1:A>
<[1> Oh that  ' s they </[1> </{1> <[2> <?> test it </?> </[2>
</{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#102:1:A>
I <unc> several words </unc> they they they they just <.>
mis </.> misread the comments

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#103:1:A>
I mean one of them even put put the comments back on onto their
corrections

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#104:1:A>
They think <{1> <[1> is </[1> <,,> is part of <,> part of the
correction <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#105:1:A>
<{3> <[3> Because </[3> <,,> I mean like maybe I I put a <mention>
good </mention> at the end and then they put a <mention> good </mention>
after the end of of their <{4> <[4> <&>

$A and

$Z laugh <,> right </[4> <&>

$A and

$Z laugh </&> of their corrections <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#106:1:A>
<.> Some </.> something like that <{6> <[6> <unc> several
words </unc> </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X107:1:Z>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X108:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X109:1:Z>
<[3> Right </[3> </{3> <[4> <&>

$Z laughs </&> </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X110:1:Z>
<[5> Right </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X111:1:Z>
<[6> Oh maybe I hear a </[6> </{6> bad story

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X112:1:Z>
Good <&>

$A and

$Z laugh </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#113:1:A>
May may maybe I  ' ll I  ' ll put some <unc> two words
</unc> symbols like <,> you know oh this is not my <,> my experience is
from <,> from my my friend

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#114:1:A>
She is only <,> a she is also a teacher <,> and she said <,> she
once put <,> A R T meaning article <{> <[> <,,> </[> in <.> be </.> in
between two two words <,> and this student put that <mention> art </mention>
<&>

$A and

$Z laugh </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X115:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X116:1:Z>
Oh god <,> yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#117:1:A>
<.> Some </.> something like that would <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>
<{2> <[2> <unc> several words </unc> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#118:1:A>
But <,> but it  ' s better than nothing because some of them really
care about the the comments <{3> <[3> <,,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#119:1:A>
So <,> I mean if they they are not about to to read novels or
whatever just read my <,> my cheap stuff I mean <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#120:1:A>
I  ' m not writing a a novel here I  ' m writing you <,> something

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#121:1:A>
I  ' ll use words that I feel comfortable with <,> and <{5> <[5>
there are words </[5> that they don't feel comfortable with

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#122:1:A>
So they do have to go to check up with dictionary <{6> <[6> <,,>
</[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#123:1:A>
So in <,> in that sense <,> I mean feedback is positive <{7> <[7>
<,> </[7> and I don't mind doing that <,> <{8> <[8> especially </[8> because
I <,> I like writing I mean the only thing is time <{9> <[9> <,> </[9>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#124:1:A>
I don't have the time to <,> to you know to write a page for every
student

<$Z> <X> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X125:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X154:1:Z>
We were talking about staying after <.> sc </.> <,> staying after
school <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X155:1:Z>
And then you said one of my most traumatic experiences <,> and

hours non-stop <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#160:1:A>
Because I had <,,> I had no recess I had no lunch I <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#161:1:A>
Because I <,> every recess some some student will come down and
ask me something

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#162:1:A>
<{3> <[3> I make them </[3> to do I make them do that <{4> <[4>
<,,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#163:1:A>
Because <,> I always you know put some see me <,> you know at <,>
at their books you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#164:1:A>
Sometimes I don't understand or <,> their sentences <{5> <[5>
sometimes </[5> <,> I  ' m going to see them because of their handwritings I
cannot read their handwritings <{6> <[6> <,> </[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#165:1:A>
Sometimes because <,> they make the same mistake over and over
again I want to <,> see why <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#166:1:A>
So <,> I have no rest so <,> on that very day I work for twelve
hours non-stop <{8> <[8> <,> </[8>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#167:1:A>
I I  ' m not sure <,> maybe I have <,> I haven't eaten at all

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#168:1:A>

rest

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#169:1:A>
For for most of the days <,> I  ' ve <,> no break <,> <{10> <[10> no
break </[10>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#170:1:A>
So I mean after school someone will come down to me and <,> and
<,,> and give give me the diary and I have to <,> I have to <,> mark it in
front of her <,> and <,,> she  ' ll ask me some questions about about what I  ' ve
taught because she is a slow learner

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#171:1:A>
And I  ' m <,> I  ' m I  ' m more than prepared to <,> to be her <,>
private tutor I mean in some sense <{11> <[11> <,> </[11> because I  ' ve been
giving her <.> s </.> special attention because of her special case

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X172:1:Z>
<[1> Ah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X173:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X178:1:Z>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X179:1:Z>

<[11> Uhm uhm </[11> </{11>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X183:1:Z>
Why is this student special case </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-040#184:1:A>
She is living in Fanling <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#185:1:A>
So <,> she has she has to go to to Shang Wan <,> everyday <,> you
know like very early <,> at five I don't know at five <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#186:1:A>
And <,> she has this very peculiar <,,> uh habit

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#187:1:A>
She has she has to listen to some <,> some uhm <,> <indig> gwok
</indig> <.> Aa </.> Aaron Kwok song <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> before going to bed

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#188:1:A>
<{4> <[4> And she </[4> insists on going to bed at ten <,> so she
had barely any time to <,> to do any revision to read any <,> newspaper you
know I ask them to read Young Post she has no time <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>
<unc> one word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#189:1:A>
Okay <,,> you  ' ve now that now that you  ' ve told me all your all
your troubles why not <,> give me <,> and give yourself thirty minutes after
school right after school you come down everyday <{6> <[6> <,,> </[6> so <,>

English <,> <{7> <[7> for </[7> thirty <.> se </.> thirty minutes <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#190:1:A>
So that means <,> this <.> stu </.> student will <,> persistently
come down to me at that hour <{8> <[8> <,> </[8> to <,,> to <,> cure her <,>
<{9> <[9> her her her </[9> English

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#293:1:A>
So <{5> <[5> <,,> </[5> you don't have to have <,> a very

</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-040#X334:1:Z>

is your view about <,> Latin because you were <,> we were kind of <,> talking
about the political status of English and the way students sometimes write
things like nineteen ninety seven or something <&>

$A laughs <,> as if that was the date at which <,> all English shall shall
end or cease to be relevant <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>
