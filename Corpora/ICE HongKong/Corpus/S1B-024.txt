Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#2:1:A>
In our programme this evening we take a look at Sino-British
relations in the <?> wake </?> of Mr Lu Ping  ' s visit <,> and the meeting in
Hong Kong of the PWC

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#3:1:A>
Then in part two of this programme we take a look at Mr Patten  ' s
political package uh Human Right Commission and what might happen to the
airport proposals

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#4:1:A>
Joining us in the studio are Mr Tsang Yuk Sing a member of DAB Mr
James Tien a member of the Liberal Party and Mr Yeung Sum a member of the
UDHK

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#5:1:A>
Well gentlemen we live in extraordinary times uh my first question
is <{> <[> put </[> to all three of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#6:1:A>
And that is how would you characterize the state of Sino-British
relations at this junction

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#7:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#8:1:C>
<{> <[> Tense

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#9:1:C>
Every </[> everyone everyone can can see that <,> Lu Ping came to
Hong Kong and he refused to see Mr Patten that is of course uh very uh uh
very significant uh uh sign <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#10:1:C>
Uhm we hope that the relationship uhm <,> is actually it has come
to the bottom of of the trough

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#11:1:C>
We hope that it is it it will improve uh in the next few months or
so

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#12:1:C>
But uhm <,> uhm I think we have to wait for some time yet

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#13:1:A>
<[> <unc> one-word </unc> <?> well </?> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#14:1:A>
Uhm James do you agree with that

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#15:1:D>
Uhm I would say perfectly <,> absolutely

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#16:1:D>
As ever since I entered politics at around eighty four and signing
of the Joint Declaration I would say the the the situation right now is the
worst that that I  ' ve ever seen <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#17:1:D>
Uh it  ' s quite a in in <,> unimaginable that uhm <,> Director Lu
Ping comes in would not even meet uh Christopher uhm Patten our governor uh
even for a handshake or have a short talk about what things are about Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#18:1:D>
<{> <[> That  ' s why all the Hong Kong people are worry </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#19:1:A>
<[> Worse than what it was after </[> </{> June Fourth

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#20:1:D>
No I would say so

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#21:1:A>
Yeung Sum

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#22:1:B>
I I think Mr Tsang has used the word tense to describe the
nature or the kind of relationship between two government

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#23:1:B>
Obviously it is true <,> but I just hope that they can be more
rational and mature enough not to spread this kind of relationship for too
long

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#24:1:B>
And things like building the airport it is of mutual interest

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#25:1:B>
And it is particularly to the interest of people in Hong Kong
because the British government will end the rule <,> uh three years later you
know

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#26:1:B>
The later the airport built you know and the more expensive it  ' ll
become

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#27:1:B>
So I don't see why they have this kind of <unc> one-word
</unc> over the politics <,> should be <.> ex </.> spread to other fields

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#28:1:C>
<{1> <[1> Well but </[1> judging from what what has happened
in past couple years

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#29:1:C>
Especially <,> uh judging from the uhm FAC report uh released early
<{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#30:1:C>
There was a revision <,> in British policy on Hong Kong and towards
China after June Fourth

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#31:1:C>
Uh <,> and especially after uhm Mr Patten arrived as Governor of
Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#32:1:C>
I think China is now revising her policy towards Hong Kong and
towards uh uh Britain

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#33:1:C>
Uhm China came to the conclusion after the breakdown of
Sino-British uh election talks <,> towards the end of last year

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#34:1:C>
China came to the conclusion that it is impossible to rely the
British for a smooth transition to nineteen ninety seven so this <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#35:1:C>
I think this means uhm uhm uhm very <,> uhm significant change in
uhm how China formulate her policy on Hong Kong

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#36:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#37:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#38:1:A>
This is to be expected but of course this does not mean in the
words of Mr Qian Qi Shen that in other areas the two sides cannot cooperate
just because they <{1> <[1> are </[1> arguing with each other on <{2> <[2>
the </[2> political package

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#39:1:A>
<{3> <[3> Doesn't </[3> mean they can't cooperate on the airport on
uh cross boarder smuggling and that sort of affairs

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#40:1:D>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#41:1:D>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#42:1:D>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#43:1:C>
I think both sides want to cooperate but with mutual trust
lacking

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#44:1:C>
Uh I think simple things simple matters would become complicated
and complicated matters would simply become uh insolvable

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#45:1:B>
<{> <[> I think they </[> can build up the bridge over the gap
by <,> by having the interest of people in Hong Kong in their mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#46:1:B>
I mean just like the airport or the economic <?> cooperations </?>
or or the security uhm measures you know all over the border or the traffic
over the border

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#47:1:B>
I mean if both government put the interest of people in Hong Kong
in their mind I think <,> the gap can be <?> bridge </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#48:1:A>
<[> Uhm uh </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#49:1:D>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#50:1:A>
One of the first <{1> <[1> causalities </[1> of this state of
tension <{2> <[2> in </[2> Sino-British relations is of course the demise of
the through train

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#51:1:A>
I mean <{3> <[3> this </[3> is not going to happen anymore

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#52:1:A>
Uh James was your party disappointed that even a partial through
train which was the concept <,> <{4> <[4> which </[4> you talked about <,>
could not now be sustained

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#53:1:D>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#54:1:D>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#55:1:B>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#56:1:D>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#57:1:D>
Very <,> in fact in the last week we had a chance to see uh Lu Ping
for a couple of times <,> both at the business parties uh luncheon with him

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#58:1:D>
And as a Hong Kong advisor <,> and we kept emphasizing that uh if
we could uh amend the current ninety three uh nine ninety two proposal on
electoral uh reform to somewhat closer to the uh Basic law

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#59:1:D>
Would there a chance of if not a total through train at least a
partial uh through <{1> <[1> train and I would say <?> Liberal </[1> </?>
Party <{2> <[2> was very </[2> disappointed

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#60:1:D>
They  ' re they  ' re saying that whatever we do <,> uh everyone gets
up the train and uh we  ' d have to be reelected again uh in ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#61:1:D>
Of course their difference of saying that <,> uh if the uh form of
election is correct <{3> <[3> then </[3> the candidate can always
re-participate and get yourself reelected

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#62:1:D>
But that certainly is not our thinking of some kind of a through
train

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#63:1:D>
<{4> <[4> Our </[4> kind of through train is <{5> <[5> you </[5>
are elected by ninety five you could stay on to uh nineteen ninety nine and
not really get off and reelect again

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#64:1:D>
<{6> <[6> We  ' re </[6> using the argument if you  ' re <?> electable
</?> in ninety five you should be <?> electable </?> again in ninety seven

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#65:1:A>
<[1> Uhm and the answer was no </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#66:1:C>
<[2> Yeah no </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#67:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#68:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#69:1:A>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#70:1:A>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#71:1:A>
Uhm <unc> one-word </unc> the through train of course does
not only cover <,> <{1> <[1> legislators and </[1> uh urban <{2> <[2>
councillors and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#72:1:A>
It </[2> also refers to the civil service and this is one area <{3>
<[3> where </[3> a lot of people are really concerned

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#73:1:A>
Especially civil <{4> <[4> servants </[4> uhm why is China taking
such <{5> <[5> a tough </[5> stance on that Mr <{6> <[6> <?> Tsang </?>
</[6>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#74:1:D>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#75:1:D>
<[2> No <unc> two-words </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#76:1:D>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#77:1:D>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#78:1:C>
<[5> No </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#79:1:C>
<[6> I </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#80:1:C>
No I don't think there  ' re any problem with uh <,> with the
transition of civil of of the civil service

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#81:1:C>
<{1> <[1> Well </[1> uh of course the Basic Law require us that uhm
for the uhm senior <,> posts in the civil service they have to be <,>
nominated by the uh Chief Executive and appointed by the Central Government
<{2> <[2> that that </[2> is the Basic Law right

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#82:1:C>
But for <,> the the majority for for the bulk of the civil service
I don't think China has has at any time <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> uhm uhm raised
any hints that uhm they cannot take the so called through train

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#83:1:C>
Through train simply isn't a problem isn't an issue in in the civil
service

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#84:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#85:1:A>
<[2> And that </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#86:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#87:1:A>
<{> <[> But in </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#88:1:D>
<[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#89:1:B>
It  ' s interesting about the concept of through train because
in the past we just told that uh <,> some people are labelled as being
subversive

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#90:1:B>
So they can cannot take on the through train

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#91:1:B>
And now that it seem the Chinese government expand the concept <,>
that all three tiers you know the <,> legislature <.> coun </.> uh Urban
Council and then the District Board has to be disbanded and reelection will
have to take place

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#92:1:B>
So <,> it doesn't just hit on a few few people <{> <[> <,> you know
yeah </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#93:1:C>
<[> But I don't think I don't think </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#94:1:C>
I I think think the uh concept through train only <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#95:1:C>
It has always only applied to the Legislative Council <{1> <[1> <,>
because because if there  ' s nobody </[1> talk about through train in other
areas <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> but <{3> <[3> we </[3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#96:1:B>
<[1> No it  ' s yes it  ' s expensive now </[1> </{1>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#97:1:D>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#98:1:A>
<[3> If </[3> </{3> that is the case why <,> why does China
want to disband every single <{> <[> structure </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#99:1:D>
<[> <?> But </?> </[> </{> that  ' s <{1> <[1> set up </[1> for
the civil servant

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#100:1:D>
Actually my view on the civil servant <,> is that we don't have
much to worry about

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#101:1:D>
Cause right now all they  ' re saying is that it  ' s no longer <,> uh
uh what the civil servant act

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#102:1:D>
It  ' s it  ' s rather simply pro-governor or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#103:1:D>
If you listen to the governor so you will be today  ' s sort of uh
high flyer then they  ' ll throw you off the train <{2> <[2> and they think
there  ' s enough </[2> for the civil servant <{3> <[3> uh uh </[3>
qualifications <{4> <[4> in </[4> in Hong Kong that if the top tiers that go
now

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#104:1:D>
They can easy find replacement and probably my personal feeling is
that we do have the depth in our civil services <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> in a
director grade or the assistant secretary grade or the deputy uh grade that
that will not be a major problem for us <{6> <[6> in </[6> the civil service

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#105:1:C>
<[1> I </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#106:1:B>
<[2> Is it someone said that </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#107:1:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#108:1:A>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#109:1:A>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#110:1:A>
<[6> In </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#111:1:A>
Is this an attempt to undermine the credibility of the governor
and his ability to govern

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#112:1:A>
I mean if that is the case that is bad enough in it is in uh in
itself <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> <{2> <[2> as it is </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#113:1:C>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#114:1:D>
<[2> <unc> one-word </unc> I think </[2> </{2> there  ' s
some truth in that <,> uh statement

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#115:1:D>
Well because if you say that you support fully the political
reform of uh Governor Patten today

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#116:1:D>
Then obviously that is against uh what China  ' s interpretation of
the Basic Law are

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#117:1:D>
And therefore the after ninety seven uh either you  ' ll have to
wait and see or they will replace with someone who may be equally capable

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#118:1:A>
Then we have a political problem because the Sino-British
Joint Declaration <{1> <[1> specifically said </[1> that the administration
of Hong Kong <{2> <[2> all </[2> the way to nineteen ninety seven is the
responsibility of the British <{3> <[3> Government </[3>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#119:1:D>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#120:1:D>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#121:1:C>
<[3> So it is </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#122:1:C>
<{1> <[1> So it is </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#123:1:C>
I actually I I  ' m not worry about the uhm civil service at all

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#124:1:C>
Now if a senior civil servant <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> uhm <,> is now
doing his his or her job competently and seen by the public <,> as doing a
good job

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#125:1:C>
I don't think <,> the Chinese or or or the new SAR government will
throw him or her <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> out of his his <{4> <[4> his or her
</[4> post

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#126:1:C>
I don't I don't think that <{5> <[5> alright </[5>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#127:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#128:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#129:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#130:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#131:1:B>
<[5> But Mr </[5> </{5> Tsang has seem is that someone from
the Chinese government that they have to declare the <{> <[> loyalty </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#132:1:C>
<[> No </[> </{> no no <{> <[> no no </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#133:1:B>
<[> Is it </[> </{> a rumour

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#134:1:C>
No

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#135:1:C>
It is in in a very inaccurate report <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#136:1:C>
That  ' s the problem with the uh with the PWC

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#137:1:C>
<{2> <[2> On </[2> one hand people want PWC to uh <,> to to hold
the their discussions in the open

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#138:1:C>
<{3> <[3> They </[3> want to know <,> uh <,> uh what actually
takes place <{4> <[4> during </[4> the PWC meeting

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#139:1:C>
But <,> the PWC of course is a working <,> uh uh group

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#140:1:C>
<{5> <[5> It is </[5> a working body it has to look into the all
the possible problems and to and to find solutions

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#141:1:C>
So it is nature for members of the PWC to ask questions like well
how can we assure <,> that the uh civil service posts will all be <{6> <[6>
uh </[6> filled in nineteen ninety seven <{7> <[7> <,> </[7>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#142:1:C>
How can we assure that uh we won't have uh a mass <?> excer </?>
exodus of <{8> <[8> of </[8> civil servants <{9> <[9> from </[9> Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#143:1:C>
<{10> <[10> Now </[10> although it is very unlikely <{11> <[11>
they have to uhm they have to ask et cetera </[11>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#144:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#145:1:B>

<[11> Then even if we talk about certain civil </[11> </{11>
servants being unacceptable

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#155:1:D>
<{1> <[1> Don't </[1> you think that the most that we could talk
about is a handful

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#156:1:D>
<{2> <[2> No more </[2> than three four or five

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#157:1:D>
We  ' re not talking about <{3> <[3> <,> hundreds </[3> or <{4> <[4>
even tens </[4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#158:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#159:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#160:1:C>
<[3> I don't think </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#161:1:B>
<[4> <unc> one-word </unc> tens </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#162:1:B>
<{1> <[1> E even so we </[1> should we shouldn't label a few isn't
it

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#163:1:B>
<{2> <[2> I mean by </[2> labeling a few that they are not
friendly to the Chinese government it just hit upon the <{3> <[3> moral
<unc> one-word </unc> yeah </[3>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#164:1:C>
<[1> I don't think any </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#165:1:C>
<[2> No no </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#166:1:C>
<[3> Exactly exactly </[3> </{3> and I <{> <[> think </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#167:1:D>
<[> The </[> </{> top civil servants <{1> <[1> might just
</[1> carry out the instruction of the governor that  ' s our feel that  ' s my
feeling <{2> <[2> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#168:1:D>
But <?> still </?> may not be their personal feeling </[2> but if
the instruction is such such from <{3> <[3> governor </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#169:1:D>
They will just do it so it not it may not <{4> <[4> be </[4> their
personal view

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#170:1:B>
<[1> We shouldn't </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#171:1:C>
<[2> But I think I think the Chinese government </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#172:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#173:1:B>
<[4> Sure </[4> </{4>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#174:1:C>
Sure exactly

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#175:1:B>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#176:1:C>
So I I  ' m sure the uh the the Chinese government especially
the senior officials have been careful <{1> <[1> not </[1> to label <{2> <[2>
in individual </[2> civil uh servant <{3> <[3> as </[3> well uh <{4> <[4>
unacceptable </[4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#177:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#178:1:B>
<[2> Yeah so so </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#179:1:B>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#180:1:B>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#181:1:D>
True

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#182:1:D>
So far they haven't specifically said <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> many
many <{2> <[2> names </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#183:1:B>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#184:1:B>
<[2> No </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#185:1:A>
<[2> Alright </[2> </{2> let me pick you up <,> on another
point <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#186:1:A>
You said Mr Tsang that you are not worried about the civil
service

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#187:1:A>
Now that suggests that you are worried about the three tiers
structure because Mr Lu has said you know this will be dismantled in
nineteen ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#188:1:A>
As you said the through train referred to Legislative Councillors
so why did China extend this dismantling exercise to the Urban Council <.>
Min </.> Municipal Council and and the District <{> <[> Broad </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#189:1:C>
<[> Well </[> </{> why why did the why did the British agree
to talk to China <,> about the ninety four election as well

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#190:1:C>
If it was only the ninety five Legco election that was in question

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#191:1:C>
So obviously there had to be agreements between the two
governments on all three tiers for the for this smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1B-024#192:1:C>
Now I I <,> I don't think the term uhm disbanding or dismantling
uh is appropriate at all to describe the state of <?> affairs </?> happening
<{> <[> in ninety seven </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-024#193:1:A>
<[> How would you </[> </{> describe it </I>
