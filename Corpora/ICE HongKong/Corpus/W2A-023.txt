<ICE-HK:W2A-023#11:1>
<bold> Main outcome measures . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#12:1>
Common referral diagnoses according to sources of referral .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#13:1>
<bold> Results . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#14:1>
The common sources of referral were maternal and child health centers
( 34.7&percent; &cbrack; , accident and emergency departments &obrack;  26.9&percent; &cbrack; , the
Student Health Service &obrack;  12.9&percent; &cbrack; , private pracitioners &obrack; 
10.5&percent; &cbrack; , and general out-patients clinics &obrack;  9.8&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#15:1>
The common referral diagnoses from maternal and child health centers
( n=689 &cbrack; were growth problems &obrack;  37.7&percent; &cbrack; , heart murmurs &obrack; 
16.8&percent; &cbrack; , and neonatal jaundice &obrack;  10.9&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#16:1>
Asthma or suspected asthma constituted the majority of referrals from
accident and emergency departments &obrack;  227/533; 4206&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#17:1>
Deviations in growth &obrack;  41.4&percent; &cbrack; , problems regarding puberty &obrack; 
13.7&percent; &cbrack; , apparent heart problems &obrack;  13.3&percent; &cbrack; , and nocturnal
enuresis &obrack;  11.7&percent; &cbrack; were the common referral diagnoses from the Student
Health Service &obrack;  n=256 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#18:1>
<bold> Conclusion . </bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#19:1>
Studying referral patterns from various sources is helpful in
organising medical health services and identifying training needs . </p> <h>
<bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#20:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#21:1>
The specialist out-patient clinic represents a significant
portion of the workload of paediatric services in regional hospitals in Hong
Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#22:1>
The majority of attendances are previous cases that have established
diagnoses and treatment plans .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#23:1>
The impact of new cases should not be ignored , as the time spent on
a new case could be two to three times that of an old case .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#24:1>
Reducing the waiting time for new cases has always been a concern of
the community , the Hospital Authority , and specialists in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#25:1>
Knowledge of the referral patterns to specialist put-patient clinics
facilitates better planning of out-patient services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#26:1>
Conversely , the referring parties will be able to identify their
training needs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#27:1>
The referral pattern also provides some background information to all
parties concerned , so that medical care is delivered more effectively and
efficiently .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#28:1>
These improvements are particularly important now , when resources
for health care are limited . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#29:1>
Methods </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#30:1>
All referral letters received in 1998 by the paediatric
specialist clinic of the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital &obrack;  PYNEH)
were included in this study .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#31:1>
All letters were screened initially by a nurse and subsequently by a
doctor to enable an appointment to be given at the appropriate subsequently
clinic at the appropriate time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#32:1>
During the screening , referral diagnoses and sources of referral
were recorded for later analysis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#33:1>
Relatively uncommon referral diagnoses &obrack;  including surgical or
dermatological problems &cbrack; that did not fall into the common categories were
classified as  ' others ' .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#34:1>
For cases with multiple problems , only the most important was
included for analysis . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#35:1>
Results </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#36:1>
A total of 1985 referral letters were received over the 1-year
study period .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#37:1>
The sources of referral in descending order of frequency were
maternal and child health centers &obrack;  MCHCs &cbrack; &obrack;  34.7&percent; &cbrack; , accident and
emergency departments &obrack;  26.9&percent; &cbrack; , the Student Health Service &obrack; 
12.9&percent; &cbrack; , private practitioners &obrack;  10.5&percent; &cbrack; , general out-patient
clinics &obrack;  9.8&percent; &cbrack; , and other specialties or <O> Table </O> paediatric
department &obrack;  5.2&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#38:1>
The referral diagnoses from the first five sources are shown in
Tables 1 to 5 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#39:1>
The three most common diagnoses for MCHC referrals were growth
problems &obrack;  mainly deviations from standard growth charts &cbrack; , heart murmurs ,
and neonatal jaundice &obrack;  Table 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#40:1>
Known cases of asthma or suspected asthma in the form of cough or
wheeze constituted 42.6&percent; of all referrals from accident and emergency
departments &obrack;  Table 2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#41:1>
For referrals from the Student Health Service , deviations from
standard growth curves &obrack;  particularly obesity and shortness &cbrack; were the most
common reasons for referral &obrack;  Table 3 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#42:1>
Other reasons included precocious puberty , heart murmur , and
nocturnal enuresis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#43:1>
The patterns of referral from private practitioners &obrack;  Table 4 &cbrack; and
general out-patient clinics &obrack;  Table 5 &cbrack; were similar , and the common referral
diagnoses were asthma or cough , and neurological and cardiac problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#44:1>
The referrals from all sources <O> Table </O> are summarized in Table
6 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#45:1>
Overall , the most common reasons for referral were related to growth
( 20.5&percent; &cbrack; , respiration &obrack;  17.4&percent; &cbrack; , and the heart &obrack; 
11.9&percent; &cbrack; . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#46:1>
Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#47:1>
Because this study was based on the contents of referral letters
, it was not possible to tell whether the referral diagnoses were
substantiated or whether the referrals were justified .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#48:1>
Nevertheless , the study reflects the practice of the various sources
of referral and provides information that can be used to improve referral
procedures and staff training .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#49:1>
No previous <O> Three tables </O> descriptive accounts of local
referral patterns to paediatric specialist clinic could be found in the
literature to compare the results of this study . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#50:1>
Referrals from maternal and child health centers </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#51:1>
The MCHC services are provided by the Department of Health .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#52:1>
Each child receives a physical check-up in the first month of life ,
and again at 2 years and 5 years of age .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#53:1>
A large number of normal children are seen at the MCHCs and ,
inevitably , a range of nor-mal variation is encountered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#54:1>
A large proportion of the referrals from MCHCs may in fact be normal
variations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#55:1>
A large proportion of infants and children &obrack;  22.6&percent; &cbrack; were
referred to the paediatric specialist clinic because of problems that were
related to head size or shape , anterior fontanelle size , time of closure of
the anterior fontanelle , and the presence of any bony prominence on the
skull .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#56:1>
The size of time of closure of the anterior fontanelle very greatly:
most paediatric textbooks state that the size varies at birth , decreases by
<O> Table </O> 6 months of age , and closes by 12 to 18 months .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#57:1>
In a study of 704 Chinese babies from birth to age 24 months, <sp> 1
</sp> the mean longitudinal and transverse diameters of the anterior
fontanelle remained the same in the first 4 months of life and ranged from9mm
to 42mm .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#58:1>
The diameters became smaller by aged 6 months , but was still patent
in 15&percent; and 8&percent; of babies at age 18 months and 24 months ,
respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#59:1>
The doctor performing the screening examination should take note of
this wide range of normality .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#60:1>
While deviations in size and time of closure of the anterior
fontanelle may be a feature in some rare conditions such as hypothyroidism ,
skeletal abnormalities , hydrocephalus , and cranial synostosis , these
conditions are unlikely when head growth is normal and other physical signs
are absent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#61:1>
In addition , although head size is usually proportional to body
build , the head may be disproportionately big or small without any
pathological reason .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#62:1>
Serial measurements are thus definitely more useful than
single-point measurements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#63:1>
Special medical attention is required for babies with a head
circumference that crosses centiles or is at or below three standard
deviations from the mean . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#64:1>
Failure to thrive , poor growth , shortness , or smallness were
common referral diagnoses &obrack;  64/689;9.3&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#65:1>
In general , children were refereed to the paediatric clinic for
unsatisfactory weight gain if the body weight was close to the third centile .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#66:1>
Many of them were normal healthy small-build children with a
length/height that was also close to the third centile; one or both parents
may also be short .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#67:1>
Serial measurements are again essential .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#68:1>
Referral to a specialist is recommended if the curve crosses two
centiles &obrack;  or one centile for a young child &cbrack; of if a single measurement lies
at or below three standard deviation. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#69:1>
In contrast , some apparently healthy infants were referred for
crossing down weight centiles in the early months of life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#70:1>
These were usually infants with a satisfactory birhtweight , but who
subsequently had a reduced growth rate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#71:1>
Birthweight is dependent on maternal and intrauterine factors ,
whereas genetic factors determine the growth potential after birth. <sp> 2
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#72:1>
An awareness of such a phenomenon alleviates parental anxiety and
reduces unnecessary investigations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#73:1>
Heart murmur was a common reason &obrack;  116/689:16.8&percent; &cbrack; for
referral , but only one fifth of infants were later found to have structural
or functional abnormalities of the heart .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#74:1>
Heart murmur are present in as high as 50&percent; of normal children
and most of the murmurs are innocent. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#75:1>
Hence , doctors performing the screening examination should
concentrate on individuals with symptoms such as cardiopulmonary distress and
obvious murmurs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#76:1>
This practice , however , may be difficult for doctors who have had
no training in cardiology .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#77:1>
The specialist clinic should try to minimise the waiting time for
referrals of infant with cardiac problems , because it is very difficult to
identify urgent cases from reading the referral letters only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#78:1>
The PYNEH arranges for newborns with heart murmurs to be seen at the
cardiac clinic as soon as possible because these infants are the most
vulnerable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#79:1>
Many babies &obrack;  75/689; 10.9&percent; &cbrack; were referred to the
paediatric clinic because of jaundice that extended beyond the first 2 weeks
of life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#80:1>
Breast-milk jaundice is a benign condition , but some diagnostic
investigations are usually performed to differentiate it from non-benign
conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#81:1>
Under the present system , cases of paediatric jaundice that are
detected in the MCHC are referred to the hospital accident and emergency
department or paediatric specialist clinic for further management .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#82:1>
This practice had been adopted for many years , but it is not
necessarily the best arrangement: parents usually find it difficult to make
multiple visits to the hospital and MCHC .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#83:1>
One of the reasons for the referral is that doctors in MCHCs have
limited access to facilitates to perform laboratory investigations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#84:1>
Despite this limitation , doctors in MCHCs see a large numbers of
babies with jaundice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#85:1>
A jaundice meter that measures the degree of yellowness of the skin
is frequently used to estimate the degree of jaundice , because readings
correlate well with the serum bilirubin level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#86:1>
A blood sample can be taken if the reading is above a certain level ,
depending on the baby  ' s race and basal skin colour. <sp> 4 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#87:1>
Studies in Chinese infants have shown that most newborns with serum
bilirubin concentrations above 221 mmol/L can be identified by using the
jaundice meter , which gives a reading of > 20. <sp> 5,6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#88:1>
However , it is unreliable to diagnose mild jaundice by using only
the jaundice meter reading and the use of the meter for such a purpose has
not been recommended .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#89:1>
For example , a reading of 15 on the forehead may correspond to a
serum bilirubin concentration of as high as 150 µmol/L or as low as being
within the normal range. <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#90:1>
To render good-quality care and parental convenience , cases of
breast-milk jaundice should be managed by experienced primary care providers
who have access to laboratory investigations . </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#91:1>
Referrals from accident and emergency departments </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#92:1>
Suspected or confirmed cases of asthma formed a
disproportionately large proportion &obrack;  42.6&percent; &cbrack; of all cases referred
from accident and emergency departments , when compared with other services
that provide acute medical care such as private practitioners &obrack; 
17.2&percent; &cbrack; and general out-patient clinics &obrack;  12.3&percent; &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#93:1>
It is not surprising that asthma is a common reason for referral ,
because the prevalence of wheezing or asthma in children is approximately
10&percent;. <sp> 10,11 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#94:1>
Children who had attended an accident and emergency department for an
acute asthmatic attack were referred to the specialist clinic for follow-up .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#95:1>
If there were a well-established system of family physicians in Hong
Kong , uncomplicated cases should be managed by a family physician . </p> <h>
<it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#96:1>
Referrals from the Student Health Service </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#97:1>
The Student Health Service started to provide an annual physical
check-up for primary and secondary school students in 1995 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#98:1>
Students who are identified by the service as having medical and
psychological problems are referred to specialty clinics of regional
hospitals for further management .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#99:1>
Problems related to growth and puberty developments are , as expected
, common reasons for referral . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#100:1>
Obesity has become an important problem in Hong Kong children .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#101:1>
In a study performed in 1993 , 13.4&percent; of boys and
10.5&percent; of girls aged between 6 and 18 years were found to be obese.
<sp> 7 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#102:1>
The 38 &obrack;  14.8&percent; &cbrack; cases that were referred to the specialist
clinic in this study were probably only a fraction of all cases identified .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#103:1>
At the PYNEH , counseling on a group or individual basis is provided
by doctors , dietitians , and physiotherapists to such patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#104:1>
Parents and children should be educated in the community or at
school acquire a habit of regular exercise .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#105:1>
These measures would be more effective than seeing a doctor after
obesity has developed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#106:1>
Twenty-nine &obrack;  11.3&percent; &cbrack; of the 256 children were referred
for precocious puberty .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#107:1>
Genuine cases of central precocious puberty are quite rare .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#108:1>
Most of the referred cases probably represent the early end of the
age spectrum for normal sexual maturation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#109:1>
Recent studies performed in Hong Kong have shown that children now
have an earlier onset of pubertal development compared with children 20 to 30
years ago. <sp> 8,9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#110:1>
At least 10&percent; of Chinese girls had stage II breast
development &obrack;  ie onset of puberty &cbrack; before the age of 8 years &obrack;  the third and
tenth centiles were 7.10 and 7095 years , respectively). <sp> 8 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#111:1>
On the other hand , the third and tenth centiles for stage II of
testis development in Chinese boys were 8.4 and 9.3 years , respectively.
<sp> 9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#112:1>
The usual definition of precocious puberty for Caucasians &obrack;  ie onset
of puberty before 8 years for girls and 9 years for boys &cbrack; would result in
over investigation in approximately 7&percent; of cases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#113:1>
Doctors should therefore consider adopting the new reference
standards for local children <sp> 8,9 </sp> when considering cases of
precocious puberty for further investigation . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#114:1>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-023#115:1>
This study reflects the current referral patterns of carious
parties and quantities the major clinical problems encountered at an
put-patient paediatric clinic of a regional hospital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#116:1>
Training of physicians from referring parties as well as those in
the specialist clinic may be targeted to the common clinical problems
identified .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#117:1>
The training should include a thorough understanding of the clinical
problems , awareness of the normal variations , and knowledge of current
reference ranges .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#118:1>
Health administrators should focus on major problem areas such as
asthma and improve the coordination of the various care providers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-023#119:1>
Finally , the government and the concerned professional bodies
should be aware of their responsibility in promoting a healthy lifestyle to
the citizens of Hong Kong , starting from childhood . </p>
