<h> <bold> Keeping abreast of Hong Kong  ' s ever-changing moods and
opinions for the past three decades is the secret of the enduring soap opera
success that is 18/F Block C , writes <it> Vivienne Chow </it> </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#3:1>
<p> <bold> FOR 33 YEARS </bold> veteran broadcaster Chow Chiu-kit has played
the role of Boss Chow in Commercial Radio  ' s <it> 18/F Block C </it> , Hong
Kong  ' s longest-running drama series . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#4:1>
<p> Local radio soap operas typically consist of 30 or so episodes , run for
a month or two and are performed by actors or pop stars .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#5:1>
18/F Block C stands alone with its distinguished history and
long-serving cast of professional broadcasters . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#6:1>
<p>  ' I really have no idea why the show has lasted for so long, ' says Chow ,
better known as King Kong . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#7:1>
<p>  ' I think it  ' s because the programme is about current affairs , so there
are new issues to talk about every day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#8:1>
We can keep up with the city  ' s hectic pace. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#9:1>
<p> The show , which has applied for a place in the <it> Guinness Book Of
Records </it> as the longest-running radio drama , was created in memory of
Lam Bun , a Commercial Radio broadcaster who was burned to death by radical
leftists in the 1967 riots because of his opinions .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#10:1>
It initially went on air titled <it> Under Restraint </it> and later
as <it> An Objective Eye </it> before evolving into <it> 18/F Block C </it> ,
in honour of Lam  ' s address . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#11:1>
<p> His customers are from all walks of life - Madam Cheung &obrack;  Chu Shuit-mui &cbrack; , Moustachio &obrack;  Chan Sam &cbrack; , Landlord &obrack;  Yan Kam-wah &cbrack; , Aunt Toothless &obrack;  Chan Mo-yin &cbrack; , Uncle Tok &obrack;  Lee Kam &cbrack; and Uncle Junior &obrack;  Fung Chi-fung &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#12:1>
They gather at the shop to share their views on social issues and
government policy . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#13:1>
<p> When it was created in the 1960s , radio was still an important medium of
mass entertainment and radio dramas were mainstream programmes , a wide
variety of which were adapted from detective novels , fairy tales and ghost
stories .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#14:1>
At that time , Hong Kong  ' s people were struggling to improve their
lifestyles .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#15:1>
Listeners were typically factory workers or housewives .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#16:1>
'Landlord ' Yan recalls that living conditions were poor and the
average wage just &dollar;7 or &dollar;8 a day . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#17:1>
<p> As Hong Kong  ' s economy has grown , the locale has changed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#18:1>
Originally set in a Kwun Tong street stall , Boss Chow  ' expanded ' his
business and moved to the fictional shop premises on the island in 1975 .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#19:1>


<p> Since then , the coffee shop has become a voice of public opinion , which
helps explain why it is so popular .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#20:1>
It has always rated as one of the top three radio programmes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#21:1>
And while most of the cast is at least 50 years old , many young
listeners also tune in . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#22:1>
<p>  ' Though many housewives listen to our show , we know that university
students are among our regular audience too, ' says Chu , who plays Madam
Cheung . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#23:1>
<p> Students admit to listening to the programme for its informal and lively
summary of current events .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#24:1>
'I have been listening to <it> 18/F Block C </it> since I was a
child, ' says 20-year-old university student Yiu Kar-ming .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#25:1>
'It keeps me up to date with what is going on in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#26:1>
It never sounds tired to me .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#27:1>
The voices are so familiar . . . they  ' re like my next door
neighbours. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#28:1>
<p> The actors spend one hour a day , five days a week , recording episodes .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#29:1>
They have been doing it for so long that they no longer need to
rehearse their scripts . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#30:1>
<p> None of the cast remembers what the first show was like , but they recall
the hottest topics of the day. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#31:1>
<p>  ' Issues such as rises in water charges and bus fares were on the agenda,'
Chow says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#32:1>
'We have always tried to report the facts and bring different
perspectives forward in a tongue-in-cheek way , no matter what point of view
it is , be it the Government  ' s or the people's .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#33:1>
We aim to maintain a balance. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#34:1>
<p> Most of the cast has been with the show for 33 years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#35:1>
Their voices are so familiar to the public that their radio
characters have merged with their real-life identities .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#36:1>
Chow gives scriptwriter Tang Yeung-ko , who has been writing under
the pseudonym Tong Ling for more than 8,000 episodes , credit for this .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#37:1>
'He  ' s the one who gives the characters their unique personalities,'
Chow says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#38:1>
<p> While the show is always on the lookout for new blood , both writers and
actors , few suitable successors have been found to form the next generation .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#39:1>
<p>  ' We always encourage young people to participate in the show, ' Chow says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#40:1>
'But mostly they don't fit in .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#41:1>
It could be because the show is about current affairs , and one must
have accumulated enough social experience to express a good script .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#42:1>
Similarly , without voice acting experience , it  ' s hard to do a good
show. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#43:1>
<p> Yan suggests that young people are not hard working .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#44:1>
'Some of them have talents , but they are rather lazy, ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#45:1>
'They do not understand the job .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#46:1>
Take Boss Chow , for example .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#47:1>
He spends lots of time figuring out how to act well with his voice .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#48:1>
Youngsters are just not willing to spend the time. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#49:1>
<p> Five years is the minimum amount of time needed to reach the professional
standards set by the show , he says . </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#50:1>
<p> To mark the show  ' s 33rd birthday this month , rising stars Victor Chen
Sze-hon and girl pop duo Twins were featured . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#51:1>
<p>  ' Considering they have no experience in broadcasting , the anniversary
guests have done a great job, ' Chow says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#52:1>
<p>  ' Times have changed, ' Chu says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#53:1>
'Young people are a lot smarter than we were .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#54:1>
They know more about the world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#55:1>
We were very dumb. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#56:1>
<p> It is clear that the show is sustained by actors who love playing their
parts .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#57:1>
'If I didn't , I would not have been doing this for so long, ' says
Chow . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#58:1>
<p> He believes the characters ' enthusiasm for Hong Kong is genuine and that
having strong emotional ties to the city is important to their performances .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#59:1>
<p>  ' Basically it  ' s the scriptwriters ' job , but if we do care about our
society , it helps when it comes to playing the role, ' Chu says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#60:1>
<p> For Chu , working on <it> 18/F Block C </it> has changed her reading
habits .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#61:1>
While she seldom read newspapers before she joined the show , she now
says she can't start the day without them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#62:1>
'I turn to the local news section to get an idea about what is
happening in town , then I read through the international news, ' she says .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#63:1>
<p> Yan says this does more than just help them act better .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#64:1>
'Even though our scriptwriters have done enough research for each
episode , there can still be something wrong, ' he says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#65:1>
'We can catch mistakes if we know the facts beforehand. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#66:1>
<p> The cast hopes Hong Kong  ' s economy will prosper again as it did in the
1980s . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#67:1>
<p>  ' More jobs and more opportunities are the things we wish for the people
of Hong Kong, ' says Yan , who is looking forward to another 33 years in radio .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#71:2>
<h> In their heyday , they earned a small fortune and the adulation
of many fans .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#72:2>
These days , Hong Kong  ' s dwindling number of Cantonese opera singers
are forced to scrape a living in dingy clubs .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#73:2>
<bold> Sherry Lee </bold> reports </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#74:2>
<p   <bold> > IN THE 1980s </bold> , Cantonese opera singer Lam Fung
performed to rapturous fans in Yau Ma Tei  ' s Temple Street.

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#75:2>
Twenty years later , he struggles to make an impression .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#76:2>
On a recent evening at the Yuet Wan Singing Club , the 58-year-old
belts out a cover of a song of one of his idols , the late Cantonese opera
master Sun Ma Tsai .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#77:2>
But apart from a couple of die-hard fans , revellers continue
carousing , ignoring him even when he thanks them for their  ' big <it> <indig>
lai see </indig>  '  </it> : two &dollar;20 notes a couple of satisfied
customers have placed on a tray next to his microphone. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#78:2>
<p>  ' I feel very sad, ' he says , after his performance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#79:2>
'Now very few people admire the music. ' </p> <h> <bold> &ldquo; I
know noting else but singing . I  ' m too old to start from scratch &rdquo;
</bold> Cantonese opera singer &ldquo; Christina" </h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#80:2>
<p> Lam is part of a dying breed of Cantonese opera singers who perform at
places such as Yuet Wan , a <indig> yuet kuk gou tan </indig> , or Cantonese
opera club .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#81:2>
'The government has never promoted Cantonese opera and now people
prefer to listen to Canto-pop, ' Lam says , adding that a handful of clubs in
the area have closed in the past few years , leaving only six to continue the
tradition .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#82:2>
With few newcomers and existing performers in their twilight years ,
Lam fears the art form will disappear in the coming decade . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#83:2>
<p> It is not clear when singing clubs specialising in Cantonese opera first
appeared in Hong Kong , but , according to several performers , including
veteran Hon Wui-sing , they were a popular form of entertainment after World
War II in tea houses such as Koh Sing in Western district , which has since
closed , and Lin Heung in Central . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#84:2>
<p> In the 1960s , as television audiences swelled , some clubs closed ,
forcing performers to sing outdoors , for example , in front of the Tin Hau
Temple on Temple Street .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#85:2>
However , a government clampdown on noise control in the mid-1980s
forced many street performers indoors and prompted a renaissance in Cantonese
opera - albeit a short-lived one - as restaurants started featuring singers
in the hope of boosting business .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#86:2>
In 1987 , an opera-singing teacher apparently opened the first club
on Temple Street , giving refuge to those evicted from their outdoor spot and
providing a comfortable setting for fans of the music .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#87:2>
Soon , others followed suit . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#88:2>
<p> By charging an entrance fee of only &dollar;30 a head , the clubs provide
cheap entertainment to the poor and elderly - most regulars being in their
50s and 60s who visit for either of two sessions: between 3pm and 4pm , or
from 8pm to midnight .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#89:2>
But nowadays , many who frequent the clubs visit for the little
extras management provides , instead of for the music . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#90:2>
<p>  ' To attract men , some hire young local or mainland women with no singing
experience to perform Cantonese pop songs, ' says Lam .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#91:2>
'Others employ <foreign> katoeys </foreign> &obrack;  Thai transsexuals &cbrack; to
dance and a few have girls in bikinis singing; some even take off their tops .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#92:2>
We don't like this , but the owners have no choice. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#93:2>
<p> Yuet Wan itself has tried to fan business by employing  ' hostesses ' to
chat to customers , but still it often doesn't make enough to pay its singers
their basic salary of &dollar;150 a day .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#94:2>
To survive , the club has asked its performers to become  ' partners'
in the business , allowing them to buy  ' shares ' with the <it> <indig> lai see
</indig> </it> they receive from customers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#95:2>
Unable to survive on their meagre income , which is based on tips ,
many singers have quit to find jobs that pay better , or have found part-time
work to supplement what they make . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#96:2>
<p> Lam , who earned as much as &dollar;30,000 a month in the 1980s , then a
small fortune , now scrapes by on &dollar;4,000 to &dollar;5,000 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#97:2>
'Sometimes I make just &dollar;30 a day, ' he says , adding that he
now also sings at birthday parties or at other celebrations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#98:2>
'I  ' ve never thought of quitting , though .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#99:2>
I love singing , and if I can earn a living entertaining others , I  ' m
happy. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#100:2>
<p> Lam  ' s love of opera started while he was growing up in Guangzhou .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#101:2>
'I lived in a village and sometimes opera troupes visited to
perform, ' he remembers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#102:2>
'The first time I heard it I loved it. ' </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#103:2>
<p>  ' Christina ' , one of about 20 female professional Cantonese opera singers
remaining in Temple Street , says she continues what she does because she
can't find other employment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#104:2>
'I know nothing else but singing, ' the 40-something performer
explains , adding she earns about &dollar;3,000 a month .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#105:2>
'I  ' m too old to start from scratch.'

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#106:2>
Having to work around hostesses , however , embarrasses her so much
she declines to give her full name or be photographed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#107:2>
'I don't want people to think I have anything to do with these
women, ' she says .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#108:2>
Standing in the stairwell outside the singing club , she gazes at a
glass case holding pictures of her in her heyday . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#109:2>
<p> As part of the long-defunct Lai Yuen Women  ' s Opera Singing Troupe in Mei
Foo in the late 1970s , she remembers the beautiful gowns she used to wear on
stage . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#110:2>
<p>  ' I considered myself a singer and we only competed with our singing
skills , not with our youth or beauty, ' she says . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#111:2>
<p> With a cigarette clenched between his lips , the bespectacled Hon
Wui-sing drums out a beat with wooden sticks , his mind appearing to be
elsewhere .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#112:2>
Next to him , a female singer wearing a tight blue top serenades the
audience in unpolished tones . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#113:2>
<p> Things used to be different at opera clubs , he says after the
performance .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#114:2>
'When I was six , my father started taking me to tea houses to
listen to opera .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#115:2>
They were so good to listen to. ' Father and son made it a
thrice-weekly ritual , filling their bellies with barbecued pork buns for 30 cents a
plate and filling their ears with  ' refreshing music ' . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#116:2>
<p> In 1987 , aged 36 , Hon left his job as a taxi driver to pursue his
interest in opera singing , but after the economic downturn claimed the club
in which he performed , he returned to driving a cab and working part-time as
a drummer . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#117:2>
<p> Lam , however , can't think of doing anything else but singing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#118:2>
As soon as he hears his name announced , he breaks into a smile and
springs on to the stage .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#119:2>
But while the red wall behind him sparkles with lights , Lam  ' s
future is less than shiny .

<ICE-HK:W2B-004#120:2>
'Opera singing is a good art, ' he says ,  ' but no one admires it any
more. ' </p>
