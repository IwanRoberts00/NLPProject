<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-035#1:1:A>
First of all I I like to give you some uh <,> some idea of uhm
IT application in the clothing industry in the past uhm <,> maybe twenty
years uh in Hong Kong <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#2:1:A>
What I can say is that we can divide that into in four four stages
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#3:1:A>
I think uhm the first stage is uh what I call the the infant stage
and then uh that  ' s the stage that <,> people are still uh skeptical in uh
using uh computers or information technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#4:1:A>
And then the mid-eighties that uh is growing stage

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#5:1:A>
A lot of people are using uh computers

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#6:1:A>
And then later on in late in the late eighties there  ' s a lot of
people using uh information technology using CAD systems <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#7:1:A>
But coming to the nineties I think the <.> sof </.> software
industry or the <,> uh people using IT in the clothing industry should uh
should have uh some kind of breakthrough and uh I  ' d like to uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#8:1:A>
In the infant stage and uhm <,> it is because <,> computer  ' s very
expensive and uh usually uh it will cost you a million dollars in even in the
seventies

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#9:1:A>
During that time a million dollars is very expensive one

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#10:1:A>
And uh in ninety I think the first application uh in using computer
in the clothing industry was used by one of the leader

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#11:1:A>
That  ' s the Textile Alliance Limited

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#12:1:A>
And uh that  ' s uhm in nineteen seventy-four TAL installed I think
the should be <,> during that time one of the most advanced uh uh computer uh

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#13:1:A>
That  ' s the IBM System three

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#14:1:A>
To give you some idea of the System three <,> it had only sixteen K
memory and uh with uhm ten megabyte of disk storage

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#15:1:A>
And uh during that time ten megabyte of disk storage is a very
large uh disk storage

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#16:1:A>
And uh when I talking about sixteen K of uh memory and uh nobody
will consider it  ' s any any any number

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#17:1:A>
People are talking about sixteen megabyte right now

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#18:1:A>
And uhm and uh in nineteen eight uh seventy-eight I think TAL
install the one of the mainframe computer in uh in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#19:1:A>
That is the uh System three three seventy one one five

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#20:1:A>
Uhm although TAL is a such a large company then uh still consider
buying computer is very expensive <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#21:1:A>
That mainframe computer is uh in fact a secondhand computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#22:1:A>
So I can say that is an infant stage

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#23:1:A>
People are <,> not willing to invest a lot in computers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#24:1:A>
And uhm also there is an a need there  ' s <unc> 1-word
</unc> products

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#25:1:A>
They installed the first uh CAD systems and uh <,> in Hong Kong <,>
in nineteen seventy-eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#26:1:A>
And uh <,> by the by the end of the the uh seventies there are a
lot of computer applications and uh using mini-computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#27:1:A>
Uh the most uh uh <,> uh people use uh Rank computers NCR and uh
IBM systems <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#28:1:A>
In the mid-eighties and uh I <,> yes after the introduction of the
IBM PC there are a lot of more standalone applications say using uhm uh IBM
PC to do uh uh payroll and to do uh word processing and like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#29:1:A>
And there  ' re become more computer vendor participating in this uh
uh uh market and uh we have uh Hewlett Packard we have Unisys and also IBM
still is uh one of the uh uh uh leader and uh during that time a lot of
people buy system for the six and system for the eight

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#30:1:A>
And I mentioned earlier that in nineteen seventy-eight there  ' s
only only one vendor produce CAD systems but in the in the mid eighties there  ' re
a lot of uhm at least three more uhm computer <?> maker </?> making uh uh
software and uh computer systems uh available in Hong Kong so people <,>
began to have more choices <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#31:1:A>
In the late eighties then uh people are talking about integrated
software solutions

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#32:1:A>
They  ' re either manufacturing uh their own software by their own
in-house computer uhm department or they  ' re going to uh buy some uh standard
software packages and that  ' s also the PC networking is uh is become mature
and is also available

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#33:1:A>
And and then people are talking about uh they use the bundle
tickets in the past

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#34:1:A>
And the bundle ticket cost a a lot and uh it  ' s uh when they use it
to calculate the piecework payroll

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#35:1:A>
Sometimes uh it  ' s quite time-consuming so people are introducing a
data capturing device

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#36:1:A>
Direct capturing the data on the soft board so that they can uhm
have the payroll together with WRP more timely

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#37:1:A>
And uh also there  ' s more CAD system coming and uh PC-based uh CAD
system will is in fact available during that time

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#38:1:A>
And of course people are talking about some software just like the
uh uh using industrial engineering uh software just like the uh general
sewing data software that uh uh that being used in uh in <unc> 1-word
</unc> product in uh Textile Alliance <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#39:1:A>
Coming to nineties <,> I can see that a <,> lot more people use
data capturing device in the soft core because uhm uh using bundle tickets
still uh not the best way to uh to count or to do the the payroll and WIP

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#40:1:A>
Yes also there  ' s a time delay in using the bundle tickets

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#41:1:A>
If people are very concerned on balancing their line this kind of
uhm data capturing device will be very useful

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#42:1:A>
And <,> if you you consider the data capturing device uhm uh in the
past probably it cost you a lot of money but right now for a maybe a three or
four thousand dollar you can get one terminal <,> to put in your uh sewing
uhm uh operator  ' s uh machine and uh input all the data

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#43:1:A>
And people are <,> moving to the open system uh develop more uhm
UNIX-based software

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#44:1:A>
If uh you are not uh familiar with the computer industry UNIX is uh
<,> uh right now a quite popular uh operating system

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#45:1:A>
Uh it  ' s a mainly a mini-base uh uhm standard operating system

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#46:1:A>
Just like the if you you have the experience with the IBM PC the
IBM PC MS-DOS is from the PC you can call the UNIX system a mini-computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#47:1:A>
People are <,> uh porting the the software into UNIX base

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#48:1:A>
And also people are you uhm developing some colour communication
systems

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#49:1:A>
Uhm <,> before that if you have to communicate with your uh dyeing
house uh on one particular colour probably you have to send a sample and uh
so that they can make sure that the the right colour

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#50:1:A>
But right now in uh in America people are developing uh some kind
of colour communication system using the high definition television set so
that the colour can reproduce the uh exact tone everything  ' s uhm uh instead
of uh using uh some kind of courier service to send the samples around

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#51:1:A>
And also there if you have the chance to go to our exhibition in
Hong Kong side you can see some uh some fashion design system

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#52:1:A>
And uhm the final one is the some kind of a multi-media application

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#53:1:A>
And uh in the past all the computer applications are mainly on text
basis on uh data forcing application but right now the software technology
can allow you to do some kind of imaging <,> and uh so that you can send
pictures and graphics together with the the data

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#54:1:A>
That is something that uh uh the clothing industry uh should look
at because <,> you can produce all the orders uh customer the confirmation in
the computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#55:1:A>
But if there  ' s a sketch then you have to really make the the
photocopy and then attach it

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#56:1:A>
That will cost you a lot of money

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#57:1:A>
And sometimes if uh in uh designer you would like to refer a
particular order in the past <,> they cannot just go into the computer system
and say that  ' s the number say one two three four and understand what is in
inside

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#58:1:A>
He have to go over the original uh file they have and get the
picture out and say that is the one two three four

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#59:1:A>
But if the multi-media application probably you can even store all
the image pictures in the computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#60:1:A>
When you key in one two three four it will choose the the garment
picture directly

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#61:1:A>
So you you it can speed up all the all the all the uh data
processing uh function because in uh this field you cannot just talking about
numbers

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#62:1:A>
You have to talk about colours talk about uh images <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#63:1:A>
Uhm so much for the for the histories and uh actually I start
working in uhm uh TAL when uhm they installed the uh IBM System three

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#64:1:A>
And uhm during the past uhm I can see sixty seven years I involve
uh heavily in uh computer applications in the clothing industry <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#65:1:A>
My <,> my experience with all the implementation is that you can
really separate into two uh uh major part

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#66:1:A>
Actually the first one is uhm <,> if you cannot implement the the
the any computer application there may be management problem there may be
technical problem <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#67:1:A>
In the management problem side <,> I think the major changes are
now under management style

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#68:1:A>
A lot of the factories uhm in the past are really uhm home-run or
home-room business

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#69:1:A>
The boss knew everyone in the in the factory uh from from workers
to to supervisors and because they  ' re small they maintain a family-like uh
business

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#70:1:A>
But gradually then kind of uhm old generation fades out and the
second generation take take charge

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#71:1:A>
Most of them have been uh uh educated uh quite well in the in the
in in in overseas or in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#72:1:A>
They introduce some new mention uh concept into the factories

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#73:1:A>
They expand the factory

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#74:1:A>
So there is a some kind of <,> change in the management style <,>
from a family business to a <,> uh you can say a multi-national company

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#75:1:A>
Some of the factories in uh in Hong Kong has grown to be really
multi-national companies

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#76:1:A>
Another thing is that people has some kind of tendency not to
change anything

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#77:1:A>
If they use the same systems uh for thirty years they prefer to use
it <,> and still use it

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#78:1:A>
They don't want to use the computer

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#79:1:A>
They don't want to use the keyboards

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#80:1:A>
They use pens <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#81:1:A>
The third thing is the <?> lack </?> of the management commitment

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#82:1:A>
<?> Now </?> sometimes <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#83:1:A>
I can give you a <.> some </.> a graph like that <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#84:1:A>
Usually when when some computer system was introduced or IT
application was introduced in the in the in the factory the senior management  ' s
commitment will be really on the initial stages <,> because uh it  ' s the uh
stage for negotiating the the the price of the the the hardware and the
software

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#85:1:A>
And gradually after the installation of the of the computer they
said okay that is uh something that should be carried out by by the by the
uhm lower management

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#86:1:A>
In that case <,> difficult really to motivate people to use a
computer because the the senior management is is not really interested in the
final result of the the the computers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#87:1:A>
Of course the final thing is the <,> in the past people are talking
much too much on cost control

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#88:1:A>
When they introduce the the payroll system they  ' ll consider how
many payroll card I can save and uh I can fire so that uh that is the the
saving

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#89:1:A>
But right now if you consider using IT here  ' s something that you
should uh consider is to improve the efficiency really to compete with uh
your competitors <,> not really just to to consider the cost <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#90:1:A>
Talking about the technical problems the first one is that uhm
actually the the quality of the software is usually not that good because uh
computer <.> peo </.> people didn't really want to work in the the clothing
industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#91:1:A>
They prefer to work in the banks

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#92:1:A>
They prefer to work with the the airlines so only seldom <,> you
can find good people working in the industry to develop software for the
industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#93:1:A>
So in general I think in the past the quality of the software is
not that good

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#94:1:A>
Another another point is that it <.> i </.> is really related to
first part <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#95:1:A>
Some software house may consider to start with the the the the
garment industry but later on they consider that there  ' re a lot of business
opportunity in the in the banking sector in the video sector

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#96:1:A>
They switch the the business strategy to the to the to that sector

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#97:1:A>
And so sometimes you can see the the support service is not not
that good

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#98:1:A>
The third part is that usually those people are not really uh
working in the garment industry or the clothing industry

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#99:1:A>
They cannot really <.> commun </.> communicate uh the requirement
with the uh with the end user so I can see that is the <?> quite </?> few
technical problems <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#100:1:A>
But in fact that is uh all the problems and uh then how how can we
really uh uhm know whether we should uh uh uh buy this system or not

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#101:1:A>
<unc> 1-word </unc> I  ' d like to take an uhm some kind of
uh suggestion by a an Harvard professor and uh he consider that the
implementation risk should consist of three factors

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#102:1:A>
The first factor is the how well define the project  ' s output <,>
whether you know the exact uh objective of using that kind of technology
using that kind of uh system

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#103:1:A>
I can put it as uh some kind of project definition

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#104:1:A>
Another thing is that how much of the technology is really new to
the companies

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#105:1:A>
Some companies say uh in America are saying that EDI is not new

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#106:1:A>
Uh we can use CDI

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#107:1:A>
That  ' s very simple but if you some technology is really new then
the implementation risk will be higher

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#108:1:A>
If you  ' re using a a manual system using a PC this is switching
from a a a a manual system to a something that using computers that is uh the
change of technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#109:1:A>
The third dimension is of course the project size <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#110:1:A>
The larger project size the higher risk <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#111:1:A>
<.> Basi </.> basically you can you can uh <,> have this uh risk
matrix

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#112:1:A>
Actually if you  ' re using some kind of low technology uh product
then the project is always at low risk but of course low risk will imply very
low return on your investment

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#113:1:A>
So it  ' s a you have to be very careful <,> whether you you should
take some kind of high risk <,> job or just like to take some kind of low
risk low risk and uh low technology uh uh task

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#114:1:A>
Say for example the project definition on a on the colour
communication

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#115:1:A>
Iit  ' s <.> al </.> also always not very clear and it involves some
kind of high <.> tech </.> technology

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#116:1:A>
And you need some to do some kind of uh basic uh research

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#117:1:A>
So that kind of uhm project is a high risk project <,> but if you
can really implement them then the return will be <.> ver </.> very very high

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#118:1:A>
So it really depends on uh how you you treat a project how you
measure a particular project

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#119:1:A>
One project may appear to be a low risk project <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#120:1:A>
Applying to another company may be a very high risk project so
probably you have to <,,> get a very basic understanding of your company and
uhm to see whether you are your company is a <.> reas </.> really a risk
taker

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#121:1:A>
You  ' re expecting to to have a a high return

<ICE-HK:S2A-035#122:1:A>
In that case you can take uh some uh some high risk project </I>
