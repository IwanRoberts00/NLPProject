<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#3:1>
PROMINENT Hongkong businessmen are expected to dominate the second
batch of the Beijing-appointed Hongkong Affairs Advisers , with at least four
members of the Governor  ' s own Business Council being included in the new
line-up . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#4:1>
Leading academics , including the vice-chancellors of the
territory  ' s three universities , as well as prominent professionals are also
on the list expected to be unveiled by Monday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#5:1>
The group is expected to leave for Beijing on April 1 , and be
inducted at a ceremony the following day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#6:1>
The members of the Governor  ' s top business advisory body invited

&semi; Mr Peter Woo Kwong-ching , chairman of Wharf Holdings &semi; Mr

Mr Walter Kwok Ping-sheung , chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#7:1>
Their addition to the panel , which will be expanded from the
original 43 to almost 100 , means that six out of Mr Patten  ' s 18 business
advisers will also be giving their opinions to China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#8:1>
Mr Vincent Lo Hong-sui , chairman of Shui On group , and Mr Gordon
Wu Ying-sheung , managing director of Hopewell Holdings , were in China  ' s
original panel and on the Business Council introduced by Mr Patten in his
policy address last October . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#9:1>
Mr Cheng , who is chairman of the Hongkong General Chamber of
Commerce and works for British interests likely to come under attack in the
recent political row , is believed to have maintained a good relationship
with officials in Beijing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#10:1>
He is a member of the Business and Professionals Federation
&obrack; BPF &cbrack; which is openly against Mr Patten  ' s proposals , and is
planning a trip to Beijing next month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#11:1>
Other prominent businessmen include : Mr Robert Kuok Hock-nien ,
a Malaysian tycoon whose interests include the Shangri-La hotels group and
property &semi; Mr Cheng Yu-tung , chairman of New World Development , Mr Lee
Shau-kee , chairman of Henderson Land Development , and Mr Lim Por-yen ,
chairman of the Lai Sun Group . </p>

<p>

The vice-chancellors from the three local universities &dash;
Professor Charles Kao from Chinese University of Hongkong &obrack; CUHK
&cbrack; , Professor Woo Chia-wei from the Hongkong University of Science and
Technology , and Professor Wang Gungwu from Hongkong University , are also
invited to join the second batch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#13:1>
However , it is understood that Professor Wang , formerly an
Executive Councillor who stepped down in October when Mr Patten revamped his
inner cabinet , has yet to indicate his acceptance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#14:1>
Mr Lee Ming-kwan and Mr Thomas Chan Man-hung from Hongkong
Polytechnic , Mr Wang Liang-huew from the Hongkong University , Mr Lau
Siu-kai of the CUHK are also to be named . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#15:1>
Another dominant group would be professionals from different
sectors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#16:1>
Among them are Mr Lau Shiu-kwan , a surveyor &semi; Mr Hon
Bing-wah , a designer &semi; Mr Raymond Ho Chung-tai , a civil engineer and a
BPF member &semi; and , Mr Carson Wen , a solicitor and a China-appointed

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#17:1>
Mr Van Lau , a prominent sculptor and one of the local judges
which decided the Hongkong Special Administrative Region  ' s flag and emblem
in 1989 , is also expected to be appointed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#18:1>
Mr Jose Yu Sun-say , a newly-appointed deputy to the Chinese
People  ' s Political Consultative Conference , is also on the list . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#19:1>
Ms Elsie Leung of Hongkong Democratic Alliance for the Betterment
of Hongkong &obrack; DAB &cbrack; , and Mr Chan Wing-kee of BPF ,
newly-appointed deputies to the National People  ' s Congress , are also
expected to be appointed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#20:1>
Apart from Sir David Akers-Jones , former Secretary for Works Mr
Nicky Chan Nai-keong is also likely to join incumbent adviser Mr Donald Liao
Poon-huai to share their valuable experience of working in the Government
with China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#21:1>
Media representatives include Mr Ma Lik from <it> Hongkong
Commercial Daily </it> and Mr Louis Cha from Ming Pao . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#22:1>
More pro-China politicians are to be appointed by China . The One
Country , Two Systems Economic Research Institute  ' s Executive Director Mr
Shiu Sin-por will join the centre  ' s seven executive committee members to
become Hongkong affairs advisers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#23:1>
With two more members from the New Hongkong Alliance &dash;
chairman Mr Wai Kee-shun and member Mr Philip Yuen Pak-yiu , a solicitor
&dash; to be appointed as advisers , the alliance , led by Mr Lo Tak-shing ,
will have seven members directly advising China on Hongkong affairs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#24:1>
The second largest group of politicians would come from DAB
&semi;

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#25:1>
Ms Leung aside , Mr Tsang Yok-sing , Mr Tam Yiu-chung and Ms Chan
Yuen-han are also joining the second batch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#26:1>
The Co-operative Resources Centre also fared well with Mr Allen
Lee Peng-fei , Mr Steven Poon Kwok-lim , Mr Stephen Cheong Kam-chuen and Mr
Ngai Shiu-kit joining the incumbent adviser Mr Lau Wong-fat . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#27:1>

TALKS between Britain and China on the airport financing package
resumed yesterday after a seven-month suspension . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#32:2>
Speaking after yesterday  ' s Joint Liaison Group &obrack; JLG
&cbrack; Airport Committee meeting , British team leader Tony Galsworthy said
the atmosphere of the meeting was good and he hoped they would be able to
have a resolution soon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#33:2>
&ldquo; We had a lengthy discussion this morning , following the
Memorandum .

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#34:2>
And we will need to have further meetings , which I hope will take
place before very long in order to take the matter further , &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#35:2>
In Tokyo , Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod welcomed the
resumption of talks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#36:2>
&ldquo; At the moment it looks as if economics and politics are
being treated separately .

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#37:2>
I hope we can keep the two separate , &rdquo; he said , although he
cautioned against expecting any immediate agreement on financing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#38:2>
Mr Galsworthy said the Western Harbour Tunnel project was
discussed and said he hoped the tunnel franchise could be resolved in the
next few meetings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#39:2>
He also said the British side had told their Chinese counterparts
that the Central and Wan Chai reclamation project needed to be set in motion
very soon and various proposals had been put forward . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#40:2>
&ldquo; It is misleading to talk of a first , second or a third
proposal ... there is an infinite spectrum of possibilities , &rdquo; he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#41:2>
He said it was impossible to talk about any one deadline for
agreement as the airport projects involved a large number of different
contracts and time scales . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#42:2>
The British side was waiting for the Chinese side to respond in
detail to various suggestions they had made . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#43:2>
&ldquo; The ball is rather in their court at the moment , &rdquo;
he said . </p> </I>

<bold> Beijing accepts further funding for airport body </bold> </h>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#45:3>
<bold> By DOREEN CHEUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#46:3>
CHINA yesterday raised no objection to further funding for the
Provisional Airport Authority &obrack; PAA &cbrack; , although there is still
no agreement with Britain on the financial package for the Chek Lap Kok
airport and rail link . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#47:3>
Speaking after a three-hour meeting of the Joint Liaison Group  ' s
Airport Committee , British team leader Tony Galsworthy said no objection was
raised to more funds being channelled to the PAA . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#48:3>
Shortly after the meeting , the Government informed Legislative
Councillors that it would be seeking approval for another &dollar;564 million .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#49:3>
It is understood that the Government slashed the request from
&dollar;1 billion because of likely opposition from legislators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#50:3>
The final figure &dash; in the region that legislators had
indicated was acceptable &dash; provides &dollar;374 million for short-term
head office expenses and &dollar;190 million for eight critical airport
design packages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#51:3>
The request will go to the Legislative Council  ' s committee on
airport finance and the Airport Consultative Committee by next Thursday .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#52:3>
In justifying the head office cost up to next March , the draft
paper said any funding for a lesser period would fail to sustain staff morale
, weaken the authority  ' s commercial position , and have auditors qualify its
accounts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#53:3>
Funding for the eight design contracts has become critical to
maintain momentum and provide vital input for site preparation work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#54:3>
These design packages will need to be started before July . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#55:3>
Any delay in funding for the head office and the design contracts
could result in serious delays in the completion of the airport platform and
claims from the site preparation contractors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#56:3>
In detailing the expenditure of the PAA , the paper noted that a
saving of &dollar;151 million had been achieved in the award of five design
packages &dash; temporary utilities , permanent utilities , waste water and
storm water drains and sewerage , airfield tunnels , and irrigation systems
&dash; which were awarded last May . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#57:3>
Out of the original &dollar;236 million approved , only
&dollar;85 million was required . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#58:3>
The &dollar;151 million saving on the packages was still
available to meet the authority  ' s requirements for other critical design
work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#59:3>
Of the total commitment of &dollar;743 million approved to meet
the authority  ' s head office expenses up to June , &dollar;125 million could
be saved mainly by the reduced expenditure on staff recruitment and the
employment of consultancies on the PAA  ' s longer term strategic and planning
issues . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#60:3>
This saving could be applied to head office expenses after June .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#61:3>
The PAA required a total of &dollar;840 million the paper said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#62:3>
It revealed that the Government hoped that Britain and China
would reach an agreement on the financing of the new airport by June 30 .

LEGISLATOR Samuel Wong Ping-wai is to pressure the Provisional
Airport Authority &obrack; PAA &cbrack; to become more open about its affairs
following concern over mismanagement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#66:4>
Instead of a fully-appointed board of directors for the future
Airport Authority , Mr Wong suggested some seats should be designated to
legislators and municipal councillors to enhance the authority  ' s
accountability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#67:4>
He also raised the concern that the senior posts in the PAA were
held mainly by expatriates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#68:4>
Mr Wong , the late Stephen Cheong Kam-chuen  ' s replacement in the
Legislative Council  ' s <it> ad hoc </it> group on airport finance , said he
would pressure the PAA to reveal more on its internal management . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#69:4>
Noting that many questions directed to the PAA had been left
unanswered , Mr Wong said legislators would draft and file a list of
questions to the PAA . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#70:4>
&ldquo; I would force the PAA officials to seriously respond to
our inquiries by holding regular meetings .

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#71:4>
We can't drill them only when they seek money from the Legislative
Council , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#72:4>
Mr Wong said he would like to know whether the PAA had pledged to
cultivate local people to take up senior positions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#73:4>
Meanwhile , Chinese authorities have urged the Hongkong
Government to send a copy of the upcoming Airport Authority Bill as soon as
possible , according to Mr Hung Wing-tat of the Conservation Association .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#74:4>
A government source said the draft bill should be ready by early
next month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#75:4>
The draft bill would go to the Executive Council for endorsement
and then to the Chinese side for consultation , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#76:4>
He attributed the slow progress to technical reasons rather than
the Sino-British row over the airport issue . </p> </I>

<bold> Electoral bill talks defended at forum </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> By DOREEN CHEUNG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#79:5>
LEGISLATORS yesterday justified their move to discuss the
electoral bill before China and Britain had reached agreement by saying it
would guarantee the bill  ' s smooth passage in the legislature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#80:5>
Speaking at a City Forum , Andrew Wong Wang-fat said discussing
the bill in the Legislative Council  ' s constitutional development panel would
avoid a repeat of the Court of Final Appeal incident . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#81:5>
There would be a big storm if the legislature decided to reject
the Sino-British agreement on the electoral arrangements , he said . &ldquo;
Why don't we discuss the bill now ? &rdquo; he asked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#82:5>
The introduction of the Court of Final Appeal has been brought to
a halt after legislators refused to accept an agreement on the court  ' s
composition reached by China and Britain . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#83:5>
Legislator Frederick Fung Kin-kee said it was better to air their
views before an agreement had been reached . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#84:5>
Legislator Henry Tang Ying-yen from the Liberal Party said
Hongkong people had been kept in the dark over the past four rounds of
Sino-British talks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#85:5>
He said people should express their views through whatever means
possible . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#86:5>
But Dr Lo Chi-keung from the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hongkong insisted it was not the right time to discuss the bill .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#87:5>
Meanwhile , a signed commentary from the Hongkong China News
Agency warned that some legislators , with the support of the Hongkong
Government , might be trying to table the electoral bill in Legco through a
piece-meal approach . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#88:5>
This had been reflected by the passage of the boundary and
election commission bill and the constitutional development panel  ' s decision
to discuss the electoral bill , it said . </p> </I>

THE University and Polytechnic Grants Committee &obrack; UPGC
&cbrack; plans to triple the number of postgraduates in local institutions by
1994 , according to the committee  ' s yet to be released report for the
1988-91 triennium . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#92:6>
However , the head of one university has expressed doubts about
whether the amount of research funding will be sufficient to attract high
caliber staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#93:6>
The UPG plans to increase the number of postgraduate research
students in the territory  ' s seven tertiary institutions from the existing
860 to 2218 in 1993-94 , according to the report . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#94:6>
This figure is equivalent to 41/2 per cent of the total
population of 48,800 in the six tertiary education institutions , apart from
Lingnan College , funded by the UPGC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#95:6>
The proportion of postgraduate students has been increasing since
1988-89 from 1.8 per cent to 2.1 per cent in 1990-91 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#96:6>
After consultation with the six tertiary education institutions ,
the UPGC projected that the number of postgraduate students would top 1,285
in 1991-92 , 1,713 in 1992-93 and 2,218 in 1993-94 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#97:6>
Compared with the total number of students , the percentage of
postgraduate students will be increased gradually from three per cent in
1991-92 , to 3.8 per cent in 1992-93 and 41/2 per cent in 1993-94 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#98:6>
However , the vice-chancellor of Hongkong University , Professor
Wang Gungwu , has said insufficient research funds might have an adverse
effect in retraining high calibre staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#99:6>
This is despite the fact that the Legislative Council has
approved &dollar;510 million for research projects up to 1995 , including a
doubling of the fund to &dollar;100 million for the 1991-92 academic year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#100:6>
While &dollar;122 million has been allocated for 1992-93 ,
&dollar;144 million has been ear-marked for both 1993-94 and 1994-95 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#101:6>
But the institutions ha e been urged to spend about two per cent
of their recurrent lump sum grants to provide the necessary research
infrastructure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#102:6>
The UPGC has said the increase reflected the Government  ' s
acceptance of the need in this area as a means of attracting and retraining
high calibre staff . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#103:6>
Dr Wang , however , said the funds fell short of demand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#104:6>
&ldquo; My colleagues are full of initiatives to do research .

<ICE-HK:W2C-001#105:6>
But they are often stopped from carrying it out because of money
shortages , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#106:6>
The worst-hit research areas had been those in the scientific
field , which required a lot of financial support , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#107:6>
Aware of the small research funding allocation , the Government
has encouraged the institutions to seek private funding for research from the
Croucher Foundation and the Royal Hongkong Jockey Club . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#108:6>
But Dr Wang said little money had been granted by the two
organisations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#109:6>
The university would try to seek funding on its own to finance
research projects as well as to keep its academic staff , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#110:6>
However , the university and the Chinese University will be
training a lesser share of postgraduate research student population as the
numbers increase . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-001#111:6>
The Hongkong University of Science and Technology will take an
increasingly important role in the area by expanding its number of
postgraduate students from 74 in 1991-92 to 276 in 1993-94 . </p> </I>
