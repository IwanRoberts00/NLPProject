<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#3:1>
&ldquo; Good news !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#4:1>
Wei has got the one-way permit to come next month , at last ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#5:1>
My son ran into the kitchen , set aside the wok I was washing and put
the letter into my hand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#6:1>
&ldquo; Well , very well .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#7:1>
My grandchildren can have their mother look after them . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#8:1>
I summoned a smile to my face .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#9:1>
&ldquo; Hurrah ! &rdquo; the four kids shouted , jumping from one
mattress to another and squeezing their little bodies along the corridor
between the large bags of clothing and utensils . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#10:1>
The door opened and a body filled the door frame .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#11:1>
The children rushed towards their mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#12:1>
She kneeled down to embrace them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#13:1>
They clung to their mother like bees around the nectar of a sweeter
flower within the pot .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#14:1>
&ldquo; Wei , come to the altar !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#15:1>
Kneel down here and thank our ancestors for bringing you to Hong Kong .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#16:1>
&ldquo; Yes, <indig> <it> nai nai </it> </indig> . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#17:1>
Wei let go of her children immediately and knelt towards the altar
beside the door .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#18:1>
She held three incense sticks before her breast and bowed three times .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#19:1>
She bowed so low that she nearly burnt her forehead with the incense
sticks .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#20:1>
&ldquo; Having waited for eight years , I can finally live here ,
together with my children .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#21:1>
What more can I wish ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#22:1>
I  ' m so thankful . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#23:1>
Tears broke through the gates of her eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#24:1>
I almost cried with her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#25:1>
The smoke of the incense sticks was very strong .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#26:1>
After that day , I parted with my life-long companion , housework .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#27:1>
&ldquo; I have a lot of leisure time now , almost too much , &rdquo;
I told Chung .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#28:1>
I only confided in my grandson .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#29:1>
I had tried to sweep the floor once , but I was caught by Wei and my
broom was confiscated .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#30:1>
Whenever I tried to wash the dishes , I was expelled from the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#31:1>
Sometimes I woke up earlier than everyone so as to wipe the table and
then went back to my bed to pretend that I was sleeping .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#32:1>
Wei did all the housework and she did it efficiently .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#33:1>
Still , I found dust under the television set and in the crevice
between the bags of clothes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#34:1>
Wei got up early every day , earlier than everyone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#35:1>
When we woke up , the breakfast was ready .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#36:1>
But what she prepared was merely cornflakes , which could be ready in
a minute .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#37:1>
&ldquo; Grandma , I love the porridge and the deep-fried flour you
make , &rdquo; Chung used to say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#38:1>
Of course , it needed at least an hour to prepare the porridge , and
the amount of water added should be exact , otherwise , it would either be
too concentrated or too diluted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#39:1>
On the day before my grandson  ' s birthday , I decided to claim
the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#40:1>
I went to the market and bought chicken legs , salted fish , lean
pork and white gourd , all of which were my grandson  ' s favourites .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#41:1>
I went home , ready to delight Chung with all his favourite food .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#42:1>
When I arrived home , Chung waved his little arms and hopped towards
me laughingly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#43:1>
&ldquo; Grandma , Mommy is going to prepare a great meal for us today .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#44:1>
&ldquo; Really ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#45:1>
Grandma will give you an even greater meal . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#46:1>
I hurried to the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#47:1>
&ldquo; <indig> <it> Nai nai </it> </indig> , why do you go to the
market ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#48:1>
I  ' ve already bought the food . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#49:1>
Wei blocked my entrance into the kitchen with her body .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#50:1>
&ldquo; I  ' ll cook today !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#51:1>
Chung likes to eat what I cook . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#52:1>
&ldquo; No , I can't let you tire yourself with housework .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#53:1>
Go and take a rest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#54:1>
Watch the television or simply have a nap . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#55:1>
I could listen to her no more .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#56:1>
I pushed her aside , went into the kitchen and put all my food into
the zinc basin and began to wash it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#57:1>
Wei remained in the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#58:1>
She stirred the soy bean , flour and sugar to make her sauce .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#59:1>
I took out a tureen , filled it with water and put it on the kerosene
stove to prepare the soup .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#60:1>
She began to cut her carrots and beef

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#61:1>
Her shoulder rubbed against mine and I felt her right hand moving
faster and faster .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#62:1>
I got angry with my own hands .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#63:1>
Why were they so sluggish ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#64:1>
I wanted to cut the white gourd first .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#65:1>
But how about the pork ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#66:1>
Should I make the sauce first ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#67:1>
I haven't defrosted the chicken legs !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#68:1>
Where is the salt ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#69:1>
Suddenly , I felt dizzy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#70:1>
My legs staggered .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#71:1>
My body fell towards Wei  ' s right arm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#72:1>
&ldquo; Ahhhhhhhh ... &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#73:1>
Blood filled my forehead .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#74:1>
It dropped onto my face like a shower .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#75:1>
&ldquo; Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh .... &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#76:1>
Her cry pierced into my ear .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#77:1>
Blood soaked both of her hands .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#78:1>
&ldquo; Call 999 ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#79:1>
She shouted at the children and ran out of the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#80:1>
At last , I was the only one left in the kitchen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#81:1>
Beside my bed , Chung was crying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#82:1>
&ldquo; Chung , don't be afraid .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#83:1>
How  ' s your mother ? &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#84:1>
&ldquo; I don't know , the police took her away . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#85:1>
His face was grimy with tears and his voice was trembling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#86:1>
&ldquo; Child , you can't stay in the ward .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#87:1>
Wait outside . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#88:1>
The nurse got hold of his struggling hands and took him out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#89:1>
&ldquo; Grandma !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#90:1>
I want grandma !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#91:1>
I want Mommy ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#92:1>
He looked back at me with watery eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#93:1>
Tears thrust opened my eyes as though they were bleeding . </p> </I>

<I> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#94:2>
<bold> Free as a Bird , Free as a Kite </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#95:2>
There was once a bird called Birdie .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#96:2>
Everyday , she sat in her nest .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#97:2>
Everyday , her head drooped .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#98:2>
And everyday in the morning , we could hear this conversation in
Birdie  ' s nest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#99:2>
&ldquo; Mom , can I go out and play ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#100:2>
&ldquo; No , you can't , games are stupid . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#101:2>
&ldquo; But ... &ldquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#102:2>
&ldquo; No buts , &rdquo; Mama bird roared .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#103:2>
&ldquo; My words are commands ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#104:2>
With a frown , Birdie sat down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#105:2>
Birdie was already two years old and was old enough to go out to
play .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#106:2>
She was even old enough to have a family of her own .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#107:2>
&ldquo; Why can't I go out to play ? &rdquo; she murmured . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#108:2>
&ldquo; Because you are too old for silly birdie games ! &ldquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#109:2>
Mama bird replied coldly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#110:2>
&ldquo; But you never let me out to play , even when I was young !
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#111:2>
&ldquo; There are kids who will throw stones at you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#112:2>
There are eagles who will eat you . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#113:2>
&lsquo; Same old words ... , &rsquo; thought Birdie . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#114:2>
Mama bird , with only one child then , was soon going to have
two .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#115:2>
She had laid an enormous egg .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#116:2>
She could not leave it alone for a minute , so Birdie had to find
many worms and bugs for her mom and herself . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#117:2>
&ldquo; Birdie , go out and fetch me some caterpillars , &rdquo;
said Mama bird . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#118:2>
&ldquo; Ow , not caterpillars again , they are sticky .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#119:2>
I would rather have some beetles , they  ' re ... &rdquo; Birdie
moaned . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#120:2>
&ldquo; GO , QUICK and SHUT UP ! &rdquo; after some yelling and
shouting , Mama bird went back to her egg business . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#121:2>
Birdie stood up , combed her feathers and hopped out of the nest .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#122:2>
&ldquo; Don't go too far , and better get some juicy ones ,
&rdquo; Mama bird said .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#123:2>
&ldquo; Last time you picked dead ones .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#124:2>
They tasted terrible . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#125:2>
&lsquo; Dead ones aren't sticky , &rsquo; thought Birdie . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#126:2>
&ldquo; Also , don't try to fly , you are too young to do so .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#127:2>
If you fly , the eagles will find you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#128:2>
Just hop .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#129:2>
And come back soon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#130:2>
I feel a thunderstorm coming . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#131:2>
&ldquo; Simply endless , &rdquo; Birdie murmured .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#132:2>
She then stomped her feet and hopped away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#133:2>
The Autumn breeze was cool and strong , and Birdie sang a song
as she hopped onto the branch of an oak tree that was facing the grassland .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#134:2>
Autumn , is a good time for kite flying , so there were many little
kids in the field flying kites . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#135:2>
&ldquo; Wow ! how beautiful these kites are ! &rdquo; Birdie
thought as she perched on the branch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#136:2>
That was the first time she had seen kites . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#137:2>
&ldquo; Hi , &rdquo; she said to a kite , but she stopped
immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#138:2>
&ldquo; How stupid I am ! &ldquo; and she looked around to make sure
there were no other birds around .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#139:2>
She looked at the kites again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#140:2>
In the sky , there were many different kinds of kites flying around
, some were red and some were white &semi; some are were shaped like
butterflies and some looked like eagles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#141:2>
&ldquo; OH NO !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#142:2>
There  ' s an eagle over there , I hope he didn't see me . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#143:2>
Birdie started to hop away . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#144:2>
&ldquo; Did you say hi to me ? &rdquo; a warm voice came into
Birdie  ' s ears . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#145:2>
&ldquo; Uh ... hello , &ldquo; Birdie stopped and answered .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#146:2>
&ldquo; Hi ! I  ' m over here , the kite you are looking at !
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#147:2>
&ldquo; But I am looking at dozens of kites ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#148:2>
&ldquo; I  ' m the one like a eagle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#149:2>
I  ' m flying near you now . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#150:2>
&ldquo; No , NO ! Don't fly near me , have mercy , don't eat me
up ! &rdquo; cried Birdie , already shivering with fear . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#151:2>
The kite burst out laughing , &ldquo; Eat you !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#152:2>
Crack !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#153:2>
Crack !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#154:2>
Have you ever ever heard of a kite eating a bird ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#155:2>
I can't even open my beak ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#156:2>
As the kite flew near Birdie , she found that he really was a
kite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#157:2>
&ldquo; I am so sorry , I shouldn't have yelled at you , &rdquo;
Birdie said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#158:2>
&ldquo; Never mind , you are sort of ... cute .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#159:2>
What  ' s your name ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#160:2>
&ldquo; I am Birdie . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#161:2>
&ldquo; Good name , and how are you today ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#162:2>
&ldquo; I  ' m fine ... nah , I am not . &ldquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#163:2>
Birdie sighed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#164:2>
&ldquo; Why ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#165:2>
I thought birds are always happy because they can fly freely in the
sky . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#166:2>
&ldquo; Good imagination .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#167:2>
I am as free as a prisoner , I haven't even flown once . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#168:2>
The kite crackled , &ldquo; Ah !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#169:2>
You are cheating me , you are standing here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#170:2>
Didn't you fly here ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#171:2>
Don't tell me the wind blew you all the way here ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#172:2>
You must be lighter than me then . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#173:2>
&ldquo; I do wish to fly , but I am not allowed to do so .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#174:2>
Birdie yelled , then she piped down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#175:2>
&ldquo; Sorry , I  ' m in a bad mood , I wish I were a kite . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#176:2>
&ldquo; That  ' s stupid ! Being a kite is no good at all , the
string makes me itch . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#177:2>
The kite crackled again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#178:2>
&ldquo; And I  ' m fed up with the strong wind , it makes me dizzy .
&rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#179:2>
&ldquo; But I still want to be a kite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#180:2>
You can fly . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#181:2>
Birdie found it interesting to talk to the kite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#182:2>
Meanwhile , Mama bird was still sitting in the nest , waiting for
the egg to hatch .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#183:2>
&ldquo; It must be a good boy , I can feel his energetic dance in
the egg ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#184:2>
After a while , she snapped , &ldquo; That Birdie has gone out for
hours !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#185:2>
She must be busy finding excuses rather than caterpillars . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#186:2>
Birdie suddenly remembered her chores .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#187:2>
&ldquo; I am sorry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#188:2>
I have to go fetch caterpillars for my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#189:2>
I will come back to say hello when I  ' ve found some . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#190:2>
After finding a few caterpillars , Birdie returned to the
grassland .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#191:2>
When she arrived , her heart sank .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#192:2>
The eagle kite she had talked to was not there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#193:2>
Instead , she found the kite  ' s master , crying loudly and waving
his fists .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#194:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s gone , gone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#195:2>
I  ' ve had it for years .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#196:2>
I want it back , Papa ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#197:2>
The father patted his son  ' s head and said &ldquo; My dear son ,
he  ' s in the woodland .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#198:2>
There are dangerous animals inside .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#199:2>
I  ' ll buy you another kite . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#200:2>
Birdie immediately hopped back into the woodland .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#201:2>
After searching for hours , she found the eagle kite hanging on the
top of an oak tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#202:2>
Birdie hopped to him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#203:2>
&ldquo; Are you alright ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#204:2>
Are you hurt ? &rdquo; she asked Birdie .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#205:2>
The eagle kite sighed , &ldquo; I told you Birdie , a kite  ' s life
is not a good one , I shouldn't have crackled so hard this morning .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#206:2>
<it> Crack Crack </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#207:2>
See , I  ' ll beak into pieces when the rain comes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#208:2>
Don't you hear the thunder rumbling ? &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#209:2>
&ldquo; Without thinking , Birdie picked up the kite  ' s string
with her beak . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#210:2>
&ldquo; No , Birdie , don't Birdie , you will hit by the
lightning ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#211:2>
Birdie knew that she was the only one that could save the kite , and
this knowledge gave her <-> strenghth </-> <+> strength </+> .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#212:2>
She took a deep breath and started the first flight of her life .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#213:2>
After some falling and rising , she manage to balance herself and
she started flying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#214:2>
But it started to rain quite heavily , Birdie found it difficult to
fly on while carrying a big eagle kite that was soaking wet .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#215:2>
&ldquo; <.> S </.> .. Stop Birdie , &rdquo; the kite said in a
helpless voice .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#216:2>
&ldquo; It  ' s no use doing that !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#217:2>
Let me down ! &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#218:2>
After flying for a mile , the kite suddenly yelled &ldquo; LOOK OUT !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#219:2>
A real eagle is behind us ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#220:2>
Birdie gasped and flapped her wings even harder .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#221:2>
&ldquo; I won't let go until the day I die ! &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#222:2>
&ldquo; OPEN YOUR BEAK !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#223:2>
LET ME GO !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#224:2>
BIRDIE !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#225:2>
HIDE ! &ldquo; the eagle kite then snapped the string off his body
and threw himself towards the real eagle .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#226:2>
The eagle and the kite fell , and so did Birdie . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#227:2>
Birdie struggled to get up and hopped to the kite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#228:2>
The real eagle , shocked to have been attacked by a kite , flew off .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#229:2>
&ldquo; <.> Sor </.> ... Sorry , I cannot save you , I am a
useless bird , totally useless , I can only catch caterpillars , but cannot
save my friend , I ... &ldquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#230:2>
&ldquo; Don't blame yourself my dear Birdie , I have told you ,
this is a kite  ' s life &dash; when we are set free , we die .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#231:2>
You have to accept this , you are a bird , not a kite .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#232:2>
See , you can fly now , though you are a bit clumsy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#233:2>
Crack !

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#234:2>
Don't be a crybaby , your mom is waiting for you , go now , forget
me ...

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#235:2>
Crack , Crack . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#236:2>
His crackling sound finally faded away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#237:2>
Birdie gazed at her friend with thoughtful eyes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#238:2>
In the late afternoon , after the rain stopped , Birdie hopped
back to her nest . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#239:2>
&ldquo; WHY SO LATE ? &ldquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#240:2>
Mama bird asked Birdie in a harsh tone .

<ICE-HK:W2F-007#241:2>
&ldquo; Don't mention the rain , if you had come back earlier , you
would have escaped the rain . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#242:2>
Birdie did not answer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#243:2>
&ldquo; So let me have a look at the caterpillar you have found
today . &ldquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-007#244:2>
It was a dead one . </p> </I>
