Thousands of people every day put their views into words and
pictures and publish them on the World Wide Web .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#4:1>
Blogging &obrack;  short for Web logging &cbrack; has penetrated all corners of online
society .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#5:1>
Now blogging is coming to a mobile phone near you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#6:1>
NewBay Software , based in Dublin , Ireland , claims to have
developed the world  ' s first mobile phone blogging system , aptly named
FoneBlog . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#7:1>
Taking advantage of the growing popularity of camera-equipped
handsets , FoneBlog allows users to instantly publish their photos and
comments on a personal Web page that can be viewed online . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#8:1>
&ldquo; Operators throughout the world see FoeBlog as the perfect
application to drive multimedia messaging &obrack;  MMS &cbrack; and data traffic , and
increase camera phone and PDA &obrack;  personal digital assiatant &cbrack; sales , &rdquo;
NewBay Software chief executive officer Paddy Holahan said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#9:1>
&ldquo; FoneBlog offers consistent , long-term revenue for network
operators and unmatched loyalty from consumers . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#10:1>
NewBay is in talks with several European and United States
carriers to implement FoneBlog . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#11:1>
Meanwhile , ucp morgen , based in Vienna , has launched
mobileblog ! , targeted at operators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#12:1>
The product is deployed on ucp  ' s youth-orientated mobile content
portal , and offers the same instant publishing capabilities as FoneBlog .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#13:1>
Ucp chief executive officer Christian Lutz claims 5.5 million
users are blogging on uboot.com , resulting in more than 100 million blogs
and hundreds of thousands of photos . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#14:1>
Allowing photos taken by mobile phones to be published in the
public domain offers intriguing possibilities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#15:1>
Already , news organisations such as the BBC are equipping their
reporters with camera phones to cover breaking events , such as the recent
anti-war protests . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#16:1>
A number of Asian operators , including Hutchison Telecom ,
Sunday Communications and Peoples Telephone in Hong Kong , offer services
that allow subscribers to store photos online . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#17:1>
Nokie  ' s Club Nokie and Samsung  ' s Funzone portals , both
available in Hong Kong , have online photo album services for customers .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#22:2>
There are numerous reasons why corporations look to outsource
their information technology infrastructure to professional services
organisations , but none is more pronounced than cost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#23:2>
In this tough economic climate , outsourcing internal IT systems
can save as much as 40 per cent on IT capital expenditure , says Fujitsu Hong
Kong  ' s general manager - managed services , information systems &ampersand; services
division , Toby Tsang Kwok-hing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#24:2>
&ldquo; We can achieve savings of 10 per cent to 20 per cent
easily in the first year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#25:2>
Depending on the existing IT system and how it was managed in the
first place , we can achieve as much as 30 per cent to 40 per cent savings
over a reasonable amount of time , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#26:2>
In addition to saving money , IT outsourcing offers intangible
benefits for corporate management and end-users . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#27:2>
By outsourcing IT purchasing and maintenance to companies such as
Fujitsu , corporations eliminate the complexity of having to manage ongoing
relationships with multiple vendors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#28:2>
&ldquo; For large corporations , there can be hundreds of
contracts with different IT vendors that need to be monitored and renewed at
regular intervals .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#29:2>
The process is so complex it often requires a couple of full-time
staff to manage internally . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#30:2>
By outsourcing their IT system to Fujitsu , corporations will be
left with one contract to deal with .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#31:2>
Corporations also benefit from the economy-of-scale enjoyed by major
IT outsourcing providers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#32:2>
&ldquo; Because Fujitsu is handling the purchasing for multiple
companies , we can leverage the size of our purchasing power to negotiate
better prices , service responses and so on , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#33:2>
End-users on a corporate intranet can benefit from IT outsourcing
, which typically results in a professionally run IT system , with less
downtime and better response time in case of problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#34:2>
But lowering cost is not the only reason companies are turning to
IT outsourcing .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#35:2>
A growing number of Hong Kong companies are looking to IT outsourcing
to improve their competitiveness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#36:2>
Martin Chan , senior vice-president , PCCW Business eSolutions &obrack; 
HK &cbrack; , outsourcing &ampersand; managed services , said: &ldquo; The main driver for IT
outsourcing for companies is to improve their competitiveness in the face of
cost restraints .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#37:2>
Corporations are starting to realise other critical benefits , such
as the ability to focus on their core business , faster time to market and
access to professional skill sets . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#38:2>
Without outsourcing , a company looking to introduce new
applications and services to improve competitiveness must equip staff with
new skills or hire staff with those skills , which often delay the launch of
those services or require more management resources to get the job done .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#39:2>
&ldquo; Outsourcing the implementation of those new applications
and services to a professional services organisation allows the company to
access the latest technical expertise quickly and cost effectively so they
can focus on their core business , &rdquo; Mr Chan said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#40:2>
Service vendors such as PCCW now allow companies to try new
applications before they make an investment in the systems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#41:2>
&ldquo; One of the biggest benefits of outsourcing is it allows
corporations to access the latest technology at very low risk .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#42:2>
Instead of buying the application , installing it and managing it ,
we can offer companies a chance to try out the latest applications before
they have to make the investment for those systems . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#43:2>
Another emerging trend is companies are looking to cut cost and
restructure their cost . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#44:2>
&ldquo; Many corporations are now taking the money they have
saved through outsourcing their IT systems to invest in new systems and
applications that boost their overall business . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#45:2>
Because outsourcing contracts actually help spread the cost of
new investments over an extended period , corporations have the flexibility
to invest in new systems earlier . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#46:2>
Without outsourcing , a company implementing a new IT system will
have to come up with the whole investment at the start of the implementation
cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#47:2>
By spreading that initial investment over the span of an outsourcing
contract , corporations free up financial resources that can be invested in
other areas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#48:2>
Mr Tsang said the war in Iraq would boost demand for disaster
recovering services in the IT outsourcing sector . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#52:3>
China  ' s entry into the World Trade Organisation is expected to
spur a boom in information technology outsourcing services in both Hong Kong
and the mainland . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#53:3>
As the amount of foreign investment increases , IT outsourcing
firms are gearing up for a wave of demand for wholesale outsourcing services .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#54:3>
&ldquo; New multinational corporations entering China will
require outsourcing as a way to set up their business quickly and without
considerable initial capital investment , &rdquo; said Victor Wang , general
manager of managed services , HP Services , Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#55:3>
Mr Wang said it could take months for companies without existing
offices in China to set up support infrastructure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#56:3>
&ldquo; With HP  ' s outsourcing solution , that telephone line ,
plus a laptop computer configured for the Internet , could be waiting for the
first project manager who arrives in China , &rdquo; Mr Wang said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#57:3>
His message is echoed by all the major IT outsource providers ,
including Electronic Data Systems &obrack;  EDS &cbrack; , IBM , Fujitsu and Hong Kong  ' s
PCCW , which is increasingly looking to capitalise on the growth north of the
border . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#58:3>
The demand for outsourcing services is also growing as pre-WTO
investment incentives are removed to make way for international standards of
competition . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#59:3>
In the past , favourable investment terms such as tax incentives
and import tax exemptions gave companies a time cushion to generate returns
and freed them to spend on IT . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#60:3>
This is no longer the case . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#61:3>
&ldquo; Without those incentives , foreign firms need to get to
market as soon as possible and with the least amount of initial investment ,
&rdquo; Mr Wang said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#62:3>
&ldquo; Outsourcing their IT and non-core operations now makes
sense to them . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#63:3>
Benjamin Wong , vice-president , Greater China and Korea , at EDS
Electronic Data System , said large domestic organisations in China  ' s
banking , government and telecoms sectors were also increasingly aware of the
benefits of outsourcing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#64:3>
He said large Chinese corporations were already engaging
consultancy services in an effort to improve their competitiveness and to
adopt new services , such as credit cards . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#65:3>
With little local experience in these sectors , outsourcing was
the only way for Chinese financial institutions to access valuable industry
skills and learn from international best practices , Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#66:3>
The September 11 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq have led
to a growing demand for disaster recovering services in the IT outsourcing
sector , according to Toby Tsang Kwok-hing , general manager for managed
services , at Fujitsu Hong Kong  ' s information systems and services unit .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#67:3>
&ldquo; We have had a lot of inquiries about disaster recovery
systems since 9/11 , &rdquo; Mr Tsang said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#68:3>
&ldquo; More and more companies are now aware of the need for
disaster recovery . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#69:3>
Hundreds of millions of dollars of IT equipment and the data on
them was wiped out in the tragedy , leaving companies scrambling to recover
their corporate data . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#70:3>
With the war in Iraq and the sense of foreboding that terrorist
retaliation is only a matter of time , companies are turning to vendors such
as Fujitsu to ensure that their corporate data will survive any potential
attacks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#71:3>
Looking forward , China is poised to become a major base for
outsourcing services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#72:3>
Mr Tsang said China  ' s entry into the WTO would bring increased
competition in essential support services such as telecommunications , which
would lower the overall cost of operating in China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#73:3>
Combined with lower import tax on equipment such as computer
hardware under its WTO obligations , this could turn China into the prime
location for infrastructure such as data or call centres , Mr Tsang said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#74:3>
Despite its potential , China also presents challenges for IT
outsourcing providers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#75:3>
While programmers and engineers are relatively easy to find ,
more experienced talent is hard to come by and even harder to retain . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#76:3>
&ldquo; Low-level programmers and engineers are easily available
but higher-level systems architects and analysts are still in short supply ,
&rdquo; Mr Wong said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#77:3>
Mr Wang added: &ldquo; What happens is that we invest in the
person and train him or her to our standards , then someone hires them at
several times the salary .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#78:3>
It is hard to compete . &rdquo; </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#79:3>
<bold> FLEXIBLE VENDOR OFFERS CLIENTS A PAY-AS-YOU-USE SERVICE
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#80:3>
<bold> Vendors of information technology outsourcing are adopting
more fluid price models that approach the pay-as-you-use system of utility
service providers . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#81:3>
<bold> HP  ' s managed services division allows its customers to
pay for only the resources they use instead of entering a rigid contract that
cannot adapt to their changing needs . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#82:3>
<bold> &ldquo; Today  ' s business environment changes all the time .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#83:3>
We cannot expect our customers not to change , &rdquo; said Victor
Wang , general manager , managed services , HP Services Hong Kong . </bold>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#84:3>
<bold> While typical outsourcing contracts extend for years on a
pre-negotiated price , HP now offers its customers the option of readjusting
their payment on a quarterly basis depending on the amount of resources they
use . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#85:3>
<bold> &ldquo; We are trying to find the exact match for demand ,
&rdquo; Mr Wang said . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#86:3>
<bold> For example , customers paying for a two-hour response
time as part of their service level agreement &obrack;  SLA &cbrack; might only need a
four-hour response time due to improved systems quality .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#87:3>
In this case , HP would allow their clients to re-adjust their SLAs
to reduce their IT outsourcing fees , he said . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#88:3>
<bold> At the same time , HP offers companies flexibility when
developing new systems . Customers can request new equipment , such as a
laptop computer , using this pricing scheme . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#89:3>
<bold> &ldquo; IT outsourcing is now like a utility .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#90:3>
Corporations can now use just what they need and they pay for only
what they use , &rdquo; Mr Wang said . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#91:3>
<bold> HP will even reduce fees if a company no longer requires
as many services . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#92:3>
<bold> &ldquo; It might sound computer-intuitive , but this way
we succeed because we help our customers succeed in what they are doing . It  ' s
a win-win situation , &rdquo; Mr Wang said . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#98:4>
Companies looking for more than a basic outsourcing partner to
handle their information technology requirements can choose a new methodology
in engaging service providers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#99:4>
Value-based outsourcing is gaining popularity in mature markets
such as Australia , where about 25 per cent of new outsourcing contracts are
in this category . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#100:4>
Hong Kong companies can now expect outsourcing providers to be
accountable for the products and services they provide . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#101:4>
Value-based outsourcing incorporates a new dynamic pricing
structure that is partly determined by measuring the value of the services
provided to a customer  ' s business performance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#102:4>
Value-based outsourcing is a break from the conventional model
of simple cost-based pricing for outsourcing services , says Atos Origin
Hong Kong general manager Witman Hung .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#103:4>
&ldquo; Traditionally , customers want to drive the cost down and
the service level up , &rdquo; Mr Hung said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#104:4>
&ldquo; What happens is the service provider goes in and offers
a price which they feel can cover the cost of providing a certain service
level , plus a margin so they can make some money . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#105:4>
&ldquo; But then the motivation for the service provider is to
provide the minimum service level at the lowest cost .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#106:4>
There is no incentive to improve the service level . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#107:4>
With this model , &ldquo; you get what you pay for , nothing
more , nothing less" . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#108:4>
The proposition of value-based outsourcing to business is simple .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#109:4>
Value-based outsourcing offers all the benefits of having a reliable
and efficient IT outsourcing partner and one that will take interest in
improving critical business metrics such as profitability , time-to-market
and overall productivity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#110:4>
A typical value-based outsourcing deal would include a basic fee
for the standard outsourcing service and clearly defined business objectives
as a result of the partnership . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#111:4>
These can be as simple as a guarantee for systems uptime beyond
a bare minimum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#112:4>
For example , the contractual fee is based on a guarantee uptime
of 98 per cent , but the service provider gets an extra bonus for achieving
more than 99 per cent uptime on a consistent basis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#113:4>
More complex deals can go as far as calculating productivity
gains , whereby the outsourcing provider guarantees a minimum productivity
level and receives a small fee for every unit produced thereafter . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#114:4>
&ldquo; What we are saying is to add some incentive for the
outsource provider so there is a reason to improve the service level ,
&rdquo; Mr Hung said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#115:4>
&ldquo; So , if we can help a customer improve their
profitability , improve their time to market by deploying new systems , or
new tools , then we get a bonus for doing so .

<ICE-HK:W2B-033#116:4>
It is the same as employee reward schemes . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#117:4>
The new approach is particularly important in today  ' s rapidly
evolving technology , where new systems can offer significant performance
improvements , hence competitive advantages , with each upgrade . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#118:4>
&ldquo; With value-based outsourcing in place , the service
provider will have an incentive to invest in new systems and the customers
reap the benefits - it  ' s a win-win situation . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#119:4>
The obvious complexity of such a relationship means value-based
outsourcing does not suit every company . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#120:4>
It often takes months to build up a working relationship with a
customer and more months of negotiations and due diligence to understand the
business goals of the customer . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-033#121:4>
&ldquo; We are only offering the value-based outsourcing model
to a select number of customers who we feel we can have a long term
relationship with , &rdquo; Mr Hung said . </p>

</I>
