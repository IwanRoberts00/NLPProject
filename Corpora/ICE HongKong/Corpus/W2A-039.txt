<bold> On the Requirements of Designated Refuge Floors in High-rise
Buildings </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#2:1>
<bold> Abstract: </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#3:1>
In the recent decade , high-rise/ultra high-rise buildings have
been erected throughout Hong Kong Fire safety of the occupants in these
buildings is one of the major concern of building designers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#4:1>
An evacuation system is not the first step of fire safety design in
buildings , yet it cannot be eliminated , as a hazard free environment cannot
be provided .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#5:1>
In relation to the escape from high-rise buildings , the introduction
of designated refuge floors has been stipulated in the newly published Code
of Practice on Means of Escape of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#6:1>
Such requirement has a major influence on the design of high-rise
buildings , yet its usefulness is not fully explored .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#7:1>
This paper discusses on the conceptual idea of using designated refuge
floor and introduces some ongoing research areas. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#8:1>
<bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#9:1>
In view of the growth of population , changes in family structure
, and an increase in business activities , the demand for built space in Hong
Kong has grown rapidly in the past two decades .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#10:1>
Numerous high-rise or ultra high-rise buildings <fnr> </fnr> have
been erected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#11:1>
Office , commercial and private residential buildings erected in the
recent decade are commonly over 40 storeys .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#12:1>
This implies that a large number of people in Hong Kong live and work
at a high level .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#13:1>
There is no doubt that the government authorities , the building
designers as well as the people of Hong Kong are concerned for the safety of
the occupants inside these buildings especially under fire or emergency
situations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#14:1>
In relation to the escape from high-rise buildings , the Hong Kong
Government has stipulated in the Code of Practice on Means of Escape &obrack;  1 &cbrack; 
that designated refuge floors should be provided in some of these buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#15:1>
The provision of an area for refuge is not a new concept .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#16:1>
For example , in the NFPA101 Life safety Code &obrack;  2 &cbrack; , the functions of
areas of refuge are expressed as to improved the usability of means of egress
for some occupants of the building , and to provide greater flexibility in
the provision of means of egress .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#17:1>
However , the requirement to designated a complete floor for refuge
purpose is apparently not included in the fire codes of most developed
countries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#18:1>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#19:1>
This paper provides a discussion on the use of designated refuge
floor taking into account the views from different parties .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#20:1>
In addition , a brief introduction about the author  ' s ongoing
research works related to this aspect is given </p> . <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#21:1>
<bold> Backgrounds </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#22:1>
Fire safety design in building is one of the major aspects that
should be scrutinized by the Building authority prior to approval of general
building plans .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#23:1>
The fire safety design is mainly governed by the prescriptive codes
of practices published by the Buildings Department and the Fire
Services Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#24:1>
Of all the fire codes , the Code of Practice on Means of Escape
was the first published and came 9into operation of 1st January 1960 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#25:1>
It provides guidance for the design of the sizes and capacities of
various building elements in respect to evacuation purpose .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#26:1>
Although some minor amendments have been added to the code over the
intervening years , the majority of the requirements have not been updated
since its first publication .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#27:1>
In 1990 , the Hong Kong Government decided to update the requirements
in the code and a working party on the review of the Code of Practice on
Means of Escape was established .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#28:1>
Subsequent to the extensive consultation , the new edition of the
code of practice was published in late 1996 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#29:1>
One of the contentious requirements in the new code is the provision
of designated refuge floor(s &cbrack; in high-rise buildings. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#30:1>
<bold> Some Regulators ' View on the use of Refuge Floors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#31:1>
In the code , a refuge floor is considered as part of the exit
route in buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#32:1>
It acts as a safe place for a short rest before people continue to
escape downwards as it is difficult for most people to walk down a tall
building without pausing &obrack;  5 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#33:1>
It also acts as a safe passage for people using one staircase , when
encountering smoke , fire or obstruction in that staircase and enables them
to proceed to an alternative staircase .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#34:1>
Additionally , it acts as a place of assembly for people to wait for
rescue in case none of the staircases can be used due to smoke , fire or
obstruction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#35:1>
Obviously , the refuge floor is considered as a temporary safe
place for the evacuees under fire situations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#36:1>
It is a placed adopted temporarily to reduce the effective &ldquo;
travelling height &rdquo; of the evacuees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#37:1>
The major functions of a refuge floor are: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#38:1>
i &cbrack; acting as a relief area for the evacuees under fire
situations; ii &cbrack; acting as a subbase for firefighting purpose; iii &cbrack; acting as
a command point by the rescue personnel to assist orderly evacuation of the
building; and iv &cbrack; acting as a place allowing the disable or partially
disabled to wait for assistance before being evacuate to a place of ultimate
safety . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#39:1>
The prime principle of life safety from fire in a building is
that there should be a minimum of two staircases for the occupants to leave
in order to ensure that at least one exit route is available at all times .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#40:1>
However , there may still be the chance that all the staircases are
blocked off .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#41:1>
For example , in summer , 1995 , a fire occurred in a 10-storey
residential/commercial building in North Point , Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#42:1>
All the staircases were blocked by smoke before all the occupants had
left the building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#43:1>
Under these circumstances about 30 to 40 evacuees escaped to the roof
to await rescue &obrack;  6 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#44:1>
In this case , the roof served as a refuge area and eventually all
the people were rescued .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#45:1>
However , in some buildings , not all the staircases may lead to the
roof and in some modern buildings , the roof forms may be either covered or
pitched .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#46:1>
In such buildings , if all the staircases were blocked by fire , the
occupants ' lives would be at risk and refuge floors offer a safe alternative.
</p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#47:1>
<bold> The Criteria in a Achieving the Objectives </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#48:1>
It has been mentioned &obrack;  7 &cbrack; that evacuees will normally experience
fatigue while travelling in a downward direction after approaching nearly
about 5 minutes &obrack;  i.e .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#49:1>
about 300 seconds &cbrack; and 1 minute in an upward direction .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#50:1>
The average speed of the evacuees ' travel down one storey with normal
headroom of 2.8m per floor is about 16 seconds &obrack;  8 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#51:1>
In this connection , the fatigue will be in when the evacuees have
travelled about 18 storeys downward .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#52:1>
Based on this aspect , if the refuge floor is adopted as a &ldquo;
rest place" , then the logical location of refuge floors is at about 18
storey intervals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#53:1>
By allowing some deviation in storey height for different buildings
and for different rate of movement of people , the Hong Kong  ' s new code &obrack;  1 &cbrack; 
has stated that refuge floors should be provided in all buildings exceeding
25 storeys at intervals of 20 storeys to 25 storeys. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#54:1>
To perform these functions well , a refuge floor should be a safe
and comfortable place to stay in order to reduce the stress level of the
evacuees during escape .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#55:1>
It should have sufficient area to accommodate most of the occupants
who are expected to temporarily halt at the floor &obrack;  5 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#56:1>
It should have adequate headroom , lighting , ventilation as well as
guidance signage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#57:1>
As the refuge floor is considered a temporary safe place , it should
have sufficient fire resisting properties &obrack;  2 hours Fire Resisting Period)
and adequate ventilation to prevent the retention of smoke &obrack;  the area for
refuge should be open-sided on at least two sides to provide adequate cross
ventilation &cbrack; &obrack;  1 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#58:1>
The design and layout of exit staircases requires evacuees to
discharge into the refuge floor before being permitted to proceed downwards .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#59:1>
By this method , the control of the evacuation process may be
instituted at every refuge floor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#60:1>
The process can be illustrated by Figure 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#61:1>
As water that may accumulate on a refuge floor will affect the
safety use of the area for refuge , a refuge floor should be suitably
waterproof and drained. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#62:1>
The refuge floor mentioned above is considered as part of the
exit system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#63:1>
It serves as an interim rest place for the people under evacuation
and therefore , it is important to ensure that the area is free from
obstructions with well-maintained signage and lighting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#64:1>
Good management therefore plays an essential role in maintaining the
function of a refuge floor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#65:1>
Adequate stimulating features , such as signage , should be
provided at appropriate locations to assist in the wayfinding process .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#66:1>
At the point of discharge and re-entry into exits , interactive
emergency signs and voice communication methods may be used to direct
evacuees &obrack;  5 &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#67:1>
<bold> The Psychological Reaction of People </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#68:1>
Apart from the points discussed above , the psychological effect
of using refuge floor should need to consider as evacuation process involves
people  ' s behavioral reactions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#69:1>
The use of a refuge floor may psychologically assist the people under
evacuation process as this action involves a spatial problem solving process
[ 9 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#70:1>
Cognitive mapping plays a central role in the people  ' s ability to
solve spatial problem &obrack;  10 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#71:1>
The refuge floor that has been stored as an image within the users'
cognitive map can influence the movement of the individual .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#72:1>
This cognitive map will be built up by rehearsed fire drills that are
considered essential in any properly managed high-rise building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#73:1>
This familiarity will encourage the users to approach the focal point
- the refuge floor and organize their way to leave the building in a rational
and controlled manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#74:1>
Under emergency situations , the people will experience
environmental stress .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#75:1>
There are three types of personal control , namely behavioral control
, cognitive control and decisional control that people can exert over
threatening circumstances &obrack;  11 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#76:1>
The behavioral control refers to actions that can directly modify the
threatening event such as extinguishing the fire .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#77:1>
Cognitive control refers to the way an individual interprets the
threatening event .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#78:1>
The presence of refuge floor can reassure users that the height of
their escape is not extensive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#79:1>
The refuge floor serves as an image of safe place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#80:1>
The decisional control is defined in terms of the range of choices
available to an individual .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#81:1>
During evacuation from the highest floors of an ultra high-rise
building , the refuge floor can serve as an intermediate point where the
evacuees can have the choice of taking a rest , waiting for rescue or
continuing the escape .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#82:1>
Obviously , the refuge floor can psychologically assist the evacuees
in reducing their stress during evacuation by offering cognitive and
decisional control. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#83:1>
The refuge floor can serve as a basis for the firemen to fight
the fire .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#84:1>
Once people have reached a refuge floor and see fire fighters there ,
they will be psychologically relieved and more confident of their personal
safety .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#85:1>
It may be due to the fact that a firefighter is in general a sign of
safety in an evacuee  ' s cognitive image .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#86:1>
The primary concept of refuge floors is to provide a place for a
break and to release the people  ' s stress when they proceed down to the
ultimate place of safety. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#87:1>
Moreover , at the refuge floor , passenger lifts not serving the
fire floor can , with the assistance of fire fighters , also be used for
people evacuating from the refuge floors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#88:1>
One of the arguments of not using lift for evacuation is that it is
difficult to control the crowd movement if most of the people are under
stress .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#89:1>
Psychologically , the stress of the people at the refuge floor may be
reduced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#90:1>
It may be feasible for the rescue personnel to control the evacuation
process by using lifts .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#91:1>
This is particularly important where the elderly , children or
handicapped users are involved in the evacuation process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#92:1>
In order to &ldquo; reinforce &rdquo; the image of refuge floors
in the cognitive maps of the evacuees , the users of the building should be
informed that the existence of refuge floors in the building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#93:1>
A plan showing the relative locations of refuge floors should be
placed in a conspicuous part of the building such as at the main lift lobby .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#94:1>
In addition , the general public should be educated that refuge
floors are provided in high-rise/ ' ultra high-rise buildings and they are
used as temporary safe places .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#95:1>
If such ideas have been formulated in people  ' s minds , the stress
level of those people situated at extremely high levels may be reduced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#96:1>
Staff training , the establishment of contingency planning and fire
drills can be adopted to reinforce the refuge floor image. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#97:1>
<bold> Some Arguments </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#98:1>
The use of refuge floors in high-rise buildings as introduced by
the new Hong Kong code was questioned by the construction professionals in
that: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#99:1>
i &cbrack; Corridors and staircases are the protected routes of an exit
system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#100:1>
These components are adequate to guide the evacuees to leave the
building and an interim safe place may lead to &ldquo; extended travel
&rdquo; and seems unnecessary .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#101:1>
ii &cbrack; The fatigue that happens for some evacuees under extended travel
in staircases may not create too much of a problem unless the density inside
the staircase is so high that obstruction occurs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#102:1>
iii &cbrack; It is doubtful whether the evacuees will stay in the refuge
floor and await rescue .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#103:1>
The refuge floor seems merely useful for those who find difficulty
in escape . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#104:1>
<bold> Discussion on the Arguments </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#105:1>
Travel in the protected routes may not be arduous if the
building is not substantially high .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#106:1>
In buildings over 40 storeys , which are commonly found in Hong Kong
, evacuees ' travel time by moving continuously from the topmost floor to the
ground level may require 10 to 12 minutes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#107:1>
Intermediate rest appears necessary for most people .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#108:1>
If the staircase is crowded , such an obstruction may create a
hazard to the evacuees as well as increasing the evacuation time of the
people inside the building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#109:1>
In Hong Kong , most commercial buildings are densely populated and
with these high populations , it may be particularly necessary to designate a
place for refuge in those densely populated commercial buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#110:1>
Nevertheless , a detail study on the effectiveness of refuge floor
with respect to the density of the building may be worth carrying out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#111:1>
In residential buildings , the population density is not as high .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#112:1>
But , the pre-evacuation time may be very long , especially when
most of the occupants are asleep .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#113:1>
The possibility that smoke or fire blocks all the staircases in the
pre-evacuation period may be higher .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#114:1>
Refuge floors may then be necessary to serve as a temporary safe
place in the escape process. </p> <O> TABLE , DIAGRAM , GRAPH,ETC </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#115:1>
The refuge floor is not primarily designed as a place for
evacuees to remain and await for rescue but it may have to perform this role
if all the escape routes below are blocked .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#116:1>
Normally , it should be regarded as a buffer zone to assist the
movement of the people in ultra high-rise buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#117:1>
A dependency on emergency management for effective evacuation of
occupants from ultra high-rise buildings is always a problem .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#118:1>
Thus , a concept where such dependency may be reduced should merit
serious consideration &obrack;  12 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#119:1>
Refuge floors that serve as zones to reduce the effective height of
a building can help engender phased evacuation and to simplify these
processes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#120:1>
If the fire doors of the staircase core are opened , smoke is
able to migrate to the staircase .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#121:1>
The refuge floor can be adopted to segregate the staircases into
segments &obrack;  see figure 1 &cbrack; in order to prevent total smoke logging throughout
the entire staircase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#122:1>
Apart from the arguments mentioned above , the introduction of
refuge floors can cause other problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#123:1>
Maintaining the effectiveness of refuge floors may not be a simple
matter .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#124:1>
In view of the huge demand for floor space , unauthorized building
works and unauthorized changes of use in buildings which can provide readily
available floor space have always been a problem in Hong Kong and in most
Asian countries &obrack;  13 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#125:1>
Refuge floors are readily available spaces that could be misused .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#126:1>
From a management point of view , a refuge area that is an extended
portion of the exit route will be easier to manage than a complete floor
dedicated to refuge purposes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#127:1>
However , from a psychological point of view , the image of an
extended portion of exit route may not be as effective as a complete refuge
floor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#128:1>
The benefits of using refuge floors to release the psychological
stress of the evacuees may be taken in account. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#129:1>
The regulators recognize the importance of good maintenance in
the introduction of refuge floors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#130:1>
In the commentary accompanying the code &obrack;  5 &cbrack; , the building
management in relation to the use of refuge floors has been spelt out .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#131:1>
In order to maintain a clear and unobstructed refuge floor ,
effective statutory control should be considered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#132:1>
The relevant authorities have the duty to carry out regular
inspections of the refuge floors , which is regarded as part of the exit
route .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#133:1>
If an obstruction is noted , a &ldquo; fire hazard abatement notice
&rdquo; &obrack;  under the Fire Services Ordinance &cbrack; or an &ldquo; illegal structure
removal notice &rdquo; &obrack;  Under the Buildings Ordinance &cbrack; may be served to
cause the obstructions to be removed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#134:1>
However , such approaches can only be regarded as passive means of
control .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#135:1>
In practice , its effectiveness should be questioned .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#136:1>
A more positive approach could be the adoption of a certification
system to ensure the efficiency of the refuge floors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#137:1>
The owners of the building would be required to produce a
certificate issued by recognized persons or bodies annually &obrack;  or within a
reasonable period of time &cbrack; to demonstrate the efficiency of the refuge floors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#138:1>
However , such arrangement may need amendment to current
legislation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#139:1>
Apart form the managerial problems , the use of refuge floors
may increase the cost of construction especially where a complete floor for
refuge purposes is incorporated into cross-wall construction as is commonly
found in high-rise residential blocks .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#140:1>
The new code takes into account of this in its provision for
permitting part of the refuge floor to be used for building services &obrack;  with
adequate fire separation &cbrack; and this permits staged pumping , for example , and
other utilities at intermediate levels of the building .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#141:1>
Nevertheless , the cost implication for the provision of refuge
floor may need to be studied against its usefulness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#142:1>
The effectiveness of refuge floor under fire situations may be
impaired if the floor is affected by smoke from lower levels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#143:1>
The current requirements for cross ventilation may not guarantee
that smoke logging will not occur particularly under adverse weather
conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#144:1>
Further studies with respect to this aspect are necessary. </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#145:1>
<bold> Some Ongoing Research works </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#146:1>
There exist some merits of using refuge floors , yet the
effectiveness of refuge floors under fire situations has not been fully
explored .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#147:1>
The effectiveness of refuge floor may be impaired if the floor is
affected by smoke from other levels .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#148:1>
Smoke is one of the major causes of fatalities in fire and the
requirements for cross ventilation in the code cannot guarantee that smoke
logging will not occur particularly under adverse weather conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#149:1>
Despite the importance of the smoke effect on refuge floors ,
the effort devoted by the professionals to study the adequacy of refuge floor
design is scarce .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#150:1>
Perhaps , this may be due to the fact that many building codes in
the world do not prescriptively require the provision of designated refuge
floor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#151:1>
In fact , the existing methods , recommendations and guidelines on
the design of smoke control systems did not address specifically to the
refuge floor design &obrack;  14-20 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#152:1>
Apart from the smoke effect on refuge floor , the evacuation
pattern of occupants inside high-rise buildings with refuge floor should also
be a major area of study. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#153:1>
Recently , the author has successfully obtained research grants
from City University and Universities Research Grant Council to commence some
studies: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#154:1>
the movement of smoke in buildings in relation to different
designs parameters of refuge floors , orientation of the buildings ,
staircases and other environmental factors such as weather using both the
computational and experimental modelling techniques; the hazardous effects
of the smoke to the evacuees in refuge floors; the effect of refuge floor
with respect to the evacuation pattern; and the requirements with respect
to the codification of the refuge floors in Hong Kong . </p>

In studying the smoke movement pattern , it is recognized that
wind flows around buildings have significant effect on the smoke movement
around and inside buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#156:1>
Computational Fluid Dynamics &obrack;  CFD &cbrack; technique has been developed
rapidly over the last decade to evaluate the interaction between wind and
buildings numerically .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#157:1>
However , the evaluation of wind-building-smoke movement interaction
by CFD has received relatively little , if any , attention in the literature
in the past .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#158:1>
In City University of HK , the numerical prediction of wind flows
around three-dimensional buildings has been studied for several years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#159:1>
A computer program-WIND 3D which includes solving the time-averaged
Novier-stokes equations with the standard kai turbulence model by using
the finite difference technique has been developed &obrack;  21 , 22 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#160:1>
WIND 3D can be used to calculate flows over single or groups of
buildings and over flat terrain or uneven terrain , and to predict mean and
fluctuating pressures , turbulence quantities , loads and vibrations for
different wind directions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#161:1>
It is going to extend the model to predict smoke movement under
different weather conditions and to carry out parametric studies on refuge
floor design. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#162:1>
Refuge floor is considered as part of exit system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#163:1>
The prescriptive requirements of refuge floor design appear to be
based on intuitive judgement and/ or simple derivation on the basis of
mechanical flows of evacuees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#164:1>
Development of a comprehensive evacuation model can help to analyze
the effectiveness of the prescriptive rules and assist the establishment of
efficient escape strategy including the use of lifts for evacuation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#165:1>
A system evacuation model on the basis of state space modelling
technique is going to develop .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#166:1>
It is expected that the effectiveness of refuge floor on different
types of buildings may be studied. </p> <h>

<bold> Concluding Remarks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#168:1>
The refuge floor concept may facilitate the evacuation process
in ultra high-rise buildings .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#169:1>
It appears that its image can help to release the stress of the
evacuees .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#170:1>
It serves as a buffer zone and simplify the evacuation process
whilst acting as a basepoint for the firefighters and rescue personnel to
initiate escape by using lifts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-039#171:1>
The provision of refuge is a prescriptive requirement in the
Code of Practice .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#172:1>
Such a provision appears to be desirable by the regulators as it
relates to simple rules and has administrative convenience .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#173:1>
In order to explore the effectiveness of using refuge floor ,
comprehensive studies and long-term monitoring in all aspects including
technical , social and economic aspects should be carried out .

<ICE-HK:W2A-039#174:1>
The author has started to carry out some studies and results will be
published in coming articles. </p>
