<bold> Need for transparency </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#2:1>
No one disputes that the Hong Kong Government has the right to bar
anyone it wishes from entering the territory without assigning any reason .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#3:1>
So there is no suggestion that the authorities acted outside the law
when they refused entry to the exiled mainland dissident Harry Wu Hongda ,
even though he was allowed in on an earlier occasion . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#4:1>
Our only concern is that refusing people entry into Hong Kong
without clear reasons being given could dilute the territory  ' s unique
character .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#5:1>
Under &ldquo; one country , two systems &rdquo; Hong Kong has remained
a free-wheeling city where people of all kinds of beliefs and political
persuasions have been free to live and work , restricted only by the need to
abide by the laws of the territory .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#6:1>
This is why dissidents exiled from the mainland have been able to live
here . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#7:1>
The Falun Gong , banned as an evil cult on the mainland , is free
to practise in Hong Kong . Li Shaomin , the City University academic
convicted as a spy by the mainland , was still able to return to Hong Kong
and work here .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#8:1>
The arrival in Hong Kong of another exiled mainlander , Huang Beiling
, which we have reported today , is a welcome indication of Hong Kong  ' s
openness .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#9:1>
This open quality , as well as its legal system and its
business-friendly environment , are what make Hong Kong what it is .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#10:1>
It is these qualities that distinguish the territory and help it
compete with other cities in China .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#11:1>
If Hong Kong is to achieve its ambition of becoming a world city , it
is important that it remains a place where different kinds of ideas and
thoughts can be freely expressed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#12:1>
Which is why we would urge the authorities to first exercise the
greatest caution before preventing anyone from entering Hong Kong , and
second to provide an indication of the reasons for such action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#13:1>
It is true that most countries make decisions on the entry of
foreigners without revealing why .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#14:1>
In Hong Kong  ' s case , we believe it is important for the authorities
to go the extra mile and be transparent about these decisions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#15:1>
If the authorities believed that Harry Wu was coming to Hong Kong to
conspire against the mainland , then saying so would strengthen their case .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#16:1>
Not everyone would agree with the decision , but they would
understand and respect the reasons behind it .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#17:1>
Transparency should be seen as a strength , not as a weakness . </p>

<h> <bold> A step forward </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#19:2>
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa  ' s launch of the accountability
system for principal officials will mark a milestone in Hong Kong  ' s evolving
political system . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#20:2>
With the creation of a new layer of political appointees who will
be answerable to the Chief Executive , and held accountable to him for policy
blunders , the civil service will no longer be responsible for creating
government policies .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#21:2>
The job of civil servants will be to execute policies formulated by
the new appointees . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#22:2>
The most fundamental change lies in splitting the dual role of
departmental administrator and policy-maker currently performed by
secretaries and bureau chiefs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#23:2>
Under the new system , permanent under-secretaries , who will be
civil servants , will run the bureaus , while the politically appointed
principal officials will be responsible for the political job of making
policies and seeking public support . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#24:2>
For the first time in Hong Kong  ' s history , all the principal
officials in charge of policy portfolios will sit on the Executive Council ,
turning it into a functional cabinet , instead of an advisory body consisting
of part-timers , as it is now . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#25:2>
The changes are being made for the sake of enhancing the quality
of governance .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#26:2>
They are a belated response to calls for more accountability by a
government that has lurched from one blunder to another over the past five
years without any senior officials being disciplined . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#27:2>
Mr Tung hopes that his new batch of &ldquo; ministers" , driven
by a sense of commitment and dedication , will do a better job of
implementing his policies and respond to public demands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#28:2>
It remains to be seen if the changes will really make things
easier for him.

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#29:2>
For one thing , the reform has not addressed the fundamentally
confrontational relationship between the executive authorities and the
legislature , whose members are constitutionally confined to acting as an
opposition barred from ever governing Hong Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#30:2>
The absence of a &ldquo; government party in the legislature will
remain a headache for the politically appointed principal officials , just as
it has been for their civil servant predecessors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#31:2>
There has been talk of Mr Tung seeking to form a ruling coalition
with one or two parties by appointing their members to the Executive Council .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#32:2>
However , both the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong have had members sitting on the council over the past
five years . But that has not manifestly helped Mr Tung in getting the two
parties ' support in the legislature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#33:2>
In that sense , one could argue that , apart from giving Mr Tung
free rein to appoint people who share his vision to become his lieutenants ,
the only significant change that the reform will bring is that it will anchor
the political neutrality of the civil service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#34:2>
Civil servants brought up as bureaucratic administrators , but
finding themselves having to field politically motivated attacks as they move
up the ladder , will in future be able to concentrate on the job of executing
policies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#35:2>
However , hard he tried to put on a brave face about his
legitimacy , Mr Tung  ' s limited electoral mandate will remain his weakest
spot as he and his ministers cross swords with legislatures returned by much
bigger electorates .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#36:2>
It is important that after 2007 , the chief executive is elected
through a more representative system , so that he has as much popular
legitimacy as Legco . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#37:2>
The demand of legislators to play a role in scrutinising
candidates for principal officials is not unreasonable .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#38:2>
Though the SAR Government is executive-led , giving Legco power to
vet candidates will provide a useful check to an abuse of executive power .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#39:2>
Until the elected legislators are given a greater role suggesting
policy options , it is hard to see how Mr Tung  ' s new team will be able to
reduce mindless point-scoring fights with legislators and enhance the
efficiency of the governing machinery . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#40:2>
Mr Tung has declared that this new system will result in a
government that is more open , readier to listen to people , and more
responsive to public demands .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#41:2>
We believe it is a useful step in making the government more
accountable . </p>

<h> <bold> No simple answers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#43:3>
If anyone thought economic recovery in the United States would
kickstart Hong Kong  ' s job market , this month  ' s unemployment figures
represent a dose of cold water .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#44:3>
Economic restructuring is a harsh beast and all sectors continue to
show weakness .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#45:3>
Economic insecurity permeates most strata of society . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#46:3>
It is increasingly clear that a rapid rebound in employment
prospects of the sort which occurred in 1999-2000 is unlikely .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#47:3>
Hong Kong faces restructuring in many industries as a result of its
changing economic role .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#48:3>
Firms long-insulated from severe competition must restructure to stay
viable .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#49:3>
Pacific Century CyberWorks is the best example , but there are many
others . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#50:3>
However , we should be cautious about jumping to overly
pessimistic conclusions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#51:3>
Unemployment is a lagging indicator that only improves some months
into an economic recovery .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#52:3>
The increase in the jobless rate to seven per cent in the three-month
period to March , from 6.8 per cent a month earlier , includes seasonal
distortions .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#53:3>
When temporary jobs created over the Lunar New Year holiday period
are accounted for , it seems the underlying rate of joblessness has remained
static during the first quarter of the year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#54:3>
There are no simple answers to the SAR  ' s high jobless rate .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#55:3>
A sustained global expansion will undoubtedly help , given our
dependence on international trade .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#56:3>
The pegged exchange rate forces the whole economy to make a choice
that boils down to either lower wages or higher unemployment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#57:3>
At such times , people inevitably turn to the Government , which
has an important role to play in retraining laid-off workers .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#58:3>
Whether further large scale job creation schemes should be created is
debatable .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#59:3>
For a city economy , Hong Kong has a large public sector and a
growing welfare culture .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#60:3>
While the emergence of a class of long-term unemployed workers
threatens social stability , spending public money for low grade jobs
promises to embed economic stagnation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#61:3>
What is needed is true political vision as to the kind of economy
Hong Kong must become if it is to sustain its standard of living .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#62:3>
That will inevitably be deeply integrated with the Pearl River Delta
and almost entirely focused on high value-added services .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#63:3>
Pressing policy issues revolve around a proposed population policy
and reform of protected domestic sectors if new types of businesses are to
emerge . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#64:3>
Fortunately , this is happening without government involvement .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#65:3>
Sticking with the discipline is the only realistic option . </p>

<h> <bold> Rhetoric and reality </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#67:4>
Admiral Dennis Blair  ' s comments on the role the United States
intends to play in maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait are to be
welcomed .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#68:4>
On the one hand , the commander of US forces in the region reiterated
his country  ' s policy of arming Taiwan to the extent that forcible
reunification by the mainland is not an option .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#69:4>
But he also made it clear that US arms sales to Taiwan were not to be
seen as a move towards creating an independent Taiwan .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#70:4>
He said that a stable military balance across the Taiwan Strait was a
pre-condition to &ldquo; the peaceful achievement of one China , which is
the policy of China , the policy of Taiwan and the policy of the United
States &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#71:4>
While the Chinese Government publicly describes any US role in
the cross-strait relationship as interference in China  ' s internal affairs ,
Washington can play a stabilising role in the relationship between Beijing
and Taipei . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#72:4>
It can do this by ensuring that military action cannot be an
option in deciding the way the relations between Taiwan and the mainland
evolve .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#73:4>
Ensuring such a military balance is the best method of paving the way
for a healthy dialogue between the mainland and Taiwan on their future
relationship . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#74:4>
As Admiral Blair pointed out , the military balance between the
mainland and Taiwan is stable at present and does not provide a basis either
for Taiwanese independence or forcible reunification . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#75:4>
It is important that nothing is done to upset this situation .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#76:4>
An increase in the number of missiles pointing towards Taiwan would
upset this balance , as would the introduction of any new sophisticated
weapons system into Taiwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#77:4>
Despite the angry rhetoric that often spews across the Taiwan
Strait , neither side is spoiling for a fight .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#78:4>
At the same time , they do not appear to be ready for talks and are
poised in a no-man  ' s land between confrontation and dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#79:4>
Washington can play a role in nudging them towards dialogue . </p>

<h> <bold> The clean-up begins </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#81:5>
Geographically , Hong Kong is part of the Pearl River Delta .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#82:5>
As pollution generated on one side of the Shenzhen River impacts the
other , local initiatives to clean up the environment can never be fully
successful unless backed by regional efforts . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#83:5>
The Hong Kong Observatory recently confirmed what has long been
obvious to all - visibility in Hong Kong is now four times worse than it was
30 years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#84:5>
In fact , worsening air pollution does not just affect Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#85:5>
The region as a whole is now shrouded in haze , if not smog , on most
days . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#86:5>
Hong Kong and Guangdong used to indirectly point accusing fingers
at each other for causing the problem .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#87:5>
Guangdong admitted its old coal-fired power plants were spilling out
thick , black smoke and its vehicle exhausts were rich in carbon , sulphur
and lead . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#88:5>
But it also noted that pollutants from Hong Kong could be blown
northward to affect the province - a point accepted by Hong Kong only in
recent years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#89:5>
Now that both sides have put aside that dispute and research has
pinpointed the sources of pollution , it is gratifying that Guangdong has
shown a clear determination to work closely with the SAR to address the
problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#90:5>
Over the next few days , Guangdong is expected to adopt much more
stringent standards on emission and fuel .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#91:5>
Some old coal-fired power plants may even be closed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#92:5>
The measures will not immediately clear the sky , but they are a
good start .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#93:5>
In fact , there is only so much Guangdong can do .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#94:5>
The province alone cannot decree that refineries on the mainland
produce cleaner diesel .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#95:5>
Even after it has adopted stricter standards , vehicles from
provinces using sub-standard fuel will still cause problems as they pass
through Guangdong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#96:5>
The province  ' s efforts to combat water pollution is no less
daunting .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#97:5>
Just cleaning up the tributaries of the Pearl River is a herculean
undertaking .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#98:5>
Although the problem does not directly affect Hong Kong , this is an
area where the SAR  ' s expertise may prove helpful . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#99:5>
Hong Kong had a head start over Guangdong in addressing the
sewage problem .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#100:5>
In the late 1980s , it banned the discharge of animal waste and
untreated sewage into rivers and storm water drains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2E-004#101:5>
Regrettably , these measures pushed some of the most polluting
factories across the border .

<ICE-HK:W2E-004#102:5>
Guangdong has &ldquo; benefited &rdquo; from their relocation , and
it is time it cleaned up the smudge . </p>
