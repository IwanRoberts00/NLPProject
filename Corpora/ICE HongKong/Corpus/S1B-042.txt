<ICE-HK:S1B-042#1:1:A>
Welcome back

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#2:1:A>
In this second half of our program we talk to Andrew Wong <,>
chairman of the working group on salaries and allowances for Legislative
councilors <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#3:1:A>
Mr Wong <,> uhm your request or request of your working group for a
raise in salaries and allowances <,> come uh comes hot on the heels of a very
generous budget <,> uhm proposed by the Financial Secretary

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#4:1:A>
Are you not being opportunistic in <,> trying to get the government
to pay you more at this juncture

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#5:1:B>
Now I have to say that it has nothing to do with the budget

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#6:1:B>
Uh it  ' s been a running battle between the government and the
Legislature <,> at least uh in one uh uh matter and that has to do with
salaries <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#7:1:B>
And what we are asking is not a salaries revision or salaries
adjustment but <,> uh a mechanism whereby uh the salary can be determined <,>
and we have proposed that it should be pegged to a certain point in the civil
service

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#8:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#9:1:A>
This pegging to a certain point in the civil service uhm was that
agreed upon after a lot of deliberation

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#10:1:A>
I ask this because you could of course have pegged against the
salaries of uh judges or bankers or junior civil servants

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#11:1:B>
It can be done that way yes but uh we have uh uh discussed the
matter uh much earlier on back in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one
ninety-two <,> when uh there was an ad hoc group studying the same matter
also chaired by me <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#12:1:B>
And at that time we recommended the government ought to set up an
independent body to make recommendations to government so the government can
on the basis of those recommendations uh prepare an FC item for consideration
by the Finance Committee so as a sort of go-between uh between the
Legislature on the one hand and the government on the other hand <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#13:1:B>
And at that time we suggested that uh the Commission ought to study
<,> uh ought to consider seriously uh a pegging mechanism <,> which uh as we
now point out in fact uh it is in operation in the United Kingdom ever since
nineteen eighty-eight in fact ever since nineteen eighty-three but it was
phased into uh that sort of mechanism

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#14:1:B>
And the case with United States uh congressmen are paid uh uh on a
pegging uh device uh the salaries being pegged to a district court judge
federal district court judge

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#15:1:A>
Uhm if if you peg your salaries uhm to the uh directorate
scale let  ' s say of the civil service does that mean you also peg your
allowances to the directorate scale <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#16:1:A>
For instance are you going to be asking for such things as a
housing allowance <,> which which in the case of directorate grade staff is
substantial

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#17:1:B>
We are simply asking for a pegging pegging mechanism to peg
our salaries with a certain civil service point in terms of a basic salary
only and no fringe benefits <,> because the on-costs would be enormous

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#18:1:B>
For example in the case of the CES <,> uh the salary is about a
hundred fifty thousand dollars per month but the on-costs uh uh uh expressed
in terms you know uh of all kinds of benefits like housing education etcetera
<,> would be as high as <,> another hundred fifteen thousand <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#19:1:B>
In the case of a D one officer the uh salary is about sixty-eight
seventy thousand dollars per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#20:1:B>
The on-costs would be something in the region of sixty thousand per
month <,> but but we are not asking for that

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#21:1:B>
We are simply asking that there ought to be a mechanism whereby our
salary could be determined uh <,> and adjusted uh in future rather
automatically as <,> uh civil service uh pays are adjusted

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#22:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#23:1:A>
That that sounds uh pretty innocuous and and sensible to me uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#24:1:A>
But however if you look at the fine prints then pegging uh
Legislative councilors  '  salaries to for instance D four in the directorate
scale would mean an increase of over a hundred percent

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#25:1:B>
But if you look at the fine print in uh in our report we were
not suggesting that
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#> We uh our salaries ought to be pegged at D four

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#26:1:B>
It was simply an example <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#27:1:B>
We are saying that in uh adopting the pegging mechanism perhaps uh
practices in other parliaments in parliaments in other countries ought to be
uh ought to be considered ought to be taken into consideration

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#28:1:B>
For example in the UK <,> uh MPs  '  pay uh is pegged to eighty-nine
percent <,> of the pay of the maximum point of a <{> <[> senior </[>
principal which would be fairly high ranking administrative officer in the UK
civil service

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#29:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#30:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#31:1:A>
Let us consider some matters of principle

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#32:1:A>
For instance in your working group do you have uhm <,> members who
are not part of the Legislative Council or the civil service <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#33:1:A>
Do you have outside input because it seems to me you  ' re you  ' re
pushing for your own salary increase and then you are you are going to vote
for it too

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#34:1:B>
We we we are not we are doing no such <,> uh thing at all <,>
uh as uh back in nineteen ninety-two <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#35:1:B>
We simply suggest it because we as the affected party ought to
submit our views to the government and in this case ought to submit our views
to the Independent Commission <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#36:1:B>
We are prepared to accept whatever recommendation the Commission
has but I think members would be most unhappy if <,> uh the pegging mechanism
which we recommended a long time ago uh uh is not uh being acceded to because
it would uh pose as a as a as a source of future wrangle between this between
the government and the Legislature because there is no uh impartial uh way of
determining what the salary level ought to be

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#37:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#38:1:A>
Let us look at another point of principle and that is of course in
the UK all members of parliament are full-time <{> <[> <,> right </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#39:1:B>
<[> No they are not </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#40:1:B>
There is no full time requirement in the UK parliament

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#41:1:B>
It  ' s all a question of time demand on MPs

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#42:1:B>
Uh it is up to them uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#43:1:B>
They are free to uh whether to take up outside other employment <,>
and in fact they are allowed to do so <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#44:1:B>
<{> <[> So </[> we are simply saying that uh uh uh calculating the
basis of time demand on members <,> the theoretical one

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#45:1:B>
On the average we spend something like hundred and twenty hours per
month or we are expected to spend one twenty hours per month simply on
meetings and preparation for meetings <,> and not counting constituency work

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#46:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#47:1:A>
Let me <{> <[> try another </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#48:1:B>
<[> So uh </[> </{> it is up to the electorate I mean up to
the member of concerned to uh decide whether or not you you would take up
outside other employment <,> and up to the electorate to uh decide whether or
not the person ought to be returned at the next election

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#49:1:A>
Yes but they  ' re dealing with matters of state
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#> They have a
full Legislative program in the House of Commons <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#50:1:A>
I mean very few of them would be able to look after their own
businesses <,> aside from being a member of parliament <,> but in Hong Kong
we have a <,> somewhat different situation <,> in that for instance Mr Wong
some of the members are appointed
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#> They are not elected <,> and they they
have full-fledged jobs and careers

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#51:1:B>
Appointed members will disappear come nineteen ninety-five in
the first place

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#52:1:B>
In the second place <,> in the House of Commons there are six
hundred and fifty members and if you count uh the number of members who also
join committees of the Commons I think <?> it </?> would be a handful only

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#53:1:B>
In the case of front benchers in uh on the government side the the
in addition to MP  ' s pay <,> they are also entitled to ministerial pay so it
is a different system altogether

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#54:1:B>
In fact <,> I would say that not all MPs work full-time in the UK
House of Commons <,> so you <?> aren't </?> comparing really comparing like
with like so we are proposing that we ought to perhaps emulate the pegging
mechanism <,> uh which is operational in the UK <,> and copy it so that there
will not wrangle <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#55:1:B>
And in fact prior to nineteen eighty uh three to eighty-eight when
that was being decided <,> there was a continued battle between the
government and uh and parliament uh on member  ' s pay

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#56:1:A>
But but your your your proposals if accepted will come into
force now <,> whereas uhm the election is not until nineteen ninety-five

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#57:1:A>
So you know for the next two years at least the appointed members
will be entitled the same salaries and allowances as elected members <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#58:1:A>
Now surely that  ' s not fair

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#59:1:B>
I I I <,> don't think I ought to defend uh too vociferously
for the appointed members but uh I think we ought to uh take them as a sort
of transitional uh having a transitional existence

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#60:1:B>
So in the meantime perhaps uh they ought to be uh considered they
ought to be regarded on a par with other members

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#61:1:B>
Uh they will disappear come nineteen ninety-five and that  ' s only
about a year a year or uh a year and a half uh two <unc> 1-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#62:1:B>
And uh and I think that  ' s something we ought to accept <,> but I
have to point uh uh uh add in one more point uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#63:1:B>
We are not asking for a salaries revision uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#64:1:B>
We are asking for a mechanism whereby pay could be determined <,>
by an independent body <,> with the sort with the mechanism of pegging so
that the future uh quarrels and wrangle between the administration and the
Legislature could be avoided

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#65:1:A>
Uhm but if the principle of pegging is accepted you still have
to argue <,> whether this should be pegged as I said to the judge  ' s salary
or to senior civil servants or to junior civil servants or to bankers

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#66:1:B>
We we have uh decided that uh for the consideration of the
Independent Commission they ought to consider <,> a point on the directorate
uh range ranging from D one to D ten <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#67:1:B>
We are not suggesting any point

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#68:1:B>
We would say that the status and the nature of the duties of uh
members of the Legislature ought to uh uh ought to uh merit uh a pegging to a
point in the directorate scale in terms of status <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#69:1:B>
Uh we are not recommending any point

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#70:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#71:1:A>
You you you mentioned the word <mention> status </mention> but of
course you could you could peg it in accordance with something else in
accordance with uh responsibilities <,> with uh numbers of hours worked a
week <,> and according to the survey I read uh directorate staff work much
harder than Legislative councilors in terms of working hours

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#72:1:B>
Uh not necessarily

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#73:1:B>
I it all depends on the secretary concerned <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#74:1:B>
All depends on the member concerned <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#75:1:B>
So when you compare the hardest working uh secretary <,> secretary
I mean secretary uh uh in the sense of a senior civil servant not as personal
secretary <,> uh to the to to the member who doesn't put in a lot of time uh
of course you you you are not comparing uh like with like

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#76:1:A>
Uhm but then of course you also have the problem of uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#77:1:A>
You see if you are a member directorate staff you would have
reached that point after about twenty years or so of service <,> and you
would have uhm have to prove uhm that that you are capable of <.> d </.>
these responsible positions <,> whereas as a Legislative councilor <,> uh you
could be elected <,> one year and you are going to be there for for four year
term and after that you know you you might be elected out of office

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#78:1:B>
But the electoral test is very uh uh is a very stringent test

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#79:1:B>
Uh if one cannot really uh perform uh satisfactory <,> to uh to the
satisfaction of the constituency then next time round he will not be there

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#80:1:B>
And <,> particularly uh uh because of uh uh the <unc> 2-words
</unc> uh uh <,> uh stronger and heavier time demand on members <,> I
think uh it would be uh uh uh right to take into consideration also the fact
that uh members uh may not be able to uh to be re-elected and thereby uh uh
uh <,> it it is important that uh they be paid uh satisfactorily during their
terms of service so that they would not be uh <,> they would not be uh bought
by <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> by whoever has you know ulterior <{2> <[2> motives
</[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#81:1:A>
<[1> I </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#82:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#83:1:A>
Don't don't  '  get me wrong

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#84:1:A>
I  ' m very supportive of the professionalization of politics <,> but
it seems to me that you have got to make your case and convince the public
that this is the right step to take

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#85:1:A>
Now just one final question

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#86:1:A>
Once you have the peg will this be inflation-adjusted

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#87:1:A>
That is to say we don't have to go through this charade you know
every two or three years

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#88:1:B>
It will not be inflation-adjusted

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#89:1:B>
It <.> wil </.> it will be adjusted in accordance with <,> uh civil
service pay adjustments so uh which has an inflation element built into it
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#90:1:B>
So we are asking for that peg and uh uh we would say that a point
uh in uh that range would be appropriate

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#91:1:B>
Uh it could be a percentage of a point uh of a directorate point uh
whichever point that might be <,> nd uh the point uh D four or even D three
might be appropriate <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#92:1:B>
But a certain percentage perhaps uh like the UK it ought to be
eighty-nine percent or eighty-two percent in uh in the case of the the actual
hours being worked out uh by uh in our report we are saying that we spend one
twenty hours uh
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#> The time demand on uh on civil servants would be uh from a
hundred and forty-six thousand
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#> <{> <[> <?> That  ' s eighty-two </?> percent
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-042#93:1:A>
<[> Thank you </[> </{> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#94:1:A>
That  ' s it for this week <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#95:1:A>
Thank you for watching <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#96:1:A>
Same time again next week <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-042#97:1:A>
Goodnight </I>
