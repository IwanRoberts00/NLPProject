Dear Pam ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#3:1>
Hiya !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#4:1>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#5:1>
I have received your letter and photos for a long time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#6:1>
I am sorry so late to reply your letter as I <del> have </del> been
very busy during last three weeks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#7:1>
By the way , I have done all of my bloody assignments before the
deadlines .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#8:1>
Start from tomorrow , I have to work at a Chinese Take-away which I
have worked there before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#9:1>
The guy who normally works there asked for 2 weeks off because his
wife <del> will </del> is going to give birth to a baby soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#10:1>
So he needs that 2 weeks off to accompany his wife .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#11:1>
What  ' s a wonderful husband !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#12:1>
Then I am going to work on tomorrow Friday and Saturday and 5 days on
next week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#13:1>
I am looking forward earning some extra money for Christmas spending
, right ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#14:1>
I have 3 week  ' s holiday from 19th Dec .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#15:1>
I work on the first week , then I will spend my 2nd week with Chu
&obrack; he got 10 day  ' s off at Christmas &cbrack; and the final week , I
will go <-> bach </-> <+> back </+> to Hall to get my assignments done .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#16:1>
I have 6 assignments so far for the 2nd term . which I have to give
in 3 of them during the week after holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#17:1>
I can't believe it is my 2nd year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#18:1>
Hope God bless and help me &obrack; just joking ! ! &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#19:1>
The Hall is extremely quiet .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#20:1>
Most of students have gone back to their home countries or home
counties , may be some of them went for travelling .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#21:1>
Just take this block for example , they should be 18 students in this
block normally , but it <del> ve </del> has 3 students left &obrack; included
me &cbrack; , none in the ground floor , 2 in the first floor and 1 &obrack;
it  ' s me &cbrack; in the 2nd floor .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#22:1>
I am bored now but I can't go anywhere .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#23:1>
Normally , we always have a chat in the kitchen but now I occupied
the whole kitchen . <del> one-character </del>

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#24:1>
I think it is too <del> two- characters </del> large for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#25:1>
I miss all my friends in Hong Kong.

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#26:1>
Be honest

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#27:1>
I don't like my Chinese friends who I met in England , they always
have 2 sides of character so I have to watch what I say . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#28:1>
Well !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#29:1>
have you got any presents from my sister yet ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#30:1>
If not , could you give her a ring ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#31:1>
The mini organiser you wanted have been sold out last year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#32:1>
I have asked the shopkeeper about it , they said they wouldn't have
anymore , anyhow , hope you like this small diary and the forever friend
chocolate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#33:1>
Oh yeah !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#34:1>
One thing I forgot to tell you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#35:1>
Our Chinese Society held a Christmas disco on last Sunday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#36:1>
It  ' s marvellous !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#37:1>
Firstly , I won a prize .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#38:1>
Secondly , I knew a guy who fancy me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#39:1>
He is a local Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#40:1>
he looks alright but he is not my type .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#41:1>
I danced with him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#42:1>
He is so talkative and I think his <del> one-character </del>
personality is good &obrack :

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#43:1>
he can't speak Chinese &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#44:1>
So we communicated with English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#45:1>
A friend of mine , Sandy , she fancy him very much so I introduced
her to him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#46:1>
&obrack : Oh ! I forget to tell you his name , &ldquo; Dani &rdquo;
&cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#47:1>
Afterwards , I asked Dani that what did <del> three-characters </del>
he think about Sandy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#48:1>
Don't you know how did he reply me , he said &ldquo; She is nice and
pretty but she dances with too many other guys . &rqduo;

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#49:1>
At that moment , I said nothing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#50:1>
I don't think Sandy <del> e </del> has any chance as well as Dani
don't have any chance me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#51:1>
Never mind , it  ' s just a little gossip . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#52:1>
I have talked too much about myself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#53:1>
How will you spend your Christmas ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#54:1>
Is &ldquo; Faye Wong &rdquo; concert nice ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#55:1>
Are you going to see Christmas <-> decroration </-> <+> decoration
</+> at Tsim Sha Tsui ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#56:1>
How  ' s your course going on ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#57:1>
Have you found any jobs ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#58:1>
Paul Tsang has rang me a long time ago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#59:1>
He got a job at <del> Sh </del> South China Morning Post .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#60:1>
It sounds good , isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#61:1>
But he Said it  ' s really low paid during the probation as he do not
have any work experience at <del> two-characters </del> all .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#62:1>
I can't <del> think </del> image how much <del> I would have </del> I
will earn when I graduate .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#63:1>
Lastly , Thank you very much for your Christmas presents , they are
gorgeous !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#64:1>
I like them very much .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#257:5>
You can never imagine how happy I am to receive your surprises
for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#258:5>
I can't stop laughing to myself and I wonder how this joy may last .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#259:5>
And for your second surprise &obrack; you coming to HK &cbrack; , I
can never imagine that my dream will COME TRUE so SOON !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#260:5>
Thanks GOD ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#261:5>
Now that we can communicate with e-mail , could we communicate
more often ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#262:5>
I hope that you can continue keeping in touch with me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#263:5>
Also I know that we can do the direct communication as well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#264:5>
It doesn't matter the day and night difference between Canada and HK
, as long as you can make it , I can make it too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#265:5>
I can stay at school overnight for a night once or twice a month ,
or maybe a week , it doesn't matter since I can live in the hostel of my
friends .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#266:5>
Then I can stay up at night to talk to you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#267:5>
However , I must check how to start the communication and also we
must make very ACCURATE appointment since I am always very confused in time
lags . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#268:5>
I hope that you can find reading from computers easier soon
since I tend to send very long e-mails .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#269:5>
I don't know why I always have so many things which I want to talk
about .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#270:5>
Maybe it  ' s because I am too excited . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-010#271:5>
And about your trip to HK , is there anything that we can
prepare for you , your mother and grandmother ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#272:5>
Since we  ' ve got e-mail , messages can be communicated so easily ,
THANKS the inventor of e-mail !

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#273:5>
So if you  ' ve got any inquiries or anything in need , do tell me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#274:5>
Also I must tell Mom and uncle and grandmother about this piece of
good news ASAP ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#275:5>

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#277:5>

I can inform her in detail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#279:5>
Let me now design a plan for your trip .

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#280:5>

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#282:5>
Wow , isn't it wonderful ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-010#283:5>
Actually I  ' ve got a lot more to say .
