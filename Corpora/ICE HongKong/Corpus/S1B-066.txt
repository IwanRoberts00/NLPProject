<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X9:1:Z>
Yes worried </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#10:1:A>
Why were you worried <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X11:1:Z>
Uh because I guessed that <,> it might be the lady complainant <,>
whom I had just <,> had the struggle with <,> uh that had picked it up </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#12:1:A>
Why were you concerned <,> that your pager <,> might have been
picked up by the lady complainant <O> Cantonese word </O> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X13:1:Z>
Clear that uh <,> yes uh she might uh yes after picking up this
pager will go to the police station <,> sorry to accuse me that is to frame
me <,> with the allegation that I had <,> I had tried to yes rape her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#14:1:A>
Now Mr Au Yeung tell me this why did you worry about an
attempted rape an allegation of attempted rape <&> Recording fast-forwards
</&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X15:1:Z>
Because I really have had the sex transaction with her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#16:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#17:1:A>
But uh that transaction with Madam Ho if I understand you correctly
was entirely with her consent <O> Cantonese answer </O> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X18:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#19:1:A>
And according to you it was Madam Ho who suggested to you to
have sex with her in return for <.> f </.> for five hundred dollars is that
right <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X20:1:Z>
Yes that  ' s right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#21:1:A>
Well that being the case why did you think that she might
frame you or she might report you <.> f </.> for attempted attempting to rape
her I <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X22:1:Z>
At that time her <{> <[> uh </[> yes uh causing her injury uh and
I had pushed her out of the taxi uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#23:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> <O> Cantonese question </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X24:1:Z>
And I also forgot to pay her the money </X> <O> Cantonese answer
</O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X25:1:Z>
So if she was the person who really had picked up my pager uh then
I feared that he would go to uh report <,> uh accusing me yes of raping her
uh and that  ' s why I was frightened </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#26:1:A>
But according to you <,> Madam Ho assaulted you first <O>
Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X27:1:Z>
Yes he she was the one she was the one who who uh set her hands on
me uh to assaulted me first but then uh uh in return I had assaulted her <,>
causing her <.> in </.> causing her injury and then I <,> I pushed her out of
the taxi <,> and I drove away myself

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X28:1:Z>
So <,> so if she really had picked up my pager then she must be
very crossed with me and then she would revenge <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X29:1:Z>
I making the report to the police uh uh that I had raped her

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X30:1:Z>
And that  ' s why <,> I feared that some thing some thing of bad
nature will happen and so I had to <,> uh go to the police station and <,>
made a report <,> made a report in advance first </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#31:1:A>
When you made a report to the police did you complain of the
assault by Madam Ho or did you complain of the lost of your pager <O>
Cantonese words </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X32:1:Z>
I <unc> one word </unc> uh in saying that I had had <,> a
struggle with a female passenger </X> <O> Cantonese question and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X33:1:Z>
And I suspect <,> I suspect that it was during the time <,> when I
was struggling with her then <,> uh then I lost my pager </X> <O> Cantonese
answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X34:1:Z>
Well and I also told the police that uh since I had assaulted her
<,> yes and made made her injured so I feared that <,> she might have picked
up <,> my pager and then she would go to a police station <,> to report
against me uh accusing me of <,> of raping her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#35:1:A>
Oh I see

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#36:1:A>
Now tell me this Mr Au Yeung <,> if you had not lost your pager
would you have gone to the police <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X37:1:Z>
Then for the time being I would not have this intention </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#38:1:A>
Now Mr Au Yeung is it the truth of the matter is <,> because
you had attempted <,> to rape Madam Ho <,> and because you had you feared
that she might have got hold of your pager that you went to the police first
in order to get in first

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X39:1:Z>
Yes uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#40:1:A>
And you realised Mr Au Yeung that one if Madam Ho had got your
pager this would lead to the disclosure or discover of your identity is that
right <O> Cantonese word </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X41:1:Z>
Yes I realised that yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#42:1:A>
And were you afraid that your identity might be discovered

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X43:1:Z>
Well I uhm I knew that if <,> if she really took my pager to the
police station to make a report uh then certainly <,> yes my identity will be
found out </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#44:1:A>
And my question is Mr Au Yeung were you afraid <,> that your
identity might be discovered <O>'that your identity ' overlap  ' nàh gouh mahn
tàih haih ' -'the problem is  '  </O> <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>
<&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X45:1:Z>
But if I did not <,> yes make a report in advance uh then <,> uh
then suppose she she became the first one who went to the police station to
make a report then <,> then it will be very difficult for me <,> to put up an
explanation that will be believed <,> by the police </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#46:1:A>
Now Mr Au Yeung you still have not answered my question

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#47:1:A>
My question is were you afraid that your identity might be
discovered <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>
<O> Cantonese question </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X48:1:Z>
Well I have already answered that is as I told the court uh since
I had <,> yes I registered with my true address true address uh <,> yes in
the purchase of this pager so certainly if <,> if she had picked up the pager
and <,> yes and she went to the police station then then uh well then my
identity my identity will certainly be traced and found </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X49:1:Z>
Mr uh are you <unc> two words </unc> you are being asked
whether or not you were frightened that your identity would be <unc> a
few words </unc> question I think you can answer yes or no </X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X50:1:Z>
Yes </X> <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X51:1:Z>
Well as far as my feeling is concerned uh yes there  ' s nothing to
do with whether I was afraid or not but but my idea is that I should go to
the police station to make a report in advance </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#52:1:A>
All right Mr Au Yeung I  ' m not going to <,> sort of waste
further time on this point if you don't want to answer

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#53:1:A>
Now let me ask you this

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#54:1:A>
Did you think that <,> by going to the police first <,> you are in
a more advantageous position

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X55:1:Z>
Uh would not occurred to me to think about it this way </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#56:1:A>
Yes but a moment ago I thought you told My Lord and the jury
that uh if you were to go to the police first uh if you were to go to the
police later meaning my understanding is later than Madam Ho <,> you would
find it more difficult to explain yourself or worse will that in fact <O>
Cantonese word </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#57:1:A>
It would <&> Recording fast-forwards </&> <O> Cantonese word
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#58:1:A>
Is that not an advantage for reporting the matter first <O>
Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X59:1:Z>
It  ' s not a not a not a question uh concerning advantages or not
but but as far as I was concerned I thought that I should I should go to the
police to make a report </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#60:1:A>
Now let me ask you just once more

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#61:1:A>
Did you think that you were in a more advantageous position by
reporting to the police first <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X62:1:Z>
What about uh yes uh which between us which between us would
report first to the police but anyway my idea was that I should go to the
police and made a report in advance </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#63:1:A>
All right let me move on to another subject <O> Cantonese
translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#64:1:A>
My Lord I  ' ll be moving on to another

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#65:1:A>
Would Your Lordship like to move on

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#66:1:A>

<[> Yes </[> </{> all right <unc> a few words </unc> </X>
<&> Recording restarts </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#68:1:A>
<&> Part of the recording missing </&> Did it take you to
drive from the spot where <,> Madam Ho boarded the taxi until the point when
you reached the Hong Shing Garden <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X69:1:Z>
Uh about ten minutes drive </X> <O> Unidentified speech </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#70:1:A>
And you say during those ten minutes you had this detailed
conversation with Madam Ho is that right

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X71:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#72:1:A>
And can you confirm that you had told My Lord and the jury
each and everything about the conversation you had with Madam Ho <O>
Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X73:1:Z>
Well yes nearly nearly I told the court everything </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#74:1:A>
Yes uhm and is there anything further you would like to
supplement <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X75:1:Z>
Well nothing for the time being </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#76:1:A>
During the journey when you first had a conversation with
Madam Ho did you ask her <,> the name of the karaoke lounge she was working
in O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X77:1:Z>
No I did not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#78:1:A>
Why not <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X79:1:Z>
Well well because I reflected that what I was talking to her
during this conversation <,> was was nearly words

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X80:1:Z>
That means we  ' re we  ' re just purely talking to each other </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#81:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#82:1:A>
Are you saying that uh whatever you told Madam Ho you didn't mean
it at all <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X83:1:Z>
Well what I mean is that uh we were only having some casual chat
uh that means even if <,> after I heard <,> heard about it that that doesn't
necessarily mean that I had to visit that place </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#84:1:A>
And of course you have told us that she has asked you to
patronise her is that right <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X85:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#86:1:A>
Did you tell her that you would do so in your spare time <&>
Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X87:1:Z>
Well I think is that okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#88:1:A>
And did you follow that up by asking her <,> where was your
<.> r </.> karaoke lounge <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#89:1:A>
And its name <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X90:1:Z>
In about </X> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X91:1:Z>
In fact at the early beginning I had already asked that and she
had told me that <,> it was at Wanchai </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#92:1:A>
But Mr Au Yeung we must realise that in Wanchai is big area
<O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#93:1:A>
And there <{> <[> are many many </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X94:1:Z>
<[> Yes I had </[> </{> sorry sorry </X> <O> Cantonese translation
and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X95:1:Z>
Well </X> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X96:1:Z>
Yes but I did not really intended that I will certainly visit that
place </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#97:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X98:1:Z>
And that  ' s why sorry <,> and that  ' s why it did not occur to me
to asking her for that particulars </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#99:1:A>
Anyway as what you knew about her was that she was working in
a karaoke lounge somewhere in Wanchai <O> Cantonese word </O> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X100:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#101:1:A>
And that is all you knew about her <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&> <O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X102:1:Z>
Uh well I knew that she was working in a karaoke lounge </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#103:1:A>
And that was all you knew about her <O> A Cantonese word </O>
<&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X104:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#105:1:A>
Did you ask her in what capacity she was employed in this
karaoke <O> A few Cantonese words </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X106:1:Z>
Uh I did not ask her in such a great detail </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#107:1:A>
Well what you mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#108:1:A>
The question is a simple one

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#109:1:A>
Did you or did you not ask her in what capacity she was employed
in the karaoke <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#110:1:A>
And in your mind what did you think she was <O> Cantonese
translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X111:1:Z>
I did not pay much attention to <,> what sort of occupation she
had </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#112:1:A>
No my question is Mr Au Yeung what did you yourself think she
was employed as in this karaoke

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X113:1:Z>
Yes in my mind yes I did not think this way that is <,> I was
only chatting casually with her so <,> so I did not feel that uh nothing need
as necessary for me to <,> to question her in such great details </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#114:1:A>
It did occur to you that she was <,> a PR <,> in the karaoke
<&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X115:1:Z>
Yes uh this idea uh also came to my minds </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#116:1:A>
So in other words you thought that she was a PR girl in the
karaoke is that right <O> Cantonese word </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards
</&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X117:1:Z>
Perhaps so </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#118:1:A>
What you mean perhaps so <O> Cantonese translation and answer
</O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X119:1:Z>
Well that is <,> uh yes after I had <.> h </.> I had heard her
saying these kind of things uh then <,> then I also had this kind of idea
that perhaps she was </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#120:1:A>
When did it occur to you that she was a PR girl in the
karaoke <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

Financially <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O> <&>

What do you mean by that <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&>
Recording fast-forwards </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X126:1:Z>
By the time when she uh put those questions to me then uh when
she eventually asked me to help her uh then <,> then I realised that she had
this sort of idea </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#127:1:A>
Did Madam Ho ever tell you that she was prepared to have sex
with you <,> if you pay her five hundred dollars <O> Cantonese translation
</O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

you do <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X138:1:Z>
Then I promised her <,> uh yes I said that I would <,> pay her

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#139:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#144:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#146:1:A>
And uh did you find her attractive <O> Cantonese translation
and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X147:1:Z>
I could not her see her very clearly because at that time <,> it
was very dark inside the compartment of the taxi </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#148:1:A>
For example because it was dark you couldn't see her face
clearly right <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards <&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X149:1:Z>
Not very clearly that  ' s right </X>

You could not even for example see clearly what her figure
was <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

That  ' s right uh as for her <.> bo </.> body built not very

And for that matter you did not even have any idea as to how
old she was <&> Recording fast-forwards <&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X153:1:Z>
Well but I estimated that uh <,> yes she must be uh uh in in her
thirties around thirty years old </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#154:1:A>
And yet at a suggestion of someone a woman who <.> f </.>
whose face you have not clearly seen <,> and whose figure you had no idea
whatsoever <,> and a woman whom you thought to a PR girl in a karaoke <,> at
her suggestion of sex and all of a sudden you had this sexual urge is that
what you are telling us <&> Recording fast-forwards <&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X233:1:Z>

I would presume that uh yes there would be enough money to pay her yes if I
were willing to pay her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#234:1:A>
And of course you knew according to you that Madam Ho was
furious

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#235:1:A>
She was angry because you didn't pay her <{> <[> right </[>

<$Z1> <X>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X237:1:Z>
But at time I was actually bargaining with her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#238:1:A>
Yes

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X239:1:Z>
I said that since <,> since I could not do that successfully so
uh would you mind to have a lesser sum so it was in fact did so it was in
fact we were negotiating uh to a bargaining </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#240:1:A>
But if I understand your evidence correctly the bargaining or
the bargain fell through <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#241:1:A>
Madam Ho insisted on having five hundred dollars from you <&>
Recording fast forwards </&> <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X242:1:Z>
Well but before she really assaulted me uh then I thought that
perhaps we could still go on to negotiate it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#243:1:A>
All right let me ask the question in another way

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#244:1:A>
On that eventful night <,> did you or did not use or did you not
think that Madam Ho was <.> wil </.> was <,> willing to accept three hundred
dollars from you <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X245:1:Z>
But <.> be </.> but at that stage she had not yet uh mentioned
whether she was or she was not to accept the lesser sum uh and she uh she had
not told me </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#246:1:A>
Did she later on <,> mention that she was not willing to
accept the lesser sum <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X247:1:Z>
She did not say those words

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X248:1:Z>
She just said so now are you going to pay me or not </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#249:1:A>
And what did you understand that to mean <O> Cantonese
translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&> <O> Cantonese translation
</O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X250:1:Z>
That means she wanted uh to have me pay her the exact sum of five
hundred dollars </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#251:1:A>
So in other words she refused to accept <O> Cantonese
translation </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#252:1:A>
Less than five five hundred dollars is that right <O>  ' Less'
overlaps  ' gám wuhn geui syut wah ' -  ' so that is to say',  ' is that right'
overlap  ' nàh wuhn geui syut wah ' -  ' so that is to say </O> <O> Cantonese

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X253:1:Z>
I don't know whether she was willing to accept that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#254:1:A>
You mean to say after all this that had happened you still
harboured that thought that she was willing to accept three hundred dollars
from you <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X255:1:Z>
Well because at that stage I personally was also considering too
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#256:1:A>
What were you considering Mr Au Yeung <O>  ' Au Yeung ' overlap  ' háau
lèuih -'think about ' </O> <O> Cantonese translation and answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X257:1:Z>
Well I was considering whether I should pay her the full amount
of yes of the money </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#258:1:A>
Did you occur <O>  ' occur ' overlaps unclear Cantonese

trouble to pay her five hundred dollars <O> Cantonese translation and answer
</O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X259:1:Z>
Well <.> bef </.> uhm well before I <,> uh before I could set my
mind uh to think about it this way then she already start she already started
to assault me

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X260:1:Z>
So I was <,> I was <,> nearly thinking for it for a short while
then she started </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#261:1:A>
Now let me ask you the question once more Mr Au Yeung

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#262:1:A>
Did it occur to you to pay her five hundred dollars in order to
avoid any trouble <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards
</O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X263:1:Z>
Well indeed that was what I what I was thinking

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X264:1:Z>
I was considering whether I should pay her the full amount </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#265:1:A>
And because of the action which Madam Ho subsequently took
namely assaulting you <,> you changed your mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#266:1:A>
Is that what you are telling us <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>
<O> Cantonese answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X267:1:Z>
But at that time it did not occur to me to think about it in this
uh think about it uh at these circumstances </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#268:1:A>
All right

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#269:1:A>

Did it occur to you to pay her five hundred dollars instead
of returning the gross <O> Cantonese translation </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X273:1:Z>
No because at that stage she just assaulted me out of no reason
so I became very angry </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#274:1:A>
Uh take it that you knew she was a woman <O> Cantonese

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#360:1:A>
And then you said you fell <,,> you fell that when you <.> f
</.> finished the struggle you fear that something might happen <O> Cantonese
translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#361:1:A>
Yes My Lord uh of course I I  ' m bound by Your Lordship  ' s
record so perhaps Your Lordship would be good enough to read out what Your

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X366:1:Z>
Well that is after I has just yes finished having the fight with
her uh then I fear that uh if the police vehicle just happened to drive
passed there then perhaps she would report to the police that I had assaulted
her so uh so that was the nature of the things that I would that I fear </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#367:1:A>
But Mr Au Yeung it was she who assaulted you first so why
were you afraid you haven't done anything wrong <O>  ' haven't ' overlaps  ' nàh'
</O> <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X368:1:Z>
Even even though it was she who assaulted me first but uhm when
it came to the time that she reported the case to police then it will be
perfectly all right for her to say anything else for example she would say
that I was the one who assaulted first or even I had raped her

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X369:1:Z>
It  ' s up to up to her to say anything she liked </X>

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X370:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#371:1:A>
Now Mr Au Yeung does that mean that uhm the question of uh
attempted rape was worrying you bothering you at that time <O>  ' at ' overlaps  ' nàh'
</O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X372:1:Z>
The time just because I was frightened and that  ' s why I left the
scene immediately </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#373:1:A>
Frightened of being discovered that you had attempted to rape
Madam Ho <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#374:1:A>

answer </O>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X375:1:Z>
I did not know what she was going to say so <,> so at least I
fear that she might accuse me of assaulting her </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#376:1:A>
Now on that night you carried your knife exhibit D eight with
you did you not <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording fast-forwards

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#381:1:A>

in case you are being robbed <O> Cantonese translation </O> <&> Recording
fast-forwards </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-066#383:1:A>
You did not make the knife handy ready to be used by you

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-066#X384:1:Z>
