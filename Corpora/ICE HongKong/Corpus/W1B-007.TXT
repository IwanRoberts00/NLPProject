Hi , Chan Wing Kai &ampersand; &ldquo; Naked fish &rdquo; ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#2:1>
How are you two ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#3:1>
I  ' m really wondering about a e-mail address is using by two persons !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#4:1>
Actually , who is the host of this address ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#5:1>
It seems nonsense for me to have a name &ldquo; lcheung &rdquo;
but it is also <-> ridiculour </-> <+> ridiculous </+> for you to get a no.
9214420 as your &ldquo; trademark &rdquo; !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#6:1>
Anyway , &ldquo; <indig> fight wa </indig> &ldquo; I have not much
time to say , but I really thank you for sending e-mail to me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#7:1>
The life here is simple .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#8:1>
I take 18 credits this quarter and get 2 on-campus job , working 16.5
hour/week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#9:1>
How about you &obrack; two &cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#10:1>
I want to have your e-mail address <-> indivalually </-> <+>
individually </+> , and those address of O QC boys as well , would you please
give some of those to me ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#11:1>
Tell me something about QUEEN  ' s ROSE ASSOCIATION !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#12:1>
Yip Tin Chi told me that Ho Man Wing has got a girlfriend , do you
<-> knowthat </-> <+> know that </+> is &ldquo; hard &rdquo; or &ldquo;
flowing &rdquo; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#13:1>
Tell me or tell Ho Man Wing send a mail to me so that I can ask hom
directly ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#14:1>
Send mail to me as often as you like , I am used to check my
mail-box twice a day , and i would probably reply immediately as I receive
any mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#15:1>
Or we may &ldquo; talk &rdquo; thro ' the computer , but I still don't
know how to do so ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#16:1>
please ask someone to learn how it cooperates and I will &ldquo; date
&rdquo; you at some time later to &ldquo; talk &rdquo; to you thro ' the
computer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#17:1>
Yesterday Sucker &obrack; Lau Kin Cheong &cbrack; sent me a mail and
I have told him a lot of things here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#18:1>
I think I will not repeat them now , but I have told sucker to send
the mail to other QC boys &obrack; including Chan Wing Kai &cbrack; if he can
do so .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#19:1>
Ask sucker if you don't get it . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#20:1>
I have to go for work now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#21:1>
See you !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#22:1>
&obrack; Chak Lam , Chak Lam , don't say that you are my &ldquo;
<indig> Tight Sun </indig> &ldquo; , Dennis Yeung Ka Kai is the only one who
gets the qualification to be this position ! &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#23:1>
Until Next Time ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#24:1>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#26:2>
Hey ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#27:2>
I am now 12:00am and I have just spent so much time on how to
talk to those in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#28:2>
Unfortunately , I fail to do so as &ldquo; talk h92144??@hkuxa.hku.hk
&rdquo; is always &ldquo; rejected &rdquo; by the computer or ...... &obrack;
difficult to explain ! &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#29:2>
Can you &ldquo; call &rdquo; me tomorrow &obrack; that  ' s meant <->
yo </-> <+> you </+> type &ldquo; talk &rdquo; on youur computer &cbrack; at
about 1:30pm &obrack; HK Time &cbrack; , at that time I will probably be
logged on &obrack; from 1pm-2pm is okay , I think &cbrack; , so , I am
waiting to talk to you tomrromow !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#30:2>
&obrack; If you read this mail after 2pm 9 OCT , try to contact me ,
too if it does not work , try again on everyday 1pm-2pm ! &cbrack; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#31:2>
I will tell you things in Seattle as I  ' ve promised !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#32:2>
Sooner or Later ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#33:2>
Michael </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#34:3>
Hey , Sucker ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#35:3>
I check my E-mail every day after I send E-mail to you ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#36:3>
you eventually reply , oh god , I  ' m really happy .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#37:3>
You still concern the locker ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#38:3>
Ah , I think all the stuff inside have been removed to the assistant
principal !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#39:3>
I gave your key to Yip Hey Yin &obrack; the fat guy staying in study
room every Friday &cbrack; on 4 Sep 92 &obrack; Fri &cbrack; and told him to
give the key to you when you come back on Monday morning &obrack; the
deadline of the <-> clearence </-> <+> clearance </+> of lockers &cbrack;
&obrack;  ' cos I needed to go to Guangzhou on Friday ! &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#40:3>
Oh , that stupid &ldquo; ML &rdquo; , told me on Tuesday that your
locker has been broken but he still took no action about that !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#41:3>
You may say a &ldquo; Ting &rdquo; now , I know , but this is not my
fault ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#42:3>
go straight to that stupid &ldquo; ML &rdquo; and punch him !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#43:3>
&obrack; I remember that the report sheet of Yu Tak Ming was inside
the locker , so no need to worry ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#44:3>
I think if those &ldquo; smart &rdquo; assistant principal found that
, they would probably keep that for Yu Tak Ming &obrack; but not for you !
&cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#45:3>
Life in here is easy , too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#46:3>
I take some Math courses and Engineering courses and some social
science courses in this Quarter ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#47:3>
that  ' s worth a max . of 18 credits I can take for each quarter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#48:3>
However , to loiter those &ldquo; <indig> <-> Moo New </-> <+> Mou
Liu </+> </indig> &ldquo;  ' s time , I find 2 on-campus job working 16.5
hr/week , in a cafe as Grill and in a library as a librarian ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#49:3>
that  ' s interesting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#50:3>
Seattle is beautiful , especially the university

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#51:3>
&obrack; maybe I  ' ve seen so little attractive scene ! &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#52:3>
But those guys here are not as easy as I think .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#53:3>
Last Friday , the fire alarm rang 3 times &obrack; 12 midnight , 2am
& 3am ! &cbrack; and each time I  ' ve just fallen into sleep ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#54:3>
I needed to be hurry and ran down the stair !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#55:3>
&obrack; It was so cold outside as I  ' ve only dressed very few !
&cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#56:3>
<-> Unfortunely </-> <+> Unfortunately </+> , the story has <-> bot
</-> <+> not </+> already subjected to end .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#57:3>
A few hours earlier , another fire started in our dorm !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#58:3>
It was &ldquo; <-> bette </-> <+> better </+> &ldquo;  ' cos it was 7pm
only .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#59:3>
I really want to know how to escape from this annoying fire . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#60:3>
Class has only began for 1 week , and I hope I can manage both
the homework and my job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#61:3>
Some of the classrooms are as big as a &ldquo; stadium &rdquo; for
those 100-level course , and those courses with 200-level or above are much
better .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#62:3>
I am taking a computer <-> programing </-> <+> programming </+>
course now ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#63:3>
the language learned is &ldquo; Ada &rdquo; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#64:3>
do you know about it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#65:3>
If so , that  ' s good ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#66:3>
I can ask you something about that . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#67:3>
Thanks a lot for remembering my modem ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#68:3>
I think that  ' s fine .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#69:3>
I  ' m planning to buy a FAX machine here as it is much easy to
communicate with those in Hong Kong &obrack; especially my family &cbrack;
and it is as cheap as physical mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#70:3>
I will tell you my FAX no. if I get it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#71:3>
I think it is too long for a E-mail .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#72:3>
Can you transfer this message to the E-mail of Yu Tak Ming , Bunsun ,
Harrace , Ho Ming Wing , Chan Wing Kai , Yip Tin Chi and so on

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#73:3>
&obrack; the list is too long ! &cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#74:3>
If so , please do so , since I think I can't mail to each of them
individually ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#75:3>
thanks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#76:3>
And for those who receive this message , please send mail to me to
just say a &ldquo; Hello &rdquo; if you have time ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#77:3>
Hope you can eventually transfer to the Department of Psychology !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#78:3>
&obrack; But I don't know how many years later it works !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#79:3>
Ah ! &cbrack; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#80:3>
Best Wishes

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#81:3>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#82:4>
Hi , Kai Kai ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#83:4>
Your wonder me why I know you are Kai Kai ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#84:4>
it  ' s simply because you type this name in the computer record and I
fingered it out !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#85:4>
Ah Ah ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#86:4>
You said that you work too much and hinder your normal study ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#87:4>
hey , so why don't you give up some of that ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#88:4>
To be financial independent is not a thing that can be done in a
short time !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#89:4>
You know , the MOST important thing to you &obrack; as well as me
&cbrack; now is studying !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#90:4>
It is an another <-> begining </-> <+> beginning </+> when we go to
the university , no one bother what you grades are when you are in secondary
school as long as you study well in U .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#91:4>
I have the experience that activities made myself really tired and
exhausted to study !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#92:4>
You know , that  ' s what I was in F.6 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#93:4>
Gain others  '  experience and not to repeat their faults . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#94:4>
My job as a grill is quite easy , and I think because of I am
&ldquo; Pa &rdquo; &obrack; afraid of &cbrack; die , so I will never try
something that may make myself hurt !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#95:4>
These <-> twe </-> <+> <?> two </?> </+> weeks my tasks are only
grill the hamburger and hot dog , make them prepared for sell and wash the
pan ......

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#96:4>
I hope I will not burn my finger twice a day !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#97:4>
Otherwise , I will punch you when I back Hong Kong ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#98:4>
It seems quite challenging that you take a job concerning the
meeting of Legislative Council .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#99:4>
How can you get the job ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#100:4>
I was previously a young reporter of the RTHK &obrack; <-> Radil
</-> <+> Radio </+> 3 : English Channel &cbrack; , but I think my job is
totally different from yours . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#101:4>
You will be a dancer ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#102:4>
I wonder !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#103:4>
You will be the section of the boys take part or those for the girls ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#104:4>
Ah Ah !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#105:4>
Don't be angry ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#106:4>
just a joke !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#107:4>
But your performance is opened to public or just for those in HKU ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#108:4>
If it is for the public , I suggest you urge those in our Queen  ' s
Rose Association to see you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#109:4>
&obrack; Just as last year many of those girls went to City Hall to
see the performance of Lam Cheung Kwan. &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#110:4>
I am not so bad as you are ,  ' cos the course here is easy and I
think I can manage , even there are always quiz or midterms , those marks are
to be counted towards the final grade .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#111:4>
I decide to finish my undergraduate study in 3 years , and I hope I
can double major in <-> Mechnical </-> <+> Mechanical </+> Engineering and
Mathematics ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#112:4>
if not , I will probably drop one of them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#113:4>
Do you think those of the QDA will celebrate your birthday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#114:4>
I hope so , and I can &ldquo; informally &rdquo; tell this to Gorly
, let see what they will do &obrack; or they will not do . &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#115:4>
How about Biby &obrack; your elder sister &cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#116:4>
Please say a &ldquo; Hi &rdquo; to her for me ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#117:4>
thanks ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#118:4>
Whom do you always keep contact with

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#119:4>
&obrack; I  ' m talking about OQC &cbrack; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#120:4>
Do you always meet Ho Man Wing , Bunsun , Sucker , Shu Yan and so on ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#121:4>
I wonder Bunsun has a <-> computert </-> <+> computer </+> account
or not because I cannot find him when I finger those accounts belong to QC
boys .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#122:4>
Tell Chow Kwok Lun to &ldquo; login &rdquo; his accounts  ' cos I
found him never <-> loggin </-> <+> log in </+> !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#123:4>
And also Ho Man Wing , I have sent a message to him last night
&obrack; accompanied with that sent to yours &cbrack; , remark him to read ,
please .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#124:4>
How about Wong Chak Lam ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#125:4>
Is he busy with his &ldquo; basic law &rdquo; ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#126:4>
It seems it takes a long time for those not in the engineering
department to open an account in HKU ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#127:4>
Hey , if you have time , always remember that you can send mail
to me and I will not make you disappointed as I <-> wll </-> <+> will </+>
reply at once ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#128:4>
Keep in touch

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#129:4>
Michael

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#130:4>
Take Care !

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#131:4>
&obrack; Ah , do you pay for the T-shirt of QRA? &cbrack; </I>

<I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#132:5>
Kai Kai ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#133:5>
I mail to you again because when I fingered you I discovered
that your last <-> loggin </-> <+> log in </+> time was on 8 Oct .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#134:5>
It is impossible for you to send a message to me yesterday if your
last <-> loggin </-> <+> log in </+> was a week before .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#135:5>
How come ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#136:5>
I read the letter of &ldquo; Lu Fung &rdquo; that he gave a
different email account no. to me , so , do you have two accounts , and
everyone in the engineering department has 2 accounts or even more ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#137:5>
Why can't I finger out the account of Bunsun ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#138:5>
I am rather perplexed now but this is only something minor ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#139:5>
if you have time , please reply me . </p> </I>

<I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#140:6>
Sorry <-> fo </-> <+> for </+> sending you some nonsense mails
because I have forgotten to make the &ldquo; backspace &rdquo; command work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#141:6>
I have just having my dinner and I would like to mail something to
you first before starting my work . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#142:6>
Recently , it seems like that a lot of things happened .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#143:6>
Some are good , some are bad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#144:6>
I don't know why I always have <-> somethings </-> <+> <?> something
</?> </+> to worry about and never settle down .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#145:6>
Anyway , I am happy to being with you and Shirley in those days .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#146:6>
Sometimes I think we are just a little bit crazy especially the
night but it was exciting and unforgettable .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#147:6>
I don't know if we can be close friends or not but one thing I am
sure is that I am happy to meet both of you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#148:6>
<-> I </-> <+> In </+> the first year of my U life , you two are the
only I can called friends in U .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#149:6>
So I will cherish your friendship .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#150:6>
Luckily , I have met some nice people in our group of O Project this
year and I hope we can keep in touch .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#151:6>
Through this project I have learnt a lot of things and I am happy to
work with Jacky because he is really a very good group leader and I
understand him more .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#152:6>
I think I gained more than I give out . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-007#153:6>
About our scandal , I hope it will fade out soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#154:6>
I don't if it will have any effect on our friendship but I hope it
will not .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#155:6>
I think it is better to stop here because I am <-> afrai </-> <+>
afraid </+> that there may be a ring .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#156:6>
See you later &dash; hopefully next week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#157:6>
Bye-bye ! ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-007#158:6>
Yours ,
