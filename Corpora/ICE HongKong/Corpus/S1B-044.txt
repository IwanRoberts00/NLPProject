Good evening and welcome to Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X2:1:Z>
In the last few days the government has been unveiling details of
its proposed Old Age Pension Scheme <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X3:1:Z>
Under the plan employers and employees will pay one and a half
percent each of the employee  ' s income <,> and everyone over the age of
sixty-five would get a pension of two thousand three hundred dollars a month
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X4:1:Z>
The government would make an initial contribution of ten billion
dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X5:1:Z>
Mr Patten has called the package a generous and prudent one <,> but
the main political parties have reservations and the expatriate community is
uneasy about paying into something from which it might not benefit <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X6:1:Z>
One Chinese language newspaper in addition has claimed that it will
mean a huge financial burden for the post nineteen ninety-seven SAR
Government <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X7:1:Z>
My co-host is Frank Ching and we  ' re joined in the studio by the
acting Secretary for Education and Manpower Lam Woon Kwong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X8:1:Z>
Hello Mr Lam

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X9:1:Z>
Uhm a huge financial burden for the SAR Government </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#10:1:A>
Not at all

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#11:1:A>
We are proposing a very prudent scheme at a very modest cost to the
community <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#12:1:A>
At one point five contribution one point five percent contribution
rate the uh cost is considered by many to be very modest <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#13:1:A>
At a benefit level of two thousand three hundred Hong Kong dollars
I think uh the public <.> al </.> also ought to agree that is a very basic
level of pension benefits <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#14:1:A>
Uh we are not suggesting uh any uh <,> huge uh burden to be borne
by the future SAR <unc> one-word </unc> Government

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#15:1:A>
We are suggesting a one-off capital injection of ten billion to
cover any unforeseen circumstances in the first few years of operation but
over time the scheme itself should generate some surplus <,> and that surplus
will provide a safety cushion and run the scheme itself so it it  ' s not a
scheme which will uh which should cause anybody any particular worries in the
future

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X16:1:Z>
But the number of old age pensioners in Hong Kong is expected to
rise dramatically over the next few decades isn't it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#17:1:A>
The number of aged people will increase obviously but uh we
are <,> we have a growth population

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#18:1:A>
Our working population is also projected to grow as well so that
will uh take off part of the impact and also part of the uh proposals in the
scheme is that we are indexing benefits to prices <,> whereas contributions
we are charging at uh one point five percent of the wage increase so the
differential uh between wage and price movement will also absorb part of the
impact and that is why overall taking these factors <.> toget </.> together
we are uh having a uh more prudent scheme than than many others elsewhere

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#19:1:B>
Mr Lam this is basically a welfare program

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#20:1:B>
Why are you disguising it and calling it a pension plan

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#21:1:A>
Well if you take the uh International Labour Organization  ' s
definition they would never admit that this is welfare

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#22:1:A>
I mean they would call it social security or social insurance and
this is probably the best description of the nature of the scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#23:1:A>
It is a self-help <,> scheme whereby <,> the active members of the
economy contribute to provide a degree of insurance for their future <,> uh
when they get old when they lose their earning power and that is what the
scheme is all about

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#24:1:B>
Well in a pension plan usually there is some correlation
between what you put in and what you take out eventually

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#25:1:B>
In in your uh plan a person who makes four thousand dollars a month
will put in a hundred dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#26:1:B>
Uh a person who makes uh forty thousand will put in a thousand
dollars a month and when those two people get to be sixty-five years old they  ' ll
both get the same amount <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#27:1:B>
Is that fair

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#28:1:A>
Well this scheme aims to provide a floor of income security
for our elderly people <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#29:1:A>
Uh it is very common elsewhere for uh nations to have two tiers of
uh retirement protection

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#30:1:A>
The first is the basic universal pension protection

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#31:1:A>
The second layer is much more earnings related i e uh you save uh
and and if you <,> earn more obviously you can save more and that is in
addition

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#32:1:A>
But we are suggesting that <,> since Hong Kong hasn't had this very
basic income protection we are suggesting that at a very modest cost <,>
should we also note at this stage of our affluence provide that basic floor
of income protection and that  ' s what the scheme is all about

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#33:1:A>
But at the same time we are promoting Voluntary Retirement Schemes

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#34:1:A>
We are encouraging companies to set up schemes for their own
employees so that they will have lump sum protection when they retire

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#35:1:A>
Take the lump sum retirement protection together with our basic
regular pension payments then we will have uh very comprehensive <.> hensive
</.> coverage for our elderly people

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#36:1:B>
Seems to me that what you are doing is really shifting the
responsibility of taking care of uh old age uh maybe indigent old age people
onto the uh shoulders of uh other people uh the working uh people of Hong
Kong <,> including uh foreign domestic helpers <,> uh who will not possibly
ever enjoy the benefit of uh retiring in Hong Kong

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#37:1:A>
This is a a a major misperception <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#38:1:A>
If you look at the figures <,> uh and look at them seriously <,>
government will on average over the next thirty years <,> be contributing at
least one third to the cost of the Old Age Pension Scheme <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#39:1:A>
We are going to play an active part in funding <{> <[> the scheme
but </[> </{> we are asking the employers and employees because they will
eventually benefit themselves to share the costs uh

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#40:1:B>
<[> Yeah you are talking </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#41:1:B>
Uh <.> t </.> tell me how how will that benefit eventually

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#42:1:B>
Uh I <.> let </.> I have a a foreign domestic uh helper at home uh
and I uh put in one and a half percent of her salary into this fund

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#43:1:B>
How would I benefit eventually

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#44:1:A>
Well when you reach sixty-five you will benefit when your
spouse reach sixty-five she will benefit and <{> <[> if you </[> have parents
now who are over sixty-five they will benefit

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#45:1:B>
<[> <unc> one word </unc> not </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#46:1:B>
But but not the person who is supposed to benefit the foreign
domestic helper <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#47:1:B>
She </[> would never benefit

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#48:1:A>
<[> The nature </[> </{> the nature of social insurance is
that it is a collective contribution and collective help self-help scheme <,>
so anyone who has played a part in it would have the opportunity to benefit

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#49:1:A>
I mean if your uh maid stay long enough uh when she reaches that
age she will also benefit

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#50:1:A>
But that is of course <{> <[> uh </[> you may argue that it  ' s
academic because you may not employ her when she is sixty-five

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#51:1:A>
<{> <[> But let  ' s look at the other side <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#52:1:A>
Okay </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#53:1:B>
<[> But </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#54:1:B>
<[> No no no it  ' s not it  ' s not that argument at all </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#55:1:B>
It  ' s the Hong Kong Government uh that will not allow her to stay
until <{> <[> she  ' s sixty-five </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#56:1:A>
<[> No no </[> </{> no no we never specify how how how old and
<{> <[> and </[> and they ought to be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X57:1:Z>
<[> Mr Lam </[> </{> I am sorry to interrupt but why are then are
you exempting those under the General Labour Importations Scheme <{> <[> and
</[> not the low <{> <[> paid </[> foreign workers for example </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#58:1:A>
<[> That that </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#59:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#60:1:A>
There is a fine difference between the two groups because under the
uh General Labour Importation Scheme we have been saying publicly <,> that we
would not normally renew the uh contracts of these imported workers after
they their third term which means that none of them can stay behind after six
years practically <,> but we have not set such as limit for foreign domestic
helpers and that  ' s why we are drawing this particular line

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#61:1:A>
But let me emphasize I mean this <,> <.> i </.> <,> in effect most
of the foreign domestic helpers will be exempted uh because of the uh uh
income floor that we are suggesting <,> and in effect <,> most of the
employers of these domestic helpers will only be contributing about fifty odd
dollars a month and which is <,> really a very very minor percentage of the
uh salary that the employer has to pay

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#62:1:A>
But as a matter of principle as a matter of principle we are saying
that anyone who is economically active in the community and getting wages and
income out of the community ought to also bear this obligation as a member of
the society

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X63:1:Z>
But wouldn't it be better for people to be able to walk out if
they don't think they are going to stay

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X64:1:Z>
I mean sometimes people are going to be paying double

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X65:1:Z>
They are going to be paying into an existing pension scheme and
another compulsory one and they may not <{> <[> be </[> staying anyway </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#66:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#67:1:A>
We have considered this option but uh the reality outside in the
private sector is that <,> most if not all of the private retirement schemes
they give lump sum <,> payments upon retirement or upon the departure of the
employees from these companies

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#68:1:A>
And given the rate of change of jobs of Hong Kong people in many
instances this lump sump doesn't mean a lot of things to the people who
retire

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#69:1:A>
And we are saying that even for those who have this benefit of lump
sum retirement schemes and bear in mind that  ' s only one third of the working
population <,> even for these with lump sum protection it is quite
complimentary to for them to also have a regular pension payment because
after all not all people would be able to manage their own lump sum
investment uh to keep <,> you know the rest of their retirement life to be to
have a adequate protection

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#70:1:A>
So <,> at one point five percent of contribution we do suggest that
it is a <.> worth </.> <.> in </.> worthwhile investment

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#71:1:B>
Mr Lam every once in a while I get the feeling that the
government  ' s left hand doesn't know what its right hand is doing <,> and in
this particular case I am getting that feeling again <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#72:1:B>
Uh going back to foreign domestic helpers <,> you know the Director
of Immigration will not allow them to stay until they are sixty-five

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#73:1:B>
In fact they have to leave within two weeks of the expiration of
their contract <,> so how how can you say that they have to pay but they
cannot possibly see any benefits uh when they retire

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#74:1:B>
Now <.> tha </.> that  ' s uh uh at one point

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#75:1:B>
And the second point <.> a </.> about the left hand not knowing
what the right hand is doing is uh the government previously has been
encouraging private companies to set up their own retirement schemes <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#76:1:B>
What you are proposing today is uh going to discourage companies
from setting up their private schemes

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#77:1:A>
Now Frank you  ' ve I think you  ' ve mixed up the information <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#78:1:A>
Foreign domestic helpers have to leave Hong Kong only if they have
not got their jobs and we have never said that <,> you know you must leave in
six years  '  time like what we have said to the <{> <[> imported labour </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#79:1:B>
<[> No you have to </[> </{> leave in two weeks  '  time

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#80:1:A>
No that  ' s only if they cannot get their contract renewed

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#81:1:B>
Yes <,> and then what about all all the money they have
already paid in

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#82:1:A>
Now this is a social insurance scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#83:1:A>
If you go to UK and work they may not allow you to stay on forever
but you  ' ve got to contribute because that is the obligation as an active uh
member of the economy and this principle applies to <,> many countries <{>
<[> uh as well <,> so we are </[> not exceptional

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#84:1:A>
We are not exceptional

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#85:1:B>
<[> So this is so this is really </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#86:1:B>
Uh this is really a tax that they have to pay

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#87:1:A>
It is a contribution in return for uh an eligibility if you
<,> are <,> still a member of the community by the time you are eligible and
I emphasize we are not exceptional in this particular respect

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#88:1:A>
Go and work elsewhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#89:1:A>
You  ' ve got to pay whatever they want you to pay in terms of social
security contributions

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X90:1:Z>
Uh Mr Lam this is expected to start in nineteen ninety-seven at
the earliest when uh Hong Kong moves into Chinese hands

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X91:1:Z>
What guarantees will young people who begin to pay into the
pension fund have that they will get the pension in say fifty years  '  time
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#92:1:A>
If the community endorses this proposal <,> then we will
proceed with implementing it

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#93:1:A>
We need the time to uh set up the legislative and executive
frameworks <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#94:1:A>
We estimate that it would need at least a couple of years to get
all those things ready but once it  ' s up there and running <,> uh there  ' s no
reason why it would not keep on running and uh I would suggest that uh this
would then form part of the Hong Kong community  ' s uhm social security scheme
and it would <,> be a long term scheme

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#95:1:A>
<{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X96:1:Z>
<[> China </[> </{> doesn't sound very encouraging <,> <{> <[>
exactly </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#97:1:A>
<[> Well </[> </{> we have yet to discuss with them uh over
the details

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#98:1:A>
We uh obviously would like to uh convince them that this is a good
scheme for the uh elderly people of Hong Kong and good for the uh uh harmony
of the society in the future <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#99:1:A>
Uh it  ' s too early days yet to say that they don't like it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X100:1:Z>
Emily Lau the independent legislator has said the government
hasn't got the will to push it through anyway so in fact it  ' s a waste of
time

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X101:1:Z>
The timetable  ' s too tight

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X102:1:Z>
What  ' s your response to that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#103:1:A>
If you <,> read back carefully <,,> <.> f </.> from the day
when I make my last statement in December last year to now it only took us
<,> slightly more than six months <,> and we  ' ve come out with a very
comprehensive set of proposal <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#104:1:A>
Now isn't that determination

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#105:1:A>
Isn't that efficiency

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#106:1:A>
<{> <[> Isn't that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#107:1:B>
<[> Why didn't </[> </{> you propose this ten years ago

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#108:1:B>
Why why wait until the eve of nineteen ninety-seven

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#109:1:A>
Frank I suppose you can say that to anything under the <{>
<[> sun but let  ' s look at let let  ' s </[> <,,> let  ' s look at the fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#110:1:A>
Twenty years ago ageing is not a <,> priority problem for the
community <,> but now <,> this problem has come up catch up with us like many
other societies

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#111:1:A>
We  ' ve got to face it

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#112:1:A>
If you don't face today you have to face tomorrow

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#113:1:A>
It  ' s as just a matter of fact

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-044#X114:1:Z>
<[> I  ' m afraid we  ' re running out of time Mr </[> </{> Lam so if
you can be brief </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-044#115:1:B>
Thank you Mr Lam </I>
