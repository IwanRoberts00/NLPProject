The heart of the global economy beat to the rhyme of the United
State

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#2:1:A>
The Asian Financial Crisis who have caused the world recession three
years ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#3:1:A>
If not for the robust American markets putting everyone else alone

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#4:1:A>
But now the <?> vital </?> size and the US are worrying after eight
consecutive good years

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#5:1:A>
Mr Alan Greenspan recently forecast that the US GDP growth rate
would only be two percent this year

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#6:1:A>
He also predicted that unemployment would rise to four point five
percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#7:1:A>
Computer sales both for personal and industrial uses has <?>
deslated </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#8:1:A>
Companies are inventing in new machinery the way they use to

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#9:1:A>
President Bush has repeatedly warn about the slow down and prescribe
rightly or wrongly tax cut as the medicine

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#10:1:A>
But statistics tells only half of the story

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#11:1:A>
The other half is being told through <?> annerdose </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#12:1:A>
Car companies are sacking workers by the thousands selection prices
and closing plants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#13:1:A>
General motors had shut down a whole division whole mobile

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#14:1:A>
Price verse is over <unc> one-word </unc> is US operations

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#15:1:A>
Auto part suppliers are badly affected

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#16:1:A>
The rapid affect is spreading throughout the economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#17:1:A>
US banks are titling landing and may yet call in more loans

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#18:1:A>
Magic mergers especially immediate and drug companies has stop
after the recent bleed

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#19:1:A>
And previous America <?> masons </?> haven't yet produce the
winners

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#20:1:A>
The overall value internet companies most never having earn a
profit has done venture capitalists

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#21:1:A>
The inflow tag and telecom sectors the power behind the new economy
are we can a

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#22:1:A>
Moreover US retailers had countered on Christmas two thousand sales
to tide them over

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#23:1:A>
But instead they are now left with huge inventories especially of
garments electronics cosmetics and toys

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#24:1:A>
Some of which came or re-exported from Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#25:1:A>
US Federal Reserve has reacted by cutting the prime rate twice
inside a months

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#26:1:A>
The first time is done so in fifteen years

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#27:1:A>
The open market committee at the reserve has been equally <unc>
one-word </unc> in its latest assessment

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#28:1:A>
Seeing consumers are holding back and credits are being squeezed

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#29:1:A>
Americans who previously spend their wage a boom and lifted the
global economy wisdom can continue to <unc> one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#30:1:A>
Here in Hong Kong our Financial Secretary appeals to be doing his
sums in isolation

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#31:1:A>
Mr Donald Tsang and his team has reported the Hong Kong GDP growth
rate of ten point seven percent for last year and forecast four point one
percent for this

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#32:1:A>
They haven't really read these numbers with a deflation rate of
three point seven percent in year two thousand which suggest the recovery was
more illusion than substance for most people

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#33:1:A>
Mr Tsang had to look no further and uh free mode property market to
understand the underlying stress in the economy and the lack of confidence

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#34:1:A>
Hot serious growth Hong Kong has had lately has been in an inflow
tax and export sectors

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#35:1:A>
But nearly all the listed internet stops are trading now at the
fashion of the highest level a year ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#36:1:A>
More are going under because there is no fresh capital coming in

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#37:1:A>
Exporters are say Americans are beginning to cancel or postpone
orders in anticipation of poor demands for the rest of the year

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#38:1:A>
European Union recovery is bonded to stop once it feels the impact
of the US slowdown

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#39:1:A>
Both send to Hong Kong high spending tourists who may delay their
<unc> one-word </unc> or cut back on shopping dining and
entertainment

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#40:1:A>
Hong Kong is try to diversify its appeal to tourists

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#41:1:A>
While there are now more South East Asian and Chinese from the
Mainland visiting Hong Kong these are expended

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#42:1:A>
This then means less foreign exchange

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#43:1:A>
The dramatic reversal of fortune is hitting Hong Kong severely at
the most difficult time

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#44:1:A>
We are now facing a huge budget deficit for the past year

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#45:1:A>
The Financial Secretary has few options if the growth rate <?>
lackens </?> and the revenue strike

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#46:1:A>
The government has for political reasons narrow the tax base
further in recent years

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#47:1:A>
This has forced middle and upper classes to pay more taxes so that
the others can enjoy the benefit

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#48:1:A>
Mr Tsang and his <?> destined </?> successor Mr Anthony Leung can
expect existing tax payers to go on carrying a heavier burden

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#49:1:A>
The government has increased some fees and charges <unc>
one-word </unc> the Liberal Party opposed and will continue to oppose

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#50:1:A>
People earning less because of the Mandatory Provident Fund are
sure to resist

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#51:1:A>
Small and media enterprises can afford to pay more

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#52:1:A>
To saying that Hong Kong taxes are among the lowest in the
industrialize world

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#53:1:A>
It  ' s more fiction than fact when we add in all the other charges

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#54:1:A>
The lower party think the alternative the tax increases should be
government authority

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#55:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> administration has preached but not
practiced

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#56:1:A>
Public expenditure continue to rise despite an advertise high
increase and <unc> one-word </unc> restructuring

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#57:1:A>
This is because civil servants are still too generous to themselves

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#58:1:A>
There are now more senior administrative positions than four years
ago before the Asian Financial Crisis

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#59:1:A>
We think that tax payers should not be asked to food the bill for
government over hiring and over paying in some cases

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#60:1:A>
This contradiction can persist

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#61:1:A>
The current budget which is being finalized must be adjusted to the
affect of the US slowdown and its impacts on Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#62:1:A>
But Financial Secretary Mr Donald Tsang must remember that Hong
Kong is economically not an island

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#63:1:A>
How history creates its talent is being decided right now

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#64:1:A>
As he put the finishing touches to a spell out budget there must
ban as a testimony of his confidence vision and understanding of the global
economy and Hong Kong  ' s part in it </I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-038#65:2:A>
I table the motion in Legislative Council last week

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#66:2:A>
I suggested that the government issue multiple visas to high
earning visitors from the Mainland

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#67:2:A>
I also suggested that add in investor category of mainland
immigrants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#68:2:A>
I was presently surprise that my motion passed overwhelmingly and
the secretary Regina Ip said my proposal will receive serious government
consideration

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#69:2:A>
Hong Kong has right now losing consumers

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#70:2:A>
Every weekend three hundred thousand people cross Lo Wu into
Shenzhen

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#71:2:A>
Last year alone they spent an estimated thirty five billion over
there equal to about fifty percent of our consumer spending

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#72:2:A>
We have to think other way to reserve the traffic and recover some
of the loss

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#73:2:A>
The way to do that is to allow high income people from the Mainland
to come to Hong Kong more easily to visit spend and in some cases live

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#74:2:A>
In recent years China has created a class of entrepreneurs
professionals and <?> ninety </?> expertise

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#75:2:A>
Typically a lawyer earns upward of ten thousand dollars a months a
technologist double as much and an executive fifty thousand or more

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#76:2:A>
Shenzhen just happen to be one of the highest earning cities in
China

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#77:2:A>
Many of these people in Shenzhen are from other regions of China

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#78:2:A>
We know that because each day there are at least a dozen flights
out of Shenzhen for Beijing alone

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#79:2:A>
We could get these people to spend weekends and holidays in Hong
Kong rather than in other cities if we make it easier for them to travel here

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#80:2:A>
The answer is a simple multiple entry visa

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#81:2:A>
Critics of my motion say they are afraid that these people would
over stay

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#82:2:A>
I don't buy that argument

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#83:2:A>
People of such an income level with steady employment are going to
go underground take jobs in construction site and restaurant or enter into a
life of <?> rise </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#84:2:A>
Other also say my motion if turn into a policy will discriminate
against the poor

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#85:2:A>
I don't buy that argument neither

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#86:2:A>
The fact is all countries discriminate if that  ' s the word against
visitors with some money and steady employment

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#87:2:A>
More and more Mainland Chinese are becoming tourists nowadays

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#88:2:A>
They found that ironic that it  ' s less bureaucratic for them to
travel to countries in Southeast Asia than to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#89:2:A>
We have become perhaps too arrogant in thinking all Chinese who
want to over stay in our city

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#90:2:A>
Those who have seen Paris London and San Francisco may find Hong
Kong the way we find it expensive rude and polluted

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#91:2:A>
The main problem is that our government has set a quota of one
thousand two hundred tourists from the Mainland a day where therefore forcing
people who want to come to pay between one and two thousand each for visa

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#92:2:A>
If we give people multiple visas as a one off fee we reduce their
cost and we also bring more businesses to our shops

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#93:2:A>
The more controversial part of my motion was my suggestion that the
government negotiate with the central government for a new investor category
of immigrants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#94:2:A>
Over the past four years since I return to Chinese sovereignty
China has developed at the pace we have never anticipated

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#95:2:A>
There are now million of ethnic Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#96:2:A>
Some of them are given exit visa to immigrant and live abroad

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#97:2:A>
I think it  ' s important that we recruit these people rather than
see them settle in Singapore Canada United States and so on taking their
talent and asset with them

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#98:2:A>
Right now Hong Kong has an exclusively family reunion immigration
policy towards the Mainland Chinese

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#99:2:A>
I support this programme I hire the one uh immigration policy to be
reviewed and broaden

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#100:2:A>
Each day we let in hundred and fifty people from the Mainland

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#101:2:A>
Nearly all of them are job seekers or young dependants of Hong
Kong residents from the lower income group

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#102:2:A>
They have contributed to the widening gap between the rich and the
poor in our society

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#103:2:A>
We must do something about this by letting in about fifty investor
immigrants from the Mainland a day to address the imbalance and create work
and other economic activities

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#104:2:A>
I think I  ' m reasonable in suggesting that these economic
immigrants should bring in at least five million each and have business
plants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#105:2:A>
This proposal is not uncommon among other world nations

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#106:2:A>
The United States for example ask for seven point eight billion
Hong Kong dollars Canada two million dollars Singapore six point five million
dollar and Australia three million dollars for each investor immigrants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#107:2:A>
The United States for example ask for seven point eight million
Hong Kong dollars Canadian two million dollars Singapore six point five
billion dollars and Australia three million dollars for each investor
immigrant

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#108:2:A>
We have to set a limit that  ' s neither too low nor too high

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#109:2:A>
Too low then it wouldn't do much for our economy and too high we
won't be able to persuade them to come

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#110:2:A>
There are also a bonus in bringing these successful people to Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#111:2:A>
Many of these new immigrants will have the contacts connections
and knowledge to help us seek business opportunity from where they came

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#112:2:A>
This is especially important for us as our other main trading
partners go into recession while China continues to boom

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#113:2:A>
I  ' m not so naïve as to ignore the dangerous of money laundering
in and attractive shady people to Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#114:2:A>
But I  ' m sure that the Chinese government will screw light those
people it qualifies for an exit visa to immigrate abroad

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#115:2:A>
Some critics accuse me of class discrimination by wanting to let
in the rich but realistically all other countries ' investor immigration
policy only let in the rich

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#116:2:A>
We should open our doors to those who can help us

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#117:2:A>
Since the government has accepted my proposal I urged it to act
quickly

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#118:2:A>
The longer we delay the more skilled educated and entrepreneurial
Chinese will choose elsewhere at our loss </I>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#119:3:A>
The consumption or sale tax proposal is not new the
government posted the idea in the late eighties at the time of huge surpluses

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#120:3:A>
The Financial Secretary of the day quickly withdrew the suggestion
because it  ' s look really in the face of a bursting treasury

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#121:3:A>
But now the issue has taken on urgency because of another fiscal
deficit and a new Financial Secretary eager to make it  ' s smart

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#122:3:A>
The Liberal Party agrees the present tax system is too narrow
unfair and distorted

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#123:3:A>
One hundred thousand people out of three point four million that
work paid most of the income and profit taxes without getting many tangible
returns

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#124:3:A>
They put out with this sort of socialism because that is the price
for stability

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#125:3:A>
Having a consumption tax may be a good move if that means making
seven million citizens give and not simply take from the <unc> one-word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#126:3:A>
Hong Kong also must have a balanced budget as prescribed by the
Basic Law but introducing a new tax can only be done during boom times which
these are not

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#127:3:A>
Government is not to provide the latest GDP growth forecast until
the end of the months but already bank economists have on their own estimated
that the annual growth could be as slow as one point eight percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#128:3:A>
The economists intelligence unit has suggested a figure below one
percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#129:3:A>
Hong Kong  ' s most important export market the United States has
all but gone into recession

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#130:3:A>
Corporate profit has vanished and companies are sacking workers by
the <?> tones </?>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#131:3:A>
American economists who once predicted the recovery in the latter
half of this year have postponed that we bond to some time in the middle of
next year

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#132:3:A>
Even the Mainland market is not drawing it  ' s a <?> death </?> in
recent years

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#133:3:A>
The story in the South Korea and Southeast Asia

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#134:3:A>
Japan has been in a slump for the past decade and the restricted
promise by radical Prime Minister will cause many more layoffs ten <unc>
one-word </unc> and cut backs

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#135:3:A>
Hong Kong is a slightly to whether the global economy  ' s storm and
find shape

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#136:3:A>
True the low interest rate may help the property market by easing
mortgage payment

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#137:3:A>
But then Hong Kong will feel the global economic pain eventually
as to impact from difficulties in its main market take time to <unc>
one-word </unc>

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#138:3:A>
Between late ninety eight and two thousand our economy rebounded
from the Asian Financial Crisis thanks to the booming high tech and export
sectors

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#139:3:A>
But now high tech is winding from the Nasdaq wars and the internet
and telecommunication stock collapse

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#140:3:A>
Importers in the United States Europe Union Australia <?> nature
</?> are casting or <?> skiing </?> back orders

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#141:3:A>
Our local retail businesses will suffer as consumers lose
confidence and a small shoppers go across the broader for bargains

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#142:3:A>
If the government would impose the consumption tax now it would
hurt local stores by compelling more people to spend less locally and spend
more in Shenzhen

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#143:3:A>
Early in the year the administration just introduce the Mandatory
Provident Fund that alone has posted a major burden on employers and
employees who have to allocate ten percent of salary to meet their new
obligations

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#144:3:A>
The money invested in the MPF skill is money out of immediate
retail circulation

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#145:3:A>
Any new tax is not acceptable until the economy has digested the
effect of MPF

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#146:3:A>
The government and its consultation paper says any <.> con </.>
tax will be modest

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#147:3:A>
Just as what all government say to lower public resistant to an
unpopular programme but the tax were also eventually he will have to raise a
low tax to justify the administrative cost for its collection

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#148:3:A>
The government conceived that a three percent consumption tax will
yield only eighteen billion result restraint the work on administrative cost

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#149:3:A>
There will be a temptation later to increase that net intake

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#150:3:A>
I would cite examples of other governments raising consumption
taxes in increments

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#151:3:A>
The British to start introduce a reasonable sale tax of five
percent that has since recent to seventeen point five percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#152:3:A>
The Canadians in the province of British Columbia place a heavy
combination of provision sales tax and value added tax that together increase
a purchase by thirty percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#153:3:A>
The French have to pay out a sales tax of twenty percent Americans
Australians and Europeans have experienced the same

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#154:3:A>
Such a tax like a drug to which any treasury can get hope and find
so hard to win

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#155:3:A>
There  ' s no doubt there where a consumption tax is introduced
there will be the start and not end of a cycle of tax increases

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#156:3:A>
The government will surely rationalize the extra tax of familiar
argument of how health care welfare education housing and some <?> re </?>
services may suffer if it does not raise the levy

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#157:3:A>
The Liberal Party opposes such a tax as a time of weak economics

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#158:3:A>
We urged the government to defer adding taxes and for that matter
fees and charges until the economy has become robust enough to take the booms

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#159:3:A>
Hong Kong once try as a tourist destination because of its
reputation as a shoppers  '  paradise

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#160:3:A>
A whole street of shops along Nathan Road <unc> one-word
</unc> practically to no one else than visitors

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#161:3:A>
The tourist trade as our second largest source of foreign exchange

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#162:3:A>
But over the past decade or so a combination of inflation a Hong
Kong currency pack to the US dollar high wages and labour benefits has eroded
that advantage

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#163:3:A>
Today many tourists can get better shopping bargains on the
Mainland Singapore and it  ' s hard to believe Japan

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#164:3:A>
Hong Kong is not only competing to <?> lower </?> tourists but
also competing to keep <unc> one-word </unc> from moving to less
costly rival cities

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#165:3:A>
More offering tax rebate and other in centres

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#166:3:A>
The consumption tax will raise the cost of living and may face out
those job producing companies which frankly have other options

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#167:3:A>
Before the government contempt a consumption tax it should first
consider a cut in expenditure especially civil servants pay and purse

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#168:3:A>
The administration has never tied of <unc> one-word </unc>
its <unc> one-word </unc> but worse are of course not match by this
when officials deal with themselves

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#169:3:A>
About sixty cents of every dollar the government spent goes
towards paying the salaries of the hundred and eight three thousand civil
servants and recently by the stroke of a plan three point eight billion was
spent to increase civil servants ' salaries

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#170:3:A>
A few months ago the government finalize a programme for early
retirement to <?> pomp </?> the <unc> one-word </unc> civil servants
and achieve high efficiency

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#171:3:A>
Just what wonderful in theory but the catch was that the cost for
terminating employment was so high and the benefit to retirees was so
generous that many more civil servants left and the Legislative Council
Finance Committee was asked to authorize an additional payment

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#172:3:A>
The government has to practise more than its preaching cost
cutting

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#173:3:A>
We had to live within our means and so why not civil servants

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#174:3:A>
Our government should be in better fiscal shape than it is today

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#175:3:A>
For example the government of Singapore has to pay twenty percent
of its expenditure on defence and diplomatic missions while our does not
because our central government bears full cost

<ICE-HK:S2B-038#176:3:A>
Only when the government has proved itself to be <unc>
one-word </unc> and the economy has strengthen can it more really
convince the public to support a consumption tax until then the Liberal Party
joins other against the consumption tax whose time is not now </I>
