<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#1:1:A>
So <,,> I offer you a glass of water first <{> <[> alright </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X2:1:Z>
<[> Thank you </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#3:1:A>
I think we can have our breakfast <,> in about fifteen minutes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X4:1:Z>
That  ' s fine </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#5:1:A>
Doris should be back

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#6:1:A>
Well let me just explain to you what what uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#7:1:A>
Well first I have to thank you for coming <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#8:1:A>
My friend who works in the University <,> he wants me to do this <,>
uhm cos they they have a project <,> and it  ' s all about uhm Asian Chinese
talking in English

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#9:1:A>
So what he wants to get now is a Hong Kong Chinese person so maybe
later on he want a Malaysian Chinese person then <&> laugh </&> I certainly
will recommend you

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#10:1:A>
And I think what he had did what he has done <,> previously uh was
recording certain things uhm certain conversation of other nationality which
I did not ask for <,> details so

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#11:1:A>
There  ' s a list I have to fill up and uhm <,> it  ' s uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#12:1:A>
Let me just show you this

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#13:1:A>
It  ' s tape recording conversations okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#14:1:A>
So <,> I have certain restrictions for doing that so I can't do it
with <,> uhm <?> Mamy </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X15:1:Z>
Alright </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#16:1:A>
I can't <,> make it up with <,> uhm a person to whom I seldom
speak English

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X17:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#18:1:A>
So I have to make it a natural conversation and the person
that I have to <,> uh speak English to

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#19:1:A>
So I can think of you at present because you are closer by

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X20:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#21:1:A>
A couple of my friends I mean they are Eurasian

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#22:1:A>
For example I mention that but <,> because we speak half Chinese
half English so the conversation for this may not be so good <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#23:1:A>
So <,> I don't think you  ' re interested in that so

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#24:1:A>
But if you do have a look

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X25:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#26:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X27:1:Z>
So what <{> <[> <unc> one-word </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#28:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{> I just wanted to be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X29:1:Z>
What what is the purpose of this whole project

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X30:1:Z>
Who is it for <,,> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#31:1:A>
Uhm he mentioned that it  ' s mainly for research <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#32:1:A>
It  ' s a research base so people who are studying Linguistics <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2> will will use it

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#33:1:A>
And uhm <,> I don't know I don't know what type of student <?> but
</?> not aiming apparently not aiming for Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X34:1:Z>
<[1> Uh uh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X35:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X36:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#37:1:A>
Uhm they

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#38:1:A>
I ask him the question of linguistics and I said you know to me is
<,> like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#39:1:A>
I really don't <,> don't know a lot

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X40:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#41:1:A>
Uhm <,> and to me after his explanation I am still blank

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X42:1:Z>
What just just uh off the subject of this thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X43:1:Z>
I just want to ask you about computers and children </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#44:1:A>
Computers and <{> <[> children </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X45:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X46:1:Z>
What do you think of kids of your your children  ' s age like
Jonathan is now four

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X47:1:Z>
Are you do you think it is wise for them to start learning
computer or playing computer games or anything related to educational
computers

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X48:1:Z>
What do you think about it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#49:1:A>
Uhm <,> for me I think that kids before six shouldn't <,>
concentrate too much or use using their eye muscles too much

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#50:1:A>
That  ' s only my personal <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> judgment <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#51:1:A>
And the reason I said that is because I spoke to a few <,> friends
some of them are teachers some of them are <,> uhm principals of the school

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#52:1:A>
And what they said is children before certain age actually at
different stages <,> they utilize or or they are powerful in certain type of
muscles

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#53:1:A>
So if you force the kid to <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> use the pen too
early <,> then later on uh it affects for example their brain certain part of
their brain muscle <{4> <[4> <,> or </[4> their eye <{5> <[5> muscle </[5>
<,> or <,> their <,> uh <,> hand muscle

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#54:1:A>
And so <,> therefore <,> you remember previously I mentioned about
not sending Jacqueline to kindergarten <{6> <[6> right </[6>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X55:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X56:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X57:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X58:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X59:1:Z>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X60:1:Z>
<[6> Right </[6> </{6> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#61:1:A>
And because they said kids before three <,> that is between
one and a half to about roughly three years old <,,> their developmental
stages are mainly on their <,> uh hearing <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> and their <,>
speaking <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#62:1:A>
So if you emphasize the kids or if you encourage the kids to
develop more on these parts <,> it helps their <,> future <{3> <[3>
development </[3> and <,> now I can see the result

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#63:1:A>
Do you remember I stop working a year <{4> <[4> ago </[4>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X64:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X65:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X66:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X67:1:Z>
<[4> Yeah </[4> </{4> uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#68:1:A>
And Jonathan was staying with my maid previously

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#69:1:A>
So before three years old he seldom talk

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X70:1:Z>
Oh right <{> <[> <unc> three words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#71:1:A>
<[> For there are two </[> </{> two reasons

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#72:1:A>
First I am not around <,> uh at home

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#73:1:A>
Secondly my maid who  ' s who used to spend the time with him that
one is <,> completely quiet <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#74:1:A>
He doesn't talk much so I can see that Jonathan <,> does not use
his mouth in communicating with people a lot <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#75:1:A>
He doesn't <,> speak so all he wants to do is just uhm <,> you know
like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X76:1:Z>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X77:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X78:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#79:1:A>
And I stop working last year so <.> Jon </.> Jacqueline was
about one and a half <,> to one and three quarter <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#80:1:A>
Maybe I am wrong so <,> I try to <,> communicate with her <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#81:1:A>
Just you know asking questions when when she say something I  ' ll
try to explain

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#82:1:A>
It was not <,> uh purposely doing that but what I want to do is I
want to stimulate her interest so naturally I talk a lot <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#83:1:A>
And now she is at school for about a week <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#84:1:A>
All the teachers at school are astonished by her <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> cos she speaks too much speaks too much not is is not that she just
<unc> multiple words </unc> like the like a parrot <{2> <[2> <,>
</[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#85:1:A>
She speak a whole sentence <,> and she can explain herself pretty
clearly <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#86:1:A>
And so right from the school bus driver to the teacher to her class
uhm uhm teacher and also the principal <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> everyone said oh
Jacqueline is famous already at school cos everyone like to hold her because
<,> she keeps on talking to you a lot <&> laugh </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#87:1:A>
I said uh oh I don't know whether it  ' s a compliment or it  ' s a
criticism but <&> laugh </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X88:1:Z>
<[1> Oh yeah </[1> </{> 

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#89:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#90:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#91:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#92:1:Z>
Is she enjoying school at the moment </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#93:1:A>
She start she start to like

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X94:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#95:1:A>
So so if you ask about computer uhm <,> I I would think if
kids well after the three between four and six uh I think it  ' s the eye
muscle

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X96:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#97:1:A>
So you you probably have noticed that Hong Kong <,> children
or Hong Kong persons are very short-sighted

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#98:1:A>
Did you notice that <{> <[> and most of them wear glasses </[>

<$Z> <X> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X99:1:Z>
<[> <unc> five words </unc> </[> </{> I  ' ve think
about it yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#100:1:A>
Right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X101:1:Z>
It  ' s true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#102:1:A>
Compare to all overseas even <.> o </.> other parts of uhm
Asia <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#103:1:A>
I </[> think if if you go around you will find eighty percent of
them wearing glasses

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X104:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X105:1:Z>
I think it  ' s uhm <unc> multiple words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#106:1:A>
And the the reason that they said is uh if you emphasize the
kid too much <,> with their eye muscle at a much earlier stage it would
deteriorate their eyes  '  uhm development so <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#107:1:A>
Again I don't know whether that  ' s true but I think they must have
some <.> psycholog </.> uh I mean some proving to that

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#108:1:A>
And if you develop the kids like if you force the kid to write too
early then naturally their eyes have to focus <,> too early and <,> that
would form their short-sighted

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X109:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> form </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#110:1:A>
So computer I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#111:1:A>
Some people mention <{> <[> about </[> reflection

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X112:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X113:1:Z>
That  ' s true </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#114:1:A>
Using the eye muscles too much <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#115:1:A>
Uhm <,,> one of my friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#116:1:A>
One of my friends send her daughter to this computer class

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#117:1:A>
She is about Jonathan  ' s age <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#118:1:A>
Probably she hasn't got short-sighted yet at present but I can see
that her eyes are a bit more <,,> closer together

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X119:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X120:1:Z>
How old is she </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#121:1:A>
She is only four

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#122:1:A>
Of of of course she likes it

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#123:1:A>
I mean <,> <{> <[> this </[> little girl likes the the computer
program

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#124:1:A>
Uh but I think again is the exposure the exposure to that cos she
just think it  ' s a toy

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#125:1:A>
She will just start playing

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X126:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> 

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X127:1:Z>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X128:1:Z>
But I was just thinking <,> on the basis of computer is there  ' s
a lot of <,> computer games which are not related to just play but <{> <[>
educational </[> uhm <,> programs where they <,> encourage the kid to think
and challenge the computer relating to development as they progress at school
like alphabet games or <?> acknowledging </?> certain words or certain
diagrams is that they having you having to buy books and you having to draw
things or <{> <[> <,> </[> get them to do it

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X129:1:Z>
That  ' s what I was trying to <{> <[> see <unc> multiple words
</unc> </[> age or is it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#130:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{> <[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#131:1:A>
Sorry <&> laugh </&> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#132:1:A>
I think you really want your kids to be super kids

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X133:1:Z>
No I think I I am just plain lazy uh sort of trying to think what
I should do with uh get a computer and let them challenge <{> <[> it </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#134:1:A>
<[> Did I </[> </{> mention to you about a seminar

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X135:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#136:1:A>
A super <,> a super kid seminar

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#137:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> the this let me think of the
<unc> one-word </unc> title of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#138:1:A>
I think the title is How To Bring The Best Of Your Children

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X139:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#140:1:A>
It started last August <&> cough </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#141:1:A>
Excuse me last July to last August and the speaker is a Malaysian
Chinese

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X142:1:Z>
Oh really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#143:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#144:1:A>
He studied actually I think in Malaysia and then he furthered his
studies in the States so he attended a lot of different types of seminars
things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#145:1:A>
Uhm <,,> and he said what interests him to do this kind of program
or seminar was a a subject or objective mainly on children is because he  ' s
got a young daughter

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#146:1:A>
I think must be his first child

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#147:1:A>
And he said a lot of things that the kid is doing or progressing
depends very much on how the adults guide the kid

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#148:1:A>
And he can't <,> just bring out a perfect kid uh because every kid
has different personality so he probably has planned much further ahead so
what he did is uh when his wife was pregnant he started you know reading a
lot of things etcetera <,> and eventually he quitted his job <,> and he just
wanted to specialize in children  ' s education and so he further his studies
in the States

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#149:1:A>
Uh so he came back to Malaysia Singapore I don't whether where is
his base probably between Malaysia and Singapore

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#150:1:A>
And uhm because he is US sort of educated so can he bring back a
lot of more open uhm idea things to the country <,> and he started this
program

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#151:1:A>
Uhm the first time he offered this is <,> must be <,> let me think
must be in July when I attended

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#152:1:A>
And he cut short the program from two days to one day because he
was told by the organizer in Hong Kong that uh you can't get so many
attendance on the weekend so you better just squeeze everything in one day
<{1> <[1> cos </[1> Hong Kong people are really pushy <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> so
<,> uh he started that program on a Saturday <,> and I attended

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#153:1:A>
It  ' s a full day seminar from eight thirty to about six <,> and
after that <,> the <.> attend </.> attendees like us still think that it  ' s
probably good to be a two days  '  program <,> because too many questions too
many things <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> are doing at one day and what he mentioned
about bringing the best of your children <,> is that at different stages

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#154:1:A>
He emphasized that as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#155:1:A>
At different stages kids are developing different types <{4> <[4>
of their </[4> muscles their cells so you have to aim at the right thing so
that the kid will be brought up properly <{5> <[5> <,> </[5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#156:1:A>
So he mentioned about the left brain the right <{6> <[6> brain
</[6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#157:1:A>
Did I mention that to you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X158:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X159:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#X164:1:Z>
No </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-033#165:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#166:1:A>
And he said sometimes if you find a kid <,> who is particularly
rebellious

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#167:1:A>
Everything you ask he is doing opposite to you and you always
think that why is he not <,> a good kid you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#168:1:A>
So <,> most parents define kid kids as good kid or naughty kids
right

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#169:1:A>
And <,,> he said these are not good terms if you try to bring up
<,> bring up your kids in a in a positive attitude

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#170:1:A>
You have to relate to the facts

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#171:1:A>
Uhm the uh the incidents

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#172:1:A>
So naughty means what

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#173:1:A>
Is it because he has spilled the juice because he has <,> uh he
hasn't done what you want him to do so bring <,> mention to him about what he
has done wrong <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but don't use the word <mention> you are
naughty boy </mention>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#174:1:A>
And <&> laugh </&> you know what after a lot of you know those
sort of things that he mention which is very very common

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#175:1:A>
I would say about ninety-five percent ninety percent of the
parents would do that

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#176:1:A>
Everything he mentioned is a very common reaction from the parent
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#177:1:A>
But it has certain uhm <,,> what  ' s the right word to use

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#178:1:A>
It has certain facts in the way he described it and he tried to
correct it so that we can <,> exercise that on the kid and you will see the
effect the next day <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#179:1:A>
So I remember he said about <mention> naughty </mention>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#180:1:A>
He said if you mention <mention> naughty </mention> to your boy
and use with your finger pointing at him <mention> you naughty boy </mention>
you see

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#181:1:A>
He said there  ' re two <,> uhm <,> disadvantages

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#182:1:A>
One is <,> is a psychological one cos with the finger pointing at
the kid you are much taller the kid is much shorter and that  ' s a very strong
<?> authoritarian </?> on him <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#183:1:A>
So he can't

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#184:1:A>
All he feels is the pressure on him <{4> <[4> like </[4> <,> just
because you  ' re bigger and stronger than I do then <,> then you  ' re more
forceful

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#185:1:A>
It doesn't mean that you are <,> uh as equal as them

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#186:1:A>
So he taught us one way

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#187:1:A>
When you want to teach your your child bend your knees down be at
the same level <&> laugh </&> so at least he will feel some <,,> equalism

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#188:1:A>
And then don't use your figure to point at him so instead you just
sort of be be comfortable with him and tell him what  ' s wrong

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#189:1:A>
If he has spilled the juice don't just say you naughty boy

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#190:1:A>
You have to say look what have you done

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#191:1:A>
You spilled the juice and this is not <,> a nice behaviour

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#192:1:A>
So tell him that because of what his action and it has caused you
discomfort or you dislike what he has done

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#193:1:A>
So he will recognize the fact rather than it  ' s me again mommy you
always pick on me and what have I done you know sort of in his mind is what
have I done

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#194:1:A>
You always call me naughty boy <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#195:1:A>
And he said the other thing is that you will find it the kid pick
it up what you said very quickly

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#196:1:A>
If you say he  ' s a naughty boy today tomorrow he will tell you
back

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#197:1:A>
He won't tell the mommy back

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#198:1:A>
He will tell whoever sibling he has

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#199:1:A>
If it  ' s younger than him then he will say you naughty girl

<ICE-HK:S1A-033#200:1:A>
Or any other younger kid than he he will say you naughty boy
