Dear Ying :

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#3:1>
How are you doing ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#4:1>
It is very nice to hear from you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#5:1>
Did you get your marks back yet ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#6:1>
I think you can achieve a very good standing for your high school
study , since I could imagine you , now and then , are always a very
hardworking girl .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#7:1>
Your letter is well written &dash; <-> espcially </-> <+> especially
</+> your handwriting . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#8:1>
I have got my statement of results for my first year study in
University of Toronto .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#9:1>
I got 3 A+s &obrack; financial accounting I and II , computer usage
&cbrack; , 2 As &obrack; micro and macro-economics &cbrack; and a poor
&ldquo; C &rdquo; for the Canadian History .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#10:1>
I will <-> recieve </-> <+> receive </+> scholarships for next
semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#11:1>
It is pretty good , isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#12:1>
Though I would have felt much better if I got a higher mark for my
history course . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#13:1>
I am going to summer school for 4 months , taking one course
&obrack; management accounting &cbrack; and working 4 days a week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#14:1>
I think I will become a permanent resident of Canada next year , and
after that , by 3 years living in Canada , become a Canadian citizen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#15:1>
&obrack; Is that answering your questions ? &cbrack; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#16:1>
I rent a small , nice attic near the university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#17:1>
My address is Apt. 3 , 193 Spadina Rd. , Toronto , Ont. M5R 2T9 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#18:1>
My phone number is &obrack; 416 &cbrack; 924-5932 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#19:1>
I moved here on June 1 , this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#20:1>
From your letter , I know that you  ' re longing to study in Canada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#21:1>
I should say it will be very good to study abroad , especially if you
are determined to work hard .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#22:1>
However , what I want to tell you is , you must be well prepared ,
not only English , but also the ability to live on your own . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#23:1>
How is your dad ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#24:1>
Is he still in Shanghai ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#25:1>
I miss him very much , please say &ldquo; Hi &rdquo; to him for me
when it is possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#26:1>
Do you help mom doing everything every day ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#27:1>
I bet you do . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#28:1>
How is your speech on the graduation ceremony ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#29:1>
Tell me if it is successful . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#30:1>
Aunt Ellen , Brian &ampersand; Arthur will be in Hong Kong in weeks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#31:1>
I am sure you will meet each other upon then .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#32:1>
I hope I can visit Hong Kong some day as well , though I am not able
to do that now &dash; I have to go to school and work plus I cannot afford it
for the time being .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#33:1>
&obrack; Just kidding &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#34:1>
I don't think you will be too busy to write to me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#35:1>
Send me your pictures if you can &dash; I cannot imagine what you
look like now &dash; though I still remember everything stupid and
interesting when we were together .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#36:1>
Tell dad and mom I wish everything best to them . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#37:1>
All the best !

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#38:1>

Dear Lynn :

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#41:2>
How are you doing ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#42:2>
It is awfully nice to hear from you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#43:2>
I should say your English is pretty good , though with a couple of
trivial mistakes &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#44:2>
anyway , what you need now is practice .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#45:2>
From the style you are writing , I guess you write quite often in
English , is that true ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#46:2>
But bear in mind , write more in English .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#47:2>
It will do good in the future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#48:2>
From my experience , to understand what others are talking about or
to speak to somebody else is easy , believe it or not &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#49:2>
it just takes time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#50:2>
However , in order to write English fluently , you need to practice a
lot . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#51:2>
Thanks for your congratulations .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#52:2>
I should say I am neither &ldquo; genius &rdquo; nor &ldquo; gifted
person &rdquo; &dash; in your words .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#53:2>
It is not as hard as you imagined before as you actually begin to
study .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#54:2>
However , the most important factor in order to be successful , is
always hard work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#55:2>
I believe I work harder than most guys in the university .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#56:2>
Besides , three years of study in Fudan University is really helpful .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#57:2>
Hopefully you can come here when you are 20 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#58:2>
By that time , I may be working already .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#59:2>
I am willing to help whenever you want .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#60:2>
Maybe I can tell you what you should do now , how to prepare for the
future , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#61:2>
First and most important , learn as much English as possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#62:2>
Watching movies may be an easy way .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#63:2>
Besides , you should make up your mind to work hard when you are
determined to come over .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#64:2>
Perhaps more important is to be &ldquo; determined &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#65:2>
Be determined to achieve the goal you set .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#66:2>
I know you are a smart girl , you will do well if you are &ldquo;
determined &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#67:2>
I went to the airpot this morning with Aunty Ellen , Arthur and
Brian .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#68:2>
By the time you receive this letter , you must have met each other
already . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#69:2>
How is dad ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#70:2>
Still in Hong Kong or not ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#71:2>
I know he used to blame me as if I were the worst person ever live in
the world , however , I don't care anymore .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#72:2>
Wish him ever good luck .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#73:2>
Did he watch the World Cup soccer game ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#74:2>
It only comes in cable TV &obrack; you have to pay monthly fee to be
able to watch it &cbrack; in Toronto , so I have to go back home on weekends
to watch some of the games . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#75:2>
What is your plan in summer ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#76:2>
Do you go to school , have a summer job , or just take it easy ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#77:2>
It must be fun for you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#78:2>
I am looking forward to your pictures &dash; however , whatever
you or others tell me , I still cannot imagine you are &ldquo; fat &rdquo;
now &dash; You are always a skinny little girl in my memory . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#79:2>
All the best !

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#80:2>
Don't forget to say &ldquo; Hi &rdquo; for me to Dad and Mom .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#81:2>
Love

July 17 , 90

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#84:3>
Dear Lynn:

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#85:3>
Thanks for your letter and picture .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#86:3>
You look prettier than before , I should say - but still I can
recognize you without any problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#87:3>
I am glad you are taking Japanese in the summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#88:3>
Have you started already ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#89:3>
Is the course interesting ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#90:3>
For me Japanese is the most difficult language I  ' ve ever encountered
&dash; I tried to learn it two years ago when I was still in <O> a place name
deleted </O> , but I gave up only two weeks later .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#91:3>
I may learn it in some time but not now , since I have something more
important to do . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#92:3>
It is nice for you to have a job in summer , even though it is
volunteer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#93:3>
You can still gain valuable experiences through it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#94:3>
What do you do when you are working ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#95:3>
Do you enjoy it ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#96:3>
Regarding your question about working in Canada as a part-time
student , being a visa student , you must obtain the Employment Authorization
before you can legally work in Canada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#97:3>
It is very hard to get the Employment Authorization , however .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#98:3>
But it is possible to get a summer Employment Authorization for you
to work in the summer &dash; because the summer vacation is usually 4 months
in length so that you can still make some money .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#99:3>
Furthermore , you are usually allowed to work on campus &dash; such
as in the library , student cafeteria and so on even during the semesters .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#100:3>
Besides , to be the worst , if you work in the Chinese restaurants
as a waitress , you do not need any working permit at all &dash; as far as
you can speak Cantonese and maybe a little bit English &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#101:3>
However , I should remind you that to work in restaurants is hard .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#102:3>
The tuition fees for a visa student is about &dollar;6,000 a
year &obrack; for Canadian citizen it is only &dollar;2,000 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#103:3>
Plus you have to pay for textbooks , school supplies for about
&dollar;500 a year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#104:3>
For a far from luxury living you need at least &dollar;500 each
month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#105:3>
So add together , you need around &dollar;13,000 a year to be able
to get along .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#106:3>
Income from part-time job varies according to the nature of the work
, but I think it is impossible to earn &dollar;13,000 by just having a
part-time job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#107:3>
So , you still need help from others in terms of financial
assistance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#108:3>
How is mom ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#109:3>
Is she busy doing everything ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#110:3>
I think you will help anyway . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#111:3>
How is your graduation dinner ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#112:3>
It looks nice in the picture .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#113:3>
I  ' ll have a test tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#114:3>
A case study and a computer assignment will be due in the following
weeks .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#115:3>
Final exam is in mid-August , so I am getting pretty busy recently .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#116:3>
I  ' ve got my driving licence for several months , but I still
cannot afford a car &dash; the insurance premium , fuel , parking add up to a
sky-high figure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#117:3>
Enclosed is one of my pictures &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#118:3>
it is not very well focused &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#119:3>
Anyway I don't take pictures oftenly . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#120:3>
Say Hi to everybody for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#121:3>
Tell Arthur I will get the magazine for him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#122:3>
Keep in Touch .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#123:3>
With best regards .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#124:3>

Dear Lynn :

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#128:4>
How are you doing ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#129:4>
By the time you receive this letter , you probably have received
your marks for your exams already .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#130:4>
Are they good ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#131:4>
I will have my final exam for the summer course next Wednesday
&obrack; Aug 15th &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#132:4>
After that I will have almost three weeks off , which will be very
nice to me &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#133:4>
I plan to have a trip to Waterloo with my friend for a day .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#134:4>
I also want to go to see the Metro Toronto Zoo , as well .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#135:4>
However , for now I have to study really hard for the exam . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#136:4>
How is your Japanese course ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#137:4>
How many hours do you go every week ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#138:4>
I hope you really enjoy it and do learn something out of it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#139:4>
I can understand the volunteer job is quite tedious for you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#140:4>
However , you really have to get used to it , for as far as I know ,
if you come here in two years , the job you can get then will be even worse
&dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#141:4>
Some of the employers really make a hard time for you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#142:4>
I told grandpa about your plan to study overseas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#143:4>
They really appreciated it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#144:4>
However , they want me to tell you that you should learn to take
care of yourself from now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#145:4>
For example , you should learn how to cook for yourself , wash
dishes after meals , do the laundry for mom and dad maybe etc .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#146:4>
In short , what I realize is they want you to have the <-> ablity
</-> <+> ability </+> of living on your own . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#147:4>
It is very nice and cool now in Toronto .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#148:4>
I guess it is still pretty hot and humid now in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#149:4>
Do you meet Aunt Ellen and Arthur , Brian oftenly ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#150:4>
They gonna come back soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#151:4>
Please tell them I have already ordered the clothes for Brian ,
thanks ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#152:4>
I often think of the nicest days we spent together in Hangzhou
as well &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#153:4>
Hope some day we can have the same good time again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#154:4>
Jingjing is working all right now , and she told me last time she
was going to night school studying English too . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#155:4>
How are Dad and mom ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#156:4>
Is Dad still in Shanghai ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#157:4>
Well , have to go to school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#158:4>
Hope to hear from you soon .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#159:4>
All the best !

Dear Lynn :

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#164:5>
How are you doing ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#165:5>
Did you start your classes yet ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#166:5>
How many courses are you taking this semester ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#167:5>
I have already got your letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#168:5>
Since it is the beginning of the school year , I am a sort of busy
&dash; you know .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#169:5>
Excuse me for writing to you so late . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#170:5>
I feel really sorry for your grandmother .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#171:5>
I know your feeling of losing the dearest person in the world .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#172:5>
I was shocked at the news too .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#173:5>
However , it will be hard for you to forget .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#174:5>
Wish her ever happy in the heaven &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#175:5>
God bless everyone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#176:5>
This year I am going to take six courses .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#177:5>
Marketing , Business Finance , Financial Accounting Theory and
Policy , Marketing Management , Legal Enviroment of Business in Canada and
International Economics .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#178:5>
I have approximately ten hours of class every week .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#179:5>
Besides , I have to work 2 days in the shoe<-> stone</-> <+> store
</+> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#180:5>
It is really nice and cool now in Toronto &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#181:5>
like winter in Hong Kong &dash; that is what the grandma said .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#182:5>
Yesterday the temparature went down to 5&degree;C .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#183:5>
You can really feel the cool air , especially in the evening .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#184:5>
Maple leaves started turning red and yellow , and sometimes you can
find several different colors on a single tree .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#185:5>
Beautiful eh ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#186:5>
I enjoy it so much that <-> everyday </-> <+> every day </+> I take
a walk of about half an hour &dash; just watching .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#187:5>
I hope you and someone else can be here &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#188:5>
I can show you the startling beauty of the nature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#189:5>
From your letter , I can see your English being improved every
now and then .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#190:5>
However , you should pay special attention to your grammar &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#191:5>
try to break long sentences into short ones , and use the words you
are <-> farmiliar </-> <+> familiar </+> with .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#192:5>
Do not make things too complicated at the beginning . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#193:5>
Oh , I should tell you , as usual , I got an &ldquo; A &rdquo;
in my &ldquo; Management Accounting &rdquo; course which I took in the summer .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#194:5>
How is dad ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#195:5>
Still in Shanghai ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#196:5>
Do you , as I told you before , help your mom with the household
works everyday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#197:5>
To be clear , please do the laundry and wash dishes after each meal
&dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#198:5>
I will check it out with others later , see if you follow my &ldquo;
instructions &rdquo; . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#199:5>
Do not be too concerned with the marks you got in the exam &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#200:5>
As far as you have done your best , still I will say congratulation
to you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#201:5>
Enclosed is a picture I took in the Zoo .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#202:5>
Do you like it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#203:5>
All the best !

Dear Lynn :

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#208:6>
How are you doing ?

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#209:6>
It has been long time for me to write to you !

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#210:6>
I feel really sorry for this .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#211:6>
Thank you so much for your nice Christmas card .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#212:6>
I gave my card to Aunt Ellen when she went back to Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#213:6>
But I guess she forgot to give it to you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#214:6>
Anyway , it should be Chinese New Year when you receive this ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#215:6>
I wish you a very happy new year &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#216:6>
enjoy !

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#217:6>
And should you also give my best wishes to your Dad and Mom &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#218:6>
I miss you all . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#219:6>
I have a good news for you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#220:6>
I have got the landing paper &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#221:6>
from now on , I am a landed immigrant in Canada , and within two or
three years , I will become a Canadian citizen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#222:6>
It is really good ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#223:6>
especially when I am still in university , I am eligible for
government bursaries and loans .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#224:6>
Sounds good , isn't it ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#225:6>
How is school ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#226:6>
I still do not understand how many years it will take for you to go
to university ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#227:6>
I promise I will do my best to help you should you decide to come to
Canada . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-012#228:6>
Is dad still in Shanghai ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#229:6>
I have several friends who are now working in the Textile Import &
Export Company in Shanghai &obrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#230:6>
I do not know the exact name of the company in English , which might
be different from above &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#231:6>
If dad feel like to get any help from them , I can give him their
phone numbers and names , so that he can contact them . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#232:6>
It is freezing now in Toronto &dash; &minus;20&degree;C sometimes
&dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#233:6>
Can you imagine that ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#234:6>
Again I apologize for not to write to you for so long &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#235:6>
I do not mean to do that .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#236:6>
I am pretty busy these days &dash; lots of work , just as always .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#237:6>
OK , feel free to write to me whenever you have time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#238:6>
Wish all the best !

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#239:6>
Love

<ICE-HK:W1B-012#240:6>
