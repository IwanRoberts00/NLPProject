<ICE-HK:W2C-016#3:1>
CIVIL servants yesterday defied a Government deadline to reply to
a pay rise proposal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#4:1>
They said they were planning to take action on Monday to protest
against the offer , and accused the Government of ignoring demands for
compensation for what they see as a 3.5 per cent shortfall in rises in 1990
and 1991 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#5:1>
The civil servants said they would not co-operate in negotiations
with the Government on salary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#6:1>
The Government announced on Tuesday a pay rise of 9.76 per cent
for officers whose salary is above &dollar;25,830 , and 10.66 per cent for
other officers .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#7:1>
The offers are based on the annual Pay Trend Survey of wage rises in
the private sector . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#8:1>
The vice-chairman of the Model Scale One Consultative Council , Li
Ping-yu , said : &ldquo; We have expressed so much of our views but the
Government has not taken account of them in making its decision . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#9:1>
He said an alliance of civil service councils would discuss
further action . </p> </I>

<bold> Macleod rules out Budget amendments despite attacks </bold>
</h> <h>

<bold> By LINDA CHOY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#12:2>
DESPITE Chinese attacks on the planned Budget deficit , Financial
Secretary Mr Hamish Macleod said yesterday no amendments would be made . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#13:2>
&ldquo; I don't think anyone is really expecting any amendments
to the Budget , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#14:2>
&ldquo; What people are asking for really is that we all look
seriously at the points they  ' ve made and , in particular , of course ,
people are beginning to signal what their priorities are during the coming
year . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#15:2>
He described the reaction to the deficit budget as &ldquo;
generally acceptable &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#16:2>
Chinese officials quickly denounced the plan to have a deficit
budget as soon as it was announced earlier this month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#17:2>
A report from the Bank of China  ' s Hongkong and Macau regional
office accused the Government of cutting the reserves &ldquo; on purpose
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#18:2>
Responding to criticism of a lack of provisions to deal with the
territory  ' s inflation , Mr Macleod reiterated that there was no solution to
the problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#19:2>
&ldquo; Sometimes people asked for transparency but when they get
it , they don't appreciate it .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#20:2>
I  ' ve been very transparent on inflation over the years that there
isn't any solution .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#21:2>
That  ' s the fact , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#22:2>
&ldquo; I think inflation is a problem , I think it  ' s important
that we don't pretend it  ' s any easy problem to solve , I think everyone
accepts that it isn't easy but we have to keep trying . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#23:2>
On the interim sandwich class housing scheme , Mr Macleod said he
remained open-minded on it and details should be finalised after the
Government had collected the opinion of the public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#24:2>
Asked if the Government intended to remove the 70 per cent
mortgage ceiling , Mr Macleod said : &ldquo; We are not saying it  ' s cast in
concrete forever but , at the moment , I haven't seen any figures which would
persuade me that the time has come to move on that . &rdquo; </p> </I>

<bold> &lsquo; Delay &rsquo; in backing for women  ' s rights </bold>
</h> <h>

<bold> By LINDA CHOY </bold> </h 
 

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#27:3>
LEGAL backing for women  ' s rights has been delayed by the
Government  ' s consultation exercise on the issue , the Association of
Business and Professional Women claims . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#28:3>
Despite the endorsement of legislators for the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women &obrack; CEDAW
&cbrack; , the Government has decided to consult the public before finalising
its policy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#29:3>
An inter-departmental working group is working on a green paper ,
due out this year , which would state the options for protecting the rights
of women . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#30:3>
&ldquo; It is totally unnecessary to take months to create a
green paper to consult the public on an issue which has been widely agreed by
the people of Hongkong , &rdquo; said Miss Catherine Ng Wah-hung , a
spokesman for the association . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#31:3>
Many women  ' s groups had called for legislative protection for
women and many legislators agreed that Hongkong should ratify the CEDAW , she
added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#32:3>
But the Principle Assistant Secretary &obrack; Youth &cbrack; of
the City and New Territories Administration , Miss Susie Ho Shuk-yee , said
the Government had no intention of delaying the move . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#33:3>
She said there was a need to gauge public opinion and educate the
public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#34:3>
The report will look at extending CEDAW and the formation of a
Women  ' s Commission . </p> </I>

FIVE children orphaned when their parents drowned on a fishing
trip last Saturday began to pick up the pieces of their lives yesterday ,
even though their father  ' s body is still missing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#38:4>
The boy and four girls returned to school after attending their
mother  ' s funeral in Macau on Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#39:4>
Mrs Ip Ng Kwai-ho was drowned after she tripped over a rope and
fell overboard .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#40:4>
Her husband , Mr Ip Kam-yau , dived in to rescue her but has not been
seen since . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#41:4>
The children were left with &dollar;1,600 in cash , and little
else . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#42:4>
But readers of the <it> South China Morning Post </it> have so
far donated about &dollar;200,000 since their tragic story began on May 17 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#43:4>
Their grandmother , Mrs Ip Ho Kwai-ho , who is taking care of the
five , thanked the donors for their generosity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#44:4>
She said she could not imagine how the family would have survived
without such assistance . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#45:4>
&ldquo; It is amazing that so many people in the community came
forward to offer help .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#46:4>
I  ' m so thankful to them , &rdquo; the 73-year-old said at her Tuen
Mun home . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#47:4>
She said the money would be used to help pay for the children  ' s
education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#48:4>
The youngest girl , two-year-old Ip Mei-ling , will start
kindergarten in September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#49:4>
The others &dash; Sau-chun , 12 , Kai-fai , 10 , Mei-yee , nine ,
and Sao-i , seven &dash; will continue their schooling as long as the family
can support them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#50:4>
Their aunt , Miss Ip Ah-mui , said they &ldquo; pleaded for their
mum to wake up ... they are too young to understand what happened &rdquo; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#51:4>
The youngsters were quiet yesterday about the loss of their
parents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#52:4>
Sau-chun bustled around the others in the house , taking special
care of the toddler , Mei-ling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#53:4>
Sau-chun said she wanted to stay at school . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#54:4>
&ldquo; I am still at Primary Six and I don't know what I will do
after that .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#55:4>
I don't know .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#56:4>
I have not been told . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#57:4>
&ldquo; I think I  ' ll go to secondary school , &rdquo; she said .

READERS of the <it> South China Morning Post </it> have donated
&dollar;433,000 to the tragic Ip children , whose parents died in a fishing
boat accident two weeks ago . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#61:5>
Ip Sau-chun , 12 , was orphaned , along with her brother Kai-fai
, 10 , and sisters Mei-yee , nine , Sao-I , seven , and Mei-ling , two . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#62:5>
They are being cared for by their grandmother , Mrs Ip Ho Kwai-ho
, 73 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#63:5>
The accident has left Sau-chun worrying about the future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#64:5>
&ldquo; I don't know what is going to happen .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#65:5>
Things happened so suddenly that you don't know what will come next ,
&rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#66:5>
On May 16 , her father Mr Ip Kam-yau , went missing after diving
into the sea to save Mrs Ip Ng Kwai-ho , who had fallen off their fishing
boat near Zhuhai . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#67:5>
Sau-chun said she would probably work to look after the family .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#68:5>
She plans to go to vocational training school when she finishes
primary education in September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#69:5>
Her grandmother said she was very grateful to those who had given
money . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#70:5>
&ldquo; The people are so generous and they have given us so much
support during this difficult period , &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#71:5>
The <it> Post </it> is making arrangements with the Social
Welfare Department for the management of the money . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#72:5>
Mr Lawrence Ling Dor , assistant district social welfare office
of Tuen Mun , said they could set up a Director of Social Welfare
incorporated account . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#73:5>
&ldquo; We will make sure that the money is spent on the children
and their grandmother and not misused , &rdquo; said Mr Ling . </p> </I>

<bold> Plan to tell residents of welfare facilities </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#76:6>
THE Government may inform prospective home buyers about nearby
social welfare facilities to prevent a recurrence of the strong opposition
from Laguna City residents to facilities for the mentally handicapped , the
Commissioner for Rehabilitation said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#77:6>
Mr Allan Chow Shou-shun told the Legislative Council  ' s welfare
panel that the Secretary for Planning , Environment and Lands would discuss
details of the arrangement with large property agencies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#78:6>
Legislators at the two-hour meeting were concerned about the
Government  ' s strategy to deal with similar situations in future when an
additional 30 social welfare centres will come into service by 1996 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#79:6>
United Democrats legislator Mr Yeung Sum said the Government
should respect the residents  '  rights to know the kinds of social facilities
in their neighbourhood . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#80:6>
Independent legislator Mr Eric Li Ka-cheung agreed that home
buyers should be informed .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#81:6>
He suggested the Social Welfare Department could take on the
responsibility instead of the Secretary for Planning , Environment and Lands
to speed up communication . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#82:6>
However , the Director of Social Welfare , Mr Ian Strachan , said
the public should be aware of the increasing number of such centres in the
territory in the near future . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#83:6>
Mr Strachan also pledged to step up public education in response
to the concerns of legislators about the resentment among residents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#84:6>
Meanwhile , the discussion on the allocation of youth centres in
new towns almost turned into a row yesterday when legislators asked Mr
Strachan to submit details of the relocation plan and consult Legco before
carrying out the proposals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#85:6>
Mr Strachan said there was great difficulty with such a request .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#86:6>
&ldquo; I  ' m responsible for the operation of social work
services and I have to ultimately make the decision , not this panel .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#87:6>
I  ' m not prepared to let this panel make decision on operational
matters , &rdquo; he said . </p> </I>

<bold> No plans for elevator licensing </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#89:7>
<bold> By LINDA CHOY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#90:7>
THE Labour Department has no plans to license lifts on
construction sites or their operators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#91:7>
Deputy Chief Factory Inspector Dominic Mak Hung-kae said after a
meeting with unionists yesterday that the present mechanism was sufficient to
guarantee the safety of elevators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#92:7>
&ldquo; There is a legal provision on the safety of these
elevators and , at present , we see no need to introduce a licensing system ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#93:7>
The design and structure of the elevators would be subject to
safety requirements and factory inspectors would conduct periodic checks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#94:7>
Licensing would only mean issuing a certificate , he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#95:7>
Unlike those in industrial , commercial and residential buildings
, elevators on construction sites did not need to be licensed , Mr Mak said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#96:7>
But he agreed to consider it when a working group of the Labour
Department compiles its report . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#97:7>
Legislative Councillor Tam Yiu-chung and unionists were
disappointed at the department  ' s position . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#98:7>
Mr Tam said legislation did not provide enough guarantees .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#99:7>
The threat could only be eliminated by the licensing of elevators and
their operators . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#100:7>
Unionists believed a licensing system would ensure the elevators
were checked when the licence was renewed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#101:7>
The chairman of the Hongkong Construction Industry Employees
General Union , Poon To-chuen , said the Government should ban all elevators
of the type in the accident until the cause had been identified . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#102:7>
He said the Government should have learnt from a similar
accident at a Telford Garden construction site in 1979 , where six people
were killed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#103:7>
The Labour Department has set up a working group to deal with
compensation for the victims of the accident . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#104:7>
It will offer victims  '  relatives an emergency loan of
&dollar;20,000 . </p> </I>

<bold> Five seats at centre of liberals  '  strategy </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> DISTRICT BOARD ELECTIONS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#107:8>
THE small &ldquo; l &rdquo; liberal coalition of the United
Democrats of Hong Kong &obrack; UDHK &cbrack; and Meeting Point is
concentrating on five strategically important seats in North District in a
bid to boost its chance of winning next year  ' s Legislative Council poll .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#108:8>
Only five candidates have been fielded by the alliance for next
month  ' s election in North District , where an understanding has been reached
with traditional rural forces on the deployment of candidates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#109:8>
Meeting Point legislator Tik Chi-yun , who is over-seeing the
party  ' s campaign in the district , said it could have fared well in six or
seven constituencies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#110:8>
&ldquo; Because of the composition of the North District Board ,
we will not become the majority even I few grab seven seats . After all , it
is not our goal to dominate the district body, &rdquo; Mr Tik said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#111:8>
&ldquo; Besides , we have been able to maintain a good working
relationship with some of the rural representatives in the district .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#112:8>
We do not want to spoil this in the district board election. &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#113:8>
He said that although the group was confident it could have won
as many as seven seats , it would not do so at the expense of damaging its
co-operative relationship with traditional rural forces . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#114:8>
He remained adamant that it was crucial for the liberals to gain
support from public housing estates , whose residents would constitute much
of the electorate in the 1995 Legco polls . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#115:8>
Mr Tik said the alliance was keen on five seats in public
housing estates , namely Tin Ping , Choi Yuk Tai , Choi Yuen , Cheung Wah and
Wah Ming . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#116:8>
The total of 96,486 voters in the five constituencies represents
about 40 per cent of the total electorate in the North District as proposed
recently by the Boundary and Election Commission . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#117:8>
It is expected that four seats will go to the liberals , given
Meeting Point  ' s previous work in the district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#118:8>
But alliance candidate Simon Ngai Wing-yee will face fierce
opposition in the Wah Ming constituency , where he is confronted by incumbent
Wan Chung-ping from the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong &obrack; DAB &cbrack; , and the Liberal Party  ' s Chan King-hung .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#119:8>
In the Tin Ping constituency , the alliance  ' s Charles Chan
Kin-hung is up against former UDHK member Au Wai-kwan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#120:8>
It is expected the seats will be divided between the liberals
and the rural forces , with some seats being taken by the DAB . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#121:8>
The Liberal Party has three candidates running in Wah Ming ,
Luen Wo Hui and Fan Sheung .

<ICE-HK:W2C-016#122:8>
The party has been criticised for its lack of grassroots connections .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#123:8>
The DAB has fielded six candidates , most of them standing
against the liberals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#124:8>
DAB candidates Wong Chi-wah will run against Chan Hon-lam , who
is backed by the rural sector , in the Sheung Shui Wai constituency . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-016#125:8>
Mr Chan is backed by Regional Council chairman Cheung Yan-lung ,
and also rural leader and elected district board member Pang Hang-yin . </p>
