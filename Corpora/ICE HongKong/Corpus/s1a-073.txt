<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#1:1:A>
Well I guess it  ' s very <,> complicated for different group of
Hong Kong people because <,> many <,> many uh <,> uh rich people or educated
<,> young couples or educated young man <,> they don't found found it very
<,> frightening <,> or there  ' re not much conflicts to them <,> for you know
unmarried young people because if they  ' re educated they can <,> you know
they can uh <,,> to make some money and then <,,> you know enroll for the
emigration <,> and then they can go easily because many countries doesn't
have very uh <,> you know firm or or or <,> strict rule to the emigration <,>
for those people

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#2:1:A>
But you know <,> as far as I know Hong Kong <,> most of the Hong
Kong people are still they like Hong Kong very much <,> but <,> they don't
like China <,> or or they want uh they don't want <,> China to be a <,> ruler
<,> of this place <,> as they thought it may <,> <?> and </?> the China China
government will <,> screw up all the things in Hong Kong <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#3:1:A>
You know <,> so <,> but for like I said for for <,> rich people or
educated <,> young people <,> they will not really afraid I mean be afraid of
<,> the coming of ninety seven <,> but for people like workers <unc> two
words </unc> workers or <,> factory workers <,> or even <,> some uh <.>
youn </.> very young people or or students <,> uh they may be they may have
<.> co </.> uh <,> conflicts because they want to go or they want to live <,>
uhm but they could not according to the condition they have

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#4:1:A>
So <,> uhm there are still a a <.> n </.> <,> number of people that
they really are positive <,> they feel positive about <,> approaching of
ninety seven <,> because <,> uhm <,> they still want to be in Hong Kong and
do something <,> uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X5:1:Z>
I think that <,> the average number that can leave if they actually
want to go <,> I was told only one <,> out of every ten people have the
ability to leave Hong Kong <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> that <,> because of finances
or lack of education that uhm very few people have a choice

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X6:1:Z>
You know ninety percent <,> according to that statistic <,> have a
choice that <.> re </.> I mean don't have a choice they have to <.> s </.>
they have to stay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X7:1:Z>
Well <,> I think too

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X8:1:Z>
When I ask you know taxi drivers and other people this question <,>
about half of them say <,> everything is going to be alright <,> no problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X9:1:Z>
I think <{2> <[2> they they </[2> they  ' re trying to convince
themselves <,> that is just <,> Hong Kong will always be the same you know
fifty years no change and then it seems like the other one say <,> oh it  ' s
going to be terrible you know I can't wait to get out of here <,> how can
this happen <,> to us

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X10:1:Z>
But <,> you seem to found find very people that are in the middle
<,> that kind of say <,> well <,> uh yes there  ' s going to be a lot of change
<,> it won't be the same <,> but maybe <,> uhm <unc> several words
</unc> in some ways there will be some good things that come I I haven't
heard that <,> yet it  ' s usually just been uhm either everything is going to
be okay or oh it  ' s going to be <,> terrible

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X11:1:Z>
Is anyone in your family planning to <,> leave <,> Hong Kong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#12:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#13:1:A>
<[2> Uh uh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#14:1:A>
Uh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#15:1:A>
Couples of years ago they talk about that <,> but <,> I don't think
they  ' re now working <,> on emigration or enrollment for their emigration

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#16:1:A>
But <,> well <,> I guess <,> what like my parent <,> they  ' re they  ' re
<,> they think they are too old too think about that <,> or just uh they will
think <,> well there  ' s not many years left for them so <,> they don't care
what happen to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#17:1:A>
And the childrens like me as grown up and have our own decision <,>
they try they they try to convince us but <,> uh some of the kids in in our
family <,> told them that <,> we want to stay <,> in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#18:1:A>
So <,> so they you know they they give up convincing us <,> uh to
think about that <,> you know emigration

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#19:1:A>
But uh but just according to what you said like <,> uh you
<unc> several words </unc> about or talk to people <,> seems like to
be in the middle <,> that I I guess <,> as far as I know many people <,> uh
is in that status or in that situation not because they think that or or they
have the middle uh mind that because they confuse about their future

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#20:1:A>
Like <,> they they hope that they want to <,> they want China China
government to be doing good in Hong Kong <,> but they don't

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#21:1:A>
At the same time they want they don't want to live in a country <,>
that they  ' re not belongs to <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#22:1:A>
Uh yeah many people <,> they don't think about emigration not
because they don't want to go <,> but at the same time they don't to live in
a place that <,> every everybody look different to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#23:1:A>
They they speak different language or even <,> they couldn't find a
good job over there or they may not be treated as <,> equal as they <,> they
<.> wa </.> they was in Hong Kong <,> or <,> you know <,> in the same way
that they live in Hong Kong so <,> you know they make them to be the middle

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X24:1:Z>
Don't you think though that <,> uhm some people <,> are <,> uhm
feeling that being able to have Hong Kong return to China that you know they
use the word <,> return to the mother land uhm we will be a part a of country
again uhm is almost like <,> you know I think as as a foreigner <,> uh and
being related to <,> foreigners that in times past have common by <?> force
</?> <,> have force their presence upon uh you know the Chinese people <,>
that they  ' re <unc> one word </unc> seem to be uhm a certain attitude
<,> which would say yes it  ' s going to be good at last the foreigners are
going to go home <,> and <,> Hong Kong can again be <,> ruled by <,> uh the
Chinese people without the interference <,> of <,> foreigners

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X25:1:Z>
Do you feel that there are some people that have those kinds of
feelings as well </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#26:1:A>
Well in fact uh <,> in some occasions <,> me myself <,> think
think that way

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#27:1:A>
Uhm sometimes I will think <,> Hong Kong has been you know rule by
uh <,> British government for a long time <,,> for such a long time <,> you
know when when I was born in <,> British government <.> alre </.> already
been here for <,> more than <,> seventy years <,> of you know <,> time like
that

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#28:1:A>
So suddenly or sometimes I think <,> well now the foreigners now is
going back to their own country and <,> just as you the question you are
asking that <,> we  ' re now going back to the root <,> of you know the the the
root of us you know we are Chinese and <,> we suppose to be <,> or we are we
are originally belongs to to the mainland the big land that <,> we <,> now
don't want to don't want them

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#29:1:A>
So that <,> you know <,> just like <,> now we are <,> we are back
to like you said <,> back to the home

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#30:1:A>
Sometimes I  ' ll think that way too <,> myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#31:1:A>
Well I have been talk to people <,> uh and I don't know whether <,>
many people would think that way <,> because <,> maybe <,> uh they will this
this concept or this feeling will <,> make people even more positive <,>
approaching ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#32:1:A>
Uh <,> but <,> I guess <.> mo </.> most of the <,> people that I
mention <,> have positive uhm <,> perception about approaching ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#33:1:A>
We think that way too <,> because uhm <,> uh many <,> social worker
or or people uh who would who do the research on young people <,> and they  ' ll
think <,> <unc> one word </unc> many people <,> doesn't have the
concept of <,> the root <{1> <[1> <,> of </[1> of of you know of their <,>
identity <,> and they  ' ll because <,> Hong Kong have been <,> you know <,>
rule by the British government for too long <,> and <,> like uh it  ' s a very
funny questions when <,> when foreigner <,> came to Hong Kong and try to <,>
buy a <,> souvenir <,> to represent Hong Kong <&> tut </&> uh almost <,> no
body can find a <,> really <,> special thing that you can buy in Hong Kong to
represent Hong Kong when they go back to their country like this well <,>
well like if if I go to Japan I  ' ll buy a a little doll <,> it looks <,>
everybody look at the doll <,> would will know that well you have been <,> to
Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#34:1:A>
But for for the foreigner from America or from different country
when they come to Hong Kong <,> they couldn't buy something back to the
country <,> to show that they have been Hong Kong because there  ' s nothing
<,> special about Hong Kong <,> because is just a place <,> that uhm you know
<,> consist of different country <,> I mean different people from different
country

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#35:1:A>
And they work there they had they do the trading they do the <,>
you know do the work there

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#36:1:A>
But if all the people go back to their own country <,> and all the
Hong Kong people is <,> is left over there <,> they don't have their identity
<,> because they live according or they depends on <,> all the trading <,>
all the business happen here

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#37:1:A>
So they don't <,> many young people <,> don't have the concept or
they don't have a <,> sense of <.> belon </.> <.> longing </.> to <,> you
know <,> <{2> <[2> their </[2> country

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X38:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X39:1:Z>
<[2> <unc> one words </unc> </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X40:1:Z>
Well I think <,> that probably is because the <,,> current
population has all been born under the <,> you know rule of the <,> British
so <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> from the very earliest <,> memories that you would
have all you can think about is what <,> it is like to live in a <,> uh
territory that is <,> uhm under the rule of of you know foreign country half
way around <,> the world

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X41:1:Z>
I think though <,> you know it  ' s interesting to me that <,> a
hundred and year a hundred years ago or more <,> when uh Hong Kong uh by
force was taken and made in two uh uh uh <,> a protector of the British <,>
that at that point China <,> was guarding itself against anything it was
Western

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X42:1:Z>
You know they did not want any of the influences that were coming
from the West <,> and it it does seem at that time that the influences were
almost <unc> one word </unc> negative <,> you know the selling of
opium and that <{2> <[2> of </[2> thing

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X43:1:Z>
But <,> now at at this present time <,> if you go across the
boarder <,> uh they are doing everything they can they can do attract the
foreigners to come <,> because they have realized the value of uhm modern
management methods <,> uh high technology <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> uh many of
these things that have uh been in the West for a long time now now China is
inviting those <,> those foreign influences <,> uhm to come

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X44:1:Z>
And I think that <,> the world will be watching Hong Kong <,>
because if <,> you look at the history of the British <,> where in times pass
they have had their colonies and then they have uh withdrawn many times the
<,> organizational skills uh the system of law <,> and some of the other
things that the British have been able to introduce that were very positive
things for the country uhm begin to go backward especially <,> you know I can
think of many other places in Africa <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> where the British
before had established uhm very well run organized systems that after they
withdrew <,> their system begin to breakdown <,> uh <unc> one word
</unc> some of the <,> nationals then wish that the British <,> had <,>
never left

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X45:1:Z>
Do you think that in Hong Kong that the Chinese can govern
themselves better than the British <,> have been able to govern them </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#46:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#47:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#48:1:A>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#49:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#50:1:A>
It  ' s not easy to say <,> that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#51:1:A>
I I just thought <,> think of uh <,> uhm a feeling of many Hong <,>
many Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#52:1:A>
Just like uh when you mention uh that what happen in <,> in Africa
many part of Africa <,> that <,> now Hong Kong people <,> <?> who who </?>
will be staying in Hong Kong <,> is worrying about many thing <,> and most of
the things that <,> like like <,> like you said <,> British government uh in
fact has brought you know many good things to Hong Kong <,> and it has a
development of economy <,> you know the development of the city <,> and all
the law system seems to be very <,> you know <,> very good and and <,> people
are happy about <,> the even the the law of the British government

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#53:1:A>
But then suddenly <,> people realize that you know the law system
has to be changed <,> to a system which <,> they don't find very reliable

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#54:1:A>
You know <,> when we heard about you know some some uh thing happen
in China <,> uhm recently that you know make Hong Kong people very frighten
<,> about the law system over there <,> and it seems that <,> you know even a
<,> even a <,> person who has hasn't commit any crime <,> or who is not
guilty <,> would find <,> would be found guilty

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#55:1:A>
Because <,> you know they don't have a very <,> good system <,> law
system

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#56:1:A>
You know <,> <.> s </.> this is one of the example that make many
Hong Hong Kong people <,> uh frighten now <,> or or they worry about and <,>
and they don't they want to do something you know to make <,> the Chinese uh
law system <,> even similar to the British one so that they won't be afraid
<,> when after ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#57:1:A>
So <,> it  ' s quite <,> complicated now for people who will be
staying in Hong Kong <,> uh approaching ninety seven

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#58:1:A>
Uhm you know <,> just like you mention the history of Hong Kong <,>
that <,> at the very beginning <,> British government bring the <,> evil
things in into Hong Kong <,> selling opium and bringing all the corruptions

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#59:1:A>
And then suddenly <,> when ninety seven is approaching they found
that <,> British government has does <,> many things good <,> you know <,>
even <,> can overcome all the bad things they have done

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#60:1:A>
And now <,> the good British government <,> has <,> to be going <,>
leaving Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#61:1:A>
And then <,> you know it  ' s it  ' s very <,> interesting you know for
for the situation <,> for for many young I mean for many Hong Kong people now

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X62:1:Z>
I would I was with uhm an older man the other day <,> and we were
discussing these kinds of events and he <,> uh was quite angry because <,,>
he said the uhm British have a voice <,> and <,> the Chinese government has a
voice <,> and the British and Beijing <,> are going back and forth about many
different things concerning Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X63:1:Z>
But he felt like the Hong Kong people had been left out <&>

$A laughs </&> <,> that they did not have the ability to <,> help determine
<,> their <,> own future that their future was being determine by Britain and
by uhm the leaders in Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X64:1:Z>
Do you feel that way or do you feel like that Hong Kong people had
been given a voice </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#65:1:A>
You you you would <,> you make me to recall us <,> popular
song in Hong Kong <,> uh <,> <.> s </.> by by a <,> pop music group

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#66:1:A>
The topic is <,> the main topic is about the same <,> that uhm <,>
yeah he use a <,> uh what we call a <,,> <&> tut </&> <,> paradigm

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#67:1:A>
Use a paradigm to represent the situation that <,> there is a
father arguing with the mother <,> and left the kids behind <,> the mother
and the father is <,> uh arguing something about the kid but <,> in fact <,>
the problem or the needs of the kids has been left out

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#68:1:A>
So the kid shout out to the parent and said <,> father please go
and mother please shut up because <,> I have to say something

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#69:1:A>
You know this is the <,> the the message of the song

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#70:1:A>
So <unc> one word </unc> some people will will think that
way really because <,> uh many many <,> uhm <,> I don't know <,> the the term
for that there is uh <,> some people <,> uh they will they will think that
<,> when the British government arguing with the <,> the Beijing government
<,> they don't they are not really <,> uh concern about the the needs of the
Hong Kong people

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#71:1:A>
They just <,> uh arguing according <,> to what what they <,> will
need <?> that </?> I mean the needs of the own government only <,> or because
of the <,> politics <,> problem <,> because they are <.> poli </.> politician
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#72:1:A>
So <,,> <.> s </.> well <,> many people I mean <,> some people will
will will have this feeling <,> really and <,> that  ' s why <,> the election
seems to be very important <,> now in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#73:1:A>
<{2> <[2> The free </[2> election

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X74:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X75:1:Z>
<[2> So they can <,> </[2> </{2> have a voice </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#76:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#77:1:A>
And they can <,> had have a chance even <,> to <,> uh to talk I
mean to voice out their own needs <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#78:1:A>
So <&> long pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X79:1:Z>
Well you know another question I had or thought concerns the fact
that <,> after Margaret Thatcher had come and they had worked out the Joint
Declaration <,> uhm it seems like a principle at that time they had decided
that there would be what they call the through train <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> that
there would be elections that would <,> elect uhm a group of leaders that
would straddle <,> the <,> year nineteen ninety seven so that there wouldn't
be a drastic change in nineteen ninety seven but that there would be <,>
leadership elected <,> several years before ninety years that would continue
to serve their term <,> across the ninety seven day and into the new SAR
government <,> so that it would be a smooth transition

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X80:1:Z>
But obviously that has all broken down <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and we
heard last week that in fact uh the Chinese government was going to dismantle
the current <,> uh legislator and the current political would all be
dismantled <,> and they would start <,> over again

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#X81:1:Z>
What what you think about <,> this </X> <&> long pause </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-073#82:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#83:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#84:1:A>
Well <,,> <unc> two words </unc> when when Margaret
Thatcher was in Hong Kong no was in Beijing <,> uhm you know <,> I was quite
small <,> quite young <,> and <,> I didn't think about politics <,> or <,>
the future of Hong Kong uh that at that time

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#85:1:A>
But when when the time comes to you know <,> now today <,> I
thought that <,> uhm it  ' s always the <,> the way of uh <,> administration of
<.> Chin </.> China government <,> always because <,> uhm <,> you know China
government always express uh uhm <,> an identity or or or <unc> one word
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#86:1:A>
They want to be very outstanding <,> in their culture in the way of
handling <,> the whole country <,> and they still want to <,> keep the uhm
<,> the country in a communist country

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#87:1:A>
They thought this is the best way to <,> you know to run the
country

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#88:1:A>
So <,> uh I don't know who start the <,> that start the uh the
treaty or or the signing of the treaty uh at that time by Margaret Thatcher

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#89:1:A>
So <,> you know <,> I don't really know <,> what what should I <,>
comment on on this but <,,> sometimes I  ' ll feel uh depress about <,> the <,>
you know the <,> the ruler of the China government <,> or the <,> the top <,>
person of the China government because <,> it seems that <,> they won't <,>
do what they promise <,> usually <,> or for most of the time <&>

$Z laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#90:1:A>
And even for the <,> for any citizen in China uh <,> it they work
or they do or they behave in the same way

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#91:1:A>
Sometimes they  ' ll promise something <,> and then <,> they won't
<,> they I mean they won't do what they promise

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#92:1:A>
For examples like when you buy a property in China now <,> it it  ' s
possible that you won't get the <,> the property or even the <,> what they
promise on <,> how big is the property or or what we will be supplying to the
property and <,,> even up to fifty percent <,> you don't have that <,> or you
won't get that even you have paid the money

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#93:1:A>
<unc> One word </unc> that  ' s the way that <,> the country
goes <,> you know <,> it seems that the whole country had the has have the
way to to uh deal with the people

<ICE-HK:S1A-073#94:1:A>
