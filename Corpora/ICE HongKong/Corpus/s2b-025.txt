It has been suggested that Hong Kong  ' s five percent growth rate to this year is very healthy by the standard of developed economies

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#2:1:A>
And that the three point five percent unemployment rate is low by normal international standards

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#3:1:A>
The implication is that Hong Kong  ' s economy is still in good shape and that the problem posed by the rising ranks of the jobless should not be exaggerated

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#4:1:A>
The truth is <,> those who travel on the Sau Ki Wan minibus know very different <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#5:1:A>
No one should take for granted the plight of <,> one hundred and ten thousand men and women who are currently out of work and that of the families that they support or help support

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#6:1:A>
Ours is a flourish or perish society where negative social values are attached to joblessness

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#7:1:A>
The absence of the employment insurance also means that those who lost their jobs may also face difficulties in making ends meet <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#8:1:A>
The record number of unemployed itself bespeaks the poor state of the economy regardless of what optimists would like us believe

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#9:1:A>
Although Hong Kong has in the recent issue of Fortune magazine been named the third most competitive economy and in an earlier issue of the same magazine was named one of the ten best cities in the world to do business there is a dearth of substantial new investment in the territory

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#10:1:A>
Our industry has during the past decade and a half by and large relocated to the Pearl River Delta and other parts of China as well as countries like Thailand the Philippines and Vietnam

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#11:1:A>
Given the low value added nature of our industries that is the only way to survive

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#12:1:A>
Unlike the other little Tigers of Asia we have not developed a high tech industry because our government has done nothing to attract or encourage such industry

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#13:1:A>
Taiwan has its Acer and Vtec

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#14:1:A>
Korea has its lucky Goldstar and Samsung

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#15:1:A>
Singapore is host to many multinational technology leaders

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#16:1:A>
What does Hong Kong have

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#17:1:A>
Some in Hong Kong believe that our only future lies in services

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#18:1:A>
We are no doubt proud of our position as Asia  ' s pre-eminent financial trading and transportation center

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#19:1:A>
The strength of a service economy lies in its human resources

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#20:1:A>
Look at the poor state of education system

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#21:1:A>
A lot of employers are disappointed by the standard of the products of our schools and universities both in terms of the general knowledge as well as the language skills

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#22:1:A>
There are deep-seated factors which lead to the present state of affairs and I look forward to the opportunity of elaborating on these on a future Letter

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#23:1:A>
The meritocratic ethos which has been the cornerstone of our success as well as that of our main competitors has now been replaced by a tolerance <?> on </?> mediocrity

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#24:1:A>
Emphasis on quality has been looked upon as elitist as arrogant as unbecoming of a democratic society

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#25:1:A>
This erroneous concept and unhealthy trend must be reversed or else we shall before too long find ourselves in the tragic comic state of a society of <.> mm </.> mediocres pretending to provide world class service

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#26:1:A>
If we cannot provide <,> world class service we cannot compete as an international service center <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#27:1:A>
So where does our future lie

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#28:1:A>
In services in high tech industry as an entreport or as a postcolonial society lost in the abyss between two cultures

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#29:1:A>
I believe the answer must be that we must continue to be a leading international financial trading transportation and service center

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#30:1:A>
We must develop a new industrial base built on selected high technologies

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#31:1:A>
We must exploit to the full our position as the gateway to China

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#32:1:A>
And we must strive to be truly bi-cultural society with the  sophistication and language skills that the description demands

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#33:1:A>
In finding where our future lies it would also be necessary to know where we fit in in terms of China  ' s overall development strategy

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#34:1:A>
Will Shanghai be a competing financial center

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#35:1:A>
Will the many ports being built in China affect our position as the world  ' s leading container port

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#36:1:A>
Will China develop its own high tech industrial base close by Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#37:1:A>
These we need to know and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance of which I am chairman will take as a priority task to find out not only from the Central government of China but also from the leaders of areas like Guangdong Shanghai and Fujan where we have many contacts

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#38:1:A>
The immediate task that the Hong Kong government now faces will be to stimulate the economy and to attract investment

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#39:1:A>
Unemployment can only be tackled by creating more jobs and not by measures which affect the competitiveness of our economy such as across the board banning of the importation of workers

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#40:1:A>
A less competitive Hong Kong would see more business failures and the loss of still more jobs

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#41:1:A>
A <?> LegCo and </?> government which tried to take the easy way out by shooting scapegoats will be grossly irresponsible <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#42:1:A>
I have therefore recently in LegCo asked the government to consider setting up an Economic Development Board

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#43:1:A>
The Board would comprise leading businessmen and professionals and be organized along the lines of the Trade Development Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#44:1:A>
Its function would be to make recommendations to the government on issues relating to economic development to attract foreign investment human resources and technology to Hong Kong and to collect economic and business data from global sources

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#45:1:A>
Much of its work will be done through overseas offices to be established in leading international cities perhaps in the same premises as those of the Trade Development Council

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#46:1:A>
Singapore  ' s Economic Development Board has served Singapore well

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#47:1:A>
And I believe it is high time that Hong Kong catches up in making a conscious effort in attracting foreign capital and other factors of production

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#48:1:A>
Nothing <,> nowadays come without hard work </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-025#49:2:A>
A recent economic and political survey <,> done by Survey Research Hong Kong <,> conveys a message that public confidence in the economy has continued its downward trend <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#50:2:A>
It is <?> hardly </?> a surprise to me when people know that our employment rate is at a ten year high <,> and at least hundred and five thousand of Hong Kong  ' s three million strong labour force are not working <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#51:2:A>
With the knowledge that the government has no major safety net program available for them I believe it is indeed a big problem needs to be tackled immediately <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#52:2:A>
I am greatly disappointed <?> that </?> the governor  ' s speech <,> this year failed to address the most important crisis we are now facing <,> that is measures to boost the waning economy <,> to curb inflation <,> and to improve the unemployment situation

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#53:2:A>
I wonder if this is really the philosophy of a sunset government that no initiative can be expected from it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#54:2:A>
The downward forecast of our economic growth rate worries me the most <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#55:2:A>
The government decrease the nineteen ninety five estimated GDP growth to five percent in real terms from five and a half percent forecast at the beginning of the year

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#56:2:A>
The point is <,> that our GDP gross <,> was at five point nine percent

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#57:2:A>
In the first quarter <,> while the government readjusted average growth rate to five percent which means that our economic performance in the fourth quarter will be down to four and <?> a </?> half percent or lower <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#58:2:A>
This is a very steep decrease

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#59:2:A>
This is a major problem that the trend is worrying

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#60:2:A>
The disappointment is <,> the governor said nothing to stimulate the economy and he thinks there is no problem <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#61:2:A>
I believe the success of Hong Kong has been founded on the respect for individual freedom <,> free trade low tax and minimum <.> governmen </.> government intervention

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#62:2:A>
Hong Kong people has the reputation of being diligent <,> and willing to take on new challenges in a fast changing society

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#63:2:A>
Our current unemployment problem largely stemmed from restructuring of our economy which create a big gap between workers availability and job vacancies <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#64:2:A>
Thus some tailor-made and on the job training and re-training program for the workers should be organized in order to equip the workers with the necessary skills for new employment <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#65:2:A>
The government should organize more re-training courses to meet the market demand

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#66:2:A>
This is a much more positive attitude towards the unemployment problem

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#67:2:A>
Our economy cannot be restored <,> only with skilled workers <,> we also need investors whose business can provide job opportunities for our labour force <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#68:2:A>
In order to make Hong Kong maintaining its status as a favourable place for investors <,> the Liberal Party proposes the government should lower its current salaries and profits tax by one and a half percent <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#69:2:A>
A more lenient tax system can encourage income <?> owners </?> and investors to spend more thus bring recovery of trade <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#70:2:A>
The cycle goes on and the economy will be boosted

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#71:2:A>
I  ' m grateful to my LegCo colleagues

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#72:2:A>
We got together last week at the House Committee and agreed to freeze twelve of government  ' s charges for the year

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#73:2:A>
I believe this is the right decision for Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#74:2:A>
With government holding over four hundred and fifty billion dollars in exchange fund and a hundred <?> and </?> fifty billion dollars in reserve plus over one hundred billion dollars for SAR government in the land fund <,> I do not see any reason why government needs money

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#75:2:A>
It is time to take measures to lower inflation <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#76:2:A>
Legislators are not <.> embedding </.> abandoning the User Pay principle

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#77:2:A>
At least I  ' m not

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#78:2:A>
This is <?> the </?> only interim measure <,> made by the legislators who understand the economic problem <,> that we are facing today and to take measures which government is not willing to take <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#79:2:A>
In nineteen ninety one <,> government did same thing to curb inflation by freezing fees and charges

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#80:2:A>
Today we have a much stronger reserve

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#81:2:A>
They cannot explain to the people of Hong Kong why they need more money

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#82:2:A>
A government is not a business

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#83:2:A>
It is not government business to make money

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#84:2:A>
There are many other ways to boost the <?> sorry </?> economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#85:2:A>
The Liberal Party believes the government should also relax the seventy percent mortgage <?> scheme </?> <,> which will bring more buyers in especially first time home buyers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#86:2:A>
Moreover <,> more jobs will be provided should the government speed up the building of the infrastructure <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#87:2:A>
Projects <.> suc </.> such as country park session of <?> Route Three </?> and the NorthWest Railway

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#88:2:A>
To build more public housing and to sell it to those who wants to buy

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#89:2:A>
All of these are measures that the government can take to provide more job opportunities and to turn our economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#90:2:A>
In brief <,> I believe <,> we LegCo members have made the right decision to freeze government charges

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#91:2:A>
It is not only beneficial to the ordinary citizen but it also has the effect of suppressing inflation rate

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#92:2:A>
By equip our labour force to cope with the ever-changing world and by encouraging investors to Hong Kong we will get through this hard period together and enter a prosperous twenty first century

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#93:2:A>
Another controversial topic provoking big echoes from the community is the policy speech is the sudden and made a sudden <?> U-turn </?> that the government by the government on the importation of labour

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#94:2:A>
No one will dispute the unemloyment rate is <?> at </?> a serious problem for Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#95:2:A>
However <,> a cut on quota on imported labour from twenty five thousand to five thousand <,> can only make <?> it </?> difficult for business to employ people with expertise which can hardly be found in the local market

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#96:2:A>
I do not understand the rationale behind this proposal

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#97:2:A>
As <.> hi </.> I have explained before the fundamental way to tackle unemployment is plainly by providing more jobs <,> not by arguing how many imported labour should be allowed working in Hong Kong <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#98:2:A>
If for any reason <,> we should restrict the number of in-coming workers the government should first strictly enforce the law to fight against illegal workers <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#99:2:A>
It is estimated there are about a hundred and fifty thousand illegal workers in the territory

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#100:2:A>
So far we are not doing much to curb illegal workers

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#101:2:A>
Lastly I would like to comment on the controversial suggestion of the legal sub-group of the <.> pre </.> Preliminary Working Committee on the Bill of Rights

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#102:2:A>
My initial reaction is <,> why PWC want to propose to tackle the Bill of Rights

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#103:2:A>
The law was enacted on June fifth nineteen ninety one

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#104:2:A>
Many PWC members were legislators then <,> and supported the Bill

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#105:2:A>
The laws of Hong Kong are amended upon the need of the current situation

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#106:2:A>
The Bill of Rights was passed in nineteen ninety one and has been implemented in Hong Kong without major problems

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#107:2:A>
Hong Kong people are quite accustomed with such changes and the society is functioning well

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#108:2:A>
I do not see <.> ther </.> there is any urgency to restore the six laws mentioned by the legal sub-group

<ICE-HK:S2B-025#109:2:A>
If in the future <,> the legislative council of the SAR finds problems mentioning by PWC  ' s legal sub-group the <?> bare </?> legislature </I>
