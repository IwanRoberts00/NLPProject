<h> <ul> History of Bach  ' s organ music </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#3:1>
<p> J.S. Bach &obrack; 1685-1750 &cbrack; is the apex of organ study .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#4:1>
His artistic contribution to organ literature is very great .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#5:1>
Most of his organ works can be found in two of his major periods : the
earliest years and Weimar period &obrack; 1695-1717 &cbrack; , totalling
twenty-two years , during which a large portion of the organ works , such as
the chorale-based works and free organ works , were written &semi; the Cothen
period &obrack; 1717-1723 &cbrack; , six years principally devoted to the
production of secular instrumental compositions not involving the organ
although the Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor was created in this period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#6:1>
The Leipzig period of twenty-seven years &obrack; 1723-1750 &cbrack; ,
during which the mature organ works were made . </p>

<h> <ul> The role of Bach  ' s organ music in his time </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#9:1>
<p> Of Bach  ' s organ works in his early period , the most prominent are the
chorale preludes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#10:1>
These works constitute a continuation of the North German School and
also form the grand closing statement for that school . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#11:1>
<p> Samuel Scheidt , as early as 1624 , established the technical
possibilities and artistic foundations of the chorale prelude &semi; he
indicated that the melody of the chorale could be placed in any voice part
and that even double pedaling could be accomplished at the organ .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#12:1>
Pachelbel &obrack; 1653-1706 &cbrack; contributed the chorale fugue ,
a fugal treatment of phrases of the chorale melody .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#13:1>
Bohm &obrack; 1661-1733 &cbrack; expressed the chorale melody in
luxuriant coloratura settings .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#14:1>
Buxtehude &obrack; 1637-1707 &cbrack; treated the chorale melody in
both easy and complex ways &semi; sometimes the melody is stated very simply
with only slight ornamentation , sometimes he expressed the chorale melody
rhapsodically in fantasias . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#15:1>


<p> Bach is the one who took the methods of treatment worked out by earlier
masters and infused greater imagination and color into them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#16:1>
He raised the forms and the organ literature to a greater height .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#17:1>
<p> In his Weimar period , Bach paid much attention to the virtuoso style of
the North German school and expressed it in brilliant toccata passages for
manuals , long pedal solos , many different kinds of figuration , massive
chords , dramatic pedal points , and improvisational and recitative sections
&obrack; for example , the Prelude and Fugue in A minor , BWV 543 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#18:1>
Another <-> prominant </-> <+> prominent </+> element was drawn from
Italian instrumental works : the concertato &obrack; orchestral &cbrack;
style , in which there is marked contrast between thin and thick textures .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#19:1>
In addition , many of Bach  ' s themes built on broken chords suggest
the Italian violinistic style of Vivaldi and Corelli . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#20:1>


<p> Toward the Leipzig period , Bach  ' s preludes and fugues became more
independent of each other .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#21:1>
Each part became longer , and both parts tended to treat the subject
material contrapuntally throughout and concentrated on one or two motives in
a consistent manner .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#22:1>
A significant number of the later fugues can be classified in the
<fnr> 6 </fnr> < ? > ricecar </ ? > type in which the subjects are composed
of notes of longer duration and a much less marked rhythm than the subjects
of earlier fugues .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#23:1>
Virtuoso pedal passages and concertato treatment does recur from time
to time in later preludes and <-> fugres </-> <+> fugues </+> but to a much
smaller degree than that found in the Weimar period . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#24:1>
<h> <ul> History of organ performance </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#25:1>
<p> After Bach , the doctrine of organ music  ' s performance practices were
not awared until Mendelssohn appeared as a defender of organ playing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#26:1>
For example , the Henle Edition and the Lea Pocket Scores both
provide a faithful edition of Mendelssohn  ' s organ works in which Mendelssohn  ' s
organ works in which Mendelssohn made clear shurs which require the
interpreter to give a real sense of articulated musical sentences on a
mechanical action keyboard such as the Gottfried Silbermann organ in St.
Georgen Church , Rotha .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#27:1>
This movement established an idea of the close relationship between
articulation , style of performance and the instrument itself .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#28:1>
As an enthusiast of the music of Bach , Mendelssohn also performed
Bach  ' s organ works frequently in recital .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#29:1>
Mendelssohn  ' s organ playing and interest in organ music helped to
establish a new conception of organ building and of the interpretation of
organ music . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#30:1>
<p> Besides Mendelssohn in Germany , Samuel Wesley in England who contribute
the revival of interest in Bach  ' s organ music <+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#31:1>
</+> </p> 

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#32:1>
<p> Samuel Wesley &obrack; 1766-1837 &cbrack; , was a brilliant English organ
performer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#33:1>
Samuel Wesley admired Bach intensely and worked to introduce Bach  ' s
music to the English people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#34:1>
He published several English editions of Bach  ' s works . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#35:1>
<p> However , in general , the art of performing early music such as that of
Buxtehude or even Bach was almost lost as attention was given to Romantic
practices and invention .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#36:1>
Knowledge of Baroque ornaments and registration was largely lost as a
result , both the triumph of Romantic <-> muisc </-> <+> music </+> and of an
attitude which gave little or no attention to &ldquo; period &rdquo; style .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#37:1>


<p> Because of different paths in the evolution of performance , taking place
in different regions such as Germany , France , Australia , Italy and Britain
, the performance of Bach  ' s organ works was also subject to this evolution ,
as organists tended to play Bach  ' s works &ldquo; in their own manner &rdquo;
which was very close to their individual school . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#38:1>


<p> Therefore , the evolution of organ performance varied according to
different countries , traditions and schools of playing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#39:1>
The old German school recommended a solemn legato with standardized
duration of note values while the French School in the nineteenth century
recommended an exaggerated articulation ignoring accents and strong beats .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#40:1>
Some people even tried to adjust the old music to the <foreign>
&ldquo; <-> novelle </-> <+> < ? > nouvelle </ ? > </+> mode &rdquo;
</foreign> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#41:1>
Some performers even thought of reorchestration the fugues of Bach
and added a lot of registration , manual changes and varieties of pedal in
order to fully utilize the newly-invented organs of the period and , in a
sense , bring Bach  ' s organ music into the &ldquo; highest realms &rdquo;
&obrack; meaning , of course , the current fashion &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#42:1>
French Romantic organists such as Cesar Franck &obrack; 1822-1890
&cbrack; and Charles-Marie Widor &obrack; 1844-1837 &cbrack; , contributors
to the development of organ music and to the extension of organ forms and
registration , had an influence on this style of playing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#43:1>
The whole period of the nineteenth century was not favourable to
careful research and consideration of Bach  ' s organ works .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#44:1>
Starting from the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries
concern for &ldquo; authenticity &rdquo; and respect for the composer  ' s
intentions came into <-> provinence </-> <+> < ? > prominence </ ? > </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#45:1>
Only in the second half of the twentieth century was a clear idea of
Bach  ' s organ interpretation established . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#47:1>
<h> <ul> Historical reasons on problems of the interpretation of Bach  ' s
organ music </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#48:1>
<p> The late twentieth century has developed a fashion for applying the term
&ldquo; authenticity &rdquo; with regard to performance of Baroque music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#49:1>
This is the idea of trying to make the performance closer to the
music as heard during the Baroque period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#50:1>
But how is one to achieve this aim ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#51:1>
Many musicians and musicologists believe that the historical &ldquo;
authenticity &rdquo; should possess a foundation for the &ldquo; honest
&rdquo; or &ldquo; loyal &rdquo; interpretation of a work . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#52:1>
<p> As Bach never made detailed notations <fnr> 7 </fnr> regarding
registration , articulation and phrasing , problems arise among scholars and
performers concerned with authenticity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#53:1>
His flexible reticence creates a never-ending mystery .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#54:1>
A larger problem is that Bach  ' s organ music has a mixture of
influences which makes it difficult to decide which style is the preference
of Bach and what interpretation is most appropriate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#55:1>
Should one take into consideration only French influences &obrack;
Galant and Romantic organ and its registration &cbrack; , or those of the
North German School , with the authentic organs of Bach  ' s time and the
registration of Bach  ' s period &semi; or even English influences , all of
which are present in the music ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#56:1>
<p> A number of recent scholars have collected research amassed over the
years by a variety of scholars .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#57:1>
Thus , present-day scholars and performers can save time and effort
by making use of the fruits of their labours .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#58:1>
Examples are books and articles by <fnr> 8 </fnr> Hermann Keller ,
<fnr> 9 </fnr> Frederich Neumann , J . Klopper , <fnr> 10 </fnr> Peter
Williams , <fnr> 11 </fnr> Marie Claire Alain .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#59:1>
All those researches have received the acceptance of the majority of
organists , especially the English organists &obrack; perhaps because the
consistent , steady and securely based on the research of their scholars
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#60:1>
All the books and manuscripts become the foundation of interpretation .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#61:1>
<p> According to Bach  ' s pupil <fnr> 12 </fnr> Johann Christian Kittel , Bach
often used his own works for the repertoire of organ lessons .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#62:1>
Bach frequently changed the notations , phrasing , pedalling and
ornaments and altered the music during the lessons whenever he thought it was
unsatisfactory . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#63:1>
<p> <fnr> 13 </fnr> In C.P.E. Bach  ' s letter to Johann Nikolaus Forkel ,
the first biographer of Bach , dated on 13 January 1775 , he writes , <quote>
&ldquo; Bach composed his keyboard works in two ways . <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#X64:1>
The first was to improvise at the keyboard and later <-> se </-> <+>
set </+> the piece down on paper . . . . . organists were often terrified
when he sat down to play on their organs and drew the stops in his own manner . 
&rdquo; </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#65:1>
<p> The phrase <mention> &ldquo; in his own manner &rdquo; </mention> seems
to cut Bach off from the common practice of his period .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#66:1>
Therefore , Bach was never thought of as a &ldquo; typical &rdquo;
eighteenth century organ composer either in his own time or even in the
nineteenth century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#67:1>
It was not until the nineteenth century that different editions were
published , and scholars made the studies that produced further questions
regarding Bach  ' s organ performance practices .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#68:1>
Examples are the Peters editor Friedrich Conrad Griepenkerl , and
Albert Schweitzer  ' s romantic advocacy in the late nineteenth century and the
early twentieth century . </p>

<p> Schools of interpretation style in organ <-> performaces </-> <+>performances </+>
leads to another page of directions of organ playing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#71:1>
There are much concern on &ldquo; style &rdquo; and the appropriate
interpretation of Baroque organ works . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#72:1>
<p> Generally , there are two pressing style in the late nineteenth century
and the early twentieth .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#73:1>
The Romantic School in the late nineteenth century is very free .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#74:1>
They are free that they use more rubato , articulation , and legato
phrasing than the organists of other schools .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#75:1>
They think that the interpretation of Bach  ' s organ music should be
varied , as it is going towards the twentieth century .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#76:1>
Another School is the old German school , which is the continuation
of the North German school from which Bach  ' s music originated <-> &cbrack;
</-> <+> . </+>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#77:1>
They try their best to fit their interpretation into Bach  ' s
originality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#78:1>
They bring in some detached , breathing points to achieve the clarity
of each line &obrack; the counterpoint &cbrack; and play the music with
stricted timing . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#79:1>
<p> Starting from the end of nineteenth-century , organ performers have been
trying to find a way of an appropriate performance <+> . </+> </p>

<h> <ul> GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE ORGAN  ' s INTERPRETATION IN THE SECOND
HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#82:1>
<p> Previously organists of the past centuries have tended to ignore
performance practices in other field of music , but with the growing &ldquo;
cross-fertilization &rdquo; between musical disciplines , organ performances
is now more strongly influenced by performance conventions in other fields of
music than has ever been the case since , indeed , the time of Bach - the
last major period of musical history when organists were also expected to be
involved in orchestral and choral music making .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#83:1>
Along with the rise of the &ldquo; authentic &rdquo; performance
movement in fields other than organ music , the vocal and string-playing
techniques has influenced modernday interpreters of Bach  ' s organ music in a
way that has not been the case in the past . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#84:1>
<p> In addition , as far as authenticity is concerned , in recent years ,
many organists have tried to make their interpretations &ldquo; authentic
&rdquo; with regard to the old German Baroque , in so far as they eliminate a
lot of possibilities of registration which today  ' s organ can achieve &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#85:1>
organists imitate what they know of the common performance practices
of Bach  ' s time and try to play very close to the style that Bach is supposed
to have done .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#86:1>
This kind of interpretation , can be , in uninspired hands ,
sometimes quite monotonous since there is often no creativity and thought
even the performances can be justified by some written historical assessment .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#87:1>
<p> However , most significance of all , the French influences in the
performance of Bach is being concerned again after a period of being
forgotten .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#88:1>
It is known that Bach was influenced by the French Classical composer
&obrack; Couperin , Clerambault , etc. &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#89:1>
Indeed the music of this period had been all forgotten until the
second world war &obrack; 1939-45 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#90:1>
Subsequently interest in it and detailed research has uncovered much
information about performance practices of the time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#91:1>
Modern Bach performers have applied these to Bach  ' s music following
the logic that <quote> &ldquo; if it was done by those who influenced Bach ,
it is reasonable to assume it was done by Bach himself &rdquo; </quote> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#92:1>
<p> Besides of the above issues , nowadays several outstanding organists have
given revolutionary and creative performances of Bach  ' s organ music .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#93:1>
Recording companies have reproduced as well the previous performances
of some earlier experienced and virtuoso organists and released collections
of Bach  ' s organ works .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#94:1>
Among these organists Helmut Wacha , Marie-Claire Alain is also a
musicologist and has produced careful and detailed researches on Bach  ' s
organ works .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#95:1>
Her performances are very appropriate , honest , modest , and in a
way , quite reserved .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#96:1>
Helmut Walcha died recently but he remains an <-> unforgetable </->
<+> unforgettable </+> organ teacher and virtuoso master of the German organ
literature .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#97:1>
In his records , now a matter of history , one finds that he tried to
incorporate some inventive ideas in the interpretation through the use of
registration , manual changes , articulation and tempo , which make him
outstanding among organists and high spirits .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#98:1>
His realisation of ornaments , his choice of registration and his
articulation are very interesting and <-> &ldquo; entaining &rdquo; </-> <+>
<?> entertaining </?> </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#99:1>
Jean Guillou  ' s interpretations provide a kind of spirit and
invigorating quality which are often absent in some other organist  ' s
interpretation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#100:1>
<fnr> 14.1 </fnr> Ton Koopman has a very animated interpretation of
Bach organ music too .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#101:1>
&obrack; both of their interpretation will be included in the next
few Chapters . &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#102:1>
His organ interpretation in Bach  ' s free works are very inventive
which probably no other organists had play in this way before .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#103:1>
However , <-> refering </-> <+> referring </+> to Koopman  ' s
background , he is an forefront authentic performer .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#104:1>
He combines the authenticity , scholarship and personal
identification and insights together . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#105:1>
<p> In an odd way , Koopman and Guillou meet in certain points , although
they are coming from different directions and background &obrack; radical and
idiosyncratic respectively &cbrack; &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#106:1>
their interpretations both turn out to be very revolutionary when
being compared with the tradition of Bach performance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#107:1>
This criterion suggests another direction in the interpretation of
Bach  ' s organ works .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#108:1>
It is that , if one is able to justify a performance by careful
thought and insights which are based within certain scholastic boundaries ,
his playing can be accepted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#109:1>
However , being too personal in interpretation may be susceptible to
criticism as a distortion of Bach  ' s intentions . </p>

<quote> <X> &ldquo; One is said to be a bad player if he doesn't
confined himself to what Bach wrote but alters it to suit his own
interpretive end . &rdquo; </X> </quote> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#112:1>
<p> Today , most organists have a pressing eagerness to find a way to
compromise between authenticity and personal insights .

<ICE-HK:W1A-009#113:1>
It is probably the aims of all organists since the past century .
