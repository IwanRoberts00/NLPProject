Local conservationists are up in arms over the approval of a
wetlands area for construction <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#71:2:A>
The developers argue they would put aside some space for nature
protection but the World Wide Fund for Nature says that  ' s not enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#72:2:A>
Jenny Lam reports

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-013#73:2:C>
The Mai Po wetlands form a most unique habitat for more than
three hundred species of birds <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#74:2:C>
In recent years their number has gone up because many are forced
out of China as Guangdong surges in industrial growth

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#75:2:C>
But their feeding ground in Hong Kong is now under threat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#76:2:C>
Num Sang Wai the wetlands area just next door to Mai Po has been
approved for development <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#77:2:C>
Conservationists say that sets a precedent for building up in the
area and leave the birds nowhere to go

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X78:2:Z>
A lot of the wildlife found around Mai Po they depend on wetlands

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X79:2:Z>
Uhm in particular there are a number of species such as the
black-faced spoonbill which is in an internationally endangered species

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X80:2:Z>
There are only three hundred and fifty left in the world <,> and
every winter we have seventy-four at Mai Po

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X81:2:Z>
And these species depend on the fishpond as a feeding habitat </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-013#82:2:C>
The developers want to turn this into a luxurious residential
district

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#83:2:C>
In return they will put aside some space for a nature reserve in
nearby <?> Lap Chau </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X84:2:Z>
The <?> Lap Chau </?> nature reserve is designed so that when the
high tide high tide comes along all the birds can have an additional high
tide <?> roof </?> and we hope that they can use and feed in Lap Chau </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-013#85:2:C>
But the conservationists argue that is not good enough <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#86:2:C>
What they want is long-term commitment to nature protection by the
government

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#87:2:C>
Both Britain and China are signatories to the Ramsar Convention
which means they are obliged to designate a wetlands area for conservation
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#88:2:C>
But environmentalists say the Hong Kong Government has no clear
policy on the protection of this kind of habitat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#89:2:C>
The Town Planning Board which approved the Num Sang Wai development
says it is working on conservation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#X90:2:Z>
The Planning Department is trying to seek funds to conduct
research about the ecology of the area and we are also looking at the need to
<unc> one-word </unc> whether there is a need to revise the
guidelines for application for development within the Mai Po Nature Reserve
Area </X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-013#91:2:C>
