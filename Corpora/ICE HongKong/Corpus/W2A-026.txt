<ICE-HK:W2A-026#3:1>
Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem in the Asia-Pacific region .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#4:1>
The acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus are major
causes of hospital admissions , blindness , renal failure , amputations ,
stroke , and coronary heart disease in this region .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#5:1>
Compared with general population , the annual per capita health care
expenditure is estimated to be four-fold for people for diabetes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#6:1>
Recent prospective studies have provided unequivocal evidence for the
crucial role of prolonged hyperglycaemia in the development of chronic
diabetic complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#7:1>
Although the aetiology of hyperglyaemia-induced damage of the kidneys
, eyes , nerves , and arteries still remains to be elucidated , observational
and inter-ventional studies show that the occurrence and progression of these
complications can be prevented by the optimal control of blood glucose ,
hypertension , and dyslipidaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#8:1>
Lifestyle changes such as weight control , increased physical exercise
, and smoking cessation are also potentially beneficial in preventing
diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#9:1>
Furthermore , the morbidity and mortality caused by diabetes mellitus
can be reduced by secondary prevention through regular screening , early
detection , and appropriate treatment of chronic complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#10:1>
Improved diabetes education is needed among health professionals as
well as the general and diabetes populations .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#11:1>
Government and public health officials should be mindful of the
economic impact of this major health problem so that adequate health care
resources can be allocated for the primary and secondary prevention of
diabetes complications . </bold> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#12:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#13:1>
There is a growing epidemic of diabetes mellitus , type 2 in
particular , in the Asia-Pacific region. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#14:1>
According to current estimates , this region has the largest diabetes
population in the world - namely , 47.3 million , which is 46&percent; of the global
burden of diabetes. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#15:1>
Population-based surveys from Asia show a wide range of prevalence
rates of diabetes mellitus: from 1.3&percent; in Vietnam to 24.2&percent; in certain India
urban communities. <sp> 3-5 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#16:1>
No doubt some of the reasons for the variability are differences in
the age range surveyed , study methodology , sampling techniques , and
criteria used to classify diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#17:1>
Nevertheless , there is a rapidly increasing trend in the prevalence
of the disease in Asian countries .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#18:1>
For example , the prevalence has increased approximately three-fold ,
from 0.8&percent; to 2.3&percent; , between 1986 and 1994 in China. <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#19:1>
More recent data from certain Chinese cities suggest this increase
may be even more pronounced , with a prevalence of as high as 9.2&percent; in Hong
Kong. <sp> 7 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#20:1>
The epidemiological transition from life-threatening infectious
disease towards more chronic conditions ,  ' westernisation ' in diet and
lifestyle practices , and effects of'thirty genes ' together probably account
for this dynamic epidemic of diabetes mellitus in Asia. <sp> 2 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#21:1>
Diabetes is a major source of morbidity , mortality , and
economic cost to society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#22:1>
Patients with diabetes are at risk of the development of acute
metabolic complications such as diabetes ketoacidosis , hyper-glycaemic
hyperosmolar nonketotic coma , and hypo-glycaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#23:1>
They are also at risk of experiencing chronic complications such as
atherosclerotic diseases , retin-opathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , and foot
ulceration , as well as other general medical conditions unrelated to the
acute or chronic complications specific to diabetes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#24:1>
It has been estimated that the annual per capita health care
expenditure in the United States in 1997 was four-fold for people with
diabetes when compared with the general population. <sp> 8 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#25:1>
This article reviews the chronic complications of diabetes
mellitus and considers the scientific basis , clinical care , economic impact
, and public health implications of these co-morbidities on patients ,
doctors , and health care organizations in Asia . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#26:1>
The glucose hypothesis </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#27:1>
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterised by
hyperglycaemia and alterations in fat and protein metabolism , and the
occurrence of a specific set of chronic complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#28:1>
The plasma glucose cut-off levels for diagnosing diabetes mellitus
rest firmly in their association with diabetes complications such as
retinopathy. <sp> 9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#29:1>
The tactic recognition of the close relationship between
hyperglycaemia and chronic complications has le to the  ' glucose hypothesis',
<sp> 10,11 </sp> which proposes that hyperglycaemia is directly , or
indirectly , related to the development or progression , or both , of
diabetes complications , including the microvascular conditions of
retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy. <sp> 12 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#30:1>
For macrovascular or atherosclerotic complications of diabetes
mellitus , a subanalysis of the Framingham Heart Study cohort has
demonstrated a clear dose-response association between glycated hemoglobin
levels and the prevalence of cardio-vascular disease. <sp> 13 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#31:1>
In addition , recent interventional studies in patients with type 1
<sp> 14 </sp> and type 2 <sp> 15 </sp> diabetes mellitus have provided strong
support for the glucose hypothesis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#32:1>
In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial &obrack;  DCCT &cbrack; , intensive
therapy reduced the development and progression of all complications by
approximately 50&percent;. <sp> 14 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#33:1>
This uniform salutary effect or retinopathy , nephropathy , and
neuropathy further suggests that hyperglycaemia may play a similar role in
the pathogenesis of these complications. <sp> 11 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#34:1>
Exactly what the pathogenetic mechanism is and how it works are
still unanswered questions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#35:1>
Traditionally , there have been two major putative pathways: the
aldose reductase - sorbitol and the glycation models .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#36:1>
Results of animal studies support the former model , but results from
human studies have been less convincing. <sp> 16-18 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#37:1>
The efficacy of a potent protein glycation inhibitor was reported in
a diabetic animal model in 1986, <sp> 19 </sp> but its effectiveness remains
to be proven in an ongoing human clinical trial .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#38:1>
A third pathway by which hyperglycaemia may cause long-term vascular
complications , has recently been described. <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#39:1>
This model suggests that the activation of the ß <sb> 2 </sb> -
isoform of protein kinase C in vascular tissue is a key step in the cascade
of events through which glucose triggers diabetic complications. <sp> 10,20
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#40:1>
The available evidence indicates that chronic hyperglycaemia is a
causal link between diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#41:1>
However , the precise mechanism by which hyperglycaemia may cause
complications in diabetic individuals remains to be clearly defined .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#42:1>
Data from familial <sp> 21 </sp> and ethnic <sp> 22 </sp> clusterings
of diabetic complications suggest that the susceptibility to
hyperglycaemia-induced tissue damage may be determined by genetic factors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#43:1>
Candidates genes such as the aldose reductase gene <sp> 23-25 </sp>
and fibrinogen gene, <sp> 26 </sp> which confer susceptibility to
microangiopathic and macroangiopathic complications respectively , have been
identified in various sib-pair linkage analyses <sp> 26 </sp> or case-control
studies. <sp> 23-26 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#44:1>
Microvascular manifestations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#45:1>
Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of blindness , end-stage
renal disease , and non-traumatic amputation in industrialised countries.
<sp> 27,28 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#46:1>
These conditions are the direct end-points of microvascular
complications that are specific to diabetes and which include retinopathy ,
nephropathy , and neuropathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#47:1>
The risks of these conditions developing can be significantly reduced
by optimising glycaemic control and if they are detected and treated early
through patient education and regular screening. <sp> 14,15,28 </sp> </p> <h>
<it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#48:1>
Retinopathy </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#49:1>
Retinopathy is an important complication of diabetes mellitus in
the Asian population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#50:1>
The prevalence between 1990 and 1996 for patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus has been estimated to be 22&percent; in Hong Kong,
<sp> 29 </sp> and a population-based study performed in China in 1986 showed
a prevalence of 31&percent;. <sp> 30 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#51:1>
Randomised controlled trials such as the DCCT and the United Kingdom
Prospective Diabetes Study &obrack;  UKPDS &cbrack; have shown conclusively that improving
glycaemic control can decrease the incidence of diabetic retinopathy. <sp>
14,15 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#52:1>
This concept is also supported by prospective follow-up studies among
Japanese and Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. <sp> 31,32 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#53:1>
Furthermore , the DCCT also demonstrated that strict glucose control
retards the progression of background , non-proliferative retinopathy. <sp>
14 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#54:1>
Thus , primary and secondary prevention of retinopathy can e
effectively accomplished by intensive glycaemic management and regular
ophthalmological screening. <sp> 14,15 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#55:1>
Proliferative retinopathy and macular oedema are late
complications in the continuum of diabetic retinal disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#56:1>
Research on tertiary prevention has shown that these conditions can
be treated using laser therapy , which reduces significantly the incidence of
severe visual loss and blindness. <sp> 33 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#57:1>
Despite these findings , only 35&percent; to 60&percent; of American diabetic people
currently undergo annual opthalmological screening. <sp> 34 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#58:1>
There is no corresponding estimate for Asian countries , where the
rate is conceivably even lower due to the long latent phase of retinopathy ,
a lack of health promotion activities , and scarce availability of resources
and services .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#59:1>
In Hong Kong , a recent cross-sectional study of 629 asymptomatic
type 2 patients revealed that 19&percent; and 3&percent; of subjects had non-proliferative
retinopathy and proliferative changes that required laser treatment ,
respectively. <sp> 35 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#60:1>
Thus , it is recommended that all diabetic patients undergo an annual
dilated fundal examination to screen for diabetic retinopathy. <sp> 28,36
</sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#61:1>
Nephropathy </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#62:1>
Diabetic nephropathy &obrack;  ie comprising microalbuminuria to
end-stage renal disease &cbrack; develops in approximately 35&percent; of patients with type
1 diabetes mellitus and between 15&percent; and 60&percent; of patients with the type 2
disease. <sp> 37 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#63:1>
It is the leading cause of chronic renal failure worldwide and is
responsible for about one third of patients who undergo dialysis. <sp> 38
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#64:1>
One of the initial markers of this condition is microalbuminuria ,
which indicates an increased risk of progression to nephropathy as well as an
elevated risk of cardiovascular events. <sp> 39 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#65:1>
The natural course of diabetic nephropathy is such that once overt
nephropathy develops , rental function progressively declines and culminates
in end-stage renal disease. <sp> 40,41 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#66:1>
Hence , as with retinopathy , optimal glucose preventive measure
against the development of diabetic nephropathy. <sp> 14,15 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#67:1>
In addition , all diabetic people should be screened for
proteinuria and microalbuminuria annually. <sp> 28,36 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#68:1>
There are various ways of performing urine tests; Table 1 shows the
diagnostic criteria for albuminuria. <sp> 42 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#69:1>
Measuring the random , spot albumin to creatinine ratio is a simple
technique that can be used as a screening test. <sp> 28 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#70:1>
Because of significant variations in urine albumin excretion ,
however , it is recommended that if the results of the first test are
positive for albumin , the test be repeated for confirmation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#71:1>
If the second test gives negative results , a third test should be
performed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#72:1>
Two of the three tests should given positive results and other
potential aetiologies should be excluded before the presence of
microalbuminuria can be concluded. <sp> 28,42 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#73:1>
If albuminuria is diagnosed , treatment with an
angiotensin-converting enzyme &obrack;  ACE &cbrack; inhibitor should be considered .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#74:1>
This treatment can reduce albuminuria and delay or possibly halt the
progression to nephropathy , independent of its blood pressure - lowering
effect. <sp> 43 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#75:1>
Aggressive blood pressure control is also of vital importance in
preventing progression of declining renal function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#76:1>
Maintaining the blood pressure is the only modality that has
consistently been shown to be effective in halting progression to overt
nephropathy and renal failure. <sp> 44 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#77:1>
Although absolute target blood pressure levels for patients with
diabetic nephropathy have not been well delineated , there is a clear
association between blood pressure and the rate of progression of diabetic
renal disease , in both Caucasian and Chinese populations. <sp> 44,45 </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#78:1>
There has recently been a renewed interest in the pathogenetic
role of hyperlipidaemia in diabetic nephropathy. <sp> 46 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#79:1>
Results from a prospective trial performed in Hong Kong have shown
that effective normalisation of hypercholesterolaemia might retard the
progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. <sp> 47
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#80:1>
The full potential of lipid-lowering therapy remains to be
established by longer-term studies with a larger sample of individuals . </p>
<h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#81:1>
Neuropathy </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#82:1>
Diabetic patients have an increased risk of the development of
neuropathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#83:1>
Foot ulcers may develop , mainly because of the abnormal distribution
of pressure owing to peripheral neuropathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#84:1>
A study in the United States showed that one half of a group f
patients who had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 15 years also had
diabetic neuropathy. <sp> 27 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#85:1>
Even among newly diagnosed case of type 2 diabetes mellitus ,
retrospective data from Hong Kong suggest a prevalence of neuropathy of
approximately 13&percent;. <sp> 29 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#86:1>
As with retinopathy and neuropathy , a policy of <O> Table </O>
strict glycaemic control reduces the incidence of neuropathy in patients with
either type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. <sp> 14,15 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#87:1>
The early detection of diabetic neuropathy results in fewer
hospitalisations of patients with foot ulcers and fewer lower-extremely
amputations. <sp> 48 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#88:1>
According , all diabetic patients should regularly undergo sensory
testing and be screened for foot ulceration at regular intervals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#89:1>
In the absence of clear evidence , consensus expert opinion suggests
annual sensory examination and opportunistic screening for foot ulceration at
each clinical encounter. <sp> 28,36 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#90:1>
Educating patients and increasing physician surveillance regarding
foot care and risk factors for amputation have been tested in a randomised
controlled trial and a prospective study .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#91:1>
Both studies reported significant reductions of serious foot
ulceration in the intervention groups. <sp> 49,50 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#92:1>
Macrovascular manifestations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#93:1>
Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for the
development of atherosclerosis. <sp> 51> </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#94:1>
On the other hand , atherosclerotic or macrovascular disease is
responsible for more than 50&percent; of all deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus. <sp> 27 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#95:1>
Cardiovascular disease accounts for most case of diabetic
macrovascular complications; the remainder are caused by cerebro-vascular
events and peripheral vascular disease. <sp> 52 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#96:1>
The results from a population-based study suggest that there is a
10-fold increase in coronary artery disease among Chinese diabetic patient
when compared with the characteristically low rate among non-diabetic
controls. <sp> 30 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#97:1>
While hyperglycaemia has been conclusively shown to be the causal
link between diabetes mellitus and microvascular complications , its
association with macrovascular manifestations is much more tenuous , as
reflected by the results of the UKPDS and the DCCT. <sp> 14,15 <sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#98:1>
In the UKPDS , the number of macrovascular events greatly outnumbered
that of microvascular complications , but the difference was found to be
non-significant .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#99:1>
This result was not wholly unexpected given the multifactorial nature
of cardiovascular disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#100:1>
Factors such as hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , and tobacco use
contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic people .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#101:1>
Hence , hyper-tensive control , lowering lipid levels , and smoking
cessation are important preventive measures that can help prevent the
development of macrovascular diabetic complications. <sp> 28,36 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#102:1>
Hypertension develops in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus at
twice the rate of those who are non-diabetic. <sp> 53 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#103:1>
Hypertension is a major contributor to atherosclerotic diseases and
can lead to a more rapid progression of nephropathy and renal failure. <sp>
54,55 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#104:1>
The UKPDS has a demonstrated that a policy of rigorous blood
pressure control reduces the risk of macrovascular and microvascular
complications in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus , even more so than
the effect of strict glycaemic management. <sp> 44 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#105:1>
Thus , screening and treating hypertensive diabetic patients are
essential .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#106:1>
There is no clear evidence to support a specified goal in blood
pressure control , although the UKPDS used an upper limit of 150/85 mm Hg as
its definition of stringent hyper-tensive control. <sp> 44 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#107:1>
Elevated serum lipid levels are also a significant risk factor
in the development of macrovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#108:1>
There are no large randomised controlled trails reported that
evaluate the effectiveness of giving lipid-lowering treatment to diabetic
patients who have an abnormal lipid profile and are at risk of heart disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#109:1>
However , small subgroup analyses of two studies of high-risk
diabetic individuals have shown that lowering low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol levels leads to a &ldquo; significant reduction in
cardiovascular mortality. <sp> 56,57 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#110:1>
Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in diabetic
patients and its associated morbidity and mortality, <sp> 27 </sp> a
conservative approach would be to screen for hyperlipidaemia annually and to
treat the condition as soon as it is detected . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#111:1>
It is well known that tobacco use and diabetes mellitus are
synergistic risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. <sp>
58 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#112:1>
Smoking is also responsible for a whole spectrum of other diseases ,
which include numerous cancers and chronic lung disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#113:1>
It follows that all possible measures should be used to prevent
people from starting the habit , and to encourage smokers to stop ,
especially in the diabetic population. <sp> 28,36 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#114:1>
The traditionally  ' soft ' cardiovascular risk factors of obesity
and a sedentary lifestyle may be particularly important in South Asian &obrack; 
India , Pakistani , and Bangladeshi &cbrack; diabetic patients .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#115:1>
Observational studies have demonstrated higher mortality and
morbidity rates of cardiovascular disease in overseas migrants of South Asian
descent who have diabetes , compared with other ethnic groups. <sp> 59 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#116:1>
It has been hypothesized that the high mortality rate is due to
metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance. <sp> 59 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#117:1>
Results from the United Kingdom have confirmed the existence of
insulin resistance syndrome &obrack;  glucose intolerance , hyperinsulinaemia ,
hypertension , low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ,
and high levels of triglycerides &cbrack; , which is especially prevalent in South
Asians and which is associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity.
<sp> 59 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#118:1>
Thus , the management of obesity preventive measures against
diabetes mellitus and coronary arties disease in this vulnerable population .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#119:1>
The economic burden of diabetes mellitus and its complications
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#120:1>
Diabetes mellitus is a major and increasing cause of chronic ill
health and premature mortality in almost all Asian countries, <sp> 1-7 </sp>
and results in rising cost because of absence form work and health care
expenses. <sp> 8,60 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#121:1>
To facilitate service planning and to allocate public health
resources appropriately , there should be reliable estimates and projections
of the economic costs associated with diabetes mellitus , its complications ,
and its co-morbidities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#122:1>
This is especially true in Asian countries where there is a dynamic
, growing epidemic of diabetes. <sp> 1-3 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#123:1>
There are two main approaches to investigating the economic
impact of diabetes mellitus and its complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#124:1>
The first approach uses disability-adjusted life-years &obrack;  DALYs &cbrack; to
measure the intangible costs associated with the disease , and combines the
healthy life-years lost as a result of premature mortality with those lost
due to disability or ill health .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#125:1>
This method is valuable , because a substantial portion of health
care expenditure is directed towards improving the quality of life and life
expectancy in diabetic individuals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#126:1>
The largest relevant study that has been published so far was
performed by the World Bank in 1993. <sp> 61 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#127:1>
Their global study investigated the DALYs lost due to various
diseases , including diabetes , and estimated that 1362 million DALYs were
lost worldwide as a result of all illnesses in 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#128:1>
Of these , diabetes mellitus and its complication accounted for 7.97
million DALYs , as shown in Table 2. <sp> 61 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#129:1>
The majority of losses were incurred in developing nations &obrack;  eg
China and India &cbrack; .

When comparing the DALYs lost with per capita health expenditure in
different countries , the data suggested that the countries in which 80&percent; of
the DALYs lost were attributable to diabetes mellitus shared only 13&percent; of the
world  ' s health care expenditures. <sp> 60 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#131:1>
For example , with an annual per capita expenditure on health care
of US$21 , the population of India lost 1.9 million DALYs because of diabetes
mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#132:1>
In contrast , established market economics such as the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development nations , which account for 15&percent; of
the world  ' s population and 87&percent; of its health care resources , together lost
only 1.3 million DALYs because of diabetes mellitus. <sp> 60 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#133:1>
In short , the heavy economic burden of this life-long condition due
to loss of quality of life and premature mortality is concentrated in those
countries with the lowest health care budgets , many of which are in Asia.
<sp> 60,61 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#134:1>
Despite some criticisms and caveats about methodological issues ,
the World Bank study provides strong support for the need to improve the
provision of diabetes health services in Asian countries , particularly in
those under-going rapid demographic and economic development. <sp> 61 </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#135:1>
The second and most frequently employed technique used to
evaluate the economic implication of diabetes is the cost-of-illness approach
, which examines the direct and indirect costs associated with the condition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#136:1>
In Asia , there has been little systematic effort to conduct
comprehensive examinations of the economic consequences of diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#137:1>
In the United States , direct medical expenditures attributes to
diabetes mellitus in 1997 totalled US$44.2 billion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#138:1>
The breakdown was as follows: US$7.7 billion because of diabetes and
acute glycaemic care , US$11.8 billion because of the excess prevalence of
related microvascular and macrovascular complications , and US$24.6 billion
because of the excess prevalence of general medical conditions. <sp> 8 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#139:1>
Of these direct costs , 62&percent; , 25&percent; , and 13&percent; were related to in-
patient care , ambulatory services , and long-term care , respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#140:1>
Two third of all medical costs were borne by the elderly &obrack;  aged > 65
years &cbrack; population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#141:1>
Attributable indirect costs totalled US$54.1 billion and comprised
US$17.0 billion due to premature mortality and US$37.2 billion due to
disability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#142:1>
Furthermore , total medical expenditure incurred by diabetic
patients was US$10 071 per capita , compared with US$2669 for the
non-diabetic population. <sp> 8 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#143:1>
Likewise , the economic <O> Table </O> burden of diabetes mellitus
in Asia is enormous , anticipated by the prevalence and incidence of the
disease and is predicted to increase more in Asia than in the industrialised
western nations in the next few decades. <sp> 1-3,60 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#144:1>
It has been estimated that the overall health care costs due to
diabetes mellitus in the year 2000 will be doubled when compared with 1990.

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#145:1>
Implications of public health and health care </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#146:1>
Given by the very serious clinical and economic ramifications of
the diabetes mellitus , it is imperative that doctors , public health
practitioners , and policy makers vigorously pursue health care strategies
and medical innovations that can delay the onset and slow the progression of
the disease and its complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#147:1>
One strategy is to reduce the incidence of diabetes mellitus in Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#148:1>
While genetic factors have a definite role in the development of the
disease , there are also environmental and lifestyle risk factors , such as a
high saturated fat diet , obesity , and lack of physical activity. <sp> 1,3
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#149:1>
These three risk factors are currently recognised as the most
potentially modifiable .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#150:1>
Although implementing lifestyle changes , as with any behavioural
change , poses a difficult challenge , doing so is essential to improving
public health and lessening the impact of the Asian diabetes epidemic . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#151:1>
A second , complementary strategy is to focus on the primary and
secondary prevention of diabetic complications individual who have already
developed diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#152:1>
The DCCT and UKPDS have shown that optimal glycaemic control is the
most ideal primary preventive measure against the development of
complications. <sp> 14,15 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#153:1>
It is also well known that treating complications such as eye and
limb diseases , heart disease , neuropathy , and nephropathy contribute the
most of the costs of diabetes care. <sp> 62 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#154:1>
Once complications develop , the indirect costs of disability and
premature mortality increase exponentially; hence , the secondary prevention
of diabetic complications may be highly effective in reducing the health care
burden of diabetes mellitus in general. <sp> 63 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#155:1>
Such secondary preventive measures include a policy of strict blood
pressure control, <sp> 44 </sp> institution of ACE inhibition in
microalbuminuric patients, <sp> 43 </sp> normalization of hyperlipidaemia,
<sp> 47,56,57 </sp> smoking cessation, <sp> 28,36 </sp> and regular screening
for all diabetic complications. <sp> 28,36 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#156:1>
A third major component is combating the diabetes epidemic in
Asia who involves health promotion and patient education .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#157:1>
The reasons are two-fold .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#158:1>
Firstly , there are many undiagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus in
Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#159:1>
For example , the ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed cases in Vietnam
and Bangladesh is as high as 4:1. <sp> 1,4 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#160:1>
There is thus a serious potential for severe diabetic complications
to occur because of prolonged undiagnosed hyperglycaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#161:1>
Secondly , the clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
its complications are usually insidious and have a long latent period .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#162:1>
As a consequence , patient compliance with regular follow-up and
screening may be poor because the conditions are asymptomatic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#163:1>
Patients therefore need to be adequately informed of the necessity
and benefits of these clinical interventions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#164:1>
Financial constraints in some developing Asian economies , however ,
may render optimal diabetes care impossible .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#165:1>
Even when the services are provided , they may be inadequate or
inaccessible to patients. <sp> 34 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#166:1>
Finally , increases in both the cost of providing quality
diabetes care and the number of people developing the disease have led to a
search for more cost-effective models of care .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#167:1>
One such model is the  ' shared care ' approach , the efficacy of which
has been well documented. <sp> 64,65 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#168:1>
In this approach , both specialists and primary care doctors
participate in the planned delivery of care; they also exchange information
over and above routine discharge and referral notes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#169:1>
Hallmarks of effective and efficient shared-care schemes include
computerised central recall with prompts for patients and their family
doctors , shared records , improved communication between doctors and
patients , flexible and agreed management plans , the possibility of patients
moving up and down the levels of care , and a fail-safe system of coordinated
care. <sp> 64,65 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#170:1>
Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-026#171:1>
The growing Asian epidemic of diabetes mellitus , and its
implications in terms of morbidity , mortality and economic costs of its
complications , calls for urgent attention from clinicians , public health
officials , and governments .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#172:1>
Doctors should be encouraged to implement primary and secondary
preventive measures that have been proven to be effective , while community
health workers should actively promote diabetes education to diagnosed
patients as well as to the general public .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#173:1>
Furthermore , government agencies should increase and redirect
appropriate human and financial resources towards services for the diabetic
population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#174:1>
When the demand exceeds the realistic possibility of supplying the
needed services , which is the case in many developing countries in Asia ,
the limited health care resources must be rationally allocated to programmes
of proven efficacy. <sp> 66 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-026#175:1>
This is a tough challenge indeed , and the decisions made will
influence the quality of diabetes care in Asia . </p>
