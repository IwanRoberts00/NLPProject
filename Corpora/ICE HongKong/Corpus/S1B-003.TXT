<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#1:1:A>
Uh so when things settled down in the perception then it
becomes simple and clear

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#2:1:A>
And so a circle with with break you will see a circle that is a law
of <?> Fenance </?> but that particular <,> uh phenomenon you can use a rule
or a law to describe it that is called what

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#3:1:A>
A circle with break you will see it as a circle and is called

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X4:1:Z>
Similarity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#5:1:A>
Huh

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X6:1:Z>
Similarity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#7:1:A>
No not similarity

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#8:1:A>
It  ' s called

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X9:1:Z>
Closure </X>

<$Z3> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X10:1:Z>
Closure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#11:1:A>
What

<$Z3> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X12:1:Z>
Closure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#13:1:A>
Closure yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#14:1:A>
It  ' s closure

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#15:1:A>
Closure

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#16:1:A>
And if uh you have a number of dots and instead of seeing uhm a
number of dots equal in distance from each other you would organize this
material

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#17:1:A>
If if if the distance from other sometimes you will see there  ' s
row and sometime you will see it as column

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#18:1:A>
But if they are closed together for example in this distance closed
together you will see three columns

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#19:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#20:1:A>
That is a principle of

<$Z4> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X21:1:Z>
Promixity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#22:1:A>
Huh

<$Z4> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X23:1:Z>
Promixity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#24:1:A>
Proximity <{> <[> proximity </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#25:1:A>
There is a principal of proximity

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#26:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#27:1:A>
And if you have although distance here is greater than this one
<,,> you may still see these as two rows

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#28:1:A>
I mean these two column

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#29:1:A>
You will still see as two column

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#30:1:A>
And that is called the principal of

<$Z4> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X31:1:Z>
<[> Promxi </[> </{> </X>

<$Z5> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X32:1:Z>
Similarity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#33:1:A>
Similarity

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#34:1:A>
That is called the principal of similarity

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#35:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#36:1:A>
So all these are conceptual phenomenon when become settled down in
front of the periphery

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#37:1:A>
It becomes simpler in form

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#38:1:A>
So instead of seeing six items in this picture

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#39:1:A>
What you see are two items

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#40:1:A>
The <.> t </.> two items is simpler than six item

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#41:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#42:1:A>
So picture of two item in being to see instead of picture of six
items

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#43:1:A>
What is the third method

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#44:1:A>
The third method <&> Unidentified speeches </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#45:1:A>
What is the third one <&> Unidentified speeches </&>

<$Z6> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#X46:1:Z>
Invariant <unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-003#47:1:A>
Invariant yeah

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#48:1:A>
It  ' s a very word

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#49:1:A>
Invariant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#50:1:A>
So it means uh invariant is something inside or outside

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#51:1:A>
Invariant is something is outside

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#52:1:A>
So you want to detect

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#53:1:A>
You want to find out

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#54:1:A>
You want to pick up so to speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#55:1:A>
Just like pick up a piece of chalk

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#56:1:A>
Invariant is there

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#57:1:A>
I want to pick it up

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#58:1:A>
So you don't you don't pick it up with your hand

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#59:1:A>
You pick it up with your eye okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#60:1:A>
Okay so invariant uh you pick up with your sensory organ

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#61:1:A>
Of course you can still pick your pen by touching it

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#62:1:A>
Uh this this is it

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#63:1:A>
Uh uh pick picking up the invariant through the <?> haptic </?>
system okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#64:1:A>
You can pick this up through your ears

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#65:1:A>
You can pick the all the to carry up through your eye and you can
pick this up with other sensory modalities

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#66:1:A>
Pick up invariants

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#67:1:A>
And the invariant is form of ratio in the forms of complex variants

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#68:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#69:1:A>
The ratio is just a number

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#70:1:A>
In the complex variable we has dimension but its dimensions is
quite different from the ordinary uh perimeter

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#71:1:A>
We have like speed like as a ration it has a different uh <.> vari
</.> a <.> di di </.> different uhm what  ' s that uh dimension composed of a
number of different perimeters

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#72:1:A>
But why it  ' s called invariant because it does not change while
other perimeter change

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#73:1:A>
Like Y equal to uh AX

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#74:1:A>
If A is invariant what does it mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#75:1:A>
A means invariant means it  ' s constant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#76:1:A>
It is constant so why why it  ' s changed

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#77:1:A>
X is also changing like the relationship between Y and X is a
constant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#78:1:A>
Let  ' s say A is true then whenever Y is equal to four X equals to
two

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#79:1:A>
When Y equal to six X is equal to three

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#80:1:A>
And Y is equal to eight and then X equal to four

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#81:1:A>
So while Y and X are changing it  ' s constant remained constant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#82:1:A>
Remain invariant so to speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#83:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#84:1:A>
So for example if uh a certain chair is sitable

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#85:1:A>
I mean you can sit on it

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#86:1:A>
You can actually see that the chair you can sit down or <?> you get
</?> a stone a piece of stone you can <.> s </.> uh you can sit on it

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#87:1:A>
Okay it  ' s an invariant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#88:1:A>
Invariant with what

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#89:1:A>
Invariant with your height of your knee

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#90:1:A>
So suppose it  ' s is uh uh a tall question

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#91:1:A>
Call this uh see this chair is sitable

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#92:1:A>
But is nearly to his knee height

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#93:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#94:1:A>
Another person who he is very short here

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#95:1:A>
His knee height is here and but this is this is uh also uh lower

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#96:1:A>
So this person will see this is sitable

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#97:1:A>
So the sitable <,> property although it varies from person to
person but you will find it constant here

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#98:1:A>
The constant is appropriate to the knee height

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#99:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#100:1:A>
That is not change

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#101:1:A>
That is invariant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#102:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#103:1:A>
Now I  ' ve shown you before that that uh which one is taller
depends on this ratio of this one over this one

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#104:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#105:1:A>
So you may see that uh all these distance may be changing some
some is here some is here <,> and so on

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#106:1:A>
But you see the ratio of this one of over this one uh if they are
of equal height <,> no matter where you place it <,> you have the same ratio
<,> invariant

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#107:1:A>
So if the ratio is higher than the other one <,> so no matter <,>
how long this part is so if it is further very far away it  ' s very short

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#108:1:A>
So the actual length varies

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#109:1:A>
The actual change

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#110:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#111:1:A>
But the fact is that <,> this over this is greater this over this

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#112:1:A>
This is not change

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#113:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#114:1:A>
And this specify that this is taller than this one <&> The
lecturer asked the students whether they understood what he had just said
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#115:1:A>
So something is not change in this case the ratio uh or the
difference in ratio is not change

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#116:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#117:1:A>
So this is an invariant okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#118:1:A>
You want to pick up in eye and immediately perceive the property
of the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#119:1:A>
Any other question uh you want to ask <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#120:1:A>
If not we will continue to study memory <&> The lecturer said he
assumed everyone had watched the required materials in the library </&> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#121:1:A>
Now look at these there are three three rows of uh letter and
object

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#122:1:A>
Now <,> see whether you can remember them all

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#123:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#124:1:A>
Now I just give you a a a <.> min </.> a <.> sec </.> a minute

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#125:1:A>
Uh I mean a second

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#126:1:A>
And you look at all these three rows

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#127:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#128:1:A>
We are going to think about in memory and thinking is what are
their nature and how to improve that

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#129:1:A>
Now we have a number of uh questions to consider

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#130:1:A>
First uh uh memory is coded in different stores

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#131:1:A>
So if you remember something

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#132:1:A>
Is it remember means you put something in a store

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#133:1:A>
You see in question is what are the necessary necessary process to
make memories permanent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#134:1:A>
So only when memory are permanent then you can recall them you can
remember them

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#135:1:A>
So how to make them permanent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#136:1:A>
How to improve memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#137:1:A>
Is recall a pure retrieval means taking it out from the memory
store or it is a reconstruction

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#138:1:A>
What what factors would affect thinking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#139:1:A>
So all these <,> we we  ' ll know after <.> thi </.> this class

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#140:1:A>
Here is the uhm the outline

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#141:1:A>
So we will study three types of memories

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#142:1:A>
The sensory memory the short-term memory and the long-term memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#143:1:A>
And then we will talk about the active role of memory <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#144:1:A>
Under each memory whether it is sensory whether it is short-term
or whether it is long-term we  ' ll talk about the nature and we will prove its
existence

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#145:1:A>
And also we will talk about decay or forgetting <,> related to
that kind of memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#146:1:A>
There are three kinds of memory sensory short-term and long-term

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#147:1:A>
And after that I think we have time and then we will talk about
thinking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#148:1:A>
What are the elements of thinking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#149:1:A>
And the factors and style <,> that affect of the effectiveness of
thinking <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#150:1:A>
Let us start <,> the first one

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#151:1:A>
Sensory memory <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#152:1:A>
Now <,> there are several kinds of sensory memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#153:1:A>
Well actually the sensory memory is <,> the residue <,> the
residual sensory excitation which still remains with your sensory receptor
<,> immediately after <,> the uh energy <,> activate your your sensory cell

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#154:1:A>
So in the case of the uhm sensory receptor in the eye <,> the
photo receptor so immediately after its excitation here <,> the light
disappear but still this one is being activated remain activated

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#155:1:A>
So with a short period of time <,> the cells still uh <,> remain
activated

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#156:1:A>
And there are at least two types that we have investigated

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#157:1:A>
The first is called iconic memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#158:1:A>
It  ' s related to eye

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#159:1:A>
The second is calls echoic memory that is related to auditory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#160:1:A>
One thing is very important is that <,> every information <,> is
being processed

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#161:1:A>
So when you see with this iconic memory everything is being
registered

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#162:1:A>
Everything is being uh coded

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#163:1:A>
Everything is being process okay <&> the lecturer explained that
the brain received every sensory stimulus and processed it </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#164:1:A>
So in that sense is called parallel processing

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#165:1:A>
So parallel <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#166:1:A>
If you are not uh pay attention to that particular item <,> that
particular item is already <,> in your uh iconic memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#167:1:A>
Let  ' s say you  ' re reading these nine letters <,> oh no no no
should be nine but twelve

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#168:1:A>
Twelve

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#169:1:A>
Uh <,> and then I ask you to report the first line and then you
actually report it with still the image in your mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#170:1:A>
Still the image is there

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#171:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#172:1:A>
So although you have you are you are paying attention here

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#173:1:A>
Although you are paying attention <,> try to remember this last
line

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#174:1:A>
But as as soon as you uh heard me say me <&> a few Cantonese words
</&> suppose and then you try to <.> pr </.> reproduce try to report this
first line

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#175:1:A>
And then actually you are looking it in your <.> m </.> in your
mind inside the first line

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#176:1:A>
So you do not have to pay attention there because uh uh uh to to
make a trace of the uh sensory information is already there

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#177:1:A>
So everything is being process

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#178:1:A>
They are processed in parallel

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#179:1:A>
This is very important

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#180:1:A>
So the first nature is that <,> it is the residual <,> excitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#181:1:A>
Second is that in it is processed in parallel

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#182:1:A>
And third it is decayed very easily

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#183:1:A>
So it is it only exists here for a short period of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#184:1:A>
So if I ask you to report all these twelve letters

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#185:1:A>
You failed to do it

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#186:1:A>
Performance therefore is only thirty percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#187:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#188:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#189:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#190:1:A>
Because it decay already

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#191:1:A>
So after you report the first line <,> or at the beginning of the
second line <,> all these memory trace gone

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#192:1:A>
So all these is the all these memory trace are gone so you can
only report at most a little bit over than one line

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#193:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#194:1:A>
So how long with this you take for the uh iconic memory to decay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#195:1:A>
Less than two seconds

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#196:1:A>
How long does it take for the iconic iconic <.> co </.> echoic
memory to decay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#197:1:A>
Less than five second

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#198:1:A>
So it  ' s true to five second <,> everything is gone

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#199:1:A>
Of course it depends on its strength of the sensory information

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#200:1:A>
If the strong light strong contrast it will stay there for a
longer time

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#201:1:A>
If it is not it will <.> b </.> it will stay there for a shorter
period of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#202:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#203:1:A>
If the sound is very loud <,> it would leave a better uh echoic
memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#204:1:A>
If the sound is weak <,> then the echoic memory is very weak

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#205:1:A>
And it will die down more readily more quickly

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#206:1:A>
So again roughly it is from two second maximum for iconic memory
and five second for echoic memory <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#207:1:A>
Now evidence of its existence uh is demonstrated by <?> Sperling
</?>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#208:1:A>
If I ask you to report all these twelve letters and number and the
performance is thirty percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#209:1:A>
If I uh give you the indication of a line it  ' s about seventy
percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#210:1:A>
Seventy something percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#211:1:A>
If I <,> have a <,> a a a line <,> underneath <,> the letter

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#212:1:A>
Nah if I want to reproduce report nine I have a bar underneath the
the line afterwards <,> immediately afterwards <,> then you are going to
report that particular letter <,> above that line okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#213:1:A>
Then the <.> successiv </.> successful rate will be one hundred
percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#214:1:A>
So whether you are looking at this one or this one or this one
which one

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#215:1:A>
When the letter is covere up <,> and a a bar appear underneath a
letter and <unc> one word </unc> you immediately can see the letter

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#216:1:A>
You can see virtually see <,> in your iconic memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#217:1:A>
So the successful rate is one hundred percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#218:1:A>
So as the success rate is one hundred <.> perce </.> percent it
means you can still have this letter in your memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#219:1:A>
Of course if you uh as a time delay if you have a time delay uh
let  ' s say this the presentation of the letter here and this is uh disappear
of uh these letters and here is the indication immediately afterwards you
will have one hundred percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#220:1:A>
But suppose you have a time delay <,> you would only give the bar
at this time

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#221:1:A>
So this is a time delay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#222:1:A>
And if performance <.> ra </.> performance rate will decrease if
the uh delay is lengthened

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#223:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#224:1:A>
So it means that for example if it is later than it  ' s longer than
two second so all the memory all the iconic memory has decayed and then the
performance here will be zero

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#225:1:A>
Or by chance you have can only have uh <,> let say uh a ten
percent or five percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#226:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#227:1:A>
And so will explain uh <,> uh could demonstrate the existence of
these iconic memory in this method

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#228:1:A>
Will also <,> this iconic memory can be wiped out can be immediate
immediately wiped out by using a technique called masking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#229:1:A>
It  ' s technique of masking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#230:1:A>
What is masking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#231:1:A>
Masking is <,> let  ' s say uh now you can hear a word <,> like uh
ticket

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#232:1:A>
It appear for a very short period of time

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#233:1:A>
Let  ' s say appear only for uh nine millisecond

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#234:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#235:1:A>
Nine millisecond

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#236:1:A>
And then immediately I cover it up that means this is the
presentation of the ticket it only last uh nine millisecond and immediately I
present another one

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#237:1:A>
Another stimulus

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#238:1:A>
The stimulus is like this <O> tapping sound </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#239:1:A>
And the ticket and more ticket is being wiped out

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#240:1:A>
And ask you what can you see

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#241:1:A>
And you can see all only all the process

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#242:1:A>
Not the ticket

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#243:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#244:1:A>
So this method is called masking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#245:1:A>
To get rid of the iconic uh memory trace

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#246:1:A>
Well this uh idea of masking it  ' s very useful for a number of
research

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#247:1:A>
So this this this is quite interesting uh kind of uh <,,> quite
interesting kind of uh phenomenon uh in masking

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#248:1:A>
So this is the sensory memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#249:1:A>
So we will go to the second one

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#250:1:A>
The short- term memory <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#251:1:A>
Well previously people thought that you have a separate store
memory store

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#252:1:A>
So a store for long-term memory a store for short-term memory

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#253:1:A>
The short-term and long-term <,> they are of different stores

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#254:1:A>
And now they know that it is not the case

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#255:1:A>
Short-term memory is only the activated portion of the storage

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#256:1:A>
Long-term and the short-term are of the same in nature

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#257:1:A>
Or the same location

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#258:1:A>
The only difference is that <,> the portion which is called the
short-term memory <,> they are activated <,,> they are excited so suppose <,>
you can think of the long-term memory as a connected network of cells <?>
neuro </?> cells

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#259:1:A>
So each <?> neuros </?> each neuron is a note is this picture

<ICE-HK:S1B-003#260:1:A>
So each note represent a certain item like this represent the bird
and this represent the wing and this uh fly and so on </I>
