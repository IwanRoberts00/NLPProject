<[2> Oh really </[2> </{2> <&>

$B laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#88:1:B>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X89:1:Z>
Do you speak Mandarin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#90:1:B>

<$Z> <X>

How is she going to get by <,> in Beijing <{> <[> without any
Mandarin </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#92:1:B>
<[> Is it a big </[> </{> problem if I don't speak Mandarin

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#93:1:B>
Uh because I just finished uhm beginner  ' s course <&>

$Z laughed </&> and I I don't think I can <,> tackle the real problem <&>

$Z laughed </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#94:1:A>
Uh I think that  ' s a real problem for you

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#95:1:A>
I speak Mandarin

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#96:1:A>
I  ' ve finished the advance course <,> but <,> I think the local <.>
Bei </.> Beijing people speak <,> the the <,> the Mandarin they speak is a
little bit different because uhm <,> the Putonghua we we speak <,> uhm <,>
include just part of the Beijing dialect

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#97:1:A>
But in Beijing most people especially the <,> uhm people who are
less educated they speak Beijing dialect which is really difficult for us to
understand

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#98:1:A>
Even I myself I finished advance course I <,> can't hear what they
say <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#99:1:A>
So if you don't <,> know Mandarin that will be a big problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#100:1:A>
You have to write all the time

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#101:1:B>
Oh <&> laughed </&>

<[1> Then I </[1> </{1> went back to Beijing

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#123:1:A>
But it  ' s very difficult to uhm <,> get a ticket

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#124:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#126:1:B>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#127:1:B>

Is it <?> difficult </?> to uh buy a <,,> ticket

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#129:1:A>
There  ' s there  ' s a special office for <,> foreign visitors

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#130:1:A>

<[> Yes </[> </{> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#277:1:Z>
I once took a train from Tokyo <,> down to Hiroshima <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#278:1:Z>
And <,> it was a very beautiful train <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#279:1:Z>
But we went into the dining car to have lunch and uhm my children
were quite small at the time and very blonde <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#280:1:Z>
And uhm <,> the way the dining car is organized is that there is a
a hallway a <{2> <[2> corridor </[2> going along the side and then there  ' s a
glass wall <{3> <[3> and </[3> then the dining compartment <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#281:1:Z>
Uhm and then the corridor is very narrow <,> uh so people wanting
to go from one carriage to another pass the dining car have to go along that
narrow

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#282:1:Z>
But they can look through the glass window <{5> <[5> <,> </[5> and
see the people having their lunch

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#283:1:Z>
And these Japanese men were stopping to take photographs of me and
my children because we are blonde

<$B> <&> laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#284:1:B>
I was sitting there eating my lunch and they  ' re taking
photographs of me

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#285:1:B>
I got such a shock

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#286:1:B>
Oh </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#287:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#288:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#289:1:B>
<[3> Uh </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#290:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#291:1:A>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#292:1:B>
But I know uhm <,> they like foreigners very much especially
the US people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X293:1:Z>
That I found that the Japanese people were very polite even just
coming from Narita Airport we went by train and to Tokyo city <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X294:1:Z>
And we had suitcases and the children were very little

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X295:1:Z>
And <,> this man could see that <,> that was a bit of a problem
and he was so nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X296:1:Z>
He came out of his way

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X297:1:Z>
He didn't get off the train when he should have

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X298:1:Z>
And he came with us <,> to help us with our bags everything

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X299:1:Z>
And then he was so nice so polite <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X300:1:Z>
I can't imagine that happening in Hong Kong <&> laughed </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#301:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#302:1:B>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#303:1:B>
So do you do you like Japan

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X304:1:Z>
I did

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X305:1:Z>
I did

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X306:1:Z>
I mean it was long time ago

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X307:1:Z>
It  ' s in nineteen eighty <,> four <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X308:1:Z>
Uhm so it  ' s ten years ago <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X309:1:Z>
Uhm <,> but I did like it <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X310:1:Z>
I particularly liked the trains <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X311:1:Z>
They are so efficient <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> because when we came
back from Hiroshima we were supposed to get on a train that left Hiroshima at
one minute past four <{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X312:1:Z>
And so we went to the platform and at about <,> one minute to
four <,> the train came in <,> and we got on the train <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X313:1:Z>
And it left almost straight away at four o'clock and we had heard
these wonderful stories about how <,,> absolutely accurate Japanese trains
are <,> never late but I thought this was a bit poor cos it left one minute
early <&>

$A and

$B laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X314:1:Z>
That if it hadn't been one minute early it was the wrong train

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X315:1:Z>
Right behind the train we got on was another train <{5> <[5> <,>
that was </[5> going to leave at one minute past <{6> <[6> <,> and </[6> we
were on the wrong train <{7> <[7> <,> </[7> so we had to at the next station
we had to get off the train stand on the platform wait for one minute <&> all
laughed </&> to get on the next train </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#316:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#317:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#318:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#319:1:A>
<[4> Uh uh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#320:1:A>
<[5> Uh uh

<unc> two-words </unc> </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#322:1:A>
<[6> Uh uh </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#323:1:A>
<[7> Uhm </[7> </{7>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#324:1:A>
How  ' s it compared with the trains in France or Germany

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X325:1:Z>
Oh <,> much better

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X326:1:Z>
I don't

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X327:1:Z>
I I don't think there are any better trains <,> than the ones in
in Japan

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X328:1:Z>
I mean I  ' ve been on trains through Europe

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X329:1:Z>
I  ' ve been on trains uhm <,> in Australia

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X330:1:Z>

But uhm <,> well <,> I don't want to talk about Japanese

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#352:1:A>
I get rather emotional when I talk about them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X353:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#354:1:A>
And <,> I think <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#355:1:A>
Uhm I don't think they  ' re as perfect as you  ' re talking about
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#356:1:A>
Uh one of my friend go to Japan last year <,> and when she get
there <,> uhm she feel she felt very uncomfortable she <,> she <.> fe </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#357:1:A>
Uhm <,> she said every people <,> was uh were staring at her <{2>
<[2> because </[2> she is a foreigner
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#> She is a <,> Chinese

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#358:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X359:1:Z>
<[2> Like </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X360:1:Z>
Maybe the Japanese are more prejudiced against Chinese than they
are against Europeans </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#361:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X362:1:Z>
Because I didn't really feel any <,> prejudice <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1> when I was there <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X363:1:Z>
Uhm but then the Japanese men do <,> love blonde hair

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X364:1:Z>
Maybe you should dye your hair before you go <{2> <[2> <&> all
laughed </&> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X365:1:Z>
Uhm but I know my uncle

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X366:1:Z>
Uhm I mean he fought in the war <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X367:1:Z>
Uhm he wasn't actually in Japan he was in <,> Italy <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4> uhm and in the African Desert

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X368:1:Z>
Uhm but the attitude of <,> New Zealanders who <,> were alive
during the war like my mother and her brothers and sisters is that although
Japan <,> didn't take New Zealand <{5> <[5> during </[5> the war <{6> <[6>
<,> </[6> they  ' re buying it now </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#369:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#370:1:B>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#371:1:B>
<[3> Uh uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#372:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#373:1:B>
<[5> Uhm uhm </[5> </{5>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#374:1:B>
<[6> Uhm uhm </[6> </{6>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#375:1:B>
Huh

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#376:1:A>
Uh not only New Zealand

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X377:1:Z>
Oh not at all only New Zealand but that  ' s all it bothers my
family <&> laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X378:1:Z>
They don't care <?> of course about </?> <,> other countries <&>
laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X379:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#380:1:B>
Do they hate Hong Kong people because many people <,>
emigrate to Australia this year

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X381:1:Z>
Well <,> uhm I  ' m not sure about Australia

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X382:1:Z>
Uhm in New Zealand <,> there there are a few problems

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X383:1:Z>
Uhm <,,> but the problem aren't really racial <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X384:1:Z>
Uhm there are problems like uhm Hong Kong families have taken
their children down <,> so that they can go to school and get New Zealand
passports

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X385:1:Z>
But the family doesn't stay down there
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#> The children stay on
their own

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X386:1:Z>
They live in a house by themselves <,> and uh of course they get
into a lot of trouble <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X387:1:Z>
No mother or father to look after them

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X388:1:Z>
Nobody <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X389:1:Z>
So you  ' ve get these teenage children who can just <,> run riot
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X390:1:Z>
And and a lot of these children have been going to the school
where my <,> brother  ' s children go and and there  ' s been a lot of trouble in
the school

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X391:1:Z>
Uhm and the other problem is <,> New Zealanders are fairly
relaxed <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and Hong Kong people are fairly hard working <&>
all laughed </&> and the combination doesn't always work well because the
Hong Kong children come in <,> they work very hard at school <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> they get As and the New Zealand children <,> are a little bit

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X392:1:Z>
Well they begrudge <,> it

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X393:1:Z>
They say you know why should you come in here and and get A
grades

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X394:1:Z>
Uhm why don't you learn to do nothing like <&> laughed </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X395:1:Z>
And I think it  ' s probably worse in Australia cos I think
Australians are even more lazy than New Zealanders </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#396:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#397:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#398:1:A>
<[3> Uh uh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#399:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X400:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#401:1:A>
How about the estate market

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X402:1:Z>
The which </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#403:1:A>
Uh the property market

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X404:1:Z>
In New Zealand </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#405:1:A>
Yeah because I I  ' ve heard <,> uhm <,> when Hong Kong go when
Hong Kong people go to a place <,> they will make the property market the
price of the property market to go up

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X406:1:Z>
Well <,> that  ' s true

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X407:1:Z>
<{1> <[1> Uhm </[1> <,> I think that would happen anywhere <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X408:1:Z>
Uhm it  ' s not <,> particularly a big problem in New Zealand <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X409:1:Z>
Uhm <,> because we  ' ve got a lot of land <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X410:1:Z>
See our our country is <,> the size of Great Britain <{3> <[3>
<,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X411:1:Z>
We have three million people half the population of Hong Kong
<{4> <[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#X412:1:Z>
Seventy million sheep <&>

$A and

$B laughed </&> but they don't take up much space </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-002#413:1:A>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-002#414:1:A>
