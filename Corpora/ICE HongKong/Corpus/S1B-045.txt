The Health Secretary Elizabeth Wong is with us to answer the
critics

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X2:1:Z>
Hello Mrs Wong </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#3:1:A>
Hello Good evening

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X4:1:Z>
Why was no action taken two years ago </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#5:1:A>
Actually uh we have always uh responded to uhm issues and uh
this question of food hygiene has been the subject of stepped up surveillance
over the years <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#6:1:A>
And I  ' d like to respond to this criticism that we have been
treating the restaurant owners unfairly

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#7:1:A>
I think uh uhm in the in this question on this question of public
health <,> it is everybody  ' s business to pull together and to be responsible
for uhm our own health as it were <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#8:1:A>
And in Hong Kong we have uhm a very good infrastructure whereby
there is very close collaboration and collective collaboration between Hong
Kong Government <,> departments like the Health Department the Department of
uhm uh Lands and the Anti-pollution

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#9:1:A>
We have uh environmental control

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#10:1:A>
We have uhm various agencies

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#11:1:A>
We have the municipal councils

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#12:1:A>
So it straddles uh you know an issue to tackle the issue at source
it straddles a number of areas where collaboration is very important <,> and
uhm it does involve very prompt action

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#13:1:A>
Whenever there is a problem like uh uhm for instance this year we
have been stepping up our vigilance uhm our what we call epidemiological
surveillance <,> ever since May <,> and it is because of the effort that we
have put in that we have controlled the effort at source

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#14:1:A>
We  ' ve detected the problem before it really gets worse <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#15:1:A>
So in the Hong Kong situation the uhm uh the massive cooperation
<,> is something which uhm indicates Hong Kong spirit as it were

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#16:1:A>
<{> <[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X17:1:Z>
<[> But there  ' s been all </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#18:1:B>
Mrs Wong this is not a a new problem you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#19:1:B>
As uh Denise uh pointed out it was a problem two years ago and in
fact it  ' s been a problem for many many years <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#20:1:B>
And you  ' ve been in your job now for five or six years <{> <[> <,,>
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#21:1:B>
In uh during that time what have you personally done about <{> <[>
this issue </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#22:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#23:1:A>
<[> Four years yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#24:1:A>
<[> Actually </[> </{> uhm the cholera uh <unc> two-words
</unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#25:1:A>
Well okay

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#26:1:B>
Not not just not just cholera

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#27:1:B>
Pollution problem

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#28:1:A>
Pollution problem we have been party to the cleaning up of the
Hong Kong Harbour <,> and it does require long term aggressive uh solution
such as uhm clean up the whole harbour through the sewage master plan <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#29:1:A>
And I think uh it is not a question of tackling the problem from
the health angle <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#30:1:A>
It is tackling the problem not only from the health angle but
because of the good health <.> re </.> requirement tackling the problem from
the environmental pollution angle <,> and it requires only uhm a dedicated
effort from all parties concerned

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#31:1:A>
Now I  ' d like to go back to your problem regarding your what you  ' ve
said about cholera <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#32:1:A>
It is uh every year we have cholera

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#33:1:A>
Last year we have thirty cases of it because it  ' s endemic in this
part of the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#34:1:A>
It  ' s endemic in India in Bangkok in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#35:1:A>
We have travellers coming back from uhm places overseas and they
have cholera

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#36:1:A>
But we because of this because Hong Kong is a city <,> we have very
good clean water <,> and we have very good infrastructural and health
facilities

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#37:1:A>
Uhm it is because of this we can control the spread of cholera with
great uh <{> <[> efficiency </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#38:1:B>
What with due respect I I don't think you  ' ve answered Denise  ' s
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#39:1:B>
Uh you know this issue of uh restaurants using contaminated water
came up two years ago <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#40:1:B>
Why did you not do anything about it

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#41:1:A>
I have we have uh tried to persuade a number of uhm uhm
relevant authorities to look at the quality of uh water in water tank

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#42:1:A>
And also we have always put up uhm uh notices and uh warnings that
the Hong Kong Harbour is very polluted

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#43:1:A>
And because of that the Environmental Pollution Department has uh
before we embark on any project has undertaken what we call environmental
impact study

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#44:1:A>
And I think we are uhm over-reacting to the situation when we say
because of cholera and therefore everything else has gone wrong

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#45:1:A>
Uhm we don't buy that

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#46:1:A>
What we have said and we will continue to say <,> is this <,> that
uhm health issue requires the collaboration from individuals the relevant
authorities

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#47:1:A>
And this time we <.> ar </.> we are tackling the problem at source
from two issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#48:1:A>
Now first of all live fish and live seafood is kept in uhm water in
tank and there are many ways of purifying water in tank

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#49:1:A>
<{> <[> <,> Uh </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X50:1:Z>
<[> But Mrs Wong </[> </{> I  ' m sorry to interrupt

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X51:1:Z>
But isn't it ludicrous to expect restaurants to uh have the onus
on keeping the tanks clean

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X52:1:Z>
How are they suppose to learn </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#53:1:A>
Well we have got uh restaurants themselves uh very pro-active
in keeping the fish tanks clean because if you can <.> kee </.> keep the fish
tanks clean in many ways <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#54:1:A>
Many people keep fish at home even <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#55:1:A>
You can use commercial salt <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#56:1:A>
You can use uhm uhm many uh other methods like ultraviolet light
<,> to you know to to purify the water <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#57:1:A>
The fish itself is alright

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#58:1:A>
The seafood itself is okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#59:1:A>
It can be eaten

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#60:1:A>
I  ' ve been eating seafood

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#61:1:A>
I  ' ve been eating seafood every day but it is the quality of water
that is very much uhm this the the issue here <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#62:1:A>
And also it is the question of personal hygiene

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#63:1:A>
It  ' s a question of food preparation because let  ' s I think we are
concentrating too much on seafood here because cholera can be spread through
other means as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#64:1:A>
In our in our public education we  ' ve always said <,> prepare food
whether it is seafood or fresh vegetables prepare the food carefully <,> and
cook them thoroughly

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#65:1:A>
<[> And that is the way </[> to prevent <?> it </?>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X66:1:Z>
<[> But it is the polluted </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X67:1:Z>
It  ' s the polluted water which is the problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X68:1:Z>
Shouldn't shouldn't it be the suppliers who are legislated against
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#69:1:A>
Ah we are also uhm uh stopping the suppliers from getting
water at the five uh dirty spots what we call the environmental polluted
spots and they have shown absolute willingness in cooperating with us

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X70:1:Z>
But the measures are not strong enough are they

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X71:1:Z>
People can get round fences </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#72:1:A>
Ah but if there is a question of voluntary restraint uhm then
obviously people won't be stupid enough to fish water in a dirty situation

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#73:1:A>
So I think uh they  ' ve shown willing and they  ' ve shown
collaborative spirit to cooperate with government and I have absolute
confidence that uh we  ' ve got the <.> cob </.> problem under absolute control
<&> recording-fades </&> uh uhm uh a week ago and the nine people are in uhm
who are still in hospital are in very good condition <{> <[> are in
satisfactory condition </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#74:1:B>
<[> You <,> you were saying </[> </{> that people are
concentrating too much on seafood

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#75:1:B>
And yet think I think as </&> you are not taking any action in
nineteen ninety-two the uh number of seafood poisoning cases went up ninefold
from nineteen ninety-two to nineteen ninety-three <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#76:1:B>
What do you have to say about that

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#77:1:A>
I think uh again seafood has got to be very carefully uhm
prepared <,> and we have always concentrated that uhm on <.> t </.> on the
fact that the water round the uhm the sewage outfall and in the harbour is
polluted

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#78:1:A>
We have no not made no bones about that and we I think in the uhm
longer term we need to be very aggressive uh regarding our plan for uh
getting the harbour clean

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#79:1:A>
I think that is the ultimate solution <{> <[> to that

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#80:1:A>
But of course </[> that requires time

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#81:1:A>
In the meantime we  ' ll do what we can <,> to uh arrest the problem
at source

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#82:1:B>
<[> Uh I I think that </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#83:1:B>
Why did the government allow the situation to deteriorate to the uh
uh current time when the harbour in effect has become a cesspool

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#84:1:A>
Uh I think uhm well this is something I think is a very valid
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#85:1:A>
I think the harbour should have been cleaned up long time ago

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#86:1:B>
And what  ' s your answer

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#87:1:A>
Ah

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#88:1:A>
It is and in fact early implementation of uh sewage uhm <{> <[>
master plan because you see you can't look backwards

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#89:1:A>
Looking backwards won't help the won't help the problem </[>

<$B> <[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#90:1:B>
What what what what uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#91:1:B>
No no no no no no

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#92:1:B>
I think one has to look

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#93:1:B>
No I think one has to look

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#94:1:B>
</[> </{> One has to look backward to see how the situation came
about <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#95:1:B>
Uh And you have to hold the government accountable

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#96:1:B>
And just saying uh don't look backward I think is no solution at
all <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#97:1:B>
How did things get to this point

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#98:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#99:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#100:1:A>
You mean the sewage <{> <[> or </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#101:1:B>
<[> The </[> </{> the harbour the typhoon shelters

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#102:1:B>
How did they get to this point

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#103:1:A>
Well it  ' s a historical uh uhm <{> <[> development <?> you
can tell </?> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#104:1:B>
<{> <[> Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#105:1:B>
Isn't it </[> </{> neglect on the part of the government

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#106:1:A>
I think the government could have been much more uhm again as
I said aggressive in cleaning up the harbour and getting much more uhm uh
comprehensive and early implementation of the sewage <{> <[> master plan </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#107:1:B>
<[> But why is it that the government </[> </{> of which you
have been a part for many years always procrastinate until there  ' s a crisis

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#108:1:A>
Well I wouldn't use this as a crisis

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#109:1:A>
I mean <O> laugh </O> I I think this is a problem

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#110:1:A>
It is an issue which we tackle

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#111:1:A>
The fact that we tackle the problem doesn't make it necessarily a
crisis

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#112:1:A>
I think we  ' re sending the wrong message outside Hong Kong because
I was in Finland at the time when the so-called crisis came up and I heard it
from London airport that there  ' s a cholera <,> scare in Hong Kong but when I
came back it  ' s already under very good control

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#113:1:A>
So let us get the problem in proportion <,> and I think let us
also uhm adopt a much more sort of rational attitude towards treating the
problem in this right way

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#114:1:A>
I think the measures so far adopted by the government is both
appropriate to the circumstances and it is very immediate and I think we  ' ve
seen the results

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#115:1:A>
<{> <[> We  ' ve </[> seen the results

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X116:1:Z>
<[> <.> M </.> </[> </{> Mrs Wong what  ' s your message to the
public who are probably totally confused about whether they should eat
seafood or not

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X117:1:Z>
You say you eat it

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#X118:1:Z>
Isn't that being irresponsible <{> <[> to you say eat it </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#119:1:A>
<[> I think so </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#120:1:A>
Because I think it is not the seafood which is in danger it is
the environment which keeps the seafood

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#121:1:A>
If the food is properly prepared <,> if the personal hygiene is
uhm uhm <,> followed uh then there should be no risk because it  ' s not only
seafood

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#122:1:A>
In the weather such as Hong Kong hot weather uh and because
cholera is endemic and I think we  ' ve got to watch our eating habit and make
sure that all food we eat uhm is uh carefully prepared and uh properly
treated as it were properly cooked <{> <[> <,> but </[> I would say I would
say let us not stop at seafood uhm

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#123:1:A>
But it seafood is not the only thing that we have to watch out

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#124:1:A>
I think it would be a very uh it  ' s it  ' s a fallacy to concentrate
only on seafood

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#125:1:A>
What I am saying is that irrespective whether it is seafood or not
this time of the year we  ' ve got to be very very vigilant over our public
health

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#126:1:A>
And uhm in Hong Kong we have very good infrastructure

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#127:1:A>
We have got good health facilities

<ICE-HK:S1B-045#128:1:A>
And the WHO World Health Organization endorses Hong Kong
Government  ' s actions entirely

<$B>   
 
<ICE-HK:S1B-045#129:1:B>
<[> Are you saying </[> </{> </I>
