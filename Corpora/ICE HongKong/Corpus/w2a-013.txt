<bold> &bullet; Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#3:1>
The tightness in Hong Kong  ' s labour market that had persisted
since late 1986 finally showed signs of easing in the first quarter of 1991 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#4:1>
The Gulf War , high oil prices , and general uncertainty over the
development of the world economy had taken their toll in curtailing
production and employment in the last quarter of 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#5:1>
The swift end to the War in February brought exhilaration and euphoria
, prompting a jump in world stock market prices and consumer confidence .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#6:1>
Overseas economic performance , however , continued to be lacklustre ,
and the Hong Kong economy grew at a moderate year-on-year rate of around 4
per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#7:1>
Employment grew slightly , but with the labour force showing some
growth for the first time in three years , the unemployment rate rose rapidly
, from 1.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 to 1.8 per cent in the first
quarter of 1991 and then to 2.1 per cent in the period from February to April .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#8:1>
The provisional unemployment rate was even higher in March to May and
stood at 2.4 per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#9:1>
While the tightness in the labour market seemed to have been relieved,
the labour market in the first half of 1991 was under stress of another kind .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#10:1>
Labour shortage was frequently represented as the culprit behind the
upsurge in inflation and labour was made to shoulder the cost of fighting
inflation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#11:1>
In 1991 , for the first time since 1983 , civil servants  '  pay rise
fell below inflation &obrack; as measured by the rate of increase of Consumer
Price Index &obrack; A &cbrack; &obrack; CPI &obrack; A &cbrack; &cbrack;
&cbrack; &obrack; Table 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#12:1>
Labour was also made to shoulder the cost of industrial adjustment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#13:1>
For the first time in Hong Kong  ' s history , in March 1991 , a large
public company , the Hong Kong Telecom , laid off hundreds of its workers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#14:1>
Although the lay-off decision was perfectly legal and workers were
compensated , the way the matter was handled was criticized as unduly
high-handed , socially irresponsible , and widely condemned .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#15:1>
Then there was the Trade Descriptions &obrack; Amendment &cbrack;
Bill , scheduled to be enacted on 1 July 1991 , that drew widespread concern
and criticism .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#16:1>
The proposed law would permit garment manufacturers to have the
linking process of America-bound garments conducted outside Hong Kong without
affecting the Hong Kong as country-of-origin status .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#17:1>
Labour union leaders feared that up to 25,000 workers would be
unemployed or underemployed as a result of expected shifting of operations
outside Hong Kong &obrack;<it> South China Morning Post </it> , 12 June 1991
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#18:1>
In short , the first half of 1991 was marked by tense labour-employer
relations not seen in many years . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#19:1>
&bullet; <bold> Inflation amid Rising Unemployment </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#20:1>
What caused the most frustration among the working class people
in the first half of 1991 was the sharp rise in inflation amid rising
unemployment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#21:1>
Inflation , as measured by the year-on-year rate of change CPI
&obrack; A &cbrack; , was running at 10.8 per cent , 11.9 per cent , 12.9 per
cent , and 13.9 per cent respectively in the first four months of the year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#22:1>
Despite rising unemployment and weaker wage increases , rising wages
continued to take the blame as the culprit behind the surging inflation .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#23:1>
While labour shortage and wage pressures were important factors
behind the stubborn inflation in recent years , the surge in inflation in the
first four months of 1991 appeared to be more a result of sharp rises in food
and housing costs and indirect taxes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#24:1>
Table 2 shows the major movements in the CPI &obrack; A &cbrack; in
the first four months of 1991 and those of 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#25:1>
It should be noted that of the nine major components in the CPI
&obrack; not all represented in Table 2 &cbrack; only two components rose
faster than the all-item CPI during the period from December to April .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#26:1>
There were &obrack; a &cbrack; alcoholic drinks and tobacco , and
&obrack; b &cbrack; transportation and vehicles , lending credence to the
claim that indirect taxes and public transportation pricing were behind the
recent surge in prices .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#27:1>
Food and housing costs also rose rapidly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#28:1>
An indication that wage pressures were not important factors in the
current inflation is that over the period from December 1990 to April 1991
the cost of the labour-cost-intensive component in food , namely meals bought
away from home , actually lagged behind the cost of foodstuffs bought from
markets and supermarkets .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#29:1>
Another indication is that the cost of services &dash; another
labour-cost-intensive item &dash; trailed well behind food , housing, and the
overall CPI .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#30:1>
The sharp rise in the unemployment rate , from 1.4 per cent in
September to December 1990 to 2.1 per cent in February to April 1991 , is
consistent with the view that wage pressures were falling .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#31:1>
No wonder labour was immensely frustrated by the commonly expressed
view that labour shortage and wage pressures were to blame for the
acceleration of inflation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#32:1>
The truth , of course , is that while labour shortage and wage
pressures had indeed fuelled inflation in recent years they had become the
scapegoat in the current witch hunt .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#33:1>
The unfortunate fact is that , notwithstanding all the clamour for
Hong Kong being a<it> laissez-faire </it> economy , much of the Hong Kong
economy is regulated or uncompetitive .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#34:1>
Public transportation is a case in point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#35:1>
Inefficient transportation modes are allowed monopoly rights and
permitted to raise prices each year to bailout their inefficiency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#36:1>
Telephone services are provided by one company which is able to
impose internationally high charges in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#37:1>
Hong Kong  ' s supermarket business is also extremely uncompetitive ,
with only two major chains essentially dividing the market between themselves .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#38:1>
With almost all of the territory  ' s food imported it is a mystery
that food prices can surge 6.72 per cent over a four-month period .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#39:1>
In any case food price inflation has very little to do with excessive
demand or labour shortage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#40:1>
The surge in the prices of alcoholic drinks and tobacco , too , had
nothing to do with excessive demand or labour shortage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#41:1>
It was a pure case of indirect tax passthrough .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#42:1>
Housing was the second most important component in the CPI after food .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#43:1>
Its price rose 4.41 per cent over the four-month period .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#44:1>
A reading of the month-to-month rates of change shows that private
sector rents were rising at a slower pace each month up to April .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#45:1>
The intense building activity helped bring more rental units to the
market , and rent increases had slowed down .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#46:1>
In April came the relatively large rental increases in some public
sector estates and rates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#47:1>
Failing to tell the true cause of the current acceleration of
inflation , the government chose to boost local interest rates in May 1991 by
one percentage point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#48:1>
Along with other additional anti-inflation measures , civil service
pay was limited to 10.43 per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#49:1>
The government also called upon other sectors in the economy to
restrain wage increases .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#50:1>
The frustration and anger of labour was brought to a new height .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#51:1>
Sporadic industrial actions in protest occurred . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#52:1>
&bullet; <bold> The Absurdity of the Anti-inflation Measures </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#53:1>
On the surface , nominal interest rates in Hong Kong are low
relative to inflation , suggesting that they should perhaps be raised to
maintain a reasonable positive real interest rate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#54:1>
This argument would be valid for a large and relatively closed
economy , but certainly irrelevant for Hong Kong , which is small and open
and on a &ldquo; linked rate &rdquo; system <it> vis-&aacute;-vis </it> the
U.S. dollar .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#55:1>
For international interest rate arbitrageurs , the local inflation
rate is completely irrelevant .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#56:1>
A 200 basis point gap in the interest rates between the United States
and Hong Kong , combined with virtually nonexistent exchange risk , could
invite an infinite amount of interest arbitrage, putting pressure on the Hong
Kong dollar and hurting credibility about continued adherence to the linked
rate system .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#57:1>
<fnr> 1 </fnr> More important , in 1990 and 1991 , the Hong Kong
economy was anything but overheated &obrack; Table 3 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#58:1>
The interest rate jump was therefore unreasonable on yet another
ground .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#59:1>
Retail sales were weak .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#60:1>
Office rents were falling .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#61:1>
Industrial production was stagnant .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#62:1>
The recent strength of the U.S. dollar also was hurting the
competitiveness of Hong Kong products in the months to come .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#63:1>
The boosting of local interest rates would dampen economic
performance further , leading to a decline in tax revenues .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#64:1>
The irony was that much of the recent inflation was actually the
direct result of increases in indirect taxes in pursuit of higher revenue .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#65:1>
According to Table 4 , employment in both manufacturing and
construction was falling in 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#66:1>
This trend was known to persist well into 1991 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#67:1>
Although employment in the service sector was growing , the growth
was not really due to an expansion in final demand .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#68:1>
The hotel industry is a case in point .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#69:1>
Visitors to Hong Kong for the first four months of 1991 were
1,782,917 , a drop of 4.1 per cent from the previous year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#70:1>
The number of rooms of Hong Kong Tourist Association approved hotels
, however , had risen from 27,231 to 29,105 , or 6.9 per cent between March
1990 and March 1991 , creating positions in the industry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#71:1>
Similarly , the continued development of new towns and housing
estates have created new shopping plazas and restaurants , creating positions
in the restaurant and retail business to serve the local retail market , but
the rise in retail employment does not mean that the retail business was
booming .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#72:1>
To curtail demand as a means of fighting inflation was totally
unwarranted in the circumstances . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#73:1>
This , however , is not to say that inflation is not a problem in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#74:1>
This is only to say that mindless inflation-fighting measures
aggravate the problem of idle capacity , depress the generation of real
income , and thus engender social waste .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#75:1>
Fortunately for Hong Kong , the one-percentage-point jump in interest
rates was reversed on 1 July 1991 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#76:1>
The quick reversal was as unexpected as the jump in the first place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#77:1>
These policy initiatives had caused much confusion and arbitrary
redistribution of income .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#78:1>
The government , however , should be commended for its courage to
make the policy correction . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#79:1>
&bullet; <bold> Inflation Threatens Competitiveness </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#80:1>
Regardless of what the source of inflation is , it will hamper
competitiveness , other things being equal .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#81:1>
As wages and rents rise , even if only nominally , competitiveness
suffers because the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#82:1>
<fnr> 2 </fnr> All cost increases therefore translate into a cost
rise in terms of U.S. dollars .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#83:1>
Fortunately for Hong Kong , wage inflation is not unique to Hong Kong
, and all the other three &ldquo; dragons &rdquo; &dash; South Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan &dash; are facing the same problem of labour shortage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#84:1>
Table 5 shows that all the newly industrializing economies &obrack;
NIEs &cbrack; have very low unemployment rates &semi;

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#85:1>
Table 6 shows that industrial wages in some of the other NIEs ,
particularly South Korea , were surging ahead at an even faster pace than in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#86:1>
Recent exchange rate movements , however, reduced significantly Hong
Kong  ' s relative advantage &obrack; except with respect to Singapore &cbrack;
, and further disproportionate inflation in Hong Kong would hurt
competitiveness more . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#87:1>
One factor in Hong Kong  ' s favour , one that cannot be
overemphasized, is the accessibility to cheap labour and cheap land just
north of the border .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#88:1>
According to one estimate , <quote> &ldquo; wages and factory space
rentals in a typical country in the Pearl River Delta region were recently
only about one-seventh and one-ninth of the corresponding levels in Hong Kong .
&rdquo; </quote> <fnr> 3 </fnr>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#89:1>
Although many Taiwanese manufacturers are investing in Mainland China
and are taking advantage of the same favourable factors , they cannot compare
with Hong Kong entrepreneurs in both scale and intensity .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#90:1>
Locational proximity , an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of
doing business in China obtained from a much longer involvement in the
Chinese economy , combine to give Hong Kong manufacturers a unique advantage.
<X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#X91:1>
<quote> &ldquo; By 1990 , it was reported that nearly 20,000
factories in the Pearl River Delta region were engaged in outward-processing
for Hong Kong companies . &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#92:1>
Combined with the some 7,000 Sino-Hong Kong joint ventures, they
<quote> &ldquo; employed , directly or indirectly , a workforce of over three
million, which was about four times as large as Hong Kong  ' s own
manufacturing workforce. &rdquo; </quote> <fnr> 4 </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#93:1>
Actually , for many manufacturers , outward processing is
dictated by the survival instinct .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#94:1>
As more manufacturers move their production lines north , the
pressure increases for other manufacturers to follow .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#95:1>
For most manufacturers , substituting capital for labour and for land
or shifting into other products poses great risks and may even be impossible
for lack of technical know-how or financing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#96:1>
Maintaining old production lines in Hong Kong also is not viable
because of the higher cost of operation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#97:1>
The Hong Kong Federation of Industries has found that , among 411
firms surveyed in 1990 , 160 firms &obrack; 39 per cent &cbrack; have
operations outside Hong Kong , almost all in China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#98:1>
This outward processing activity helps to relieve the pressure of
labour shortage on the Hong Kong economy , but it also brings a significant
number of Hong Kong belongers into China to work in various capacities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#99:1>
Table 7 shows that an estimated 45,600 people had worked in China in
the twelve-month period previous to the survey in late 1989 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#100:1>
This was down from 52,300 in the previous year , reflecting the
short-term tightening of the labour market in Hong Kong in 1989 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#101:1>
As the tightness is alleviated by the economic slowdown and outward
processing continues to expand , it is expected that the number of Hong Kong
citizens working in China will increase again . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#102:1>
&bullet; <bold> The Need for Importation of Labour as a Safety Valve
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#103:1>
At the time of writing , Hong Kong  ' s unemployment rate for
February to April 1991 had risen to 2.1 per cent &obrack; seasonally adjusted
&cbrack; , up from 1.4 per cent in the last quarter of 1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#104:1>
The provisional unemployment rate for March to May 1991 was even
higher , at 2.4 per cent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#105:1>
The &ldquo; underemployment rate &rdquo; &dash; the percentage of
workers employed involuntarily for less than thirty-five hours per week
&dash; also jumped significantly , from 0.8 per cent in the last quarter of
1990 to 2.1 per cent in the period from February to April .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#106:1>
It appeared that , for the time being , the very tight labour market
situation had become a thing of the past .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#107:1>
There were new calls for suspending of the labour importation scheme .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-013#108:1>
As a matter of fact , the Hong Kong economy in the middle of
1991 was far from being vigorous .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#109:1>
Economic growth had lingered around 2.3 or 2.4 per cent for two
years , and any forecast for economic growth beyond 4 per cent in 1991 is
likely to be overly optimistic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#110:1>
As argued earlier on , part of Hong Kong  ' s labour shortage problem
in recent years is self-inflicted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#111:1>
The development of new towns and the building of more hotels have
already been mentioned .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#112:1>
The expansion of enrolment in tertiary educational institutions is
yet another reason , leading to a fall in the labour force participation for
the post-teen population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-013#113:1>
While all of these developments can be justified in one way or
another and I am not arguing against these developments in general , the
nature of Hong Kong  ' s recent labour shortage should be understood to have
little to do with excess final demand . </p> </I>
