<ICE-HK:W2F-012#6:1>
It is evening now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#7:1>
I can still see the tree out there at the end of the path .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#8:1>
The raining tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#9:1>
I wonder if it still rains . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#10:1>
You didn't think I  ' d come home , did you , Granny ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#11:1>
Well , I did .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#12:1>
I always loved Port Dickson , and this house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#13:1>
It seems a shame it  ' s got to come down , to make way for some hotel .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#14:1>
I don't know where I  ' ll go after I give them the house tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#15:1>
I suppose I  ' ll go back to Singapore , go back to work .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#16:1>
Let me close the windows for you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#17:1>
What a dreadful storm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#18:1>
Look , our poor tree  ' s shaking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#19:1>
There  ' ll be buds all over the path tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#20:1>
You wouldn't think , would you , that one tree could afford to lose
so many buds ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#21:1>
There , much quieter with the window shut , don't you think ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#22:1>
We  ' ll sleep better this way .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#23:1>
Oh Granny , I don't want them to take away the house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#24:1>
I know it has to be done , but I still wish ... oh never mind .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#25:1>
I  ' m sorry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#26:1>
I didn't mean to be cross .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#27:1>
It just seems unfair .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#28:1>
You should understand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#29:1>
You wouldn't let anyone take our tree away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#30:1>
Why do you say the tree  ' s different ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#31:1>
If anything , the house should be more important than a stupid tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#32:1>
You  ' re always saying the tree  ' s so important .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#33:1>

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#34:1>
Sometimes , I don't understand you at all , Grandma . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#35:1>
Raining Tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#36:1>
What a funny name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#37:1>
Trees don't rain .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#38:1>
She said this tree could .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#39:1>
How crazy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#40:1>
I guess she meant well .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#41:1>
It does sort of rain , though .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#42:1>
They must have thought I was crazy when I tried to describe it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#43:1>
I  ' ve always called it a raining tree , even if that is a childish
name .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#44:1>
I should have known they wouldn't understand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#45:1>
Why didn't I keep my mouth shut ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#46:1>
This is a bad storm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#47:1>
I really ought to shut the windows . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#48:1>
Remember the walks we used to take on the beach ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#49:1>
Two miles of black sand .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#50:1>
I  ' d like to go on those walks again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#51:1>
I  ' m sure there isn't a nicer sea than here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#52:1>
Of course , I remember !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#53:1>
I ran all the way down to the beach .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#54:1>
And you kept falling and running , trying to catch me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#55:1>
I was naughty that time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#56:1>
But I was a good girl most of the time , wasn't I ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#57:1>
You said I was .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#58:1>
Why did you scare me so much ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#59:1>
You did , you know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#60:1>
The night Mum and Dad crashed you wouldn't let me go to the car .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#61:1>
You said horrible things about their bodies .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#62:1>
You told me not to cry over them because their ghosts would come back
and eat me if I did .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#63:1>
That was the night you told me about the tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#64:1>
You said the tree ghost would do my crying for me , if I  ' d let it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#65:1>
Granny , you were scary when I was five .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#66:1>
Oh Granny , don't cry now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#67:1>
I just wanted to tell you that a tree can't do my crying for me
forever . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#68:1>
I must sit down .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#69:1>
Last night  ' s show wore me out .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#70:1>
They  ' re all almost too friendly to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#71:1>
Have to be , don't they ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#72:1>
I know I  ' m worth more money than any other model in Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#73:1>
I heard the boss telling that to the top client the other day .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#74:1>
Of course I am !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#75:1>
They don't really think I  ' m going to be even tempered and smiling
all the time , just for the fun of it , do they ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#76:1>
Gosh , I wonder what they  ' d do if they knew what I actually thought
of them ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#77:1>
I  ' m surprised to see the old house in good shape .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#78:1>
I imagined it would have fallen apart by now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#79:1>
The outer staircase felt rickety when I stepped on it this afternoon .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#80:1>
Everything looks fine in here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#81:1>
Well , maybe the mirror  ' s a little rusty around the edges , and
those chairs could stand reupholstering ... what am I worrying for ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#82:1>
This place won't be mine anymore tomorrow .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#83:1>
I feel as if I belong here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#84:1>
This room reminds me of my Singapore flat .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#85:1>
Safe .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#86:1>
Away from the crowds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#87:1>
Why did I come back ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#88:1>
The agent could  ' ve handled the entire sale for me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#89:1>
Why do I think about belonging all the time ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#90:1>
Stupid idea .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#91:1>
No wonder the boss laughed when I asked whether or not I really
belonged to the agency .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#92:1>
I even asked Neil , the English photographer , whether or not he
thought I was beautiful enough to belong to the agency .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#93:1>
For no reason at all , right out of the blue I asked him .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#94:1>
They must think me silly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#95:1>
I wonder if they think I  ' m awfully stuck up because I don't say much ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#96:1>
I can't help that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#97:1>
I think they  ' re too nosey in Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#98:1>
Always asking questions .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#99:1>
Let them keep guessing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#100:1>
Nothing matters as long as I smile right and look beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#101:1>
They did say I was the perfect height , and that I had the perfect
Chinese eyes .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#102:1>
It was in all the magazines : I saw it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#103:1>
I told Uncle and Auntie and my cousins that I was going to be a
model one day , but they didn't believe me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#104:1>
They  ' re stupid .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#105:1>
I don't need to think about them anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#106:1>
Once I get the money from this house , I  ' m going on a trip .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#107:1>
It  ' s about time I went somewhere outside of Singapore or Malaysia .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#108:1>
Perhaps , I  ' ll go to London .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#109:1>
I  ' ve heard they like Oriental models in London .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#110:1>
It must be over two years now that I haven't seen my relatives in
Kuala Lumpur .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#111:1>
I haven't missed them , that  ' s for sure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#112:1>
You would have been proud of me , Grandma .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#113:1>
I did try hard not to let them see me cry .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#114:1>
Sometimes , I thought that didn't make sense .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#115:1>
Then , I  ' d be angry at you for ever making up the tree rule .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#116:1>
Now that I think about it , I do remember when I first felt the
difference .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#117:1>
You wouldn't have like my cousins .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#118:1>
They were nasty .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#119:1>
Why did you make me leave Port Dickson and go to them in Kuala
Lumpur ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#120:1>
Yes , I suppose you  ' re right .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#121:1>
I couldn't have stayed with you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#122:1>
I wanted to , you know .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#123:1>
But as I was saying , the time I guess I began to understand was
when my aunt said my skin was too dark , and that dark skin was ugly on
Chinese girls .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#124:1>
That was the first thing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#125:1>
Then , my cousins began to tease me , and call me monkey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#126:1>
You know how the Chinese always call the Malays monkey ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#127:1>
Well , that  ' s what they called me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#128:1>
Granny , how did you know I  ' d want to cry so much ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#129:1>
Did you know , once my cousins and I were playing during recess at
school .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#130:1>
It was right after I left you , so I must have been nine or ten .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#131:1>
Right there , in the middle of the playground , they told everyone I
was half-person , half-monkey because I had a Malay mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#132:1>
The other Chinese kids all started laughing .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#133:1>
I stood there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#134:1>
I didn't know what to say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#135:1>
I used your tree rule for the first time since I left you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#136:1>
I closed my eyes , and tried to see the tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#137:1>
I saw it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#138:1>
The rough , patchy bark and spreading branches , those funny leaves
, the rounded halves not quite matching .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#139:1>
Then , I heard it , the soft whooshing sound of the buds blowing off
the tree , the hard rain of the buds hitting the path .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#140:1>
The other children stopped laughing when they saw me standing there
with my eyes closed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#141:1>
And they all went away .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#142:1>
After that , I got scared because my cousins went home and told
their mother I was crazy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#143:1>
My aunt tried to get me to tell her what had happened , but I
refused because I knew the tree was none of her business .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#144:1>
I wouldn't have cared about their calling me monkey , except that
they laughed at me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#145:1>
My girl cousin told me once I could never marry a Chinese because I
was half monkey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#146:1>
When I said why not , my aunt said , don't you see , you stupid
monkey , you  ' re too ugly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#147:1>
I was so furious I shouted at my aunt , and told her you always said
I was beautiful just like my mother .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#148:1>
My aunt said you were a crazy old woman .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#149:1>
What I don't understand about you , Grandma , you  ' re Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#150:1>
So how come you think I  ' m beautiful . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#151:1>
It feels good to be off my feet , to be away from the spotlight
and all the people telling me the same nonsense .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#152:1>
How good you look !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#153:1>
What a wonderful job you did !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#154:1>
I wish I had a tan like yours !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#155:1>
I know they say other things about me behind my back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#156:1>
Well , I don't need to worry about them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#157:1>
I  ' ve got it made .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#158:1>
Hadn't really thought about it , but I like not wearing make-up and
stupid designer dresses .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#159:1>
They paint me like a doll , and dress me up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#160:1>
Then , they send me out on the catwalk , or trap me in their cameras .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#161:1>
I feel naked in front of them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#162:1>
Mmmm .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#163:1>
This bed  ' s comfortable .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#164:1>
Nobody believed me , I don't think , when I said I had to come here
to sell my house .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#165:1>
It  ' s fun to surprise people .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#166:1>
Everything  ' s going to work out just fine .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#167:1>
I  ' m only twenty , and I  ' m at the top of my profession with plenty
of money .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#168:1>
What could go wrong ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#169:1>
She was tiny , no more than four feet ten , I  ' d say .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#170:1>
She used to say I shouldn't worry , shouldn't cry ... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#171:1>
... oh you noticed , Granny .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#172:1>
Yes , I still wear it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#173:1>
You didn't mind , did you , that I took it away from the body ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#174:1>
I knew you meant for me to have it .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#175:1>
I remember the first time you showed it to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#176:1>
You said it was a tiny pendant for tiny people like us .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#177:1>
I  ' m five-feet-seven now , Granny , taller than you ever expected me
to be . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#178:1>
You told me the three oval , pale green jade pieces were the
buds from the raining tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#179:1>
I believed you then .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#180:1>
Yet , even after I knew better , I liked to think of those jade
pieces as buds .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#181:1>
You also said the gold setting was a gift from the tree ghost .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#182:1>
You meant the pendant for me . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#183:1>
They were only going to bury that pendant with her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#184:1>
Why shouldn't I have taken it ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#185:1>
I need to get some sleep .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#186:1>
Tired .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#187:1>
Things move fast in Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#188:1>
I like that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#189:1>
Don't have time to worry , or think about silly things .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#190:1>
It  ' s work all the time , seven days a week .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#191:1>
Got to be efficient , professional .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#192:1>
That  ' s what the agency says .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#193:1>
Funny city , Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#194:1>
Even relaxing is fast .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#195:1>
I never stop laughing , dancing , drinking .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#196:1>
Someone gave me marijuana the other night .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#197:1>
Those foreigners !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#198:1>
They have everything .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#199:1>
The English and Australian photographers keep telling me to get out
of Asia .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#200:1>
They say I  ' d do well in the West because I  ' m &ldquo; exotic
&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#201:1>
Who knows ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#202:1>
Singapore  ' s not like Kuala Lumpur .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#203:1>
K.L.  ' s sleepy and old fashioned .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#204:1>

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#205:1>
Singaporeans are more exciting and worldly .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#206:1>
Neil said so .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#207:1>
He should know because he  ' s from London and has seen lots more of
the world than I have .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#208:1>
He said K.L . was a boring city in a boring country , and that if I
knew what was good for me , I  ' d stay away from Malaysia .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#209:1>
Makes sense to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#210:1>
Neil and the others laughed when I said I was going to Port Dickson .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#211:1>
I don't care that it  ' s not a big city here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#212:1>
It  ' s country and quiet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#213:1>
Sometimes , I like quiet .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#214:1>
Half monkey , I mean , Malay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#215:1>
Is it the Chinese half they like ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#216:1>
Neil said Malay girls were sexy , but slow . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#217:1>
I tried to run away from K.L . when I was thirteen .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#218:1>
I  ' m twenty now , Grandma .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#219:1>
All grown up .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#220:1>
I was coming home to you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#221:1>
I had it all figured out : I  ' d get a bus to the station in town ,
and then walk out here .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#222:1>
I didn't think it would be too far because all the villagers walked .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#223:1>
I remembered your telling me villagers never hurried or drove
because they didn't want the rush to upset the ghosts .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#224:1>
I always thought that was funny .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#225:1>
When I was little , I kept imagining all the ghosts being knocked
out of the way by our car . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#226:1>
Yes , I remember .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#227:1>
You asked why I wanted the driver to stop that one time , and I said
the rush of our car was upsetting the ghosts of Mummy and Daddy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#228:1>
You thought I was making that up , and that I was thinking about the
accident .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#229:1>
You made up things all the time .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#230:1>
But let me finish .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#231:1>
I had this big fight with Uncle and Auntie who wouldn't tell me you
were dying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#232:1>
I told them they were letting you die .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#233:1>
I even told them they hated me because of Dad , because he  ' d
married a Malay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#234:1>
I knew they wanted the house , which was why they kept me away from
you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#235:1>
I know they thought I was defiant and stubborn , but they were never
nice to me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#236:1>
My uncle thought it was funny to call me &ldquo; monkey girl .
&rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#237:1>
Granny , I  ' m not a monkey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#238:1>
There  ' s nothing wrong with my being part Malay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#239:1>
Why did they have to think they were so superior ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#240:1>
Anyway , my uncle caught me trying to run away , and he said I
deserved to be beaten .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#241:1>
A beating would have been better than listening to him say our
family was crazy .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#242:1>
He called Dad an alcoholic , saying that  ' s why he crashed the car .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#243:1>
And then he called Mum no better than a whore because she was cheap
enough to be a model .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#244:1>
He said Dad was the craziest of all for marrying a monkey , and
throwing away his money on this big house in Port Dickson .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#245:1>
I hated them , Granny , I hated them .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#246:1>
Most of all , I hated being monkey . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#247:1>
The Singaporean models are all mixed .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#248:1>
They tell me I shouldn't even worry about marrying a Chinese .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#249:1>
Anita says that .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#250:1>
She  ' s smart .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#251:1>
She  ' s a flight hostess for Singapore Airlines , and a part-time
model .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#252:1>
I  ' d love to travel like her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#253:1>
Anita says I ought to marry a foreigner .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#254:1>
Foreigners don't care if you  ' re part monkey , I mean , Malay .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#255:1>
All the girls say Neil likes me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#256:1>
He does seem to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#257:1>
He told me I could easily get a job in London , and said he  ' d use
his connections to help me .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#258:1>
Why do I have to think about all these things ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#259:1>
I don't want to get married .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#260:1>
Singapore  ' s tiring .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#261:1>
It doesn't make me feel beautiful anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#262:1>
I  ' m sure Anita talks about me behind my back .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#263:1>
Someone told me she used to sleep with Neil .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#264:1>
Why should I use Neil  ' s connections ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#265:1>
Maybe he  ' s lying .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#266:1>
Maybe he wants to make fun of me too .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#267:1>
He probably wants to sleep with me , that  ' s all .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#268:1>
Sometimes , I don't like Singapore . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2F-012#269:1>
They don't call me monkey now , Granny .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#270:1>
They wouldn't dare .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#271:1>
You know something funny I heard ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#272:1>
My girl cousin came to Singapore and tried to become a model !

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#273:1>
The agencies wouldn't even look at her .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#274:1>
Auntie and Uncle were furious .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#275:1>
I wish you could come see me at the shows .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#276:1>
Look , I brought you all the newspaper and magazine clippings so
that you could see I  ' m not a monkey anymore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#277:1>
She doesn't mind me coming home .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#278:1>
You know why I came back , don't you ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#279:1>
I can't hide anything from you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#280:1>
Do you think they  ' re lying to me , Granny ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#281:1>
Everyone lies .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#282:1>
They think it  ' s the best way to control you .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#283:1>
Look at these clippings .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#284:1>
They  ' re making me something I  ' m not .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#285:1>
That  ' s no better than being a monkey girl all over again .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#286:1>
Well , I won't do that , Grandma .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#287:1>
Why should I ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#288:1>
I  ' m tired of Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#289:1>
I don't belong there .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#290:1>
Are you comfy , Grandma ?

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#291:1>
I want you to be as comfy as possible .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#292:1>
I  ' ll make some tea , and you can tell me a ghost story .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#293:1>
I  ' m tired of Singapore .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#294:1>
I  ' ve had enough of modelling .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#295:1>
It  ' s silly pretending to be beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#296:1>
Grandma , I  ' m not a monkey .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#297:1>
It  ' s evening now .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#298:1>
I  ' m going to draw the curtains .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#299:1>
I came home to rest , Granny .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#300:1>
Climb into bed with me , like you used to .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#301:1>
Let  ' s pretend , just for tonight , that we never left each other .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#302:1>
Look , Granny , I can see our tree .

<ICE-HK:W2F-012#303:1>
Do you think it  ' ll cry for me tonight ? </p> </I>
