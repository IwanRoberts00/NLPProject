Hi ! Amy &ampersand; Wendy ,
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#2:1>
I just came back from a trip to California .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#3:1>
I had a great time visiting Grand Canyon , Las Vegas Disneyland ,
Universal Studios ..... etc

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#4:1>
It was such a terrific visit ! ! ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#5:1>
What  ' s new with both of you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#6:1>
I wished I had stayed in H.K .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#7:1>
After these years , you and I seem so distant .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#8:1>
I miss you guys !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#9:1>
Take care of yourselves &ampersand; write back soon ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#10:1>
Oh !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#11:1>

P.S. What  ' s new with Rita ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#21:1>
Please say Hello to her !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#22:1>
OK ? ! </I>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#23:2>
Hi ! Amy &ampersand; Wendy

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#24:2>
My trip to the West coast of mainland was great fun !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#25:2>
I visited San Francisco , San Jose , Fresno , Arizona : Grand Canyon
<O> three-Chinese-characters in brackets </O> , Nevada : Las Vegas ,
Hollywood : Disneyland and Universal Studios .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#26:2>
My first impression of L.A. wasn't so good .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#27:2>
It was foggy <-> overthere </-> <+> over there </+> , &obrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#28:2>
I hate the smog <-> overthere </-> <+> over there </+> &cbrack; .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#29:2>
By the way , what  ' s up with you guys ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#30:2>
I guess you  ' re probably dating sweetly in romance ...... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#31:2>
I feel tired with dating and everything which associates with
love

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#32:2>
I  ' ve been making a great effort in keeping myself away from all the
guys .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#33:2>
However , I failed ..... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#34:2>
Recently , I refused the love of Chi-Man , I really don't wanna
hurt him .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#35:2>
I refused him with this excuse : I need to concentrate on my study or
otherwise I would lose my scholarships .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#36:2>
Unfortunately , he didn't give up chasing after me , calling me up
and dating me out ..... </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#37:2>
On my visit to San Francisco , I met my cuz

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#38:2>
They asked me to stay <-> overthere </-> <+> over there </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#39:2>
Well , I guess I  ' d like to join them 2 years later .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#40:2>
Frankly speaking , I do like San Francisco .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#41:2>
It  ' s such a terrific place for me ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#42:2>
It  ' s incredible that the casinos of Las Vegas are situating in
the desert region of Nevada .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#43:2>
You just can't imagine how hot it is ! ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#44:2>
On the days I visited , the temp. was over 45&degree;C

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#45:2>
However , the scenery of Las Vegas is so fascinating that looks like
a paradise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#46:2>
Besides Las Vegas , the Grand Canyon is another place I love so
much .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#47:2>
My first impression of the Canyon was : The magic of nature is so
fantastic ! ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#48:2>
Universal Studios in Hollywood is really a place which enhances
your vision to nowadays technology in film making .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#49:2>
I  ' d never forget the &lsquo; Back to the future ride &rsquo; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#50:2>
I just felt the magic of Hitchcock is wonderful and fantastic </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#51:2>
Gonna stop !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#52:2>
Write back soon !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#53:2>
Love, Janet

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#55:3>
Hello Janet,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#56:3>
I  ' m so glad you , at last , reply my letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#57:3>
As you know , I have waited for your news for half a year already .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#58:3>
I  ' m sorry to know that you have been ill for nearly a month .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#59:3>
But Hawaii is a beautiful place , so pretty that I can't imagine you
can catch a cold in such paradise .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#60:3>
The air is fresh , there is a vast amount of places for you to do
sports as you mentioned before , you went skiing , cycling and swimming .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#61:3>
And Rita told me that you had a very happy life there because many
guys offer you farm , houses to you as presents for engagement ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#62:3>
You said that you took a part-time job at the university ? !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#63:3>
What kind of job is it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#64:3>
Do you work only on Saturdays and Sundays ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#65:3>
How is the pay ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#66:3>
Is it attractive ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#67:3>
Previously , you gave private piano lessons to some Japanese , <del>
did </del> you teach piano now ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#68:3>
As in Hong Kong , the tuition fees for learning piano has increased
tremendously but it  ' s not the case of private tuition .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#69:3>
For learning piano , one has to pay two hundred dollars per hour but
for private tuition , it  ' s only around one hundred or a little more .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#70:3>
So , I prefer teaching piano rather than giving private tuition to
secondary school students .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#71:3>
Janet , if you come back to Hong Kong in June , you can earn quite a
lot within your summer holidays as you can teach piano !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#72:3>
But if you come back in July , you can't earn much and most important
of all , you can't see me !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#73:3>
It  ' s a pity !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#74:3>
Please do return back in June rather than July .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#75:3>
In July , I am going to France to learn French .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#76:3>
Although I have learnt French for two years , the standard is really
low .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#77:3>
I still have problem to speak in French when communicating with my
French classmates and my French pen friend .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#78:3>
I choose to go to France to study French because I  ' d like to meet
her .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#79:3>
Otherwise , I  ' d choose Canada as I  ' ve many relatives living there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#80:3>
How about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#81:3>
Do you still keep in touch with your German pen-friend ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#82:3>
Do you remember that in Form three , Miss Lee persuaded us to have a
pen friend so as to improve our English ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#83:3>
But now you don't need this , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#84:3>
I think you must have many western friends already ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#85:3>
Janet , I have so many news to tell you !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#86:3>
At this moment , I  ' m having Easter holidays but only last for five
days .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#87:3>
During the holidays , I went to Macau with my relatives

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#88:3>
of course , we went to the Casino .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#89:3>
All of us lost money in the Casino !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#90:3>
Poor us ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#91:3>
My sister Wendy did not go to South Africa but she decides to go
there in the summer holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#92:3>
Therefore , Janet , if you come back in July , it  ' s a bit late
because my sister and I are not in HK at that time !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#93:3>
Are you studying the third year at the university ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#94:3>
Then , what are you going to do after graduation ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#95:3>
For me , I don't have any exact plan yet because it  ' s not so easy to
find a job with reasonable salary .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#96:3>
The average salary is only around &dollar;8000 , it  ' s much lower
than a salesgirl in a large boutique or a waitress in a restaurant !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#97:3>
This phenomenon is really odd !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#98:3>
Sometimes , I regret for what I have chosen .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#99:3>
Rita also regrets at this moment , she only applies the job of
Assistant Education Officer of the Education Department !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#100:3>
She is not going to travel Europe as she  ' s very worried to find a
job ! ! ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#101:3>
I have gone through many recruitment tests but all of them were in
vain . <O> a-crying-face </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#102:3>
The tests are really difficult .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#103:3>
They cover the questions of IQ , Maths , grammar , sentence
structures , ... etc .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#104:3>
As you know , I haven't done any Maths exercises for five years ,
even the formula of finding the area of a circle is a big difficulty for me !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#105:3>
I have no hope to find a good job , maybe , being a teacher will be
my career in my life . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#106:3>
I  ' ve talked too much , right ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#107:3>
But I  ' ve to ask you something about your suitor the Taiwanese , is
he a lecturer at your University ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#108:3>
He has the ability to buy Hyatt Hawaii at the age of twenty
something ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#109:3>
It  ' s really unbelievable ! !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#110:3>
I think you like him , don't you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#111:3>
You are lucky to meet such a guy who is rich , handsome ,
so-well-educated , young , ........ let me know if you are both going to
marry ! ! ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#112:3>
Lastly , I  ' d like to tell you that Mr. Lee has opened a &ldquo;
G2000 &rdquo; in Tsuen Wan ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#113:3>
he gives me 20&percent; discount for any purchase !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#114:3>
He also remembers you ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#115:3>
if you come back , let  ' s visit him and buy something at his shop .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#116:3>
He did not teach anymore in <del> and </del> because he  ' d like to
be a <ul> businessman </ul> ha ha !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#117:3>
He told me that he would open another G2000 in the New Territories .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#118:3>
I wonder why he studied Master Degree if he determined to be a
businessman rather than a teacher .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#119:3>
Although his wife has obtained a BBA degree at Chinese University ,
she did not teach anymore .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#120:3>
It  ' s ... so strange ! ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#121:3>
I  ' ve to stop now and I hope you can reply as soon as possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#122:3>
I  ' m going to have exam on 4 May to 16 May and I  ' ve reserved an air
ticket to France &obrack; AIR FRANCE &cbrack; on 26 June .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#123:3>
It  ' s direct flight because my parents are worried about my trip !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#124:3>
They are so anxious !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#125:3>
I plan to be back in mid-August . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#126:3>
Hope to see you soon !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#127:3>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#130:4>
Dearest Pamela,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#131:4>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#132:4>
This is Amy again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#133:4>
I  ' m so glad that you reply my letter .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#134:4>
Now , let me tell you my news . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#135:4>
I received a letter from a Government department .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#136:4>
They ask me to sit for a recruitment test of the post &ldquo; <->
Liasion </-> <+> Liaison </+> Officer &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#137:4>
I like this job very much because the salary is attractive , the
duty is simple , just do the co-ordinating work within various government
departments .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#138:4>
So I hope I can pass the test on 31 March . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#139:4>
My trip to France is annoying because it  ' s difficult to
compromise with my classmates .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#140:4>
We cannot agree on the routes .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#141:4>
It  ' s probably that I  ' ll go to France alone and stay in Paris for a
few days &obrack; <ul> alone </ul> ! ! &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#142:4>
Therefore , I try to find out information about Paris during these
few days . I hope I  ' ll be safe there !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#143:4>
God Bless Me !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#144:4>
I  ' ve been learning French for two years .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#145:4>
But the standard is really bad .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#146:4>
That  ' s why I join the trip . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#147:4>
I hardly see Aunt Maria , Alma , <del> Al </del> Lorraine , Sze
, Kit ..... etc because they  ' re all busy with their work .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#148:4>
Kit and Lorraine takes the public exam this year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#149:4>
On 10 April , I  ' ll have French oral exam but I don't have much
confidence .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#150:4>
Even my spoken English is a problem !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#151:4>
From then on , my graduation exams begin until 16 May .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#152:4>
The exam is quite tightly packed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#153:4>
I hope I can survive after the exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#154:4>
I  ' ll lose weight after the exam .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#155:4>
It  ' s true ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#156:4>
I don't have much more news .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#157:4>
Write back soon .

Dearest Kate ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#163:5>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#164:5>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#165:5>
I am extremely busy at HKU. because the workload is heavy !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#166:5>
Maybe this is my final year ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#167:5>
there are many essays for me to do .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#168:5>
How about you in the University of Leeds ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#169:5>
Are you studying in the second year ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#170:5>
I recall that last week was your birthday ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#171:5>
how do you celebrate ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#172:5>
In may , I  ' ll finish my exams .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#173:5>
And in late June , I  ' ll go to France to study French .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#174:5>
At first , I plan to leave France on mid-August but I  ' d like to ask
you that is it possible for me to meet you in London if I change my place of
departure .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#175:5>
That is , I leave at London Airport rather than the airport in Paris .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#176:5>
I want to see you after writing to you for eight years ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#177:5>
if it  ' s possible then can you take me travel around .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#178:5>
I won't stay in London very long , maybe 1/2 day because it depends
on your decision .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#179:5>
If you can meet me and stay with you , I can stay in <&>
two-missing-sentence-fragments-due-to-unclear- photocopying </&> come to
Britain

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#180:5>
Please let me know whether you can meet me at the &lsquo; Dover
&rsquo; pier / London Airport .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#181:5>
Also , can you give me your telephone number .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#182:5>
I really want to meet you ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#183:5>
if you are busy , then can we meet just several hours ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#184:5>
Several hours also make me very pleased then . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#185:5>
Now , I give you my telephone number 7441251.

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#186:5>
You can phone me if you have any inquires about my trip.

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#187:5>
I hope that I can receive your reply as soon as possible maybe early
April .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#188:5>
This is really urgent and I  ' m looking for your favourite replies.

Dear Isabelle ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#194:6>
How are you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#195:6>
I am very happy now because my exam was over . <O> a-smiling-face
</O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#196:6>
Have your school exam started yet ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#197:6>
It had been a tough time to me because I was very lazy and did
not do much revision .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#198:6>
Therefore , before the exam came , I had to study very very hard to
cover what I had learned in the whole year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#199:6>
I hope I will get <del> a </del> good result . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#200:6>
<del> one-character </del> I am now working in the Hong Kong
Sports Development Board as a summer helper .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#201:6>
My job duties are to extract minutes , arrange time schedule and
assign jobs for the messengers .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#202:6>
It is indeed a very boring job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#203:6>
Luckily , the employees there are very nice and friendly .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#204:6>
and I am <del> ve <del> happy to work &plus; play with them . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#205:6>
When will your summer holiday start ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#206:6>
How do you plan to spend it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#207:6>
Please <del> 2-characters </del> tell me next time.

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#208:6>
Time to stop .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#216:7>
It is now July and July and Autumn are the two hottest months in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#217:7>
<del> It is </del> The temperature always reaches or even <del>
one-character </del> more than 30&degree;C .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#218:7>
People wear very thin clothes and when you walk in the streets , you
will think <del> a-character </del> you are having sauna !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#219:7>
Anyway , I believe summer is the most favourite season for the men
in Hong Kong because there are many women who wear little and they are very
sexy ! ! <O> smiling-face </O> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#220:7>
I go to swim every Sunday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#221:7>
Although the swimming pool is very crowded , I enjoy the feeling in
water .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#222:7>
Sometimes I go with my friends but sometimes I go alone .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#223:7>
Although I love swimming , I do not excel in it . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#224:7>
<del> Do </del> Will you go to other countries in this summer
holiday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#225:7>
I won't because my contract ends on 31st Aug .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#226:7>
Time to stop .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#227:7>
Bye Bye ! ! <O> crying-face </O>

Dear Isabelle ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#230:8>
Merry Christmas !

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#231:8>
I hope you like my Christmas card .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#232:8>
I am having my term break .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#233:8>
and so I don't have to go to school until January .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#234:8>
I spend most of my time sleeping because I feel extremely tired
after the 1st semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#235:8>
I also go to see movies and drama.

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#236:8>
Drama is beginning to gain popularity in Hong Kong and the tickets
are always sold out .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#237:8>
Thus , you have to be quick to go to buy tickets .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#238:8>
The fare is reasonable and <del> I </del> students and the elderly
have discount .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#239:8>
<del> one-character </del> sometimes up to 50&percent; ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-003#240:8>
Most of the shops are on sale now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#241:8>
And they are jammed with people looking for low-priced clothes and
shoes .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#242:8>
Is it the same in France ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#243:8>
I have <del> boung </del> bought many shirts because the price is
reasonable now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#244:8>
When the shops are not on sale , they always mark up the price <del>
three-characters </del> very high .

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#245:8>
Therefore , I seldom buy in this time because I <del> feel I am
</del> have the feeling that I am cheated ! </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-003#246:8>
I hope you enjoy your Christmas and have a Happy New Year ! ! <O>
smiling-face </O>
