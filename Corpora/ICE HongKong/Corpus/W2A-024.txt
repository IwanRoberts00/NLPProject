Prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#4:1>
Two large-scale population-based epidemiological studies that used
the 1985 World Health Organization &obrack;  WHO &cbrack; diagnostic criteria for diabetes
mellitus were performed in Hong Kong in 1990 <sp> 1 </sp> and 1995. <sp> 2
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#5:1>
The earlier study involved 1513 subjects who were recruited from two
workforces aged between 28 and 65 years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#6:1>
The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes mellitus was found to be
7.7&percent; , whereas the crude prevalence ranged from less than 1&percent;
in subjects younger than 30 years to more than 20&percent; in the middle-aged
group. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#7:1>
The 1995 population-based survey involved 2900 subjects who were aged
between 25 and 74 years , and showed an age-adjusted prevalence of
8.5&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#8:1>
The crude prevalence ranged from 1.7&percent; in the 25-to-34-year
age-group to more than 25&percent; in those older than 65 years. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#9:1>
Due to different sampling methods , these figure are not directly
comparable; nevertheless , they support an overall rising trend in the
age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#10:1>
In both studies , only 30&percent; of diabetes subjects had been
previously diagnosed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#11:1>
The body mass index &obrack;  BMI &cbrack; , waist to hip ratio , a family history of
diabetes , and an older age were independent predicators of diabetes
mellitus. <sp> 1,2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#12:1>
There were also close associations between glucose intolerance ,
dyslipidaemia &obrack;  high levels of triglyceride and low levels of high-density
lipoprotein &obrack;  HDL]-cholesterol &cbrack; , obesity , hyperinsulinaemia , albuminuria ,
and high blood pressure in these subjects. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#13:1>
These findings suggest that diabetes mellitus in the Hong Kong
Chinese population is often part of a multifaceted syndrome , commonly known
as the  ' metabloic syndrome'. <sp> 4 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#14:1>
Using statistical modeling , most of the components of the syndrome
can be explained by obesity , family history , and increased age. <sp> 4
</sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#15:1>
Prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#16:1>
Individuals have impaired glucose tolerance &obrack;  IGT &cbrack; if they fail
to maintain a normal plasma glucose &obrack;  PG &cbrack; concentration 2 hours after a
glucose load , but their PG levels do not reach values in the diabetic range
( ie fasting PG , <7 mmol/L and 2-hour PG ,  7.8-11.1 mmol/ L &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#17:1>
Similar to the local trend in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus ,
the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance &obrack;  IGT &cbrack; has increased markedly ,
from 7&percent; in both men and women in 1990 <sp> 5 </sp> to 14&percent; in
men and 17&percent; in women in 1995. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#18:1>
As with Caucasians, <sp> 6,7 </sp> Hong Kong Chinese people with ICT
have an increased number of cardio-vascular risk factor. <sp> 8,9 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#19:1>
For example , the prevalence of hypertension in 1990 was 7.5&percent;
, 23.9&percent; , and 15&percent; in Hong Kong Chinese men with normal
glucose tolerance , IGT , and diabetes , respectively; in women , the
corresponding figures were 3.4&percent; , 8.7&percent; , 14&percent;. <sp> 3
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#20:1>
Retinopathy <sp> 10 </sp> and albuminuria <sp> 3 </sp> have also been
observed in Chinese subjects with IGT .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#21:1>
Three large-scale population-based studies of Caucasians have found
clear relationships between the fasting PG level and mortality , even in non-
diabetic people. <sp> 11 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#22:1>
In a typical cohort of subjects with risk factors for diabetes
mellitus &obrack;  usually a positive family history or a history of gestational
diabetes mellitus &cbrack; , 50&percent; of those with IGT progressed to develop
diabetes mellitus in 4.34 years , giving a crude annual conversion rate of
11.6&percent;. <sp> 12 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#23:1>
The 2-hour post-glucose loading PG level was the major predicator of
the progression of glucose intolerance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#24:1>
For those with a 2-hour PG level of = 10.1 mmol/L , the progression
from IGT to diabetes mellitus was three times faster than for those with a
2-hour PG level of <10.1 mmol/L.  <sp> 12 </sp> </p> <h> <it> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#25:1>
Prevalence of obesity and its relationships with cardiovascular risk
factors </bold> </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#26:1>
The WHO defines overweight as a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m <sp>
2 </sp> , and obesity as a BMI of = 30 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> in Caucasians. <sp>
13 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#27:1>
The National Diabetes Data Group , however , defines obesity as a BMI
of = 25 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> in Caucasian women and = 27 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> in
men. <sp> 14 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#28:1>
Based on the WHO criteria , the prevalence of overweight in the Hong
Kong Chinese population increased from the 28&percent; &obrack;  in 1990 &cbrack; to
36&percent; &obrack;  in 1995 &cbrack; and that of obesity from 3&percent; to 6&percent;.
<sp> 1,2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#29:1>
In the 1990 survey , however , the mean BMI of Hong Kong men and
women of working age was 23 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> , whereas the mean BMI of
diabetes individuals was 24 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> . <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#30:1>
Hence , when the WHO definitions are applied to Asian populations ,
whose body frame are generally smaller than those of Caucasians , they are
often erroneously considered to be non-obese. <sp> 15 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#31:1>
The International Obesity Task Force recently recommended the
following weight for Asians according to BMI value: overweight , = 23 kg/m
<sp> 2 </sp> ; at-risk , 23 to 24.9 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> ; obese I , 25 to 29.9
kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> ; and obese II , > 30 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#32:1>
Despite the differences in adiposity indices between Chinese and
Caucasian populations , there are continuous relationships between
anthropometric measurements-in particular , waist circumference-and
cardiovascular risk factor in the Hong Kong Chinese population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#33:1>
The threshold BMI value taken to indicate cardiovascular risk factors
such as diabetes , hypertension , or dyslipidaemia has been shown to be
approximately 24 kg/m <sp> 2 </sp> in both Hong Kong men and women. <sp> 16
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#34:1>
Taken together , the cardiovascular risks associated with blood
pressure , and blood lipid and blood glucose levels, <sp> 17 </sp> and
obesity represent a continuum , and their interactions are more important tan
absolute values. <sp> 15,17-19 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#35:1>
Mortality and morbidity of type 2 diabetes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#36:1>
In 1989 , we examined the clinical characteristics of 493
consecutive Hong Kong Chinese patients attending a hospital diabetes clinic.
<sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#37:1>
Less than 3&percent; of the patients had classical type 1 diabetes
mellitus , defined as acute presentation with either diabetic ketoacidosis or
heavy ketonuria &obrack;  > 3+ &cbrack; or continuous requirement of insulin within 1 year of
diagnosis .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#38:1>
However , 25&percent; of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
received insulin treatment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#39:1>
Among the study population , 50&percent; had hypertension ,
50&percent; had increased albuminuria , and 50&percent; had dyslipidaemia .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#40:1>
In type 1 diabetes there are close relationships between hypertension
, proteinuria , and retinopathy .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#41:1>
However , these relationships are usually less consistent in the type
2 disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#42:1>
For example , in Chinese with type 2 diabetes mellitus , 60&percent;
to 80&percent; of patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria had
hypertension .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#43:1>
However , 40&percent; of the normalbuminuric patients also had
hypertension thus suggesting that essential hypertension often coexists with
type 2 diabetes. <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#44:1>
These findings emphasise the heterogeneous nature in the clustering
of these risk factors in Chinese patients . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#45:1>
Approximately 30&percent; of patients admitted to Hong Kong
public hospitals with stroke, <sp> 21,22 </sp> acute myocar-dial infarction,
<sp> 23 </sp> and heart failure <sp> 24 </sp> in the early 1990s were found
to also have diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#46:1>
Many cases of diabetes were diagnosed only as the result of these
diabetic complications .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#47:1>
Until recently , 30&percent; of diabetic patients showed clinical
evidence of retinopathy when they were first referred to hospital .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#48:1>
The recent reduction of this figure to less than 10&percent; in the
past 2 to 3 years has been attributed to an increased awareness and earlier
referral of patients to hospital clinics. <sp> 25,26 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#49:1>
Between 30&percent; and 40&percent; of Hong Kong Chinese patients
receiving dialysis had diabetes during 1995 to 1999, <sp> 27 </sp> and many
were not enrolled into the renal replacement programme because of concurrent
medical problems such as visual loss or stroke .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#50:1>
Despite receiving dialysis , these patients often have a reduced
survival rate and poor quality of life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#51:1>
In a 1990msurvey , drug-induced hypoglycaemia , mainly due to oral
drugs , was the main cause of hospital admissions to treat adverse drug
events .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#52:1>
Impaired renal function and old age were the major predisposing
factors. <sp> 28 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#53:1>
In a local prospective study involving 400 type 2 diabetic
patients followed up for a mean period of 26 months , the annual mortality
rate was found to be 3.5&percent; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#54:1>
The majority of deaths were due to cardio-vascular disease &obrack;  mainly
stroke &cbrack; and renal failure. <sp> 29 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#55:1>
The independent predicators of death were the fasting PG level and
albuminuria .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#56:1>
In this study , a spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio &obrack;  ACR &cbrack; of
5.6 to 38.0 mg/mmol corresponded to a 24-hour urinary albumin excretion of 30
to 30 mg/d .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#57:1>
These higher cut-off values might have been because of the lower body
mass of the Hong Kong Chinese population .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#58:1>
The relative risk of death was 3.7 in patients with microalbuminuria
and 11 in those with macroalbuminuria &obrack;  ACR = 38 mg/mmol &cbrack; when compared with
the normoalbuminuric patients . <sp> 29 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#59:1>
In another cohort of 102 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus who were followed up for a mean period of 5.5 year , 50&percent; of
patients with macro-albuminuria &obrack;  24-hour urinary albumin excretion , = 300
mg/d on at least two occasions &cbrack; had at least one clinical end-point , which
was defined either as death , significant cardiovascular disease , or renal
failure. <sp> 30 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#60:1>
There are also close relationships between albuminuria and the
rate of deterioration of renal function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#61:1>
By using multivariate analysis , the fasting PG level , the glycated
haemoglobin HbA <sb> lc </sb> level , albuminuria , a high total cholesterol
and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were found to be independent
predicators of clinical events. <sp> 30 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#62:1>
Apart from the duration of disease , and metabolic and blood pressure
control , genetic factors have also been implicated in the development of
diabetic complications. <sp> 31 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#63:1>
In the Hong Kong Chinese population , the Z-2 allele-an &obrack;  AC &cbrack; <sb> n
</sb> dinucleotide repeat upstream to the aldose reductcase gene-has been
shown to be associated with severe retinopathy in young patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus. <sp> 32 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#64:1>
The angiotensinogen M235T &obrack;  TT &cbrack; genotype and its possible interaction
with the angiotensin converting enzyme deletion/insertion polymorphisms &obrack; 
DI/DD &cbrack; have also been reported in Chinese diabetic patients who have
increased albuminuria. <sp> 33 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#65:1>
However , these findings need to be reproduced in other patient
populations and their clinical significance requires prospective evaluation .
</p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#66:1>
Childhood diabetes </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#67:1>
In Caucasians , autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus is the main
form of diabetes in young patients and the diagnosis is unlikely to be missed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#68:1>
In contrast , the type 1 disease remains uncommon in most
non-Caucasian population, <sp> 34 </sp> even among Chinese children or
patients with a young onset of the disease &obrack;  younger than 35 years). <sp> 20
</sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#69:1>
Epidemiological studies performed in Hong Kong and mainland China
have revealed that there is a wide variation of incidence rates of type 1
diabetes within the Chinese population; the highest rate was found in Hong
Kong &obrack;  overall annual incidence , 2 per 100000). <sp> 35,36 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#70:1>
The incidence rate of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in
Chinese children are increasing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#71:1>
Currently , 10&percent; to 15&percent; of cases of childhood diabetes
in Hong Kong are type 2 diabetes mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#72:1>
Most of the young patients are adolescent with a strong family
history of the disease &obrack;  G Wong , written communication , 2000 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#73:1>
The high prevalence of childhood obesity &obrack;  > 120&percent; of the
reference mean of body weight for a certain height &cbrack; is 10&percent; to
14&percent; in Hong Kong children, <sp> 37,38 </sp> and the incidence of type
2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents and young adults is expected to increase
further . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#74:1>
Autoimmune status in patients with young-or acute-onset diabetes
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#75:1>
In 1990 , 28&percent; of adults who attend the Prince of Wales
Hospital Diabetes Clinic were shown to have diabetes before the age of 35
years .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#76:1>
Among these patients , only 10&percent; had classical type 1 diabetes
mellitus , of which 50&percent; received insulin treatment. <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#77:1>
In two separate cohorts of patients with either acute - <sp> 39 </sp>
or early-onset diabetes, <sp> 40 </sp> antibodies to glutamic acid
decarboxylase &obrack;  GAD &cbrack; , a marker for autoimmunity , were found in only
10&percent; to 30&percent; of patients , depending on the acuteness of their
modes of presentation and insulin secretory status .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#78:1>
Patients with an earlier onset of disease also tended to have a
higher detection rate of anti-GAD antibodies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#79:1>
These findings suggest that although autoimmune destruction of ß
cells remains a rare event in the local population , it may adopt a more
important role in patients with early-onset disease .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#80:1>
A similar form of slow-onset autoimmune diabetes has also been
reported in Caucasians. <sp> 41 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#81:1>
In patients with type 1 presentation , there was also
heterogeneity of pancreatic ß-cell function: only 75&percent; of patients
were classified as being truly insulin deficient, <sp> 39 </sp> as determined
by either basal &obrack;  <0.2 nmol/L &cbrack;  <sp> 42 </sp> or post-glucagon-stimulated
plasma C-peptide levels &obrack;  <0/6 nmol/L).  <sp> 43 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#82:1>
Despite presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis , some patients no
longer required insulin at a later stage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#83:1>
Although these patients did not have antibodies against GAD , they
had severe to moderate insulin deficiency , based on C-peptide level , which
suggests that they may eventually require insulin treatment. <sp> 44,45 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#84:1>
A similar form of diabetes , sometimes known as'type 1 1/2 ' or  ' flatbush
diabetes ' has also been described in African Americans. <sp> 46 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#85:1>
The acute presentation in these patients might be related to the
effects of severe hyperglycaemia on insulin resistance and pancreatic ß-cell
function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#86:1>
Our findings suggest that , as with childhood type 1 diabetes
mellitus , both acute-and young-onset diabetes in the Hong Kong Chinese
population are heterogeneous conditions in which autoimmunity remains an
uncommon cause . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#87:1>
In our 1990 survey , we reported that younger patients had a
higher prevalence of a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity
than patients whose disease started later in life. <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#88:1>
Since 1995 , all patients attending the Prince of Wales Hospital
Diabetes Clinic undergo comprehensive assessment modified from the Europe
DiabCare protocol. <sp> 47 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#89:1>
In 1997 , the database consisted of more than 3000 patients ,
28&percent; of whom were diagnosed whom were diagnosed before the age of 35
years at the time of assessment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#90:1>
Among these young patients , 56&percent; had a family history of
diabetes , compared with 45&percent; in the older-onset group. <sp> 48 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#91:1>
In addition , 1&percent; of these index patient had members of three
successive generations affected by diabetes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#92:1>
In agreement with reports in other populations , patients who had a
positive family history of diabetes were more likely to have a maternal
history of the disease. <sp> 49,50 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#93:1>
These findings emphasise the importance of genetic factors ,
especially inpatients with a young onset of disease . </p> <h> <bold>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#94:1>
Genetic heterogeneity of patients with maturity-onset diabetes of
youth </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#95:1>
Our findings suggest that some young patients in Hong Kong might
have maturity-onset diabetes of youth &obrack;  MODY), <sp> 51 </sp> which is a
mongenic form of diabetes that is characterised by autosomal dominant
inheritance , early onset &obrack;  usually before 25 years of age &cbrack; , and a primary
defect in pancreatic ß-cell function .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#96:1>
This form of diabetes can result from mutations in at least five
different genes-namely , those encoding glucokinase; the hepatocyte nuclear
factors , HNF-1a , HNF-1ß , and HNF-4a; and insulin promoter factor 1 &obrack; 
IPF-1). <sp> 52-56 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#97:1>
In a cohort of 92 unrelated Chinese patients with the familiar
form of early-onset type 2 diabetes , direct sequencing revealed mutations
in the genes encoding glucokinase and the transcription factor HNF-1a genes
in three &obrack;  3&percent; &cbrack; and five &obrack;  5&percent; &cbrack; patients , respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#98:1>
No mutations were found in the coding region of the HNF-4a gene .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#99:1>
The three mutations found in the glucokinase gene were novel missense
mutations that corresponded to amino acid changes I110T , A119D , and G385V .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#100:1>
The mutations found in the HNF-1a gene also represented new
mutations and included four missense mutations &obrack;  G20R , R203 , S432C , and
I618M &cbrack; and one splice acceptor site mutation &obrack;  IVS2nt-IG?A &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#101:1>
Despite the cosegregation of mutations with diabetes in one of these
families , two siblings presented with severe complications due to delayed
diagnosis while the other two siblings &obrack;  who had need diagnosed by screening)
remained free of complications after 10 years of disease. <sp> 57-59 </sp>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#102:1>
Among a cohort of 150 young patients with a family history of
diabetes , 3&percent; had an A?G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA encoding
tRNA <sp> Leu(UUR &cbrack; </sp> at position 3243 and 2&percent; had an A?G mutation
in the amylin gene .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#103:1>
In addition , antibodies to GAD were present in 4&percent; of the
young patients. <sp> 60 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#104:1>
The presence of these gene mutations and autoimmune markers is
associated with a reduced insulin secretion and is likely to have contributed
to MODY either directly or indirectly by gene-gene or gene-environmental
interactions &obrack;  Fig 1 &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#105:1>
The role of genetic factors in causing diabetes in young
patients is further highlighted by the increased heritability of diabetes
mellitus among their family members .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#106:1>
All but two if the 55 families screened so fat had at least one
other affected family member .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#107:1>
Among the 200 family members of patients with young onset of disease
, approximately 40&percent; had PG either in the diabetic or IGT range during
a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#108:1>
The majority of cases , however , had not been diagnosed previously .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#109:1>
This figure compares with a 1&percent; to 2&percent; prevalence of
diabetes in a random population of similar age. <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#110:1>
Furthermore , 90&percent; of the parents of the index patients who
underwent formal oral glucose tolerance testing were found to have diabetes
mellitus .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#111:1>
This figure compares with a prevalence of 20&percent; to 25&percent;
in a random population aged 60 years or older. <sp> 61 </sp> </p> <h> <bold>

Compared with patients who had antibodies to GAD , those who did not
were more obese , had a higher blood pressure , higher triglyceride levels ,
lower HDI-cholesterol levels , and increased albuminuria .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#115:1>
These findings suggest that the metabolic syndrome <O> Figure </O>
may have an earlier presentation in young patients in Hong Kong <sp> 40 </sp>
and corroborate the rising prevalence of childhood obesity in the local
population. <sp> 37,38 </sp> </p>

Obesity is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic ,
environmental , hormonal , and cultural factors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#117:1>
There are complex hormonal interactions in the regulation of food
intake , energy expenditure , and fat deposition. <sp> 15 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#118:1>
In this respect , it has been hypothesised that a reduced level of
growth hormone &obrack;  partly due to physical inactivity &cbrack; , changes in sex hormones
, and stress-related hypercortisolaemia may enhance the deposition of
visceral adipocytes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#119:1>
The latter have increased lipolytic activities in response to
catecholamines .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#120:1>
Increased production of free fatty acids can in turn lead to insulin
resistance and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion &obrack;  Fig 2). <sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#121:1>
Against this background , 51&percent; of the variance in waist
circumstance in young Hong Kong Chinese patients can be explained by a
reduced secretion of growth hormone and increased cortisol , and insulin
levels. <sp> 63 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#122:1>
We are currently exploring the interactions between these hormonal
factors and other candidate genes for obesity in these young patients . </p>

The importance of quality care of diabetic patients </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#124:1>
Diabetes mellitus-particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus , which
accounts for 97&percent; of all cases of diabetes-is a missive public health
problem that has major socio-economic implications. <sp> 64 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#125:1>
According to the WHO , rapid changes in lifestyles and
socio-economic developments in Asia will cause major increases in the
prevalence of diabetes in mainland China and India. <sp> 65 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#126:1>
It is established that 18 million people in China have diabetes
mellitus and that 50&percent; of cases will remain undiagnosed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#127:1>
The figure is expected to increase to 34 million in 2025 and will
occur mainly in the 40- to 50-year age-group. <sp> 65 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#128:1>
The effective management of diabetes depends on a holistic and
multidisciplinary approach that emphasizes prevention and patient education .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#129:1>
Owing to the complexity and chronicity of diabetes , a structured
disease management programme that uses periodic assessments , evidence-based
medicine to achieve treatment target , and patient empowerment is necessary
to ensure the quality of diabetes care .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#130:1>
To maximise the efficient use of finite health care resources ,
there is an increasing trend for patients with chronic disease such as
diabetes to be discharged to the community using a  ' shared care ' model. <sp>
66 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#131:1>
Under this scheme , carefully selected patients who are discharged
to community clinics are followed up according to a protocol designed by both
specialists and community doctor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#132:1>
Since the implementation of the shared care model in the Prince of
Wales Hospital in 1995 , more than 1000 patients have returned to the
community .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#133:1>
The majority of patients who have returned for reassessment had
stable metabolic and blood pressure control .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#134:1>
More than 80&percent; of these patients were satisfied with this
model of care and showed good knowledge about the disease and its management.
<sp> 67 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-024#135:1>
Because only a small proportion of diabetes patients in Hong
Kong has access to shared care , many cases of diabetes will remain
undiagnosed , untreated , or suboptimally treated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#136:1>
There is a need for structural changes within the health care system
and increased awareness of diabetes among both the general public and health
care professionals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-024#137:1>
Increased training opportunities for dedicated health care providers
in diabetes education and management are also urgently needed if quality and
affordable diabetes care is to become easily and widely available . </p>
