<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#2:1>
<p> Pillar <O> Chinese-character </O> and tie-beam are the core part of the
Chinese wooden structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#3:1>
The fundamental elements of the timber-frame structure are pillar ,
tie-beam , purloin <O> Chinese-character </O> and tou-kung <O>
Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#4:1>
The load of the roof passes through the purlins , tie-beams , pillars
and then finally to the platform .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#5:1>
so the wall which are built with bricks are not designed to carry any
loading and their function is limited to partitioning the rooms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#6:1>
Hence , for Chinese timber-frame structure , there is the common
saying that the <quote> &ldquo; even when the walls fall down , the house
will not collapse &rdquo; </quote> . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#7:1>
<p> This osseous construction permits complete freedom in walling and
fenestration and , by the simple adjustment of the proportion between walls
and openings , renders a house practical and comfortable in any climate from
that of tropical Indochina to that of subarctic Manchuria .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#8:1>
Due to its extreme flexibility and adaptability , this method of
construction could be employed wherever Chinese civilization spread and would
effectively shelter occupants from the elements . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#9:1>
<h> The Two Structural Systems </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#10:1>
<p> Between the first and second century , the development of the wooden
structure is formalized .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#11:1>
There is two main categories : One is &ldquo; Pillar-and-beam &rdquo;
structure <O> Chinese-character </O> , another is &ldquo;
Pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure <O> Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#12:1>
This structure adopts without any great change in the principle until
the nineteenth century . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#13:1>
<h> The &ldquo; Pillar-and-beam &rdquo; structure </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#14:1>
<p> The main principle is erecting pillars on the raised platform , putting
tie-beam <O> Chinese-character </O> on the pillars , placing short pillars
<O> Chinese-character </O> on the tie-beams , and then you find short
tie-beam <O> Chinese-character </O> is resting on the short pillars , the
short pillars are putting on the short tie-beams again , and then so on until
it reaches the ridge purlin <O> Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#15:1>
Moreover , the ends of the tie-beam are joined by the purlin <O>
Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#16:1>
So that the &ldquo; Pillars-and-beam &rdquo; structure is formed .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#17:1>
<p> The size and form of the structure are related to the width and property
of the building .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#18:1>
For small width , we can only use two pillars .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#19:1>
However , for large width , we must use three or more pillars to
support the tie-beams above .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#20:1>
We user the number of purlin as a standard to represent the scale of
the structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#21:1>
It is because the distance between purlins <O> Chinese-character </O>
is nearly constant , about two metres , in every building .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#22:1>
So that a large purlin number represents a giant building . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#23:1>
<h> The &ldquo; Pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#24:1>
<p> The main elements are pillar <O> Chinese-character </O> , <indig> chuen
fong </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O> , <indig> dao fong </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> , <indig> hin chi </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O>
and purlin <O> Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#25:1>
The load from the roof passes through the rafter <O>
Chinese-character </O> to the pillars , and then from purlins to the pillars .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#26:1>
The <indig> chuen fong </indig> are not load bearing , it only use as
a horizontal connector of the pillars . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#27:1>
<p> There are much more pillars and traverse-tie-beam in the &ldquo;
Pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo; structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#28:1>
So the diameter of the pillar is quite small &obrack; 20-30cm
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#29:1>
And the size of the <indig> chuen fong </indig> is much smaller than
the pillar .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#30:1>
&obrack; Height : 10-20cm . Width : 5-10cm &cbrack; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#31:1>
<p> The size of the structure is determined by the number of <indig> chuen
fong </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#32:1>
There are several types of forms , such as <O> Chinese-character </O>
and <O> Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#33:1>
Some pillars will not go down to the platform , instead , they just
rest on the <indig> chuen fong </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#34:1>
So that the internal space can be enlarge .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#35:1>
However , in this case , the size of <indig> chuen fong </indig> must
be increased so as to bear the load from the shorten pillars . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#36:1>
<p> Come to a nut shell , &ldquo; pillar-and-traverse-tie-beam &rdquo;
structure is a simple timber-frame structure .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#37:1>
It will not use in the giant building , such as the palace .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#38:1>
However , it is very common in the dwelling unit in the southern part
of China .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#39:1>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#40:1>
<h> <ul> Bracket Set &obrack; <indig> tou-kung </indig> &cbrack;
</ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#41:1>
<p> A set <indig> of tou-kung </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O> , or
brackets , is an assemblage of a number of <indig> tou </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> &obrack; blocks &cbrack; and <indig> kung </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> &obrack; arms &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#42:1>
The function of the set is to transfer the load from the horizontal
member above the vertical member below .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#43:1>
A set may be placed either on the column , or on the architrave
between two columns , or on the corner column , Accordingly , a set of
<indig> tou-kung </indig> may be called a &ldquo; column set &rdquo; ,
&ldquo; intermediate set &rdquo; , or &ldquo; corner set &rdquo; depending on
the position it occupies . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#44:1>
<p> The members that make up a set may be divided into three main categories
: <indig> tou </indig> , <indig> kung </indig> and <indig> ang </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#45:1>
There are four kinds of <indig> tou </indig> and five kinds of
<indig> kung </indig> , determined by their functions and positions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#46:1>
But structurally the most important members of a set are the <indig>
lu-tou </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O> or major bearing block , and the
<indig> hua-kung </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O> , to both front and rear
, at right angles to the facade of the building . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#47:1>
<p> Sometimes a slanting member , at approximately a 30&degree; angle to the
ground , is placed above the <indig> hua-kung </indig> &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#48:1>
it is called the <indig> ang </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#49:1>
The &ldquo; tail &rdquo; or upper end of <-> he </-> <+> the </+>
<indig> ang </indig> is often held down by the weight of the beam or the
purlin , making it a lever arm for the support of the large overhang of the
eave . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#50:1>
<p> The <indig> hua-kung </indig> may be used in successive tiers , each
extending front and rear a certain distance beyond the tier below .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#51:1>
Such a tier and extension is called a <indig> t'iao </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> or &ldquo; jump &rdquo; , and the number of <indig>
tiao </indig> in a set may vary from one to five .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#52:1>
Transverse <indig> kung </indig> interest the <indig> hua-kung
</indig> in the <indig> lu-tou </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#53:1>
One or two tiers of tranverse kung may be used in a <indig> t'iao
</indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#54:1>
Such an arrangement is known as <indig> chi-hsin </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> , or &ldquo; accounted heart &rdquo; , while a <indig>
tiao </indig> without transverse kung is known as <indig> t'ou-hsin </indig>
<O> Chinese-character </O> , or &ldquo; stolen heart &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#55:1>
One tier of transverse <indig> kung </indig> is called <indig>
tan-kung </indig> <O> Chinese-character </O> , or single <indig> kung
</indig> &semi;

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#56:1>
a double tier is call <indig> ch'ung-kung </indig> <O>
Chinese-character </O> , or double <indig> kung </indig> . <&>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#57:1>
<h> <ul> Development of the Timber Frame Structure </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#58:1>
<p> The earliest source that reveals he appeareance of a timber-frame
building is the relief on a bronze vase of the period of the Warring States
&obrack; 403-221 B.C. &cbrack; of the Chou Dynasty .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#59:1>
It show on a platform a two-storied building with columns , eaved
roofs , doors and railings .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#60:1>
Particularly significant are the indications of columns with the
characteristic bracket sets . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#61:1>
<p> Timber-frame structure may be tentatively divided into three main periods
: the Period of Vigor , the Period of Elegance and the Period of rigidity .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#62:1>
<h> The Period of Vigor </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#63:1>
<p> It includes the phase from the middle of the ninth century to the middle
of eleventh century , or from the reign of Emperor Hsuan-tsung of Emperor
Jen-tsung of the Sung dynasty .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#64:1>
This period is characterized by a robustness of proportion and
construction .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#65:1>
It shows for the first time the brackets with outstretching arms , or
hua-kung , uses as cantilevers to support the great overhang of the eave .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#66:1>
The two tiers of jutting <indig> hau-kung </indig> are intersected by
transverse <indig> kung </indig> , and the inverted-V intermediate set is
also used .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#67:1>
The examples can find in the Liao domain in North China . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#68:1>
<h> The Period of Elegance </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#69:1>
<p> It extends from the middle of the eleventh century to the end of the
fourteenth century or from the reign of Emperor Ying-tsung of the sung
dynasty , through the Yuan dynasty , to the death of Emperor T'ai-tsu .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#70:1>
It is marked by a gracefulness in proportion and refinement in detail .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#71:1>
<p> The most noticeable stylistic evolution is the gradual diminution of the
<indig> tou-kung </indig> , which were reduced from generally about one third
the height of the column to about one fourth by 1400 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#72:1>
The intermediate set becomes relatively larger in size and more
complicated in combination .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#73:1>
It further complicates by the introduction of the diagonal <indig>
kung </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#74:1>
This intermediate set becomes a burden to the architrave .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#75:1>
The <indig> ang  ' s </indig> disposition gives the architect a
wonderful opportunity to display his ingenuity , resulting in various
combination of great interest .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#76:1>
Moreover , the sets are always designed to do their share in
upholding the whole structure and are seldom idle or merely decorative . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#77:1>
<h> The Period of Rigidity </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#78:1>
<p> It lasts from the begining of the fifteenth century or the end of the
nineteenth century , or from the reign of Emperor Ch'eng-tau of the Ming
dynasty to the overthrow of the Ch'ing dynasty by the Republic .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#79:1>
It is identified by a general rigidity , a clumsiness of proportion
resulting from the excessive size of all horizontal members , and the
decrease in size of the <indig> tou-kung </indig> , hence the increase in
number of the intermediate sets , which have by this time degenerated from
their original structural function to mere ornaments . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#80:1>
<p> Measuring about one-half or one-third the height of the column in the
Sung Dynasty , <indig> tou-kung </indig> in the Ming Suddenly shrunken to
one-fifth .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#81:1>
The number of intermediate sets increase to seven or eight .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#82:1>
The <indig> ang </indig> with its long tail , has no place in a
column set with a disproportionately large beam directly on it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#83:1>
The false <indig> ang </indig> is therefore always employed where the
effect of <indig> ang </indig> is desired .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#84:1>
In the disposition of beams forming the roof support the <indig>
tou-kung </indig> is dispensed with altogether and the beams rest directly on
columns or struts .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#85:1>
The purlins are supported directly on the ends of the beams , without
the assistance of <indig> kung </indig> or the bracing of <indig> Ch'a-Shou
</indig> or <indig> t'o-chiao </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#86:1>
so the <indig> tou-kung </indig> , <-> expect </-> <+> except </+> in
the column sets , is therefore by now pure ornament . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#87:1>
<h> Case Study </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#88:1>
<h> &obrack; 1 &cbrack; The Period of Vigor -

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#89:1>
Main Hall of Fo-kuang Ssu </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#90:1>
<p> The oldest wooden structure known today is the Main Hall of Fo-kuang Ssu
, in the Wu-tai Mountains , Shans &semi; Province .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#91:1>
It was built in 857 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#92:1>
<p> It is extremely impressive with its rigorous and robust proportions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#93:1>
The enormous <indig> ton-kung </indig> of four tiers of cantilevers -
two tiers of <indig> hua-kung </indig> and two tiers of <indig> ang </indig>
- measuring about half the height of the columns with every piece of timber
in the ensemble doing its share as a structural member , give the building an
overwhelming dignity that is not found in later structures .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#94:1>
The building  ' s most significant feature , from the point of view of
dating structural evolution , is the formation of the &ldquo; truss &rdquo;
immediately under , and therefore supporting , the ridge .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#95:1>
On the top tier of beams are placed a pair of <indig> Cha-shou
</indig> &obrack; &ldquo; abutting arms &rdquo; &cbrack; butting against each
other to carry the ridge pole , while the &ldquo; king-post &rdquo; is
missing altogether .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#96:1>
This is a rare survival of early construction practice . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#97:1>
<O> architectural drawing </O>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#98:1>
<h> &obrack; 2 &cbrack; The Period of Elegance -

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#99:1>
Sheng Mu Miao </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#100:1>
<p> Sheng Mu Miao locates at Chin-tz'u , near T'aiyuan , Shans &semi;
Province .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#101:1>
It consists of a double-eaved Main Hall , Front Hall and a <indig>
p'ai-lou </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#102:1>
The two halls were built in the T'ien-sheng period &obrack;
1023-1031 &cbrack; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#103:1>
<p> A prominent characteristic of the <indig> tou-kung </indig> of the
Chiu-tz'u group is the shape of the beak of the <indig> ang </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#104:1>
In earlier buildings , the beak is a simple bevel , rectangular in
cross section .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#105:1>
But later , the beveled portion is scooped and pulvinated ,
resulting in a cross section with a rounded top .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#106:1>
And other feature of the <indig> tou-kung </indig> is the false <->
and </-> <+> ang </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#107:1>
Here the <indig> hua-kung </indig> is shaped on the outer end into a
beak like that of an <indig> ang </indig> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#108:1>
Thus the decorative effect of the <-> beck </-> <+> beak </+> is
obtained without using the slanting member itself .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#109:1>
The <indig> hua-kung </indig> becomes merely an &ldquo; applied
ornament &rdquo; , a sign of degeneration . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#110:1>
<h> &obrack; 3 &cbrack; The Period of Rigidity -

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#111:1>
The T'ai-ho Tien &obrack; Hall of Supreme Harmony &cbrack; </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#112:1>
<p> It is the principal audience hall of the palaces and the focal point of
the entire Forbidden City .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#113:1>
With its six rows of twelve columns each , forming a hypo style hall
eleven bags in length and five in depth , double-eaved and hip-roofed , it is
the largest single premodern building in China . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#114:1>
<p> The <indig> tou-kung </indig> of this gigantic hall are extremely small
in proportion - less than one-sixth of the column height .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#115:1>
As many as eight intermediate sets are used in one bay .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#116:1>
From a distance the presence of <indig> tou-kung </indig> is hardly
noticeable .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#117:1>
The walls , columns , doors and windows are painted vermilion , the
<indig> tou-kung </indig> and architraves are blue and green accented with
gold . </p> </I>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#118:2>
<h> <ul> INTRODUCTION </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#119:2>
<p> The wedding vow : <quote> &ldquo; For better or worse . . . . . . Till
death will we depart &rdquo; </quote> seems to be a faded motto in our
contemporary society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#120:2>
Nowadays , the ideology of the &ldquo; casual relationship &rdquo;
has become popular not only among the youth , but also gradually among the
general public . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#121:2>
<p> The concept such as : <quote> &ldquo; Having possessed once is more
desirable than staying together eternally &rdquo; </quote> , <quote> &ldquo;
Marriage is the grave of courtship &rdquo; </quote> , and <quote> &ldquo; To
marry owing to misunderstanding , and to separate owing to rational
understanding &rdquo; </quote> , has been promoted by the mass media , and
seems to be adopted by all walks of life .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#122:2>
Consequently , divorce is no longer a taboo in Hong Kong . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#123:2>
<p> Marriage , as the actualization of genuine love in the form of lasting
relationship , has been challenged from time to time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#124:2>
However , there exists some people who still uphold the value of
genuine love and lasting marriage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#125:2>
This paper aims to examine the essence of the lasting marital
relationship by reviewing the process and characteristics of courtship , as
well as the facts and consequences of divorce . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#126:2>
<h> <ul> PRESENT SITUATION IN HONG KONG </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#127:2>
<p> Being greatly influenced by the western culture , the fad of liberalism
and pleasure principle has arrived at Hong Kong at the 70's .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#128:2>
With the increased prosperity of the society , the emergence of
nuclear family , the declination of the traditional norms , and the
propaganda of the mass media , the form of heterosexual relationship becomes
diversified . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#129:2>
<p> Pre-marital and ex-marital ships are not uncommon in the society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#130:2>
<-> Causal </-> <+> Casual </+> sex not only exists among the
&ldquo; yuppies &rdquo; , but also among the &ldquo; marginal &rdquo; and
&ldquo; normal &rdquo; youth .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#131:2>
Furthermore , divorce rate has been raised sharply , with
approximately 5700 cases at 1987 , 5898 cases in 1988 , and definitely more
at the years afterwards . <fnr> &obrack; 1 &cbrack; </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#132:2>
<p> Even the most traditional sector , the Christian circle has no exception
either .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#133:2>
Increasing number of cases of marital breakdown has been reported
among the Christians with the majority of them having married for two or
three years only . <fnr> &obrack; 2 &cbrack; </fnr> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#134:2>
<p> With the coming of 1997 , most of the families in Hong Kong are
experiencing exceeding stress .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#135:2>
The political and social uncertainty : especially after the &ldquo;
4th of June &rdquo; event &semi; has <-> explosed </-> <+> exposed </+> the
fragility and vulnerability of many marriages .

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#136:2>
These , together with the problems aroused by emigration ,
contribute significant to the mounting up of the marital hazard and actual
marital breakdown . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#137:2>
<p> Is it possible for the marriage to survive under stress ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#138:2>
What can the marriage contribute to the ups and downs in our life
cycle ?

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#139:2>
How can we establish and maintain a lively and enduring marital
relationship ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#140:2>
<p> To answer the above questions , reviewing the process and the
characteristics of courtship and divorce may provide some valuable insights .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#141:2>
<h> <ul> COURTSHIP - ITS PROCESS AND CHARACTERISTICS </ul> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#142:2>
<p> Courtship is the period which follows <-> causal </-> <+> casual </+>
dating and precedes engagement and marriage . <fnr> &obrack; 3 &cbrack;
</fnr>

<ICE-HK:W1A-006#143:2>
