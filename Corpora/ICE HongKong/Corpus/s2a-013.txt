It  ' s seventeen eighty now for the favourite Top Tech number
three uh support for number nine he  ' s been the best backed to beat him Relax
Stephen Leung and Ricky Choi at fifty one fifty <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#2:1:A>
also dropping to single quotes Chiu Wah Best at eighty four fifty
and five Happy Win at around ninety nine dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#3:1:A>
Only a small field ah after Top Tech I think it  ' s pretty hard <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#4:1:A>
looks hard to beat Gary Moore and Danny Beasley have been
unstoppable in recent times and they combine with Top Tech in the event
coming up <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#5:1:A>
they  ' re starting to load though race two the Rangitikei Handicap
class five gallopers seventeen hundred metres <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#6:1:A>

Lau but first of all it  ' s a very good evening to our race caller Harry Troy
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-013#7:1:B>
Thanks Steve and a very good evening everyone as <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#8:1:B>
the last couple go forward for the second of the evening they  ' ve
got Midnite Mouse King and Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#9:1:B>
about to make the line complete <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#10:1:B>
favourite number three Top Tech odds on <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#11:1:B>
all clear goes up seventeen hundred metres they  ' re off and running
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#12:1:B>
just about jumped as one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#13:1:B>
no speed in the early part <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#14:1:B>
Happy Win drifted back and Blessings with not much speed <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#15:1:B>
very hard ridden in the early part is Relax he  ' s keen to lead as
they run towards the 200 the first time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#16:1:B>
kicking up on the inside though to keep him out is Jet Air <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#17:1:B>
favourite  ' s prominent third the box seat for Beasley <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#18:1:B>
two  ' s outside that  ' s Chiu Wah Best <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#19:1:B>
crowded out three deep Midnite Mouse King and they race out of the
straight followed by Blessings By My self is second last and a space of seven
or eight back to Happy Win who cannot keep up he  ' s the tail ender <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#20:1:B>
twelve hundred metres out Jet Air and Relax go together they lead
three parts Top Tech getting a little closer and travelling nicely as they
run into the back <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#21:1:B>
Blessings now has the box seat run fourth the rail to his outside
is Chiu Wah Best as they go by the nine hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#22:1:B>
now a couple back then Midnite Mouse King no too far away he  ' s
starting to pick up the bit and pay close attention now <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#23:1:B>
followed by By My Self and Happy Win starting to tack on at this
early stage <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#24:1:B>
seven hundred metres out Relax strides to the front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#25:1:B>
he shadows the favourite and that  ' s Top Tech three parts away
running back on the inside there is Jet Air he runs third fourth to his
outside then is Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#26:1:B>
going forward Chiu Wah Best on the back of them Midnite Mouse King
Happy win is about to take off from the tail of the field <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#27:1:B>
and By Myself has now dropped out to last <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#28:1:B>
five hundred out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#29:1:B>
and Relax a half length in front but the favourite getting closer
very quickly Top Tech he travels well <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#30:1:B>
following him into the race then is Blessings un under plenty of
pressure Jet Air then Chiu Wah Best Happy Win swings wide <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#31:1:B>
straightening now for the run in Top Tech popped the question by
Beasley and he  ' s a length and a half in advance of Blessings who gives chase
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#32:1:B>
Midnite Mouse King winding it it up over on the inside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#33:1:B>
Happy Win down the outside Top Tech in front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#34:1:B>
one hundred out trying to get on terms with him Blessings Jet Air
Happy Win down the outside <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#35:1:B>
but Top Tech is going to be a little bit too good for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#36:1:B>
Top Tech will take the prize it  ' s going to be a photo second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#37:1:B>
Blessings or Jet Air very close that one <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#38:1:B>
over on the inside Midnite Mouse King followed by Happy Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#39:1:B>
a big space back then to Chiu Wah Best followed then by By Myself
and Relax the early leader has finished last of all <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#40:1:B>
Ah he  ' s just a little bit too good for them <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#41:1:B>
even with the big weight of one thirty two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#42:1:B>
number three is the winner Top Tech <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#43:1:B>
three is the winner Top Tech judge will call a photo for second
Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#44:1:B>
but making it very interesting is Jet Air <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#45:1:B>
uh he was under plenty of pressure coming to the turn Jet Air but
he <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#46:1:B>
raised another effort and he  ' s in a photo for second with
Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#47:1:B>
Happy Win who started a long run from about the six hundred looked
a chance but he  ' s dropped off and maybe Midnite Mouse King will land that
fourth spot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#48:1:B>
lets pardon me let  ' s have a look <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#49:1:B>
we  ' ve got Top Tech he  ' ll take the prize <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#50:1:B>
and this is just going to be a bob of the heads for that second
spot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#51:1:B>
on back you  ' d say Blessings bobs back on the inside and takes that
second spot this will confirm it <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#52:1:B>
Chiu Wah Best the winner <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#53:1:B>
now lets have a look at the bob here now I think Blessings may have
bobbed back on the inside and gee that  ' s an eyelash <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#54:1:B>
almost a dead heat <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#55:1:B>
he  ' s got a habit of bobbing at the right time Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#56:1:B>
for these minor photos and he  ' s bobbed back and made this very
interesting <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#57:1:B>
and it  ' s good enough to a dead heat in fact he has run second so
three seven six and four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#58:1:B>
three seven six and four the winner number three Top Tech Danny
Beasley rode Top Tech for Gary Moore <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#59:1:B>
and he  ' s a four year old bay New Zealand bred gelding by Prince of
Praise from the Torino mare Chapel Rose two wins from four starts since
joining the Gary Moore stable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#60:1:B>
two wins one second in fact <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#61:1:B>
from four starts he  ' s really improved this horse no end <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#62:1:B>
and really loves these staying contests number three Top Tech the
winner carried the one thirty two pounds and carried it in pretty good style
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#63:1:B>
number seven is second Blessings <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#64:1:B>
Christian Reith for Gordon Benson <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#65:1:B>
number six winding up in third Jet Air Robbie Burke P K Wong and
officially fourth number four Midnite Mouse King Peter Ho for K K Sin <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#66:1:B>
Three seven six and four <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#67:1:B>
and Danny Beasley continuing on his winning way <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#68:1:B>
when he travelled on the weekend <,> uh actually we found it <,>
probably a bit unusual we weren't singing his praises yesterday without a
winner on the uh <,> the card last night but with the weekend score he  ' s on
a total of eighteen before tonight that makes it nineteen wins from around
fifty two rides <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#69:1:B>
so terrific strike rate

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#70:1:B>
here  ' s the dividends and Steve Mooney <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-013#71:1:A>
Number three Top Tech nineteen sixty and ten ninety fifteen
twenty and fifteen ten the Q seventy two dollars the tierce six hundred and
forty six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#72:1:A>
that  ' s for the number three seven six heading to a break back
shortly <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#73:1:A>
<&> Commercial break </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-013#74:1:A>
Welcome back live here to Taipo racecourse we now have the
weighed in sign for the second on three seven six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#75:1:A>
Top Tech for Gary Moore and Danny Beasley nineteen sixty and ten
ninety <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#76:1:A>
seven Blessings fifteen twenty and number six running third and
that is Jet Air <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#77:1:A>
and he returned fifteen dollars and ten cents <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#78:1:A>
the Q seventy two dollars the tierce six hundred and forty six <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#79:1:A>
one and a half lengths by a nose <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#80:1:A>
one fifty one neat the run time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#81:1:A>
so three runs for Gary uh four runs uh that  ' s the fourth run for
Gary Moore two thirds and two wins <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#82:1:A>
certainly has improved Top Tech and uh I must say I thought he was
uh well I thought a couple of starts back might have been a bit of a query
running at these trips but he  ' s doing it in very very good style <,> today

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#83:1:A>
carried one thirty two pounds <,> and was just a little too strong
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#84:1:A>
So we now have a look at the head on replay and he really did do it
easily Top Tech he had the issue beyond doubt <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#85:1:A>
Blessings was there but he  ' s not really a chaser and ah he  ' s just
held on for second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#86:1:A>
you can see Jet Air running on well as is Happy Win and eventually
though uh Blessings uh fought back a little better than what he normally does
just to kick back for that second position <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#87:1:A>
uh you can see Jet Air in that lime green cap comes again to finish
third <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#88:1:A>
Happy Win not far away but actually beating him for the fourth
position was the horse towards the rail in the white cap and that was Midnite
Mouse King <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-013#89:1:B>
Let  ' s have a look at the get away and coming together there
just after the jump was Midnite Mouse King and Happy Win Happy Win getting
back which is <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#90:1:B>
the norm for him and likewise Blessings got back in the early part
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#91:1:B>
coming out in front Jet Air but taken on by Relax favourite already
box seated the third Top tech and he  ' s outside Chiu Wah Best <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#92:1:B>
bit of money for Chiu Wah Best tonight but he hasn't justified it
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#93:1:B>
to his outside was Midnite Mouse King we  ' ve got Blessings second
last in your frame By Myself  ' s the last one you see until <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#94:1:B>
you see Happy Win pop in and he  ' s eight and nine lengths off them
already <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#95:1:B>
into the back and striding to the front now Relax and second spot
Jet Air <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#96:1:B>
Danny Beasley was never going to let the leaders get too far away
but he travelled nicely throughout Top Tech he  ' s goes up now to sit second
outside of the leader Relax <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#97:1:B>
Jet Air back to third Blessings enjoying a nice run in fourth <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#98:1:B>
off the bridle Chiu Wah Best <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#99:1:B>
on the back of him was Midnite Mouse King By Myself and about now
Happy Win started to pick them up and started a long run from about the seven
hundred right around the outside of the field <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#100:1:B>
Relax still the pilot as they go towards the six hundred <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#101:1:B>
in second spot the favourite travelling very nicely Top Tech Jet
Air back to third Blessings fourth and then to the outside of them Chiu Wah
Best about to tack on Happy Win <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#102:1:B>
Midnight Mouse King was under a bit of pressure at this stage <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#103:1:B>
has run on fairly and Happy Win that  ' s him taking off right
around the outside of the field <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#104:1:B>
did look a definite threat coming to the return but he could
sustain that run <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#105:1:B>
Top Tech still travelling nicely and uh about now when he
straightens up Danny Beasley pops the question to him <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#106:1:B>
he got a nice break probably a length and a half to two lengths
and he  ' s maintained that right down the length of the straight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#107:1:B>
the other runners just couldn't pick him up and Mid Midnight Mouse
King over on the rails Jet Air battling along in the lime cap Happy Win  ' s
run come to an end <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#108:1:B>
and uh it was Top Tech left to Blessings to fight back on the
inside for the Q spot <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-013#109:1:B>
Jet Air has run okay first time at the distance <,>

<$A>
