Dear Alexandra ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#3:1>
I  ' ve been home for two weeks now after leaving Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#4:1>
I really enjoy my holiday in Hong Kong , as I can meet many nice
friends as you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#5:1>
Moreover , Hong Kong is a nice place , as the view is very beautiful .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#6:1>
There is many cheap and beautiful things to buy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#7:1>
I tell you that I have bought many clothes in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#8:1>
Moreover , I have taken my photo with the excellent view . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#9:1>
Once again thank you for your help to get around Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#10:1>
If I haven't your help , I will miss many tourist spot and my holiday
will become very boring and dull .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#11:1>
Next time when you write to me , please tell me about your family and
your school .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#12:1>
Do you want to go to Canada to have a holiday ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#13:1>
Which subjects do you study in school ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#14:1>
I need to pen down now because I have many homework and I need to
hand them tomorrow to my teacher .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#15:1>
Thus , I need to do my homework now .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#16:1>
Please write to me as soon as possible . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#17:1>

Dear Alexandra ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#20:2>
Thanks very much for the lovely card and letter you sent me which
I received yesterday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#21:2>
I am writing back so soon , so that you  ' ll get this before Christmas
I was really pleased to receive your letters and learn that you are well and
find out what you  ' ve been doing .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#22:2>
Thanks , too , for telling me a bit about your family .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#23:2>
By the time you get this , you will be almost finished school for the
year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#24:2>
I hope you enjoy the party on the last day .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#25:2>
And then it  ' s your birthday on the next day .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#26:2>
I hope that is a really nice day for you next time when you write ,
will you tell me how the school party was and what you did for your birthday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#27:2>
Also , what sort of thing did you do with your friends while you were
on holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#28:2>
When do you go back to school ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#29:2>
You said that you were hoping to go to either Europe or Canada &dash;
have you decided yet ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#30:2>
And you said about first having to earn some money to be able to go
there &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#31:2>
how do you earn money ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#32:2>
do you have a job before or after school or at weekends ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#33:2>
Now I am working at a department store near my home at the weekend to
earn some extra money .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#34:2>
At the moment , I  ' m saving as much as I can as fast as I am so that
I can go to Hong Kong again as soon as possible &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#35:2>
I had such a good time there and didn't have time to see all I wanted
to so .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#36:2>
I want to come back to see all the people I met there again and to
see the things I didn't get to see this year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#37:2>
I had hoped and I was sort of planning for it to be next year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#38:2>
I came but everything now costs so much &obrack; as you said &cbrack;
that I think I  ' ll have to aim at the year after next or even the one after
that to get there .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#39:2>
Anyway , I will as soon as I can .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#40:2>
Do you want to come to Canada ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#41:2>
I think you  ' d like it here .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#42:2>
There are a lot of Asian people living here &dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#43:2>
a lot of them are students who come to study at our colleges and
universities .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#44:2>
What do you want to be when you finish your studies ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#45:2>
&obrack; or don't you know yet ? &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#46:2>
By the way , how  ' s your friend who was with us on the day we were
together .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#47:2>
Please say hello to her for me and wish her a Merry Christmas and a
happy New Year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#48:2>
I am well and , like you , looking forward to my holidays at
Christmas &obrack; next week &cbrack; until mid January so that  ' s a good
break , isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#49:2>
I  ' ll be spending most of that time at home &dash; with family and
friends and doing things around Vancouver .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#50:2>
But then for the last week I  ' m going to study with friends in their
home .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#51:2>
Then , I will start my second semester .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#52:2>
I hope you have a Happy Birthday and a really nice Christmas and New
Year and that you enjoy your holiday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#53:2>
Look after yourself and if you have time , please write to me as soon
as possible .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#54:2>
I  ' d love to hear from you again sometimes . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#57:3>
Dear Alexandra ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#58:3>
In my last few letters , I have told you little about myself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#59:3>
In this letter , I would like to tell you more about myself .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#60:3>
I  ' ve also attached two postcards to help you to know more about
Calgary .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#61:3>
In fact , Calgary really have nothing very attractive , except for
the Calgary Tower &obrack; equivalent to the CN Tower in Toronto . &cbrack;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#62:3>
The tram is similar to the MTR in Hong Kong , except it has no
air conditioner and it doesn't go as fast as in Hong Kong MTR . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#63:3>
The building with the funny roof is the Olympic Saddledome
&obrack; shape of it in built to look like a horse saddle &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#64:3>
Some of the Olympic games were held there in 1988 .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#65:3>
In this postcard , the night view is overlooking the Bow River , the
largest river exist within Calgary that is natural .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#66:3>
How do you think about Calgary before and after you have this
postcard ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#67:3>
In second postcard , I would like to give you an idea about
University of Calgary .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#68:3>
This is sort of out of date since a new building is currently under
construction &obrack; Professiona1 Building &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#69:3>
It  ' s due to be finished by fall 1993 , a new facility which I  ' ll
have no pleasure of using because I will graduate this year May .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#70:3>
The Management building &obrack; Scurfield Hall &cbrack; is the one
with triangular roof , weird in the Olympic Oval .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#71:3>
It was built in 1988 especially for the Winter Olympics &dash; for
speed skating . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#72:3>
How is the University of Hong Kong and how about your friends and
teachers ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#73:3>
How about your school life ? </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#74:3>
Got to go .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#75:3>
Take care .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#76:3>
Write me as soon as possible .

Dear Alexandra ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#80:4>
How  ' s it going ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#81:4>
How are you enjoying your life at the university ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#82:4>
Haven't learned from you for a while , I hope school life is better
than the work life you mentioned in the summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#83:4>
Sorry I haven't written you since your letter in the summer ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#84:4>
I was busy with my school work ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#85:4>
as you know it is my last year of schooling and the workload is very
heavy .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#86:4>
The other reasons is I  ' m very busy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#87:4>
My fall semester went by very fast .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#88:4>
A lot more individual work than last year .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#89:4>
Finally , the last year of school , but I found it very difficult to
get motivated and get things done right now ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#90:4>
all I want to do is SLEEP !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#91:4>
Maybe , I  ' m just getting old .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#92:4>
What about you ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#93:4>
How are your courses ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#94:4>
Does university life meet up to your expectation ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#95:4>
So far , job search hasn't been successful for me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#96:4>
Right now , I  ' m still facing the discussion of where I want to work
&semi; but really , I haven't thought much about it since I got back .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#97:4>
The career prospect in Calgary seems grimmer and grimmer each day
&dash;

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#98:4>
even one of the major Chartered Banks are laying off people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#99:4>
What are your plans for Christmas ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#100:4>
How are you going to celebrate your birthday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#101:4>
Anyhow , I better get going .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#102:4>
Take Care ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#103:4>
I am waiting anxiously to hear from you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#104:4>
Happy Birthday !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#105:4>
All the best in the years to come !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#106:4>
Enclosed is a picture I promised you . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#107:4>
Merry Christmas &ampersand; Best Wishes

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#110:5>
Dearest Sophis ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#111:5>
Thanks very much for your letter and card .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#112:5>
I received your letter only a few days before the card you sent me .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#113:5>
I guess it is because you did not put &ldquo; U.S.A. &ldquo; on the
envelope .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#114:5>
The stupid postal workers did not even know where Ohio was .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#115:5>
I have sent you a Christmas parcel in late October .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#116:5>
I hope it will get to you finally .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#117:5>
I sent it by surface mail , so it may take a while .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#118:5>
One can't really have much confidence with the postal services
nowadays .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#119:5>
I also tried calling your &ldquo; mini &rdquo; a few days ago .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#120:5>
May be it  ' s too late at night &obrack; around 12 pm HK time
&cbrack; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#121:5>
the man who answered the phone seemed to be very rude and he hang up
before I could leave a message to you . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#122:5>
How do you like Australia ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#123:5>
Which part of Australia did you visit ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#124:5>
You are very welcomed to come and visit the States with or without
your boyfriend .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#125:5>
You can stay in our place for as long as you want .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#126:5>
We are planning to move to the east coast in summer .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#127:5>
If you really plan to come here next year , you won't be bored .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#128:5>
There are more to see in the east coast than the Midwest .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#129:5>
We  ' ll move either to Washington , D.C. or Boston , but more likely
to the D.C. area .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#130:5>
By the way , we may visit H.K. next year Christmas .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#131:5>
A long wait though ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#132:5>
I  ' m happy to hear that you have a plan for your future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#133:5>
I  ' m not sure whether you mean quitting your job and study full time
for a Law degree or just continue going for part time .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#134:5>
Whichever way you choose , I  ' m sure that if you have the abilities
and education , you will be very employable anywhere .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#135:5>
After I have been in the States for a while , I realize that those
who are unemployed here are mostly people who have low skill and low
education .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#136:5>
Those who have the knowledge and information are usually handsomely
paid for their job .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#137:5>
Go for your plan !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#138:5>
<-> Hardwork </-> <+> Hard work </+> will be paid off in future , I  ' m
sure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#139:5>
However I can share some of my experience with you .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#140:5>
I think the love between men and women is the most fragile kind of
love in the world .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#141:5>
Parental love is unconditional and uncalculating .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#142:5>
Parents won't think about how much they can get back from the child
before they give their love .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#143:5>
Moreover the love between friends is not as demanding as the love
between men and women .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#144:5>
My point is that if one can love the other person without calculate
what one can get back from the relationship , this will be the greatest love
of all .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#145:5>
It will be closer to the parental love .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#146:5>
Remember a verse about love in Corinthian II in the New Testament ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#147:5>
it says all about the uncalculating nature of love .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#148:5>
If you can love someone like that you will feel more secure because
you won't be scared of losing someone  ' s love in future .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#149:5>
Love is giving , not taking ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#150:5>
In my opinion , you should be careful in choosing the right
person rather settling for the second best .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#151:5>
You have to use your own instinct and judgement to evaluate the
person .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#152:5>
I sincerely hope to attend your marriage ceremony in the near future !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#153:5>
Though marriage is the only hope of happiness for women , it is an
important stage in one  ' s life experiences .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#154:5>
From my own experiences , though there are a lot of obstacles in my
marriage relationship <-> woth </-> <+> with </+> Bob , I think my life has
been enriched .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#155:5>
<-> Afterall </-> <+> after all </+> life is full of obstacles ,
isn't it ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#156:5>
I hope I have given you some inspiration in your decision-making
regarding your relationship <-> woth </-> <+> with </+> your boyfriend . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#157:5>
I am doing pretty well in the States .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#158:5>
I have settled and got used to the environment .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#159:5>
I did not follow through the application of the Master degree in
University of Maryland .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#160:5>
I decide to go for a Ph.D in sociology instead .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#161:5>
I will apply for 6 universities and hope to be accepted for one of
their Ph.D programs .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#162:5>
However if I  ' m not able <-> ro </-> <+> to </+> get the
assistantship as what I  ' m having now , I  ' ll probably find a job in the
statistical analysis and research area .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#163:5>
I  ' m now busy with my thesis .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#164:5>
My thesis topic is on the causes of persistent poverty in America .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#165:5>
It makes me more conscious of the upward mobility of myself in the
economic and social stratification in American society . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#166:5>
Thanks again for your card !

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#167:5>
Hope you  ' ll receive my Christmas parcel soon ! </I>

DECEMBER 4 , 1993

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#169:6>
DEAR SHIRLEY ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#170:6>
HI , WHAT  ' s UP ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#171:6>
IT  ' s ME AGAIN , REALLY AGAIN .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#172:6>
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY WE BOTH WROTE BACK SO QUICKLY .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#173:6>
I CAN TELL YOU WHY .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#174:6>
IT  ' s MAINLY BECAUSE OF OUR &ldquo; MAIN THEME &rdquo; ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#175:6>
DON'T YOU AGREE ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#176:6>
WELL , I  ' ll COME BACK WITH THAT TOPIC LATER ON ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#177:6>
NOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY PRESENT SITUATION FIRST ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#178:6>
NO MATTER YOU  ' re INTERESTED OR NOT , YOU HAVE TO LISTEN .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#179:6>
IT  ' s GETTING COLD HERE AND SNOW SOME OF THE TIME .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#180:6>
I HATE SNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE TO DRIVE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#181:6>
HEY , HAVE I TOLD YOU THAT I BOUGHT A CAR ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#182:6>
WELL , I DID ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#183:6>
IT WAS DURING MID SUMMER .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#184:6>
I HAD A TERRIBLE TIME DURING SUMMER LIVING ON CAMPUS .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#185:6>
HARDLY ANY OF MY FRIENDS WERE HERE AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY
TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO ANY WHERE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#186:6>
SO I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR A CAR AND THAT THING COST ME A FORTUNE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#187:6>
GUESS WHAT ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#188:6>
I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE WEEK OF CLASSES AND ONE WEEK OF FINALS THEN I
WILL BE OUT OF HERE .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#189:6>
WE HAVE 3 WEEKS OFF FOR CHRISTMAS .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#190:6>
THE FIRST WEEK , I WILL GO BACK TO WOOSTER , WHERE I LIVED DURING MY
FIRST YEAR HERE , TO SEE MY FRIENDS .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#191:6>
THE REST OF THE BREAK , I WILL DRIVE DOWN TO PHILADELPHIA , ATLANTIC
CITY AND IF I STILL HAVE TIME LEFT , I WILL GO TO NEW YORK CITY TOO .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#192:6>
DOESN'T IT SOUND EXCITING ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#193:6>
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#194:6>
I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#195:6>
I WISH YOU WERE HERE

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#196:6>
THEN WE COULD GO TOGETHER .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#197:6>
HAVE YOU SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY TO COME VISIT <-> MY </-> <+> me </+>
YET ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#198:6>
YOU  ' ve SAID IT FOR A LONG TIME , REMEMBER ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#199:6>
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE NOW ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#200:6>
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-001#201:6>
ABOUT KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE FORMER F.5 CLASSMATES , YOU KNOW
I AM NOT TOO GOOD AT THAT .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#202:6>
I CALLED CONNIE WONG LAST WEEK OR THE WEEK BEFORE , I DON'T REMEMBER .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#203:6>
THAT DAY WAS HER BIRTHDAY , AND I DIDN'T SEND HER ANYTHING SO I
DECIDED TO CALL HER UP .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#204:6>
SHE SOUNDED THE SAME BUT I FELT VERY STRANGE TALKING TO HER .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#205:6>
I WAS LIKE TALKING TO SOMEONE I HAD NEVER MET .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#206:6>
I DIDN'T FEEL TOO COMFORTABLE , WE TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN WE
HUNG UP .

ABOUT PING PING AND CONNIE KWOK , I SHOULD SAY BETHANY KWOK , I HAVE
TALKED TO NEITHER ONE OF THEM LATELY .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#208:6>
BETHANY , DOESN'T IT SOUND ODD TO YOU ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#209:6>
IT DOES TO ME , BUT ANYWAY , SHE WROTE ME TWO WEEKS AGO .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#210:6>
I AM A LITTLE MAD AT HER .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#211:6>
SHE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TAKE TURNS CALLING EACH OTHER EVERY
WEEK .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#212:6>
I FOLLOWED THE PLAN BUT SHE <-> EVER </-> <+> never </+> DID WHEN IT
CAME TO HER TURN .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#213:6>
SHE OFTEN GIVES ME ALL SORTS OF EXCUSES AND I HAVE TO SAY I AM VERY
TIRED OF LISTENING TO THEM

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#214:6>
LAST TIME WHEN SHE WROTE ME SHE SAID SHE HAD LOST MY NUMBER BECAUSE
HER ROOMMATE WROTE IT ON SOME KIND OF NEWSPAPER , SO SHE COULDN'T CALL .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#215:6>
THAT MAKES SENSE BUT NOT AFTER ALL THE OTHER ONES . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#216:6>
YOU SOUNDED VERY HAPPY WITH BRAIN IN YOUR LAST LETTER BUT I
THINK YOU ARE A LITTLE TOO PESSIMISTIC .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#217:6>
I THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE BECAUSE YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON
AND BRAIN SHOULD KNOW .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#218:6>
I SELDOM SEE RICK NOWADAYS BECAUSE HE HAS MOVED OFF CAMPUS WHICH I
AM GLAD ABOUT .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#219:6>
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM BECAUSE I FEEL SOMETHING WHENEVER I SEE HIM
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THAT FEELING IS .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#220:6>
MY FRIENDS ALL SAY THAT HE IS GOOD LOOKING AND NICE AND I SHOULDN'T
BE THAT CRUEL TO HIM AND SAY THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER GOING OUT WITH HIM AGAIN .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#221:6>
OUTSIDERS ARE OUTSIDERS ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#222:6>
HOW MANY OF THEM KNOW MY FEELINGS ARE ?

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#223:6>
THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS BETWEEN US .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#224:6>
NOW I AM ENJOYING BEING INDEPENDENT AND ENJOYING BEING BY MYSELF .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#225:6>
I HAVE MORE TIME TO STUDY , FINALS ARE COMING UP AND I NEED THE TIME .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#226:6>
WE DON'T HAVE E-MAIL IN OUR SCHOOL YET .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#227:6>
THE BIG PROJECT INCLUDING INSTALLING CABLE IN DORMS AND A WHOLE
BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS RELATED TO COMPUTERS ARE STILL IN PROGRESS .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#228:6>
BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT SEMESTER , HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE
E-MAIL AND HAVE LECTURES IN OUR OWN ROOMS IF WE MISS CLASSES .

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#229:6>
I HAVE BEEN SITTING IN FRONT OF THIS COMPUTER FOR QUITE A WHILE ,

<ICE-HK:W1B-001#230:6>
