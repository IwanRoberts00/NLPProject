TALKS with China on the Government  ' s compulsory pension plan will
not be held until public consultation is completed at the end of October , it
has emerged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#4:1>
According to the government timetable , the Executive Council will
meet at the end of the consultation period and decide how to proceed in view
of public opinion on the old-age scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#5:1>
A senior official did not rule out the possibility of changing the
scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#6:1>
However , there would be no official discussion with Chinese
officials at the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group &obrack; JLG &cbrack;
during the consultation period , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#7:1>
A Chinese JLG negotiator , Chen Zuo'er , complained on Sunday that
Beijing had received no detailed information on the blueprint , except the
government booklet on the scheme that &ldquo; was available everywhere
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#8:1>
The document , he added , was not given to them until after the
proposal was made public . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#9:1>
Even though the Government had said time and again it wanted to
discuss the scheme with China , Mr Chen said it had unilaterally put forward
the scheme without consultation beforehand . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#10:1>
The Acting Secretary for Education and Manpower , Lam Woon-kwong
, said yesterday that the full consultancy report conducted by the Wyatt
Company had been sent to the Chinese JLG office last week . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#11:1>
When asked why the Government had not sent the full report to the
Chinese side earlier , Mr Lam was quoted as saying : &ldquo; We always keep
the information open . Anyone who approaches us can get it . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#12:1>
He was speaking at a meeting with the Association for Democracy
and People  ' s Livelihood &obrack; ADPL &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#13:1>
ADPL chairman Frederick Fung Kin-kee said : &ldquo; The
Government should have given it &obrack; the Wyatt report &cbrack; to the
Chinese side together with the consultation booklet .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#14:1>
It should have known they will not take the initiative to ask for it
, &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#15:1>
Mr Fung , a Hong Kong affairs adviser , has also attacked Xinhua
&obrack; the New China News Agency &cbrack; officials  '  consultation on the
pension scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#16:1>
He criticised Xinhua for not making a &ldquo; fair arrangement
&rdquo; when holding discussions on the scheme with the China-appointed
representatives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#17:1>
He said he was among those affairs advisers who were not invited
to attend the first meeting last Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#18:1>
It was not known who would be invited to the next one or when it
would be . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#19:1>
Mr Fung said the ADPL had proposed linking the amount of pension
payments with the length of contribution period . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#20:1>
Those who had contributed for 10 years should be paid 30 per cent
of the average earnings at the time of repayment .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#21:1>
Those who had contributed for 10 to 20 years should get 35 per cent ,
while those who had paid for more than 20 years should get 40 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#22:1>
Mr Lam said the blueprint allowed room to consider this proposal
, but whether to accept it had to be decided by the future government . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#23:1>
The Government proposes that both employers and employees
contribute 1.5 per cent of salaries and that everyone over 65 will receive
&dollar;2,300 a month &obrack; at 1994 levels &cbrack; . </p> </I>

<bold> Activist rejection sparks withdrawal </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#26:2>
A CANDIDATE from Kwun Tong yesterday withdrew from the district
board election to protest against the disqualification of dissident Lau
Shan-ching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#27:2>
Chan Cheong , 40 , editor of the political magazine <it> October
Review </it> , accused the Government of making the decision for &ldquo;
political considerations &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#28:2>
Mr Chan , an elected district board member in Lam Tin since 1985
, said the Government was &ldquo; attempting to please the Chinese side
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#29:2>
Mr Lau , who spent 10 years in jail for &ldquo;
counter-revolutionary &rdquo; activities , had his nomination to stand in
Kwai Tsing refused because he failed to meet the residency requirement . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#30:2>
Mr Chan said his withdrawal was a protest against &ldquo; the
deprivation of Lau  ' s political right and the possible deprivation of public
civil rights in the future &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#31:2>
His withdrawal may create an uncontested seat in Lam Tin because
only one other candidate has registered . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#32:2>
Mr Lau finished a 30-hour hunger strike outside the Central
Government Office by petitioning Government House yesterday afternoon . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#33:2>
He gave some Chinese medicine to the Acting Governor , Anson Chan
Fang On-sang , to indicate that the Government was an unqualified doctor and
had made the wrong judgment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#34:2>
Mr Lau said he would be seeking legal advice about the
possibility of further action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#35:2>
Today , the major parties will nominate candidates to
constituencies which are so far favourable to their competitors . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#36:2>
Liberal Party chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei will accompany three
more candidates to register at Tai Po district office . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#37:2>
And the Association for Democracy and People  ' s Livelihood
vice-chairman , Bruce Liu Sing-lee , who has changed his mind at the last
minute , will register for a seat in Wong Tai Sin after party member Yeung
Man-wai was disqualified . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#38:2>
Chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for Betterment of
Hong Kong &obrack; DAB &cbrack; , Tsang Yok-sing , said he might nominate two
more candidates for uncontested constituencies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#39:2>
And the United Democrats  '  spokesman Cheung Man-kwong said
district offices would prepare to nominate members for any unpopular regions .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#40:2>
The UDHK and Meeting Point top the nomination of candidates list
with 131 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#41:2>
The Liberal Party has 82 nominations , the ADPL 39 , and the DAB
82 . </p> </I>

<bold> Students see Anson Chan as ideal chief of the SAR </bold> </h>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#43:3>
<bold> By CATHERINE NG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#44:3>
CHIEF Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang is the ideal person to
lead the future Special Administrative Region &obrack; SAR &cbrack;
government , according to university graduates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#45:3>
And Executive Councillor Professor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu is the
most sought-after person to represent the graduates  '  interests in the
Legislative Council , a survey commissioned by the University of Hong Kong
has discovered . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#46:3>
Almost 40 per cent of the 403 graduate respondents chose Mrs Chan
as potentially the &ldquo; ideal-type &rdquo; and most &ldquo; effective
&rdquo; SAR chief secretary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#47:3>
The students thought the second best person for the job &dash;
with 22 per cent of votes &dash; would be Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#48:3>
Other popular choices were legislator Martin Lee Chu-ming ,
billionaire Li Ka-shing and pro-China politician Leung Chun-ying . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#49:3>
&ldquo; The results have emerged to show that the graduates put
more focus on policy areas rather than grassroots issues , &rdquo; said
Anthony Tsui Tin-yau , a member of the panel which organised the survey .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#50:3>
&ldquo; This may explain why Mrs Chan , who has built up a
clear-cut image as an administrator knowing Hong Kong well since her
appointment as Chief Secretary , was elected , &rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#51:3>
The findings also revealed that graduates were concerned about
the spread of corruption after the change of sovereignty in 1997 and about
future constitutional arrangements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#52:3>
The survey also found that most graduates wanted to stay in Hong
Kong . </p> </I>

<bold> Union urges swift pension go-ahead </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#54:4>
<bold> By CATHERINE NG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#55:4>
THE territory  ' s largest pro-China trade union yesterday urged
the Government to go ahead with its old age pension scheme even if it cannot
obtain Beijing  ' s approval . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#56:4>
Chairman of the 210,000-strong Federation of Trade Unions
&obrack; FTU &cbrack; , Cheng Yiu-tong , said he would support the Government
running the scheme unilaterally if discussion between the two sides dragged
on . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#57:4>
He said &ldquo; But support will be given on the condition that
the Government is willing to incorporate our suggestion of launching a
central provident fund in the long run . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#58:4>
Mr Cheng urged the Government to launch the scheme as soon as
possible . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#59:4>
Discussions on a pension fund had been going on for more than 10
years , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#60:4>
&ldquo; When the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are to have
discussions , they should take into account the urgent needs of the elderly ,
&rdquo; he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#61:4>
&ldquo; Though the proposal is not perfect , the two Governments
should go into it according to the actual needs of society . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#62:4>
The FTU said some groups had made unjust criticism of the
proposal over the past few weeks . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#63:4>
Mr Cheng said that many people , from the business sector for
example , would only give consent to the abstract principles behind the
scheme , but would never agree with proposed details for implementation .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#64:4>
He said that some opposition to the scheme was merely based on
consideration that the proposal blurred the concepts of social welfare and
pension schemes . </p> </I>

<bold> Even faction split in Sha Tin </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#66:5>
MAJOR political factions in Sha Tin are confident they can get an
even share of the 31 seats up for grabs in the district board election . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#67:5>
Mak Lam-wing , the Liberal Party spokesman on election said ,
&ldquo; Sha Tin will be a district divided among four major political
factions &dash; the Liberal Party , the United Democrats , Meeting Point and
the Civil Force &dash; and independents . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#68:5>
He said the Liberal Party could secure eight or nine seats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#69:5>
But the United Democrat and Meeting Point candidate , Chow
Wai-tung , said they could have the edge in Sha Tin . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#70:5>
&ldquo; Waving a democratic party flag should be more appealing
to the middle class , which makes up a major proportion of the population
here , &rdquo; said Mr Chow , an incumbent member . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#71:5>
He said it was possible for his party to win more than 10 seats .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#72:5>
Civil Force , a political group representing members without
party background and members with regional influence &obrack; such as those
from rural committees &cbrack; , is a conservative power . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#73:5>
Civil Force convenor , incumbent district board member and
Regional Councillor Lau Kong-wah , said Sha Tin , where 60 per cent of
candidates were independents , was not a place for political parties to fight .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#74:5>
&ldquo; Since the parties have detached themselves from the Sha
Tin residents , playing up the party image will not be helpful for a
candidate to win popularity , &rdquo; he said .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#75:5>
&ldquo; Instead , the quality of the individual will be the major
index to voters . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#76:5>
Mr Lau said many of the 13 Civil Force candidates had served the
district for considerable time .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#77:5>
He was confident their reputations would guarantee them seven or
eight seats . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#78:5>
The pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong
, with only three candidates registered , has a relatively low profile in the
district .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#79:5>
Its office there only opened in June . </p> </I>

HONGKONG Macau Holdings will continue to sell its remaining stake
in Frankie Dominion following its disposal of 3.58 per cent interest in the
company . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#83:6>
Hongkong Macau managing director Wong Sun-man said the company
still held about 7 per cent of Frankie Dominion after the sale last week .
But the interest would finally be relinquished . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#84:6>
The company bought part of the stake when Frankie Dominion was
open for subscription in May .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#85:6>
It then built up its shareholding to around 10 per cent by snapping
up shares on the market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#86:6>
Mr Wong would not divulge if the company had made profit on the
3.58 per cent sale of Frankie Dominion in view of the recent sluggish
performance of the stock . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#87:6>
The disposal was announced last Friday .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#88:6>
After the flotation in June , Frankie Dominion once notched up the
record closing high at &dollar;1.49 after an issue price of &dollar;1 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#89:6>
It tumbled to a 95 cents low last Tuesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#90:6>
Frankie Dominion closed yesterday at 96 cents , down 1 cent .

<bold> Golf course permit hoped for by April </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#93:7>
YOSHIYA International is pinning its hopes on getting Government
approval by April for the establishment of an 18-hole golf course in Yuen
Long . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#94:7>
Managing director Tsang Ping-lam said yesterday that the
construction cost for the golf course was estimated to have risen by up to 10
to 15 per cent because of the year-long delay . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#95:7>
Under the initial plan , Yoshiya would set aside &dollar;330
million for the project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#96:7>
Mr Tsang said the company had recently resubmitted proposals on
the course  ' s traffic arrangements and pesticide use . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#97:7>
These factors were a stumbling block for securing the Government  ' s
go-ahead . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#98:7>
He expected the final approval for the change of the land use
would be obtained by April &dash; before the expiry date for its buy-back
option for one-third of the project . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#99:7>
Yoshiya would have to repurchase the one-third interest from
Omicron International it sold last October should it fail to obtain the
Government  ' s written approval by April . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#100:7>
The golf course , to be built on a 8.6 million square feet site
, will take two to three years to be completed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#101:7>
Although memberships for the golf club had not been formally
sold , Mr Tsang said the response has been enthusiastic as some membership
had already been underwritten . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#102:7>
The operation of the golf club is expected to provide Yoshiya
with a strong cash flow because of the intense demand for membership in the
region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#103:7>
Membership at the Clear Water Bay Golf Club raises about
&dollar;1.5 million annually . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#104:7>
Last November , Yoshiya completed five studies covering sewerage
, drainage , environment , traffic and pesticide application at the request
of the Government . </p> </I>

<bold> Pacific Concord acquires majority stake in Pacpo </bold> </h>
<h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#107:8>
PACIFIC Concord will become the major shareholder of Pacpo
Holdings when it buys an additional 34.72 per cent stake in the company from
Indonesia based Lippo group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#108:8>
The acquisition will see Pacific Concord boost its shares in
Pacpo to 69.44 per cent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#109:8>
The reshuffle came one year after Pacpo &obrack; formerly the E
D &ampersand; F Man Pacific Holdings &cbrack; was jointly acquired by Pacific
Concord and Lippo in late 1990 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#110:8>
Pacific Concord said yesterday it had entered into an
unconditional agreement to purchase 44.54 million Pacpo shares from Evergood
Investments Ltd , a company equally held by Pacific Concord and Lippo .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#111:8>
Following the sale , Lippo no longer holds shares in Pacpo . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#112:8>
The shares were sold for &dollar;1.88 each , a two cent rise
from yesterday  ' s closing price . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#113:8>
The total sale price was &dollar; 83.73 million .

<ICE-HK:W2C-018#114:8>
Since Pacific Concord held half the interest in Evergood , it will
only have to pay &dollar;41.87 million for its increased stake in Pacpo .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#115:8>
In compliance with the Hongkong Code on Takeovers and Mergers ,
Pacific Concord will make a general offer for the Pacpo shares to minority
shareholders at the sale price . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-018#116:8>
It is seeking confirmation from the Takeover Committee on
whether a general offer has to made to shareholders of Pacpo controlled
Hongkong Building and Loan Agency Ltd . </p> </I>
