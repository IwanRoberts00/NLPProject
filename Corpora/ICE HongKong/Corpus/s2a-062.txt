<ICE-HK:S2A-062#1:1:A>
Members of the jury
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#2:1:A>
You would realise the main question to be decided in this case is
whether or not the defendant <.> Chan Wai Ping </.> was the robber in each of
these thirteen robberies <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#3:1:A>
The subject matter of these thirteen charges before you <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#4:1:A>
It is my job to tell you what the law is and how to apply it to
the issues of fact <,> that you have to decide and to remind you of the important
evidence on both issues <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#5:1:A>
As to the law <,> you must accept what I tell you <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#6:1:A>
As to the facts <,> you alone are the judges <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#7:1:A>
It is for you to decide <,> what evidence you accept and what evidence <,> 
you reject or of which you are unsure <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#8:1:A>
If I appear to have a view of the evidence or of the facts with
which you do not agree <,> reject my view <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#9:1:A>
If I mention or emphasize evidence <,> that you regard as unimportant <,> 
disregard that evidence <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#10:1:A>
If I do do not mention evidence that you regard as important <,> follow
your own view <,> and take the evidence <,> and take that evidence into account <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#11:1:A>
You must decide the case only on the evidence <,>  that you have heard
not on speculation about what evidence there might have been <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#13:1:A>
There will be no more <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#14:1:A>
In the case of each witness <,>  consider whether he or she has been
telling you the truth <,> and whether he or she has been accurate in the account given <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#16:1:A>
In the case of each witness you may accept or reject all or some of
what he or she has told you <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#17:1:A>
When you have decided what evidence <,> you are sure is correct <,> it is
for you to decide <,>  what conclusions you are sure <,> you should draw from it <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#18:1:A>
The prosecution must prove the defendant  ' s guilt <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#19:1:A>
He does not have to prove his innocence <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#20:1:A>
Before you can convict the defendant you must be sure of his guilt <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#21:1:A>
That is the same thing as being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
of his guilt <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#22:1:A>
If you have any doubt <,,> as to the defendant  ' s guilt <,> you must
give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#23:1:A>
You must consider the case against and for the defendant <,> on each
count separately and individually <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#24:1:A>
This is particularly so in this case where the defendant is charged
with thirteen counts of robbery <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#25:1:A>
You cannot I repeat you cannot draw any inference from another
count for the count you are considering <,> in order to come to a certain
conclusion <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#26:1:A>
That is to say if you find him guilty of one robbery you cannot
find him guilty of another robbery just because he is guilty of the former
one <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#27:1:A>
Let me emphasise emphasise once more that the case <,>  for and against
against and for the defendant on each count must be considered individually
and separately <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#28:1:A>
In this case there are thirteen counts of robberies in the indictment <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#29:1:A>
The definition of robbery is as follows <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#30:1:A>
A person is guilty of robbery if he steals and immediately before
or at the time of doing so <,> and in order to do so he uses force on any person <,>  or puts or seeks
to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to
force <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#32:1:A>
In short it is dealing with force <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#33:1:A>
Further <,> a person is guilty of theft <,,> if he dishonestly
appropriates property belonging to another with the intention permanently
depriving the other of it and thieve and steal shall be construed accordingly
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#34:1:A>
However for the purposes of this case <,>  it is not disputed that there
were thirteen robberies <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#35:1:A>
The only dispute is whether the defendant was the robber in each of
these robberies <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#36:1:A>
I shall deal with the thirteenth count first <,> as it was how the case was presented to you by the prosecution <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#38:1:A>
The victim of the robbery Madam Pau Yuk Ping <,> told you that <,,> on
the ninth of September ninety-one around eight p m she took the lift at her
home on the twelfth floor six seven o Shanghai Street <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#39:1:A>
She was robbed by a man with a knife about ten inches to one foot long <,> 
on the tenth floor in the lift <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#40:1:A>
She shouted ah three times <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#41:1:A>
Properties taken from her are as follows <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#42:1:A>
Bracelet which was pulled from her from her as the robber found she
was too slow in removing it <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#43:1:A>
It was therefore broken <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#44:1:A>
A necklace with a round jade pendant attached to it
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#45:1:A>
And on the jade pendant there were two Chinese character long life
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#46:1:A>
One on each side <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#47:1:A>
There was one finger ring and a wad of ten dollar notes <,>  about ninety to hundred dollar
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#49:1:A>
She describe the robber as wearing dark blue t-shirt <,>  dark trousers <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#50:1:A>
Something like black
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#51:1:A>
Very thin
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#52:1:A>
Very dark
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#53:1:A>
About five feet four or five inches <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#54:1:A>
Age was something between thirty-five and forty <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#55:1:A>
The robber told her to get out of the lift and he went down in the
lift himself <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#56:1:A>
Madam Pau Pau <.> s </.> shout at the time when the
robbery was heard by PW two <,> Mr Ching Yau Kei the resident of flat B on the
tenth floor <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#57:1:A>
He looked through the spy hole of his main door
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#58:1:A>
He saw a person in the lift took out something and gave it to the
person who kept the lift door open <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#59:1:A>
Then the person inside the lift came out and the person who was keeping the door open went inside 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#61:1:A>
And the lift had gone <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#62:1:A>
He suspected it was a robbery <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#63:1:A>
He telephoned the caretaker <,> PW three Mr Chin Ying Chau and told him
the robbery and the robber was coming down in the lift
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#64:1:A>
He described the robber as wearing dark colour top wear
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#65:1:A>
He could not see his face
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#66:1:A>
He cannot remember his hair clearly
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#67:1:A>
He described the robber was a little bit bald
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#68:1:A>
The caretaker Mr Chin said he received the telephone call from PW
two Mr Ching <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#69:1:A>
About two or three seconds later someone came out of the lift <.> 
se </.> serving the even number of floors
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#70:1:A>
He described that person as follows <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#71:1:A>
Thin build
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#72:1:A>
Male
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#73:1:A>
Age of thirty odd years to forty years old <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#74:1:A>
Black hair of ordinary length <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#75:1:A>
He was wearing dark bluish colour t-shirt and a pair of black
trousers
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#76:1:A>
Height similar to Mr Chin himself <,>  i e five feet four inches or five
inches <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#77:1:A>
He then followed that person to <?> Five </?> Street and Arygle
Street and then to Portland Street <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#78:1:A>
He was about ten odd yards from him and was <,> never out of his sight
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#79:1:A>
He went to a building in Portland Street <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#80:1:A>
Mr Chin followed him up the building <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#81:1:A>
And whilst Mr Chin was in the staircase landing <,> between floor
number two and floor number three he saw him opened the door to floor number
three and went inside <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#82:1:A>
Mr Chin then went back to Shanghai Building and led a
number of police officers to that building later on identified as two two seven Portland street second floor or floor number three <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#84:1:A>
Police knocked and someone on the door and someone open the door
 <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#85:1:A>
Mr Chin entered <,> together with the police <,>  but didn't see the one he
had followed
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#86:1:A>
Then PW four PC four nine three seven eight knocked on the bathroom
door
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#87:1:A>
No one answered
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#88:1:A>
He pulled open the door
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#89:1:A>
Mr Chin then saw said <,,> he saw the person he followed was the one
inside the bathroom <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#90:1:A>
Mr Chin said he was sure because it was a very short moment of
about ten odd minutes after the time he followed him
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#91:1:A>
He told the police that was the man he had followed <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#92:1:A>
That man whom he identifed <,>  turned out later on to be the defendant <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#93:1:A>
He was told to go downstairs and he waited in a police vehicle <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#94:1:A>
He was later on shown some clothings which he identifed as the same
clothings worn by the man he had followed <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#95:1:A>
They were the blue t-shirt <,> and the trousers <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#96:1:A>
He identify them to be Exhibit one o eight and one o nine <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#97:1:A>
Madam Pau were also shown these two exhibits
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#98:1:A>
One o eight and one o nine
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#99:1:A>
She identifed the blue t-shirt was the one worn by the robber and she believed the robber was wearing a pair of trousers similar to Exhibit one o nine
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#101:1:A>
The evidence was that Mr Chin the caretaker said he identified the
defendant <,> as the one he had followed <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#102:1:A>
Members of the jury
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#103:1:A>
This is a trial where the case against the defendant depends <,> 
to a large extent on the correctness of one or more identications of <,> the
defendant which the defence <?> allege </?> to be mistaken
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#104:1:A>
I must therefore warn you of the special need for caution before
convicting the defendant in relying on the evidence of identification <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#105:1:A>
That is because it is possible for an honest witness to make a
mistaken identification <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#106:1:A>
There have been wrongful convictions in the past <,> as the result of
such mistakes <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#107:1:A>
An apparently convincing witness can be mistaken <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#108:1:A>
So can a number of apparently convincing witness
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#109:1:A>
Examine carefully the circumstances in which the identification by
each witness <?> make </?> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#110:1:A>
How long did he have the person he says of the defendant under
observation
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#111:1:A>
At what distance <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#112:1:A>
In what light <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#113:1:A>
Did anything interfere with that observation <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#114:1:A>
Had the witness ever seen the person he observed before <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#115:1:A>
If so how often <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#116:1:A>
In this case of course Mr Chin had not seen the defendant before <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#117:1:A>
If only occasionally had he any special reason for remembering him
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#118:1:A>
How long was it between the original observation and the
identification to the police <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#119:1:A>
There any marked difference between the description given by the
witness to the police when he was first seen by them and the appearance of
the defendant <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#120:1:A>
I must remind you the following specific weaknesses which appeared
in the identification evidence in this case <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#121:1:A>
The caretaker only saw the side of the face of the man when he
came out of the lift <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#122:1:A>
It was only a quick glance <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#123:1:A>
He had never seen this man before <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#124:1:A>
He was following this man at ten odd yards away with people
between them in the street <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#125:1:A>
He only saw his back <?> whilst </?> following him <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#126:1:A>
He ran after that man from Shanghai Building <,> to Mongkok Road <,>  as
that man was also running
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#127:1:A>
And after that both were walking at normal pace <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#128:1:A>
It was <,> about twenty to thirty minutes later when Mr Chin
identified the defendant <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#129:1:A>
The light inside the bathroom door bathroom was quite dim <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#130:1:A>
The light in the doorway where Mr Chin was <,> was more the less the
same i e quite dim which he believed there was a fluorescent light
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#131:1:A>
When the bathroom door was opened he only looked at him for a short while when he identified him to be
the one he had followed <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#133:1:A>
The police officer said defendant was identified by Mr Chin only on
his way from the bathroom to the front cubicle <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#134:1:A>
Defence was that the identification by Mr Chin was a mistaken
identification <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#135:1:A>
Question to be decided by you is whether you are sure the
defendant as identified by Mr Chin the caretaker the man he had followed from
Shanghai Building to two two seven Portland Street <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#136:1:A>
Then you heard the evidence <,> of PC four nine three seven eight PW
four <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#137:1:A>
He was the one who pulled open the bathroom door and found the
defendant inside <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#138:1:A>
He asked the defendant where he had been
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#139:1:A>
And he said he had returned home from work
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#140:1:A>
Then the defendant was asked which cubicle he occupied
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#141:1:A>
He said the front cubicle <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#142:1:A>
Police officer asked the defendant to take them to his cubicle i e
cubicle C on the plan Exhibit one seven seven B <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#143:1:A>
Inside the cubicle police office then asked the defendant which bed
he occupied and he pointed at the upper bed of bed number four <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#144:1:A>
He was asked what clothings he wore when he came home <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#145:1:A>
He then pointed at Exhibit one o eight and one o nine
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#146:1:A>
Blue t-shirt and black trousers
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#147:1:A>
PC one nine two seven two PW six then searched the trousers in the
presence of the defendant <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#148:1:A>
He found the following items <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#149:1:A>
 <?> A </?> bundle of ten ten dollar notes i e hundred dollars in
total
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#150:1:A>
 <?> That is </?> Exhibit one one o
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#151:1:A>
A gold necklace with a jade pendant <,> exhibit one o six
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#153:1:A>
A watch <,> exhibit ninety-two
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#155:1:A>
A gold bracelet <,> exhibit one o seven
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#157:1:A>
And two rings <,> exhibit eighty-four and Exhibit one one one
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#159:1:A>
PC four seven five seven zero then asked the defendant as to how he
obtained those items <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#160:1:A>
He did not answer <,,> the police officer <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#161:1:A>
But members of the jury <,> you must remember that the defendant is entitled to his right to silence <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#163:1:A>
Any person suspected of a criminal offence or charged with one is
entitled to say nothing when he is asked questions about it <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#164:1:A>
You must not hold his silence or refusal to answer question against
him <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#165:1:A>
PC four seven five seven zero then told the defendant he was under
arrest
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#166:1:A>
Defendant put on a top garment and a pair of sports shorts <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#167:1:A>
Suddenly he pushed off PC four seven five zero tried to run away
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#168:1:A>
He was held down by PC one eight five four and four nine three
seven eight <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#169:1:A>
Later PC one nine two seven two showed the items he found in the
trousers and the and the trousers and the blue t-shirt to Mr Chin and Madam
Pau <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#170:1:A>
Madam Pau <,> identified Exhibit one o six as her necklace and the
jade pendant robbed from her earlier on <,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#171:1:A>
The broken bracelet Exhibit one o seven was also shown to her but
she had forgotten about the bracelet as she was <.> ve </.> as she said she
was very frightened at that time <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#172:1:A>
Later on on the fourteenth <?> of </?> September a number of
exhibits were shown to her and she identified Exhibit one o seven was the bracelet robbed form her on the ninth September <,,> 
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#174:1:A>
The defence of the defendant was that on the ninth of September
she went home after work
 
<ICE-HK:S2A-062#175:1:A>
She met <?> uh </?> Mr Chan <?> Hung </?> who was a friend of a
