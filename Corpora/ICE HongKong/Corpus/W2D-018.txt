<ICE-HK:W2D-018#4:1>
Hello !

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#5:1>
I am Andy Lee and I am happy to meet you in <it> Hong Kong Discovery
</it> .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#6:1>
I have been working as a diving equipment maintenance technician at
Pro-Dive for 5 years .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#7:1>
From now on I will explain to you some tips on maintaining diving
equipment in an interactive way .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#8:1>
You are most welcomed to email me at info@hkdiscovery.com for any
questions . </p> <O> Chinese translation and two photos </O>

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#9:1>
<bold> A </bold> regulator is essential for diving .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#10:1>
How do you know about this piece of equipment ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#11:1>
Be observant - any cracks , leakages , funny noises or clogs are
symptoms of dysfunction .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#12:1>
It is important that you take good care of it before it is too late
to be mended . An annual overhaul is therefore imperative . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#13:1>
There are a number of small rigs in a regulator - high pressure
seat , lower pressure seat , diaphragm , filter , dynamic O-Ring , etc which
abrade naturally , though they are more likely to wear quicker under frequent
use .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#14:1>
These rigs are exposed to air pressure , salt-water erosion , debris
and abrasion .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#15:1>
Even if the equipment is unused the rubber parts still wear off .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#16:1>
An overhaul every 12 to 18 months is therefore necessary in which
exhausted rigs are replaced and the whole equipment be opened up for a
thorough cleansing .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#17:1>
Afterwards the equipment is readjusted to suit your individual need .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#18:1>
These are to be done for safety , stability and comfort . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#19:1>
There are several reasons and process for annual maintenance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#20:1>
On top of that a constant upkeep is very helpful in enhancing the
span , efficiency and safety of the regulator , i.e . how to take care of it
after each dive .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#21:1>
This will minimize extra costs for maintenance and will make your
dive more enjoyable . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#22:1>
I will share with you more tips and details on maintaining and
caring your diving equipment .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#23:1>
Don't hesitate to send me an email for any enquiries .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#24:1>
See you soon ! </p>

A challenge , by definition , is not easy .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#30:2>
However , almost anyone who does sports like kayaking , rock climbing
and canyoning will tell you that choosing the way less travelled is often the
most rewarding , and the most fun . </p> <O> Chinese translation and five

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#31:2>
<bold> O </bold> utdoor adventure sports are gaining momentum in
Hong Kong , and the movement is attracting a whole new generation of young
people who are taking up the challenge and going where they have not gone
before .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#32:2>
Adventure races and adventure sport training programmes are springing
up right in our own back yard , and they are creating new opportunities for
kids to get involved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#33:2>
The Bonaqua Youth Challenge held on Hong Kong Island in January
this year inspired over 100 youth 13-19 , who competed in a race of trail
running , kayaking , orienteering , canyoning , rope skills and swimming .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#34:2>
A training day before the race helped to ensure that all racers were
up for the challenge , and possessed the necessary skills and knowledge to
complete the race safely . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#35:2>
Also in January , was the Team Fear Junior Challenge in Discovery
Bay .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#36:2>
This was the second race organized by a dedicated group of Discovery
Bay adventure racers .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#37:2>
Ninety-nine kids , aged 14 and under , competed in a race combining
mountain biking , gorge scrambling and adventure challenges .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#38:2>
The race was a great success and has more than doubled since the
first competition in December , 2001 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#39:2>
Experienced course marshals , safety crew and outdoor professionals
stood by during both races to direct , encourage and support the teams of
young racers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#40:2>
The success of these recent events has given young people in Hong
Kong a taste of the action , and a new definition of what it takes to walk
the walk .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#41:2>
Adventure sports have the potential to offer kids a refreshing way to
develop self confidence , physical fitness , teamwork , a sense of belonging
, responsibility and a deeper understanding of nature . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#42:2>
Training , practice and experience are essential elements of safe
participation .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#43:2>
Training in physical skills; practice under the guidance of
professional instructors and experience in a wide range of outdoor settings
prepares athletes for a lifetime of outdoor sport enjoyment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#44:2>
Programmes like the Kid  ' s Eco-Adventure Challenge , organized by
Dragonfly Limited , are giving young people the opportunity to get a start in
adventure sports , and training participants in a wide range of skills .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#45:2>
The first Kid  ' s Eco-Adventure Challenge was held on Lamma Island in
November 2002 .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#46:2>
Kids and instructors camped out overnight and enjoyed 2 days of
training and adventure sport activities .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#47:2>
Experienced instructors introduced the participants to rock climbing
, mountain biking , trail running , kayaking , caving and orienteering .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#48:2>
More training dates and activities are planned for this spring . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#49:2>
It takes determination , dedication and love for the outdoors to
enjoy a lifestyle that includes adventure sport .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#50:2>
Likewise , the more we do , the more our determination , dedication
and love for the outdoors grows .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#51:2>
It is never too early or late to start .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#52:2>
The next generation of outdoor enthusiasts is emerging .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#53:2>
And , as is the case in all facets of life , they are discovering
that satisfaction comes not just in reaching the destination , but in the
challenge of getting there . </p> <O> Chinese translation </O> <h>

The <bold> THREE-FOLD BENEFIT </bold> of Eco-tourism </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#67:3>
<bold> D </bold> oes eco-tourism make a profit ?

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#68:3>
It makes much more than monetary benefits .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#69:3>
Let me spell out the propitious trilogy of eco-tourism . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#70:3>
Pragmatic - it improves our standard of living .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#71:3>
Immersing yourself in the Nature &obrack;  whether quietly or actively &cbrack; is
the best way to draw yourself from the hurly-burly city life , and to relax
your body and mind and enrich your spirituality in this beatific ambiance .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#72:3>
It allows you to marvel and appreciate the magnitude and wonder of
the natural world and to meliorate your physical and mental well-being .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#73:3>
The nature is also an ideal classroom for environmental and civil
education .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#74:3>
You can never imagine how much you learn , and enjoy , in a
well-organized eco-tour . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#75:3>
Scientific - Eco-tourism enhances the environmental consciousness
in technological development .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#76:3>
Technological advancement accelerates productivity as well as
pollution .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#77:3>
Eco-tourism provides an incentive for the development of green
products , such as vehicles or minimal environmental impact and recycle
systems in lodges .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#78:3>
Renewable energy and the concept of sustainability are the essence of
development of scientific and engineering .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#79:3>
It is sad to see that china has not realized the danger of the
upsurge of the number of cars in the country; but eco-tourism can be the
solution to combat these undesirables by promoting the incentives and
initiatives for green technologies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#80:3>
Artistic - The sensitivity towards our environment is the key to
artistic refinement .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#81:3>
Our artistic sense transcends our daily experience into sublime
sentience .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#82:3>
Look at the havoc and ravages at the Cultural Centre and you see the
poverty of sensitivity in the society .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#83:3>
Eco-tourism arouses our curiosity and admiration towards all things
bright and beautiful , all creatures great and small - this is crucial to our
appreciation of arts and our creativity .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#84:3>
Isn't it wonderful if our kids write a poem about a pheasant they see
during a hike instead of thinking about chicken nuggets ? </p>

Yum cha is universally popular in Hong Kong , especially on a
Sunday , and while many families choose a modern restaurant for their meal ,
one local restaurant has held on to patrons by maintaining a traditional
style . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#89:4>
Famous for its tea and mooncakes , and popular among seniors ,
youngsters and foreigners alike , Lin Heung Tea House is located at 160-164 ,
Wellington Street in Central . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#90:4>
This is an interesting street which combines eastern and western
influences , and has a modern as well as a traditional ambience . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#91:4>
With a western cake shop on one side and commercial buildings on
the other , the marked contrast of Lin Heung  ' s golden brand name on a huge
signbroad makes a vivid impression . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#92:4>
The history of the teahouse can be traced from the late Qing
period . Lin Heung Tea House was first established in Guangzhou .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#93:4>
In 1926 , one of the partners - Yien Lok-tin - opened a Hong Kong
branch on Queen  ' s Road in Central , and another on Canton Road in Mongkok
which was closed 10 years ago . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#94:4>
Lin Heung Tea House arrived in its present neighbourhood in 1996
, but was originally located on the opposite side of the street .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#95:4>
Both Hong Kong shops were run by Yien  ' s family . </p> <O> A photo
</O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#96:4>
The teahouse faced tough times in the 1930s when water supplies
to Hong Kong were limited , and again when the region was disrupted by the
Sino-Japanese war .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#97:4>
China  ' s Cultural Revolution also took its toll in the  '  60s . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#98:4>
Lin Heung  ' s basic business stayed afloat , however , and at
least one long-serving staff member can recall the ups and downs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#99:4>
Former administrator Yien Chi-chung , 83 , took a job as helper
in Lin Heung Tea House when he was 13 years old . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#100:4>
He and Lin Heung grew up together . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#101:4>
He said the company  ' s heyday had been in the years before the
Japanese invasion , but its prestige was restored after the war . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#102:4>
During the water shortages of the 1930s and  '  40s , in order to
keep the business going , staff brought clean water to work with them or drew
water in buckets from a well in what is now Sheung Wan market . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#103:4>
This enabled them to make tea and dim sum , and while they
overcame the water problem , when war broke out the conflict almost finished
the teahouse . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#104:4>
Yien remembered how the company tried to stay open during the
war , but the staff came to work under extremely dangerous conditions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#105:4>
The Japanese fired cannons over Victoria Harbour towards Hong
Kong Island , and a round fell into the teahouse .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#106:4>
The staff hostel above was hit , but no one was hurt . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#107:4>
Anti-Japanese thinking was not allowed under the occupying
regime .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#108:4>
During the occupation Chinese opera companies were invited to
perform in Lin Heung Tea House , but no female singer who performed a
pro-Chinese song was killed along with some of the owners , staff and other
owners .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#109:4>
After that the teahouse was closed until the war ended .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#110:4>
Compared with problems during the war , the riot in 1967 was a minor
event . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#111:4>
Lin Heung Tea House has been famous for decades for its Chinese
wedding cakes and mookcakes .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#112:4>
Especially during the Mid-autumn Festivals , people queue for
mooncakes because the shop  ' s lotus has always been famous for fragrance and
taste . </p> <O> Two photos </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#113:4>
<bold> Atmospheric... the décor reflects a different time ,
above .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#114:4>
Tasty cakes are a speciality , right .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#115:4>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#116:4>
&ldquo; Many senior officials received only Lin Heung mooncakes
as gifts , &rdquo; Yien said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#117:4>
Lin Heung mooncakes with traditional , yellow lotus seed paste
faced keen competition today , however .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#118:4>
Yien said the new generation preferred white lotus seed or cakes
adorned with cartoons of Garfield , Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pool . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#119:4>
As with traditional mooncakes , the Chinese wedding cakes that
remained popular into the  '  70s seemed to have lost their appeal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#120:4>
Traditional cakes implied different sentiments; for example ,
the red liang-su represented good luck , the yellow one brought wealth , and
the white one represented perfection . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#121:4>
In the old days , the rich liked to give as many wedding cakes
as they could to relatives and friends to win prestige and demonstrate their
wealth .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#122:4>
Some brought hundreds of kilograms of cakes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#123:4>
Lin Heung Tea House is decorated in traditional style , with
pendant lamps and fans , Chinese paintings , kettles , and a floor mosaic .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#124:4>
There  ' s one feature in particular you  ' d be unlikely to find in
most restaurants today; Lin Heung still has spittoons sitting around the
floor , although you  ' ll be relieved to know they  ' re not used in the
traditional manner . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#125:4>
The silvery ones look rather like rubber bins , and add a
nostalgic touch . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#126:4>
On a busy weekday you will find crowds of older patrons and
their younger family members .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#127:4>
Executive chef Lung Tim said it was common to see youngsters and
older patrons as well as visitors from overseas having morning tea there ,
simply because there were only two traditional teahouses remaining in Hong
Kong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#128:4>
Throughout its 75-year-history , Lin Heung has preserved a
simple and a old-fashioned style , not only in decoration but also its food .

<ICE-HK:W2D-018#129:4>
For example , pig liver is a favourite with many who enjoy
traditional fare , including local food columnist Choi Lan . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#130:4>
There is also fish head and pig steamed buns , not to mention
the ever-popular dim sum . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#131:4>
Customers include comedy star Chiau sing-chi and Secretary for
Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2D-018#132:4>
To visit Lin Heung Tea House is to leave the present on the
street outside; inside , you can savour Hong Kong  ' s past as well as in any
museum , with the added benefit of delicious food to revive the hungry
historian . </p>
