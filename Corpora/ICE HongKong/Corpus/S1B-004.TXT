<ICE-HK:S1B-004#2:1:A>
In the first part I  ' m going to give you an introduction about our
presentation that is what I  ' m doing now

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#3:1:A>
And after that I will give you a brief accounting background about
Dupont

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#4:1:A>
And later <,> my colleagues Pamela will give uhm some idea uh about
elite sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#5:1:A>
Explain to you what is the Elite Sales Team and why Dupont use such
kind of elite sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#6:1:A>
And then we come to the most critical part

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#7:1:A>
In the last part my other two colleagues Christine and uhm <,> Eliza
would will uhm introduce you the motivation system of Dupont

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#8:1:A>
And <?> you did </?> some theory to explain why Dupont is using this
kind of motivation system to motivate their salesmen

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#9:1:A>
What you may ask why do we focus on uhm why do we put our emphasis
on the motivation part <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#10:1:A>
From this sales performance uhm charts we can find that there are
five great elements which determine the performance of the salesmen

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#11:1:A>
They are personal organisational and environmental variables
motivation skill level attitudes of the salesperson and also roles
perceptions

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#12:1:A>
Among all this five elements motivation is considered as one of the
most important one

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#13:1:A>
Because it it is rate above forty percent of the variants of a
salesperson  ' s performance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#14:1:A>
Okay now I finish the introduction part of our presentation and now
I would like to give you some uhm brief introduction of Dupont <,> company
<,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#15:1:A>
Dupont is one of the oldest and most diversified industrial firm in
the world

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#16:1:A>
Uh few industrial groups today are manufactured the out products
produced or developed by Dupont

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#17:1:A>
The China Hong Kong is one of the most important regional division
of Dupont in Asia

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#18:1:A>
And this is the uh organisational chart of Dupont China Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#19:1:A>
We may see that there are under Dupont there are two main products
territories is oil and chemical and materials

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#20:1:A>
And different departments under chemical and materials are divided
by their products

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#21:1:A>
And we are only propose on this division today

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#22:1:A>
And under each product division they have their own sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#23:1:A>
And these sales team uhm uhm are responsible for their products

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#24:1:A>
Uh you may you may not believe that the total number of Dupont
sales team is only around thirty person <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#25:1:A>
So for more details about Dupont sales team and I would like to
pass on to Pamela to introduce to you

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-004#26:1:B>
Thank you Lily

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#27:1:B>
Now after having an overview of the general background of Dupont
<,> now let focus on the sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#28:1:B>
Dupont sales team is best described as an elite sales team which is
characterized by members ' high education level

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#29:1:B>
For example salesmen in Dupont must be university graduates or at
least polytechnic graduates and if if and in its China office even salesmen
with a master degree or a PhD degree is employed

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#30:1:B>
Moreover salesmen should have business vision and sense

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#31:1:B>
General managerial skills professional selling techniques
analytical abilities tolerance of pressure self-motivation and good time
management

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#32:1:B>
But all these quality seem seem to be that of a manager instead of
a mere salesman

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#33:1:B>
But that  ' s exactly what Dupont want

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#34:1:B>
As one of his group manager said a salesman in Dupont can fulfil
the work of a sales manager in other company

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#35:1:B>
But actually why should Dupont need such an elite sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#36:1:B>
Now uhm it  ' s mainly <unc> a few words </unc> it  ' s because
of Dupont uhm special company philosophy it  ' s market coverage and the role
of salesman in Dupont

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#37:1:B>
First of all we will look at uhm Dupont company <.> poli </.> uh
philosophy

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#38:1:B>
First of all uhm <,> Dupont <,,> Dupont treats buyers as partners

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#39:1:B>
What  ' s that mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#40:1:B>
That means Dupont other than the selling selling products to
different costumers and uh fulfilling their needs <,> moreover Dupont wants
to establish long-term co-operation with their customers

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#41:1:B>
But how to <.> achi </.> achieve this

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#42:1:B>
This is mainly the work of their salesmen

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#43:1:B>
They have to be very clear about the customers uhm the customer  ' s
situation <,> need and difficulty so as to provide appropriate goods and
services for them

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#44:1:B>
And another part that Dupont stress much is that uhm is that the
salesman services should add value to the products that they are selling

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#45:1:B>
In other words when customers buy at Dupont they don't just get
what they have paid for

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#46:1:B>
Instead they will receive a total offering of products and services

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#47:1:B>
A productional services that uhm add that maximise their benefits

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#48:1:B>
To conduct such kind of need satisfaction status salesmen must be
very mature

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#49:1:B>
And also they should apply good communication skills selling
techniques analytical ability and quick wit through intensive training and
exposure to various kinds of knowledge

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#50:1:B>
And then come to the second reason why Dupont need such an elite
sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#51:1:B>
It  ' s <,> uhm it  ' s Dupont  ' s market coverage

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#52:1:B>
Salesman in Dupont have to be responsible for both the Hong Kong
and China market

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#53:1:B>
So and there are uhm different economy uh to assign different time
uh to assign the time and efforts in both of these market

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#54:1:B>
In this case uh they should have the kind of business sense or
vision so as to determine which market are having more potentials and uh so
that they should have put more attention on it

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#55:1:B>
Moreover and salesman in Dupont are not bound by individual  ' s
quota

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#56:1:B>
So they must be self-motivated in order to uhm in order to keep up
with their tight working schedule

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#57:1:B>
And finally uhm the salesman uh in Dupont they also have to take up
part of the managerial work uhm duty in China branch

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#58:1:B>
For example setting programme setting sales forecast for them and
monitoring the China office uhm <.> s </.> programme

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#59:1:B>
Since uh the salesmen have to do such kind of managerial work they
should have uhm managerial knowledge experiences and techniques

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#60:1:B>
Finally uhm we come to the part the role of salesmen in Dupont

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#61:1:B>
As we see a salesman in Dupont equals a sales mangers in other
companies

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#62:1:B>
That means uhm salesman in Dupont have the multiple role of a
manager and a salesman

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#63:1:B>
One example of their working as a manager is that they have to
conduct different market that will have different market of researches <,> so
as to <unc> one-word </unc> the dynamic market trends uh market trend

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#64:1:B>
In this case sales man in fact of being a mere salesman they have
to be an all-round businessman

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#65:1:B>
So as we can see the workload for salesmen in Dupont is really
extremely <,> extremely big the <.> work </.> the workload is really very
heavy and so is the pressure that they have to face

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#66:1:B>
They have to face very different challenges other than that of
selling

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#67:1:B>
So it  ' s no doubt why Dupont should <?> employ </?> an elite sales
team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#68:1:B>
To build such kind of elite sales team is no easy task but to
motivate them is even difficult

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#69:1:B>
So in the following section our team-mate Christine and Eliza is
going to introduce to you the motivation system used in Dupont and why such
systems are effective

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-004#70:1:C>
Thank you Pamela

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#71:1:C>
In this part Lisa and I are going to focus on one point that is how
to motivate such an elite sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#72:1:C>
In the model of psychological determinants of motivation we can
find that there are three elements directly influencing the level of
motivation

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#73:1:C>
Mainly expectancy instrumentality and the balance for the work

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#74:1:C>
Expectancy is the perceived linkage between the increased effort
and the <.> im </.> improved performance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#75:1:C>
And instrumentality is the linkage between improved performance and
the attainment of improvement reward

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#76:1:C>
While the others for reward is the perceived desirability of <,>
receiving more of a particular reward

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#77:1:C>
In the case of Dupont <,> there are various policies and practices
<,> influencing the motivation the process of the elite sales team

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#78:1:C>
Uhm and these factors can explained by the <.> psycho </.> uh
psychological determinants just mentioned

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#79:1:C>
For expectancy Dupont tries to match to make every salesman works
smarter through training and organisation variable

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#80:1:C>
In in regards to training <,> each manager in Dupont has to design
uhm specific <.> pro </.> training programmes for uh each of the salesman of
the subordinating sales team <,> according to the uh job nature and personal
variables

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#81:1:C>
And the relationship between uhm the salesmen and the manager are
very close

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#82:1:C>
And the communication is very good

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#83:1:C>
So the the salesmen can always be consulted

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#84:1:C>
Excuse me

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#85:1:C>
Can always be consulted on their uhm uhm <.> re </.> responsibility
and the autonomy is very harsh

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#86:1:C>
By this way Dupont makes every effort on their salesmen very
effective so that the perceived uh relationship between increased effort and
improves the performance <unc> one-word </unc> is very high

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#87:1:C>
For instrumentality excuse me <,> for instrumentality Dupont
increase the prestige uh sorry increase the uh improve uh the prestige
relationship between improved performance and attainment of increased reward
by compensation and promotion

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#88:1:C>
For compensation Dupont does not have the uhm provision system
instead uhm bonus is given to salesmen of good performance and uh to come to
supplement the high salary

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#89:1:C>
And the most important is however the promotion

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#90:1:C>
Dupont doesn't not promote the salesmen according according to
seniority

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#91:1:C>
Instead salesmen are promoted only when they have good performance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#92:1:C>
And hence the uhm <,> the salesman can easily perceive a higher
relationship between uh improved performance and the attainment of increased
rewards

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#93:1:C>
And how about the values for reward Lisa </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-004#94:2:A>
Income

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#95:2:A>
Taxpayer earns thirteen months salary thirteen months salary of
eight thousand dollars per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#96:2:A>
Eight thousand dollars per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#97:2:A>
And a commission of thirteen thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#98:2:A>
Commission of thirteen thousands dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#99:2:A>
And housing benefit

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#100:2:A>
A housing benefit is granted is provided to the taxpayer in the
form of a housing allowance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#101:2:A>
A housing allowance of two thousand and five hundred dollars per
month is provided to the taxpayer in order to cover <,> the rent he paid

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#102:2:A>
And the rent pay per month is two thousand dollars only

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#103:2:A>
Two thousands dollars only

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#104:2:A>
As you can see in fact the housing allowance is more than enough
okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#105:2:A>
It is more than the rent actually paid by the uh <,> uh by
taxpayer

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#106:2:A>
And in stead that means the excess of five hundred dollars will be
taxed as a <,> cash allowance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#107:2:A>
The five hundred dollars per month will be taxed as a additional
income

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#108:2:A>
Additional income provided by the taxpayer

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#109:2:A>
As well as we have to calculate the rental value of the quarter
provided because this is a full reimbursement of rent paid by the employee

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#110:2:A>
That means a free accommodation must provided by the employer

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#111:2:A>
And in respect of this we have to calculate the rental value

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#112:2:A>
And the next is the allowance expense

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#113:2:A>
There are three hundred dollars uh allowance expense per months

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#114:2:A>
Okay we assume this

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#115:2:A>
And there is an <.> allowa </.> depreciation <.> allowa </.> uh
depreciation allowance available to the taxpayer which is four hundred
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#116:2:A>
Four hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#117:2:A>
Because of only compute once uh depreciation allowance so this is
an annual deduction

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#118:2:A>
Annual <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#119:2:A>
Let  ' s look at the computation

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#120:2:A>
First of all we have to include annual salary employments

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#121:2:A>
Uh in this case thirteen months salary at eight thousand dollars
per month it provided

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#122:2:A>
So the total is one o four thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#123:2:A>
And the next commission income

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#124:2:A>
Thirteen thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#125:2:A>
And next is the excess of the housing allowance

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#126:2:A>
This is treated as an uh cash income an an additional income <,>
in form of cash okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#127:2:A>
So the housing allowance is two uh two thousand five hundred per
uh per month

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#128:2:A>
And the rent pay is two thousand only

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#129:2:A>
So the excess is six hundred dollars <,> for the whole year

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#130:2:A>
This is treated as additional income

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#131:2:A>
So the total income is one hundred and twenty three thousand
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#132:2:A>
This is the total income <,,> before the calculating of uhm rental
value of course

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#133:2:A>
We have not yet calculated rental value

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#134:2:A>
And let  ' s look at the expense first

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#135:2:A>
We know that the deductible expense for the month is three hundred
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#136:2:A>
So the whole year deductible expense is three thousands and six
hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#137:2:A>
And the deflation allowance is four hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#138:2:A>
So the total deductible expense is four thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#139:2:A>
Four thousand dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#140:2:A>
Why do we need to look at the expense first

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#141:2:A>
Because when we calculate the rental value rental value of the
quarter provided or of any subsidising accommodation we have to compute it on
ten percent

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#142:2:A>
Ten percent on the total income as reduce by the <?> allowal </?>
deductions

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#143:2:A>
As reduced by <?> allowal </?> deductions

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#144:2:A>
Uh so make you  ' d you  ' ll uh <.> re </.> you  ' ll remember to
deduct the expense before you calculate the rental value

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#145:2:A>
Otherwise you will uh get the wrong figure for the rental value
included okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#146:2:A>
So you have to deduct the expense first from the <,> from the
accessible income in order to calculate the rental value okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#147:2:A>
So the total accessible from the employer from the employment is
one hundred and forty four thousand nine hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#148:2:A>
One hundred and thirty four nine <.> hun </.> nine thousand
dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#149:2:A>
And then we deduct the expense all the expense available

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#150:2:A>
Efficient allowance and the expense

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#151:2:A>
Four thousand dollars and the net accessible income <,> or the
income after deducting expense from the accessible income is one hundred and
thirty thousand nine hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#152:2:A>
One hundred and thirty thousand nine hundred dollars

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#153:2:A>
So this is the format in computing the income of a taxpayer

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#154:2:A>
Next we  ' ll see another review which is available under salary tax

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#155:2:A>
But this is not an exam this is review

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#156:2:A>
When the <?> front </?> compute uh the accessible income or the
net accessible income of taxpayer we need to deduct the outflowings and
expense as well as the depreciation allowance from the accessible income

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#157:2:A>
And losses will occur losses will occur when the total of the
outflowings and expense <,> and the depreciation allowance exceeds the total
accessible income of taxpayer okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#158:2:A>
For example during the year he has only ten thousand uh income but
his own expense is more than ten thousand then in that case losses will occur
losses will occur

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#159:2:A>
But under sales tax this should be a a <.> s </.> a random uh I
mean a very uhm remote <.> s </.> uh case

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#160:2:A>
This should not happen much okay because under sales tax one
should not incur lot in fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-004#161:2:A>
So this is quite seldom seldomly happen when loss occur </I>
