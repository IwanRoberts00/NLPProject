<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X180:2:Z>
So then you decided to pay <{> him <unc> one word </unc>
you were satisfied </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#181:2:A>
<[> Because he looks like </[> </{> a triad society member

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#182:2:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X183:2:Z>

So how do you think he knew <,> about your <,> family </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#192:2:A>
I think it  ' s from the books not from his own wisdom <,>

And <,> yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X194:2:Z>

Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X258:2:Z>
Although we walked around there was uhm <,> probably about <,>
thirty <,> fortune tellers <{> <[> so we </[> walking around trying to find

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#259:2:A>

And <,> there was one man that I saw that I thought <,> I like
him a lot </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#262:2:A>
Because he looked a fortune teller

Yeah I can just look for a <{> <[> <unc> one word </unc>
</[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X264:2:Z>
He just looked good

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X265:2:Z>
Because he was pretty old and <,> there  ' s nothing <,> specially
uhm <,> <unc> one words </unc> noticeable about him but I just got a

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#266:2:A>
<[> Good design </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#267:2:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X268:2:Z>
But then I decided I didn't want to do it <&>

$A laughs </&> right <{> <[> <unc> three words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#269:2:A>
<[> And your friend </[> </{> do it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X270:2:Z>
I am getting a massage

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X271:2:Z>
<{1> <[1> But </[1> then when I went up to the table <{2> <[2>
<,,> </[2> to pay for the massage there  ' s little slips <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>
right we have to fill out your booth number <,> and the person  ' s name <,,>
and when I got up <{4> <[4> there </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#272:2:A>
<[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#273:2:A>
<[2> Oh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#274:2:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#275:2:A>
<[4> Have </[4> </{4> your mother told me that <,> that don't
don't let <,> anybody you know uh to know the <,> date and the time when you
were born

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#276:2:A>
It  ' s very dangerous

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X277:2:Z>
Really </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#278:2:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X279:2:Z>
Why <unc> one word </unc> I mean I just want to get a
massage that  ' s it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#280:2:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X281:2:Z>
So but uh on the slip <,> there was already they had already
written <,> something I guess <,> <{> <[> and they three words </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#282:2:A>
<[> Uhm <,> why do you </[> </{> have to write down this be
if you are <{> <[> doing a </[> massage

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X283:2:Z>
<[> Cos you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X284:2:Z>
No no

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X285:2:Z>
You paid for a table and they give a slip and then you give that
<,> to the person at the booth <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X286:2:Z>
So <,> they have the slip and it wasn't blank

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X287:2:Z>
Someone has already written on it and then they crossed it out
<{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X288:2:Z>
I </[> guess you know they have decided not to <,> or they made a
mistake or something but the person  ' s name on the slip was that guy <,> that
I was interested in having my fortune told

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X289:2:Z>
And his name was crossed out and they put in <,> you know my
massage session

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X290:2:Z>
So <,> I thought that was kind of interesting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#291:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#292:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X293:2:Z>
Uhm s <&> tut </&> o have you gone to any other fortune tellers
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#294:2:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#295:2:A>
I don't  '  believe in <,> such

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X296:2:Z>
You don't believe in it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#297:2:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X298:2:Z>
I sort of find it kind of interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X299:2:Z>
But <,> when you go get your fortune told you always ask people
about <,> the future </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#300:2:A>
Yeah marriage and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X301:2:Z>
Like you know all your <,> yeah my <,> relationship blah blah
blah blah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#302:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X303:2:Z>
What  ' s gonna happen

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X304:2:Z>
Will I be successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X305:2:Z>
But I have always thought <?> that </?> if I <,> went to talk to
a fortune teller and ask him about the past <,,> what would you ask them </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#306:2:A>
I never think about it <,> and <,> you believe in past

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X307:2:Z>
Well yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X308:2:Z>
I mean if you think about uhm <,> these things that we are
talking about <,> like Abbas  '  class <{> <[> <,> </[> around Benjamin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#309:2:A>
<[> If you </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#310:2:A>
Is that if you <,> believe in past then there must be a recycle
you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#311:2:A>
<{> <[> Then your </[> future will become another person you just
going on and on and on

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X312:2:Z>
<[> <unc> two words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X313:2:Z>
Well I mean think about this </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#314:2:A>
I don't  '  mind if I am going on and on but I  ' m afraid that
one day I will stop you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X315:2:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#316:2:A>
The whole Kat has disappear <{> <[> and </[> it is really
terrible

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X317:2:Z>
<[> Huh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X318:2:Z>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X319:2:Z>
Uhm <&> tut </&> cos you know this is kind of interesting because
<,> think about Benjamin <unc> one word </unc> all the Benjamin that
we  ' ve been reading

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X320:2:Z>
About history images right <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X321:2:Z>
I mean <,> when you I mean you know you what you are asking
fortune tellers <{> <[> <unc> one word </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#322:2:A>
Why is not pronounced as Benjamin

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#323:2:A>
I got a friend

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X324:2:Z>
In German it  ' s Benjamin <,> but in <.> Ameri </.> in England in
American English it  ' s a Benjamin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#325:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X326:2:Z>
But German it  ' s <&> one word </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#327:2:A>
<unc> one word </unc>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X328:2:Z>
<unc> one word </unc> <{1> <[1> <?> with </?> like a Y
<&> laughs </&> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X329:2:Z>
Uhm <&> tut </&> what was I thinking uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X330:2:Z>
Cos when you go to fortune teller you are saying <,> oh will I be
happy <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> really in the future <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X331:2:Z>
And how is happiness gauged

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X332:2:Z>
Will I be marrying or what along the road <unc> one word
</unc> <,> and I mean blah blah blah blah

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X333:2:Z>
But also happiness is a lot is is gauged on <,> your feelings of
happiness right <unc> one word </unc> and happy childhood

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X334:2:Z>
People treated you well <,> you know and and <,> of course the
past is constantly changing <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> so that  ' s the thing that can
be kind of interesting to ask a fortune teller <,> about the past <{4> <[4>
instead of the future </[4> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#335:2:A>
<[1> Ben Yao Min oh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#336:2:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#337:2:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#338:2:A>
<[4> Yeah I have </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#339:2:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X340:2:Z>
Would I be happy in the past </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#341:2:A>
Usually I think the people will ask uh <,> what were I <,>
what was I when I  ' m in the past yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X342:2:Z>
So what were you in the past </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#343:2:A>
I think an uh <.> ki </.> very <,> nice person because I
think <,> uh everybody lives in Hong Kong is very lucky <,> because it  ' s <,>
you know you can

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#344:2:A>
It  ' s <,> to certain extent it  ' s quite fair because you can get
<,> <&> tut </&> what you want if you you know you really devoted to do it
<unc> one word </unc> <&> a pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X345:2:Z>
And <unc> one word </unc> you can get what you want <,>
and what is that

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X346:2:Z>
Can you explain a little </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#347:2:A>
Uhm <,> at least if you try hard <&> a long pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X348:2:Z>
Uh huh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X349:2:Z>
You were saying earlier about uhm <,> <&> tut </&> <,> what  ' s
that <,> you can't let people know your birthday

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X350:2:Z>
It  ' s dangerous

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X351:2:Z>

Like Tower Records

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X400:2:Z>
So do you think shopping is more important than studying or
studying is more important than shopping </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#401:2:A>
If you study more than your shopping is much more interesting
because you can see more things yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X402:2:Z>
That  ' s interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X403:2:Z>
If you study more than you see more when you <{> <[> shop </[>
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#404:2:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> because uh it  ' s the experience uh from
the film culture course

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X405:2:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#406:2:A>

Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#409:2:A>
I think it  ' s much more interesting

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#410:2:A>
You are not just focusing on the <,> uhm on the characters but
also the maybe the techniques <,> maybe your uhm the way the directors use
<{> <[> and some </[> other things yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X411:2:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X412:2:Z>
And then how does it relate to shopping </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#413:2:A>
Maybe uhm <,,> I can't quote right now but sometimes it just
boom and you <,> oh and in you think is oh it  ' s related to my study <,>
sometimes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X414:2:Z>
Can you think of an example </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#415:2:A>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X419:2:Z>
I mean <unc> three words </unc> reading every <unc>
one words </unc> </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X427:2:Z>
<[> She  ' s talking about </[> </{> malls </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#428:2:A>
The malls

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X429:2:Z>
The malls

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X430:2:Z>
Remember when she says it  ' s like <{> <[> a <unc> one word
</unc> walking </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#431:2:A>
<[> I I was late in </[> </{> that lecture

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#432:2:A>
<{> <[> Just talk about other </[> things

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X433:2:Z>
<[> Oh it  ' s terrible </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X434:2:Z>
That  ' s terrible </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#435:2:A>
You you were never late

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#436:2:A>
You were never late in the lecture

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X437:2:Z>
Am I ever late

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X438:2:Z>
Not for my own lectures maybe for other people  ' s </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#439:2:A>
Really

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X440:2:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X441:2:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> says is that there  ' s a certain
experience in the mall right

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X442:2:Z>
It  ' s and she relates it to the arcades <{> <[> <,> </[> when
<unc> six words </unc> where you have shoppers who walk around in an
enclosed space <,> and they consume not only by buying things <,> right

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X443:2:Z>
But they consume <,> visual <,> visually </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#444:2:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#445:2:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X446:2:Z>
<unc> three words </unc> you see as well so you are
consuming through your eyes and that  ' s very much like film

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X447:2:Z>
And so she relates </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#448:2:A>
Then what is the benefit of the you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X449:2:Z>
Well that  ' s the question

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X450:2:Z>
What is the benefit

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X451:2:Z>
And you brought up this idea that by studying more you enjoy
shopping more <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> right

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X452:2:Z>
So I mean one of the one of the <,> immediate <,> response is
that people would say <unc> two words </unc> okay you you do all your
studying <{2> <[2> and </[2> then you get a job and you get more money and
then you can go buy things

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X453:2:Z>
Well but you weren't saying that uh oh I study for ten hours and
then I feel like I need to go <,> relax and so I relax buy shopping

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X454:2:Z>
But you were saying actually by studying <,> you know it opens up
<{3> <[3> some kind of insight on shopping so I want to hear more about that
</[3> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#455:2:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#456:2:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#457:2:A>
<[3> Of course I  ' m not <,> I  ' m not studying in </[3> </{3> order
to shop

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#458:2:A>
Of course not <{> <[> uh </[> <.> s </.> uh it  ' s the main point
and <,> and I think uhm uhm <,,> uhm maybe just talk about other things you
know

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#459:2:A>
If I think of it I  ' ll tell you okay

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X460:2:Z>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X461:2:Z>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X462:2:Z>
So uhm what do you want to talk about then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#463:2:A>
Is it the first time you come to Hong Kong

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X464:2:Z>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X465:2:Z>
I  ' ve been here <,> I don't know how many times

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X466:2:Z>
Probably at least a dozen times </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#467:2:A>
Uhm <&> a pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X468:2:Z>
So talking more than about why you feel so lucky to be in Hong
Kong

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X469:2:Z>
Are you worried about nineteen ninety-seven </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#470:2:A>
Yeah I hate Chinese because when I <{> <[> go to Shenzhen
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X471:2:Z>
<[> You hate Chinese </[> </{> people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#472:2:A>
Yep

So do you hate yourself </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#477:2:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#478:2:A>
I think <{> <[> I  ' m a Hong Kong </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X479:2:Z>
<[> Then your logic doesn't make </[> </{> sense </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#480:2:A>
A Chinese people in Hong Kong is different from a Chinese
people in China

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X481:2:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#482:2:A>

They </[> looked terrible

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#484:2:A>
They just to me they just looked like some <,> thieves or some bad

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X485:2:Z>
<[> The policeman </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#487:2:A>
They don't give me any security any sense of security yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-057#X488:2:Z>
So why do you go to Shenzhen </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-057#489:2:A>
Uh to go to the I don't know if the <,> the name of the <,>
the <,,> something like uh <,> uhm <,> like Ocean Park just <,> just you go
there and you play different things and
