The government makes public one of Hong Kong  ' s best kept
secrets

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#2:1:A>
The pope undergoes surgery in a Rome hospital

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#3:1:A>
And Chinese dissidents appeared at the Democratic National
Convention

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#4:1:B>
Good evening

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#5:1:B>
Thanks for joining us

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#6:1:B>
The government has departed from tradition to disclose how much Hong
Kong has in its exchange fund

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#7:1:B>
And from now on the balance sheet of the fund will be published
every year

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#8:1:B>
Making public one of Hong Kong  ' s best kept secrets is seen as a
move to impress prospective lenders especially for the new airport

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#9:1:B>
Hong Kong  ' s exchange fund until now one of the best kept financial
secrets in town is used to safeguard the territory  ' s exchange rates
stability

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#10:1:B>
At the end of nineteen ninety-one it stands at two hundred and
thirty-six billion Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#11:1:B>
The bulk of which are foreign currency assets worth twenty-nine
billion US dollars equivalent to about two hundred and twenty-five billion
Hong Kong dollars <O> speech by Hamish Macleod Financial Secretary of HK </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#12:1:B>
It gives Hong Kong a per capita foreign currency holding of
five thousand US dollars

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#13:1:B>
The exchange fund has accumulated earnings of almost ninety-nine
billion Hong Kong dollars

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#14:1:B>
This fund is separated from Hong Kong  ' s fiscal reserves of 
seventy-six billion Hong Kong dollars which can be used for public spending

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#15:1:B>
And there  ' s also twenty-five billion Hong Kong dollars excluding
interests in the land fund for the future  ' s Special Administrative Region

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#16:1:B>
Pledging to publish annual balance sheets of the exchange fund from
now on Hamish Macleod obviously saw it as a political move conducive to
attracting lenders for projects such as the new airport <O> speech by Hamish
Macleod </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#17:1:B>
It also reflects the new Open Government Policy <O> statement
by Hamish Macleod </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#18:1:B>
The fund has been kept a secret before for good reason says
Macleod

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#19:1:B>
But circumstances have changed

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#20:1:B>
Hong Kong  ' s monetary framework has strengthened significantly in
recent years so that the territory is less vulnerable to speculative
pressures on the exchange rate

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#21:1:B>
Disclosure of foreign currency reserves is also established
practice in other major market economies

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#22:1:B>
The new governor Chris Patten also hailed the move as a show of
Hong Kong  ' s financial strength

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#23:1:B>
Not least to neighbours to the north <O> speech by Chris Patten
</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#24:1:B>
The senior official of the New China News Agency <?> Cheung
Chung Seng </?> refused to comment

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#25:1:B>
Hong Kong legislators and bankers have also welcomed the disclosure
of the territory  ' s exchange fund

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#26:1:B>
They also say it will serve to strengthen Hong Kong  ' s financial
future <O> speech by Martin Barrow </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#27:1:C>
The figures should be known to the Chinese side long time ago

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#28:1:C>
And uh the government announcing the figures at this time would
serve the purpose of showing to those potential uh financiers who are uh
willing to finance Hong Kong  ' s project

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#29:1:C>
And also it <.> s </.> shows that the Hong Kong government is quite
confident of China  ' s and Hong Kong  ' s political future

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#30:1:D>
A a a good move to tell uh the world basically including the
international financial community that uh we do have a lot of uh reserves and
uh we do have the financial resources to uh meet the uh the need for airport
construction

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#X31:1:Z>
Given the strong fundamentals of Hong Kong economy the Hong Kong
dollar is not going to come under any pressure

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#X32:1:Z>
Uh furthermore <?> was </?> the exchange fund increasing its
control on Hong Kong interest rates

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#X33:1:Z>
Uhm the exchange fund has uh very useful interest rates tool to to
work with in case the Hong Kong dollar comes under pressure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#34:1:A>
The governor says the new airport will be vital to Hong Kong  ' s
economy

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#35:1:A>
This <?> comes </?> as Chris Patten took his first tour at Chek Lap
Kok this afternoon

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#36:1:A>
The first stop for Chris Patten was Kai Tak to see how things are
run there

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#37:1:A>
In the afternoon Patten was flown to Chek Lap Kok where he took the
driver seat of a tractor and was briefed on the progress of the port and
airport projects something he called important to the territory  ' s future <O>
speech by Chris Patten </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#38:1:A>
While at Chek Lap Kok the head of the Provisional Airport
Authority called on Britain and China to get on with the project which is
stalled over financial arrangements <O> statement made by Richard Allen of
the Provisional Airport Authority </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#39:1:A>
This afternoon the New China News Agency Deputy Director said
it  ' s not China  ' s fault there is a deadlock over financing

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#40:1:A>
<?> Cheung Chung Seng </?> says the airport should be built as soon
as possible without any burden to the future SAR

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#41:1:A>
The airport talks resume tomorrow in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#42:1:A>
A study group on the airport  ' s infrastructure has called for the
cancellation of the Rail Link project

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#43:1:A>
The group  ' s convenor said a detailed study of government
information shows that the project would leave Hong Kong with an overwhelming
debt of one hundred twenty four billion dollars by the year twenty ten <,>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#X44:1:Z>
Now if we are going to build this airport railways then we will
left <,> with no money <,> to improve our existing systems to modify our
existing systems and to build these new lines to solve <,> the congestion
problems in the Eastern part of Kowloon City uh <.> Kowlo </.> Kowloon
Peninsula I  ' m sorry as well as the Nathan Road congestion systems </X>

The government is considering new tough measures to fight
cross boarder smuggling even though there appears to be a drop in the number
of cases detected in the past two months <,>

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#46:1:B>
Using the number of sightings of speedboats the most common
smuggling conveyance as a measure the government reported one hundred and
thirty instances in each of the past two months compared with the peak of
fourteen hundred in February and March last year

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#47:1:B>
That was when the anti-smuggling task force was formed

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#48:1:B>
Since then it has arrested a hundred and seventy six people seized
one hundred boats and forty two million worth of contraband <O> speech by
Alistair Asprey </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#49:1:B>
Asprey told Legco the government is considering further laws
to fight smuggling <O> speech by Alistair Asprey </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#50:1:B>
But the most effective measure says Asprey is still to
maintain close liaison with China in sustained action against cross boarder
smuggling

Legco is about to debate the findings of a report calling for
a multi-seats single vote system in nineteen ninety five

Meanwhile outside the Legislature rival groups have turned the
place into a battleground

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#75:1:A>
Peri Chow reports

<$E> 
<ICE-HK:S2B-001#76:1:E>
It appeared that the police were prepared for the noisy
protesters

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#77:1:E>
But the turnout was a staggering sixteen hundred

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#78:1:E>
Barricades were set up and only twenty representatives of each of
the ten groups demonstrating were allowed to come close to the Legco building

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#79:1:E>
The police managed to keep everything in order except for verbal
<?> pressures </?> between the rival groups which don't see eye to eye on the
proposed multi-seat single vote system

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#80:1:E>
Supporters of the system say a voter should be allowed to cast one
ballot regardless of the number of seats in his constituency

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#81:1:E>
They say that will prevent a weaker candidate from winning by
rallying with the stronger candidate

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#82:1:E>
However those on the other side of the fence say the proposed
system will frustrate a voter  ' s choice

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#83:1:E>
They call for referendum on the issue to find out whether a one
vote for one seat is in the best interest of democracy

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#84:1:E>
Other interest groups also aired their grievances today

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#85:1:E>

The Consumer Council is warning the public of damaging effects
of hair dyes to the skin

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#97:1:B>
A council spokesman said samples of hair dyes that claim to produce
permanent effects were found to contain allergy causing chemicals

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#98:1:B>
And only about half of them carry the standard warning label

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#99:1:B>
Most of the permanent type hair dyes <?> are then </?> excessively
high alkaline level which may cause allergy on the scalp

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#100:1:B>
Nearly all of the semi permanent types were found to be either too
acidic or <.> al </.> alkaline

<ICE-HK:S2B-001#101:1:B>
But regardless of their types all twenty five hair dyes tested
were cleared of any potential danger of causing cancer
