<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-002#1:1:A>
Now I hope you still remember the proper way of tackling this
question

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#2:1:A>
I told you already

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#3:1:A>
Uh for any open-end question you have to state very definitely
whether you are for or against

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#4:1:A>
And give reason

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#5:1:A>
Huh

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#6:1:A>
Give reason

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#7:1:A>
Don't try to analyse <&> recording stops and restarts </&>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#8:1:A>
Now for example just like girls suppose I say <,,> do you think
secondary students should <,> have steady boyfriend or girlfriend something
like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#9:1:A>
Now you answer this question <,,> you have to make it very clear
from the beginning

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#10:1:A>
I think <,> secondary student should not <?> have </?> steady
boyfriend or girlfriend

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#11:1:A>
And then <,> what follows are all the reason <,> to support your
disapproval of <,> secondary student having boyfriend or girlfriend

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#12:1:A>
Steady boyfriend or girlfriend

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#13:1:A>
Understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#14:1:A>
Nah don't start <,> list out all the advantages and the
disadvantages

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#15:1:A>
Uh because <,> if if the question put in this way <,> what are the
<,> advantages and disadvantages then you  ' ll prove it

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#16:1:A>
But if it ask for your opinion <,> now you  ' ll have to choose to
make your choice first

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#17:1:A>
Yes or what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#18:1:A>
No

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#19:1:A>
And then follow your trend

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#20:1:A>
Understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#21:1:A>
Nah otherwise if many <,> many time the people student they try to
what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#22:1:A>
Analyse the question instead of answering the question

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#23:1:A>
Give all the pros and all the cons

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#24:1:A>
And only finally one <,> statement

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#25:1:A>
I think sometime is okay you know if depends on individual case
then uh you get the mark

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#26:1:A>
Is it clear girls you have to be very clear with your what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#27:1:A>
Your fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#28:1:A>
All right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#29:1:A>
Nah this type of question I told you already

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#30:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#31:1:A>
Now let  ' s continue with the topic in care for the old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#32:1:A>
I think we have nearly finished everything except the Bible
passages <,> tell us very clearly the Christian perspective or the typical
view point or what what other shall we say

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#33:1:A>
Uhm <,,> the teaching according to the Bible right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#34:1:A>
All these different things regarding care for the old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#35:1:A>
So now girls have I given you the tips already

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#36:1:A>
Okay let  ' s look at that one

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#37:1:A>
Now care for the old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#38:1:A>
Now before I go on any question

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#39:1:A>
Now let us look at <,> the message given here <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#40:1:A>
Very direct

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#41:1:A>
Very clear cut

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#42:1:A>
You can see huh

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#43:1:A>
Very direct and very clear cut

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#44:1:A>
The first passage is taken from Leviticus <O> take-off or landing
sound </O> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#45:1:A>
<unc> a few words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#46:1:A>
Okay versus thirty two

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#47:1:A>
Only three line

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#48:1:A>
Which do you think are the key words here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#49:1:A>

<$Z1> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#X50:1:Z>
Respect </X>

<$A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#55:1:A>
The key words about

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#56:1:A>
Now <,> like here <quote> Why fear me I am the Lord </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#57:1:A>
Now let us look at this

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#58:1:A>
From the Old Testament or the New Testament

<$Z2> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#X59:1:Z>
Old </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-002#60:1:A>
In the Old Testament

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#61:1:A>
<quote> Now you understand why they do fear me </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#62:1:A>
Now actually what does it mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#63:1:A>
They talking about all that all the time

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#64:1:A>
Why did they all use the word <quote> fear me </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#65:1:A>
What does that mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#66:1:A>
It is in those days understand uh it is the way that <,> <.> p </.>
people will be what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#67:1:A>
Listen would be convinced

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#68:1:A>
Understand uh they use the word fear doesn't really mean really
like what you have so scared of

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#69:1:A>
You know

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#70:1:A>
The the word fear in those days <,> actually more of the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#71:1:A>
Aspect

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#72:1:A>
Understand <O> A Cantonese explanation of  ' fear ' used in the Bible
</O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#73:1:A>
Do you understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#74:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#75:1:A>
Nah for here even the three sentences here tell us to <,> not just
to respect them but to honour them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#76:1:A>
Now of course girl if I want ask you to elaborate <,> you must be
able to ask why do we have to honour the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#77:1:A>
Come on

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#78:1:A>
Although it don't say here why do we have to honour the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#79:1:A>
Uh who would like to answer this question

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#80:1:A>
Suppose I say <,> the Leviticus tell us to show respect and honour
the old people why

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#81:1:A>
Nobody knows

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#82:1:A>
And what is <,> the fact the the the point of having all these
lessons we  ' re talking about care for the old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#83:1:A>
Why do we have to honour the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#84:1:A>
When you honour somebody that means somebody is really worth for
you to what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#85:1:A>
To honour

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#86:1:A>
Why

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#87:1:A>
Come on <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#88:1:A>
Always like this to put your head down you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#89:1:A>
Now don't forget even if you put your head down I still can call
you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#90:1:A>
You have a sitting chart here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#91:1:A>
Nah I must admit I cannot <,> know I still do not know all the
names of all of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#92:1:A>
Only you know a number of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#93:1:A>
So it  ' s no point putting your head down

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#94:1:A>
Doesn't help

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#95:1:A>
Come on

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#96:1:A>
Why do we have to honour the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#97:1:A>
Just a simple question

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#98:1:A>
You will be you should help your blessing if you all of a sudden
get this question for the test or an exam

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#99:1:A>
Nobody can answer me huh <,,> <O> take-off or landing sound </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#100:1:A>
Ida <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#101:1:A>
Right because they have done their part

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#102:1:A>
They have contributed to what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#103:1:A>
Society

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#104:1:A>
Understand uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#105:1:A>
They have played their role

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#106:1:A>
Understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#107:1:A>
And <unc> two-words </unc> <?> fulfil </?> their role <,>
nurturing the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#108:1:A>
Nurturing the young

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#109:1:A>
Do you understand this is most important part

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#110:1:A>
Without them how can you the younger generation

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#111:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#112:1:A>
The next one

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#113:1:A>
The next paragraph <,> show appreciation for the aged parents

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#114:1:A>
Now look <,> for the first passage is in fact the second paragraph
to show its appreciation

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#115:1:A>
Now <,,> versus twenty two

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#116:1:A>
Ask them what <quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#117:1:A>
Listen to your father

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#118:1:A>
Without him you would not exist </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#119:1:A>
Yes or no

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#120:1:A>
Why do we have to show our <.> appre </.> appreciation

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#121:1:A>
Well without your father actually without your parent you will not
be here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#122:1:A>
Also <quote> when your mother is old show her the appreciation
</quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#123:1:A>
Now if they find it funny <,> how come

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#124:1:A>
It separate the father and the mother don't forget they always
mention father first because again is a male-dominating society at that time
right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#125:1:A>
Now then go on <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#126:1:A>
Versus twenty four <quote> you have to </quote> why if you uh
<quote> to show appreciation and do the right thing your father your parents
should be happy because they can take pride in a wise son </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#127:1:A>
Is this true

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#128:1:A>
If you do well if you do well

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#129:1:A>
Do you think your parent will feel proud of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#130:1:A>
Yes or no

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#131:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#132:1:A>
They have always say this suppose <,> they were receiving award
understand uh they came first that they did a great job <,> the parent they
feel so proud of them right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#133:1:A>
And then they answer to what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#134:1:A>
<quote> Make your mother make your father and mother proud of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#135:1:A>
Give them or give or mother back </quote> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#136:1:A>
Actually girls there  ' s a very good verse in Proverb in the verse
twenty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#137:1:A>
It is not printed here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#138:1:A>
But I like that very much

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#139:1:A>
That Proverb verse goes like this <quote> we admire the strength
of youth </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#140:1:A>
All right because young people always full of what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#141:1:A>
Strength

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#142:1:A>
Full of energy like <.> f </.> full of vitality

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#143:1:A>
<quote> And we will respect the grey hair age </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#144:1:A>
Now you see the the <,> when you are young you admire <,> but when
you come to the grey hair age to what we have to what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#145:1:A>
Respect

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#146:1:A>
And actually I think I did say this before

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#147:1:A>
I want to repeat

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#148:1:A>
Now when you want to give your <,> parent happiness <,> in a way
you are giving yourself happiness

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#149:1:A>
Now remember told you I told you once to pay attention what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#150:1:A>
When we pray for our parent actually we are praying for what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#151:1:A>
For yourself

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#152:1:A>
Because suppose we say we ask God to bless our parent to give them
good health okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#153:1:A>
So is it in a way you ask God to bless

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#154:1:A>
Uh if your parents are in good health you don't have to worry

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#155:1:A>
Yes or no

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#156:1:A>
Uh you don't have to spend so much time okay uh you looking after
them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#157:1:A>
Do you understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#158:1:A>
So you could use your time to do something else

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#159:1:A>
So it is that you are asking God okay to bless <unc> two words
</unc> <O> take-off or landing sound </O> always to do that

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#160:1:A>
It  ' s not just your parents

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#161:1:A>
If you ask God to bless <unc> a few words </unc> <O>
take-off or landing sound </O> I bet you all know that okay <unc> a few
words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#162:1:A>
Now the second thing

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#163:1:A>
<quote> The Church should help those who are alone </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#164:1:A>
Now what does this

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#165:1:A>
This seems to be the same idea as we what say

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#166:1:A>
The government should what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#167:1:A>
Should look after old homeless childless what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#168:1:A>
Elder the elderly

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#169:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#170:1:A>
The same thing here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#171:1:A>
But in those days of course do you know that girls in those days
in those uh in those in those days community Church plays a very important
part

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#172:1:A>
Church is actually like the head figure okay of the authority

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#173:1:A>
Understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#174:1:A>
Right now so you see <,> nah it says that <,> <quote> if any
Christian woman has widows in her family she must take care of the and not
put the burden on the Church </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#175:1:A>
Now what does this apply to

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#176:1:A>
What we have been saying

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#177:1:A>
Come on

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#178:1:A>
It  ' s the same as what have said

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#179:1:A>
<quote> But the widow if any Christian women </quote> <,> again
<?> women </?> is actually could refer to family <quote> has widows in her
family </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#180:1:A>
Widow means somebody who has lost her what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#181:1:A>
Husband

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#182:1:A>
And nobody to look after

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#183:1:A>
<quote> But if their family lack member </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#184:1:A>
What does that mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#185:1:A>
<quote> They must be taken care of </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#186:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#187:1:A>
And don't put the burden on what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#188:1:A>
Church

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#189:1:A>
This is exactly what the government is trying to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#190:1:A>
Encourage those <,> elderly to live with the family so that the
family take up the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#191:1:A>
Responsibility <O> take-off or landing sound </O>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#192:1:A>
But underline

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#193:1:A>
Nah they say that <quote> not that the Church is so unhelpful but
the Church would like to keep </quote> understand uh <,> <quote> their
resources to help </quote> the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#194:1:A>
<quote> Take care of the widow who are all alone </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#195:1:A>
So now you see can see in those days uh their way of thinking is
actually similar to ours

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#196:1:A>
Listen uh <quote> those with the family family should look after
them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#197:1:A>
Those without family the Church </quote> you know the church or we
say the government uh <quote> should to take up the <,> responsibility
</quote> right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#198:1:A>
The next two passages girls

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#199:1:A>
<quote> The younger generation should care for the older
generation </quote> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#200:1:A>
So girls you see what we  ' re <.> talk </.> talking about that they
are all what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#201:1:A>
Shown in the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#202:1:A>
Bible passages

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#203:1:A>
Okay now all these value

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#204:1:A>
Now it  ' s taken from Ruth

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#205:1:A>
Now uh Ruth is a book in what testament again

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#206:1:A>
Do you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#207:1:A>
The Old Testament

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#208:1:A>
Now do you know who is this Ruth

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#209:1:A>
R U T H

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#210:1:A>
Okay now it is a Ruth is a very good woman

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#211:1:A>
And he is she is so good that she  ' s willing to look after her
mother-in-law

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#212:1:A>
Now not her own mother but her husband  ' s what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#213:1:A>
Mother

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#214:1:A>
Even after the death of what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#215:1:A>
Husband

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#216:1:A>
Understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#217:1:A>
Very generous

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#218:1:A>
Now and this woman show concern and care to old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#219:1:A>
She is loyal and faithful to her mother-in-law

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#220:1:A>
She is every humble

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#221:1:A>
Very courageous

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#222:1:A>
Very generous

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#223:1:A>
This woman huh

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#224:1:A>
Actually very similar to <,> the very traditional daughter-in-law
in the Chinese society

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#225:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#226:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#242:1:A>
Seventy times seven

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#243:1:A>
Something like that

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#244:1:A>
Oh whether is seventeen times seven or seven it still a number

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#245:1:A>
But it doesn't mean Jesus doesn't mean that even seventeen times
seven <unc> three words </unc> four times four <unc> two words
</unc> finish

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#246:1:A>
Not that

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#247:1:A>
That means seven means many times already okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#248:1:A>
If seventy times seven means what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#251:1:A>

mother-in-law because the grandson <quote> will bring you life to you and
give you security in your old age </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#255:1:A>
Now what does that mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#256:1:A>
What does this mean

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#257:1:A>
That means this Ruth is so good not as she herself has looked the
old woman

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#258:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#259:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#264:1:A>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#265:1:A>
Now actually what this mean here

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#266:1:A>
We have to love the old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#267:1:A>
And not just say that you love them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#268:1:A>
Just sit there you know opposite to them I love you I love you it  ' s
no use

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#269:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#270:1:A>
Love them make them feel what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#271:1:A>
Secure and comfortable and happy

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#272:1:A>
Uh I think we talked about this

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#273:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#274:1:A>
You don't just <,> put them at home and say okay now look <,>
there  ' re food in the refrigerator

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#275:1:A>
There you know is a room for you to live you know what else do you
want

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#276:1:A>
Now even if if your attitude is like this

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#277:1:A>
Do you think they feel secure

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#278:1:A>
They don't feel secure

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#279:1:A>
Because you don't show that you are so willing you are willing
understand uh

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#280:1:A>
It  ' s the willingness that you want to show the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#281:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#282:1:A>
Right now the next passage about Timothy

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#283:1:A>
Now underline its versus wait versus <,> four

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#284:1:A>
Versus four <,> which is <quote> if a widow has children or
grandchildren they should learn first to carry their religious duty towards
their own family and </quote> underline <quote> this way repay their parent
and grandparent </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#285:1:A>
Repay <,> now <quote> repay their parent and grandparent </quote>
how do they repay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#286:1:A>
Of course <,> that means what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#287:1:A>
Look after them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#288:1:A>
Take care of them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#289:1:A>
<quote> Because that is what pleases God </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#290:1:A>
Simply tell us they are doing this because that  ' s what God wants
you to do

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#291:1:A>
And you know in those days understand uh <,> the way to argue you
think that look you have to do what what want you to do or else you will be
what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#292:1:A>
Punish

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#293:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#294:1:A>
So uh this is the way now

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#295:1:A>
Further down versus eight <,> <quote> but if anyone does not take
care of his relatives especially the members if his own family </quote> now
<quote> he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#296:1:A>
Now this make it very clear cut

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#297:1:A>
If you are a Christian <,> if you are a Christian what do you do

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#298:1:A>
Looking after family member especially the old ones

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#299:1:A>
In that case your what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#300:1:A>
Duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#301:1:A>
D U T Y

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#302:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#303:1:A>
Now if you don't do it <,> you will be even worse than a what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#304:1:A>
Unbeliever

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#305:1:A>
That means you are non-Christian

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#306:1:A>
Now because being a Christian is your duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#307:1:A>
And if you don't do it that mean you don't perform the duty of a
Christian

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#308:1:A>
So what is the difference between you and an non-Christian

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#309:1:A>
Do you understand Donna

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#310:1:A>
After this passage you could see very clear that according to the
Christian perspective <,> we should have to respect the old honour them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#311:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#312:1:A>
Uh the young one should what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#313:1:A>
Take care of the old one

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#314:1:A>
Make them feel secure happy

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#315:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#316:1:A>
Be loyal to them

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#317:1:A>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#318:1:A>
Because this is you are not doing them a favour

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#319:1:A>
Because this is our what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#320:1:A>
Duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#321:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#322:1:A>
This is our duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#323:1:A>
That something we should do

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#324:1:A>
Now the last last uh passage God care for people when they are old

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#325:1:A>
Now versus four <quote> I am your God </quote> <,> now actually uh
wait a minute uh second line of versus three <quote> I have cared for you
from the time you were born

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#326:1:A>
And I  ' m your God and I will take care of you until you are old
and your hair is grey </quote>

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#327:1:A>
Now this is the reassurance given to God I mean given by God to
the old people

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#328:1:A>
So the people so people in general think that the day when you
were born the God uh God has already what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#329:1:A>
Blessed you taking care of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#330:1:A>
So when you get old God will look out

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#331:1:A>
Nah then you say how

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#332:1:A>
How can God look out

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#333:1:A>
Actually what this means

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#334:1:A>
God will make sure those who believe in him know their duty

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#335:1:A>
Understand uh the young one to look after the what

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#336:1:A>
The old one

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#337:1:A>
That if they they perform the will of God

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#338:1:A>
You got it

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#339:1:A>
So it  ' s quite straight forward these passages you know

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#340:1:A>
Nothing uhm difficult to understand

<ICE-HK:S1B-002#341:1:A>
