<ICE-HK:W1A-007#2:1>
Introduction </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#3:1>
<p> <ul> The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life </ul> , first published
in 1912 , adopted the method of in-depth examination of one good case
&obrack; in Australian totem clan &cbrack; in order to develop a thesis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#4:1>
As a functionalist , <-> Drukheim </-> <+> Durkheim </+> mainly
studied the Australian totemism and it functions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#5:1>
Now I will try to have a brief look at these aspects and try to apply
his view of the point concerning to function of religion to modern societies
especially in Hong Kong . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#6:1>
<h> II . Definition of Religion </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#7:1>
<p> Firstly <-> Drukheim </-> <+> Durkheim </+> divided all societies into
two world . <quote> <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#X8:1>
&ldquo; . . in the present day just as much as in the past , we see
society constantly sacred things out of ordinary ones . &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#9:1>
One was sacred world in which the things were considered superior
dignity and power to profane which meant our daily life .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#10:1>
The profane things should not touch the sacred things which also
cannot touch with impunity so that these two world are not able to
communicate with each other . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#11:1>
<p> There are two different religious phenomena which are beliefs and rites .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#12:1>
&ldquo; The first are states of opinion , and consist in
presentations&semi; the second are determined modes of action &rdquo; </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#13:1>
<p> Church is a place where a group of believers gather together to carry out
the regular religious ceremonials .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#14:1>
When they are in the church , they feel in contact with higher forces .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#15:1>
The reason for this , according to Durkheim  ' s explanation ,
ceremonials take people from profane into scared world . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#16:1>
<p> From the above-mentioned Durkheim  ' s assumption , there are the
interaction between the sacred things <-> . </-> <+> , </+> ritual , beliefs
and church .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#17:1>
So the definition from Durkheim is :

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#18:1>
<X> <quote> &ldquo; A religion is a unified system of beliefs and
practices relative to sacred things , that is to say , things set apart and
forbidden - beliefs and practises which unit into one single moral community
called a church all those who adhere to them . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#X19:1>
</quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#20:1>
<p> The reason why Durkheim did not use supernatural or God to definite
religion is that some religions have no God or supernatural but they only
have some orthodox principles .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#21:1>
For example Buddish , they have four gospels but they have no god or
supernatural . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#22:1>
<h> <bold> III . Brief look at totemism of Durkheim  ' s ideas </bold>
</h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#23:1>
<p> Durkheim believed that totemism was the simplest religion in the world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#24:1>
The reason why totemism is religion that the beliefs and rites are
same as other religion but the difference of totemism with other religion is
primitive and simplest religion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#25:1>
Durkheim firstly study and analysis the simplest and primitive
organisation and religion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#26:1>
From his study , totemism revealed the characteristics or essence of
religion which could extend and apply to other religions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#27:1>
As a result , he based on these to set up his religious theory . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#28:1>
<p> The basic concept of totemism is the identity it established for the clan .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#29:1>
The members of clan have not blood relationship but they still
considered themselves united by a bond kinship .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#30:1>
It is because they relate themselves to one kind of animal or plant
&obrack; totem &cbrack; which is represented their clan .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#31:1>
They share the name of the totem to identify their own
characteristics from other clans .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#32:1>
Besides , the totem of clan , there are other types of totemism such
as individual totem . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#33:1>
<p> A totem is a sacred thing which symbolizes two different sort of things ,
that is the visible form of god and their clan .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#34:1>
It is at once the symbol of god and of the society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#35:1>
Durkheim suggests that in worshipping god , men are in fact
worshipping society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#36:1>
Society is the real object of religious veneration .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#37:1>
The reason for why man does not simply worship society itself but
worships a sacred symbol like a totem is that it is easier for him to
visualize and direct his feeling of awe toward a symbol than toward so
complex a things as a clan . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#38:1>
<p> Durkheim explains that in the primitive clan , the members have religious
ceremonials to worship the totem which is a sacred thing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#39:1>
Within these ceremonials , people feel excited through the song and
dancing and they cannot control themselves .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#40:1>
At the time , they only feel that they are dominated by a sort of
eternal power which may be the god or totem or supernatural and they are
seemed to transfer form their moral and daily world into the different world .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#41:1>
According to Durkheim this sort of eternal power is from the
gathering of the members - society power . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#42:1>
<p> The religious ceremonials of totem can group the members of clan together
who live separately at the definite time regularly .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#43:1>
Totem as the symbol of their clan , can serve the members to express
their feelings of dependence on each other and their moral identity .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#44:1>
According to Durkheim , people must follow the rules or laws which
they think that it is sacred principles .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#45:1>
In fact , these sacred principles just is the rules or regulations of
society so that the society can carry out normally and prosperously .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#46:1>
Therefore society can bind the people together and regulate the
behaviour of people through the religion . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#47:1>
<h> <bold> IV . Religion Function </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#48:1>
<p> Durkheim as a functionalist concerned with the contribution religion
makes to meet the function prerequisites or basic needs of society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#49:1>
From thesis perspective society requires a certain degree of social
solidarity , value consensus , harmony and integration between its parts .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#50:1>
Therefore Durkheim analyses religion which has three main functions :

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#51:1>
1. social solidarity ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#52:1>
2. regulating social relationships and maintain the social order ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#53:1>
3. moral authority . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#54:1>
<p> 1. Social Solidarity :

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#55:1>
Beliefs and rites performed by religion can encourage people to
communicate their ideas and sentiment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#56:1>
Religion can group people together .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#57:1>
The believers are called to participate in some religious ceremonials
at definite time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#58:1>
Religion provides a union in which people have the some religious
beliefs and the same value .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#59:1>
Therefore it can strengthen social bond . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#60:1>
<p> 2. Maintain the Social Order :

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#61:1>
According to Durkheim , rites can regulate the social relationship
and maintain the social order . </p> <X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#X62:1>
<quote> The Different types of rites are contributed to regulate the
behaviour of people and maintain social order &rdquo; </quote> </X>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#63:1>
<p> The different sorts of rites achieve the ends - maintaining the stability
of society through the religious taboo .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#64:1>
For example , in some clans in Australia , when a man died , his wife
and his brothers  '  wives should reticence .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#65:1>
And even the members of the clans cannot eat the plants or animals
which are the totem of the dead man .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#66:1>
That is some totem taboo for the member of clan to follow so that it
can inflect the people who are respect to the dead man through the religious
rites .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#67:1>
Thus we can see that the rites can regulate the behaviour of people
who can follow the different kinds of rites in different conditions such as
funeral or marriages .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#68:1>
As a result , under the taboo of religion , the social order can be
maintained . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#69:1>
<p> 3. Moral authority :

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#70:1>
Religion may provoke the change of society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#71:1>
The value of religion enact some standard of morality in the society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#72:1>
For example , 60  ' s in the 20 century , people struggled for the
right of citizen and the anti-war movement which were based on the religious
beliefs : the peace and the close-relationship with each person .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#73:1>
People use the religious value as the moral standard to examine the
existing social system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#74:1>
If they find that there is something unreasonable , they may
challenge the society according to the moral authority - religion . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#75:1>
<p> The above-mentioned functions are beneficial in integrating the
individual into society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#76:1>
According to Durkheim , <quote> &ldquo; . . moral control of the will
could lead to a flowering of the individual within a supportive social order . .
&rdquo; </quote>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#77:1>
Therefore religion as moral control can help to maintain the
solidarity of society and social order . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#78:1>
<h> <bold> V . Try to apply religion function to modern societies
</bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#79:1>
<p> Durkheim  ' s view of religion functions sometimes can apply to modern
societies appropriately but sometimes it cannot .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#80:1>
In fact , in modern societies , most of religions would have their
own moral beliefs .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#81:1>
Although different religions have different origins and doctrines ,
their main moral beliefs such as equality , freedom , love , kindness ,
helpfulness and so forth .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#82:1>
Thus , it become a moral authority which can strengthen social bonds
and regulate social relationship . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#83:1>
<p> Totem symbols the supernatural of the member of the clan on the surface
but , according to Durkheim , totem symbols the societies which are
worshipped by the believes .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#84:1>
Besides , the Chinese Religions in Hong Kong , there are some symbols
represented the supernatural/god such as the figure of Wong Tai Sin in the
Wong Tai Sin Temple .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#85:1>
From this mention , that is similar to the totem as the symbols .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#86:1>
Certainly , the two religions &obrack; Totem and Chinese Religions
&cbrack; are the sacred things which cannot be touched by the impure things .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#87:1>
<p> The relationship between the totem and the Chinese religion is that totem
affects the development Chinese religions .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#88:1>
In the primitive age , some Chinese clans use some objects which are
sacred thing to represented their god or their clans .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#89:1>
For example , some clans in Sichuan , the member of the clans use
&ldquo; white rock &rdquo; as totem represent their supernatural .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#90:1>
Their aim at worshipping the &ldquo; white rock &rdquo; is to expect
their supernatural to protect them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#91:1>
In my opinion , the totem religion affects the development of Chinese
religions . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#92:1>
<p> I try to apply Durkheim  ' s ideas in some Chinese religion in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#93:1>
I cited Bun Festivals in Cheung Chu as example in which his ideas can
apply . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#94:1>
<p> I explain that the aim of this festivals is to feed and pacify the
wandering spirits of dead , which will bring diseases and misfortune to a
community .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#95:1>
Through the festivals , inhabitants and the society will be harmony
in the island . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#96:1>
<p> These festivals that involves a series of religious rites and elaboration
rites within 3 days is carried out at the middle of May each year .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#97:1>
They worship the papiermache figures represent their god which can
protect them from the diseases .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#98:1>
Moreover there are some elaboration rites such as grand parade and
scrambling of the bun towers in which Cheung Chu people feel excited just
same as the clan in Australia , where the member of clan feel excited through
the totem rites such as dancing and singing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#99:1>
All people in Cheung Chu must attend the festivals . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#100:1>
<p> According to the above mentioned , we can see that this festivals has its
social function to group people together and the aim is to give the harmony
in the island .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#101:1>
In other words , it can strengthen the social solidarity in Cheung
Chu . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#102:1>
<p> But there are some Chinese religions , Durkheim  ' s ideas cannot apply in
them appropriately such as worshipping the Wong Tai Sin Temple or the rock
which seem as a god of marriage .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#103:1>
The social function of this religion is that the powerful deities
can help people reduce their anxieties .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#104:1>
In other words , it can satisfy the individual needs . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#105:1>
<p> I cited worshipping to rock which represent the god of marriage as
example .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#106:1>
People do not group together to join the religious ceremonials but
they worship to the god/supernatural individually .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#107:1>
Although there is a special day for worshipping that supernatural ,
people do not go to there at the same time and there is no communication
between worshippers during their religious rates . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#108:1>
<p> From the above-mentioned , the social function is different from the
Durkheim  ' s ideas - mainly strengthening the social bonds .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#109:1>
Therefore Durkheim  ' s thesis cannot apply in some Chinese religions .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#110:1>
<p> In small traditional cultures , according to Durkheim , almost all
aspects of life are spread by religion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#111:1>
Thus Durkheim emphasizes the religion is the most important factor
to promote social cohesion rather that other aspects such as education . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#112:1>
<p> However , many sociologists belief that modern societies are undergoing a
process of secularization &obrack; means that a process of decline in
religious activities beliefs , ways of thinking and institution that occurs
with social structural change . &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#113:1>
On the other hand , according to some sociologists , other
institutions like education and economic institutions are increasing their
significance to strengthening social bonds and regulation social relationship .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#114:1>
<h> <bold> VI. Conclusion </bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-007#115:1>

<p> From above mentioned , although Durkheim  ' s idea cannot apply to modern
societies completely , he still has great contribution in sociology
undoubtedly . </p>
