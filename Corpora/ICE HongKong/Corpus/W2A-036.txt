Abstract .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#5:1>
A new type of switching-mode power supply , which contains no devices
, is described .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#6:1>
By avoiding inductors or transformers , the power supply presents high
power density , small size and low weight .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#7:1>
The controlled energy conversion is realized by using
switched-capacitors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#8:1>
The switching frequency is fixed and the driving signals of the
externally-controlled switchers are dictated by the feedback circuit of PWM
type. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#9:1>
<h> 1 . Introduction </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#10:1>
At present , most of the available DC-to-DC converters have small
power density due to the presence of inductors and transformers in their
basic structure .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#11:1>
Increasing the switching frequency solved only partially the problem .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#12:1>
In order to realize DC power supplies of small size and low
weight , magnetic elements have been replaced by controllable
switched-capacitor &obrack;  SC &cbrack; circuits <sp> 1-3 </sp> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#13:1>
The early SC-based DC-to-DC converters had limited capacity of
producing a constant output voltage for large changes in the load or even
small changes in the input voltage .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#14:1>
Here , the operation of another SC-based DC-to-DC step-up converter &obrack; 
6V/9V &cbrack; is described . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#15:1>
<h> 2 . Converter Structure </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#16:1>
The new converter &obrack;  Fig.1 &cbrack; contains two switched-capacitor
circuits , each one formed by a capacitor &obrack;  C <sb> 1 </sb> or C <sb> 2 </sb>
, both of the same value C &cbrack; and two externally controlled switches &obrack;  S <sb> 1
</sb> , S, <sb> 3 </sb> and S <sb> 2 </sb> , S <sb> 4 </sb> respectively &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#17:1>
They are operated in anti-symmetry , interchanging from a charging
process to a discharging one in each half-cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#18:1>
Consequently , in each half cycle , one of the two capacitors
provides the energy to the load .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#19:1>
The output voltage is given by the sum between the input voltage and
the voltage across the capacitor connected to the load .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#20:1>
For ensuring a very small ripple in the output voltage , an
additional capacitor , C <sb> 0 </sb> , is permanently connected in parallel
to the load . </p> <O> A figure </O>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#21:1>
<h> 3 . Converter Operator </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#22:1>
The behavior of the externally controlled switches is dictated by
the driving signals shown in Fig.2 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#23:1>
Accordingly , in each half-cycle , one switch is in  ' ON ' position ,
and another one changes from the  ' ON ' position to the  ' OFF ' position ,
determining two switching stages per half-cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#24:1>
The time in which the main switch conducts &obrack;  S <sb> 1 </sb> for the
first half-cycle and S <sb> 2 </sb> for the second half-cycle &cbrack; is denoted by
T <sb> on </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#25:1>
The feedback circuit , of PWM type , operates in such a way , as to
adjust by T <sb> on </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#26:1>
Consequently , the output voltage is kept constant despite variations
in the input voltage or load by changing the duration of the charging phase
in each half-cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#27:1>
The switching frequency , f <sb> s </sb> , and as a consequence the
switching period , T <sb> s </sb> &obrack;  T <sb> s </sb> =1/f <sb> s </sb>  &cbrack; is
kept constant . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#28:1>
According to the driving diagram , the power stage goes through
four switching topologies in each cycle &obrack;  Fig.3 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#29:1>
In the first one , capacitor C <sb> 1 </sb> is charged until the
value V <sb> Cmax </sb> , and capacitor C <sb> 2 </sb> begins its discharge
on the load from its initial value V <sb> Cmax <sb> &obrack;  Fig . 4 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#30:1>
This value has been reached at the end of the third state in the
previous cycle .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#31:1>
During the second cyclical state , C <sb> 1 </sb> is disconnected and
C <sb> 2 </sb> continues its discharging .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#32:1>
At the end of the state <space> , the voltage across C <sb> 2 </sb>
reaches the values V <sb> Cmin </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#33:1>
The output voltage , V <sb> L </sb> is given by the sum between the
source voltage , V <sb> 1 </sb> , and the voltage across the discharging
capacitor C <sb> 2 </sb> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#34:1>
In the second half-cycle the process is repeated , with C <sb> 1
</sb> and C <sb> 2 </sb> interchanging their roles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#35:1>
The design of the capacitor values , C <sb> 1 </sb> and C <sb> 2
</sb> , and of the half-cycle duration &obrack;  T <sb> s </sb> / 2 &cbrack; is accomplished
in such a way as to keep the difference between V <sb> Cmax </sb> and V <sb>
Cmin </sb> at a small value , thus ensuring high efficiency and small output
ripple .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#36:1>
The ripple in the output voltage is further smoothed by capacitor C
<sb> 0 </sb> . V <sb> Cmax </sb> is a bit smaller than V <sb> 1 </sb> <+> .
</+>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#37:1>
&obrack;  Each charging circuit , either in state 1 or state 3 , is formed by
the line voltage , a diode , a switch and the charging capacitor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#38:1>
V <sb> Cmax </sb> cannot reach V <sb> 1 </sb> due to the voltage <O>
A figure </O> drops on the parasitic resistance of the switch , capacitor and
the forward voltage on the diode in conduction , V <sb> D </sb>  &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#39:1>
By designing the converter in such a way that V <sb> Cmin </sb> has a
close value to V <sb> Cmax </sb> , the average input current in the charging
circuit is kept minimum , ensuring high efficiency .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#40:1>
Its peak is proportional to &obrack;  V <sb> 1 </sb> -V <sb> Cmin </sb>  &cbrack; .
</p> <O> 2 figures </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#41:1>
The externally controlled switches are driven by DS0026 chips ,
which ensure a reduced delay time at the switches turn on/off , diminishing
the switching losses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#42:1>
No transformations are used in the feedback circuit , to keep with
the goal of a magnetic-free regulator . </p>

<h> <bold> Quality assurance and testing in the construction industry
</bold> </h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#44:2>
By Ir C K Cheung

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#45:2>
The ISO 9000 quality management system &obrack;  QMS &cbrack; is widely adopted
by the local construction industry as a means of assuring the quality of its
activities , services and products .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#46:2>
In its Technical Circular &obrack;  WBTC &cbrack; 13/2001 , the Works Bureau &obrack;  WB)
stipulates the policy requirements for certain groups of contactors and
consultants who are engaged in public works to be certified to the relevant
ISO models .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#47:2>
The role of the Hong Kong Accreditation Service &obrack;  HKAS &cbrack; is to confer
recognition on certification bodies &obrack;  CB &cbrack; that are able to demonstrate
compliance with necessary requirements; in particular , the ISO Guide 62
<quote> " General requirements for bodies operating assessment and
certification of quality systems" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#48:2>
The Hong Kong Certification Body Accreditation Scheme &obrack;  HKCAS)
was launched by HKAS in 1998 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#49:2>
The accreditation offered covers a wide spectrum of activities in the
industrial and commercial sectors , among which construction is one of the
biggest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#50:2>
Currently there are about 1,600 organisations certified by the CB ,
of which 500 are construction or related organizations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#51:2>
There is strong criticism by stakeholders and the public that ISO
9000 places too much attention on paperwork but little emphasis on the
technical aspects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#52:2>
In an effort to address this concern , the year 2000 version of ISO
9000 focuses primarily on a process-oriented management system with just
sufficient paperwork to meet the operation of an organization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#53:2>
This new ISO also provides the benchmark for total quality management .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#54:2>
Auditing has to be performed by competent auditors who possess
sufficient technical knowledge and who know the essence of the process to be
audited .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#55:2>
Auditing as viewed by stakeholders is a value-added activity and not
just a pure compliance checking exercise . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#56:2>
To meet the expectation of stakeholders and the community at
large , HKAS will continue its endeavour to ensure that certification audits
are performed to fufil the mission of ISO 9001: 2000. </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#57:2>
<h> <bold> Quality testing of construction materials </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#58:2>
Unlike the ISO 9000 series , which ensured the implementation of
a QMS in an organisation , ISO/IEC 17025 focuses on the technical competence
of laboratories and their ability to produce reliable and accurate test
results .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#59:2>
It also provides the basic criteria for accreditation of
organisations performing testing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#60:2>
The Hong Kong Laboratory Accreditation Scheme &obrack;  HOKLAS &cbrack; was
established in 1985 with the objective of giving formal recognition to
competent laboratories who are able to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 .
HOKLAS-endorsed test reports have been widely accepted by the industry ,
signifying confidence in the accuracy and reliability of test results issued
by accredited laboratories . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#61:2>
Currently , there are about 35 local accredited construction
materials testing laboratories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#62:2>
The turnover of the construction testing industry amounts to about
HK&dollar;1 billion per annum .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#63:2>
The number of employees is estimated to be about 1,200 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#64:2>
<h> <bold> Scope of testing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#65:2>
The scope of HOKLAS  ' s accreditation of construction materials
testing is wide-ranging and expanding to meet the needs of the industry .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#66:2>
The following are the major categories . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#67:2>
<h> <bold> 1 . Concrete and its constituent materials </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#68:2>
WBTC 14/91 and Buildings <w> Department's </w> Practice Note for
Authorised Persons &obrack;  PNAP &cbrack; 145 requires testing of concrete cubes and cores
to the Hong Kong Construction Standard CS1:1990 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#69:2>
PNAP 251 further requires such testing to be carried out by
accredited laboratories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#70:2>
At peak period , a big laboratory may carry out tests of up to about
800 cubes per day .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#71:2>
To meet the huge demand , there are about 20 concrete laboratories
accredited . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#72:2>
Traditionally , site control tests and sampling , such as slump
and compacting factor tests to CS1; flow of fresh concrete to BS 1881: Part
105; and making of concrete cubes to CS1 , etc , were performed by the
contractor  ' s site staff .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#73:2>
However , it has been realised that this may give rise to potential
conflict of interest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#74:2>
The Housing Department &obrack;  HD &cbrack; required all site testing to be
performed by an independent accredited laboratory . </p> <O> A photo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#75:2>
To produce high quality concrete , it is necessary to have good
quality constituent materials such as cement , pulverised fuel ash &obrack;  PFA &cbrack; and
aggregates .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#76:2>
About 10 concrete laboratories also have accreditation for these
tests . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#77:2>
<h> <bold> 2 . Steel </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#78:2>
Steel is the second largest testing item after concrete and there
are 14 laboratories accredited for steel testing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#79:2>
Routine tests are often in the form of reinforcement bars for tensile
, bend and rebend test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#80:2>
WBTC 24/95 and PNAP 122 stipulate requirements for rebars testing to
CS2: 1995 and PNAP 251 further reinforced such requirements .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#81:2>
Owing to its low weight and high strength , structural steel in the
form of H piles is nowadays very often used .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#82:2>
It has to meet technical specifications detailed in BS 4360 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#83:2>
<h> <bold> 3 . Bituminous materials </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#84:2>
Accredited tests on bituminous materials include the
determination of binder content , theoretical specific gravity , bulk
specific gravity and determination of voids .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#85:2>
There are eight laboratories accredited , of which four are asphalt
<w> suppliers ' </w> own quality control laboratories , one is a government
laboratory and three are commercial laboratories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#86:2>
Tests are carried out in accordance with ASTM D2171 , D2041 , D2276
and D3203 . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#87:2>
<h> <bold> 4 . Building components </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#88:2>
Certain types of building components are required to be tested
for their safety and serviceability .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#89:2>
Accredited tests include pipe tests for strength and leakage; brick
and block tests for strength; door tests for resistance to impact and
jarring; cooking bench and sink unit tests for strength and localised
heating; pullout tests of tiles and anchor bolts and bending tests of facing
stones , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#90:2>
These tests are mainly required by HD for public housing projects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#91:2>
There are four laboratories accredited to carry out these tests in
accordance with HD requirements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#92:2>
Curtain walls for wind resistance tests to PNAP 106 are required
in accordance with PNAP 251 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#93:2>
Four laboratories are accredited to perform this test .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#94:2>
Recently , one laboratory is accredited to perform fire resistance
tests on doors , partition walls and non-load bearing elements to BS 476:
Part 20 and 22 . PNAP 251 stipulates mandatory requirements for testing by
accredited laboratories .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#95:2>
HOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No17 provides details of the technical
requirements for building components testing . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#96:2>
<h> 5 . <bold> Non-destructive tests &obrack;  NDT &cbrack; of welds </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#97:2>
NDT is diagnostic in nature and is used to detect any possible
weld defects .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#98:2>
Common tests are ultrasonic to BS 3923 &ampersand; BS EN 1714; radiographic to
BS 2600 , BS 2910 and BS EN 1435; magnetic to BS 6072 and BS EN 1290; and
penetrant to BS 6443 and BS EN 571-1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#99:2>
In line with international practices for NDT , personnel requirements
are stipulated .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#100:2>
Approved HOKLAS signatories have to be certified to Level 3 of the
American Society for Nondestructive Testing &obrack;  ASNT &cbrack; or the Personnel
Certification of Nondestructive tests &obrack;  PCN &cbrack; of the UK .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#101:2>
Similarly , approved HOKLAS operators have to be certified to Level
2 of the ASNT or PCN .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#102:2>
There are seven laboratories accredited for NDT of welds .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#103:2>
HOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No15 gives the technical requirements .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#104:2>
<h> <bold> 6 . Soil and rock </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#105:2>
The GEO Report No 36 for Phase I soil tests has been replaced by
the newly published Geospec 3,which encompasses both Phase I soil
classification and compaction tests as well as Phase II soil compressibility
and strength tests . WBTC 6/94 and PNAP 167 will be amended accordingly .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#106:2>
There are 13 laboratories accredited for Phase I soil tests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#107:2>
Accreditation for Phase II soil tests according to Geospec 3 is now
underway .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#108:2>
Rock testing mainly follows ASTM D2216 , D5731 , D2938 and D5687 on
classification , shear strength of rock joints , point load and uniaxial
compression tests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#109:2>
A HOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No19 is issued delineating the
technical requirements . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#110:2>
<h> <bold> 7 . Foundation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#111:2>
The short pile scandal sparked widespread public concern over
the issue of inadequate quality control on foundation works .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#112:2>
As advocated by the Construction Industry Review Committee , the
deployment of independent laboratories to perform foundation compliance tests
will undoubtedly help strengthen the confidence of the public in the
integrity of foundation works .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#113:2>
WBTC 22/2000 spells out the requirements for integrity tests for
pile foundation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#114:2>
Accredited tests include sonic logging , pile integrity , pile
dynamic , echo sounder , plate load and static load tests , etc .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#115:2>
There are eight laboratories accredited for these tests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#116:2>
HOKLAS Supplementary Criteria No16 details the technical
requirements . </p>

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#117:2>
<h> <bold> New scheme for construction products inspection &obrack;  HKIAS)
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#118:2>
In an attempt to provide further assurance for the procurement
of construction products , HKAS will launch a new scheme under the Hong Kong
Inspection Body Accreditation Scheme &obrack;  HKIAS &cbrack; , to accredit inspection bodies
for construction products , in early 2002 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#119:2>
This new scheme will focus on the technical inspection of procured
products against client  ' s specifications during manufacturing and/or
pre-shipping by competent HKIAS-approved technical inspectors .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#120:2>
Accreditation of inspection bodies will be in accordance with ISO
17020 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-036#121:2>
The world is now entering an era of rapid transformation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#122:2>
Given China  ' s accession to the World Trade Organisation and the
opportunity resulting from globalisation , multilaterally recognized
accreditation services will make a significant contribution to Hong Kong  ' s
ability to keep up with its trading partners .

<ICE-HK:W2A-036#123:2>
In this connection , HKAS has a significant role to play , by
maintaining a credible and efficient accreditation service to enhance the
quality of our building products and to strengthen our competitiveness in the
global market . </p>
