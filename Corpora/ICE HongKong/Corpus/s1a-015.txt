<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#1:1:A>
Maybe I can present my part first

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X2:1:Z>
You start first </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#3:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X4:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#5:1:A>
Okay sure

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#6:1:A>
Uhm <,> it is a book written by <,> Woodsworth and and <,> and <,> I
just read the chapter <{> <[> <,> </[> uh about motives here

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X7:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X8:1:Z>
This one </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#9:1:A>
Yeah <,> but I haven't finished because <,> I think there is
other chapters which is relevant as well <{> <[> <,> </[> </{> but <,> I
don't have the time to read it yet

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X10:1:Z>
<[> Uh huh </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X11:1:Z>
Oh he wrote it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X12:1:Z>
He wrote </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#13:1:A>
Yes yes so it and it  ' s quite easy to read too <{1> <[1> <,>
</[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#14:1:A>
The English is <,> <.> e s </.> is more <,> simple than I think
<{2> <[2> because </[2> you know the book is <,> like look <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> so old and I

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#15:1:A>
Originally I think the <unc> one-word </unc> English <.>
mus </.> must be very complicated and old too but <,> it  ' s not the <,> it  ' s
not <,> the case

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X16:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X17:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X18:1:Z>
<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X19:1:Z>
Okay </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#20:1:A>
You know first of all uhm uh <,> to Woodsworth <,> motive is a
power for actions and there is <,> <?> end </?> uhm <,> and it is
pre-existing

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#21:1:A>
That means uhm uh <,> it is present in the individuals he think
<{1> <[1> <,> </[1> so <,> I think it  ' s <,> it  ' s kind of

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#22:1:A>
He treat it as kind of like uhm <,> entity which possess by the <,>
individuals <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#23:1:A>
And he under understand behavior in terms of SOR

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#24:1:A>
And O is the uhm characteristic of the individual so there

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#25:1:A>
He did have <,> some uhm <,> his stipulate <,> stipulation about uh
in <,> internal mental state

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#26:1:A>
And later uh when when we uh go <{3> <[3> over </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X27:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X28:1:Z>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X29:1:Z>
<[3> Wait </[3> </{3> wait

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X30:1:Z>
Motivation you mean </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#31:1:A>
No no no

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#32:1:A>
It  ' s the <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> permanent characteristics of the
individual of individuals <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and motive is only one of them

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X33:1:Z>
<[1> No </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X34:1:Z>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X35:1:Z>
Right right right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#36:1:A>
You know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#37:1:A>
Uh <&> clears throat </&> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#38:1:A>
And the

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#39:1:A>
To him there there are two kinds of motives <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> the
<,> instinctual motives and the learned motives

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#40:1:A>
And he think that uhm this is intertwined together in a sense that
uh <,> natural motives can be modified uh through learnings

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#41:1:A>
For example and it is in four ways

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#42:1:A>
Uh the first is uhm <,> these motives can be can become more
specific through learning uh and this can <.> com </.> combine into more
complex motives <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#43:1:A>
And <,> the <?> third </?> the the first one means that uhm <,> for
example sex instinct is <,> inborn and instinctual right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#44:1:A>
But uh it can modify and become more <?> specific </?> specific in
a sense that for example some people like uh transvestites and some like
homosexuality so it become more <.> speci </.> uh specific in the <,> in the
more general instinctual sex instinct

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#45:1:A>
So it it  ' s kind of <,> modify uh through learning <{3> <[3> <,>
</[3> or maybe associations

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#46:1:A>
Uh he did mentions Pavlov  ' s <{4> <[4> association <,> </[4> and
also the little Albert

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#47:1:A>
Do you remember

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X48:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X49:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X50:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X51:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X52:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#53:1:A>
And the second he says motives are combine into more complex
motives in a sense that <,> uhm <,> for example uh <,> we do certain <,> we
do certain things

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#54:1:A>
Our motive drives us to do certain things <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> but
uh the action itself maybe satisfied <,> uh <,> at same time different
motives so it is it is combined already

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#55:1:A>
For example during uh eating it is uh satisfying the <,> hunger as
well as the <.> s </.> socialising <,> uh motives <{2> <[2> <,> of </[2>
human being

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#56:1:A>
Uhm the the third uhm <,> modification can be <,> done through <,>
uh <,> in the sense that <,> there are intermediate goals <,> and <,> and it
is <,> relative and <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#57:1:A>
It  ' s it  ' s like uh <,> we have some means to do an end

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#58:1:A>
For example we want to satisfy our uh pleasure needs so we earn
money right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#59:1:A>
But uh as time goes uhm <,> uh <,> at the <?> steps </?> uh of
earning money goes we may lost our original <,> goals and this means become
<,> the motive itself <{3> <[3> <,> </[3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#60:1:A>
And that means for example in the case of earning money uh the
money itself becomes originally it is money itself doesn't have any intrinsic
<,> satisfying <,> value right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#61:1:A>
But as time goes it becomes uh satisfying as in <,> in itself

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X62:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X63:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X64:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X65:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#66:1:A>
And the fourth <,> characteristics is <,> uh the new stimuli
become associated with the motive and capable of arousing it to activity like
uhm we <,> we have the instinctual motive to escape from danger right <{1>
<[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#67:1:A>
For example the uhm <,> fire is dangerous to our to to us so we
escape from it from it but uhm <,> it can be paired like the Pavlov <,>
thinks

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#68:1:A>
For example we heard the alarm uh the fire drill

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#69:1:A>
In the fire drill we heard the alarm <{2> <[2> <,> and </[2> then
we will go <,> for <,> the alarm itself <{3> <[3> without </[3> seeing a fire
or things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#70:1:A>
</{> Uhm <,,> and he and basically he has classified uh <,> motives
into different categories and it  ' s <,> just some categorization without <,>
a lot of significance I think <&>

$Z laughs follows by that of

$A </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#71:1:A>
Uh and and and he did mention that uhm <,> motives is for survival

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#72:1:A>
So I think it  ' s I think I think if it is <,> compatible with <,>
William James  '  adaption theory because <,> uhm <,,> because James did talk
about adaptation right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X73:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X74:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X75:1:Z>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X76:1:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#77:1:A>
So I don't know what <,> if it is the <.> com </.> it is <,>
comparable <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> or not

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#78:1:A>
And also he he did talk about the strength <,> of uh motivation and
I think it  ' s like educational psychology

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#79:1:A>
What is <,> said in educational psychology that <,> uhm <,> there
are different strength uh <,> uhm our motivation to do certain things is a
result of competition <,> right between different things

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#80:1:A>
For example uh <,> uh we we go to learn but at the same time <,> we
have the motivation to work but at the same at the same time <,> uh we  ' ve we
may have the motivation to play as well but uh finally we <,> do certain
thing because the strength is different <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#81:1:A>
And

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X82:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X83:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X84:1:Z>
Intensity </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#85:1:A>
Yes you can say that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#86:1:A>
And also he he did mention about purpose <{1> <[1> because </[1>
</{> uh motive is <,> an

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#87:1:A>
Although he  ' s not a <?> purposive </?> psychology like Tollman but
uh <{2> <[2> <,> he did mention about <,> </[2> he mention about uhm <,> the
motives in satisfying <,> certain things

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#88:1:A>
And actually the strength <,> itself it reflects the <,> effort or
commitment about our <,> towards certain action which is our purpose or our
goal <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> so our action is uh goal directed <{4> <[4> <,>
</[4> as well

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X89:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X90:1:Z>
<[2> <&> laughs </&> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X91:1:Z>
<[3> Uh huh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X92:1:Z>
<[4> Uh huh </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X93:1:Z>
So so are we taking James  '  <.> w </.> will you know </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#94:1:A>
Yeah actually

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X95:1:Z>
And then <,> it isn't based on that isn't it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#96:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X97:1:Z>
That  ' s where we  ' re supposed to start off with right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#98:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X99:1:Z>
But he <,> cause he cause he went <unc> four words </unc>
uhm motivation is what Woodsworth is <,> <?> yeah </?> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#100:1:A>
In reference to James <,> but <,> but I don't know where <,>
James  '  motivations <,> you know

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X101:1:Z>
Uh where James talked about <{> <[> motivation </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#102:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> how <,> how does he talk about it <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#103:1:A>
When you read when <,> if we define <{> <[> motivation </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X104:1:Z>
<[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </{> volition </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#105:1:A>
<?> Where  ' s </?> <{> <[> volition

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#106:1:A>
I think it  ' s </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X107:1:Z>
<[> <unc> two-words </unc> </[> </{> will you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X108:1:Z>
That  ' s <,> that  ' s the will you know that you have

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X109:1:Z>
And then just just uhm prove this person Woodsworth I think you
put it just in terms of the <,> common language that we use now you know
motivation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#110:1:A>
You mean uh James  '  notion of will is equivalent <{> <[> to
</[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X111:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> motivation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#112:1:A>
<.> Mo </.> motivation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X113:1:Z>
Uh huh uh huh <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X114:1:Z>
Like a drive and the needs you know <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X115:1:Z>
I think he elaborated further and then <,> came up with the
theory of motivation <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X116:1:Z>
Driving will </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#117:1:A>
See see see

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X118:1:Z>
<O> reads-from-text </O> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X119:1:Z>
See that anticipatory cues is <,> can be like <,> uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#120:1:A>
The stimulus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X121:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X122:1:Z>
It acts as if <,> I don't know preparatory react reaction in
drive states <,,> and the <?> consummatory </?> reaction </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#123:1:A>
I think Woodsworth uh concept of preparatory reaction is like
uhm the motive is intrinsic <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> is present already before any
action so it  ' s <,> uhm <,> it  ' s <,> a preparatory <,> state <{2> <[2> and
</[2> you react when there is some stimulus act upon it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X124:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X125:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X126:1:Z>
It doesn't have to be internal <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X127:1:Z>
Like here <,> I mean that  ' s what I read </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#128:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X129:1:Z>
<unc> one-word </unc> reaction such as stalking a prey

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X130:1:Z>
So you  ' re ready to bark pounce onto the <,> whatever the prey
and then in the end the end result is you eat it up </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#131:1:A>
You mean the <.> mo </.> the <.> mo </.> the motor action
itself is a stimulus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X132:1:Z>
Yeah <{> <[> it <unc> four words </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#133:1:A>
<[> It  ' s not the internal <,> </[> </{> things

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X134:1:Z>
That  ' s the reaction <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X135:1:Z>
But I don't  '  know if he only meant <,> external things but uh he
can mean internal but he  ' s talking about internal things as well <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X136:1:Z>
For the example he gives was you know it can be external as well

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X137:1:Z>
Well you can see </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#138:1:A>
Because when I read how the preparatory uh reaction on the
motives actually uhm <,> I was thinking about James react reactive <.> re
</.> reflex arc <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> because uhm <,> remember when a child saw
the fire he <,> had

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#139:1:A>
Initially <,> you can say that the withdrawal of his arm is
because the heat of the fire and differ that the fact uh <,> it burns <{2>
<[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#140:1:A>
But <,> initially he touch he go and touch it because <,> it  ' s he  ' s
out of curiosity

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X141:1:Z>
<[1> Uh huh uh huh </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X142:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X143:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#144:1:A>
So can we say that <,> the curiosity is the motive <,> for
his actions

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X145:1:Z>
Yeah <,> yeah <,> it is <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X146:1:Z>
Yeah <,> it is

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X147:1:Z>
That  ' s what made him go there in the first place but does James
talk about it like that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#148:1:A>
Yes I <,> I remember Dr Blowers <,> <{> <[> says about it <,>
</[> but I  ' m not sure whether James says about it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X149:1:Z>
<[> <&> laugh </&> okay </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X150:1:Z>
Oh yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X151:1:Z>
Hey you know in class yesterday uh he handed out this piece of
paper </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#152:1:A>
For everyone

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X153:1:Z>
Yeah for second year <unc> four words </unc>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X154:1:Z>
It  ' s about all the courses listed and then which courses would
you like to see <.> nex </.> offered next year </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#155:1:A>
Huh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X156:1:Z>
And then </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#157:1:A>
He  ' s the course coordinator

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X158:1:Z>
I don't  '  know

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X159:1:Z>
He  ' s just doing a survey he  ' s just doing survey </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#160:1:A>
Uh huh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X161:1:Z>
And then it  ' s got uhm <,> the compulsory courses right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#162:1:A>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X163:1:Z>
And then the </X>

<$A>

B right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X166:1:Z>

Well there are seven or eight and then <,> actually you don't
have to do what compulsory is and what the non-compulsory </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#168:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X169:1:Z>
You just choose any eight you want as a <unc> two-words
</unc> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X170:1:Z>
And then and then uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#171:1:A>
History and Issues no one <,> no one will choose it I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X172:1:Z>
Oh I don't know but you know the <,> the the the what

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X173:1:Z>
Elective courses yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#174:1:A>
Yes

Quite interesting courses </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#176:1:A>
What they have offered

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X177:1:Z>
Uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#178:1:A>
What they have offered

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X179:1:Z>
Uhm <,> uhm what was it like actually it  ' s not the ones that I  ' ve

aging and <{> <[> <,,> </[> whatever is Psychology </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#181:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#182:1:A>
Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#183:1:A>
Because they have split uh <{1> <[1> the life span </[1> into
different courses right <{> <[> <,> </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#184:1:A>
It <,> but it  ' s <,> the list of every courses

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X185:1:Z>
<[1> <unc> one-word </unc> Psychology </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X186:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah yeah yeah yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X187:1:Z>
Yeah that the uhm department can offer you know

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X188:1:Z>
And then <,> they want to see the frequency of the highest number
<unc> four words </unc> people choose </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#189:1:A>
Is there any new courses which is different from ours

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X190:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#191:1:A>
Because Cross Cultural I already get it <{> <[> <,> <unc>
three words </unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X192:1:Z>
<[> Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X193:1:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X194:1:Z>
Engineering Psychology but I don't think anyone would choose it
<&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X195:1:Z>
Engineering Psychology uh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#196:1:A>
I think it  ' s <,> uh <,> I like industrial

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X197:1:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#198:1:A>
Industrial Psychology because <,> in Industrial Psychology we
have uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#199:1:A>
Dr Hui is teaching it right

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X200:1:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#201:1:A>
But to uh towards the end <?> of </?> the semester <,> he has
given some lectures to Dr Chau and he talks about Engineering Psychology

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X202:1:Z>
Uh Dr Chau

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X203:1:Z>
Right right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X204:1:Z>
<unc> two words </unc> that  ' s what <,> I was thinking

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X205:1:Z>
It was Dr Chau  ' s <,> course but they didn't say which who was
the teacher </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#206:1:A>
Because it  ' s about how to <,> you

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#207:1:A>
How to design the <,> machines <{> <[> <,> </[> which fits to into
humans  '  kind of <,> uh mental work and then

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X208:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X209:1:Z>
AI </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#210:1:A>
Uh <,> no not AI

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#211:1:A>
AI is <,> about how to <,> make the machines <,> functions like a
<,> a human being right

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#212:1:A>
But it  ' s <,> like you know like a displace

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#213:1:A>
How is more <,> I mean <,> it  ' s more compatible for human to use
the machines <{1> <[1> how to </[1> design <{2> <[2> <,> </[2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#214:1:A>
Design of the machines <{3> <[3> <,> </[3> which <,> fits into our
<,> uhm <,,> you know <,> <.> con </.> concept or perceptions or things like
that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#215:1:A>
For example you <.> u </.> you use different colours for <,>
different kind of control <{4> <[4> <,> </[4> in <.> pan </.> in panel
control things like that

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#216:1:A>
It  ' s <,> kind of <,> technical and

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X217:1:Z>
<[1> Alright </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X218:1:Z>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X219:1:Z>
<[3> Uh huh </[3> </{3>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X220:1:Z>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X221:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#222:1:A>
Boring <{1> <[1> I think </[1> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#223:1:A>
So when I when I <,> read about it <{2> <[2> <,> uh </[2> do you
think there is anything compatible with what you  ' ve read

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X224:1:Z>
<[1> It  ' s true </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X225:1:Z>
<[2> Sorry </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X226:1:Z>
Oh what <,> uhm what you  ' ve done right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#227:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X228:1:Z>
This one SOR <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X229:1:Z>
Yes I agree <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X230:1:Z>
I agree <,> but <,,> and this because if even if it  ' s just
motive he talk of motives in relation to behavior and motive in relation to
perception you know <{> <[> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X231:1:Z>
It  ' s so broad </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#232:1:A>
<[> You know it because </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#233:1:A>
Yeah because he has <,> uh also talked about that motive cannot be
observed but <{1> <[1> it can </[1> be <,> it can only be only be inferred by
the <{2> <[2> behaviour </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X234:1:Z>
<[> Uhm yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X235:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> yeah yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X236:1:Z>
So what what aspects are we going to cover <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X237:1:Z>
Are we just gonna <unc> one word </unc> and look at
motivation <,> in terms of behaviour like S S and R </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#238:1:A>
Actually we can extend it because <,> Julie says we don't
have to

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X239:1:Z>
Stick to it

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X240:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uh yeah </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#241:1:A>
<[> Stick to it </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X242:1:Z>
But I  ' m just wondering it  ' s it  ' s very broad so which which <,>
which one are we going to <,> talk about </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#243:1:A>
What are the choices we have

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X244:1:Z>
What are the choices <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X245:1:Z>
Behaviour is a good choice <,> don't you think <&> both-laugh
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X246:1:Z>
No isn't it easiest to talk about behavior you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X247:1:Z>
Because <,> you talk <,> you can bring in Pavlov you know <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X248:1:Z>
Who else <,,> <unc> five words </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#249:1:A>
The only I can think of <,> uhm <,> their common point is to
talk about <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#250:1:A>
I think he  ' s uh more or less a functionalist as well because he
<,> talks about process instead of uh content

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X251:1:Z>
Uh huh <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X252:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#253:1:A>
So in <,> in what have you read uh what do you think is <,>
the main point about <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#254:1:A>
Your book is <.> wro </.> wrote by who

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#255:1:A>
James

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X256:1:Z>
This is James <,> so I don't really read it <&> laughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X257:1:Z>
But I <,> this one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X258:1:Z>
I think there is one chapter on <,> motivation

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X259:1:Z>
If it  ' s not written by him it  ' s written by other people </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#260:1:A>
About him

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X261:1:Z>
Yeah about him <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X262:1:Z>
And there is one about <,> the first one yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X263:1:Z>
Perception and action the SOR <,> process <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X264:1:Z>
So that  ' s what I wrote that  ' s what I read </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#265:1:A>
And also he had talked about the sensation

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X266:1:Z>
Yes sensation <unc> one-word </unc> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#267:1:A>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X268:1:Z>
But does that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X269:1:Z>
How does that relate to James <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X270:1:Z>
We can we can we can talk about other <.> ah </.> <{> <[> area
</[> in <.> re </.> in relation to James </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#271:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#272:1:A>
And Woodsworth talks about uh sensations

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#273:1:A>
Uh it is sensation that motivate action right <{1> <[1> <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#274:1:A>
And </[1> James is also <,> uh talking about sensation because he
has the S and R <,> uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#275:1:A>
No no

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#276:1:A>
S and M <,> is uhm <&> laughs </&> the sensory <,> the reflex arc
the sensory and the motor <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> things <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#277:1:A>
So I think James is <,> I think James <,> uhm <,> did think that
uhm action <,> comes from sensory stimulus

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X278:1:Z>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X279:1:Z>
<[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X280:1:Z>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X281:1:Z>
You know <,> uhm <,> we don't we don't really have to make
comparisons do we </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#282:1:A>
We don't have to make comparison because <,> <{> <[>
<unc> two words </unc> because uhm </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X283:1:Z>
<[> Yeah we just </[> </{> making James as starting point of how
<,> uhm Woodsworth developed his ideas and how successful was he in
developing his ideas </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#284:1:A>
Really

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X285:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#286:1:A>
I was thinking <,> the uh essay question is about how how
Woodsworth is influenced by James

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X287:1:Z>
Yeah yeah yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X288:1:Z>
Uh huh

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X289:1:Z>
So in his work it  ' ll you know <,> it  ' ll talk about James  ' s
influence

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X290:1:Z>
You know we can figure out <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X291:1:Z>
So I guess that  ' s the part where we  ' re making a comparison but
then how successful was his you know was his idea was <{> <[> <unc>
one-word </unc> </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#292:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{> you think the main purpose is on <,> uh
James <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#293:1:A>
<{> <[> And </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X294:1:Z>
<[> Half </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X295:1:Z>
Cos the question divided in two parts of </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#296:1:A>
Actually do you have the question <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#297:1:A>
Because <{> <[> <,> </[> Julie <.> Ju </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#298:1:A>
Oh we  ' re in the same tutorial

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X299:1:Z>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X300:1:Z>
Yeah yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#301:1:A>
But Julie hasn't really give us uhm <,> very definite essay
<{> <[> question </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#302:1:A>
We just say it <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#303:1:A>
What do we need to put down in this in the essays

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X304:1:Z>
<[> Question </[> </{> yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X305:1:Z>
Uh that tutorial she <unc> one word </unc> a hole in my
file <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X306:1:Z>
TNN <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X307:1:Z>
Anticipatory image

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X308:1:Z>
We have <,> the anticipatory set before we actually get <,> the
movement </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#309:1:A>
He also talk about set <{> <[> <,> I think </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X310:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X311:1:Z>
So I think that  ' s <,> that  ' s fine </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#312:1:A>
Because it  ' s I think <,> it  ' s because motive is primarily
<,> uhm present

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X313:1:Z>
Uh huh </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#314:1:A>
A priori <,> of the action so it is a set in the <,> mind

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X315:1:Z>
Right right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#316:1:A>
An entity in itselves <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#317:1:A>
So it is as the same as James <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#318:1:A>
James also says that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X319:1:Z>
James said that

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X320:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X321:1:Z>
Oh this is Woodsworth yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#322:1:A>
Yeah this <{> <[> is Woodsworth </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X323:1:Z>
<[> Yeah yeah yeah </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#324:1:A>
In what is <,> in James  ' s language

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X325:1:Z>
Anticipatory Image <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X326:1:Z>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#327:1:A>
And he did <,> talk about learning as well I think James <{>
<[> in a </[> sense that <,> uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#328:1:A>
The first time you know the first time uhm <,> the child saw the
fire and <,> touch it and then withdraw but the next time when he saws it his
reaction will be different <,> because he has already got

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X329:1:Z>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X330:1:Z>
He just exhausts it <&> laughs </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#331:1:A>
Really <&> both laugh </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X332:1:Z>
<unc> five words </unc> machine here </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#333:1:A>
Uh <&> laughs </&> I forgot <,> what <,> to say

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X334:1:Z>
When he sees it </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#335:1:A>
Well the next time he sees it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X336:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#337:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X338:1:Z>
The fire right </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-015#339:1:A>
Yeah <{1> <[1> he won't </[1> he won't <,> reach <{2> <[2>
<,> reach out <,> </[2> because he has <,> the <,> will go through the whole
process of <,> the experience <{3> <[3> <,> the </[3> experience he had <{4>
<[4> <,> </[4>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#340:1:A>
And <,> so that so <{5> <[5> there  ' s </[5>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X341:1:Z>
<[1> Yeah yeah </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-015#X342:1:Z>
