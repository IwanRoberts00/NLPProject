Introduction </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#4:1>
Happiness has always been regarded as an important end of human
activities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#5:1>
Despite the lack of consensus on what happiness is and how it can be
achieved , the starting point of achieving individual happiness or well-being
should undoubtedly be the satisfaction of primary human needs .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#6:1>
For example , general concern about the individual  ' s quality of life
in developing countries &obrack; where food and shelter are critical matters
and very few basic human needs are satisfactorily met &cbrack; is normally
focused on the physical and quantitative aspects and guided by the dictum of
&ldquo; the more , the better . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#7:1>
Individual and societal wellbeing are measured primarily by a variety
of indicators of social conditions such as gross domestic product and its
composition , household income , percentage of housing units with piped water
and toilets inside , total and per capita consumption of electricity , life
expectancy , supply of physicians and trained health personnel , per capita
supply of calories and protein , illiteracy rate , etc . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#8:1>
This approach basically assumes that economic development can
bring about social development and enhance people  ' s quality of life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#9:1>
In other words , the quality of life becomes a function of the
objective conditions of society in which one lives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#10:1>
Yet the obvious discrepancies between economic growth and social
progress experienced in the West in the 1960s have not only shaken the a
priori assumption of the correlation between objective social conditions and
subjective quality of life , but also revealed the inadequacy of material
wellbeing as the principal determinant of personal happiness . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#11:1>
Unlike the developing countries , studies in the quality of life
in modern and affluent societies are characterized by their emphasis on
attitudinal measures .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#12:1>
The focus on measuring individual quality of life has shifted from
&ldquo; being well-off &rdquo; to &ldquo; a sense of wellbeing &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#13:1>
Social scientists and policy-markers begin to recognize that people  ' s
perceptions and evaluations of their life situations , however uninformed
they may be , are real to persons involved .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#14:1>
People act on the basis of their perceptions and they should also be
the best judges of their own wellbeing . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#15:1>
Over the past three decades , Hong Kong people have profited
significantly form the territory  ' s miraculous modernization , urbanization
and Westernization .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#16:1>
The breathtaking socioeconomic progress Hong Kong has undergone
reveals a similar development trend in the West .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#17:1>
Along with the impressive gain in affluence is a multitude of
emergent problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#18:1>
For example , while people are enjoying a longer life and
experiencing less infectious diseases , they suffer more from a variety of
noninfectious illnesses , especially those related to people  ' s
self-destructive lifestyles .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#19:1>
Family structure and values are changing , and many of the elderly
are psychologically and economically maladjusted .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#20:1>
The educational attainment of the population has been elevated to an
unprecedented level , yet people are decrying the deteriorating academic and
moral standards of the younger generation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#21:1>
People are better off , but also have to worry more about personal
safety and public order .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#22:1>
In spite of technological advancement , our environment is
deteriorating dangerously .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#23:1>
What is the impact of these worrisome developments on the quality of
life of Hong Kong people ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#24:1>
How do they perceive and evaluate these changes ?

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#25:1>
Objective statistics are indispensable for understanding people  ' s
wellbeing , and most of them can be obtained from the many reports published
by the government and other public organizations . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#26:1>
In this chapter , after a brief presentation of the territory  ' s
objective social conditions and some comparisons with other places , I shall
focus primarily on people  ' s own account of their personal wellbeing which
includes their major life concerns , the evaluation of the living environment
, personal life satisfaction and expectation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#27:1>
Subjective wellbeing contains two conceptual dimensions : &obrack; 1
&cbrack; the positive aspect &obrack; the extent to which one feels happy is
satisfied with his/her life &cbrack; &semi; and &obrack; 2 &cbrack; the
negative aspect &obrack; the extent to which one can avoid various miseries
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#28:1>
Variations among population groups on subjective wellbeing will be
analysed to gauge the distribution of sense of wellbeing in Hong Kong . </p>
<h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#29:1>
General Social Conditions </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#30:1>
Hong Kong has become one of the world  ' s high-income economies .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#31:1>
According to the World Bank , the majority of its socioeconomic
performance ratings rank among the world  ' s top quartile .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#32:1>
Its overall economic performance is ranked second only to Singapore
within the newly industrializing countries category by the World Economic
Forum and the International Centre for Management Development in 1991  ' s
World Competitiveness Report .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#33:1>
Indicators of the territory  ' s progress are legion .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#34:1>
For example , in accordance with the Engel  ' s Law , one of the most
obvious life improvement indicators is the structure of private consumption .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#35:1>
Compared to the past , the people of Hong Kong today spend less on
food , eat more outside , live more comfortably , enjoy more leisure
activities , travel overseas to spend a vacation , and demand more advanced
and luxurious consumer items .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#36:1>
Major aspects of the territory  ' s performance and their comparisons
with some selected countries are presented in Table 1 .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#37:1>
The majority of these indicators pertain either to the proportion of
the population having or not having a specific quality &obrack; e.g .
literacy &cbrack; , or to a standard of adequacy with regard to certain
living conditions &obrack; e.g . daily calorie supply &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#38:1>
Major Life Concerns </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#39:1>
As a concept , &ldquo; the quality of life &rdquo; is by nature
normative and presupposes subjective judgement .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#40:1>
The specification of the major life concerns , which embody
individual aspirations and societal goals , is thus generally regarded as a
step towards a workable , albeit partial , definition of the quality of life .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#41:1>
The range of possible human concerns from personal to social
matters , is extremely broad .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#42:1>
What is valuable in life may vary across cultures , over time , and
among peoples .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#43:1>
However , a study of life concerns in thirteen countries has
demonstrated the existence of an underlying , cross-cultural dimension: <X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#X44:1>
<quote> .. . the vast majority of people  ' s hopes and fears revolve
around the complex of personal well-being , and this is rather simply and
genuinely defined : a decent standard of living &semi; opportunity for
children &semi; technological advances &semi; good health &semi; a good job
&semi; decent housing &semi; a happy home life &semi; better educational
facilities... </quote> </X>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#45:1>
As shown in Table 2 , Hong Kong people have a relatively broad
consensus on the meaning of a happy life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#46:1>
They desire both nonmaterial satisfaction and material gratification .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#47:1>
Their conception of happiness is very personal and individualistic .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#48:1>
Good health , being the bedrock of everyday life activities , has
always been the most cherished value .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#49:1>
Money comes second .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#50:1>
Nevertheless , people are not quite explicit about their
materialistic orientation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#51:1>
Very few of them identify material enjoyment as the most important
ingredient of happiness .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#52:1>
The emphasis placed on certain Confucian values , such as filial
piety and peace of mind , may reflect the lingering influence of traditional
Chinese culture .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#53:1>
It is interesting to note that , despite the centrality of the family
in Chinese societies , the importance of love and marriage has always been
given a relatively low significance .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#54:1>
Findings in the past five years seem to indicate the declining
importance of health , love and marriage , and the growing significance of
money and peace of mind , as the most important sources of happiness <O>
table </O> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#55:1>
Although Hong Kong people are often praised for their <-> hardwork
</-> <+> hard work </+> , the importance of career and work in a happy life
is low .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#56:1>
People are willing to donate for charity causes , but social services
are definitely not regarded as important for personal wellbeing . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#57:1>
Evaluation of the Living Environment </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#58:1>
Perception of Social Problems </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#59:1>
The nature and magnitude of social problems have direct impact
upon people  ' s wellbeing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#60:1>
In previous social indicators surveys , respondents were asked to
evaluate the degree of seriousness of different categories of social problems
and to indicate the most serious social problem that should be solved
immediately .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#61:1>
The results of the 1990 survey are listed in Table 3 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#62:1>
The findings indicate a relatively high public consciousness of
social problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#63:1>
Five problems were rated by over half of the respondents as serious
or very serious .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#64:1>
Only three of them , viz. brain drain , social welfare , and
education , received noncommittal answers by over 10 per cent of the
respondents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#65:1>
Although Hong Kong has been described as a society of refugees
who are obsessed with economic gains , the continuous influx of Vietnamese
refugees is nevertheless received with unprecedented public resentment <O>
table </O> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#66:1>
In my survey , the perceived seriousness of the problem of Vietnamese
boat people rises to the top .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#67:1>
Not only nearly nine out of ten respondents considered it as a
serious social problem , it was also regarded by the Royal Hong Kong Police
Force as a great problem with which it has to cope . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#68:1>
In the past year , progress on the environmental front has been
made .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#69:1>
For instance , a low-surplus fuel policy for factories was announced
, laws governing water pollution were extended to two additional areas ,
bilateral agreements on environmental control were signed with Guangdong
province and the city of Shenzhen , unleaded fuel and more &ldquo;
environment-friendly &rdquo; products were introduced .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#70:1>
Despite these advances , the problem of environment pollution still
occupies second place on the list of perceived serious problems . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#71:1>
In view of the scheduled return of the territory to China , more
and more people try to ease their anxiety by emigration .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#72:1>
The incessant outflow of people and capital should not only threaten
the economy and increase the propensity to migrate among those staying behind
, but should also dampen the morale and confidence of those who do not want
or are not qualified to emigrate .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#73:1>
Therefore , it is not at all surprising to find the problem of
&ldquo; brain drain &rdquo; being rated quite high in perceived seriousness
by the respondents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#74:1>
The problems of the elderly and social morality were considered
by nearly half of the respondents as serious .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#75:1>
It is noteworthy that the problems with higher degree of perceived
seriousness are mostly those affecting particular population groups &obrack;
e.g . the Vietnamese , the youth and the elderly &cbrack; , those associated
with social order , and those comparatively less amenable to control or
prevention .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#76:1>
On the contrary , problems with a lower degree of perceived
seriousness are those public and social services &obrack; e.g . education ,
social welfare , medical services , transport , and housing &cbrack; for
whose provision the government is directly responsible .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#77:1>
Furthermore , the closer a problem is related to the people  ' s daily
livelihood and immediate personal interests , the easier its seriousness
would be perceived . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#78:1>
When asked to name the most serious social problem that should be
solved immediately , respondents also ranked the Vietnamese boat people first .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#79:1>
However , apart from this problem , there is apparently a lack of
congruence between the degree of perceived seriousness of a problem and the
urgency of its solution .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#80:1>
The best example is the problem of environmental pollution .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#81:1>
As a result of visible environmental deterioration , the active
involvement of environmental protection organizations , the increasing
attention given to it by the mass media , and growing government intervention
, people should now be very conscious of the environmental problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#82:1>
Yet , surprisingly , although ranked second in terms of perceived
seriousness , it was identified by merely 5.6 per cent of the respondents as
the social problem that should be solved immediately . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#83:1>
Public perceptions of social problems often change from time to
time .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#84:1>
The most common causes of these changes are shifts in values , the
solution of old problems , and the creation of new ones .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#85:1>
Comparisons of the 1986 , 1988 , and 1990 date reveal that the
problems of youth and public order are persistently seen by the majority of
respondents as serious social problems .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#86:1>
Still , some changes have taken place .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#87:1>
The problems of the Vietnamese boat people , environmental problems ,
and &ldquo; brain drain &rdquo; become &ldquo; new &rdquo; social problems
resulting from an increasing public awareness , and there is a slight decline
in the perceived seriousness of some &ldquo; old &rdquo; social problems
related to the provision of social and public services . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#88:1>
With respect to the perceived problems facing Hong Kong in the
coming five years , the ordering of their perceived seriousness is similar to
that found in the past year .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#89:1>
According to opinion polls conducted by City and New Territories
Administration &obrack; CNTA &cbrack; in March 1990 , &ldquo; Hong Kong  ' s
future &rdquo; still continues to top the list .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#90:1>
Following it are &ldquo; economy-related , &rdquo; &ldquo;
crime-related , &rdquo; &ldquo; labour-related &rdquo; and &ldquo;
housing-related &rdquo; problems . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#91:1>
Satisfaction with Living Conditions </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#92:1>
People show ambivalent attitudes towards the general situation .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#93:1>
On the one hand , public confidence in the territory  ' s future seems
to have improved gradually the June 4 in China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#94:1>
For example , the value and volume of retail sales in supermarkets
and department stores have gone up again .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#95:1>
The quarterly Survey Research Hongkong &obrack; SRH &cbrack;
Political Confidence Indexes in 1990 were 88,88,90 and 93 respectively .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#96:1>
Most people were of the opinion that Hong Kong was still the best
place in the world to live .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#97:1>
Yet , on the other hand , public worries about the deterioration of
the quality of life are growing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#98:1>
Faced with a double-digit inflation rate which is in fact the highest
in a decade and which outpaces the rate of salary increase , people  ' s
livelihood &obrack; especially among production and related workers &cbrack;
have undoubtedly been affected .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#99:1>
Many people say that their living standard is falling and that it
will get worse in the near future if the steep upward trend in the cost of
living is not reversed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#100:1>
Public anxiety about and resentment at the deterioration of the
quality of life have been vividly expressed in a number of unprecedented
anti-inflation mass protests .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#101:1>
The largest of these protests was coorganized by 176 citizens groups
in April 1990 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#102:1>
Furthermore , people are quite dissatisfied with a wide spectrum
of the territory  ' s general social conditions .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#103:1>
None of the social conditions asked about in the 1990 survey was
considered satisfactory by half of the respondents &obrack; see Table 4
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#104:1>
People were more concerned with matters that affected them directly
and personally &obrack; e.g . transport , public orders , housing etc.
&cbrack; than those macrolevel or &ldquo; remote &rdquo; issues &obrack; e.g .
political and economic situation and social welfare &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#105:1>
In the past year , a number of economic problems , such as sluggish
economic growth , the heavy public expenditure commitments &obrack;
especially the &dollar;16.3 billion airport plan &cbrack; and high inflation
, were commonly regarded as threatening people  ' s quality of life .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#106:1>
Nevertheless , people were still more satisfied with Hong Kong  ' s
economic conditions than with the conditions in the sociopolitical spheres .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#107:1>
Widespread mistrust of the Chinese government , anxieties about
the impending transfer of sovereignty , and unease at the increasing
involvement of China in local affairs together make the fast-changing
political situation the least satisfactory and most uncertain social
condition in the public mind .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#108:1>
Less than one-sixth of the respondents were satisfied with the
political situation while nearly a quarter of them gave only noncommittal
replies . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-015#109:1>
Public order has always been a major public concern in urban
society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#110:1>
In view of the rapid increase in serious crimes &obrack; e.g . armed
robbery was up 45 per cent in the first half-year of 1991 as compared to the
same period in 1990 &cbrack; , it is not at all surprising to find that
public order was seen by the respondents as the second most dissatisfying
social condition .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#111:1>
The enormous pressures generated by high population density make
problems of transport and housing major sources of public discontent .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#112:1>
Education continues to take up the largest share of the government  ' s
total expenditure , but only four out of ten of the respondents were
satisfied with it <O> table </O> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-015#113:1>
Finally , public satisfaction with recreation , employment ,
economic situation , education and medical services were all only slightly
above average . </p> </I>
