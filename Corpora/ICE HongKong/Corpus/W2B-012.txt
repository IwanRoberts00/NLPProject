<bold> Educational psychologist hits out at cash shortage </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#3:1>
Lack of funding for training and demanding job requirements have
led to a serious shortage of educational psychologists , according to a
veteran practitioner in the field . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#4:1>
In 1990 , the Education Commission projected that 86 educational
psychologists would be needed within the following eight years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#5:1>
However , Dr Lam Sui-fong , associate professor of the Department of
Psychology at the University of Hong Kong , said there were only about 50
working for schools and the Education Department . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#6:1>
In last year  ' s Policy Address , Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
announced that school-based educational psychologist services would be
introduced to 200 primary schools in the next six years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#7:1>
But Dr Lam , who also heads the two-year master  ' s programme on
educational psychology , criticised the Government for not providing enough
funds to meet that target . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#8:1>
Since 1981 , HKU has been the only local provider of training .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#9:1>
But at present , the programme has funding for just 10 students to
enrol every two years .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#10:1>
Dr Lam said she had approached both the Education Department and the
University Grants Committee for more resources , to no avail .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#11:1>
HKU will increase the number to 15 for next year by charging students
&dollar;50,000 in fees - &dollar;10,000 more than now .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#12:1>
&ldquo; But only 45 educational psychologists will emerge by the end
of 2008 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#13:1>
The number is too small for primary schools , not to mention the
secondary and special needs sectors , &rdquo; Dr Lam said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#14:1>
Ruth Lau Wing-mun , who oversees the team of educational
psychologists in the Education Department , said the manpower shortage could
be tackled by recruiting those with overseas qualifications .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#15:1>
&ldquo; If other local tertiary institutes find the need is expanding
, they can also open relevant programmes , &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#16:1>
However , tough employment requirements deter psychology
graduates from the field .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#17:1>
To be an educational psychologist , candidates must complete a first
degree in psychology , a master  ' s degree in educational psychology and at
least four years ' teaching experience .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#18:1>
But on graduating , they receive a starting salary of &dollar;25,000
a month , less than a teacher with equivalent work experience . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#19:1>
Promotion to higher grades requires a postgraduate certificate in
education and six years ' working experience in education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#20:1>
The requirements were considered &ldquo; very unreasonable
&rdquo; by the Hong Kong Psychological Society  ' s Sub-Committee on the
Employment Structure for Educational Psychologists , said Dr Lam , who headed
the group until last year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#21:1>
&ldquo; Teachers are unlikely to be prepared to quit their stable
jobs , pay for their studies and then receive a lower salary , &rdquo; she
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#22:1>
The sub-committee wants a review of the employment structure .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#23:1>
The Government has since relaxed the requirement for four years'
teaching experience for lower-grade educational psychologists , but only as
an interim measure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#24:1>
In the last reply to Dr Lam  ' s series of letters to the Education
Department last year , she was told that &ldquo; the review . . . is a
tedious exercise involving various policy bureaux and the Standing Commission
on Civil Service Salaries and Conditions of Service" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#25:1>
She has had no further response . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#26:1>
Tso Kai-lok , vice-chairman of the Education Convergence , said
that a review of the role of educational psychologists was needed .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#27:1>
Many schools were ignorant of how they could help students learn , he
said .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#28:1>
Some used them as social workers , resulting in a waste of resources .

<bold> Women less likely to be promoted: study ` Glass ceiling ' in
career development caused by pressure on female teachers to balance jobs and
family life </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#30:2>
<bold> Polly Hui <bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#31:2>
Education reforms are taking their toll on women teachers more
than men because of the pressures they face in juggling longer working hours
and family life , experts on education and gender studies claim . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#32:2>
Statistics compiled by the Education Department show that
although there are more women than men in the teaching profession , women are
still less likely to be promoted to higher levels . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#33:2>
The figures reveal that 63.5 per cent of secondary school
teachers on assistant master grade last year were women .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#34:2>
However , women on senior graduate master grade accounted for 41.4
per cent of the total .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#35:2>
Just 30 per cent of school principals were women . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#36:2>
In the primary sector , the percentages of female teachers on
assistant master and primary school master grades were 66.5 and 61.6 per cent
respectively last year .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#37:2>
But they become a minority at the principal level , holding 47.1 per
cent of headships .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#38:2>
The latter , though , is an improvement on figures from 1995 , when
just 25 per cent of primary principals were women . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#39:2>
Many teachers must now shoulder extra duties and work longer
hours as competition between schools for students and resources intensifies ,
some academics on educational administration assert .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#40:2>
In a society where females have greater responsibility for raising
their children , many women teachers find it hard to cope with their dual
roles . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#41:2>
Some educators attribute the glass ceiling in women teachers'
career development to school heads ' doubts about their female staff  ' s
commitment to their work .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#42:2>
Others said many women chose not to assume senior posts in order to
spend more time with their children . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#43:2>
Dr Anita Chan Kit-wa , a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre of
Asian Studies at the University of Hong Kong who has undertaken research on
gender and education , said that the education reforms had changed the work
culture in schools to one where women - particularly those who were married
with children - were not favoured . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#44:2>
Market principles had been introduced to the school sector and
allocation of resources were more performance-based than before , said Dr
Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#45:2>
&ldquo; Schools are more keen to deliver student-centred and
parent-centred services in order to stay competitive .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#46:2>
Many women teachers are under enormous pressure to achieve a balance
between their career and family life .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#47:2>
But their plight is rarely looked into by the Government , &rdquo;
she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#48:2>
The problem was particularly acute in new schools , said Dr Chan .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#49:2>
To boost their student intakes , some schools ask teachers to stay on
after school to provide child-care services .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#50:2>
Teacher performance charts , detailing class academic results , all
add to the pressure . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#51:2>
Dr Dora Choi Po-king , associate professor of educational
administration and policy at Chinese University of Hong Kong , said gender
distribution across teaching ranks was likely to increase as schools gained
more control of their management and budgets . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#52:2>
&ldquo; With the decentralisation of budgeting , senior teachers
will be expected to handle more administrative duties such as drafting
proposals for the Quality Education Fund .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#53:2>
Male teachers are generally more ambitious and they won't mind the
extra amount of paperwork as long as they can progress in their career .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#54:2>
But many women teachers would prefer to stay at a post where they can
focus on nurturing students , &rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#55:2>
Dr Ng Ho-ming , deputy director of the Centre of Educational
Leadership at HKU , said that some principals tended to promote male staff
because they believed the latter were more committed to their careers .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#56:2>
They were also worried that women teachers had to have maternity
leave and days off if their children were sick , he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#57:2>
However , Lisa Yip Sau-wah , principal of Shatin Tsung Tsin
Secondary School , said the trend reflected the traditional family role
played by Chinese women rather than sex discrimination .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#58:2>
Many married female teachers declined promotion because they wanted
to spend more time with their young children , she said . </p>

VIEWPOINT </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#63:3>
<bold> I </bold> N the film version of Umberto Eco  ' s novel <it>
The Name of the Rose </it> , Sean Connery plays a renaissance man trapped in
the Dark Ages .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#64:3>
A scholar-monk-detective who employs reason and wisdom against the
forces of paranoia , prejudice , superstition and fear in the search for
truth . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#65:3>
A look at Professor Chang Hsin-kang  ' s résumé gives the
impression of a modern renaissance man .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#66:3>
An engineer educated in Taiwan and the United States .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#67:3>
A globe-trotting academic immersed in the Chinese classic yet versed
in Western culture .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#68:3>
A scientist with a passion for the arts - eloquent in English and
Putonghua , functional in Cantonese .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#69:3>
On top of all that , he  ' s president of the City University , the
Cultural and Heritage Commission chairman , a PCCW director even . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#70:3>
When you see the man in person , he exucdes the air of a scholar
and a gentleman .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#71:3>
Until he faces the media scrum that is .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#72:3>
When confronted with eager journalists at the beginning of last week
, Mr Chang appeared bewildered , timid and reticent .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#73:3>
I witnessed both manifestations of the Chang persona last week at a
seminar on the Culture of World Cities . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#74:3>
Professor Chang appeared uncomfortable when reporters pressed him
on when exactly there  ' d be a decision on Li Shaomin .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#75:3>
However , once he took to the podium , he relaxed visibly .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#76:3>
If anyone was living proof that flashbulbs can render a person "
temporarily brain-dead" , he was it , he joked . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#77:3>
Thinking the congenial atmosphere inside the lecture theatre make
him more accessible , I approached Professor Chang during the tea-break .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#78:3>
I didn't want to grill him , but merely get some comment &obrack;  however
non-committal &cbrack; in English .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#79:3>
I stood right next to him and made my request in a political and
non-threatening way .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#80:3>
So , it came as a shock when he looked at me , then looked past me
and then just walked away .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#81:3>
This was not what I expected from the president of a university .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#82:3>
Perhaps he was still suffering from post-flashbulb stress disorder .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#83:3>
Eventually , I did manage to elicit a response during a
question-and-answer session after the speakers had finished their
presentations .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#84:3>
I had been particularly impressed with a presentation by Professor Yu
Qiuyu , the acclaimed mainland writer , who stressed the importance of
original thought and a vibrant intellectual life to the culture of a world
city . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#85:3>
What , I asked Professor Chang , was the importance of academic
freedom and academic courage in maintaining and encouraging intellectual life ?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#86:3>
It was good to hear his ringing endorsement of the importance of
academic freedom , freedom of expression and of investigation .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#87:3>
What was interesting though , was Professor Chang  ' s warning against
the abuse and politicisation of academic freedom . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#88:3>
At that moment he struck me as a renaissance man trapped in a
post-modern society .

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#89:3>
A society where public figures are asked to account for and
explain their reasoning and actions , where the political implications of
decisions in the public sphere are discussed and analysed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#90:3>
Gone are the days when the heads of academic institutions could
administer scholarly fiefdoms without regard to the world outside the ivory
towers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#91:3>
The fact is that in a modem , democratic society the machinations
of public institutions are bound to be scrutinised .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#92:3>
For better or worse , presidents of universities will fare better if
they have political and media savvy , and that doesn't just mean being able
to please the establishment .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#93:3>
Just think of what happened to the former vice-chancellor Cheng
Yiu-chung during the Robert Chung controversy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#94:3>
Professor Chang  ' s recommendation not to discipline Li Shaomin
was both sensible and wise .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#95:3>
His comments after announcing the decision were measured and
reasonable .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#96:3>
If he had been clearer about the principles on which the case would
be considered from the outset , both he and the university would have won far
greater respect . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#97:3>
A university should be at the cutting edge if free-thinking , a
centre for academic endeavour without fear or favour .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#98:3>
Above all , a university should be a home for those who seek truth
and dare to question accepted truths . </p>

VIEWPOINT </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#105:4>
<bold> F </bold> IRST , the good news .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#106:4>
At last , this aspiring world city has something approaching a
world-class museum .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#107:4>
The &dollar;10 I shelled out for an afternoon at the Hong Kong
Museum of History was &dollar;10 well spent . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#108:4>
The Story of Hong Kong Exhibition is beautifully presented .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#109:4>
It aims to tell that story by placing Hong Kong in its geographical
, ecological , historical and cultural perspective .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#110:4>
It does so with varying degrees of success . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#111:4>
The museum has been , I believe , unfairly criticised for
putting too much emphasis on the prehistory and early origins of Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#112:4>
Living in a city of concrete , steel and glass , it  ' s easy to
forget we  ' re part of the landscape of southern China .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#113:4>
The happy and excited faces of the children who ran around this
section of the exhibition asking questions attests to its popularity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#114:4>
I was also moved by the number of senior citizens at the museum
, transfixed as they saw their collective memories reflected back at them .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#115:4>
The most heartening thing was to hear the conversations: the
reminiscences of shared experiences and the communication between one
generation and another .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#116:4>
It was particularly poignant to witness elderly visitors recalling
hardships and struggles in the section on Hong Kong under Japanese occupation
- three years and eight months that left an indelible mark on the territory
and the lives of those who lived through it . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#117:4>
It  ' s no surprise that the recent rewriting of history in a
Japanese textbook by a right-wing group in Japan has created such anger and
resentment from people in Hong Kong , the mainland and the Koreas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#118:4>
The Central Government has argued , quite rightly , that history
should not whitewashed or obliterated .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#119:4>
In facing the present and the future we have to come to terms with
how we got here .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#120:4>
And that applies across the board . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#121:4>
So the bad news about the Story of Hong Kong is the stories it
leaves out .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#122:4>
The regulation of the 1967 riots to a mere mention and the failure
to do even that much for the pro-democracy movement of 1989 are a travesty .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#123:4>
Only at the end of the exhibition , during a show of a long
montage of film and video footage with music do we see images of the unrest
of the 1960s under the title of " Stormy Days" .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#124:4>
Then , under a section titled &ldquo; Blood if Thicker than Water" ,
we get a glimpse of 1989 .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#125:4>
It begins with the commemoration of Hu Yaobang  ' s death and quickly
gives way to shots of what I first thought was the concept held at the
racecourse to support the pro-democracy movement on the mainland , but was in
fact the racecourse fundraiser for blood relief . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#126:4>
Although frustratingly fleeting , these images offered those who
remember these events a moment for reflection . But without any commentary or
voiceover to place them n any context , it would be hard for anyone without
prior knowledge to make any sense of what they saw . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#127:4>
The people of Hong Kong have been told to put down the baggage
of history and move forward .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#128:4>
But when is the remembering of history a burden and when is it
sanctioned , as in the case of the Sino-Japanese war ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#129:4>
Yes , the history of Hong Kong since World War II , or even
since the Opium War , is short compared with the hisroty of human habitation
in this part of the world .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#130:4>
But it has witnessed momentous events that shaped and continued to
sharp our lives today .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#131:4>
Despite a century of British colonisation , our destiny has always
been bound with that of our compatriots on the mainland .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#132:4>
So where are the stories of the impact of the Cultural Revolution ,
of the care packages sent across the border , the corpses washed ashore
during times of famine ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#133:4>
The historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote: &ldquo; The destruction of
the past , or rather of the social mechanisms that link one  ' s contemporary
experience to that of earlier generations , is one of the most characteristic
and eerie phenomena of the late 20th century . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#134:4>
He says that the job of a historian is to remember what other forget .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2B-012#135:4>
A tall order indeed , but a vitally important one .

<ICE-HK:W2B-012#136:4>
The custodians of our past hold the keys to our future , and history
has proved that we forget at our peril . </p>
