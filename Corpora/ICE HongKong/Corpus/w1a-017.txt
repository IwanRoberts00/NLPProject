<ICE-HK:W1A-017#1:1>
The public are not very enthusiastic about the decision making in
public affairs because they know that each outcome is resulted of thousands
of vote .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#2:1>
The vote by him do not have much effect even he knows that one of the
thousand people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#3:1>
<.> <del> Moremo </del> </.> Moreover , it is so costly to get
information about <del> political </del> public affairs .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#4:1>
Such as they have to spend a lot of time to collect information about
candidates to verify their platforms whether <-> revelant </-> <+> relevant
</+> or not .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#5:1>
Meanwhile the candidates expect to attract the median Voter  ' s vote ,
their platforms are quite similar to each other .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#6:1>
In addition , the public think that they only spend a few dollars for
tax , it doesn't worth much to them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#7:1>
So they don't care much about the public affair .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#8:1>
Moreover , the public tend to be a free-rider that means someone get
the benefit without paying for it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#9:1>
As someone can make choice for them , they can benefit from the
decision making . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#10:1>
In considering the &lsquo; one person one vote &rsquo; , there
occurs rational ignorance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#11:1>
As mentioned above , the public are not <-> enthuastic </-> <+>
enthusiastic </+> about the decision making in public affairs , they won't
gather information at the same time , we assume that all the votes are equal
weight , <del> but </del> so <-> tyranncy </-> <+> tyranny </+> of majority
will occur .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#12:1>
But it doesn't reflect the right choice by the majority ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#13:1>
it only means that the majority <.> <del> ow </del> </.> overwhelm
the minority and the minority have to receive a negative externality that
impose by the majority .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#14:1>
Negative externality means that a <del> person received </del> cost
impose on the person that action done by others without the consent of the
person . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#15:1>
In addition , it costs a large of transaction cost if one person
one vote is taken place .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#16:1>
From the optimal decision making rule , we find that more voter <.>
<del> includ </del> </.> involve in the process , the higher the decision
making cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#17:1>
As &lsquo; one person one vote &rsquo; has got externality and high
transaction cost , so it is not economically efficient . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#18:1>
In the case of representative of functional constituencies
because of they know that he would benefit from the election because they are
interest group that is one of the bureaux , they can get benefit from the tax
, so they have interest to collect information . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#19:1>
But since they are bureaucrats , they have to keep their power
&ampersand; prestige , so <del> they </del> their method to be budget
maximization.

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#20:1>
That means they will often overestimate the demand &ampersand; supply
more than the market <del> <.> mark </.> </del> demand so the consumer exert
consumer surplus from <-> bureacrats </-> <+> bureaucrats </+> . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#21:1>
As the representatives comes from different parties , they have
to sell their goodness &ampersand; struggle for the benefit , i.e. more
budget, e.g. the medical and Health Department said that they are important
&ampersand; the hospital is overcrowding , so they <del> they </del> had to
expand the staff .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#22:1>
In other way , the social welfare Department, also claimed that they
are underprivileged but overloaded .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#23:1>
As the special interest group has their own specialise &ampersand; no
private sector can assess their outcome , so they have to expand the budget
to show their importance &ampersand; publicize to the public about their job
nature , so the representative of functional constituencies isn't
economically efficient also . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#24:1>
6 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#25:1>
Besides the government provides social welfare activities , there
are 4 ways that can take place the social welfare activities under the govt  ' s
regulation . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#26:1>
The first one is the govt contract the govt can contract out some
projects to the private form to run urban Council is contract out to private
sector the benefit is after the end of contract , if the contractor performed
dissatisfaction the govt may terminate them .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#27:1>
As the contractor has to tender the contract , they would use the
most efficiency &ampersand; effective method to run the assignment then he
can reduce the cost that is more economically efficiency at the same time ,
he can gain the contract owing to the lowest price . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#28:1>
Moreover , <del> contractor </del> there is competition among
contractors so they could improve their service .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#29:1>
Then it stimulate the contractor to work more efficiency . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#30:1>
The second one is the Voucher system , that the government can
give grant to voucher to private sector to run the welfare such as education
, transport subsidies to full time students .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#31:1>
This aims at easy management to the government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#32:1>
In USA the government gives voucher to the students of parents they
can choose which school they like and sent their children to it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#33:1>
Then the government will receive voucher from school and subsidy it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#34:1>
The benefit of voucher system is attain the characteristics of public
finance but gain the advantage of provide sector .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#35:1>
Because in general , private sector works more <-> efficiency </->
<+> efficiently </+> than the government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#36:1>
Because they have comparison and is under a market mechanism . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#37:1>
Another one is the privatization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#38:1>
one type that the HK government usually do is a Franchise .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#39:1>
That is allow a private sector works as a monopoly supplier but use
regulation to restrict it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#40:1>
The government will regulate it to guarantee the minimum standard of
supply <del> a </del> , though it works as a monopolist but the price is a
competitive market price , for example , the MTR and Bus Company .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#41:1>
They are franchise in Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#42:1>
But they are work under government regulation . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#43:1>
The last one of privatization is the government owned property
but run by private firm ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#44:1>
in Hong Kong the KCR is the example . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#45:1>
Though privatization work under a market mechanism and have
competition among the same industry There are drawback of it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#46:1>
Because of the competition , it reduce the firm  ' s <del> to enter
</del> incentive to enter the firm to avoid extreme conflict .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#47:1>
To the consumer , competition is better .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#48:1>
They can benefit from the price .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#49:1>
Moreover , the firm could respond to <?> <.> <del> consum </del> </.>
</?> consumer in case they have opinions . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#50:1>
The next , because private sectors run under the regulation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#51:1>
The government has send a regulator to oversee the firms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#52:1>
Then the regulator became a <-> bureacrat </-> <+> bureaucrat </+> ,

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#53:1>
it may exist problem in dealing with the private sector .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#54:1>
Then it may also run off and then finally the private sector may be
converted back to public sector . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#55:1>
Lastly, the contract price to private sector <del> to </del> is
difficult to measure because of various types of services and goods .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#56:1>
The government should make a choice to decide . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#57:1>
7 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#58:1>
As cost-benefit analysis is a set of techniques that design to
ensure the scarce resources allocated<-> efficiency</-> <+> efficiently </+>
, we find to list out the steps to allocate public funds . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#59:1>
Firstly , we should identify the objective , to tell the reason
why do that project , not only the content of the <.> <del> j </del> </.>
project , so that we have a Program-budget Planning and a Line-Program Budget .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#60:1>
Program budget is used to list out the expenditure of the objective .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#61:1>
The line-budget <del> is </del> break down the items for budgetting .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#62:1>
Secondly , enumerate the cost &ampersand; benefit .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#63:1>
Whenever we have a budget , not decide to do or not to do , also
include where to do it and the Numbers of projects because each project has
different cost and benefits .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#64:1>
we can't just list out one project , but all program planning to
compare the cost and benefit .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#65:1>
Be careful

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#66:1>
we can easily overlook the benefit or double count the benefit . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#67:1>
Thirdly , it enumerate the options as one social welfare can many
variation to achieve , we should name them all and see the relationship among
the alternatives . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#68:1>
Then because of the ambiguous comparison of values , social cost
and social benefit , so <del> we </del> all of these should convert to dollar
term for convenient calculation . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#69:1>
The last one should be criterion .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#70:1>
There are a number of criteria that can help to achieve the goal ,
such as political .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#71:1>
This factor we had also take into consideration . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#72:1>
Though there are clear steps to follow to make a cost-benefit
analysis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#73:1>
Some problems are involved in it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#74:1>
The first one is the measurement problem , that is how and what to
measure . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#75:1>
a &cbrack; Relevance: as tax easily distort our calculation , we
should carefully calculate the profit . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#76:1>
Net profit should be counted less tax .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#77:1>
Social profit should be counted before tax .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#78:1>
b &cbrack; Shadow price: that is the opportunity cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#79:1>
As monopoly , regulation distort the market price , in evaluating the
cost we should bear in mind the shadow price . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#80:1>
In addition , don't double count the benefit because very often ,
it is not a benefit , but a transfer of purchasing power , for example , a
new airport is build .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#81:1>
The citizen is more convenient , and the buyer has increase .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#82:1>
Then we should only count the benefit for the former one . </p>
<p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#83:1>
c &cbrack; Spill-over effect: That is the externality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#84:1>
But externality will not reflect in market price , so it is difficult
to calculate , eg : pollution . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#85:1>
d &cbrack; Constraint: some political and administrative
constraint resist the planning , that the economists cannot work the most
efficiency project .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#86:1>
For example , the politician may <-> perfer </-> <+> prefer </+>
taxation than widen the road even the latter one is more economic . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#87:1>
The second problem is the <?> invention </?> criteria .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#88:1>
Because there is a &lsquo; time file &rsquo; along the project , we
had to calculate the future benefit and layouts into present value .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#89:1>
The method we used are a &cbrack; discount present rate &obrack; DPV
&cbrack; , that is to <del> calculate </del> discount the future benefit into
present benefit . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#90:1>
b &cbrack; <?> Internate </?> rate of return &obrack; IRR
&cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#91:1>
Calculate the return rate of the project after certain years .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#92:1>
But <del> we <.> cus </.> </del> the more popular method is Discount
Present Rate because it is logically than IRR , and it has a single choice
where as the IRR has more preference .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#93:1>
Also IRR prioritize the choices contradict to DPV . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#94:1>
<del> The last one is uncertainty </del> Moreover the investment
rate also fluctuated due to political factors and difficult to choose an
appropriate interest rate or discount rate . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#95:1>
The last problem is the uncertainty , since a project last for
many years , it will <?> encounter </?> the uncertainty such as political
factors , economic inflation , the instability of rate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#96:1>
<?> <del> Then </del> </?> Nevertheless , the government  ' s
involvement also distort the market , such as it change its policy , allow
other products exists , taxation affect the net profit that will compete with
social welfare programmes . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#97:1>
3 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#98:1>
Before explain Coase Theorem , I would first explain the terms
<mention> externality </mention> and <mention> non-excludability </mention> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#99:1>
Externality is that the production or consumption of <del> a </del>
good or services that the business or consumer hadn't pay it &ampersand; when
there is spill over effects it won't reflect in market price .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#100:1>
The most common externality we encounter is the negative externality
and positive externality .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#101:1>
Negative externality means that a cost impose on a person that the
action done by others without the consent of the person .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#102:1>
While positive externality is the one gain a benefit from the action
done by others without paying for it . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#103:1>
Non-excludability is that everyone has the <del> The negative
externality is found common in HK is pollution The factor </del> right to
participate in the action .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#104:1>
In general the cost for non-excludable goods are high .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#105:1>
If the good are non-excludable , they are usually two <?> bids </?> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#106:1>
One <del> <unc> 1-character </unc> </del> is the pure public
goods that usually <.> <del> distrib </del> </.> provide directly thro ' the
government or private sector contracted by the government .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#107:1>
And it is distributed via public budget eg. the defense .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#108:1>
Another type of non-excludable goods is a mixed good with the
combined nature of rival for example , the swimming pool , parks .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#109:1>
They are finance out of charges and the non-excludability is subject
to crowding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#110:1>
This kind of good can be provided by private and public sectors .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#111:1>
The common negative externality we encounter is pollution .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#112:1>
As in Tsuen Wan , it is a polluted area , but it is not owing to one
factory , but many many factories .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#113:1>
The producer hadn't calculate the social cost they put and take
advantages from using clean air .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#114:1>
As pollution isn't a new problem , the government cannot combat it
but to abate it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#115:1>
As the property rights is poorly defined <del> And the </del> we
can't define who own the air .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#116:1>
And the transaction cost is high because the factories are difficult
to compensate every residents in Tsuen Wan .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#117:1>
So , the government can intervene in the situation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#118:1>
The government can use regulation to abate pollution to reduce the
transaction cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#119:1>
Because pollution is a problem of externality and air is
non-excludability , everyone can use it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#120:1>
From Coase Theorem if the one involved in the transaction are
willing to trade , the one <del> who </del> will get it who value it at the
most valuation as the government enact regulation and taxation to the firms .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#121:1>
They can choose continue their their industry or shut it down .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#122:1>
Another example is the lamp that install the ladder .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#123:1>
The one who install the lamp pay the cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#124:1>
Their neighbour can also enjoy the <del> <.> <?> extern </?> </.>
</del> benefit without paying it .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#125:1>
In this case , because the transactional cost is low , they can
internalize the externalities .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#126:1>
The lamp owner can get <-> compormise </-> <+> compromise </+> with
his neighbour to eliminate free rider , but it costs a higher transaction
cost .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#127:1>
If he install the lamp by himself , he own the property right of the
lamp . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#128:1>
1 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#129:1>
The case that Bought Place Scheme <del> is </del> VS Direct
Subsidy Scheme for private school .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#130:1>
The latter one has a more efficiency and utility gain from the DSS .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#131:1>
As before , government bought Place for Private School .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#132:1>
it seemed that they have less freedom to run the school , because
the students are distributed through computer system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#133:1>
The school would receive the students .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#134:1>
As the government paid them a lump sum to buy place , they need not
to worry about the finance because it comes from the government . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#135:1>
As it change to Direct Subsidy Scheme , the school is chosen by
students or parents .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#136:1>
They can choose the school that they think runs efficiency and reach
the aided school standard

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#137:1>
if the school is understandard , the parents will not consider it
because DSS the government will subsidy the private school <del> owning
</del> owing to students that they can collect .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#138:1>
And the subsidize will deduct the school  ' s fee income so that the
school can't <del> become </del> be profiteering . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#139:1>
As the school is chosen by students or parents fewer students
means less income and subsidy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#140:1>
Then they would tried to run efficiency , such as improve the
standard of teaching , enlarge more facilities to help teaching , provide
attractive activities .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#141:1>
Otherwise they will shut down .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#142:1>
Moreover , the private school is enhance to compete , they will have
various methods to improve , thus the schools will become variety .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#143:1>
It provides more opportunities for school .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#144:1>
And the school has more freedom to run

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#145:1>
it gives them a greater utility . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#146:1>
b &cbrack; Public transport subsidy paid to the transport
companies reinforce the student to take more transportation even they are not
in need .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#147:1>
And it limited the uses of students about the subsidy because the
subsidy is directly to transport companies .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#148:1>
It means that their income effect has <del> to </del> no change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#149:1>
If they have cash subsidy , that means they have increase their
income effect . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#150:1>
As the student increase the income effect , the consumption line
will shift upwards .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#151:1>
it means that they have a greater utility than before .

<ICE-HK:W1A-017#152:1>
As shown by the figure , after students receives <-> subsides </->
<+> subsidies </+> , they can sometimes give up transports means but instead
of walking or by other luxury goods such as taxi . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#153:1>
Moreover , to use the money more<-> efficiency</-> <+>
efficiently </+> , the student will choose the most appropriate means to the
destination . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-017#154:1>
So , subsidy cash to student is similar to Direct subsidy scheme
for Private schools , is more <-> efficiency </-> <+> efficient </+> and
utility gains of the recipients . </p> </I>
