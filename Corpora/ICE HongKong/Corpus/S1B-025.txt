Good evening this is Newsline

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X2:1:Z>
I  ' m Maureen Boyd

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X3:1:Z>
Tonight we  ' ll ask whether Hong Kong is doing enough for physically
and mentally disabled and we  ' ll take a look at some health and medical
issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X4:1:Z>
Joining T L Tsim and me tonight is the Secretary for Health and
Welfare Elizabeth Wong and two legislative councillors Doctor Leong Chi Hung
and Eric Li

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X5:1:Z>
Welcome to the show all of you

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X6:1:Z>
Elizabeth Wong let us start by talking about the government Green
Paper on rehabilitation you released last month

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X7:1:Z>
Now it got a pretty rough ride in uh Legislative Council debate
last weak uh councillors uh uh quote gave accused the government of being
miserly and shortsighted

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X8:1:Z>
Your colleague do over there Eric Li said he was ashamed of the
treatment given to the physically and mentally disable

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X9:1:Z>
How how do you respond to <{> <[> them </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#10:1:A>
<[> First </[> </{> of all we are consulting so I welcome all
shades of comments and I think there  ' s nothing like public criticism that
focuses the mind

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#11:1:A>
Uhm on the other hand I think we must speak with uhm uh certain
facts uh to support what we say

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#12:1:A>
In terms of expenditure we have come a long way from uh a hundred
and twenty one million and nineteen seventy six to two point two billion <,>
dollars last year two point five billion dollars this year

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#13:1:A>
So that  ' s not uh uh a mean <,> uh expansion

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#14:1:A>
However I do think that we may have got the <.> po </.> policy
focal point not quite right

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#15:1:A>
And whole purpose of the Green Paper is to refocus <,> uh to take
the initiative to stand back take stock and <.> refo </.> focus on important
issues

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#16:1:A>
Societies change demand changes <{1> <[1> aspiration </[1> <{2>
<[2> changes </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#17:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X18:1:Z>
<[2> Eric </[2> </{2> Li <{> <[> what  ' s </[> your motion

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X19:1:Z>
What what do you want the government to do </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#20:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#21:1:B>
I I think it  ' ll it or besides being as a time for refocusing I
think it is also opportunity for us to take stock what has been done

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#22:1:B>
Uh I I think if the government is brave to actually come out with a
paper actually uh stating <{> <[> the shortfall </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X23:1:Z>
<[> But did </[> </{> they get it right in the paper </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#24:1:B>
I think they  ' ve got a lot of it right

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#25:1:B>
Uh there  ' s still uh shortfalls

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#26:1:B>
Obviously we don't think it  ' s a perfect paper otherwise uh it do
not require any consultation

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#27:1:B>
But does give a chance for the public to reflect their their view
on the paper whether we  ' ve done enough

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#28:1:B>
I think we are less uh perhaps uh easily satisfied uh than the
perhaps the government

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X29:1:Z>
Doctor <{> <[> Leong </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#30:1:C>
<[> Well </[> </{> I I don't think we should be that easily
satisfied

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#31:1:C>
I mean you know <?> Lib Libby </?> has said that uh you know uhm uh
things have changed

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#32:1:C>
Now this is fifteen years since the last <,> policy paper on
rehabilitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#33:1:C>
I feel that really <,> really should look in whole matter and
really make things right now

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#34:1:C>
There  ' re two areas which I think is <,> pretty deficient in in the
Green Paper itself

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#35:1:C>
Firstly is that it does not take into consideration of quite a few
<,> medical problems that we need rehabilitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#36:1:C>
Take an example people chronic illness take an example people
without a voice box who can't speak

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#37:1:C>
The other area which I think is even more important is community
rehabilitation projects

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#38:1:C>
Now when somebody <,> is treated in hospital they get
rehabilitation there but they want they will have to go out of hospital

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#39:1:C>
And the majority will hopefully never goes back to hospital

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#40:1:C>
It  ' s here where rehabilitation should really take the full brunt

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#41:1:D>
Right and I think the Green Paper is helping to focus on those
issues <,> but as communities become richer uh as Mrs Wong said they do <{>
<[> change aspiration and </[> uh what we may be <,> going through one of
these phrases

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#42:1:D>
Uh is there a lot of <,> agreement within the profession <,> that
certain thing should be done first

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#43:1:D>
In other words do you have <,> some kind of general consensus on
priorities

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#44:1:C>
<[> Yeah yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#45:1:A>
I uh sorry uhm I think <.> con </.> general consensus is
important because that will in fact allow the government to focus right and
give the right priority

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#46:1:A>
But going back to what Doctor Leong has said uh he is absolutely
right to say that uhm society needs have change

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#47:1:A>
And we need to focus <,> and refocus on community health

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#48:1:A>
And what he has suggested is uh medical rehabilitation that whole
chapter on medical rehabilitation and it also interfaces with primary health
care with the health reform that we want to do uh throughout Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#49:1:A>
Uh <,> we need <{1> <[1> prioritization </[1> and in that respect I
do welcome professional officers  '  uhm advice on how to do it how to get it
<{2> <[2> right </[2>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#50:1:D>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X51:1:Z>
<[2> Well </[2> </{2> you haven't made any suggestions on cash
allocations for various projects your special <{> <[> timetables </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#52:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#53:1:A>
Uh because this is Green Paper it is not a government decision

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#54:1:A>
It is a consultative document

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#55:1:A>
Uhm by the time we <?> got </?> all the ideas in then we will have
to draft the White Paper which is a government statement for future direction

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#56:1:A>
In the White Paper normally we  ' ll have an <?> implementational
</?> programme and reasons why we implement it in certain ways

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#57:1:A>
So uhm uh Green Paper normally precedes White you know

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#58:1:B>
I think there are some consensus despite the fact that uh <,>
uh what we show

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#59:1:B>
I think in the motion <,> uh one part that  ' s accepted by all
councillors and also the the general public is that first of all we <,> we do
want it to be done quick <,> quicker than what has been planned

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#60:1:B>
One of these is the message seems that we can only deal with all
these things within ten years

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#61:1:B>
I think there  ' s strong consensus that we want to do it <,> much
quicker

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#62:1:B>
Let  ' s say five years

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#63:1:B>
The other is the other aspect is the community support

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#64:1:B>
I think that uh the government <,> uh it should be taking a a
greater lead <,> in encouraging the <,> wider community to support both
financially in in terms of attitude change <{> <[> and <unc> three-words
</unc> </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X65:1:Z>
<[> Eric Lee is it your </[> </{> view that we need more money to
do that

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X66:1:Z>
I mean now less than half of one percent of uh Hong Kong  ' s uh GDP
is spent on social welfare </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#67:1:B>
That  ' s not uh <,> nearly enough

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#68:1:B>
I can quote figures uh for example uh I  ' ve act actually calculated
<,> if we use general public expenditure we  ' re spending something like
twenty thousand dollar per person <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#69:1:B>
The fact that the rehabilitation service is is quite isolated from
all the rest of the main stream services

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#70:1:B>
I mean that for example transport <,> uh disabled person cannot
enjoy the normal person  ' s uh transport <.> fac </.> facilities

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#71:1:B>
They  ' re they  ' re all completely isolated

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#72:1:B>
And we take that two <,> billion and divided by what the government
said there  ' s twenty two hundred and seventy thousand people

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#73:1:B>
But the figure I  ' ve showed is about seven thousand <{> <[> dollars
five hundred <?> dollar </?> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#74:1:A>
<[> Uh I I think here </[> </{> <,> there may be some <.>
misunders </.> understanding in that uh in terms of the cash spending we know
exactly what the government is spending

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#75:1:A>
But there are so many areas of uh <,> spending which are not
identified as public expenditure

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#76:1:A>
For instance the transport uh facility the subsidies that go on uh
in in Hong Kong elsewhere

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#77:1:A>
And uhm when we talk about moving faster greater progress I think
we are <,> we are we have the common goal of trying to achieve <?> within
</?> shorter space of time <,> to do the right thing even <,> uh do it
overnight

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X78:1:Z>
But what about the short shortfall of eight hundred and ten <?>
bands </?> for the <{> <[> severely mentally handicapped </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#79:1:A>
<[> Actually once that  ' s right </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#80:1:A>
But once identified the shortfall then I think the uhm <,> uh
solution will be there because even as recently as last month we  ' ve got a uh
an overall plan as to how to overcome the current shortfall of eight hundred

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#81:1:A>
But if we were to relate to <,> the perpetual short <unc>
one-word </unc> uhm you know there  ' s no such things as meeting full
demand in any society

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#82:1:A>
Cause we we demand catches up the better you do it the better
people want it and therefore you  ' re forever catching up with the demand

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#83:1:A>
It is call the theory of perpetual motion but having said that I
think both the uhm uh colleagues in the branch and also people who are on the
committees of <.> rehab </.> rehabilitation

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#84:1:A>
They want to get sort it out the whole thing sort it out meet the
shortfall <?> within </?> five years

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#85:1:A>
Now it means a joint effort between not only the government but the
community at large

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#86:1:A>
But therefore if the government doesn't do it uh then shame on the
government

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#87:1:A>
If the community doesn't <{1> <[1> do it then shame </[1> on the
<{2> <[2> community </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#88:1:B>
<[1> Uhm <unc> one-word </unc> </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X89:1:Z>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2> there  ' s two hundred seventy thousand
disabled people in the territory with some forty two percent being uhm
mentally handicapped

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X90:1:Z>
Uh certainly much smaller groups have their own functional
constituencies <?> seat </?> in Legislative Council

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X91:1:Z>
Do you hold out much hope that this group will get their own Legco
seat </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#92:1:A>
Certainly this is a point of view very much supported by
members of my working party

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#93:1:A>
And uh we we can also learn from experience elsewhere in the United
States <,> in UK

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#94:1:A>
In Japan they have a national focal point

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#95:1:A>
And I think it will be uhm uh very good if we could have some sort
of representation uhm a kind of advocate if you like

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#96:1:A>
Uhm but mind mind you I think uh in this area I it it  ' s really an
area where I defer my <{> <[> friend  ' s comment </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X97:1:Z>
<[> Okay Doctor </[> </{> Leong <{> <[> let  ' s </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#98:1:C>
<[> I I I  ' m </[> </{> uhm uh I agree with uh <?> Libby </?>
that you know some form of representation <,> is definitely needed but I like
to bring bring out two points

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#99:1:C>
One point is that now who <,> will be the represent representative

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#100:1:C>
In other words will it be a person from the disabled <,> group or
would be a person who working for disabled group and that  ' s first point

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#101:1:C>
The second point is that who will be the voters

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#102:1:C>
Will it be the disabled people who will voting or will just the
people working for the disabled will be voting <{> <[> I I think that  ' s
important </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#103:1:D>
<[> I am <.> com </.> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#104:1:D>
I  ' m completely opposed to functional constituencies <{1> <[1> <,>
uh </[1> I I really think we should go for direct <{2> <[2> election </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#105:1:C>
<[1> Well basically </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#106:1:C>
<[2> I I agree </[2> </{2> with you T L <{> <[> uh </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#107:1:D>
<[> And </[> </{> have a House of Lords for all the
professionals like doctors and lawyers and <{> <[> accountants </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#108:1:C>
<[> You you know that </[> </{> that  ' s that  ' s interesting I
mean I I represent a functional <.> constit </.> but I would agree with you
entirely <,> that functional <.> constituen </.> is not exactly the best way
out

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#109:1:C>
But having had <,> to have functional <.> constituen </.> for the
next <,> I don't know <{> <[> how many years </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X110:1:Z>
<[> Eric Li  ' s trying to </[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#111:1:B>
<[> I  ' m <?> stand </?> </[> </{> to be corrected I <?> stand
</?> to be corrected

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#112:1:B>
But if you look at all the <,> the uh <,> the policies of the
various of people who come <,> come up for direct election

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#113:1:B>
Uh the rehabilitation uh disabled body doesn't feature very much
at all in the their work and also their <{1> <[1> on their platform </[1> so
far and uh <{2> <[2> I stand to be corrected but </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#114:1:C>
<[1> That  ' s right </[1> </{1>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#115:1:D>
<[2> There  ' s certainly a lot of </[2> </{2> social workers
<{> <[> a lot of teachers and social workers </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#116:1:B>
<[> They have but what have </[> </{> they done so far

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#117:1:B>
Uh I  ' m appointed member it  ' s up to me to raise this

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#118:1:B>
Uh the geographical spread of disabled person they all spread out
<{> <[> you know various uh </[> places

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#119:1:B>
They  ' re less than five percent of the total population

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#120:1:B>
They belong to <.> minori </.> minority group

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#121:1:B>
At this stage and age people like them will be ignored if they are
not protected and given a <,> a uh champion

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#122:1:C>
<[> Are all they </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X123:1:Z>
Well something pointed out in Green Paper was the lack of the
legislative measures to protect the <.> dis </.> the rights of the disabled

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X124:1:Z>
Elizabeth Wong are you going to pushing for more legislation <{>
<[> I mean right now you </[> the advocate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#125:1:A>
<[> Uh I think uh </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#126:1:A>
Well yes I think there are certain areas of legislation that needs
to be uh reformed

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#127:1:A>
Uhm because we  ' ve got the for example uh mental health ordinance

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#128:1:A>
<unc> one-word </unc> and there is a move uhm <,> uh there
are calls that the mental health uh ordinance doesn't cover or shouldn't
cover all sorts of mental handicap

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#129:1:A>
It should be divided <,> into a separate ordinance

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#130:1:A>
But there are pros and cons each way but I think it be wrong to
use the law <,> to ask for uh services

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#131:1:A>
Because services would have to be provided whether or not there is
a law

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#132:1:A>
And the law is not an instrument for <,> pushing for services

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#133:1:A>
But law it would be an instrument in my opinion for justifying uh
and uh looking after the the areas uhm where individual themselves may not be
able to look after themselves

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#134:1:A>
So it is a question of <,> guardianship law that we need to be
reexamining and the Green Paper has gone into great detail

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#135:1:A>
And we feel that this <?> area </?> which needs to be addressed by
the law commission

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X136:1:Z>
Well in other areas uh you have rejected tax concessions uh and
other <.> meths </.> methods of encouraging employment for the disabled <,>
why </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#137:1:A>
I think tax concession in a Hong Kong uhm philosophy is
probably a bit complicated

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#138:1:A>
Because Hong Kong law is very tax law is very simple

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#139:1:A>
Kong Hong Kong tax is on a base on the four schedule system

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#140:1:A>
And that we  ' ve got a very low tax structure uh to complicate it
with in in an exemption would is going to be neither here nor there

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#141:1:A>
And indeed it can be equally argued <,> uh that uhm to provide an
exemption to <.> en </.> encourage employers to employ <?> disable </?> <,>
people is a form of discrimination in fact

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#142:1:A>
You are trying to <,> you know force uh through the law a
discriminatory structure the very thing we  ' re going to toss out <,>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#143:1:A>
Because <{> <[> Hong Kong </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X144:1:Z>
<[> What about </[> localization in the in the civil service </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#145:1:C>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#146:1:A>
In civil service we we <.> en </.> we are quite uhm uh good I
think by comparison

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#147:1:A>
We have two <.> per </.> two percent of our civil servants are in
one way or another handicapped

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#148:1:A>
And uhm and the we are the best employers of <?> handicap </?>
people in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#149:1:A>
<{1> <[1> We hope </[1> <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> we can we hope we can
promote other <{3> <[3> organization do the same </[3>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#X150:1:Z>
<[1> Eric Lee </[1> </{1> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#151:1:C>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1B-025#152:1:B>
<[3> I think we we recognize </[3> </{3> that although we  ' re
talking about ideals

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#153:1:B>
Uh there  ' re need to be some incentive to to get things <,> to to
start moving particularly the private sector

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#154:1:B>
We have to talk about incentive we cannot uh simply <,> uh force
people to do things in Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#155:1:B>
Uh on on the tax law I I suddenly see the resistance and the
reason why being an accountant myself

<ICE-HK:S1B-025#156:1:B>
But uh we are not short of having legislation who are <,> <.> whi
</.> which has a social implication like the the <,> the tobacco tax and also
the also the tax on the stamp duty of the <,> the buying and selling of flats
