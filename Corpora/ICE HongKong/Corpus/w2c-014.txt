CHINA yesterday commented for the first time on the proposed
legislation on the Court of Final Appeal . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#4:1>
It said &ldquo; many aspects &rdquo; of the law did not comply
with the Sino-British agreement reached on the court in 1991 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#5:1>
Guo Fengmin , Chinese team leader of the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group &obrack; JLG &cbrack; , said a brief study of the bill found
that it did not fully satisfy the accord reached by the JLG . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#6:1>
Although he refused to disclose which part of the bill he was
referring to , he hinted that one discrepancy was over the nationality
requirement of the five judges . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#7:1>
Under the 1991 agreement , only one overseas judge is allowed at
each trial .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#8:1>
The Chief Justice has to be an ethnic Chinese without a foreign
passport . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#9:1>
The deal has been criticised by legislators and the legal
profession as curbing the flexibility guaranteed in the Basic Law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#10:1>
In April , Britain submitted the draft bill on the setting up of
the court to China .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#11:1>
The Government hopes the court can be established by 1996 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#12:1>
Officials admitted the nationality of the Chief Justice was not
stipulated in the bill , because it was laid down in the Basic Law . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#13:1>
Mr Guo said : &ldquo; The composition was very clearly stated in
the joint agreement .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#14:1>
It must be carried out very strictly . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#15:1>
There were other aspects China would seek to clarify with Britain
at the JLG meeting , but dates and agenda had yet to be fixed , he said .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#16:1>
The Preliminary Working Committee &obrack; PWC &cbrack; agreed
yesterday that the court should be studied by the powerful Preparatory
Committee for the Special Administrative Region . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#17:1>
The PWC  ' s political affairs sub-group said the Preparatory
Committee should be set up in January 1996 to look into transitional matters .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#18:1>
Mr Guo , also a member of the sub-group , would not say whether
the committee would be empowered to make changes to the court if it did not
fit China  ' s requirements . </p> </I>

BRITAIN was claiming there would be a &ldquo; legal vacuum
&rdquo; after 1997 in order to frighten people , a senior Chinese official
said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#22:2>
Chief negotiator of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group &obrack;
JLG &cbrack; Guo Fengmin , rejected accusations by Britain that China was
delaying the study of transitional legal matters in the diplomatic body .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#23:2>
Britain has said that much work has been held up in the JLG
because of the row over political reform , so many colonial laws will not
have been adapted for post-1997 Hong Kong , resulting in a legal vacuum .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#24:2>
Mr Guo said many laws that needed to be localised and adapted had
been settled in JLG meetings . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#25:2>
&ldquo; Why do they keep on spreading those messages about a
legal vacuum , which seem to be very threatening , &rdquo; Mr Guo said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#26:2>
&ldquo; Hong Kong will not face a legal vacuum , there is no
question about that , &rdquo; he said . </p> </I>

<bold> PWC forms group on civil servants </bold> </h> <h>

<bold> By SO LAI-FUN in Beijing </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#29:3>
CHINA  ' s working committee on Hong Kong  ' s transitional matters
will set up a study group on civil servants in an effort for closer ties with
the 180,000-strong administration . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#30:3>
The decision was taken in response to demands from civil service
unions for a formal channel for communication with the Preliminary Working
Committee &obrack; PWC &cbrack; , said Leung Chun-ying , local co-convener of
the PWC  ' s political affairs sub-group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#31:3>
He said the duties of the group were &ldquo; to conduct in-depth
study , collect information , listen to opinions and make reports on the
stability of the civil services  '  system and its team &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#32:3>
Mainland co-convener Xiao Weiyun said Hong Kong  ' s prosperity
hinged on the stability and continuity of the civil service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#33:3>
The 15-member group , chaired by a Hong Kong member , will be
composed largely of members from the territory .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#34:3>
They will report to the political sub-group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#35:3>
China has accused the Government of being hostile to the PWC
because of its refusal to hold formal discussion with government officials on
transitional matters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#36:3>
Mr Leung said he had not discussed seeking government
co-operation for the work of the study group . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#37:3>
&ldquo; We very much hope to listen to civil servants  '  views ,
but if they do not or cannot express their opinions , that is something the
PWC cannot change . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#38:3>
Seven civil service bodies put forward the idea in PWC meetings
held in Hong Kong in May , he stressed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#39:3>
Among the first to join the study group was Wilfred Wong Ying-wai
, a former deputy secretary for the civil service and a political sub-group
member . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#40:3>
Mr Wong conceded that the group would have difficulty in inviting
incumbent civil servants due to the Government  ' s ban on direct contact with
the PWC . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#41:3>
The necessary information could be obtained not only through
formal meetings but through private contacts with individual members , he
said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#42:3>
Mr Wong said it was not suitable for representatives of civil
servant bodies to be members of the group because that would create a
conflict of interest . </p> </I>

<bold> New court proposal expected </bold> </h> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#45:4>
A NEW proposal on the Court of Final Appeal may be made by a
group of barristers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#46:4>
The 12-member Young Barristers  '  Committee of the Bar Council
will today discuss whether to put forward a motion at the Bar  ' s
extraordinary general meeting at the end of September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#47:4>
Member James Cheng Chung-chin , who suggested the motion , said
he basically accepted the 1991 Sino-British Joint Liaison Group &obrack; JLG
&cbrack; agreement on the court but wanted its implementation deferred for
three to five years . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#48:4>
The delay would enable local judges to gain experience so that
sufficient judges could be recruited in Hong Kong , he said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#49:4>
&ldquo; It is not just a problem with the ratio of overseas
judges and local judges , but the broader issue of whether there are
sufficient judges on the bench .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#50:4>
The worry really lies in the quality , &rdquo; Mr Cheng said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#51:4>
&ldquo; It would be difficult to implement the agreement once the
court is established since high-calibre judges might not be found at once .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#52:4>
&ldquo; many of the judges might think of emigrating overseas
around the time of the changeover due to uncertainty , that makes recruitment
even more difficult . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#53:4>
The Judiciary should provide better conditions so as to attract
more senior barristers to join the bench . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#54:4>
He said his view was practical and moderate and was shared by
most members of the committee . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#55:4>
Although the Bar Council had strongly opposed the restrictions ,
the issue would be a stalemate if they maintained their disapproval without
giving concrete proposals . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#56:4>
Mr Cheng foresaw strong opposition from some members of the Bar
Council , but said &ldquo; there are many barristers in the association
&rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#57:4>
It is believed the bill on the Court of Final Appeal modelled on
the JLG agreement was submitted to the Chinese side in May .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#58:4>
The issue will be discussed by the JLG in late September . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#59:4>
According to the deal , the court shall consist of five judges at
any sitting , comprising the Chief Justice and three permanent Hong Kong
judges , who may be local or expatriate .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#60:4>
The remaining one may , depending on the needs of the particular case
, be drawn from a list of non-permanent Hong Kong judges or one from other
common law jurisdictions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#61:4>
The legal profession was vocal in objecting to the restriction on
overseas judges .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#62:4>
They said flexibility in employing judges would be curbed , thus
compromising the quality of the court . </p> </I>

THE controversial centre for former mental patients in Laguna
City looks likely to play a role in September  ' s district board polls . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#66:5>
The pressure group , Movement Against Discrimination , is to send
questionnaires to all election candidates this week , asking their position
on such centres and on equal opportunities legislation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#67:5>
The group , composed of more than 30 organisations and
individuals , will announce the results and make suggestions on the choice of
candidates close to the September 18 polling day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#68:5>
Spokesman Mak Hoi-wah , a United Democrat , said the body did not
aim to attack individual candidates .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#69:5>
It simply wanted to arouse public concern and give voters some
reference to make the right choice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#70:5>
However , he said he was concerned about the election platform of
Liberal Party member Johnny Lui Chi-wah , who is standing in the Lai Kong
constituency , which includes Laguna City . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#71:5>
Mr Lui is the spokesman for a taskforce which has staked out the
Laguna City rehabilitation centre and has used videos and cameras to take
pictures of patients since it opened in March . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#72:5>
Residents in the task-force say they feel threatened by the home
, the Kwun Tong Amity Centre , and wanted it moved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#73:5>
Mr Lui has said that proposed laws outlawing discrimination
against people with physical or mental disabilities deprive residents of
their right to protect themselves from attacks by former mental patients .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#74:5>
Mr Mak said : &ldquo; We do not intend to be against any
particular person , but electing Mr Lui to the board certainly will not help
eliminate discrimination and will not foster equal opportunities . &rdquo;
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#75:5>
Another group member , John Tse Wing-ling , said he hoped social
workers in the constituency estate would run against Mr Lui . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#76:5>
Mr Tse , a United Democrat who is to stand for the Wan Chai
District Board , said it was &ldquo; shameful &rdquo; that community leaders
were making use of residents  '  ignorance to gain popularity in elections .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#77:5>
&ldquo; Discrimination demonstrated by district boards has been
quite serious .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#78:5>
Recently two district boards rejected providing facilities for
Filipino maids , and we don't want the trend to continue . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#79:5>
But it was hard to find suitable candidates because &ldquo;
nobody is willing to be under constant pressure and intimidation from some
irrational residents &rdquo; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#80:5>
Mr Lui said last night that his platform did not mention
discrimination , saying the subject was abstract and difficult to define .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#81:5>
Equal opportunity was too general a concept for district boards :

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#82:5>
&ldquo; It does not affect people  ' s livelihood . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#83:5>
Although he supported rehabilitation facilities in &ldquo; every
district &rdquo; , he was opposed to the Government  ' s implementation of the
policy in his estate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#84:5>
He refused to say whether he would call in his election platform
for the centre to be moved . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#85:5>
He reserved the right not to answer the questionnaires because
they were an attempt to smear him , he said . </p> </I>

<bold> Ants step up pressure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#87:6>
LIBERAL pressure group the United Ants yesterday distributed
flyers to a Yuen Long constituency as part of its campaign against Meeting
Point legislator Zachary Wong Wai-yin . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#88:6>
The 5,000 flyers , distributed in Long Ping where Mr Wong will
seek to extend his district board term of office , urged residents to stand
for the pool to widen their choice . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#89:6>
Core member Ho Sau-lan said the group did not want voters to
choose only between Mr Wong and the candidate from the Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong , Chan Siu-ching . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#90:6>
The group has urged Meeting Point legislators to resign because
they abstained in a vote on their Legco colleague Emily Lau Wai-hing  ' s bill
seeking a fully directly elected legislature . </p>

Hostel for &lsquo; caged men &rsquo; gets off to slow start </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#93:7>
By NG KANG-CHUNG </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#94:7>
HONGKONG  ' s first hostel run by a voluntary agency for &ldquo;
caged men &rdquo; has received a cool response , with an 80 per cent vacancy
rate two months after opening . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#95:7>
Some welfare groups argue that potential lodgers are being
discouraged by the strict admission requirements of the Wan Chai hostel ,
which is managed by the Agency for Volunteer Service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#96:7>
But the agency attributes Tak Nga House  ' s low occupancy to a
lack of publicity . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#97:7>
Since the 80-place hostel opened last November , only 15 single
lodgers who have passed all the requirements have been admitted . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#98:7>
The agency plans to seek help from other welfare organisations to
publicise the hostel , which opened as part of a government plan to relieve
overcrowding in bed-space apartments in Hongkong . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#99:7>
The Government is co-operating with voluntary agencies to offer
accommodation to single lodgers by converting some old properties into
hostels for them . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#100:7>
Tak Nga House requires all applicants for places to be under the
age of 60 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#101:7>
They have to prove they are <it> bona fide </it> bed-space
apartment tenants and that they are capable of paying the monthly rent .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#102:7>
Preference is given to those living in Wan Chai . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#103:7>
A social worker with the Society for Community Organisation ,
Miss Lai Yuen-mei said : &ldquo; We have tried to refer some single lodgers
to the hostel .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#104:7>
But none of the cases have been successful because our clients
cannot meet all the requirements . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#105:7>
&ldquo; I hope the agency can relax the requirements to allow
lodgers older than 60-years-old or living in other districts to apply so as
not to waste the places . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#106:7>
Mr Joseph Chan Kin-key , the principal assistant to the Agency
for Volunteer Service  ' s director , said the hostel was still new to the
caged men and he hoped occupancy might rise after the Lunar New Year . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#107:7>
&ldquo; We admit that the occupancy rate is a bit low .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#108:7>
But the hostel has opened only for two months and perhaps some caged
men have not heard of it, &rdquo; Mr Chan said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#109:7>
Mr Chan said admission requirements were set by the Government
and the agency had no right to change them on its own .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#110:7>
But he disputed that the requirements were too harsh . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#111:7>
A government spokesman also discounted the claims . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#112:7>
&ldquo; We believe the requirements are reasonable, &rdquo; the
spokesman said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-014#113:7>
&ldquo; For example , the Social Welfare Department will arrange
public flats for those old people over 60-years-old if necessary .

<ICE-HK:W2C-014#114:7>
So they need not apply for the hostel places . &rdquo; </p> </I>
