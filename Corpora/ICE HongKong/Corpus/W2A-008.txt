<it> Mid-Autumn Festival </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#4:1>
No matter a hunting , a collecting , or an agricultural society ,
the everyday life of Chinese is closely related <it> nature </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#5:1>
Under an uncertain and uncontrollable environment , Chinese in the old
days totally relied on the <it> kindness </it> and <it> giving </it> of
nature &obrack;  Tao &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#6:1>
Among thousands of natural objects , the moon was one of the most
difficult things and incredible phenomena for Chinese to understand .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#7:1>
Originally , Chinese celebrated their harvest with the moon only
involving the activities of family union and admiring &obrack;  watching &cbrack; the moon .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#8:1>
It was not considered as a sacred/religious &obrack;  Ho &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#9:1>
In fact , the English word <it> religion </it> , coming as it does
from the Latin <it> religio </it> , is usually taken to signify a bond
between the human and the divine .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#10:1>
Scholars have had difficulty applying this sense to the Chinese
context , and some even go so far as to say that the dimension of
transcendence is itself lacking in the Chinese spiritual universe &obrack;  Ching 2 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#11:1>
Tao also stated that the word <it> religion </it> &obrack;  tsung-chiao &cbrack; did
not exists in the Chinese vocabulary until late nineteenth century. <sp> 1
</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#12:1>
Nevertheless , as the degree of difficulty for understanding the
moon or a phenomenon of to &obrack;  e.g. , full-moon or no-moon &cbrack; increased , the
number of myths <sp> 2 </sp> and activities related to it was increased
correspondingly &obrack;  Eliade &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#13:1>
Take for example , in the old days Chinese discovered that plants
grew at night , so people thought that moon provided life for plants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#14:1>
Besides , people did not understand why the shape of moon always
changed , so they associated that phenomenon to the lives of people and
animals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#15:1>
Although Chinese tried to understand the moon more and use tit as the
main reference for setting up a calendar , myth-creating has not stopped .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#16:1>
In contrast , while people tried to understand more about the moon ,
more myths and stories were created . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#17:1>
Because of the indispensable and closed relationship between the
moon and the daily life , the Chinese started to associate their primordial
celebration of the harvest with the moon &obrack;  Sung &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#18:1>
In general , autumn is the best tine for harvesting and gathering
crops .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#19:1>
The Chinese character of autumn also means it is a good time for
harvesting .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#20:1>
Since the Shang Dynasty &obrack;  1557-1027 BC &cbrack; , Chinese have agreed that
the eighth Lunar moon is the happiest day for celebrating the harvest .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#21:1>
However , it is difficult to trace when Chinese started to call the
eighth full-moon day <sp> 3 </sp> as Mid-Autumn Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#22:1>
According to a Chinese legend , <it> Tang-Ming </it> &obrack;  a king of the
<it> Moon-Palace </it> and he started to have great formal celebration in his
palace &obrack;  Ching &cbrack; . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#23:1>
The Change </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#24:1>
Later , legends were created and people tried to involve more
materials , objects and events in the celebration - the Mid-Autumn Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#25:1>
As a foreigner living in Peking , Lowe &obrack;  31 &cbrack; described the festival
in his diary: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#26:1>
The Mid-Autumn Festival the fifteenth of the eight moon , is
usually accompa-nied by the fine weather for at this time the moon shines
brightest , the sky is clear and often free from all atmospheric
interferences...gathering under the moon-light it is often the family &lsquo;
s pleasure to recount legends about the moon and its imaginary inhabitants .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#27:1>
Such mythical stories based no doubt on the black spots on the face
of the moon are legion... one such is the one about the beautiful <it>
Chang-O </it> who fled to the moon. <sp> 4 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#28:1>
Generally , the festival consists three fundamental <it> meanings
</it> : gathering , thanksgiving , and praying &obrack;  asking for the conceptual
and material satisfaction &cbrack; &obrack;  Tao &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#29:1>
According to these meanings , different kinds of traditions and myths
were formed and re-enacted periodically. <sp> 5 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#30:1>
Also , most of those traditions and activities were related to the
supernatural beings and sacred concepts &obrack;  see Figure 1 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#31:1>
For example , Chinese believed rabbits looked at the moon to induce
pregnancy and the moon could conceive shells to have pearls as brighten as
the moon .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#32:1>
Also , women thought that <it> Chang-O </it> was beautiful so women
needed to pray to her for keeping their beauty . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#33:1>
Nowadays , the meanings and the activities of the festival are
differ-ent from the old days .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#34:1>
For the reason of the moon-landing , the in creased understanding of
science , and the influence of foreign economy , different cultures and
religions , Chinese started to change their concepts of the festival &obrack;  Tao &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#35:1>
Ho reminds that change has been started and continued for along time
, but not only started at the Qing Dynasty as most of the people think that
it is the time for China to contact with foreign countries &obrack;  Ho &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#36:1>
Ho &obrack;  182-226 &cbrack; provides a lot of examples to prove the moon-culture
has been changed since the New-Stone-Age .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#37:1>
Moreover , these kinds of changes have not only occurred in the outer
and the intermediate levels , but also in the inner level if the spatial
dimension in different temporal layers*** of the mood culture &obrack;  see Figure 2&
3 , and Table 1 &cbrack; </p> <O> A figure </O> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#38:1>
<it> Lanterns in Chinese festivals </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#39:1>
Nearly every Chinese can answer moon-cakes and lanterns as two
popular objects - symbols - closely related to the Mid-Autumn Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#40:1>
For the reason eating is important for Chinese , the traditional
meaning <sp> 7 </sp> and several plebeians revolution-legends <sp> 8 </sp>
about moon-cakes , it is not difficult to understand why Chinese has started
to make moon-cakes since the Song Dynasty &obrack;  906-1279 AD &cbrack; and relate it with
the festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#41:1>
Besides working as a lighting artifact using outdoor places it is
difficult to find pout a definite reason and the beginning time for lanterns
to be used with the moon-worship activities .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#42:1>
We can only be sure that lantern was not used for the moon-worship &obrack; 
or the Mid-Autumn Festival &cbrack; before the Tang Dynasty &obrack;  Wang &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#43:1>
Nevertheless , the lantern has its long history in China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#44:1>
It is a symbol of fertility in Chinese culture besides other special
meanings &obrack;  Eberhard &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#45:1>
<it> Wen Hua Sheng Hou Sho Tse </it> &obrack;  <it> The Handbook of Cultural
Lives </it>  &cbrack; mentions lantern has been close related to the sacred and the
culture activities for more than two thousand years &obrack;  Wen Hua Sheng Huo Sho
Tse &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#46:1>
For this long period of time , some of the shapes , materials
functions and uses of lanterns &obrack;  outer level of the spatial dimension of the
lantern-culture &cbrack; have been changed greatly &obrack;  see Table 2 &cbrack; . </p> <O> 2
figures </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#47:1>
In the old days , the shapes and the images of lanterns were
mainly related to the nature , myths and <it> local </it> cultures in
individual regions of China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#48:1>
Later , the shapes were changed and the techniques for making them
were matched and dissolved with other cultures

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#49:1>
The appearance , forms and functions were changed from simple and
local to complex and mix-cultured .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#50:1>
Other arts of Chinese were also combined to the lantern design , such
as writing blessing sentences or poems on the surface of <O> a figure </O>
lanterns .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#51:1>
Shih adds that nowadays there are more than fifty major types of
lanterns used in different regions of China for different purposes with
different shapes and colors &obrack;  Shih &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#52:1>
Concepts and functions of lanterns - - the inner level of the
spatial dimension of the lantern-culture - have also been changed since the
Tang Dynasty &obrack;  Ho &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#53:1>
For instance , the function of lanterns involved in the Mid-Autumn
Festival was changed from a toy as a decoration item to being a <it> symbol
</it> of the festival &obrack;  Eberhard &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#54:1>
Because of these differences , the variety of colors , forms , sizes
, functions , values and the <it> meaning </it> of the activities related to
the festival became more and more , richer and richer .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#55:1>
Moreover , concepts and activities of other Chinese festivals were
also transmitted or substituted into the Mid-Autumn Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#56:1>
Take for example , lanterns of melon-skin in the Mid-Autumn Festival
is the transformation of the lotus-leaf lanterns in the <it> Chung-yuan
</it> , <sp> 9 </sp> and putting lanterns on rivers in the Mid-Autumn
Festival in Song Dynasty <sp> 10 </sp> is the identical activity in the <it>
Chung-yuan </it> for guiding the spirits of those who have been drowned. <sp>
11 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#57:1>
Furthermore , lantern carnivals in the Mid-Autumn Festival nowadays
are similar to the original activity Sheung-yuan. <sp> 12 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#58:1>
Ho &obrack;  211 &cbrack; points out that the reasons for these changes and
transformations are &ldquo; the gradual development of the temporal dimension
of the Chinese culture . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#59:1>
Chinese changed their lives from a totally agricultural society to a
mixed agricultural and commercial society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#60:1>
For the reason of <O> a table </O> the economic opening of China ,
value judgments , concepts and religious activities of foreign countries have
also accelerated the changes of the temporal layers of the lantern-culture of
Chinese . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#61:1>
<it> Lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival in Hong Kong </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#62:1>
The nature if living and the culture of Hong Kong was mainly
inherited from China , especially the southern region of China .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#63:1>
Before the Tang Dynasty , there were virtually no people living in
Hong Kong .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#64:1>
In the Ming Dynasty &obrack;  1368-1644 AD &cbrack; , fishermen hung lanterns on
boats for lighting only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#65:1>
In Qing Dynasty , fishermen started to hang lanterns around their
boats for decoration in the <it> Sheung-yuan </it> and the Mid-Autumn
Festival .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#66:1>
Same as the mainland China , originally lanterns for the Mid-Autumn
was nature and daily-life related .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#67:1>
Since acting as a colony of UK in the past hundred years , Hong Kong
got a chance to open herself to interact with foreign cultures and then build
up its distinctive culture . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#68:1>
Table 3 shows the difference of the outer level &obrack;  the 1st level)
of spatial dimension of the lantern-culture in Hong Kong between the several
decades ago and nowadays .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#69:1>
The comparison in Table 3 does not mean that object and events
appearing in the old days &obrack;  see the 2nd column &cbrack; do not exist nowadays &obrack;  see
the 3rd column &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#70:1>
It only provides an indication that people &lsquo; s attention of the
festival has been changed .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#71:1>
When looking at the lanterns of the festival , it is not difficult to
discover that original/traditional lanterns are rough and self-hand-made with
traditional techniques .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#72:1>
The images appearance and forms if these lanterns are localized in
style , while compared with the plastic <it> sailor-moon </it> image <sp> 13
</sp> &obrack;  a popular Japanese cartoon image &cbrack; of lanterns nowadays . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#73:1>
Since 1974 , district lantern carnivals have been introduced into
Hong Kong &obrack;  Urban Council , &ldquo; Lantern" &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#74:1>
The activities with the lanterns were changed from private and family
activities to public and community activities ,

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#75:1>
The role of lanterns in the Mid-Autumn Festival was also changed and
developed gradually from &ldquo; reinforcing the mood of the festival &rdquo;
to &ldquo; enriching the city lives and the mood of holidays and
entertainment . &rdquo;

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#76:1>
The festival is only a reason for people to have a holiday and enrich
their lives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#77:1>
Thus , people may not have family gatherings because of other
activities. <sp> 14 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#78:1>
This phenomenon is similar to what Tao has advocated that sacred
activities and customary directions &obrack;  see Figure 4 &cbrack; &obrack;  Tao &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#79:1>
The tendency of each direction is based on the nature and the
characteristics of the society .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#80:1>
For the lantern activities of the Mid-Autumn Festival in Hong Kong ,
the artistic direction is nearly co0vered by all of the others <O> A table
</O> though a small number of the Hong Kong people still want to keep
traditional customs of Chinese and intend to discover and maintain the
benefit of them . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#81:1>
<it> The Cultural Change </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#82:1>
In order to find the reasons for the change of lanterns in the
Mid-Autumn Festival , there are four basic areas which should be considered:
living standard , living environment , family nature and social change .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#83:1>
Actually , these areas are closely-related and affected by each Other
( see Figure 5 &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#84:1>
Without one of them , the situation may be totally different . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#85:1>
Among four basic areas , Ho &obrack;  4 &cbrack; points out that economic change
is the most significant factor which causes changes in concepts and value
judgment .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#86:1>
Consequently , it also affects how people make choices such as
materials , colors or images of an object or an event of their everyday lives .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#87:1>
While the living standard and the living environment are changing ,
the value judgment of Chinese in Hong Kong is also changing .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#88:1>
Nowadays , most of the people are living in floats instead of hoses .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#89:1>
Sometimes , it is very difficult for people to see the moon , and to
have places for worship , though some of the elder Chinese still want to
retain the custom of moon-worship .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#90:1>
On the other hand , it is also difficult for children to play with
lanterns outside the houses with neighbors as was <O> A figure </O> common
twenty years ago .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#91:1>
While the private spaces in private and public houses/flats are being
<it> increased </it> , the sharing and communication with neigbnors is being
<it> decreased </it> &obrack;  Fong &ampersand; Yeh &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#92:1>
In the old days , corridors and stairs are opened and well-
circulated with fresh air .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#93:1>
Adults and children liked to stay and play in these environments &obrack; 
Siu &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#94:1>
These kind of places seemed as stages or the &ldquo; Hyde Park
&rdquo; for people to express and perform themselves freely .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#95:1>
However , nowadays , air-conditioning houses/flats and
fire-protection doors separate people in different well-sealed <it> boxes
</it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#96:1>
Even though people meet at lift-lobbies or corridors , nodding head
or saying a &ldquo; hello &rdquo; seems difficult and redundant .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#97:1>
Thus , sharing and playing with lanterns together in the old days
seems to suddenly disappear in children &lsquo; s memory and experience .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#98:1>
Besides the living conditions and environments which affect the
lantern activities in the Mid-Autumn Festival , a shift in the roles between
family and school also causes changes .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#99:1>
Many of the traditional activities and parents &rsquo; duties are now
carried out by teachers .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#100:1>
Traditionally , family-union , moon-worship , myth-telling ,
lantern-making and playing are all the activities appearing in the home .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#101:1>
However , nowadays , most of these activities such as telling the
meaning of the festival and <it> practicing </it> <sp> 15 </sp> the lantern
activities are shifted to schools &obrack;  without the moon &obrack;  in the day-time &cbrack; ,
without family members and without the mood .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#102:1>
Teachers or child-care workers teaching children to make lanterns
are <O> A figure </O> the routine annual duties in the Mid-Autumn Festival.
<sp> 16 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#103:1>
But the nice shots of family activities - gathering and sharing -
seldom appear in the <it> home </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#104:1>
Furthermore , the change of the number , position , character ,
role and importance of family members causes a transformation in the
lantern-culture .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#105:1>
Since the 1960s , the government has educated people to have family
planning to minimize the number of children. <sp> 17 </sp>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#106:1>
Smaller number of children in a family raises the importance of
children .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#107:1>
The popularity of a nuclear family also enhances the significant and
importance status if children in a family . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2A-008#108:1>
In 1994 , 1996 and 1997 , interviews were conducted in a
traditional Chinese funeral paper-offering shop &obrack;  selling items for sacred
purposes &cbrack; before the Mid-Autumn Festivals .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#109:1>
Since the first interviews , Ah-Ying <sp> 18 </sp> remarked that the
number of children in a family affected her business .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#110:1>
She mentioned that in the old days , one family might only have one
lantern for several children and they enjoyed their lantern activities in the
outdoor .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#111:1>
Most of the tomes , children made lanterns by themselves &obrack;  or with
their parents &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#112:1>
Nowadays , while the living standard is rising , there might be more
than three lanterns for one child in a family , but the child might play or
hang up lanterns in the indoor environment only .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#113:1>
As stated before , children seldom go out to play with neighbors - -
<it> strangers </it> .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#114:1>
Parents always remind their children that they need to aware of the
strangers or misbehaviors of other children .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#115:1>
This phenomenon may reflect the importance of children nowadays or
the social relationship of our modern world .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#116:1>
As Harvey stated , people are self-protected and separated with <it>
violence </it> - the physical setting or the value judgment - - without
communication &obrack;  Harvey &cbrack; .

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#117:1>
While compared with the happy atmosphere of the harvest in the old
days , the meaning of the Mid-Autumn Festival &obrack;  Harvest Day &cbrack; - - celebration
, sharing and gathering - - is now totally distorted . </p>

<X>

<ICE-HK:W2A-008#X118:2>
As importance of children is increasing , materials involved in the
lantern activites also start to have differences . Besides &ldquo; boiling
wax"*** and playing lanterns with candles in parks by some children ,
electric bulbs and chemical lighting materials &obrack;  e.g. , florescent lighting
sticks &cbrack; are candle substitutes . As Ah-Ying mentioned , some lanterns only
has small bells inside it but without any lighting items . She wondered how
those plastic inflatable lanterns could create fun in the outdoor at night.
Lacking elderly in a nuclear family also accelerated the changes and the
formation of new layers of temporal dimension of culture &obrack;  Ho &cbrack; . Ah-Ying
pointed out that seldom young people liked to buy sacred materials &obrack;  papers
and paper models for the ancestor worship and offering &cbrack; from traditional
funeral paper-offering stores . Only fishermen , people living in walled city
( wei-tsuen &cbrack; and elder people buy paper lanterns or ask for them as gifts for
their children Young parents prefer to go to department stores or modern
shops to buy lanterns . Most of these lanterns are metal wire-famed ,
inflatable and made of plastic instead of papers and mit. Lacking an
inheritance of skills is another factor making lanterns change , Ah-Ying
stated that there were not so many traditional shops producing traditional
lanterns locally . The number of &ldquo; masters &rdquo; knowing how to make
traditional lanterns was becoming a countable number . Some of these masters
were too old to work and some changed their careers for getting better lives .
Actually , these masters tried to make paper lanterns with modern images and
shapes such as airplanes or tanks in the 1960s . However , that kind of
improvement and modification could not provide chances for them to survive .
Nowadays , most of the lanterns are produced in mainland China . For getting
the greatest effect with the lowest cost , using plastic materials with
minimum manual operations is the essential and effective strategy . Although
learning to make a tradi-tional lantern for the Mid-Autumn Festival is not a
very hard job &obrack;  beside some large paper lanterns for exhibition &cbrack; , it os a
time consuming and &ldquo; hopeless &rdquo; job for young people in Hong Kong .
Ah-Ying pointed out that her children did not want to learn her skills and
she also did not want them to inherit her business , too. Through
improvements in science and education , the significance of legends and
stories about the moon have diminished . Science and tech-nology also provide
more and wider communication channels so that dif-ferent concepts with
impacts of different cultures cause Hong Kong &lsquo; s local culture and
beliefs to change . From the religious and hierarchical changed to be more
artistic and customary . As stated in the promotion booklet of Lantern
Carnival 1976 &obrack;  Urban Council , &ldquo; Lantern" &cbrack; , public lantern activities
are used for improving the custom activities and tourism industry *** . While
more and morelantern festivals conducted in Hong Kong such as Zigong Chinese
Lantern Festival for the &ldquo; 1994 Regional Council Festival , &rdquo;
artistic and customary concepts of lantern activities in the Mid-Autumn
Festival are deeply impressed in Hong Kong people &lsquo; s minds . It also
creates an idea that lanterns are related to entertainment and carnivals only
, but not the concepts of nature-admiring or family-union. A Real
Understanding and Practice? Lanterns of Mid-Autumn Festival have developed
through about fif-teen hundred years of history . All of the changes in
lanterns , same as the Hong Kong cultures , are not caused by an individual
and isolated social factor or changed . They are caused by living standard ,
living environ-ment , family nature , and social change together . Although
it is very diffi-cult , or may not be a correct way to stop the changing of
lantern-culture as well as stopping the progression and the development of
our society , care should be taken as to what should be maintained or paid
more atten-tion to in cultural changes &obrack;  outer and intermediate levels of the
spatial dimension of culture &cbrack; it may not be the core part we should pay more
attention to , the area which should be considered is the rationale and
belief behind a change , and the effect of it &obrack;  inner level of spatial
dimension &cbrack; &obrack;  Ho &cbrack; . As torn-jeans and bar-code-tattoos may not only ve a
question of likes and dislikes , they may be the reflection of the feeling
and thinking if our teenages . In the same way , the change of the inner
level of spatial dimension of lantern-culture , as well as our cultures ,
are the areas we should pay more attention to nowadays. Today , parents in
Hong Kong may buy several lanterns for each of their children in the
Mid-Autumn Festival nowasays . However , it does not imply that all parents
consider it to be the core objectives of the festivals . When looking at this
routine behavior from the semiotic point of view - - the &ldquo; significant
&rdquo; of lanterns in the Mid-Autumn Festival , it is not difficult to
observe that parents seem to project their behaviors of buying lanterns as
fulfilling or getting all of the objectives froom the festival &obrack;  see Table
4a). Ah-Ying said that some people went to her paper shop to buy tradi-tional
lanterns every year . They were fishermen , old housewives and some who were
living in the Peak-Level - - a high living standard resi-dential area Hong
Kong . However , it does not imply all of these people understand and respect
the traditional core meanings of the Mid-Autumn Festival , though they follow
exactly what people did in the past . Actually , some of them may understand
and really want to achieve the goals of the festival , but many of these
people may not. Chamberlain points out the major reason for people
re-enacting tra-ditional sacred activities or events is a psychological
fulfillment &obrack;  Chamberlain &cbrack; . Most of them only perform/practice the visible
part of an activity &obrack;  outer and intermediate levels of the spatial dimension)
but neglect the core function and meaning of it . It is same as man &lsquo; s
deifica-tions of Kuan-Ti.*** People re-enacting a traditional or sacred
activity insis-tently without getting the spirit of it , is the same as the
practice of the triads and the police praying to same patron. When looking at
the police who insist on buying traditional lanterns through the semiotic
point of view , some of them may project their behaviors as being cultivated
Chinese by only fulfilling a small part of <O> Two tables </O> objectives of
the festival &obrack;  see Table 4b &cbrack; . In fact , this kind of behavior does not only
appear in the Mid-Autumn Festival . Every Mother &lsquo; s Day , carnations
are well sold and Chinese restaurants are full of people for drinking tea
with mothers . It is really a question whether it is a good son/daughter
while he/she only has tea with mother on that special day only . Moreover ,
in order to get seats on Mother &lsquo; s Day , people need to queue outside
restaurants and most of them are &ldquo; fathers &rdquo; and &ldquo; mothers
, &rdquo; while children are still asleep at home. Design of lanterns is also
progressing in a similar manner . Businessmen realize that shapes and the
materials for lanterns are not so critical as the existence of them . No
matter it is a sailor-moon image or just simply as a florescent stick , the
crucial point for a success in their business is an object which can be
called &ldquo; lantern &rdquo; and people can imag-ine themselves fulfilling
and getting the meaning of the festival through owning or buying this kind of
lanterns - - the sign of the festival. On the other hand , for suiting and
enriching everyday life , a lantern carnival in a district level was
introduced into Hong Kong in 1974 &obrack;  Tsim Sha Tsui Kaifong Welfare
Association &cbrack; . In order to invite more people to be involved in these social
activities , designers and promoters introduce and organize more , larger
carnivals in each year. As the culture of Hong Kong &obrack;  same as China-towns
coun-tries and urban areas in main-land China &cbrack; has been partially inherited
from China , and partially influenced by other cultures , people need to face
a very embarrassing situation that they want to maintain the tradi-tional
culture of Chinese but also want to march with foreign steps . In order to
confront this complicated and puzzling circumstances and to get a balance ,
people retain some selected substances , and tolerate and dis-card some which
are difficult to match with people &lsquo; s daily life . Every children to
have family unions in the Mid-Autumn Festal , Although the date for a supper
may have some adjustment or compromise. Generally , we cannot comment that
these product designs or activity arrangements are kitsch and useless for our
society . Howeverm as Hoshino(47 &cbrack; states that the &ldquo; connotation &rdquo;
of an item or an event in our society is the most valuable and meaningful
factor for us to concern . So , we should be careful that these depthnessless
&ldquo; nine day &lsquo; s wonder &rdquo; the original design or meaningless
routine activities may block our sensitivity , that we only concern ourselves
with the materials or the superficial fulfill-ment , but forget the original
concepts and meanings. Therefore , the lantern should be used as a bridge to
help Hong Kong people to get to the original objectives , but only the
superficial meanings of the Mid-Autumn Festival . On the one hand , materials
and images &obrack;  the outer and the intermediate levels of the spatial dimension
of the lantern-culture &cbrack; should reflect the Chinese characteristics . On the
other hand , we cannot omit the existence of social changes , So , the
con-tents of lanterns and activities should be matched with the lives of Hong
Kong people . This matching implies not only aiming at , market require-ment
, but also trying to remind people about the original objectives of the
festival. Actually , sailor-moon lanterns may be a good representation for us
to understand the culture identity in Hong Kong design , It mirrors market
orientated behavior and short-sighted market investment . It may also
reflect innovative mind of Hong Kong designers that they can substitute a
meaningless item or image into a product . However , what actions should be
done after the understanding ? Hong Kong is not an agricultural society
anymore , her culture is being developed under multiple-inheritance . All of
the subcultures are collaged together . It is extremely difficult for us to
arrive at a concrete and positive outcome and nobody has the right or power
to say which direction of design in Hong Kong is the best one for our
society/culture . Arguable , however , religious and hierarchical directions
of the Mid-Autumn Festival may seem to be the incorrect way . Thus ,
increasing the possibility for family union , appreciating nature and the
folk art must be clear goals of the fes-tival. To conclude , we should keep
in mind while designing or buying a lantern: to stimulate more creation but
nit only purchasing; to encourage group activity but not only individual
playing; and to support family sharing but not only social entertainment .
Obviously , these concepts may not only be associated with lanterns . They
may also be workable and beneficial for designing many of the objects and
activities for our modern world . </X>
