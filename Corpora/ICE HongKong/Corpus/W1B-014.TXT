Dear Carol ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#2:1>
Do you know who am I ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#3:1>
I am a very lovely girl that you met in the matriculation .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#4:1>
I  ' m <O> horizontal-line </O> .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#5:1>
I let you to guess it . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#6:1>
Actually , what are you going to do in the Christmas holidays ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#7:1>
I want to invite Rebecca , Catalina , Carol Law , Lee Fung , and Ah Po
to go outing .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#8:1>
Do you agree ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#9:1>
What are your advices ? </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#10:1>
Yesterday , I have gone to shopping with Rebecca .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#11:1>
Although I have gone to the spectacle shop to buy contact lenses but
I have not got the contact lenses yet .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#12:1>
Do you think that you cannot recognise me after I have used contact
lenses ? </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#13:1>
Tell me more about your recent situation for I can't find you
through phone and you always not call me after I have called you .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#14:1>
Do you think that you treat me badly ? </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#15:1>
Oh !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#16:1>
It  ' s time to have my dinner .

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#22:2>
Have you received my mail ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#23:2>
I can not receive your mail .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#24:2>
I think you mailed the wrong address .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#25:2>
It should be mk_carol@ustuxmail.usthk.hk or mk_carol@ustsu3.usthk.hk
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#26:2>
You may try again later .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#27:2>

Dear Connie ,

I don't know why but I really can't receive your mail .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#32:3>
Have you mailed the wrong address ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#33:3>
It should be mk_carol@ustuxmail.usthk.hk or mk_carol@ustsu3.usthk.hk .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#34:3>
So you may try again . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#35:3>
I know you found the E-mail and talk service very facinating ,
but don't forget other things like your studywork .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#36:3>
If you really know how to use the E-mail next time , tell me more
about your life in HKU , okay ? </p>

Dear Carol ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#41:4>
Hello , I have received your message already .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#42:4>

I will go to the ball of the social work society which will held on
27th Dec , 1992 .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#47:4>
Also , I will go to the ball of the Tuen Mun Technical Institute .
 </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#48:4>
Actually , I don't want to go now because I don't know how to
dance .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#49:4>
Beside , I  ' m afraid that nobody will ask me to dance .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#50:4>
However , I can't do this because I have promise Sin Yee and my
hallmates .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#51:4>
Hey , don't talk about it !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#52:4>
Just forget it . </p>

Dear Connie ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#82:7>
Now I still can't received <-> anyone </->  <+> any one </+> of
your mails !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#83:7>

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#87:8>
Dear Carol ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#88:8>
Have you received my mail ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#89:8>
Actually , I will not try again if this time I can not sent mail to
you .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#90:8>
The reason is that I  ' m very frustrating for the several failure in
sending mail .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#91:8>
Now , I have suddenly lost the interest in talking with other ,
except the people overseas .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#92:8>
It is because I can learn more foreign things such as culture by
talking with the foreigners or Chinese students <-> aborad </->  <+> abroad
 </+> .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#93:8>
What is your feeling in talking with other by using mail ? </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#94:8>
Have I told you that I bought contact lenses few weeks before ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#95:8>
Actually , I seldom wear them because I prefer to wear glasses more
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#96:8>
&obrack; I think I am more suitable in wearing glasses &cbrack; 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#97:8>
Do you want to see me when I am wearing contact lenses ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#98:8>
If you want I will wear them next time when we go out together . </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#99:8>
That  ' s all I want to say in this moment .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#100:8>
I will sent mail to you next time.
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#101:8>

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#106:9>
Why don't you send an e-mail to me ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#107:9>

disappointed.

I  ' m so glad to receive your mail on 24/2/93 and I  ' m trying my
best to sent mail to you .

I hope you can receive my mail this time . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#112:10>
Actually , we have not seen each other for several weeks , how
are you ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#113:10>
I hope your life will be full of happiness .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#114:10>
Let  ' s tell you my recent situation , OK ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#115:10>
Actually , I  ' m not quite happy recently .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#116:10>
The reason is that I think the school life is bored and I want to
go to the country-side to relax .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#117:10>
Could you join me ? </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#118:10>
I hope you can.

Oh , are you really so boring ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#125:11>
What is your daily life everyday ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#126:11>
I hope that I can have a talk with you as soon as possible .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#127:11>
Maybe This Saturday will be a good chance .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#128:11>
I miss you so much ! </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#129:11>
Actually I am very very busy those few days as we are preparing
for the election of the Marketing Students Society .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#130:11>
But I still want to steal some time and see you . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#131:11>
Hing is now beside me ,
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#132:11>
he would like to say something :
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#133:11>
Hello , I am Vincent !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#134:11>
Carol always mentioned you .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#135:11>
So I  ' m looking forward to meet you in the future and make friends
with you ,
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#136:11>
see you later ! </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#137:11>
Now I need to do something for the Wings ,
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#138:11>
talk to you next time
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#139:11>
Carol </I> 

 <I> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#140:12>
Dear Connie ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#141:12>
I  ' m so happy to tell you that we have been succeeded in the
election of the Marketing Society Exco yesterday !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#142:12>
Although I  ' m not so satisfied with the &percent; of voting
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#143:12>
&obrack; less than 60&percent; Marketing Students vote &cbrack; ,
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#144:12>
at least we can really put our year plan on progress and settle
down .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#145:12>
I just hope that I won't be so busy later . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#146:12>
I feel that I  ' m really a sleepy lazy bone !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#147:12>
I must have an 8-hour sleep <-> everyday </->  <+> every day </+> !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#148:12>
That  ' s why I  ' ve been so so tired those two weeks due to lack of
sleeping .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#149:12>
Nevertheless , I will try to steal more time to sleep in the coming
future . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#150:12>
We  ' ve taken many photos during the election day
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#151:12>
&obrack; we are all formal dressing &cbrack; .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#152:12>
I can give some photos to you later and you would find it very
funny &obrack; I  ' m sure &cbrack;  </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#153:12>
Ok , talk to you next time !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#154:12>
Carol </I> 

 <I> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#155:13>
My dearest Connie ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#156:13>
Why don't you read my mail ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#157:13>
I  ' m looking forward to read your mail <-> everyday </->  <+> every
day </+> but every time it makes me disappointed !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#158:13>
I hope that it won't be any trouble for you to read my mail once a
week ! ! ! </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#159:13>
I  ' ve not seen you for some time .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#160:13>
How are you getting on ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#161:13>
I of course are very busy still these days but the condition is not
too bad .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#162:13>
&obrack; you see at least I still have time to send you mail !
 &cbrack; 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#163:13>
But the mid-term exam is already coming in this late March ! ! !
&obrack; so sad &cbrack; 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#164:13>
But I still haven't read any pages of Account !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#165:13>
God , please help me !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#166:13>
I  ' m dying ! ! ! </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#167:13>
Talk to you next time
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#168:13>
Carol

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#169:13>
P.S.
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#170:13>
I really hope to fix a time for us to talk with each other directly
through the talk service of computers ,
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#171:13>
do you want to try ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#172:13>
Mail to me next time and answer me .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#173:13>
I would check mail several times a week ! </p>  </I> 

 <I> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#174:14>
Dear Carol ,

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#175:14>
I  ' ve read your mail already .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#176:14>
First of all , I want to congratulate on your succeed in the
election , also , don't forget to congratulate Tracy and Hing for me please !
 </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#177:14>
Actually , I am busy with my studies and the function held by
our hall .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#178:14>
This Tuesday , we hold a function which was in charge by me .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#179:14>
The participation rate of the function is quiet low but those who
have participated found that it  ' s <-> quiet </->  <+> quite </+> happy .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#180:14>
So , although I  ' m not <-> quiet </->  <+> quite </+> happy with the
participation rate , I  ' d like to thank for the other Exco members and those
who have participated in the function . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#181:14>
Indeed , I seldom go to the computer centre except I have to do
my homework .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#182:14>
So , it  ' s quite difficult for us to organise a suitable time to
talk with each other through unix system .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#183:14>
But , if you want to talk with me by this method , it  ' s not
impossible .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#184:14>
Usually , I have much leisure time on Wednesday .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#185:14>
So , if you are not busy with your work at that time , you can
arrange a time for us , OK ? </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#186:14>
Talk to you next time !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#187:14>
Connie
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#188:14>
P.S.
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#189:14>
Do you notice that I have typed &lsquo; <mention> quite </mention> 
&rsquo; for &lsquo; <mention> quiet </mention> &rsquo; several times .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#190:14>
I  ' m sorry that I have made such a minor mistake and I hope you can
understand what I  ' m saying in the letter .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#191:14>
&obrack; actually , I  ' m very tired now &cbrack;

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#194:15>
Dear Connie

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#195:15>
What are you doing now ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#196:15>
I don't know whether you have finished your summer time when you
read this mail .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#197:15>
In fact , I find this summer too boring esp. I still can't find a
summer job now .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#198:15>
I really don't want to tell lies but I really find it difficult to
find a job .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#199:15>
Perhaps people always like to treat honest people <-> cruely </-> 
 <+> cruelly </+> ! </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#200:15>
Nevertheless , I still think that a long holiday without job
may not be something too bad as I can have more time to rest , relax , or do
other things . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#201:15>
How about you ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#202:15>
Have you make good use of this holiday ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#203:15>
I hope you have .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#204:15>

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#210:16> I am preparing for the Camp Book work .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#211:16> It is a hard job for me to attend the SU meeting tonight because no
one of us is available that time .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#212:16> Poor Carol !

<ICE-HK:W1B-014#220:17> Don't tell me that you have assignment , projects , tests and exam
to finish , &obrack; cos I have them too ! &cbrack; ok ?

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#221:17> Frustration , frustration .................
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#222:17> I am really frustrated by the huge huge workload that I have facing
now .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#223:17> Yesterday night I got to finish 3 project/case analysis !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#224:17> I do until nearly 3:00am .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#225:17> That  ' s the latest time I sleep recently .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#226:17> Then I got 3 project meetings to be held today , rushing again at
the morning to campus ........... woo wooo wooooo !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#227:17> Don't know why I have to be so poor . </p> 

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#228:17> Please tell me something about you !
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#229:17> Though I meet you periodically , I still found that something
seemed to be missing at our conversation .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#230:17> Friendship is really a valuable thing to people of our age &semi;
at least to me .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#231:17> After our graduation , we may have involved in another busy work
life again .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#232:17> Meeting would be much more difficult thing .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#233:17> Can we still maintain the same level of contact ? </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#234:17> May be if we insist on . &obrack; 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#235:17> See ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#236:17> Only old woman would say such things ! &cbrack; 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#237:17> That  ' s all boring enough !

 <p>  
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#238:17> Have you applied any job ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#239:17> I have decided to apply my first job now .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#240:17> But I got to finish writing my application letter and resume first !
 </p> 
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#241:17> That  ' s all &obrack; as some <-> troube </->  <+> trouble </+> 
person is trying to watch this ! &cbrack;

 <p>

we have got so little time to talk .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#246:18> I think it doesn't matter at all cos  '  I still remember you still
 <-> own </->  <+> owe </+> me a lunch .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#247:18> I believe it will be much better to meet and talk in detail during
lunch .
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#248:18>  <-> Nonethless </->  <+> Nonetheless </+> , I don't think we have
any chances cos you are so busy and I don't think I have any time to date you
right ?
 
<ICE-HK:W1B-014#249:18> Just call me when you  ' ve got time and I will appreciate to come .

ask me for lunch .
