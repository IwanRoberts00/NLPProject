<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#20:3>
We refer to our telephone conversation regarding the captioned on
3.5.94 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#21:3>
We are pleased to advise that the calculation of the premium rate
for both Building &ampersand; Contents is square meter &times; USD1.2 traditionally .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#22:3>
However , we converted the method of rating to 0.065&percent; and it
was agreed by our head office on 22.12.93 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#23:3>
Nevertheless , according to the record , our Cathy Li suggested
that we would charge 0.065&percent; at renewal .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#24:3>
Therefore , we would charge 0.065&percent; plus 10&percent; increase
for premium rate at renewal as per our fax dated 8.4.94 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#25:3>
We enclose herewith copies of fax dated 12.11.93 , 22.3.94
&ampersand; 8.4.94 for your easy reference . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#26:3>
Thus , we would like to charge 0.0715&percent; as a renewal rate .
</p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#27:3>
Breakdown of the Renewal Premium :

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#28:3>
Building HK&dollar;50,000,000 &times; 0.0715&percent; = HK&dollar;35,750.00

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#29:3>
Contents HK&dollar;16,700,000 &times; 0.0715&percent; = HK&dollar;11,940.00

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#30:3>
Stock HK&dollar;364,700,000 &times; 0.0715&percent; &times; 75&percent; =
HK&dollar;195,570.00

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#31:3>
Total Premium : HK&dollar;243,260.00

<ul> Re : Letter of Complaint </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#118:7>
Thank you for your inquiry regarding the above .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#119:7>
The patient concerned was admitted on November 4 , 1994 and was
discharged on November 27 , 1994 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#120:7>
The patient was first admitted with stomatitis , dehydration ,
mouth sores , lack of appetite and disseminated intravascular coagulation .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#121:7>
We did not receive any complaints about the bed sores upon admission .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#122:7>
After the first two days of admission , Mr. <O> name </O>  ' s
condition deteriorated rapidly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#123:7>
Mr. <O> name </O> was suffering from shortness of breath , low
blood pressure , and was experiencing acute renal failure .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#124:7>
He required oxygen and was on I.V. drip .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#125:7>
He was subsequently put on dialysis . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#126:7>
We were aware that Mr. <O> name </O>  ' s body functions were
extremely vulnerable to developing bed sores among many other medical
problems .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#127:7>
While keeping an eye on <O> name </O>  ' s overall condition , our
nursing staff were giving him other urgent care and attention with utmost
priority . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#128:7>
We first noticed <O> name </O> developed a <-> redened </-> <+>
reddened </+> area on the early morning of November 7 , 1994 , the same day
we transferred him to I.C.U .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#129:7>
The patient  ' s record showed that the I.C.U. nurses took meticulous
steps to treat the area by turning him in different positions and applying
special dressing on the affected area .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#130:7>
Unfortunately , despite our effort , the skin continued to
deteriorate due to the poor state of circulation and the patient  ' s fragile
state of health . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#131:7>
We feel very sympathetic toward <O> name </O>  ' s suffering .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#132:7>
At the same time we are also delighted to see his recovery from such
a major illness .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#133:7>
As always , Adventist Hospital is very willing to listen to our
patient  ' s concerns and we will be glad to share our findings with the
patient himself and his daughter directly upon their request . </p>

Hong Kong Dear Mr. <O> name </O> ,

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#142:8>
Thank you for your phone call yesterday .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#143:8>
I hope you are feeling better today . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#144:8>
I have checked with our physical therapist regarding the charges .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#145:8>
We recognized that you did not wish to pay for the therapy because
after your consultation with <O> name </O> it was found unnecessary . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#146:8>
Our physical therapists normally check with our patients to see
if they have been seen by one of our doctors and whether a verbal or written
referral is established .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#147:8>
Our physical therapist remembered you mentioned <O> name </O> saw
you couple of days ago and indicated physiotherapy treatment .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#148:8>
It was on this basis we carried out the treatment .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#149:8>
Looking back , it would not be wise to delay your physical therapy
treatment pending on the outcome of your consultation with <O> name </O>

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#150:8>
As such a move may affect your recovery and we may now be having a
different conversation . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#151:8>
We appreciate you letting us know about your concern .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#152:8>
We hope you would let us serve you again .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#153:8>
Our cashier will send you the balance of the bill . </p>

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#154:8>
Thank you again for taking the time to bring this matter to our
attention .

Dear Ms. <O> name </O>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#168:9>
We are grateful for your letter regarding Mr. <O> name </O>  ' s
experience .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#169:9>
We regret the equipment was not functioning properly at the time of
the procedure .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#170:9>
The malfunction instrument has been replaced since then . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#171:9>
The &ldquo; Snare Biopsy Forcep &rdquo; which Mr. <O> name </O>  ' s
doctor used to remove the polyp is a delicate instrument .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#172:9>
This is the first time we have had trouble with it .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#173:9>
An attempt was made to remove Mr. <O> name </O>  ' s polyp with an
alternative instrument and only a small part of the polyp was removed .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#174:9>
We had no choice but to invite Mr. <O> name </O> to come back
another time . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#175:9>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#176:9>
On June 16th , during the second attempt to remove Mr. <O> name
</O>  ' s polyp , our colonscope was blocked due to the patient  ' s faeces .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#177:9>
The instrument must be taken out to be unblocked and cleared before
it can be used . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#178:9>
Regarding why the polyp was not found , we learned that after
the procedure the patient told Dr. <O> name </O> he has passed the polyp that
morning .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#179:9>
The doctor should have been told prior to the procedure and he would
then be able to evaluate whether it was necessary to proceed with the
colonoscopy . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#180:9>
We normally explain to each patient the charges prior to
services .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#181:9>
Our receptionist remembered Mr. <O> name </O> was first booked as a
third class patient by Dr. <O> name </O>  ' s clinical staff .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#182:9>
However , on the day Mr. <O> name </O> was admitted he requested 1st
class .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#183:9>
To be respectful to our patient  ' s wishes we refrained from forcing
our patient to choose third class .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#184:9>
This would be insulting especially after we have just explained to
Mr. <O> name </O> the charges for each class . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#185:9>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#186:9>
We believe <O> name </O> should have been charged once for the
procedure rather than twice .

<ICE-HK:W1B-028#187:9>
On behalf of the hospital We will arrange for the second hospital
procedure charges to be <-> waved </-> <+> waived </+> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1B-028#188:9>
Thank you very much for bringing this matter to our attention so
we can improve our services . </p>
