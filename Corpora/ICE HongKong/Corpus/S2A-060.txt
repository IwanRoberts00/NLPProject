<I>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#1:1> <&> Beginning of the demonstration partially not recorded </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-060#2:1:A>
First one that we have a database called Hong Kong University

And a second way of doing finding Hong Kong U thesis that you can
use the Hong Kong U catalogue the Dragon to do <unc> two words </unc>
start our limit in order to find the thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#11:1:A>
There  ' s two way of doing it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#12:1:A>
And then later we  ' ll talk about the thesis databases

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#13:1:A>
There  ' re two of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#14:1:A>
One is called ProQuest digital dissertations that they claim that
is a international database that cover all areas including Hong Kong okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#15:1:A>
But actually uhm the main theme is uh from United States and also
Canada okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#16:1:A>
And the next one that I will show you is Index to Thesis with
Abstracts Accepted by Higher Degrees by the University of Great Britain and
Ireland

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#17:1:A>
So this one is more specific unlike the first one okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#18:1:A>
So far any question

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#19:1:A>
No okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#20:1:A>
Now Hong Kong U thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#21:1:A>
Hong Kong U University Thesis Online that we can access

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#22:1:A>
How can we access it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#23:1:A>
The first one you can access it from our homepage okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#24:1:A>
I  ' ll show it to you <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#25:1:A>
You can have your hands on too if you want to

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#26:1:A>
And go to our homepage

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#27:1:A>
This is our homepage

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#28:1:A>
And then you go to Hong Kong UL Digital Initiatives here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#29:1:A>
You click here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#30:1:A>
And then there are so many databases which are created by
University Hong Kong or Hong Kong libraries

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#31:1:A>
And one of them is called Hong Kong University Thesis Online okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#32:1:A>
So you just click this in Hong Kong University Online okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#33:1:A>
So this is uh description telling you what is inside here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#34:1:A>
Because uhm the thesis are from different departments so the
beginning date are various

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#35:1:A>
So if you want to uhm see uhm the beginning date ex cetera you can
go through the description here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#36:1:A>
And you can have the whole thing about the database about the
collection

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#37:1:A>
How many are inside there

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#38:1:A>
And how can you access from it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#39:1:A>
And there  ' s the description to it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#40:1:A>
So you just click here okay in this button

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#41:1:A>
And then you will go to this one

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#42:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#43:1:A>
To this page

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#44:1:A>
Now there  ' re several ways of finding the university of uhm thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#45:1:A>
You can either search that means you can just key in certain
keyword here and then you can do the search from here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#46:1:A>
For putting the keyword here there  ' re several way for you to do
this

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#47:1:A>
Searching

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#48:1:A>
You can put the keyword as anywhere okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#49:1:A>
You type in the keyword and then it may appear anywhere of the
record

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#50:1:A>
The keyword as part of the title okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#51:1:A>
The keyword as the author  ' s name

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#52:1:A>
The keyword as the subject

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#53:1:A>
So these are choice for you okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#54:1:A>
There are four choices for you

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#55:1:A>
You can use it and type it in any of the keyword and then select
your own choice

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#56:1:A>
It means anywhere that means uh you will get more citations more
dissertations but it may not be at as relevant as that you will use it as the
keyword as title or the keyword as the subject

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#57:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#58:1:A>
So it  ' s all up to you or what you want to do okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#59:1:A>
Now let  ' s one want to uh find something on quality education okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#60:1:A>
So I just type it in <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#61:1:A>
Now I type the keyword quality education because I don't know how
many will be there for quality education okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#62:1:A>
So I just type this in and do a search okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#63:1:A>
If I do a search like this <,,> they will give me three records
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#64:1:A>
Three records of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#65:1:A>
And the first one that is a lady  ' s name Leung Pui Ling okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#66:1:A>
And the title is achieving <.> ed </.> uhm quality education

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#67:1:A>
And we have two copies within the library

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#68:1:A>
The first one is in Education Library

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#69:1:A>
The second one is in Special Educations

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#70:1:A>
Most of our thesis are in Special Collections

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#71:1:A>
And all of them they cannot be checked out

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#72:1:A>
You must use it within the library itself okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#73:1:A>
Now down below here that you will see that the publishing year is
two thousand and one

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#74:1:A>
And the language is in English

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#75:1:A>
How thick is the thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#76:1:A>
It  ' s one hundred and seven leaves okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#77:1:A>
It  ' s not that thick

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#78:1:A>
It  ' s like that

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#79:1:A>
And also the department of this thesis is Education

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#80:1:A>
And this is our higher degree thesis because we only keep higher
degree <?> theses </?> within the university library

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#81:1:A>
So the degree is Master of Education okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#82:1:A>
And also there are subjects for it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#83:1:A>
High schools principals China Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#84:1:A>
And from the subject you will see you will know that what is about
in the thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#85:1:A>
For example total quality management in education China Hong Kong
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#86:1:A>
This is the subject of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#87:1:A>
And down below here there  ' s also Hong Kong subject

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#88:1:A>
That Library of Congress subject headings are those that created uh
from our Library of Congress subject heading that means it  ' s from United
States subject heading

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#89:1:A>
They they have a whole list of subject headings and then we go
through the thesis and we find out this subjects are more appropriate so we
just select it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#90:1:A>
But in Hong Kong Collection that they also give Hong Kong subject
because uhm in Hong Kong we don't put down China Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#91:1:A>
We just give the subject because everything inside in Special
Collection most of them are about Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#92:1:A>
So we just put under <.> Chi </.> uh secondary school principals

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#93:1:A>
And then you understood that Hong Kong is the heading of it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#94:1:A>
So that means the subject heading is secondary school principals
but in Hong Kong okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#95:1:A>
So in uh the <.> Ho </.> uh Hong Kong subject there  ' s no Hong Kong
there but is understood that is about Hong Kong

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#96:1:A>
And also here that you will see the table of content

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#97:1:A>
Oops

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#98:1:A>
Don't know what  ' s wrong

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#99:1:A>
Suppose you can see the table of <.> con </.> oh I I  ' ve I had
actually asked my colleague to fix it already

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#100:1:A>
If you click the table of contents

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#101:1:A>
The PDF you will see the table of content and also the abstract

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#102:1:A>
Uh just excuse me uh let me uh asked them to redo it again <&> a
pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#103:1:A>
Let  ' s redo it again <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#104:1:A>
Now okay this time that <O> Cantonese speeches , confirming the
programme fixed </O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#105:1:A>
Now let  ' s redo it again because something wrong with it and my
colleague has just fixed it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#106:1:A>
Now you will see that there  ' s the table of content okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#107:1:A>
And there is only one page because is only the table of content

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#108:1:A>
Okay that  ' s all

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#109:1:A>
And also you can see also the abstract the summary of them okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#110:1:A>
The summary of the database uh of uh this particular thesis okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#111:1:A>
So this is no full text yet

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#112:1:A>
Everybody can get it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#113:1:A>
No <O> unidentified speeches </O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#114:1:A>
So this is the way for you to search uhm by keyword

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#115:1:A>
And also here that you also can limit by title

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#116:1:A>
For example if you want uh quality education as part of the title
and then you can click to it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#117:1:A>
But I  ' m afraid there might not have anything so I just uhm use
quality

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#118:1:A>
For example I use title <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#119:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#120:1:A>
Now just like this one that we will find quality as part of the
title okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#121:1:A>
And the second one quality as part of the title

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#122:1:A>
So now limit quality that word must appear in the title okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#123:1:A>
If you want it as part of the subject quality the word quality as
in the subject <,,> so you see here that is quality as part of the title

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#124:1:A>
So it  ' s of your own choice that you can select the keyword as
part of anywhere or that word appear in title or that word in the subject or
you can select author

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#125:1:A>
For example the author  ' s name is <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#126:1:A>
I put down Chan there

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#127:1:A>
And now the computer will select every author  ' s last name is Chan
for me <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#128:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#129:1:A>
And then you just check

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#130:1:A>
All this title the author  ' s name is Chan okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#131:1:A>
Okay all right

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#132:1:A>
Up till now that you can search some keyword search yourself and
to see if you can find some title before we go on to do our limit search by
date by programme degree language ex cetera

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#133:1:A>
I give you three minutes and then you can test a keyword and you
will find some citation yourself

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#134:1:A>
If you have any question you just raise your hand <&> a long
pause, tape stops and restarts </&>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#135:1:A>
By using it as a keyword and also uh if we have too many citation
for example if I just put it China there I might find a lot of titles

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#136:1:A>
Too many of them okay <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#137:1:A>
If you find too manys uh thesis on this particular subject or you
might want to limit it for a certain period of time

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#138:1:A>
I only want the recent uhm citation but I don't want the old one
okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#139:1:A>
We have too many

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#140:1:A>
Now just like this

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#141:1:A>
I find <,> <.> fif </.> uh five thousand three hundred and thirty
three citations with the word China there okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#142:1:A>
There  ' re too many of it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#143:1:A>
So I might use it to narrow it down to only find those <.> s </.>
thesis published after nineteen ninety to two thousand and three okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#144:1:A>
Or I might also limit it with a degree

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#145:1:A>
For example I just want MA not others okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#146:1:A>
Or I only want language English

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#147:1:A>
So there  ' s also choice for you to do the limit okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#148:1:A>
It  ' s all up to you

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#149:1:A>
Now from five thousand something now I limit it to the MA degree
and I only can find one hundred and fifty of it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#150:1:A>
So this is uh one of the way for you to narrow it down okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#151:1:A>
So you can try to limit it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#152:1:A>
Give you some time to do a try

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#153:1:A>
You can type your own topic and <.> s </.> try to search if you
can find some thesis okay <O> unidentified conversations in Cantonese , a
long pause </O>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#154:1:A>
Now this one is uhm using the keyword search okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#155:1:A>
Now you might also not using a keyword search but you just want to
browse around to see the department to see how many thesis in that particular
department you just want

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#156:1:A>
For example I want anatomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#157:1:A>
I <.> d </.> I I don't know uh what keyword

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#158:1:A>
I don't have any idea what I  ' m going to write my thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#159:1:A>
I just want to get some idea from the old thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#160:1:A>
So you might browse around and then you just click there and you
select all and then you search

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#161:1:A>
Now this time instead of giving you the keyword because I haven't
typed in the keyword but instead I type in the department so now give you all
the thesis from anatomy okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#162:1:A>
So there  ' re how many <,> of them

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#163:1:A>
Total fifty seven are from anatomy okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#164:1:A>
So you can do in this way <,> by browsing uh by department by the
programme or you can also click here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#165:1:A>
Here is browse by department of programme you click here and then
you select anatomy

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#166:1:A>
I don't know why this figure is more this time

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#167:1:A>
Something wrong okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#168:1:A>
You can do either way actually

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#169:1:A>
Now uh I will uh tell you later on

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#170:1:A>
Now just like this one

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#171:1:A>
There  ' s no full text here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#172:1:A>
But I will show you the other one is has full text later

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#173:1:A>
If there  ' s a full text like uhm <,> uh one guy has uhm go into it
and there  ' s a full text

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#174:1:A>
For example just like this one <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#175:1:A>
This one has full text

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#176:1:A>
Full text body okay and then you can click into here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#177:1:A>
Yes if there  ' s no icon

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#178:1:A>
I tell you

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#179:1:A>
Just like this one there  ' re the full text is there

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#180:1:A>
Two hundred and seventy two pages

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#181:1:A>
And then you can go for it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#182:1:A>
But as I told you before this databases this database we do not
have all of those uh entries have full text

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#183:1:A>
We only just have couple of them have full text because we just
start to have the full text since last year okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#184:1:A>
So if you don't have the full text you can either use the title or
use the author  ' s name into our Dragon our catalogue

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#185:1:A>
For example this one <,> okay and then you copy and paste

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#186:1:A>
You go to our Dragon catalogue <,,> go back here and then use
title and then I paste the title again and then I type

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#187:1:A>
So there  ' s thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#188:1:A>
Here for you to view the uh electronic thesis and here  ' s the hard
copy and give you this number

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#189:1:A>
The location is is Special Collections

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#190:1:A>
The status is available okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#191:1:A>
So here if there  ' s no full text online and then you have to go
back to our catalogue and check the call number for it

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#192:1:A>
Actually there  ' s a call number there

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#193:1:A>
You just can get the call number and go upstairs

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#194:1:A>
Go upstairs and uhm to uhm our Special Collections okay <O> An
inaudible question </O> No you have to use it within the library

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#195:1:A>
All the thesis cannot be check out except those thesis are not
from Hong Kong U from other <.> li </.> uh from other university then you can
borrow it okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#196:1:A>
But I will talk about it alter on okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#197:1:A>
Anything unclear for uhm browse by department and also you can
browse by degree okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#198:1:A>
For example Master of Arts in Education then you can browse around
with this uh thesis

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#199:1:A>
That  ' s the call number here

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#200:1:A>
Okay anything unclear so far

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#201:1:A>
<O> An inaudible question </O> Uhm is it all depends on the author
you know uh when they gave us the thesis and then we asked them to sign a
page and then we  ' ll paste it at the back

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#202:1:A>
If they allow if the uh author mark it that allow xeroxing and
then we will let the user to do some xeroxing but of course is governed by
copyright law okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#203:1:A>
The law of copyright okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#204:1:A>
So it all depends on the author

<ICE-HK:S2A-060#205:1:A>
Some of them they even don't let other people to read it within
three years <,> within two years or never want anybody to read his <.> the
</.> he his or her thesis okay </I>
