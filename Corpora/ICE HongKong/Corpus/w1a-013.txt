&ldquo; Assessment , as we conceive it , consists in a systematic
process of analysis and Synthesis &rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#3:1>
With reference to this statement , several points need to pay
attention , i.e. the tri-foci model of assessment is a systematic process
&semi; it consists of analysis of several areas; and it is a synthesis of the
data generated from the analysis . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#4:1>
Tri-foci model is a systematic process of assessment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#5:1>
Such systematic process is useful to social workers because it
provides directions for social workers to follow , both in direction and
content .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#6:1>
Although it does not point out the ways to intervention , it provides
us with a correct direction .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#7:1>
In the first sense , tri-foci model provides us the content for
analysis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#8:1>
As the name implies , it consists of three areas for assessment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#9:1>
The first one id the demand of life tasks .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#10:1>
Such life tasks may <-> dervie </-> <+> derive </+> from the
maturation process of individual e.g. the transition from adult to elderly .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#11:1>
It may stem from transition/demand of external systems .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#12:1>
Such demands cause burden to individuals .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#13:1>
Also this can also be generalized to demands other than the demands
from life tasks , e.g. stress caused by psychological factors , <del> e.g.
</del> like fear . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#14:1>
The second foci is the natural system e.g. family .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#15:1>
The third foci is the societal system e.g. formal organizations like
school , work place .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#16:1>
So the tri-foci model provides us the content of assessment , without
considering such foci assessment is incomplete . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#17:1>
Another than pointing the content of assessment , it also
provides us the steps &obrack; phasic &cbrack; in doing assessment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#18:1>
The first step is the collection of data from the three foci .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#19:1>
After gathering such data , together with knowledge acquired by
social workers , some hypothesis are generated .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#20:1>
Further data are collected in order to proved or nullify the
hypothesis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#21:1>
This is the process of analysing data .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#22:1>
If the hypothesis is proved to be correct match the reality , then
the next step is the assessment of the situation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#23:1>
So the tri-foci model s useful to social workers because it is a
systematic process as measured by its content and its procedures .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#24:1>
It must lie point out that such model can extend to nearly all social
worker intervention methods by extending the concepts . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#25:1>
It is also useful because the model is embedded in a large
process of the helping process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#26:1>
In the generalist approach of social work , intervention can be
broadly classified into three phases namely &obrack; 1 &cbrack; the beginning
phase - emphasis on engagement of client , preliminary contract formulation ,
collection of data &obrack; 2 &cbrack; the middle phase - the action phase -
including assessment , goal formulation and actions &obrack; 3 &cbrack;
ending phase - for termination and evaluation .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#27:1>
In this process model , assessment plays an important part .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#28:1>
If no accurate assessment can be formulated , no desirable
changes/interventions are possible .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#29:1>
The tri-foci model provides a frame-work for assessment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#30:1>
Its usefulness fall within its comprehensiveness of assessment . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#31:1>
As seen from the above , I can see that the tri-foci model
provides a systematic process of analysis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#32:1>
It is also a systematic process of synthesis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#33:1>
Synthesis means the assessment of data collected .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#34:1>
In the process of assessment people needs to formulate hypothesis
generated from data collected &ampersand; the workers  '  knowledge .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#35:1>
Such process is indeed a process of synthesis: synthesis of data
&ampersand; knowledge .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#36:1>
In Marxist term synthesis is important in <-> dilactic </-> <+> <?>
dialectic </?> </+> .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#37:1>
Synthesis means the combination of thesis and anti-thesis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#38:1>
Such combination is not a mixture of thesis &ampersand; anti-thesis .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#39:1>
It is a new one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#40:1>
Thus in the process of assessment , different data collected may
contradict with each other &obrack; this is often the case especially found
in family cases &cbrack; Thus synthesis is important as it give workers a new
perspective . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#41:1>
The model is useful because it can point out the intervention
approach .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#42:1>
For example if the assessment found that the problem lies within the
individual , then case work or group work approach will be appropriate .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#43:1>
If the problem lies in the natural system e.g. family , then family
therapy is recommended .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#44:1>
If the problem lies in the societal organization , community work is
recommended . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#45:1>
As a conclusion , tri-foci model gives us a direction and a
comprehensive way of assessment .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#46:1>
Such assessment is the base of future intervention .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#47:1>
It is the foundation of social practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#48:1>
If social worker tries to solve problem , we must know what is the
problem . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#50:1>
In promoting organization change from within organization is
quite difficult especially if the change is initiated from below i.e. low
rank staff .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#51:1>
Patti and other social worker practitioners , like Frey , have
proposed different frameworks to assess the resistance of change in an
organization .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#52:1>
Generally speaking , resistances to change include the following
factors:

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#53:1>
1.

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#54:1>
The nature of change

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#55:1>
2. Value orientations of decision makers

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#56:1>
3. Organizational Distance &dash; the change agent  ' s distance with
decision makers

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#57:1>
4. Sunk cost &dash; efforts invest by the organization

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#58:1>
5. Organizational History towards change

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#59:1>
6. Cultural Background </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#60:1>
To me , the first two factors are important in the analysis of
resistance to change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#61:1>
Change here mean any modification/deletion of procedures , goals ,
objectives , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#62:1>
I further assume that the change agent  ' s intention is good , i.e.
not shifting of responsibility , etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#63:1>
Also the change proposal quality is not a question . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#64:1>
The first factor of resistance to change is the nature of change
i.e. the courage of the change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#65:1>
It can be further divided into 2 dimensions i.e. scope of change and
depth of change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#66:1>
The scope of change means the area of change affected .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#67:1>
It may be a component , a sub-system or the whole system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#68:1>
The depth of change may be a procedural one , a programmatic one or a
basic one . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#69:1>
From the above , we can find that resistance will increase if we
go from left to right and from top to down .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#70:1>
Thus we may find that change in procedure in a component is the
easiest one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#71:1>
Change involves a system and it is a basic change , resistance will
be the greatest . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#72:1>
As implied from the above analysis , the change agent must pay
attention to the nature of change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#73:1>
If he wants to change , it is effective if it start from one
component first and then generalize to sub-system and then the while system .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#74:1>
Such procedure will not give threat to other component/decision
makers , it is because it provides a model and a demonstration effect .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#75:1>
Apply the same logic , change best starts from a procedural one .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#76:1>
Together with this point , the change agent must also aware of the
potential risk caused by the change .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#77:1>
High risk proposal includes changes that are changes that once starts
it cannot stop .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#78:1>
Thus the change proposal <del> is </del> employing a incrementalistic
manner/steps by steps will expect less resistance . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#79:1>
The second factor that affecting the acceptance of the change
proposal in the value orientation of decision makers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#80:1>
Decision makers include board-members , executives , administrators
directors .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#81:1>
Such people holds the position that is crucial in the acceptance of
the change proposal . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#82:1>
The value holds by the decision makers including , prestige ,
power , income , safety , status , ...etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#83:1>
Such values do exist in every decision makers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#84:1>
These value will affect whether the change proposal is accept or not .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#85:1>
If the <-> precieved </-> <+> perceived </+> benefits coincide with
the value of the decision-makers , it will likely the proposal be accepted .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#86:1>
It must be pointed out that every people will have a mixture of
values , the problem is how such value is arranged in the hierarchy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#87:1>
Thus it is important for us to have an understanding about this
hierarchy . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#88:1>
It is very interesting to notice that values usually appear in
group/clusters .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#89:1>
Generally speaking , decision makers can be classified into climber
and conserver .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#90:1>
Conserver will value what he has in hand .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#91:1>
So he is not likely to accept change proposal that affect the status
quo .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#92:1>
He will tend to accept proposals that not intending to &ldquo;
change&rdquo; .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#93:1>
He will treasure stability .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#94:1>
If we use the innovative consolidation continuum , he will fall in
the consolidation end .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#95:1>
Another type of people is the climber .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#96:1>
He will try efforts to gain power , prestige etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#97:1>
He inclines to accept proposals that brings power to him .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#98:1>
Under the innovative consolidation continuum , he may shift from one
end to another depending on situation . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#99:1>
Another type of person that we need to pay attention is the
professional advocacy .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#100:1>
He will tend to accept proposal that bring benefit to client or the
profession .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#101:1>
Thus proposal brings these change will he accepted by he . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#102:1>
From this point , we can see that the <-> precieved </-> <+>
perceived </+> benefit to the decision-makers affect the acceptance of the
proposal .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#103:1>
In order to overcome this , some skills can be used .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#104:1>
The most important one is the presentation skills .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#105:1>
Proposal must speak in the language of the decision makers , start
where they are .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#106:1>
The distortion and condensation of ideas as the proposal may travel
a long &ldquo; distance&rdquo; before it reaches the decision makers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#107:1>
We must also identify the goal hierarchy of the decision makers by
reviewing the history of change under the decision of the decision makers in
order to find out what kind of <-> precieved </-> <+> perceived </+>
advantages is effective .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#108:1>
We may also find out who is the real &ldquo; decision makers&rdquo;
, i.e. who is the key person in the decision process . </p> <h>

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#109:1>
2 </h>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#110:1>
Before the exploration of reflection by social worker on his/her
own feelings , values and perspectives , I would like to have a little remark
on what is mean by responsible social work practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#111:1>
The objectives of social work practice have long been a question .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#112:1>
Some will argue that social work aims at enhancing people  ' s social
function , some will say that <-> it's</-> <+> its </+> aim is the
accommodation of life tasks .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#113:1>
Whatever the objectives are , the common point is that all is
concerning about the well-being of people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#114:1>
Arguments fall in different views about the well-being of individual
or even society .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#115:1>
Here the responsible social work practice means the promotion of
well being of individual/ society/system . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#116:1>
To say that reflection by the social worker on his/her own
feelings , values and perspectives is an integral part of responsible social
work practice , we can explore this in three ways : the scheme praxis , the
comprehensive frame-work of social work practice , and the mature of social
work practice . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#117:1>
To use the Marxist notion of praxis , we can see that at the top
of the scheme it is the knowledge , theory and experience of social workers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#118:1>
Passing through the social reality and the <-> indetermine </-> <+>
<?> indeterminate </?> </+> zone , it comes to the part of problem framing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#119:1>
Then it is intervention which involves clients , workers .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#120:1>
This is constrained by social norm , moral value .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#121:1>
Workers need to reflect &ampersand; <?> seizing </?> about these .
</p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#122:1>
In the scheme , we can see the function of feelings &ampersand;
values beliefs in problem framing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#123:1>
Problem framing needs the workers to consider about the feelings
&ampersand; values/beliefs in the process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#124:1>
E.g. if the worker employs a liberal feminist &obrack; a prevailing
view in Hong Kong nowadays &cbrack; , then when she/he encounters family
problems she may employ such values .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#125:1>
She/he may consider the family to be lay on family decision process .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#126:1>
Thus she/he may encourage the women in question to participate in
the decision of family process , employment is needed as to open the scope of
view or to redefine the burden of household duty .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#127:1>
Another example is concerning the political attitude of worker
towards 1997 .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#128:1>
Such 1997 crisis is the main concern of people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#129:1>
If a community worker  ' s feeling towards 1997 is fear , his
undervalue the coming of change of ownership to China and he has a negative
perspective , then we may find that he encourage people to <-> fled </-> <+>
flee </+> , to <-> emmigrate </-> <+> emigrate </+> , to leave , to employ a
passive attitude .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#130:1>
Because he consider the problem lay in China which cannot be changed
within a period of time .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#131:1>
If the situation is reversed , he may employ a constructive way to
handle 1997 , e.g. understanding China  ' s situation , try to protect human
rights tgrough legislation at present, try to promote the economic progress
of China , ...etc .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#132:1>
Thus we can see that <-> falings </-> <+> <?> feelings </?> </+>
&ampersand; value play an important role in the process of problem frame .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#133:1>
This leads to different strategies of change/intervention which are
the result of problem framing .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#134:1>
Such intervention points to the well being of people . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#135:1>
In the top of the scheme , it is the knowledge , experience and
theory .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#136:1>
This constitutes the theoretical perspective of workers &obrack; to
me , values , feeling and beliefs are also perspective employed by workers
&cbrack; Such perspective operated with the fusion of social reality forms
the base for problem framing . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#137:1>
In 1990  ' s , Hong Kong can be said to be dominated by the
attitude of profit-making .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#138:1>
If such perspective is employed by social workers , he may consider
the well being of people to be the maximization of profit .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#139:1>
Such point of view is quite danger as we know that money will lead
to the lose of  ' real  '  self which is not constituted by money . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#140:1>
As in the scheme of praxis , societal norms &ampersand; value is
important .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#141:1>
As one of the members in the society , social workers are also under
the influences of such norms &ampersand; moral constraint .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#142:1>
Thus we need to reflect these value/ belief in order not to be blind
in practice . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#143:1>
Generally speaking , when employing the scheme of praxis ,
feelings , values and perspective is important in problem-framing which is
the base for intervention which aims at promoting well being of human being .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#144:1>
Thus we must reflect these in practice . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#145:1>
The second way to analysis the problem is comprehensive
frame-work of social work practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#146:1>
In the framework , values and knowledge play an important part in
the framework .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#147:1>
If we think that feeling is associated with knowledge and value ,
again we can see its importance .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#148:1>
Value and knowledge which give people perspective is the base of
generic practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#149:1>
If we think that community care is important perspective and caring
community is the end , then our goal and intervention will follow this line
of thought .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#150:1>
As people are guided by this perspective in assessment and formulate
the objective of social work practice . </p>
<p> 
<ICE-HK:W1A-013#151:1>
The third way to find reflection important comes from the nature
of practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#152:1>
Some have said the social work is unclear in knowledge , outcome ,
intervention , thus we need to reflect these always especially in
intervention .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#153:1>
In case of uncertainty ideology &obrack; come from value &ampersand;
knowledge perspective &cbrack; will guide people to act .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#154:1>
This is the heuristic search of practice .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#155:1>
Some have said that social work is a moral action , we must also
reflect our value and perspective more as we are affecting other people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#156:1>
In order to help people , we must understanding .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#157:1>
Such understanding is impossible of we lack dialogue .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#158:1>
Dialogue will be facilitated if we are aware of our values
&ampersand; <-> prespectives </-> <+> perspectives </+> and want to
contribute to the well-being of other people .

<ICE-HK:W1A-013#159:1>
In the forth coming of 1997 , well being is a state in question .
</p> </I>
