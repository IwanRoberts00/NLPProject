<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#1:1:A>
On the back of them was Win Win

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#2:1:A>
he done a little bit of work after that ordinary getaway <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#3:1:A>
in the centre in the pink was King Warrior <,> and back behind them
Major Moves <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#4:1:A>
now this horse got held up in the straight the horse in the pink cap
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#5:1:A>
it  ' s been a pretty good run by him <,> and his best effort on the
sand surface by far

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#6:1:A>
Two hundred out though we  ' ve got Golden Apple and New Hero <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#7:1:A>
New Hero  ' s gone <,> sweeping to the front No Money No Honey <,>
running on fairly King Warrior <,> down the outside Win Win and coming
through late Major Moves for the minor

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#8:1:A>
But getting away near home No Money No Honey <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#9:1:A>
nice ride and it scores comfortably by two on the wire with Major
Moves not a bad effort in third

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#10:1:B>
And don't forget there was a late scratching in that race

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#11:1:B>

Tien Caulfield <unc> one-word </unc> and Tai Lam combining

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#19:1:B>
single figure quote of ninety-one dollars <,,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#20:1:B>
As we take a look now at Ho Tao Emperor <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#21:1:B>
he  ' s opened up favourite at twenty-five dollars <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#22:1:B>
he  ' s with a stablemate there of course Free and Comfort <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#23:1:B>
it  ' s Hotel Emperor on the outside of that piece of work

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#24:1:B>
Hieden Cheung is the rider

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#25:1:B>
And Mr Dinosaur here <,> a speedy galloper Peter Lau and Louis Ho
<,> and Mr Dinosaur thirty-six dollars

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#26:1:B>
Obviously one of the sources of speed in this particular race

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#27:1:B>
On screen now is number six Rainbow Rocket <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#28:1:B>
early favourite now shortening all the time is number eight Ho Tao
Emperor as we welcome to the microphone Franko Lau

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#29:1:C>
Good evening Steve and uh on the screen area is number six
Rainbow Rocket <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#30:1:C>
Uh this <,> horse has raced six starts here in Macau and all of
them well beaten and uh just see that figuring in this race uh of course
Rambo Tse has been off <unc> one-word </unc> for a while but is
coming back to ride here this evening so all the best to him

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#31:1:B>
Yeah nice to see Rambo Tse back in action <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#32:1:B>
of course suffered a fall towards the end of last season and has
taken a while to uh get it all together

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#33:1:B>
Uh he  ' s had a few injuries but nice to see him back in action but
Rainbow Rocket I don't think will be uh bringing him a winner tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#34:1:B>
he looks class six material

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#35:1:B>
Here is Mr Dinosaur uh a speedy horse <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#36:1:B>
always deserves top three claims one for sure and certain you must
put in quinellas

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#37:1:B>
you must put in tierces uh seven to two as far as winning the race
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#38:1:B>
fair enough he is one of the main chances in the race

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#39:1:B>
I wouldn't say no about him uh probably also deserves to be uh
around that quote as well so <,> he  ' s a definite chance and lightly waited
one hundred and eighteen pounds

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#40:1:C>
Mr Dinosaur he is a very consistent runner on the sand

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#41:1:C>
his last three runs was a second and two thirds so far <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#42:1:C>
well uh he has the blinkers removed and tongue tie removed this
evening so uh maybe he can settle a bit behind uh pacemaker in this race so
<,> he should have a strong chance to win the race and hasn't been winning a
race for a while so uh this could be the night for him

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#43:1:B>
We just some Tien Caulfield <,> although we  ' ll skip now to
number five Diamond Join

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#44:1:B>
A speedy horse uh hasn't been the strongest so far <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#45:1:B>
he did draw uh the inside gate over this trip last time

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#46:1:B>
I think one big positive though about Diamond Join Franko <,> was
in a much harder race last time <,> he drops twelve pounds at the weights uh
definitely speedy and weak <,> but I  ' ve have to throw him forward the way
this sand is riding as a chance tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#47:1:B>
Barrier One <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#48:1:B>
if he goes hard in front he could just hold on for a little more
tonight

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#49:1:C>
Well Steve he has speed but weak at the finish as he showed
previously and uh going by the run on twelve hundred metres on the turf in
class four

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#50:1:C>
he has speed and also weakened <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#51:1:C>
he carried only one hundred and fifteen pounds on that score <,> so
I thought uh not uh to many chances for him this evening

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#52:1:C>
Number seven here is uh Ball of Fire <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#53:1:C>
he has been disappointing so far <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#54:1:C>
only two places so far on the turf and maybe he didn't really like
the sand surface

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#55:1:B>
yeah I thought uh the run was slightly better last starting
class four so I think I  ' d drop that run down a grade he  ' s now in the class
five ranks and <,> uh I think we have to uh I think there <,> uh he just
might start coming to hand there Ball of Fire

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#56:1:B>
Uh Barry Baldwin prepares Danny Beasley of course who rode the
previous winner is aboard uh I think we might just start seeing some better
efforts from the horse now <,> particularly on that latest run but he has <,>
while he run in class four last time <,> he has actually also run in the
class five ranks and been defeated before <,> but I think it  ' s the key he
just might be ready uh or starting to come to hand sorry

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#57:1:B>
Number four Genius Guy on screen gets so far back in the race it  ' s
always the worry but <,> by far and large uh the best graded horse probably
of the night just in <,> not just in this race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#58:1:B>
he  ' s the best graded horse of the night Genius Guy but uh it just
depends on how far back he  ' s going to get once again

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#59:1:C>
Uh I couldn't give him a chance <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#60:1:C>
uh obviously the distance will be too short for him

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#61:1:C>
it would not be as worse if a fifteen hundred or sixteen hundred
metre event

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#62:1:C>
I  ' d give him a chance uh but not thirteen hundred metres

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#63:1:C>
David Brereton doing the riding for the Joe Murphy uh stable

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#64:1:B>
Yeah there  ' s going to be a uh day Franko he  ' s uh just going
to come home and surprise everyone Genius Guy due to the fact that he  ' s
certainly too well graded

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#65:1:B>
One good thing about this uh tonight Franko about Genius Guy <,> I  ' m
not a fan of him in the race <,> but if you uh really do like him a couple of
uh good pointers are with Diamond Join and Mr Dinosaur in the race <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#66:1:B>
they are going to fly in front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#67:1:B>
uh they are going to go very very quick so if there  ' s any <,> I
mean uh obviously that speed just might uh help Genius Guy if they do do if
they do go too quick tonight

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#68:1:B>
Number two Lotus Of Jebwin <,> not entirely <.> dis </.> disgraced
in his first two runs and with naturally improving and dropping a grade <,>
uh you  ' d have to expect uh some better runs from him now

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#69:1:C>
Yeah he had a tough run last time over one thousand metres he
was caught wide from the wire on a wide draw <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#70:1:C>
this time a much better draw for him so I expect him to uh have an
improved run and uh maybe he can run a bit better over thirteen hundred
metres uh this time

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#71:1:C>
Number ten here is Yantze Warrior <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#72:1:C>
so far he has been disappointing

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#73:1:C>
only uh three three placings on the turf and uh lightly raced on uh
the sand so far

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#74:1:C>
Last time was beaten by six lengths over one thousand metres and uh
I thought he was looking for class six

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#75:1:B>
He  ' s had a few problems <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#76:1:B>
sand runs just fair but <,> you do expect him to be uh in uh at
least in some fitness uh after two runs back from a spell tonight <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#77:1:B>
form lines though aren't really the best but <,> again uh has been
lightly raced and uh with two runs under his belt he could now start
improving

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#78:1:B>
Quickly talk about the others <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#79:1:B>
Chiu Wah Best is number one

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#80:1:B>
disappointing his two sand runs <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#81:1:B>
he now reaches a more competitive mark but still needs to improve
<,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#82:1:B>
Chris Maund is the new rider

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#83:1:C>
Again uh probably he is not really a fan of the sand surface
visors on for the first time this evening <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#84:1:C>
uh he has been placed second over fourteen hundred meters on turf
when he was a griffin

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#85:1:B>
Number three Tien Caulfield shouldn't stay at this mark for
very long showed speed in class four last time <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#86:1:B>
drop that run down a grade and he can certainly figure tonight

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#87:1:C>
Uh perhaps he can a figure in the top three but not the winner
of race for me from barrier ten it would be very awkward for him

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#88:1:C>
And Ho Tao Emperor <,> better effort two runs from a spell <,> uh
his latest he did win in this grade over fifteen hundred metres

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#89:1:C>
Yes Ho Tao Emperor he has a chance in this race but heading to the
break back shortly <&> Commericial Break </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#90:1:B>
In fact we are now going to go for a replay of the first race
the Kimberly Handicap class five gallopers

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#91:1:A>
And they are off and running <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#92:1:A>
I Can Fly made a dive at the gates just prior to them opening but
he got away okay

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#93:1:A>
In the early part Shining Sun showing out in front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#94:1:A>
I Can fly scooting through in the centre now to take up the running
from Knowledgeable <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#95:1:A>
crowded a bit deep Golden Millennium even wider Polyline as they
swing into the back

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#96:1:A>
Shining Sun now drops back to take the <unc> one-word
</unc> he  ' s back in fifth <,> a little bit deep Grinch but not far off
them as they run into the back followed by midfield Kiwi

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#97:1:A>
About four back Happy Triumph followed by Mr Dragon and King  ' s
Charm is the tailender

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#98:1:A>
Eight hundred meters out <,> I Can Fly is the pilot narrowly from
in the centre Knowledgeable <,> making a line of three Polyline <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#99:1:A>
he  ' s having a tough run as they go to the six hundred <,> on the
backs of them Shining Sun <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#100:1:A>
Grinch not too far away travelling okay and he starts to sneak
into the race a little bit deep

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#101:1:A>
On the back of them was Golden Millennium now dropping back then
was Kiwi he  ' s under plenty of pressure <,> followed then by sneaking up on
the inside of him is Happy Triumph Mr Dragon and Kings Charm the tailender

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#102:1:A>
On towards the corner <,> I Can Fly takes over and he dashes away

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#103:1:A>
he leads by two <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#104:1:A>
Grinch travelling nicely gets into second <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#105:1:A>
Polyline battling and likewise Knowledgeable and down the outside
Golden Millennium running a bit of a race

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#106:1:A>
I Can Fly in front

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#107:1:A>
one hundred and fifty out <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#108:1:A>
Grinch the danger Golden Millennium running on <,> I Can Fly a
narrow leader Grinch inch by inch is cutting him down <,> Grinch gets along
side <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#109:1:A>
puts the head in front <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#110:1:A>
Grinch the narrow leader as they go to the line he  ' ll take the
prize

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#111:1:A>
Grinch first

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#112:1:A>
I Can Fly second

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S2A-003#113:1:B>
He  ' s finally done it Grinch

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#114:1:B>
I  ' ve been tipping him forever <,>

<ICE-HK:S2A-003#115:1:B>
uh one three and five were the numbers for race one </I>
