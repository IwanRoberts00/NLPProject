Recently heavy rainfall has led to a serious deterioration in
water quality at some of the territory  ' s beaches , the Environmental
Protection Department said yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#4:1>
A department spokesman warned swimmers to stay away from beaches
for up to three days after a storm and said that heavy rain had flushed large
quantities of pollutants into the sea , particularly at beaches close to
developed areas . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#5:1>
Latest tests show that water quality at at least nine of the 45
beaches with water quality grades , including six on the south side of Hong
Kong Island , have dropped in the past two weeks .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#6:1>
Four gazetted beaches &dash; Anglers  '  , Castle Peak , Old Cafeteria
and Rocky Bay &dash; remain closed to swimmers because of high health hazards .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#7:1>
The spokesman said that grades fluctuated wildly during the summer
because storms and stronger tides affected pollution at beaches . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#8:1>
&ldquo; Besides with highly developed hinterlands are likely to be
more polluted than the grades suggest during and after heavy rain . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#9:1>
&ldquo; Bathers should avoid such beaches for two or three days
after a storm , longer if the weather remains overcast or shorter if there is
strong sunshine , &rdquo; the spokesman said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#10:1>
Beaches on the south side of Hong Kong Island remain the most
hazardous places to swim , with Big Wave Bay , Shek O and Hairpin beaches
rating as poor.

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#11:1>
Water quality at the three has dropped from fair in previous weeks .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#12:1>
Only South Bay was rated as &ldquo; good &rdquo; while the
remaining beaches were average . </p> </I>

<bold> Anger at scouts  '  mahjong jamboree </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#14:2>
<bold> Chris Cheng </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#15:2>
The Scout Association has defended attacks from scout leaders
that a fund-raising mahjong tournament will set a bad example for scout and
cubs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#16:2>
The contest , to be held in October , is to raise funds for its
new headquarters . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#17:2>
Many scout leaders believe using mahjong to raise money would
give many youngsters the impression gambling was an acceptable <-> past-time
</-> <+> pastime </+> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#18:2>
They say that the tournament breaches the scouts  '  code of ethics .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#19:2>
The association has insisted that gambling will be banned from
the tournament and the only payments will be players  '  entry fees .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#20:2>
The association has told its leaders that participants should be
either superintendents , committee members , or scout leaders who are aged 18
or above . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#21:2>
The tournament hopes to raise at least &dollar;4m . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#22:2>
A leader of a school  ' s scout group , who would only give his
name as Wong , said he was disturbed because mahjong and its association with
gambling contravened the spirit of scouting .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#23:2>
He said that scouting should not be associated with the tournament .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#24:2>
Daniel Leung , the acting chief scout executive , said : &ldquo;
It is just a charitable game which involves our own members .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#25:2>
This has nothing to do with gambling . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#26:2>
&ldquo; The money is to build a new headquarters . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#27:2>
Leung said the association chose mahjong for its fund-raiser
because it was a very popular game and it would attract more members . </p>

Scared Tuen Mun residents yesterday repeated their call for the
re-opening of neighbourhood police offices and a greater police presence
after the area  ' s latest sex attack , this time on an 11-year-old girl . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#31:3>
The girl was stripped and photographed in broad day-light on
Wednesday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#32:3>
During a meeting with legislators yesterday , members of a Tuen
Mun concern group demanded immediate action . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#33:3>
Their representative , Ng Hak-keung , said there was an urgent
need to reopen the police offices . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#34:3>
The latest attack took place early on Wednesday .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#35:3>
The young girl was molested only metres from her second-floor home in
On Hei House , Yau Oi Estate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#36:3>
She was on her way home from a supermarket when the assailant
carried her to the third floor , ordered her to strip , took photographs of
her and indecently assaulted her . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#37:3>
It was the ninth attack in the attack in the area since July ,
when the teenager , Ip Wing-sze , was raped and murdered in the nearby Leung
Chun House , Leung King Estate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#38:3>
More attacks took place despite the arrests of seven people in
relation to the crimes . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#39:3>
Five of those arrested have been charged . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#40:3>
Ng told legislators there were many police offices in Tuen Mun 10
years ago but they were closed about five years ago due to a police manpower
shortage . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#41:3>
He said the closures might have indirectly contributed to the
recent deterioration of law and order in the district . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#42:3>
Another group member , Rebecca So , said having the neighbourhood
police offices set up in densely-populated areas had many advantages . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#43:3>
&ldquo; If there is an NPO in our area , policemen stationed
there who are familiar with the district would find it easier to get around ,
&rdquo; she said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#44:3>
&ldquo; If there is a crime , they would be able to get to the
scene of the crime much quicker . &rdquo; </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#45:3>
So said the offices could act as a preventative measure to
discourage crimes and improve communication between policemen and local
residents . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#46:3>
So said she hoped that if the police were really concerned about
the safety of Tuen Mun residents , they would reopen the neighbourhood police
offices immediately and increase the police presence . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#47:3>
A legislator , Allen Lee , said after meeting residents that he
realised the importance of police offices in preventing crimes and would
raise the issue with the Legislative Council  ' s Security Panel . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#48:3>
To Kun-sun , another legislator , said this issue was worth
further discussion .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#49:3>
He said he was sure all councilors would agree that expenditure on
social security should be increased if necessary . </p> </I>

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#52:4>
The Government  ' s decision to import 11,000 workers was attacked
by another trade union yesterday . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#53:4>
The union demanded the labour importation policy be scrapped
immediately in order to protect local workers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#54:4>
The Hong Kong Department Stores and Commercial Staff General
Union yesterday objected to the Government  ' s allocation of a large quota of
about 3,200 jobs in retailing and the import and export sectors to imported
workers . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#55:4>
The chairwoman of the union , Chan Yuen-han , said labour groups
had explained to the Government the importance of retraining employees from
declining industries to fill gaps in other industries , but the Government
never considered their opinions . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#56:4>
It ignored the rights of Hong Kong workers by extending the
labour importation policy , making many local workers , especially those over
35 and with little schooling , unable to find suitable jobs . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#57:4>
Chan said she had received many complaints from workers who could
not find jobs after finishing courses provided by the Employees Retraining
Board &obrack; ERB &cbrack; . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#58:4>
She said statistics showed there was a serious shrinkage in the
manufacturing industry , from 890,000 workers in 1988 to 455,900 this year .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#59:4>
She said the hotel industry had the same problem . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#60:4>
&ldquo; In the first six months this year , six or seven hotels
closed , making over 4,000 workers unemployed , &rdquo; Chan said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#61:4>
Under this situation , the Government and the ERB should help
workers solve their employment problems and not import labour , making the
condition worse , Chan said . </p> </I>

<bold> Education of elderly &lsquo; inadequately funded &rsquo;
</bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#63:5>
<bold> Chris Cheng </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#64:5>
An educational group has condemned the Government for not
providing adequate funds to educate the elderly . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#65:5>
The Hong Kong Association for Continuing Education said the
Government was ignoring the right of the elderly to be educated . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#66:5>
Cheung Man-ping , the secretary of the association , said the
Government had recently feigned concern for the elderly with its proposed old
age pension scheme . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#67:5>
He said officials had failed to provide adequate funds for
elderly education and had hampered any development in the area . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#68:5>
Cheung said that education helped old and retired people
establish self-confidence and added meaning to their lives . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#69:5>
He said according to the Education Department , about &dollar;1m
was provided for elderly education in 1993-95 and 4,025 old people benefited
from the funding . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#70:5>
In the current fiscal year , the Government has allocated about
&dollar;1.5m , which is expected to benefit 5,400 elderly people . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#71:5>
&ldquo; On average , each old person only receive a &dollar;300
subsidy , while each ordinary school-age student can be subsidised with more
than &dollar;10,000 each year , &rdquo; Cheung said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#72:5>
Cheung said in some Western countries and in China , governments
had life-long educational concepts which meant that learning should not be
age-bound . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#73:5>
He urged the Government to set up an old people  ' s affairs
committee to handle elderly education . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#74:5>
In Wing-chak , the principal of the Christian Hong Kong Nam Wah
Post Secondary College , which has provided the elderly with education for
about 10 years , said there were several hundred universities and countless
schools providing education for more than 300,000 old people in China . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#75:5>
Kwan Li-ming , a former school principal who now studies theology
at Nam Wah College , said that old people needed schooling particularly in an
advanced society where new technology developed every day . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#76:5>
Kwan , who pays &dollar;350 in tuition fees each month , said
some old people could not afford such rates . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#77:5>
He said if it was possible , he would continue his learning in
order to get a doctorate . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#78:5>
&ldquo; I would continue my learning until the last day of my
life , &rdquo; Kwan said . </p> </I>

<bold> Qingling Motor makes glittering H stare debut </bold> </h> <h>

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#80:6>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#81:6>
CHINA  ' s Qingling Motor made a powerful stock market debut
yesterday , climbing 68 per cents or 32.85 per cent to close at &dollar;2.75 .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#82:6>
The glittering performance was , however , in line with
expectations and appeared to justify the reduction in price-earnings ratio
based on the offer price . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#83:6>
A hefty 159.9 million shares worth &dollar;436.08 million changed
hands . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#84:6>
Analysts had expected the truck assembler to rise 25 per cent on
its first day , a performance that contrasts with the previous issue and
highlights the reversal in sentiment over the past month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#85:6>
Luoyang Glass , the last H share issue , slumped 20 per cent from
its issue price when it made its debut last month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#86:6>
Qingling Motor , the 11th H share to be listed in Hong Kong ,
rose sharply from the offer price of &dollar;2.07 to hit a high of
&dollar;3.00 , a 44.9 per cent record increase on its first day of trading .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#87:6>
A research analyst from Sun Hung Kai Securities , Li Shing Wa ,
said the good debut performance of Qingling was largely due to positive
market sentiment . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#88:6>
The decision by Morgan Stanley to reduce Japan  ' s weighting in
its global equity portfolio from 30 per cent to 20 per cent meant the stock
had attracted more speculation , he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#89:6>
&ldquo; The share is likely to edge up further as fund managers
may buy the stock for long-term investment and not for short-term speculation
, &rdquo; said the senior analyst at PW Asia Brokerage , Kinson Au . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#90:6>
Qingling fixed on offer price at a price/earnings &obrack; P/E
&cbrack; ratio of nine , the lowest of the 10 H stocks already listed in the
territory . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#91:6>
Its public offering for 100 million H shares in Hong Kong was
22.5 times oversubscribed . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#92:6>
&ldquo; The P/E was appropriate judging from the market situation
, &rdquo; chairman , Wu Yun said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#93:6>
The company hoped to raise about &dollar;1.03 billion from its
public offer . </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#96:7>
CELLULAR phone operator SmarTone Mobile Communications has
launched a series of new services and coverage networks to build on its
competitive position in the local market , according to SmarTone chief
executive office Douglas Li . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#97:7>
&ldquo; InfoAccess , &rdquo; a new service which will let
subscribers call a taxi , book a movie ticket , reserve ferry tickets for
Macau , or get airline and banking information by using a &ldquo; quick dial
&rdquo; access code on their mobile phone . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#98:7>
Also , there will be a new personal virtual fax service that
allows subscribers to be aware of incoming faxes and retrieve them anytime
and anywhere they happen to be . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#99:7>
The Info service will proceed this week and the fax service will
be introduced within the next few months , Mr Li said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#100:7>
&ldquo; In addition , we plan to expand our automatic
international roaming service to add more countries to the 10 already covered .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#101:7>
&ldquo; The subscribers will soon see this service being
provided in Singapore , Germany , France , Belgium , Thailand , Indonesia and
the Philippines , &rdquo; he added . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#102:7>
Locally , SmarTone has invested about &dollar;150 million in a
second Mobile Switch Centre and Base Station Controller , located in Kwai
Chung .

<ICE-HK:W2C-020#103:7>
Mr Li is banking on a potential increase of more than tens of
thousands of customers for this service . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#104:7>
The company is now waiting for Hong Kong Telecom CSL to upgrade
its antenna system on the MTR network due to the limited capacity of the
system , Mr Li said . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#105:7>
On top of that , a new customer service division will move to
new premises in Quarry Bay by end of this month . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#106:7>
Mr Li pointed out that by the end of the year , their digital
cellular service customer base will have grown 250 per cent , from last year  ' s
20,000 to 70,000 . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-HK:W2C-020#107:7>
More than 50 per cent of the market share will be owned by the
company , Mr Li said . </p> </I>
