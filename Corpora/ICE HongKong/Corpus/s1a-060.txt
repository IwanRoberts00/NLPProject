I don't live in any hall

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X35:1:Z>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X36:1:Z>
Do you wish you lived in hall </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#37:1:D>
Oh <,> I don't wish

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X38:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#39:1:D>
Because uh uh in hall there may be uhm <,> many activities

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#40:1:D>
Uh that <,> I think uh may make me uh no time for revision

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X41:1:Z>
Uhm <,> uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#42:1:D>

What about you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X45:1:Z>
Yvonne </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#46:1:C>
Uhm I  ' m <,> I wish to live in hall for a <,> while

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#47:1:C>
Uhm because I think <,> uh living in hall is a part of the U life

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#48:1:C>
And I want to try it

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#49:1:C>
Uhm <,> but the disadvantage is uh <,> just as Jachin said

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#50:1:C>
Uhm <,> there  ' s too many activities you want to take part

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#51:1:C>
And there  ' s no time for <,> homework or <.> re </.> revision

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#52:1:C>
Uhm <,> but I <,> also want to try it

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X53:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X54:1:Z>
Are they right <,> about the

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X55:1:Z>
You know the problems of living in hall </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#56:1:B>
Uh there are <,> of course many activities

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#57:1:B>
But I think the most important thing is that

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#58:1:B>
Uh you need to know

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#59:1:B>
Which is the most important to you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#60:1:B>
If you think

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#61:1:B>
Uh <,> at that time

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#62:1:B>
You need to study

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#63:1:B>
You just go to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X64:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#65:1:B>
Uh <,> ignore other things

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#66:1:C>
But they force you to go

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#67:1:C>
To take part

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X68:1:Z>
<{> <[> Yeah </[> </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#69:1:D>
<[> Is it </[> </{> <,> easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#70:1:D>
To ignore all the <{> <[> things </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#71:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X72:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#73:1:B>
Uh <,> I think it  ' s <,> need to practise <&> Laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X74:1:Z>
Uhm <&> somebody coughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X75:1:Z>
But <,,> I mean I think Yvonne  ' s got a good point

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X76:1:Z>
I  ' ve heard <,> people say that <,> that certain activities are
compulsory

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X77:1:Z>
Is that true </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#78:1:B>
Uh

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X79:1:Z>
See Tellus is nodding </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#80:1:A>
Uh some of the activities are compulsory

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#81:1:A>
But not all

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#82:1:A>
Uh <,> I agree with Jimmy that uh <,> you have the <,> right to
choose

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#83:1:A>
Uhm <,> of course uh <,> uh some <,> you must <.> pat </.>
participate in

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#84:1:A>
But uh many others you need not to participate

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#85:1:A>
<{> <[> It  ' s just </[> up to you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#86:1:A>
Uhm <,> if you <,> are good at manage how to manage your times

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#87:1:A>
Uhm <,> it  ' s no problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X88:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X89:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X90:1:Z>
If <,> as a big if

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X91:1:Z>
<{> <[> Isn't it </[>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X92:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X93:1:Z>
Don't you find there  ' s a lot of peer pressure </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#94:1:A>
<[> <unc> two words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#95:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X96:1:Z>
You know

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X97:1:Z>
That your hallmates are <,> pushing you to participate </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#98:1:A>
Uhm <,> it is not <,> uh <,> necessary to participate in

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#99:1:A>
Uh so <,> if you  ' re not

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#100:1:A>
Uh <,> are really not interest in this part

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#101:1:A>
Uh <,> you <,> can ignore this pressure

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X102:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X103:1:Z>
I think it  ' s easy to say

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X104:1:Z>
But do you really think it  ' s easy to do </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#105:1:C>
Uhm <,> I think it  ' s not easy

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#106:1:C>
Because <,> uhm <,> when there  ' s <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#107:1:C>
Uhm <,> most of the uh roommates

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#108:1:C>
Are participate in the teams

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#109:1:C>
You will be affect by them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#110:1:C>
And you have no <.> top </.> <,> talking topics with them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#111:1:C>
Because <,> you are uh <,> have no words to say to them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#112:1:C>
And they don't like to talk to you

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X113:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X114:1:Z>
You mean because you haven't <,> participated with them </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#115:1:C>
Yeah

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X116:1:Z>
Same as when you didn't say hello to me today <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X117:1:Z>
Outside the library </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#118:1:C>
I haven't seen you <&> Laughter </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X119:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X120:1:Z>
Do I mean

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X121:1:Z>
Does that happen

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X122:1:Z>
Jimmy </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#123:1:B>
Happen to me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X124:1:Z>
Well

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X125:1:Z>
Not necessarily to you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X126:1:Z>
But <,> other people in hall

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X127:1:Z>
Does it happen that <,> if they don't participate

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X128:1:Z>
You ignore them </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#129:1:B>
But I think it  ' s uh <,> to different people

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#130:1:B>
Uhm <,> if someone has a <,> kind heart

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#131:1:B>
Uh he would <,> find something to <,> talk to you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#132:1:B>
<{> <[> Try to find something </[> <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#133:1:B>
Sometime it  ' s it will be <,> uhm difficult for him to talk to you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#134:1:B>
If you don't <,> uhm <,> don't <,> participate in some activities

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#135:1:B>
Uh or <,> nearly all <,> hall <?> 1ights </?> <,> will
participates

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X136:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X137:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#138:1:B>
Uhm <,> but I think that  ' s just a <,> very small proportion

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#139:1:B>
Of our of our <,> topic in the discussion

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X140:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#141:1:B>
Better than uh in the talking <,> uh <,> something

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#142:1:B>
In the talking <{1> <[1> <,> talking </[1> <{2> <[2> policy </[2>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X143:1:Z>
<[1> Talk talking with whom </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X144:1:Z>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X145:1:Z>
Uh OK <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X146:1:Z>
Uhm Jachin do you think it would be a problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X147:1:Z>
If you were in hall <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X148:1:Z>
Now you said already that <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X149:1:Z>
One of the problems would be finding time to do things </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#150:1:D>
It may be a problem

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X151:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#152:1:D>
Uh but uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#153:1:D>
I agree uhm <,> I <.> agr </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#154:1:D>
I agree that uhm <,> uh <,> it  ' s a good practice

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#155:1:D>
To learn how to manage your time

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#156:1:D>
Your personal <&>

$Z-clears-throat </&> time

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#157:1:D>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X158:1:Z>
I supposing you don't learn <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X159:1:Z>
Don't you think it would be a disaster </X> <&> Somebody-coughs
</&>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#160:1:D>
Uh <,> I think it depends on the <,> the actual circumstances
<,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#161:1:D>
I think it  ' s difficult to guess

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#162:1:D>
Uh what the <.> re </.> what the result will be

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X163:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#164:1:D>
But uhm I think <,> uhm <,> if <,> living in hall

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#165:1:D>
There are many activities

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#166:1:D>
But uh <,> I think some activities <,> is very good

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X167:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#168:1:D>
And <,> and <,> I think <,> uh <,> we can learn how to <,>
how to uh <,> communicate with other people

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X169:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#170:1:D>
And how to live with other people

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#171:1:D>
I think uh this is uh invaluable

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#172:1:D>
But I still <,> worry about uh <,> uh living in hall maybe uh <,>
less or <?> maybe </?> no personal time

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X173:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X174:1:Z>
<{> <[> I  ' ve </[> <,> I  ' ve heard a lot of people say that

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X175:1:Z>
Surely must be some truth in it

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X176:1:Z>
Now I think Tellus has a got a good point

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X177:1:Z>
If you  ' re well organized

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X178:1:Z>
And so on and so on

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X179:1:Z>
It  ' s not a problem

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X180:1:Z>
And she looks like a well organized person <&> Somebody-laughs
</&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X181:1:Z>
But <,> then when we look at Jimmy

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X182:1:Z>
I  ' m not so sure <&> Laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X183:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X185:1:Z>
Seriously

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X186:1:Z>
Just my impression

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X187:1:Z>
That you probably <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X188:1:Z>
Not so easy for you to say no to your friends

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X189:1:Z>

If you really want to get any work done

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X198:1:Z>
You don't go back to the hall

You  ' d really be in trouble because you won't be able to study at
the hall

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X248:1:Z>
And you wouldn't be able to study in the library

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X249:1:Z>

This time is uh not a <,> studying time

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#272:1:A>
And then later and later

So that you will uh <,> play uh <,> watching TV

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#274:1:A>
Playing TV games on the bed

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#275:1:A>
Uh <,> after they finished all these things

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#276:1:A>
Uh it is already uh uh <,> uh one o'clock or two o'clock

So they start <,> to study or some <,> sometimes they fell
asleeping

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#278:1:A>
Uh they <,> they just go to sleeping

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X295:1:Z>
Last week was telling me that

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X296:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X297:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#313:1:A>
<[2> Yes

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#314:1:A>
It  ' s true </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#315:1:A>
Uh <,> it is a <,> tradition in a hall also

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X316:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X317:1:Z>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#318:1:B>
Yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X319:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X320:1:Z>
What kind of messages do you put on people  ' s doors </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#321:1:B>
Uh get a good pass in the examination

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X322:1:Z>
Without studying </X> <&> Laughter </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#323:1:B>
Of course you need to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X324:1:Z>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X325:1:Z>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#326:1:B>
<[> Get </[> </{> excellent grade in the examination

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X327:1:Z>
Yeah <&> Somebody-coughs </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X328:1:Z>
Do you when when you find something like that on your door

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X329:1:Z>
Does that really encourage you <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X330:1:Z>
Does it help </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#331:1:B>
A little

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#332:1:B>
But I think uh <,> this also give me some pressure

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#333:1:B>
Because uh <,> if I look at it

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#334:1:B>
Uh <,> I  ' ll think to myself

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#335:1:B>
Will I get a good grade in <{> <[> the examination </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X336:1:Z>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X337:1:Z>
Or maybe that  ' s the purpose of it

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X338:1:Z>
Make you work harder </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#339:1:B>
Perhaps

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X340:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X341:1:Z>
Do you think that will be helpful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X342:1:Z>
For you to don't live in hall <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X343:1:Z>
Now supposing somebody <,> came to your house at night

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X344:1:Z>
And <,> pin something on the door <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X345:1:Z>
<?> To </?> make a difference </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#346:1:D>
I think it  ' s very nice

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#347:1:D>
Uhm <,> if I if I receive uh uh such a paper

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#348:1:D>
Uhm that is uh uhm <&> tut </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#349:1:D>
I think uh uh

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#350:1:D>
To me it is <,> very <,,> encourage

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#351:1:D>
I I I feel very <.> en </.> encourage

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X352:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#353:1:D>
And I will <,> really try try more <,> more hard

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X354:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#355:1:D>
To study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X356:1:Z>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X357:1:Z>
<{> <[> What about you </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#358:1:C>
<[> Yeah I think </[> </{> it may help

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#359:1:C>
Because uh <,> when you see the <,> paper

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#360:1:C>
It will remind you to study now

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#361:1:C>
And uh <,> little pressure is good for <,> everyone <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#362:1:C>
To to force you to study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X363:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#364:1:C>
And uhm <,> when you look at the paper

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#365:1:C>
You <,> you may think that someone is supporting you

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#366:1:C>
And you have the power to go on and go

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X367:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X368:1:Z>
Do you do you think there  ' s too much pressure in Hong Kong for
<,> education </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#369:1:C>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#370:1:C>
I think uhm <,> there  ' s <,> many examination

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#371:1:C>
That you have to pass

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#372:1:C>
And <,> and that  ' s too many student uh <,> to apply uh the places
in uh <,> college

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X373:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#374:1:C>
Uh <,> you have to fight for the <,> examinations

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X375:1:Z>
But <,> but you four

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X376:1:Z>
And you were successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X377:1:Z>
Cos you  ' re here now

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X378:1:Z>
So does that make you think it  ' s a good system <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X379:1:Z>
Or bad system </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#380:1:C>
Uhm <,,> I don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#381:1:C>
It is the <,> it is a good or bad system

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#382:1:C>
But I think it <unc> one-word </unc> <,> it is uhm <,> the
most <,> the best one at present

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#383:1:C>
Because <,> before you haven't got a better one

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#384:1:C>
You have to uh take this one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X385:1:Z>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X386:1:Z>
Easy for you to say

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X387:1:Z>
Because you  ' ve survived <,> the system

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X388:1:Z>
What about the people who aren't successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X389:1:Z>
Do you think <,> unfair on them </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#390:1:C>
Uhm <,,> they may <,,> they may good at other skills

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#391:1:C>
Or <,> other aspects

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#392:1:C>
They don't know

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#393:1:C>
So they have to uh <,> find out

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X394:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#395:1:C>
Give chances to them to find out

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X396:1:Z>
Do you agree with that </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#397:1:A>
Uhm <,> I agree that this system is uhm <,> it  ' s OK

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#398:1:A>
Uhm for those who can't successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#399:1:A>
Uhm <,> there are <,> also many choices for them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#400:1:A>
For example uhm <,> some cannot go to the university or other <,>
Polytechnic

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#401:1:A>
They can uh <,> apply for the uh <,> diploma courses

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#402:1:A>
Uh courses in <,> <.> universal </.> uh in the Polytechinc

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#403:1:A>
Or they can go to other uhm <,> uh industrial <,> institution

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#404:1:A>
Something like <{> <[> that </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X405:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> </X> <&> A fairly long pause then laughter </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#406:1:B>
What

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X407:1:Z>
I just wonder what you thought about it

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X408:1:Z>
You  ' ve been successful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X409:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X410:1:Z>
You  ' ve gone through Hong Kong school <{> <[> passed those exams
</[> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#411:1:B>
<[> I think we are the lucky </[> </{> one

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X412:1:Z>
Uh ha </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#413:1:B>
Because someone uh maybe doing best <,> better than me

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#414:1:B>
In some fields

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#415:1:B>
But they don't get to the <,> tertiary education

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X416:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X417:1:Z>
Why  ' s that </X> <&> Noises </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#418:1:B>
Because they don't like to studies uh science or <,> art

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#419:1:B>
In the uh Form four or Form five level

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#420:1:B>
Then

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#421:1:B>
The door is close for them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#422:1:B>
Uh <,> to further their study

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#423:1:B>
I think it  ' s quite unfortunate

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X424:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X425:1:Z>
uUm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X426:1:Z>
What about <,> the system from now onwards

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X427:1:Z>
You  ' ve been successful so far

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X428:1:Z>
Do you think it gets easier or harder or <,> no change </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#429:1:B>
Easier for

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X430:1:Z>
For you now </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#431:1:B>
For me to

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X432:1:Z>
Now you  ' ve entered the university

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X433:1:Z>
<{> <[> Is </[> it gonna be easier or harder </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#434:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#435:1:B>
Uh <,> easier than <,> the people before me

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X436:1:Z>
No

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X437:1:Z>
I mean easier than before you came here

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X438:1:Z>
Easier when you were at school <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X439:1:Z>
<{> <[> Easier </[> than when you were at school </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#440:1:B>
<[> Uh <,> <unc> a few words </unc> </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#441:1:B>
Because uh <,> places are <,> uh <,> uh more <unc> one word
</unc> more available

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#442:1:B>
Than before

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X443:1:Z>
Uh OK

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X444:1:Z>
What I what I really mean is <,> that <,> you  ' ve been through
the <,> secondary school system and you say that  ' s quite hard

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X445:1:Z>
Now that you  ' ve got into the tertiary system do you think that  ' s
easier <,,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X446:1:Z>
The university

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X447:1:Z>
Is it is it easier than at school </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#448:1:B>
Education system

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X449:1:Z>
Uhm </X> <&> A fairly long pause </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#450:1:B>
I think if you are <,> trying to study something <,> uh <,>
in the university the university is try to give you some <,> very <,,>
sophisticated things about the <,> about the <,> about the subject you study

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#451:1:B>
So uh <,> the education will not be easy for you but the most
important thing is that you need to have some interest in your field

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X452:1:Z>
Uhm <&> A fairly long pause </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X453:1:Z>
Do you agree with that Tellus

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X454:1:Z>
I mean I <,> I  ' ve heard a lot of students saying the hard thing
is to get into university

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X455:1:Z>
Once you  ' re here it  ' s easy </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#456:1:A>
Uhm <,> Sometimes the examination need uh <,> we need some
luck to go to university I think

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X457:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#458:1:A>
Uh ha

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#459:1:A>
Examination is <.> ver </.> uh uh your <,> abilities very
important but uh <,> you must include some <,> uh lucky I <{> <[> think </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X460:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X461:1:Z>
Which bits do you think are down to luck <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X462:1:Z>
What what elements do you think are involved with luck </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#463:1:A>
Uh for example how you choose yours uh your <,> subjects uh
at the <.> A </.>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#464:1:A>
It  ' s your priority of your subject

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#465:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#466:1:A>
Uh sometimes uh <,> if you think you are <,> good enough you
can choose a <,> better or <,> uh <,> for example Engineering or Architecture
or <.> dam </.> uh Medicine <{1> <[1> <,> </[1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#467:1:A>
But <,> if you  ' re not <,> uh so <,> outstanding then you must
choose uh some subject such as Science <,> or Arts <{2> <[2> or </[2> uh <,>
that uh something likes Arts or Science

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#468:1:B>
<[1> Uhm uhm </[1> </{1>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X469:1:Z>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2> </X>

<[> Uhm </[> </{> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#472:1:A>
But if you don't know what is your places uhm then you choose

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#473:1:A>
For example I  ' m not <,> in fact I  ' m not very good in academic
result but uh so I choose Science because it is easier for me to <,> enter
the university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X474:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#475:1:A>
If I choose Medicine or if I choose Engineering as my <,>
first choice or <,> <?> and then </?> over the twenty choices I  ' ve choose
all of them

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#476:1:A>
<?> It  ' s </?> Engineering <,> subjects

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#477:1:A>
Then I think I can't go into the university

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X478:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X479:1:Z>
Is that <,> true about your <,> academic results

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X480:1:Z>
Or you  ' re just being modest </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#481:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X482:1:Z>
Are you just being modest </X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X487:1:Z>
Is it true that your <,> results are not very good

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X488:1:Z>
<{> <[> Or you  ' re </[> too <,> uh you don't want to <,> to tell

<{> <[> OK </[> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#494:1:A>
<[> I </[> </{> I can foresee this <{1> <[1> uh </[1> <,>
problems so I choose <,> Science

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#495:1:A>
<{2> <[2> As </[2> my <,> few uh <,> uh first uh <,> I think I
think uh it  ' s about the choice of number five

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X496:1:Z>
<[1> Mm mm </[1> </{1>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X497:1:Z>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X498:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X499:1:Z>
If you could <,> choose anything at all <{> <[> <,> </[> what
would you choose </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#500:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#501:1:A>
I I will choose Social Science subjects

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X502:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X503:1:Z>
OK

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X504:1:Z>
That  ' s harder than Science </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#505:1:A>
Uh <,> the criterias

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X506:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X507:1:Z>
It  ' s harder to get a place </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#508:1:A>
Uhm

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X509:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X510:1:Z>
I saw Jachin laughing when you were talking about <,> you know
making choices of subjects

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X511:1:Z>
Why was that </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#512:1:D>
Uhm <,> I don't think so

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#513:1:D>
Uh <,> Science is uh <,> uh is comparatively uhm maybe uhm <,>
much <,> much uhm <,> easier uh to get <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#514:1:D>
Mm I think Science <,> is is uh <,> is a topic of <?> richness
</?>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#515:1:D>
Very wonderful

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#516:1:D>
And <,> I think that it should not be <,> be pull down

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X517:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#518:1:D>
And <&> tut </&> <&> A fairly long pause </&>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X519:1:Z>
Why did you choose Science </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#520:1:D>
Uhm <,> it  ' s my interest

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X521:1:Z>
Uhm so for you it  ' s not a question of academic results </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#522:1:D>
Uh <,> it also depends but uh <,> the proportion is not that
much

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X523:1:Z>
Uhm <,> when you said Science is wonderful I saw Yvonne smiling

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X524:1:Z>
Why do you smile at that </X> <&> Laughter </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#525:1:C>
Uhm <,> in my case I also uh <,> didn't done well in my
academic results uhm but it  ' s not the reason for me to choose Science

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X526:1:Z>
Uhm uhm </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#527:1:C>
Actually the first <.> choi </.> <,> my first choice is
Social Science and <,> and Science is my second choice

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#528:1:C>
Uhm <,> I think uh Science is <,> is interesting because I  ' ve
studied that for <,> four or five years and uh <,> and I think <,> if I <,,>
if I were <,> uh sent to the Medicine uh or other faculty I wouldn't done
well because I don't have <,> this uh ability

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#529:1:C>
<{1> <[> Also </[> I think I  ' m <,> I don't have this ability

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X530:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X531:1:Z>
Yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#532:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{> you mean you have ability to done good in uh
to do good in Science

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X533:1:Z>
<{> <[> Uhm </[> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#534:1:C>
Uhm <,,> yeah more chances

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#535:1:A>
More chances

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#536:1:D>
And I think uh <,> undergraduate studies uh is uh provide
provide answer to <?> and also uh </?> is clear answer uh to learn something
to uh <,> the skill

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#537:1:D>
<unc> three words </unc> uh <,> have the skill to learn
something

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#538:1:D>
It  ' s the fundamental studies

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#539:1:D>
Uhm <,> the <unc> one word </unc> is not important uh <,>
to <,> uhm <,> to look at uh <,> which subject of one  ' s <,> which which
which subject of uh one study

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X540:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#541:1:D>
I think it  ' s general education

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X542:1:Z>
OK </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#543:1:D>
Just train one <,>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#544:1:D>
Just to train one uh how to think uh <,> his mind

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#545:1:D>
Something like that

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X546:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X547:1:Z>
It  ' s an important skill

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X548:1:Z>
Right </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#549:1:D>
<{> <[> Uhm </[>

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X550:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> if you have the chance <,> to change would you
change </X> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#551:1:A>
I have consider this uh <,> at the beginning of <,> this
semester

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X552:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#553:1:A>
Uhm uh <,> I  ' ve talk to some hallmates which is studying
Social Work

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#554:1:A>
Because Social Work is my favourite choice uhm <,> they suggest to
me that uhm <,> if you wish to <,> uh change your subjects you <,> can uh <,>
first done well uh do it well in this year and get excellent result and then
change and or you do very well in this uh coming three year and then you
study postgraduate  ' s uh studies in Social Work

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X555:1:Z>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#556:1:A>
Uh when I heard it I <,> I think I will choose the uh <,,> uh
the second one

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#557:1:A>
It means uh I  ' ll study hard in this three year

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#558:1:A>
And then uh <,> if I  ' ve got <,> uh good result I will uh consider
to uh <.> post </.> <?> and uh </?> to <,> enter the postgraduate studies

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X559:1:Z>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X560:1:Z>
In Social Science

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X561:1:Z>

Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X564:1:Z>
OK

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X565:1:Z>
Here  ' s my final question

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X566:1:Z>
What are you going to do when you graduate <,> aprt from
celebrate <&> Laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X567:1:Z>
What are you going to do afterwards </X> <&> A fairly long pause
</&>

<$C> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#568:1:C>
Uh I think I will have further studies bcause I will study in
food and nutritional

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#569:1:C>
Uhm at least I <,> I think I <,,> to have uhm uhm <,> to study to
master because <,> then I  ' ll get a job <{> <[> in </[> hospital or <,,> or
<,> other <,> uh <,> uh <,> company

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X570:1:Z>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X571:1:Z>
Uhm </X> <&> A fairly long pause </&>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#572:1:D>
I think I will be a teacher

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#573:1:D>
Uhm <,> it  ' s my <,> it  ' s my <,> it  ' s my hope

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#574:1:D>
I want to be a teacher because <,> uhm <,> I want to be a good

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X577:1:Z>
Uhm

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X578:1:Z>
Uh <,> it  ' s <,> that  ' s a good wish

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X579:1:Z>
How are you going to know if you  ' re a good teacher </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#580:1:D>
Uhm <,> I think uhm from the feedback of the student you can
<,> you can know uh <,> uh uh you are you are you are doing something uh very
good or not

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X581:1:Z>
Yeah

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X582:1:Z>
I hope you  ' re right

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X583:1:Z>
I think <,> I think when you get there you  ' ll find it  ' s <,> it  ' s
more difficult than you think it is to understand the feedback but yeah uh I
think it  ' s a good wish

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X584:1:Z>
What about you </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#585:1:A>
When I was a secondary student I wish to become a social
worker but when I enter this university I know that <,> uh I must study three
years for Physics

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#586:1:A>
And then <,> uh <,> if my result is good uh <,> then I <,> can
have a chance to uh study postgraduate in Social Work

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#587:1:A>
And then I will be a social worker

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#588:1:A>
But at this moment I can't uh <,> I can't foresee what is my
future here

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X589:1:Z>
Right

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X590:1:Z>
But if you can

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X591:1:Z>
You wanna <,> go into postgraduate work </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#592:1:A>
Uhm

What about you Jimmy </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-HK:S1A-060#595:1:B>
Uh <,> I <,> I think the question is <,> uh <,> still not
quite <,> not quite sure for me to answer <,> because I <,> I  ' ve been in the
university for nearly <,> one year uh something is <,> changing <unc> one
word </unc> even my interest uh my character and other things

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#596:1:B>
But uh if you ask me now uh how would I <?> gonna </?> to do in
the future I think <,> I would like to <,> uh be a postgraduate in my <,> in
my subject yes

<$Z> <X>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X597:1:Z>
I laughed when you said that because you paused after post and I
thought you  ' re going to say postman <&> Laughter </&>

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X598:1:Z>
I  ' d like to be a postman

<ICE-HK:S1A-060#X599:1:Z>
Seems to bit of a waste <&> Laughter </&> </X> </I>
