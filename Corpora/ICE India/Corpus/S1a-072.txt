<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#1:1:A>
Hello Chandrakala <,> how are you <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#2:1:B>
Fine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#3:1:B>
And how are you

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#4:1:B>
You seem to be quite lethargic <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#5:1:A>
Oh it is because <,> uh one of our friends here <,> invited me
for this <,> uh lunch you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#6:1:A>
Uh I had a <indig> puran poli </indig> <,> and perhaps it has its
effect <,,> <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#7:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> why <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#8:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#9:1:B>
And I think uh <,> <w> that's </w> a <,> favourite dish or <,>
if they invite any guests or <,> anyone <,,> <.> the </.> these are few
things that they <,> serve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#10:1:B>
<w> It's </w> <indig> puran poli </indig> or <indig> jilabi
</indig> <,> or <indig> gulab jamun </indig> that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#11:1:A>
Oh <,> for eating they are a very tasty but uh <,> sometimes
no they will <{> <-> affects </-> <+> affert </+> </{> our health <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#12:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#13:1:B>
No don't you think that <,> uh uh about this food and food habits
and all <,,> <w> that's </w> <,> these <{> <-> differs </-> <+> differ </+>
</{> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#14:1:B>
Now but we are saying <,> you are not used to <indig> puran poli
</indig> maybe <w> that's </w> why you are feeling that is very heavy and
lethargic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#15:1:B>
But these food habits they differ from country to country

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#16:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#17:1:B>
Generation to generation <,> state to state <,> family even
the individual <,,> each <{> <[> individual </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#18:1:A>
<[> It depends </[> </{> it depends <{> <-> of </-> <=> on
</=> </{> <w> one's </w> likings and dislikings

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#19:1:A>
That is also there <,> and it may be due to climate also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#20:1:B>
Yeah and you are not used to all this food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#21:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#22:1:B>
Maybe <w> that's </w> why you are feeling lethargic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#23:1:B>
And <,> what else do you think about the food habits over here <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#24:1:A>
Here <,> usually what happens no <,> in your area <,,> most of
the people they will have <,> that <indig> jowar </indig> <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>
for their food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#25:1:A>
And uh <,> in <,> Bangalore or Mysore they will have rice <{> <[>
as a </[> plain food

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#26:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#27:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#28:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> true

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#29:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#30:1:B>
In north <,> and west <,> all these northerners westerners <,>
they prefer wheat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#31:1:B>
Then <,,> from the north or <,> people who <-> will </-> belong to
east for example <,> Calcutta and all <,,> they prefer <,> they like to have
<,> rice

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#32:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#33:1:B>
<w> That's </w> the staple diet there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#34:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#35:1:B>
But now don't you feel that uh <,> previously it so happened
<,> that <,> those who belong to east or south east they used to <,> prefer
rice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#36:1:B>
Those who belong to north and west all <,> mostly they prefer wheat
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#37:1:B>
But now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of
life <,,> due to studies maybe <,> or you can say <,> for <,> their business
<,> or service <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#38:1:B>
And now <,> all are familiar with all types of food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#39:1:A>
Yeah they are <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#40:1:A>
And gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#41:1:A>
When one will begin to live in that particular <{> <[> area </[>
<,> automatically they will be accustomed to that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#42:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#43:1:B>
But one difference what I find is <,> that in this generation
maybe it is the influence of <,> the T V as the <?> mass </?> media <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#44:1:B>
This young generation the young persons <,> they are so used to
this <,> or may be they don't have so much time at their disposal now <,>
they <{> <[> want readymade </[> food <,> so they go for junk food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#45:1:A>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#46:1:A>
Oh <,> readymade

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#47:1:B>
The fast food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#48:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#49:1:B>
The canned food <,> all that <,> don't you think so <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#50:1:A>
Yes it is there but uh <,> directly they will be affected by

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#51:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> <w> that's </w> there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#52:1:A>
The other one

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#53:1:B>
As <,> we Indians feel that they are three types <,> isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#54:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#55:1:B>
<indig> Satvik rajsik </indig> and <indig> tamsik </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#56:1:A>
Uhm but uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#57:1:B>
And what we feel <,> that <indig> satvik </indig> food that is
the best

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#58:1:A>
Ah see here no in uh <,> Karmungra there is <O> one word </O>
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#59:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#60:1:A>
And uh <,> that uh <,> the <O> one word </O> has given the
opinions about uh <,> the persons uh <,> above eighty years old

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#61:1:B>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#62:1:A>
And uh really if we read it no <,> uh I feel that vegetarian
food and uh <,> that <indig> satvik </indig> what you called <,> <indig>
satvik </indig> food no <,> that will be very good to health

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#63:1:B>
<w> That's </w>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#64:1:A>
And <,> this is the secret of their health uh <{> <[> in the
</[> opinion of many persons like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#65:1:B>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#66:1:B>
Yeah <,> actually as a matter of fact <,,> we should say that
<,> some people eat to live some live to eat <,> <O> laughs </O> no even we
go for that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#67:1:B>
Then as a matter of fact <,> uh what I feel is <,> that sprouted
<,> or fibrous <,> nutrious salad <,> and fresh food is a must for good
health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#68:1:B>
What I feel is <,> that food and food habit <,> do affect our mind
<,> thought

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#69:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#70:1:B>
Actions <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#71:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#72:1:B>
Our physique <,> everything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#73:1:B>
Because just see <,> when we eat uh <,> this person have said <,>
who eat very <,> hot or spicy food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#74:1:A>
Uhn they will be short tempered <,> very <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#75:1:B>
Uhn they depend <{> <[> <O> one word </O> in sense </[> yeah
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#76:1:A>
<[> There is an assumption </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#77:1:B>
And what I feel the food that we eat <,> that affects our
physique also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#78:1:B>
Because uh <,> one can get if you eat very hot <,,> this all this
fried things and all <,> one is you <,> put on weight

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#79:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#80:1:B>
Another thing the cholestrol level also <,> goes up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#81:1:B>
So there is possibility of <,> heart attack <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#82:1:B>
Then those who have blood pressures and gasterol

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#83:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#84:1:B>
Eat less of uh <,> sugar uh sorry <,> salt <,> those who are
diabetes <,> they are told to eat less <,> sugar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#85:1:B>
So all these people they are so habituated <w> it's </w> very
difficult <,> but uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#86:1:A>
But what I feel no <,,> uh we people will begin to think up
all these effects only when uh <,> we will be <{> <[> suffering from </[>
some disease and all <,> but uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#87:1:B>
<[> Suffering yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#88:1:B>
But prevention is better than cure

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#89:1:A>
Yeah that is there but uh <,> most of the people no <,> they
will eat what they like <,> even it is not good for health

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#90:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#91:1:A>
They will not care about the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#92:1:B>
Least bothered about

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#93:1:A>
But <,> when doctor suggested something then will go on <,>
taking some <{> <-> precaution </-> <=> precautions </=> </{> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#94:1:B>
Actually

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#95:1:A>
As a matter of fact the best thing is <,> to have a balanced
diet <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#96:1:B>
And what I feel is again about food habit like this <,>
talking food food habits enough

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#97:1:A>
Yeah <O> laughs </O> still <,> though <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#98:1:B>
What you feel <w> I'm </w> used to all types of food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#99:1:B>
But still there is a difference <O> one word </O> food of diferent
states <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#100:1:B>
For example if you go to Calcutta <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#101:1:B>
Now in Calcutta what you find <,> the accent the intonation the
articulation the food <,> the food habits <,> <w> it's </w> something quite
differnt from south <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#102:1:B>
There what you find is <,> instead of saying Amar <,> <w> they'll
</w> say Amor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#103:1:B>
Instead of saying <indig> wa </indig> <,> they say <indig> ba
</indig>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#104:1:B>
For example for Shivani they will Shibani <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#105:1:B>
Ravindranath <,> they will say Rabindranath <,> like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#106:1:B>
About the eating habit also <,> they prefer the cheese

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#107:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#108:1:B>
Cheese <,> fish <,> all that flavour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#109:1:B>
Then <,> for Rajasthan again <,> I would like to tell <,> that <,>
as I <,> belong to Bikaner <,> I would like to say that <,> there <,> we
don't have fresh vegetables and <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#110:1:B>
So mostly we used to have that <indig> samari <,> churmur <,> daal
batti <,> gatta <,> papad </indig> <,,> all these things <indig> ghee bhat
</indig> <O> a few words </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#111:1:A>
Which food <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#112:1:B>
<O> One word </O> <,> I think <,> I presume you are coming
from Karnatak

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#113:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#114:1:B>
Let us know something <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#115:1:A>
Uh you know <,> in Karnataka no <,> usually people will
prefer <,> that <indig> roti </indig> what <w> we'll </w> call <indig> roti
</indig> <w> it's </w> prepared of <indig> jowar </indig> <,> and <indig>
chapati </indig> rarely once in a week <,> they will do it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#116:1:A>
Then rice <,> curry

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#117:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#118:1:A>
And they prefer more <,> buttermilk <,> milk <indig> ghee
</indig> <,> not so much butter <,> but they like <indig> ghee </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#119:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#120:1:A>
In hot rice they like it <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#121:1:B>
Uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#122:1:A>
In uh <,> Mysore no they will prefer <indig> idli dosa
</indig> <,> then rice

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#123:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#124:1:A>
Perhaps <,> they can live months together without bread <,>
but we people here no <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> in Belgaum district one of <O> two
words </O> we can't live without bread <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#125:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#126:1:B>
I must confess though I don't belong to south but still I too
am fond of <indig> idli dosa </indig> <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#127:1:B>
I must say <w> it's </w> very <,> uh it is easy easy to digest
these things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#128:1:B>
Then what we have in <O> one word </O> and eat something else for
food <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#129:1:A>
But I feel <,> that uh <,,> <indig> <.> ro </.> roti </indig>
prepared out of <indig> jowar </indig> no and rice <,> it is better than
<indig> idli </indig> and <indig> dosa </indig> a day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#130:1:A>
It will be <,> it will be affecting our health

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#131:1:B>
I feel <,> irrespective of all these things some <O> one word
</O> is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#132:1:B>
Whatever we eat <,,> whatever the food or food habits are <,> we
should try to develop such habits

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#133:1:A>
Uh for example what they are <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#134:1:B>
The fresh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#135:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#136:1:B>
Ones a balanced diet <,> and extra good one salad <O> one
word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#137:1:A>
It should be nutrious

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#138:1:B>
Whatever it is <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#139:1:A>
But don't you think that <,> uh our <.> ances </.> our own
people no <,> our elders <,> uh they used to use turmeric <,> or spices

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#140:1:B>
Uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#141:1:A>
But uh even for using spices there must be some reason

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#142:1:B>
It it had <indig> na </indig> that it has did have <O> two
words </O> besides having some taste <,> it did add to the taste and colour
of the food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#143:1:B>
But it had medicinal medicinal powers also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#144:1:B>
For example turmeric

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#145:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#146:1:B>
A very good anticeptic <,> or asofoetida <,> that also helps
to have stomach <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#147:1:A>
Then garlic <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#148:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> garlic is there <,> these things too
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#149:1:A>
But the colours that we uh <,> we use in uh <,> preparations
no <,> it is very injurious to health

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#150:1:A>
But inspite of all that we use it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#151:1:B>
Uhn <?> permitted </?> colours <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#152:1:A>
Yeah <,> <O> one word </O> so they are <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#153:1:B>
And I think <,> whatever the food that we eat <,> it depends
on the <,> like the place where <w> we're </w> staying <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#154:1:B>
The state also where it all these things grow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#155:1:B>
Wherever paddy grows obviously people will have <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> no <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#156:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#157:1:B>
Then about the timings also I would like to <{> <[> say </[>
about these habits <,> like in every family what you find is <,> they have a
different schedule <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#158:1:A>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#159:1:A>
Obviously <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#160:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> better you know <,> in evening <O> one word
</O> if you eat <,> early <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#161:1:B>
In the morning also you should try to eat earlier <,> in the night
also if you eat <,> and whatever you eat at night <,> that should be quite
light

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#162:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#163:1:B>
Not very <,> heavy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#164:1:B>
Now many people they are used to accustomed to eat <,> very heavy
food at night <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#165:1:B>
That also affects the digestion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#166:1:B>
<w> It's </w> better to have light food at night <,> and uh <,>
everyday in the morning <w> that's </w> very important

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#167:1:A>
Yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#168:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#169:1:A>
Then <,> after all what are your <,> food habits <,,> firstly
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#170:1:B>
By the way <,> doing a lecture in a <O> two words </O> the
college timing <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#171:1:B>
In the morning <,> I go just with <,> glass of milk <,> <{> <[>
uhn <,> or even a bit of bournvita <,> and <,> snacks or so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#172:1:B>
And what we have is <,> <indig> tikla </indig> prepared of <,>
wheat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#173:1:B>
As a matter of fact <,> a sort of <,> biscuit <,,> but <w> it's
</w> <,> shallow fried <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#174:1:B>
Then <,> I I come at eleven <w> O'clock </w> <,> that depends on
the classes <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#175:1:B>
When I return <,> I have my lunch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#176:1:B>
Now lunch comprises of <,> what our habit is or you know say <,> a
personal <O> one word </O> in our family <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#177:1:B>
We have <,> rice <indig> daal <,> chapati curry </indig> <,>
little bit of <O> one word </O> <,> <O> one word </O> all this <O> a few
words </O> and all <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#178:1:A>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#179:1:A>
Oh god <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#180:1:B>
Pickles sometimes <,> that <O> one word </O> <O> laughs </O>
though <,> especially I shouldn't eat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#181:1:B>
Uhm then again in the evening <,> we have tea or coffee <O> one
word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#182:1:B>
Then <,> at night also <,> we have a light <,> uh dinner same as
lunch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#183:1:B>
And another thing that people avoid is <,> <w> it's </w> very <w>
it's </w> said that an apple a day <,> keeps the doctor away <O> laughter
</O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#184:1:B>
But what we do many times <,> instead of taking an apple we <,> if
we tell our children <,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,> they are ready to have cadbury <,>
which spoils their teeth also <,> <{2> <[2> uhn <,> and not for food but <,>
fruit should be <,> one of the most important <,,> uh the important <,> uh
food instead of <O> one word </O> <,> that is what I feel

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#185:1:B>
Everyone <,> everyday <,> in any form may be juice <,> or <}> <->
cutted </-> <+> cut </+> </}> pieces <,> or <,,> best thing is to take apple
<,> as it is without cutting it

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#186:1:B>
That is what <,> and fruits also you have <,> in different place
<,> different fruits that you have <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#187:1:B>
But instead of that <,> many people they try <,> instead of milk
they would like to have ice-cream <O> laughter </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#188:1:B>
But you see they don't feel <,> what the <,> effects after effects
or adverse effects they <,> they have <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#189:1:B>
So what do you think what are the fruits that are grown <O> two
words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#190:1:A>
<[1> Uhn </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#191:1:A>
<[2> Uhn </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#192:1:A>
We have banana <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and I I like it very much

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#193:1:A>
Daily I use the <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#194:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#195:1:B>
Another thing what I found <,> find is <,> there are few
things which are common <,> whether you go to east west north south <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#196:1:B>
And <O> one word </O> for you <,> all use <,,> <indig> dal
</indig> of course pulses cereals everybody uses curry everybody uses <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#197:1:B>
Vegetable salad everybody uses <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#198:1:B>
Then in some form or the other <,> milk is used and this food <,>
curd <,> either they put curd <,> or buttermilk at the end <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#199:1:B>
So I think that also helps in digestion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#200:1:B>
<w> That's </w> a good habit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#201:1:B>
What do you think <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#202:1:A>
Yes that is true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#203:1:A>
I too use milk <,> in our area also people prefer buttermilk <,>
more than milk

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#204:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#205:1:A>
I mean the curd <,> and as I told you <indig> ghee </indig>
but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh <,> it is <w> one's
</w> liking they will use it <,,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#206:1:A>
And as far as myself I will have cup of tea in the morning

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#207:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#208:1:A>
Then at nine thirty I will have some light tiffin at <,> one
<w> O'clock </w> <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> <w> I'll </w> have <,> my lunch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#209:1:A>
And usually I prefer green vegetables <,> bread <,> then
buttermilk <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#210:1:A>
Then <,> in the evening <,,> rice only <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#211:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#212:1:B>
<O> One word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#213:1:A>
Uhn <,,> in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening
so after eight thirty or nine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#214:1:A>
Everyday I will have <,> rice <,> then <,> curry <,> then uh <,>
<O> one word </O> when I go to sleep I will have <,> a glass of milk <,> <O>
laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#215:1:B>
What I what I think is <,> that these food habits should be
developed from the time when the children are very young

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#216:1:B>
Then <O> one word </O> <,> all the people in the house should be
<O> one word </O> it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#217:1:B>
Instead of getting them biscuits <,> or chocolates <,> or juice
<,> we should try to give them fruits <O> one word </O> <,> or uh <,>
vegetable <,,> salad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#218:1:B>
So if we develop that taste from the very beginning <,> obviously
<,> they will continue through out their life

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#219:1:B>
And <,> they can have good <,> health physical health

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#220:1:A>
But <,> but now a days what is happening no <,> children <,>
even children are found of <indig> parag </indig> <O> two words </O> and all
these things <O> one word </O> <,> really it will spoil their health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#221:1:A>
And inspite of that <,> the child <,> as soon as it gets up from
the bed no <,> it uh <,> demands for tea only

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#222:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#223:1:A>
And <,> we can leave <,> without food but uh <,> first we
must have a tea

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#224:1:A>
So I really feel <,> it will kill our <,> hunger <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#225:1:B>
Ahn <w> that's </w> true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#226:1:B>
And in the morning also one thing is that <,> <w> that's </w> uh
<,> children <,> they have that habit of taking something <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#227:1:B>
But before that without brushing and all then they go <O> laughter
</O> and <,> if uh <,> they eat anything that is <,> sweet <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#228:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#229:1:B>
As I told <O> a few words </O> anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-072#230:1:B>
So <,,> after that atleast <,,> once they get up <,> and before
going to sleep <,> one should brush the teeth atleast

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-072#231:1:A>
Yeah </I>
