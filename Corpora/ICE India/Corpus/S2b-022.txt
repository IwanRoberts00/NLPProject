<ICE-IND:S2B-022#1:1:A>
Archaeology <,> is said to be concerned with the digging of the  
past <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#2:1:A>
Of its find <,,> coins form an important source of knowledge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#3:1:A>
Indeed <,> several Kings and Chieftains <,> would have remained  
unknown <,> but for the unearthing and study of the coins issued by them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#4:1:A>
Further <,> coins reveal the socio-cultural <,,> economic <,>  
religious <,> and political <,> life of those times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#5:1:A>
And hence the importance of numismatics <,> that is the study of the  
coins to the understanding of our ancient Indian history <,> can not be over  
emphasised <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#6:1:A>
My talk is about ancient Andhra coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#7:1:A>
In the evolution of the ancient Indian coinage <,,> earliest to be  
issued was punch marked coins <,> which was first succeeded by <,,>  
uninscribed cast coins <,> and the later <,> by the inscribed coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#8:1:A>
The punch marked coins were in circulation between eighth and second  
century B C <,,> and these coins were probably in circulation for a little  
longer period in the south India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#9:1:A>
These coins had no dates and no inscription denoting the name of the  
King <,> or the Dynasty to which he belonged <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#10:1:A>
These coins had only symbols <,,> which were marked on them by  
punching technique <,> and hence the name punch mark given to them on the  
basis of the method of their manufacture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#11:1:A>
These are <,> some of the punch marked coins <,,> except one at the  
top which is made of <,,> copper <,,> rest of the coins are made of <,>  
silver <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#12:1:A>
Majority of the punch marked coins <,> are made of silver <,,> and  
very rarely copper and lead <,> was used for making these coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#13:1:A>
The punch marked coins were manufactured by two methods <,,> one is  
the cut-sheet process <,> in which the metal was beaten into flat sheets of  
appropriate thickness and width <,> and then the coin blanks were cut <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#14:1:A>
When the metal <,> was still soft <,> the symbols were marked on  
them using different punches <,,> then the coins were weighed <,> and if they  
are found to be overweight <,> edges were clipped <,> and hence majority of  
the coins ended up being irregular <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#15:1:A>
Round and oval kinds were made by different technique <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#16:1:A>
Weight globules of molten metal were fold into moulds <,,> and then  
were beaten flat <,> and then the symbols were marked on them by punches <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#17:1:A>
Hence the shapes of these coins varied from round <,> oval <,>  
squarish <,> rectangular to <,> irregular <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#18:1:A>
And what you are seeing <,> is the obverse <,> side of <,> the  
coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#19:1:A>
And punchmark coins have only symbols imprinted on them <,> on the  
obverse side <,,> where as the reverse side is always blank <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#20:1:A>
What you are seeing now <,,> is the reverse side of the three of  
the punchmark coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#21:1:A>
This side is <,> blank <,> except for <,> few indistinct <,>  
symbols <,,> which came to be called as the bankers or officials marks <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#22:1:A>
Next let us consider <,> when coins came to be <,> issued for the  
first time in our country <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#23:1:A>
Majority of the numismatists are of the opinion <,,> that coins  
originated somewhere around eighth century B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#24:1:A>
This assumption is based on two kinds of an evidence that we have  
got <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#25:1:A>
One is the archaeological <,> other literary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#26:1:A>
Whenever <,> punchmark coins were found during the excavation <,>  
archaeologists determined the statigraphic level <,> at which these coins  
were found <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#27:1:A>
And next they find out what other material was found associated  
with them <,,> such as the northern black polished <,> and polished gravier  
pottery and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#28:1:A>
These can be dated by radio carbon method <,,> all the available  
archaeological evidence confirms <,> that coins were in circulation in our  
country from fifth century B C and later <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#29:1:A>
But the literary evidence reveals that coins were issued in our  
country <,> much earlier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#30:1:A>
<mention> Arthashastra </mention> of Kautilya <,,> which was  
written in the fourth century B C <,> mentions about punchmark coins <,,>  
<indig> pana </indig> and its fractions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#31:1:A>
It also mentions about ways of detecting counterfeit and forge  
coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#32:1:A>
It is clear that coins were made in India <,> prior to fourth  
century B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#33:1:A>
<mention> Ashtadhyayi </mention> of Panini <,> was said to be  
written in the fifth or sixth century B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#34:1:A>
It also clearly mentions about various types of coins <,> like  
<indig> pana <,> nishka </indig> and <indig> satamana </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#35:1:A>
Hence it is clear <,> that coins were in circulation prior to sixth  
century B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#36:1:A>
The earliest literary evidence <,> that probably suggests about  
coins <,,> is <mention> Maitraini Samhita of Yajurveda </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#37:1:A>
This text is said to be written <,,> somewhere around thousand B C  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#38:1:A>
There is a particular reference <,> in this text about a lump of  
precious metal <,,> which some scholars feel that it was referring to coin  
<indig> satmana </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#39:1:A>
But not all scholars are agreed on this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#40:1:A>
From the literary evidence <,> one could not be certain about the  
exact period <,,> when coins came to be first issued in our country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#41:1:A>
But the consensus seems to favour <,> eighth century B C as the  
most likely date <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#42:1:A>
Next I will say few words about the symbols that are found <,> on  
the coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#43:1:A>
No less than three hundred different symbols <,,> were recorded on  
punchmark coins alone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#44:1:A>
The symbols on the coins <,> probably represent the king <,,> his  
dynasty <,,> the kingdom <,,> the capital city <,> main town and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#45:1:A>
But at these length of time <,,> one could never be certain <,>  
that what each symbol represented <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#46:1:A>
Roughly <,> these three hundred symbols can be grouped into six  
broad catagories <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#47:1:A>
First <,,> depiction of human figure either occuring singly or in  
groups <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#48:1:A>
Second group consists of animal symbols <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#49:1:A>
Four common animals depicted are the elephant <,> bull <,> horse  
and lamb <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#50:1:A>
Other animals seen are the camel <,> rhinosorous dog <,> bear <,>  
peacock <,> reptiles <,> fish <,> frog and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#51:1:A>
Third group consists of implements such as bow and arrow <,,>  
ladder <,,> and ship <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#52:1:A>
Fourth group consists of trees <,> and flowers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#53:1:A>
Fifth group consists of astral and religious symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#54:1:A>
Last group consists of miscellanious <,,> symbols including Ujjain  
<,> and six arm <,> symbol and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#55:1:A>
One general observation that can be made <,> here is that <,> the  
animal symbols are much more common in early series of punchmark coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#56:1:A>
Whereas the hill symbol occurs commonly <,> in later coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#57:1:A>
There are two main types of punchmark coins <,> local and imperial  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#58:1:A>
During eighth to sixth century B C <,> our country consisted of  
many tribal states <,> or <indig> janapadas </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#59:1:A>
Local rulers of these states have issued coins for circulation in  
the respective regions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#60:1:A>
Magadha too started as a small tribal state with Rajgir in Bihar as  
the capital <,> but later <,> this state has become very powerful <,> it  
expanded its territories <,> then shifted its capital to Patna or Patilaputra  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#61:1:A>
And by the time <,> this state <,> came under the rule of Nanda and  
Mauryan dynasties <,> almost the entire country <,> was under their rule <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#62:1:A>
And coins issued by these dynasties <,> were in circulation  
throughout the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#63:1:A>
And these coins came to be called as imperial coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#64:1:A>
Both type of these coins <,> local as well as the imperial <,>  
punchmark coins have very distinctive features <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#65:1:A>
Local coins or the early coins <,> and naturally <,> they are very  
rare to find <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#66:1:A>
They were of crude design and fabric <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#67:1:A>
The symbols marked on these coins too are crude <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#68:1:A>
Weights of these coins too varied from one gram to over twenty  
grams <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#69:1:A>
The number of symbols on the obverse <,> were usually one or two  
<,> but never exceeded four <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#70:1:A>
In contrast <,,> imperial coins <,> were of uniform weight of three  
point four grams or fifty-four grams in fresh mint condition <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#71:1:A>
Obverse had only five symbols <,> and the reverse was blank except  
for bankers marks <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#72:1:A>
Occasionally these coins had counter marks of subsequent rulers  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#73:1:A>
Out of the five symbols <,,> two symbols were common <,> to all  
these coins <,,> that is <,> sun and the six armed symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#74:1:A>
Hence they are called as the first and second symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#75:1:A>
Third fourth and fifth symbols were from any <,> of the three  
hundred and odd symbols found on the punchmark coins <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#76:1:A>
These are called as the class group and variety symbols <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#77:1:A>
What you are seeing now are the drawings of the symbols depicted on  
the obverse side of the two punchmark coins <,,> sun and six armed symbols  
are common to both these coins <,> though the design of the six armed symbol  
does vary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#78:1:A>
One has four arrow marks <,> whereas the second one has three  
arrows <,> and three dot symbols marked inside the triangle <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#79:1:A>
Third symbol on one coin is the <,> <O> one word </O> <,> whereas  
the tree and railing symbol with fish below is seen on the second coin <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#80:1:A>
Fourth symbol on one coin consists of the four fish symbols <,>  
around a square with a dot inside <,> all enclosed inside a large square <,>  
whereas <indig> ankusha <,> thareen </indig> and straight line are seen on  
the other coin <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#81:1:A>
Elephant forms the fifth symbol on both these coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#82:1:A>
One coin belongs to one variety <,> whereas the second forms  
another variety <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#83:1:A>
Six hundred such varieties of punchmark coins have so far been  
described <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#84:1:A>
I will now show you <,> the various designs of sun symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#85:1:A>
Sun is depicted <,> with varying number of rays varying from twelve  
to eighteen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#86:1:A>
In early coins rays are shown as oblique <,> whereas in subsequent  
coins they are seen as radial <,> or straight or horizontal lines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#87:1:A>
The second symbol came to be known as the six armed symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#88:1:A>
This symbol consists of a dot or a circle <,> around which six  
symbols are marked <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#89:1:A>
These could be either six arrows <,> three arrows <,> and three  
other symbols <,> which may vary from fish <,,> oval <,> rectangle <,> tureen  
or any other kind of a design <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#90:1:A>
Ninety different types of the six armed symbols <,> have been <,>  
found on the punchmark coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#91:1:A>
One more common symbol <,> in later punchmark coins is the tree and  
railing <,> various designs of which are shown in this chart <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#92:1:A>
Another common symbol is the hill symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#93:1:A>
This is depicted <,> as either showing three arches <,,> or arches  
vary from anywhere from five to ten <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#94:1:A>
But three arched hill <,> with a crescent at top <,> is considered  
to be the Ashokan or late Mauryan symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#95:1:A>
I will briefly <,,> tell you about the characteristic features of  
the local and imperial punchmark coins <,> that were found in Andhra region  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#96:1:A>
When it comes to the local punchmark coins <,,> one interesting  
observation was that <,> all these coins were made of lead <,,> and the  
weights of this coins too varied to from one gram to over fifteen grams <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#97:1:A>
The make of this coins too <,> was somewhat cruder <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#98:1:A>
But as for the symbols various symbols were found on them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#99:1:A>
But three common symbols that were there on these coins was a  
crudely designed sun symbol with lesser number of rays <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#100:1:A>
Second <indig> chakra </indig> or a wheel symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#101:1:A>
Thirdly <,> a crude design of a branch <,> with leaves <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#102:1:A>
These were the features of the <,,> early local Andhra coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#103:1:A>
When it comes to the imperial punchmark coins that were found  
exclusively in Andhra region <,> I would like to mention about the Amravati  
hoard of the punchmark coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#104:1:A>
There were no less than seven thousand six hundred <,,> punchmark  
coins found at this site <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#105:1:A>
It had two hundred and eighty-four symbols on them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#106:1:A>
Two hundred and thirty-five varieties of punchmark imperial coins  
<,,> were found in this hoard <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#107:1:A>
But what was interesting was that <,> forty-eight varieties <,> of  
this kind of a <,,> punchmark coins were only found <,> in Andhra region <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#108:1:A>
This means that even though <,,> punchmark coins of the imperial  
type <,,> of uniform weight and size with common symbols <,> were there  
throughout the country <,> but certain varieties were exclusively minted in  
each region <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#109:1:A>
The second series of coins <,,> which were issued in our country  
after the punchmark coins <,> were the uninscribed cast coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#110:1:A>
These coins were in circulation <,> between sixth to the third  
century B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#111:1:A>
In some parts of our country <,> these coins were the first to be  
issued <,> and not the punchmark coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#112:1:A>
In the rest of the country <,> these coins were exclusively made  
of copper <,> and hence the name uninscribed cast coins <,,> was applied to  
them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#113:1:A>
But majority of the coins <,,> which were issued in Andhra region  
<,> were made of lead <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#114:1:A>
Even though these coins had various symbols <,> four common  
symbols that were found on these coins are the <indig> hollowcross <,> tarin  
<,> swastika </indig> <,> and the </indig> <O> one or two words </O> <indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#115:1:A>
Surprisingly the <indig> hollowcross </indig> <,> which was <,,>  
very common in the uninscribed coins of this period <,> does not figure on  
the coins <,> which was issued immediately after <,> that is on the inscribed  
coins which was issued <,> in this part of the country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#116:1:A>
Seventy new types of previously <}> <-> undescribed </-> <=>  
uninscribed </=> </}> coins found in Andhra region <,> were discussed in our  
book <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#117:1:A>
One message <,,> that comes through from this study is that though  
this region <,,> was under the Nanda and Mauryan empire <,> still there were  
local rulers or authorities who issued a variety of such coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#118:1:A>
Another important <,> fact <,> to be noticed is that <,> with the  
introduction of uninscribed cast coins <,> symbols came to be marked on  
either side of the coin <,> whereas <,> punchmark coins had only symbols on  
one side and reverse <,> was blank <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#119:1:A>
After the uninscribed cast coins <,,> came the era of the  
inscribed coins <,,> that means this coins mentioned the name of the king and  
the dynasty to which he belonged <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#120:1:A>
But like the punchmark and uninscribed coins <,> these coins too  
never mentioned the date of issue of the coins <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#121:1:A>
And for that matter <,> none of the Andhra coins <,> prior to the  
medieval period <,> ever mentioned <,> either the <w> mint's </w> name <,> or  
the date of issue of the <,> coins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#122:1:A>
First inscribed coins <,,> that came to light <,,> in Andhra  
region <,> belonged to king Gobhadra <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#123:1:A>
He was a small local ruler <,> in the Telangana region <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#124:1:A>
If this is a copper <,,> coin issued by king Gobhadra <,,> obverse  
side shows the script <,> in the centre <,> a bow and arrow symbol at the top  
<,,> and right <,> lower part shows the arched hill symbol <,> and tree and  
railing symbol <,> to its left <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#125:1:A>
These coins were followed by <,,> such kings as <,> Naranna <,,>  
Khambayasa <,> and Samagopa <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#126:1:A>
There is no literary <,> or historical evidence of the existence  
of these four rulers <,> Gobhadra <,> Naranna <,> Khambayasa and Samagopa <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#127:1:A>
Only through coins we came to know the existence of these rulers  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#128:1:A>
These are two <,> Samagopa coins <,,> one on the left side shows  
the obverse side of the coin <,> whereas one on the right side shows the  
reverse side of an another coin <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#129:1:A>
Coin on the left side <,> shows the script in the centre <,,> and  
at the upper part <,> you see a bow and arrow symbol <,> and slightly to its  
left you see a part of the <indig> sadachakra </indig> symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#130:1:A>
At the lower right hand corner <,> you see the symbol of tree and  
railing <,> and to its left you see the tree arch hill symbol with dots  
inside <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#131:1:A>
On the right hand side you see <,> the reverse side of the coin  
showing the <indig> nandipatha </indig> symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#132:1:A>
Similarly <,> coastal Andhra region was ruled by Meghvahana  
dynasty <,> of Kalinga <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#133:1:A>
There coins too have been discovered in recent times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#134:1:A>
Except for one <,> inscription <,> mentioning about the existence  
of the Meghvahana ruler <,> there is no other literary or any historical  
evidence <,,> that how many kings <,,> ruled <,> or became part of this  
Meghavahana dynasty <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-022#135:1:A>
In recent times <,> coins of these kings who ruled northern  
coastal region were found <,> and coins give a clue <,,> of the names of five  
kings who belong to this dynasty <,,> </I>
