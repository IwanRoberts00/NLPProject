<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-047#1:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a good morning to you all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#2:1:A>
Uh <,,> in fact you see my aim <,,> is to give you <,> as much
information about Indian English <,,> as possible during these two lectures
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#3:1:A>
<w> It's </w> uh there has been a lot <,,> there has been a lot of
work <,> in fact you see done <,,> in order to <,> establish <,> Indian
English <,> as uh <,,> a standard <,,> variety of uh British English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#4:1:A>
So <,> uh I will give you <,,> means in fact you see <w> I'm </w>
just giving you <,> information about whatever has uh <,> gone in for <,,>
the establishment of <,> the identity of <,> Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#5:1:A>
So most of you <,,> know that uh <,> the term <mention> Indian
English </mention> <,,> is used <,,> to describe English <,,> as used by <,>
the Indians <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#6:1:A>
Uh there have been several <,> attempts to establish the identity of
Indian English through investigations into its major distinctive features
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#7:1:A>
Uh the seminar on Indian English <,,> held at uh C I E F L <,>
Hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two <,,> may be described as the first
collective effort <,,> to arrive at <,> some definite conclusions regarding
<,> the status of Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#8:1:A>
Now the conclusion <,,> arrived at <,,> were <,,> Indian English is
not a substandard English <,> it is not <,,> pidgin English <,> it is not
just British English with a few Indian spices <,> added to it <,> it has its
own distinct identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#9:1:A>
So these were the conclusions <,,> uh at which <,> the seminar <,,>
on <mention> Indian English </mention> <,> held at uh Hyderabad <,> arrived
you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#10:1:A>
So <,> uh Ramesh Mohan later on <,> edited the paper <,,> published
<,,> the the papers <w> I'm </w> sorry <,> the papers which were presented at
the seminar <,,> uh with the title <mention> Indian writing in English
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#11:1:A>
Now as the title of the book suggests <,,> the emphasis was on
Indian writing in English <,> only four papers <,,> attempted to describe
<,,> the lexical <,> phonological and syntactic features of Indian English

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#12:1:A>
And one of the papers was <,,> by Kachru <,,> one of the papers was
by Kachru <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#13:1:A>
Now <,,> you must be knowing you see during the colonial days <,>
Englishmen considered <,> Indian English as a substandard variety of British
English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#14:1:A>
Uh now for instance you see certain <,> uh derogatory terms were
used to describe Indian English <,> terms like <,> babu English <,> butler
English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#15:1:A>
Now you get reference <,,> to these terms in <,> Yule and <w>
Bernell's </w> <,> Hobsan and Johnson <,,> uh Hobsan and Jobson <,> <w> I'm
</w> sorry Hobson <,> Hobson Jobson it is <,> Hobson Jobson <,> uh which was
published in Eighteen hundred eighty-six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#16:1:A>
Uh <,> now Indian English was also described as kitchen English <,>
and <indig> Arey Bhai slof </indig> <,,> by P Lal in his article <,> on uh
<,,> Indian writing in English which was published in Harward educational
review <,,> uses these two terms <,> kitchen English and <indig> Arey Bhai
slof </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#17:1:A>
So uh <,> so the <,> means uh during the early days <,,> Indian
English <,> was not acceptable to the British people <,> and uh probably the
Indians even did not think of Indian English <,> as uh <,,> having its own
distinct identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#18:1:A>
But uh <,> the sustained efforts <,> made over years by Indian
English linguists <,> critics <,> creative writers and teachers of English
have now established <,> Indian English as a standard variety of <,> English
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#19:1:A>
Now I would uh <,,> uh comment on you see Indian English as a non-
native variety of English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#20:1:A>
Now some <,,> researchers or investigators would accept <,> Indian
English as a non-native variety of English whereas some <,,> uh researchers
<,> would not accept <,> some researchers like Daswani he would not accept
<,> Indian English as a non-native variety of <,> English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#21:1:A>
Uh <,> now it was Prator <,,> who first <,,> talked of uh Indian
English this I have provided you with uh <,> select bibliography <,> and uh
there are <,> references <,,> to some of the <,> articles to which <w> I'm
</w> going to <.> refe </.> to which <w> I'm </w> going to refer in my <,>
lecture you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#22:1:A>
So Prator <,> uh dismissed Indian English <,> as a local <,,>
unintelligible model of English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#23:1:A>
So he said this is a local model <,,> unintelligible <,> and uh <,>
uh he objected to the setting <,> up <,> of the local variety of English
instead of R P <,> as a model for the learners <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#24:1:A>
So he insisted that R P should be the model for the learners <,>
and there should not be uh <,> any attempt <,> to <,> present the local
variety of English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#25:1:A>
Now <,> uh Prator in fact called <,> it the heretical tenet <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#26:1:A>
He said it was uh <,> it is the he said you see it was the
heretical tenet <,> that the local <,> model should be given uh <,> for the
learning of the pronunciation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#27:1:A>
Now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was Bansal who
insisted that there should be <,> a local model <,,> a local model for <,>
the teaching of pronunciation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#28:1:A>
Uh so far <,> uh there have been some attempts you see but so far
<,> we have not been able to <,,> come to <,> a local model

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#29:1:A>
Probably it would be possible in future when <,> uh the <,,> I C E
project will <,,> come out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#30:1:A>
I C E project that is the international corpus of English project
<,> which <,> is now <,> being carried out you see

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#31:1:A>
And the for the first time you would be uh <,> for the first time
you see the spoken aspect of Indian English <,> is taken into consideration
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#32:1:A>
So later on <w> it's </w> quite possible the <,> possible that the
local model <,> of spoken English <,> would be <,> uh presented <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#33:1:A>
So Prator <,,> uh seems to have ignored <,,> the basic principle
regarding intelligibility <,> which when he calls Indian English as <,> uh
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the <,> basic principle now <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#34:1:A>
Now Catford <,> in his uh <,> uh article the teaching of English as
a foreign language which was <,> which was published in nineteen hundred
fifty <,> says that <,> the concept of intelligibility <,> has to be related
<,> to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness <,> in a speech
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#35:1:A>
So he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to
the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness <,> in a speech situation
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#36:1:A>
Now Kachru adds to these <,,> to the parametre of the context of
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#37:1:A>
Kachru talks of the context of situation now

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#38:1:A>
Uh <,> so <,> <.> I I </.> Indian English has <,,> all of you know
<,> is used in <,,> uh socio-cultural context <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#39:1:A>
It is used even <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#40:1:A>
So Indian English as uh <,> most of you know <,> is used mainly in
Indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#41:1:A>
<.> I </.> Indian English has been used <,> as a link language as a
<,> official language

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#42:1:A>
So we need to take into consideration <,> the context of situation
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#43:1:A>
Now uh <,> uh <,,> talking about the phonology <,,> or the
phonological aspect of Indian English <,> it may be said that uh <,> we
should give more <,> importance <,> to the meaning rather than the noise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#44:1:A>
Now I would like to refer to J R <O> one word </O> book <,> uh
<mention> Speech </mention> which was published <,> in nineteen hundred and
thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#45:1:A>
Now J R <O> one word </O> says that uh <,> uh meaning is as much
<,,> a property of the situational context of people as the noise is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#46:1:A>
So meaning is necessary <,,> and <w> that's </w> why <,,> uh I
think you see it would uh <,> not be sensible at all <,> to present the
speaker of R P <,> as the model <,> for spoken English <,> uh to a junior
class in a village in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#47:1:A>
Uh it would not be possible uh <,> uh it would not be sensible and
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#48:1:A>
Now it has been claimed <,> that uh <,> uh Indians <,> need not
concentrate much on the spoken form <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#49:1:A>
It has been claimed you see means when you <,> uh take into
consideration <,> the aspect of communication <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#50:1:A>
Uh now it is said that <,> uh the meaning should be taken into
consideration rather than the noise that we make <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#51:1:A>
So the role of English in India has been <,> to integrate <,,>
culturally and linguistically <,> the pluralistic societies within India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#52:1:A>
And uh it has never been the primary aim of <,> uh English in India
<,,> to integrate <,> with the British or American culture <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#53:1:A>
American culture and <w> that's </w> why <,,> we did not <,,> pay
much attention you see to the <,> spoken aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#54:1:A>
But uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#55:1:A>
So throughout the years <,,> Indians <,> accepted English <,,> they
acculturated English <,> and uh <,> the acculturated English <,> is what we
call Indian English <,,> what we call Indian English

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#56:1:A>
So this linguistic assimilation <,,> that has taken place <,> <}>
<-> in </-> <+> with </+> </}> regard to English in India <,,> may be
compared to <,,> it may be compared to the Indianisation of Persian language
<,,> or the Dravidianisation of Sanskrit language <,,> or even <,> the
Indo-Aryanisation of Dravidian languages in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#57:1:A>
It may be compared <,> uh to these now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#58:1:A>
Bhatia <,,> uh <,,> presents <,> four criteria <,,> on the basis of
which he would establish Indian English as a non-native variety <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#59:1:A>
For the first <,,> criterion about which he talks is that <,> in
India English is learnt <,> from the school stage of education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#60:1:A>
So before <,,> uh uh before a boy starts <,> before a boy or a girl
<,,> uh starts <,,> learning English <,,> he or she has already learnt the
mother tongue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#61:1:A>
She has already learnt the mother tongue

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#62:1:A>
So <,> the use of English in India has been <,> from fine to formal
<,,> or sometimes even informal <,,> situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#63:1:A>
But uh <,,> uh English in India is never used for <,> intimate
situations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#64:1:A>
It is never used for intimate situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#65:1:A>
Uh so <,,> uh <-> the </-> according to him you see the second
criterion is this <,,> the intimate situations <,,> are not <,,> the region
of uh Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#66:1:A>
Then a non-native speaker <,> has <,> limited facility to use the
various registors <,> of the language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#67:1:A>
So the native speaker can use all the registors of the language
whereas uh <,> uh Indians in <,> uh Indians <,> cannot use all the registors
of language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#68:1:A>
Then <,,> as a non-native variety <,,> English in India has uh <,,>
phonetic <,,> syntactic and symantic deviations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#69:1:A>
So these deviations even would establish <,> India English as a
non-native variety <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#70:1:A>
Now Bansal <,,> objected <,> to <,> <w> Prator's </w> observations
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#71:1:A>
Uh Bansal <,> Bansal infact you see uh <,> wrote uh <,> in his <,,>
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article <,> that the subjective element or the
<,> uh or the <,> puritan attitude <,> which uh Prator <,,> had been
representing in his criticism of <,> Indian English was altogetherly wrong
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#72:1:A>
So uh <,> Bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of Indian
English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#73:1:A>
So he wanted to establish <,> that Indian <,> in Indian English is
intelligible <,> as against <w> Prator's </w> criticism of Indian English as
uintelligible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#74:1:A>
So uh <,> he <,> uh came to the conclusion <,> that uh <,,> an
average figure of intelligibility between educated Indian speaker <,> and R P
speaker <,> is seventy-three percent <,,> is seventy-three precent <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#75:1:A>
So uh <,> Indian English cannot be dismissed as unintelligible
variety <,,> of English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#76:1:A>
So his study was based on a <,> on recorded specimens of English of
the Indian speech community <,> and uh it described even <,> the phonetic
features of Indian English speech <,> which uh <,> differ from the <,> R P
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#77:1:A>
<w> Bansal's </w> nineteen hundred seventy-two study <,> was an
attempt to analyse <,> and describe <,> the common core of language patterns
<,,> the common core of language patterns <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#78:1:A>
Now uh <,> later on you see perk even Quirk talked of <,> the <,>
uh nuclei the nuclear <,> English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#79:1:A>
He talked about the nuclear English later on Quirk <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#80:1:A>
Now <,> the common core <,> uh of course uh <,> uh one of the
conclusions <,,> I would be arriving at <,> would be that <,,> when it comes
to <,> the <,,> common core <,,> Indian English does not differ much from <,>
British English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#81:1:A>
So this would be one of the conclusions <,> uh at which I would
like to arrive at the end <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#82:1:A>
So Bansal <,> wanted <,,> to uh <,> find out <,> if it was possible
to have the common core <,> shared by <,> all the members of Indian speech
community <,,> all the members of Indian speech community

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#83:1:A>
Now he said you see <,> uh now of course you see <,> in India <,>
English is used for uh <,> a variety of purposes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#84:1:A>
But Bansal compares the variedness of Indian English with that of
human behaviour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#85:1:A>
So he says human behaviour when we <,> talk of human behaviour <,>
we concentrate on similarity <,> and not on differences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#86:1:A>
So in the same way we should think of this similar <,,> uh the
similar aspects or the similar features <,> and uh that would enable us <,>
to have <,> a common core <,> for the <,> spoken <,,> Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#87:1:A>
Now Verma <,,> uh describes Indian English as an offspring yielded
by English <,,> a second language with a distinct Indian flavour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#88:1:A>
He would describe Indian English as one of the languages of India
<,> used by a community of people at different <,> levels of communication
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#89:1:A>
So <,> and then further he says within the overall general
framework of the basic linguistic systems of British English <,> it displays
certain distinguishing features <,,> and uh he would say <,> it is the
interlanguage situation <,> that contributes to the distinct status of Indian
English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#90:1:A>
So <,> he would say that it will be interlanguage situation

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#91:1:A>
So his concentration is on the interlanguage situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#92:1:A>
So Verma <,> did not want <,> Indian English <,> to be grouped <,>
with American English <,> Canadian English <,> and Australian English because
<,> he said these are the mother tongue varieties <,> whereas Indian English
is a non-native <,> second language variety <,> it is a non- native second
language variety <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#93:1:A>
Now as I told you before <,,> Daswani <,,> would not accept Indian
English as a variety of British <,> British English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#94:1:A>
So <,> but uh there is some <,,> positive <,> element in his
criticism of Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#95:1:A>
He says <,> if systematic relations <,> uh if systematic
relationship between varieties of English <,> such as <,> American Australian
Canadian English and Indian English is established <,> then only <,> Indian
English may be accepted as <,> uh a variety of British English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#96:1:A>
So <,> the relationship <,> between <,> the mother tongue variety
<,> and the Indian English <,> needs to be established <,> and then only we
would accept Indian English as a variety of British English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#97:1:A>
Now if you know you see <,> uh Chowmsky <,> would uh say that <,,>
uh the <,> divergencies <,> this when we talk of a language <,> when we talk
of a <,> a a language let us say <,> uh divergencies at the divergencies are
shown <,> at the level of surface structure <,> rather than at the level of
deep structure <,,> rather than at the level of deep structure <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#98:1:A>
So Daswani says that <,> it has not yet been proved that <,> face
structure rules of British English <,> and Indian English are the same <,,>
are the same <,> and that the difference is only in the area of uh <,>
transformational <,> and phonological rules <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#99:1:A>
So only when <,,> it would be proved <,> that at the level of deep
structure <,> Indian English <,> is <,> the same as British English <,> and
uh <,> only at the level of uh <,> the surface structure Indian English
differs from British English then only we may accept Indian English <,> as a
variety of British English

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#100:1:A>
This is what uh <,> uh Daswani would say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#101:1:A>
Uh Daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and
prepositions <,> in Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#102:1:A>
He even comments on the phoneic interference <,> on account of
negligence of some phonological rules <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#103:1:A>
So we <,,> uh infact do not know certain rules <,,> and we ignore
certain rules and <w> that's </w> why there is phonic interference in Indian
English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#104:1:A>
So he would say uh <,> he would say you see it is <,> out of our
<,> ignorance it is out of uh <,> our ignorance or negligience <,> that uh
<,> we use uh <,> different <,> structures <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#105:1:A>
We use different structures and <w> that's </w> why Indian English
is not a variety <,> of uh <,,> British English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-047#106:1:A>
This is <w> Daswani's </w> <,> uh point of view <,> </I>
