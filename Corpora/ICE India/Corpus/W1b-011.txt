Dear <@> Mr Mistri </@> , 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#4:1>
Sincere thanks for your card and the greetings. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#5:1>
I reciprocate with all my greetings for a happy new
year. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#6:1>
As you will see above the number has changed all over
Germany. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#7:1>
I see from your address that you are no more in the
University. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#8:1>
Are you already retired? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#9:1>
Send me few more details about yourself. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#10:1>
How many children have you got? </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#11:1>
I was in India in the months of January and
February. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#12:1>
I had a French friend with me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#13:1>
So I took him around in the South, then in Vijayawada,
Hyderabad,  
Calcutta, Bhagalpur, Patna, Gaya, Benares, Delhi, Agra, Jaipur
and finally  
Bombay. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#14:1>
To tour around in India, two months are not enough. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#15:1>
We have seen most of Kerala and Bihar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#16:1>
In other places we had to satisfy with few cities. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#17:1>
Anyway my friend was very satisfied. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#18:1>
He has taken the whole trip on video. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#19:1>
He had been a soldier 50 years ago in Vietnam. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#20:1>
So he went from Bombay to Vietnam for two weeks. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#21:1>
He is now 69 years old. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#22:1>
I have finished my doctorate on 4th of November
1993. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#23:1>
Though I have finished my studies I will stay few
more years here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#24:1>
After that I will go back to Bihar where I have worked
for many years  
since 1960. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#25:1>
I do not know when I will have a chance to come to
Kolhapur again. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#26:1>
I have passed that way earlier - - I had done my
studies from 1962 to  
1970 in Poona. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#27:1>
Altogether I am out of Kerala some 34 years. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#28:1>
Have you again another chance to come to Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#29:1>
If you have, then you are most welcome to come here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#30:1>
My house will be free for you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#31:1>
Wishing you and your family members <w> God's </w>
blessings, I  
remain, </p>

Dear <@> Mr Mistri </@> , 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#35:1>
Thank you very much for your greetings. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#36:1>
I am now in a new place since one year. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#37:1>
Here I have plenty of work since the place is big. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#38:1>
In 1993, I completed my doctorate from Lonvain in
Belgium. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#39:1>
I will be few more years here before I return to
Bihar. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#40:1>
How is your health now? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#41:1>
Hope your children are fine. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#42:1>
Have you any more chance to come to Europe? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#43:1>
In case you come again you are most welcome to this
place. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#44:1>
You can stay as long as you want. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#45:1>
This year the winter is severe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#46:1>
We had up to minus 26<sp>o</sp>C so far. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#47:1>
Usually February is the Coldest month. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#48:1>
So we expect worst days. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#49:1>
The rivers, lakes and the seas are frozen. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#50:1>
Everywhere there is thick layer of snow. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#51:1>
Wishing you all the best for 1997, </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#52:1>
I remain.

Dear <@> Mr. Mistri </@> , 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#57:1>
I am in receipt of your last letter ( There was no
date put). 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#58:1>
My sincere thanks to you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#59:1>
Sorry to know that you had a stroke. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#60:1>
I suppose you are back to normal now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#61:1>
I am happy to know about your family. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#62:1>
Anyway in the near future I do not have any plan to
come to India. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#63:1>
In case I come anywhere near I will let you know in
advance. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#64:1>
If you have a chance to come to Europe again you
are most welcome  
here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#65:1>
You can stay with me as long as you want. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#66:1>
It is a pity that last time you did not have much time
to come upto  
here. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#67:1>
I have been in Europe for the past 12 years. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#68:1>
I have lot of friends in Germany, Belgium, Holland,
France, Hungary  
and Austria. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#69:1>
So when I come to India, I will have always someone or
other who  
comes to see our country. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#70:1>
I love my country and since I stay here I appreciate
our country very  
much. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#71:1>
I am very happy to show our country to others. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#72:1>
All those who came with me to India were fascinated by
our country.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#73:1>
We had this year plenty of snow. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#74:1>
It was very cold end of January. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#75:1>
We had upto minus 17 degree centigrade. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#76:1>
Two years ago it came upto 27 degree and we had almost
2 meters of  
snow. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#77:1>
Recently there is flood. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#78:1>
In Kologne the waterlevel of Rhine is 11 meters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#79:1>
In Holland they had to evacuate 300000 people because
they were  
afraid that the dykes would break. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#80:1>
Holland is below the sealevel. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#81:1>
That is why it is also called Niederland. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#82:1>
It has the dykes near the sea shores. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#83:1>
It has also many dykes to protect it from the river
waters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#84:1>
In Belgium and France also there was flood. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#85:1>
In France few people died. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#86:1>
Since two days the rain stopped. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#87:1>
Tommorrow comes rain again. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#88:1>
Hope it will not last long. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#89:1>
Here we are in very high area. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#90:1>
There is no river closeby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#94:1>
Sincere thanks for your greetings. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#95:1>
Since two years I am at the above address. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#96:1>
This is about 70 Kms away from Bayreuth where you had
been once. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#97:1>
This place is 100 kms south of my last place. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#98:1>
From your address I see that you are still at
Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#99:1>
I thought that you had already retired. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#100:1>
How is your health now? </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#101:1>
I was in India in September and October. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#102:1>
I came back on 18th of October then went to France
for 10 days. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#103:1>
I am here in a bigger place. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#104:1>
I had to take up this place after finishing my
doctorate in Belgium. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#105:1>
I am here near Regensburg which is rather big city. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#106:1>
I am also close to the Highway and the Railway. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#107:1>
It is a more convenient place than my last place.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#108:1>
One Belgian and a German came with me to India. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#109:1>
So I had to take them to Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Bihar,
Calcutta,  
Mumbai and many places in Kerala. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#110:1>
My friends were very happy to see many places and to
meet many  
people in different areas of India. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#111:1>
If they were to come with a tourist agency they would
<+> have </+>  
seen only few big places and stayed in hotels. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#112:1>
With me they saw the real India and stayed in
families here and  
there. </p>

Dear <@> Mr. Mistri </@> , 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#117:1>
I hope you received my last letter of 17. 12. 98.


<ICE-IND:W1B-011#118:1>
Hope you are fine. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#119:1>
I saw recently a report on television about the tree
planting in  
Maharashtra. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#120:1>
The name of the tree in Botanical terms is <foreign>
<mention>  
Leuceana </mention> </foreign> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#121:1>
I do not know its name in Marathi. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#122:1>
When I saw that film I was thinking about the
possibility of  
planting Olive trees in Maharashtra. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#123:1>
Since Maharashtra has plenty of rocky places and the
climate is dry,  
olive trees would grow very well. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#124:1>
Such places are also good for wine cultivation. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#125:1>
I was in Poona from 1962 to 1970. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#126:1>
So I know Maharashtra rather well. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#127:1>
When I was in Poona I <}> <-> have </-> <+> had </+>
</}>  
extensively travelled in Maharashtra. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#128:1>
I had been also in Kolhapur. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#129:1>
In the film they showed that by planting the tree
<foreign>  
Leuceana </foreign> the people of the area have enough
firewood, cattlefeed  
and wood for furniture. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#130:1>
It seems the leaves are excellent feed for cattles. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#131:1>
I am sure if the state can introduce Olive trees that
would be a great thing. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#132:1>
It would bring great income to the families. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#133:1>
Olive oil is one of the best oils. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#134:1>
In Many parts of France, Italy, Spain, Greece,
Turkey, Israel etc.,  
where the climate is warm and the terrain is <}> <-> storny
</-> <+> stony </+> </}> we find plenty of olive trees. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#135:1>
I am sure olives will grow in Maharashtra. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#136:1>
Olive trees need very little rain to survive. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#137:1>
If you are interested contact some of the
Agricultural colleges to  
see if there is a way to bring the trees from some of the
above, countries. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#138:1>
Private persons cannot bring plants to India. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#139:1>
But if universities or government want to have them
then there will  
be a way. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#140:1>
I am interested in bringing such things to our
country since I  
like my coutnry. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#141:1>
I would like to know if you can contact someone
for getting the  
trees for Maharashtra. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#142:1>

Dear <@> Mr. Mistri </@> , 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#147:1>
I am in receipt of the fax you sent me yesterday
for which my  
heartfelt thanks. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#148:1>
Yesterday in the afternoon I went for a walk for
about two hours  
through the forest closeby. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#149:1>
As it is real winter we have about half a meter of
snow now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#150:1>
It was a wonderful sight of pure white snow which was
not touched by  
anyone. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#151:1>
Only here and there the footprints of deer or
wildpigs were seen. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#152:1>
Though it was minus 6 degree centigrade outside in
the open, it was  
not that cold in the forest. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#153:1>
After reaching back home I prepared a typical Indian
tea with milk. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#154:1>
As I was taking the tea, it came to my mind perhaps
you may send a  
fax or letter soon. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#155:1>
Not even a second passed the telephone began to ring.


<ICE-IND:W1B-011#156:1>
As I took the phone, I made out that it is a fax. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#157:1>
I put down the phone and pressed the button for the
fax and your fax  
was there! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#158:1>
How can we explain this? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#159:1>
This is not the first time that such things happened.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#160:1>
You can very well make use of my letters if they
are good for  
your purpose. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#161:1>
Please do not give my name. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#162:1>
I do not keep the old letters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#163:1>
I write more than 600 letters a year and get more or
less same  
amount. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#164:1>
If I keep all the letters it would become a mountain
in few <w>  
years'</w> time! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#165:1>
Only if the letters contain some important
informations, I keep  
them. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#166:1>
I will also write to Mr. Hegde soon. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#167:1>
Do you have agricultural universities in Maharashtra?


<ICE-IND:W1B-011#168:1>
We have such in Bihar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#169:1>
Some such universities with Government help can
bring Olive  
trees. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#170:1>
Only if the government is interested we can bring
such trees to  
India. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#171:1>
Private persons are not allowed to introduce new
plants to our  
country. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#172:1>
I have seen on television that special palmtrees
were brought to  
<}> <-> Malasia </-> <+> Malaysia </+> </}> and Indonesia for
producing oil. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#173:1>
Though it was a great success the monculture changed
the face of the  
countryside. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#174:1>
Besides the terrain where these palmtrees were
planted were good for  
other crops. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#175:1>
Though it has brought economic gain, it did harm to
the nature. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#176:1>
We must not use good land, where we can produce other
crops, to plant olive trees. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#177:1>
We must use only useless land, stony, rocky and poor
in water  
facilities, to plant the trees. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#178:1>
That way we will give beauty to barren land making it
green and come to help the nature itself. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#179:1>
By doing so the poor people around will have some
additional income. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#180:1>
When I went through Israel, Greece, Spain,
France, Portugal and  
Italy and saw the plantation of Olive trees, I thought about
bringing them to  
our country especially to the stony places. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#181:1>
It would surely bring great help to the people and
also will improve  
their health since olive oil is one of the best oils. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-011#182:1>
If you are coming to Europe it must be before
August. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#183:1>
I will be away in August. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#184:1>
September onwards will be very cold for you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#185:1>
Those who are not used to the cold it will be
impossible to manage here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#186:1>
We have now minus 15 degree centigrade in the night. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#187:1>
All the ponds, lakes, small rivers etc. are frozen. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#188:1>
We cannot stay outside for longer period. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#189:1>
If we are on the move it is OK. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#190:1>
In the houses there is heating. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#191:1>
So work fast and come in June or july. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#192:1>
That is the best time to come. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#193:1>
You and your wife are most welcome.

If she is coming for the first time you must take her
to many places in Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#195:1>
From England you must take undersea tunnel train to
come to Paris. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#196:1>
After seeing Paris take the train to Brussels, then
to Germany. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#197:1>
You can stay as long as you want with me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#198:1>
From here it may be good to go through Vienna in
Austria to Rome. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#199:1>
In Italy you must see Venice, Florence, Pisa and
Rome. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#200:1>
You can fly back to India from Rome. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#201:1>
You must buy Eurail pass from India for the train
trip in Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#202:1>
Otherwise it will be very costly to travel in Europe.

I do not know if you have travelled extensively
in Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#204:1>
There are many interesting places to see. </p>

I know that you must have sent the fax from some
office. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#206:1>
Since you do not have a fax, I have to send this
letter by mail.  
</p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-011#207:1>
Wishing <w> God's </w> grace and blessing on you and
your family, I  
remain.
