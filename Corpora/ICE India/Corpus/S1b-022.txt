<ICE-IND:S1B-022#1:1:A>
The last phases of the election campaign <,> are <,> coming
upon us <,> very soon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#2:1:A>
It has been a tragic election in a way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#3:1:A>
Introductive tragically <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#4:1:A>
And <,> we are <,> now <,,> approaching the last <}> <-> phases </->
<+> phase </+> </}> of the election <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#5:1:A>
With uh <,> me this evening <,> is a very interesting panel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#6:1:A>
We have our <,> the chief election commissioner Mr Seshan <,,> and
<w> we've </w> Dileep Padgaonkar editor of <mention> The Times Of India
</mention> <,> and we have Prabhu Chawla <,> a great <O> one word </O> of
<mention> Indian Express </mention> <,,> and <w> I'm </w> Nihal Singh <,> a
columnist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#7:1:A>
Uh Mr Seshan <,> if I might ask <,> a rather genuine question to
begin with <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#8:1:A>
You have proved to be the most controversial chief election
commissioner in <w> India's </w> history <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#9:1:A>
Uh do you think it is because of the prevailing <,> political
climate <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#10:1:A>
Or do you think it is because of your personality <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#11:1:A>
Or do you think <w> it's </w> the combination of both <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#12:1:B>
I think my good fortunes are related to several factors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#13:1:B>
I think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised
election as <w> I've </w> been saying for the last two three months <,> of
all the election that have been held in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#14:1:B>
Uh certain things have improved <,> certain things have not
improved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#15:1:B>
Of course you ask the question which <w> I'm </w> a little <,> at a
loss of word to answer am I controversial <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#16:1:B>
I remember telling somebody very recently <,> and I would like to
repeat that that <,,> I was not intending to be a very soft aids weapon of
doing this work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#17:1:B>
I had uh <,> cautioned everybody <,,> that the election commission
intended to take <w> it's </w> work seriously <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#18:1:B>
And make sure that the country would get the election which it is
entitle to which is a fair and free election <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#19:1:B>
And as far as <w> I'm </w> concerned anything which comes in the
way of a fair and free election <,,> <w> it's </w> a good object <,> to be
satisfied <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#20:1:B>
If unfortunately that produces controversy <,,> <w> I'll </w> say
<O> two words </O> <w> I've </w> sinned <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#21:1:A>
Well I think Dileepji wanted to raise the question of the
abruptness of some of the decision <,> <{> <[> no I <,> how they were taken
<,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#22:1:C>
<[> No I </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#23:1:C>
No I I did want to take off from where you left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#24:1:C>
To say that uh <,,> we have here a situation where <,,> the <,,>
entire political class seems to be <,> ranged against the election
commissioner <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#25:1:C>
And I <,> I have been trying very hard to find out how <w> he's
</w> achieved <,> this remarkable feat in this remarkable <,,> period of time
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#26:1:C>
Uh is it because uh <,> not just that you wanted to <,> to take
this election seriously <,> but also that the rot in the electoral process
that stretch in such a long time ago

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#27:1:C>
Did you expect to stand it <,,> in <,> one go so to speak ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#28:1:B>
Uh Dileep I <,> must apologise for not responding to the
statement you made about <,,> what did you say the rot which is set into the
system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#29:1:B>
In my own <,> rather limited way <w> I've </w> been saying and I
will say <,> that what had happened as I mentioned before <,> is a certain
loss of credibility in the election systems spread all over the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#30:1:B>
And <w> it's </w> loss merely is not a question of losing faith in
election in one small part of the country or the other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#31:1:B>
The entire <w> system's </w> credibility is at stake <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#32:1:B>
Now <,> you put it in stronger language <,> I am by training and
otherwise not accustom to using harsh language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#33:1:B>
So <,> my answer to your question would be that <,,> uh uh may be
you are perfectly right in saying that I <,> tried to put right whatever was
in my view not right or whatever is in the <w> country's </w> view not right
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#34:1:B>
Uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#35:1:B>
But all that I can tell you is <,> that the founding fathers in the
constitutional the representation of the people <?> rank </?> clothed the
election commission <,,> with an abundance of powers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#36:1:B>
Which the lordships in the supreme court repeatedly replace it
until these are power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#37:1:B>
As one set of lordship once said <quote> it is not as if the
election commission <,> so <O> one word </O> in a difficult situation hold
its hands and fold in prayer and say good Lord <,> give me guidence what to
do </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#38:1:B>
Yet <,> I do even now pray to god for guidence very often <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#39:1:B>
But I don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully
available in writing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#40:1:B>
I should act <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#41:1:B>
This I have made clear and I <,> have acted to the best of my
ability

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#42:1:A>
No Mr Seshan I am raising a different question all together
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#43:1:A>
Belief has ended with broader <,> question of <,> rot which has set
into the system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#44:1:A>
But I rightly put in the beginning that you were determined to <,>
to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#45:1:A>
But what it counts <,> around now after your various action
postponing the election counter manding the election <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#46:1:A>
It seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a <,,> supreme
court judge of India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#47:1:A>
Where you don't hear anybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#48:1:A>
You deliver justice <,> without telling anybody what are the cause
for delivering this particular kind of justice

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#49:1:A>
<w> You're </w> giving a judgement <,> saying <w> you're </w> <?>
hang </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#50:1:A>
When somebody protest then you say <quote> come <,> here and <w>
I'll </w> hear you </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#51:1:A>
What is now that is trying the credibility of situation is <,> your
one <-> sense </- > <,> sided decision making <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#52:1:A>
You have not heard anybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#53:1:A>
You see <,> in a political democracy <,> dialogue is an <}> <-> <.>
ess </.> </-> <=> essential </=> <-> <.> ingre </.> </-> <=> ingredient </=>
</}> of a political system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#54:1:A>
And <w> you're </w> just sacrificing the dialogues at all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#55:1:B>
Well uh <,> Prabhu all the time I say is that I indoubtely
agree with you

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#56:1:B>
You said <,> <quote> <w> you're </w> a supreme court judge doing
various things </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#57:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> equated to a supreme court

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#58:1:C>
Correct but they hear everything

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#59:1:B>
No no no <w> I'm </w> not

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#60:1:C>
<w> You're </w> not hearing like supreme court

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#61:1:B>
No no no <w> I'm </w> not denying in the least that the right
<,> natural right of justice of being heard ought to be available <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#62:1:B>
But <,,> I can only go by the rule book which parliament has handed
me down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#63:1:B>
In certain places what does it say for example if I may <,> at the
risk of uh of of of wasting listeners time <,> mention in fact

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#64:1:C>
Yes you have to waste listeners time

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#65:1:B>
No I I

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#66:1:C>
No no no no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#67:1:B>
I am not

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#68:1:C>
No no no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#69:1:B>
I was not suggesting that you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#70:1:C>
Let me complete first because you have been <,> when you are
quoting the parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#71:1:C>
<}> <-> Is the </-> <,> <=> has the </=> </}> parliament given you
power not to hear anybody ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#72:1:B>
No no <,> please <{> <[> no I was not <,> I was not suggesting
</[> in the least that your question was a waste of time <,> I said <w> I'm
</w> going to quote a section of law <,> which could tantamount to spending a
little mere time when it is justified <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#73:1:B>
It says <quote> if the election commission is satisfied <,> it can
do so and so so and so <,> in appropriate place </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#74:1:B>
Now <,> I don't want to get into again a legal argument for the
question

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#75:1:B>
<w> You're </w> perfectly right <,> that if the time is available
and the oppurtunity is available <,> the courses of natural justice must all
be followed

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#76:1:B>
I have no disagreement with that at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#77:1:B>
But if you had to take a decision <,> which have to be taken <,>
<-> in </-> within hours <,> if not less than hour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#78:1:B>
Then <,> it is not always possible to go through hearings and what
not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#79:1:B>
Number two <,> is that where the proof is abstractedly available
<,,> without necessarily listening to but it is not

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#80:1:B>
For example you refer to counter manding <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#81:1:B>
This counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#82:1:B>
It is against the state or place in a particular constituency <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#83:1:C>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#84:1:C>
But does it <,> what are the implications of counter manding

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#85:1:B>
Implications are serious <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#86:1:B>
But

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#87:1:C>
If you cannot hear the party

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#88:1:B>
No <,> parliament in nineteen eighty-nine <,> decided <,> that
if booth capturing happens the election commission <,> and if I may say so
with great respect <,> it doesn't say election commission may <,> it says
<quote> the election commission shall countermand the election </quote>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#89:1:C>
After hearing the party

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#90:1:B>
No <{> <[> he says </[> not hearing the party <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#91:1:C>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#92:1:B>
Let me again mention this to you that where a situation has
produced evidence adequate enough <,> to say that hearing is not necessary I
feel it <,> called upon I feel called upon to take a decision <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#93:1:B>
I mean I don't disagree with you

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#94:1:B>
I do not want to disagree with you at any stage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#95:1:B>
That a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that
somebody should be heard who is likely to be affected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#96:1:B>
But in that case somebody might even argue if I countermand the
election in a particular constituency I should hear all the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#97:1:B>
Why only the candidates <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#98:1:B>
If I countermand the election in constituency X <,,> then <,>
surely I should hear all the people in that and not merely the twenty thirty
forty candidates who have filled up <,> I I mean who have <,> been nominated
by the

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#99:1:C>
Mr Seshan you are trying to set up conventions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#100:1:C>
Which are <}> <-> <.> creat </.> which are </-> <=> creating </=>
</}> more problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#101:1:C>
You are creating political instability by <}> <-> deciding
decision one </-> <=> taking one decision </=> </}> in the morning <,> taking
some other decisions two days later

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#102:1:D>
<}> <-> May I </-> <=> may I </=> </}> put it more
specifically this point <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#103:1:D>
Uh the fact that you said <,> you counteremanded X number of uh
<,> consitituencies

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#104:1:D>
Alright elections in these constituencies <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#105:1:D>
Later you came round to say <quote> well <w> I'm </w> <,,>
reconsidering my decisions </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#106:1:D>
Now <,> that leaves you open to a lot of criticism and also it <}>
<-> it <.> intr </.> </-> <=> introduces </=> <-> <.> instable </.> </-> <=>
instability </=> </}> in the political <,> set-up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#107:1:D>
That is one point

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#108:1:D>
And the other <-> is </-> <,> uh that has been raised by a number
of parties is <,> that you are supposed to have told <,> one delegation that
<quote> as far as election <w> officer's </w> reports are concerned <,> the
days <,,> those days are over </quote> now that is how <w> it's </w> been
reported <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#109:1:D>
Maybe you would like to <,> answer <{> <[> this question </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#110:1:B>
<[> Well let </[> </{> me answer the second part first <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#111:1:B>
And uh <,> I I <w> I'll </w> come up to a little later as far as
the question of <,,> total dependability of the official heirarchy of
officers to be impartial in all that they do <,> is regretably no longer
available <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#112:1:B>
Whether it is uh <,> officers at higher level officers at the
lower level or <O> one word </O> work reciding in polling offices and polling
stations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#113:1:B>
People who work as magistrates and others <,> people at higher
level <,> district election officers and still higher <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#114:1:B>
I may say with all the humility I possess <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#115:1:B>
In all the humility I possess that the point of time at which <,>
one could say without asking any question that this report would be totally
impartial <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#116:1:B>
Any content mistakes of facts which are genuinely mistakes of fact
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#117:1:B>
But which they are not those of <,> if I may use very bad word
committed people <,> is no longer available <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#118:1:B>
This I did mention to more than one political party <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#119:1:B>
But <,> we have tried to make sure <,> that there are enough
checks and balances built-in <,> in order to ensure that somebody say so if
not adequate for taking an action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#120:1:B>
This is as far as it concern

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#121:1:C>
Now you raise the other question you countermanded <,> and
then you are hearing people

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#122:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#123:1:C>
Does this create the instability <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#124:1:B>
It certainly creates doubts in the minds of people whether
the election commission <,> is in two minds about its own decisions

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#125:1:B>
As far as I am concerned <,> those five counteremanding decisions
were taken with a full sense of responsibility <,> after analyzing the status
and <,> hundreds and hundreds of reports which were received on the twentieth
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#126:1:C>
There was official <+> report </+> <,> they were none of the
official report

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#127:1:B>
No <,> <w> I'm </w> sorry <,> I I don't concede that
statement to you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#128:1:B>
I don't concede the fore factual possession to you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#129:1:B>
You may be referring to report from a certain set of offices like

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#130:1:C>
Look here <,> chief election commissioners office in the
state

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#131:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> again mentioning you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#132:1:C>
<w> You've </w> the returning officer in the state

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#133:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> mentioning it you

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#134:1:B>
I have reports of the returning officers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#135:1:B>
I have reports of the chief electoral officer

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#136:1:C>
Recommending <}> <-> <.> rec </.> </-> <=> recommending </=>
</}> this countermanding <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#137:1:B>
Look <,> I I <w> I'm </w> sorry

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#138:1:B>
I am not going into individual specifics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#139:1:B>
I am mentioning again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#140:1:B>
In coming to certain conclusions <,> we are not taking into
account <,> or failing to take into account any kinds of valid information
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#141:1:B>
I will tell you we have returning officers reports <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#142:1:B>
We have chief electoral officers reports <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#143:1:B>
I have sent out three hundred central officers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#144:1:B>
Now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources
and money to sent three hundred observers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#145:1:B>
Now what was behind the sending of observer <,> somebody could
have asked this question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#146:1:B>
Why do you have to sent central observers and state observers

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#147:1:D>
They sent all the time

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#148:1:D>
Last <{> <[> time we had </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#149:1:B>
<[> They are not sent </[> </{> all the time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#150:1:B>
They were

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#151:1:D>
Not three hundred but hundred <O> a few words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#152:1:B>
<-> <w> I'm </w> </-> <,> may I mention with all great
respect that last time around a total of seventy-five people were deployed
throughout the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#153:1:B>
This time I deployed three hundred not because I would like supply
to <,> deploy more

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#154:1:D>
Therefore the election <+> has </+> not been smooth <,> even
after deploying three hundred

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#155:1:B>
No <,> no I don't <{> <[> recommend that </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#156:1:D>
<[> <?> Election has been </?> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-022#157:1:B>
<-> I will </-> let me tell you the elections were smooth in
Haryana <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-022#158:1:B>
They were smooth in Himachal they were smooth in Rajasthan <,>
they were smooth in Madhya Pradesh <,> they were smooth in Andhra Pradesh
