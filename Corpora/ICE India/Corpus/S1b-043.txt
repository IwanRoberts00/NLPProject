<ICE-IND:S1B-043#1:1:A>
Mrs Jamuna is a Congress-I member of Parliament representing
Rajamundri east Godavari of Andhra Pradesh <,> in the <indig> Lok Sabha
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#2:1:A>
This is her first term as a member of parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#3:1:A>
But <,> her talent is multifaceted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#4:1:A>
Long before she face the people <,> she was facing <}> <-> life
</-> <,> <=> studio life </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#5:1:A>
Yes <,,> she is a famous film personality of Andhra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#6:1:A>
But she is known beyond Andhra as well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#7:1:A>
Those of us who remember the film <mention> <indig> Milan </indig>
</mention> <,> cannot forget her award winning performance as Gauri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#8:1:A>
But apart from <,,> occasional stories into the Hindi cinema <,> she
has largely restricted herself <,> to Telugu cinema <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#9:1:A>
Although she has also acted in Tamil and Kannada films as well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#10:1:A>
Jamunajee <,> considering how many films and how films have been
<,> making politicians in the south <,> it must have been smooth sailing for
you isn't it <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#11:1:B>
Yes of course <,> because uh <,,> being a cine artist <,,> uh
we <}> <-> use to <-> <+> are </+> </}> <,> more accustomed to public <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#12:1:B>
Because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses <,> and
uh for shooting <,> and for for public meeting <,> as a social workers also
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#13:1:B>
We have a lot of contact with uh <,> public in cine life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#14:1:B>
So naturally when we have become a <,,> uh politician <,> I think
uh <,> <w> it's </w> not much difficult to <,,> uh do our service <,> as <O>
one or two word </O> our politician

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#15:1:A>
When did you actually entered films <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#16:1:B>
I was so young <,> I think uh <,> nineteen fifty-two <,> I was
just fourteen years <,> may be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#17:1:B>
So I entered into the film fray <,> as a heroine <,> in the first
picture itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#18:1:B>
One <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[> uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#19:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{> <w> I'm </w> sorry <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#20:1:B>
Uh my first picture was <,> the name <,> <mention> <indig>
Foottillu </indig> </mention> that means <,> in Hindi you can say <indig>
Maike </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#21:1:B>
In nineteen fifty-two <,> one Mr uh <,> late Raja Rao <,> he
introduced me to the film <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#22:1:B>
He hails from <,> uh Rajamundri constituency which <w> I'm </w>
<,,> now presenting <,> as a public <,,> servant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#23:1:B>
So he introduced me to the film <,> as a heroine first <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#24:1:A>
We know that you have <,> for thirty years <,> played a
leading role <,> in cinema <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#25:1:A>
Especially that you have always played a leading actress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#26:1:A>

<mention> <indig> Milan </indig> </mention> best actress award <,> in those
days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#39:1:B>
I think <w> I'm </w> the first South Indian star to receive a
filmfare award <,> as a best actress in <,> <mention> <indig> Milan </indig>
</mention> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#40:1:A>
Now that <w> you've </w> become a member of parliament <,> is
it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#41:1:B>
Yes <,,> especially <,> uh become MP all our <w> MP's </w>
collegues are uh <,> very much interested to see my films <,> old films

They are asking me <,> uh <indig> Jamunajee kahan milte hai apke
</indig> films <indig> apto bahot purani kalakar hai </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#43:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#44:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#45:1:B>
I will give it <,> as a presentation to everybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#46:1:B>
I was trying to get hold of my old films <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#47:1:B>
<O> One or two words </O> you know that old films are very precious
to get

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#48:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#49:1:A>
We also know that you have been active on theatre <,> front <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#50:1:A>
Uh <w> you're </w> also the president of the Andhra Pradesh
professional theatre group <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#51:1:A>
What are your activities there <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#52:1:B>
You see as a artist also <,> I acted more than two hundred
films <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#53:1:B>
We have <,> acted such a wonderful characters <,> unforgetable
roles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#54:1:B>
Uh even as a <,,> old lady <,> uh and then uh <,> sufferring lady
just like <mention> Mother India </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#55:1:B>
I did <mention> Mother India </mention> character in Telugu version
which Nargis did in Hindi version <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#56:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> a very <,> beautiful motherly character <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#57:1:B>
So such <-> a </-> types of characters I acted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#58:1:B>
And then <,> after that <,> I thought <}> <-> of </-> <+> to </+>
</}> do some <,,> uh work for uplift of these <,,> old <?> indigent </?>
theatre artist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#59:1:B>
Because cinema is uh <,> fundamentally <,> we should act in <,> uh
dramas only

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#60:1:B>
From dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you
see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#61:1:B>
So one should not forget theatre at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#62:1:B>
We came from theatre

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#63:1:B>
We hail from theatre <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#64:1:B>
We have learnt acting on theatre <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#65:1:B>
So I want to do service to theatre artist <,> I become a <,> uh
president of AP Professional Artist Theatre Federation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#66:1:B>
It is uh <,> uhm state level body <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#67:1:B>
<}> <-> I have </-> <=> we have </=> </}> got more than ten
thousand members <,> all over the state Andhra Pradesh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#68:1:B>
And the president for that <,> for the last fifteen years <,> while
acting also I was so busy as a artist <,> even then I used to <,> uh give lot
of service to the <,> especially this old <?> indigent </?> artist giving
pensions <,> and then getting house <O> one word </O> for them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#69:1:B>
And uh to improve their art to use to give <,> a lot of
encouragement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#70:1:B>
Still I am continuing as a president of Professional Artist Theatre
Federation <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#71:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> returning to the subject of films <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#72:1:A>
Why did you <,> discontinued uh your <,> <{> <[> film career <,,>
yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#73:1:B>
<[> Film career </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#74:1:B>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#75:1:B>
Naturally after uh <,> becoming a <,,> politician <,> I want to
give full uh <,> justice to <,> my <,,> uh profession <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#76:1:B>
I I don't like to put one leg <,> this side one leg <,> in film
field and one leg in politician <,> as a politician <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#77:1:B>
I think we can't <,> do any justice to <,> our <,,> performance

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#78:1:B>
So I want to give up my film career due to <,,> uh <}> <-> <.> po
</.> </-> <=> politics </=> </}>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#79:1:A>
But your family compulsion as well <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#80:1:B>
No not much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#81:1:B>
Because my husband is a very co-operative man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#82:1:B>
And then <,,> <}> <-> <.> sm </.> </-> <=> smoothly </=> </}> going
my family life also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#83:1:B>
I have married <-> to my </-> <,> uh my husband is a <,> Professor
of Zoology <,> at Osmania University <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#84:1:B>
I got <,> uh one son and daughter <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#85:1:B>
So life is going smoothly <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#86:1:A>
They must also be very fond of your old films I am sure

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#87:1:B>
<O> Laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#88:1:A>
There is one question about film I wanted to ask you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#89:1:A>
Do your fans <,> feel still as the screen image that they have of
you <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#90:1:A>
Or do they know that you only act <,> perform roles <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#91:1:A>
How do they react to you when they see you in person <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#92:1:B>
Naturally they are uh <,> very much excited to see as a person

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#93:1:B>
Because uh <,> being a veteran artist for thirty years <,> uh uhm
for example I can say at my Rajmundari constituency I used to go to <,> to
very rural places <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#94:1:B>
So there <,> they were <,> just like uh <,> they are worshipping as
a <,> goddess <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#95:1:B>
So after seeing me naturally they <-> will </-> get lot of uh
excitement

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#96:1:B>
Some people especially <,> uh lady character <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#97:1:B>
I have got <,> lady fans more than <,> uh gents I think so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#98:1:B>
So they used to <,> embrace me and kiss me

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#99:1:B>
They said oh Jamunajee <,> we never thought <w> we'll </w> see you
<,> uh like this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#100:1:B>
So we are very happy <w> we'll </w> vote for you <,> and then you
must do good work for those <,> our uh <,> you should solve our problems

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#101:1:B>
I said I had given a promise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#102:1:B>
So that excitement will be will be there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#103:1:B>
Not on uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#104:1:A>
Cinema has been contributing <,> uh to very large extent <,>
in the south especially it has been throwing up some very <,> interesting <,>
uh politicians <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#105:1:A>
Why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to
<,> uh sorry more and more film personalities in south take to politics <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#106:1:B>
I think as a <,,> citizen of India <,,> every <,> citizen has
<,,> a right to become a politician <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#107:1:B>
Politician means not only a <,> uhm getting some money or getting
fame <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#108:1:B>
We can do service to the public <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#109:1:B>
As a democratic country we have got <,> uh every right to every
man and the woman and every citizen of India they got a right to <,> enter
into the politics there is no restrictions for that <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#110:1:A>
But does their screen image really help them <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#111:1:B>
Sometimes <,,> <{> <[> in this <,> that is image is there <,>
that glamour <,,> will add our political <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#112:1:B>
<[> In this </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#113:1:A>
Does it make your canvassing easier <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#114:1:B>
Not easier <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#115:1:B>
Just like other <O> a few words </O> canvass because now-a-days
<,> uh uh political situation and especially <,> rural masses also <,> there
public has uh <,> got uh political awareness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#116:1:B>
Now <,> they are not uh so easily <,> there now we can't attract
them with glamour all those things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#117:1:B>
The glamour will be there <,> but one should not work <O> one word
</O> very hardly then only we will win <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#118:1:B>
Otherwise not possible

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#119:1:A>
In this modern world where we have television we have news
magazines <,> where they <,> keep telling us that <,> an actor <,> the role
that he performs is just a role <,> he is in fact <,> a simple man like us
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#120:1:A>
There are still these images that people have <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#121:1:A>
How do they maintain <,> how does a man maintain his image <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#122:1:B>
The film ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#123:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#124:1:B>
You see <,,> the film <,> uh maintaining the image <,> one
should have certain principles in personal life also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#125:1:B>
And then he should uh <,> take good characters <,,> representing
<,> some social problems economic problems <,> with a <,> rural character
representing poor <w> family's </w> character <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#126:1:B>
Then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his <,> uh
good image in film field also long <,> long standing image <,> like me <,> I
had so many variety characters <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#127:1:A>
What kind of screen image did you have <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#128:1:B>
I had uh <,,> very good image otherwise I think I should not
say myself it shows <,> uh little bit embarassment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#129:1:B>
Even then I have to say <,> to public that I am I think I am the
first lady to <,> act in two hundred not two hundred films <,> as a heroine
<,> thirty years <,> as a leading lady <,> of south Indian screen I can say
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#130:1:B>
So like that <,,> I got that image in public

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#131:1:A>
How many of your films have won awards <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#132:1:B>
Out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films <,> state
awards <,> and then national awards <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#133:1:B>
While national awards <O> one word </O> to come to Delhi very
often <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#134:1:B>
And Mrs Gandhi was there <,> Information and Broadcasting minister
<,> <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#135:1:B>
And then state awards for so many films <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#136:1:A>
Which is the highest award <,,> that you have got <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#137:1:B>
I think in Hindi film <mention> <indig> Milan </indig>
</mention> is uh highest filmfare <,> filmfare award is there for me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#138:1:B>
And of course in Andhra Pradesh if we <,> state awards and best
actress award <,> in Telugu films I am the first lady <,> continously nine
times I have been elected as a best <,> actress award <,,> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#139:2:A>
Welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#140:2:A>
First of all when we talk about parallel processing and
super-<->computers <,> what are these things <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#141:2:B>
Super-computers really <,> the <,,> amount of data number it
contains <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#142:2:B>
The good old days about thirty years ago <,> big two garages will
contain <,> things <,> with small capability now it comes <,> it control
about ten <indig> crore </indig> of operations

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#143:2:B>
Ten <indig> crores </indig> the hundred mega flops <,> you see <,>
in <,> one second <,> <w> that's </w> type of <,> that is super computing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#144:2:A>
Why do we need it in India <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#145:2:B>
We require it for weather modelling <,> pollution monitering
<,> variety of things

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#146:2:B>
Where ever you need <,> too fast too big <,> these things if you
want to look at <,> you have to now crunch the numbers very fast <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#147:2:B>
Do it <,> and then see what it means <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#148:2:B>
It has a lot of uh <,> uses in these

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#149:2:A>
<indig> Lekin </indig> super computer <indig> ko banane mei
kharcha bahut hota hai Rajan saheb </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#150:2:A>
Is this expenditure justified <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#151:2:B>
<indig> Jyada nahi haan

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#152:2:B>
Yeh jo sidhaant mei jo </indig> development <indig> hoti hai uski
</indig> thirty-six <indig> crore ki cheez hai <,> aur uska jo <,> usse
</indig> benefit <indig> jo hota hai <,> ke </indig> agriculture model
<indig> ho </indig> <,> water modelling <indig> ho </indig> <,> seismic
modelling <indig> ho <,> aur </indig> reactor <indig> ki </indig> safety
<indig> ho </indig> <,> dam <indig> ki </indig> safety <indig> ho </indig>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#153:2:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#162:2:B>
Woh to </indig> future generation

<[> <indig> Accha </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#164:2:A>
And you know since we <,> you know <indig> Jee saheb </indig>
and I are a bit ignorant about <,> technical terms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#165:2:A>
<indig> Yeh </indig> parallel processing would you like to explain
in in simple <,> <{> <[> uh terms </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#166:2:B>
<[> Okay </[> </{> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#167:2:B>
The computer for past thirty years has been doing <,,> do one uh
competition <,> put it in a memory <,> do one competition put it in a memory

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#168:2:B>
It does it very fast but <,> that has a limit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#169:2:B>
When we are thinking in terms of tons and <indig> crore </indig>
<,> that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of
operations <,> per second <,> then <,> this slows down the process

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#170:2:B>
So <,> you do it in a different <,> multiple persons <,> many
brains using in harmony <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#171:2:B>
So actually some computer people say <,> tyranny of the central
memory will be gone <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#172:2:B>
Many many places <,> they all do it in parallel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#173:2:B>
So you can handle large amount of data

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#174:2:B>
That is parallel processing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#175:2:B>
It is essential <,> to <,> advance super computer in later stage
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#176:2:A>
Mr Rajan <w> you're </w> closely involved in monitoring the
development of uh this technology in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#177:2:A>
How far away <,> is India <,> from its own super computer <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#178:2:B>
Not very far <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#179:2:B>
These works which are taking place in C dot <,,> C tac <,,> then
there are the number of parallel processing of course in N A L <,> Indian
Institute of Science <,> D R D O BARC <,> C M C L they are all doing very
well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#180:2:B>
I would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and
second two or three <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#181:2:B>
But in terms of one <,> using the software for various uses
weather forcasting modelling etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#182:2:B>
As well as for these <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#183:2:B>
They are quite <,> in contemporary <,,> to the needs of our
country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#184:2:A>
How <,,> far developed <,> how developed <,> is <w> India's
</w> technology in this field compare to other countries ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#185:2:B>
Contemporary <,> I would say not more than <,> in fact this
technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#186:2:B>
So we are very close to <,> those things

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#187:2:B>
Some of <w> it's </w> developments <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#188:2:A>
And once <w> we've </w> the super computers <,> how will you
<,> Mr Rajan use it <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#189:2:B>
Oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology
forecasting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#190:2:B>
There are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution
monitering even heart stimulation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#191:2:B>
Do anything which you want to look at <,> before designing a car
<,> before designing an aircraft <,> you want to see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#192:2:B>
Do the design there <,> let it crash and see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#193:2:B>
So you can <O> one word </O> build a dam you want to look at
safety <,> anything can be done in the computer <,> without spending any
money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#194:2:B>
Then you look at it <,> then you perfect the design <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#195:2:B>
Many of these things <,> though I myself would not be <,> uh using
it in that form <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#196:2:B>
There are many hundreds of young men and women in the country <,>
who will use it <,> and then they will export even the software <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#197:2:A>
Mr Rajan one last question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#198:2:A>
Gaze into your crystal bowl <,> after the super computer in India
<,> what next <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#199:2:B>
Artificial <}> <-> <.> inte </.> </-> <=> intelligence </=>
</}> <,> fifth generation computer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#200:2:B>
<w> That's </w> what I meant <,> Jee <indig> saheb </indig> he can
have hundreds of them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#201:2:B>
How many other <w> that's </w> right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#202:2:A>
<w> You're </w> obviously excited about the developments
taking place <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#203:2:B>
Thank you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-043#204:2:A>
And we certainly have shared the excitement <indig> Jee saheb
jinhone bataya </indig> super computer <indig> ke bare mein </indig>

Our guest this morning was Mr Y S Rajan <,> adviser in Department
of Science and Technology <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-043#208:2:A>
<w> We've </w> been talking to him about the exciting break
through in the field of parallel processing and super computer development in
India <,> </I>
