<h> Does Religion Divide ? </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#2:1>
Religion is a pure and a <}> <-> holly </-> <+> holy </+> </}>
aspect created by man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#3:1>
The man <-> who </-> is not satisfied till now.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#4:1>
Just as Ruskin Bond says that <quote> " Man is the only wealth on the
Earth" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#5:1>
<}> <-> in </-> <+> In </+> </}> the same way each individual <}> <->
say </-> <+> says </+> </}> that Religion is the only <del> thing </del>
wealth which he follows in his <}> <-> lifehood. </-> <+> livelihood. </+>
</}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#6:1>
Religion is created by man; as man was created by God what is
Religion?

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#7:1>
Religion is nothing but <}> <-> its </-> <+> <w> it's </w> </+> </}>
the only way or <w> it's </w> a medium to find God or to go nearer to God, or
to approach God.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#8:1>
And to do this great thing people started their <del> wor </del>
procedure in different ways.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#9:1>
Those who followed the way <del> of </del> invented a new religion
started <-> to </-> propoganda & <del> made </del> named it a serious &
stupid one say as a <quote> " Religion" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#10:1>
If it is observed no Religion teaches us how to go to hell.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#11:1>
All religions <}> <-> teaches </-> <+> teach </+> </}> one & the only
thing that is God is great, created the universe, and do good things in your
life you will be soon helped by <-> the </-> God.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#12:1>
But no <del> religion</del> religious book <}> <-> specify </-> <+>
specifies </+> </}> that you should not follow other religion & other <del> g
</del> God.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#13:1>
All the human beings say that their religion is the only original
religion & thus it was created universally & it is the oldest of any other
religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#14:1>
Is it true?

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#15:1>
No.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#16:1>
<del> But no men say that </del> The oldest one is man & the earth.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#17:1>
The way to seek God is a Religion & the way to get the religion is do
your work sincerely, obey your elders, follow what is good, and many other
such things which could please the other men.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#18:1>
To please our friends & all the creatures in the earth is the only
way to go to God & <w> that's </w> called a religion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#19:1>
But now a days people are after money, and any how they are
making money as their religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#20:1>
Money is the only source to make many friends.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#21:1>
And to earn money man started exploiting other religion & other men.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#22:1>
Elections are to be held only at the base of money.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#23:1>
The ministers give speeches and those speeches are related to
religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#24:1>
<&> asterisk </&> Religion was the only cause we the Indians were
ruled by the Britishers for 200 yrs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#25:1>
Religion was the only cause we people got <}> <-> seperated </-> <+>
separated </+> </}> into Pak & India and religion was the only reason why
still the Indians are <del> as </del> so backward country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#26:1>
Today even in India if you go and ask any citizen of India
<quote> <w> " what's </w> your name? and who are you <}> <-> . </-> <+> ? "
</+> </}> </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#27:1>
<}> <-> Their's </-> <+> their </+> </}> first reply would be <quote>
<+> " </+> my name is so & so and I am a Maharashtrian or I am from Gujarat
or from <}> <-> tamil nadu </-> <+> Tamil Nadu </+> </}> or any thing else,
but they never say <quote> <+> " </+> I am an Indian. <+> " </+> </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#28:1>
Religion is the only thing what we the Indian citizen need to know
first & then later their qualifications & etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#29:1>
This is a very <}> <-> tipical </-> <+> typical </+> </}> nature of
the Indians.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#30:1>
We know in Indian history many kings & warriors have sacrificed their
lives only just only for their mother land and not for their religion, but
nowadays people of India elect and sell their mother land just because of the
silly religion, and they do not feel sorry when <}> <-> the </-> <+> they
</+> </}> get hurt from those leaders.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#31:1>
The leaders enjoy their leadership and to get the same again they
introduce the same religion problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#32:1>
Indians are still stressing on religion, but can we guess, when we
are getting rid of this religion?

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#33:1>
<}> <-> Its </-> <+> <w> It's </w> </+> </}> too difficult.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#34:1>
Hence the religion problem in our country can't be removed at any
cost.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#35:1>
Our Father of Nation Gandhiji expected India to be a <}> <->
socialists </-> <+> socialist </+> </}> & secular nation, he dreamt India to
be as a <indig> <quote> " Ram Raj" </quote> </indig> <-> with </-> full of
peace without any discrimination of caste, colour and creed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#36:1>
But all in vain.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#37:1>
Now people instead of following Gandhiji, & think they have almost
forgotten our great <indig> Ahimsa </indig> King Mahatma Gandhiji. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#38:1>
If the stupid religion would not be invented then imagine what
would have <}> <-> a happen. </-> <+> happened. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#39:1>
No wonder there could be peace, but <*> dotted line </*> <}> <-> ;
Early </-> <+> , early </+> </}> in the morning people would get up and they
all would have come together, happily they would have gone to pray & then go
to their respective <}> <-> job. </-> <+> jobs. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#40:1>
Later they would have discussed about their living being.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#41:1>
What actually a man needs <}> <-> , </-> <+> are </+> </}> Food,
Clothing & Shelter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#42:1>
The they would have been distributed in <}> <-> 03 </-> <+> three
</+> </}> different aspects & start working harder and harder for earning
their <}> <-> living thing. </-> <+> livelihood. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#43:1>
No <}> <-> men </-> <+> man </+> </}> would have enough time to chit
<-> & </-> chat about the religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#44:1>
And hence there would have been no caste & creed, no blacks & whites
& no Indians & Pakistinis.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#45:1>
All would have been one and such a peaceful life would have been <}>
<-> dealt. </-> <+> there. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#46:1>
According to me there should not be religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#47:1>
If there would be religion then there should only be one religion
which should not differentiate any king or a <indig> Shatriya, Brahaman
Vaishya </indig> & <indig> Shudra </indig> nor any <indig> shias </indig> and
<indig> sunnis </indig> or <-> nor </-> Roman Catholic, or <}> <->
Protestions </-> <+> Protestants </+> </}> or any thing else, then it can be
called as a pure religion. <del> one </del> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#48:1>
Now a days religion is used as a weapon at any part of their
life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#49:1>
If you go any unknown <w> person's </w> house, no wonder they would
ask <del> for </del> water for you but before that they ask your name & then
slowly your religion, if it is nearer to the hosts religion then their
hospitality would be good, but if it is not then they would <}> <-> repel
</-> <+> drive </+> </}> you out.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#50:1>
In the same way if a Hindu goes to a mosque the people present there
would be <}> <-> surprise </-> <+> surprised </+> </}> to see him there &
when he goes out the people of his religion would anxiously ask about their
minus points in the mosque.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#51:1>
This way various religion people like their own religion to be
superior & the one & the only ancient religion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#52:1>
They would not like the other religion to be praised or <}> <->
compare </-> <+> compared </+> </}> to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#53:1>
Hence it is true that though religion is <}> <-> a </-> <+> an
</+> </}> abstract thing & it is invented by man and the same <del> ma </del>
man <}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+> </}> the one who made different religions
and they are the <}> <-> one </-> <+> ones </+> </}> who distributed men into
various classes, but they are the <}> <-> one </-> <+> ones </+> </}> who are
always fighting against each other, though they <}> <-> knew </-> <+> know
</+> </}> that religion is not created by God.

<ICE-IND:W1A-003#54:1>
So it is obvious that religions divide, but if man still beleives in
the <}> <-> superlated religion </-> <+> super-religion </+> </}> soon
they would forget the <w> almighty's </w> creation & start killing the whole
world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-003#55:1>
Hence it is good to say follow all religions and take or grasp
only the good and best things that are followed from all the religions. </p>
