<ICE-IND:S2A-057#1:1:A>
I think some of you who have <,,> seen the last programme would  
be <,> ready with your sticks <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#2:1:A>
So <,,> <w> let's </w> get started <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#3:1:A>
As you remember last time you saw <,,> how the stick was held <,>  
and also saw <,> a few basic steps <,> and <,,> a few basic strokes <,> with  
the stick <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#4:1:A>
Now <,,> those of you who are familiar <,> with <,> the word <indig>  
kaata </indig> or <,,> familiar with Judo or Karate <,> would know what the  
word <,> <indig> kaata </indig> means <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#5:1:A>
But for those of you who <,,> do not know the word <indig> kaata <,>  
kaata </indig> is a fixed <,> prearranged form of excercise <,> done in <,>  
many marshal arts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#6:1:A>
It is either done solo <,> or <,> performed with a partner <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#7:1:A>
These exercises are repeated <,> till all the movements become  
smooth <,> easy and spontaneous 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#8:1:A>
Now <,,> in stick fighting also <,> we have got these <,> fixed <,>  
or prearranged <,> type of exercises <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#9:1:A>
But <,,> because of the different styles involved <,> and the  
different names <,> at the moment <,> for the sake of convenience <,> <w>  
let's </w> call them <,> <indig> kaatas </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#10:1:A>
Last time you saw <,> Kanduraburakailugaru doing some <,> basic  
steps 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#11:1:A>
Now <,> <w> let's </w> take a look at him <,> doing <,> a few  
<indig> kaatas </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#12:1:A>
Here in this <indig> kaata </indig> <,> only two strokes <,> or hit  
<,,> or <,,> I should say hit <,> are being practised <,,> the right <,> and  
the left <,,> but in different directions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#13:1:A>
Note that only <,> these two basic strokes are used <,> but <,> in  
all the four directions of the <O> one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#14:1:A>
Incidently <,,> Guruburakailu is one of those <,> few masters <,>  
who travel from village to village <,> rarely staying more than a few months  
at one place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#15:1:A>
A few students <,,> pay him a small sum for his services but <,,>  
mostly <,,> rice <,> or wheat <,> is the only payment he gets <,> for  
teaching them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#16:1:A>
There he is finishing off the <indig> kaata </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#17:1:A>
That is the traditional <indig> salami </indig> <,> or salutation  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#18:1:A>
Now <,> in this <indig> kaata </indig> <,,> he <}> <-> start </->  
<+> starts </+> </}> the same way as before but uh <,> this time <,> with the  
stroke on the head <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#19:1:A>
Two more strokes <,,> start from down <,> two more parallel to the  
ground <,,> and a stroke towards the back <,> then he turns <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#20:1:A>
He does the same thing over again <,,> towards <,> this side also  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#21:1:A>
Now <,> he is finishing the fourth side <,,> and <,,> here he comes  
forward <,> for the fifth time <,,> there he turns <,> and goes back <,,> and  
finishes the exercise <,,> with uh <,> traditional salutation or <,> <indig>  
salami </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#22:1:A>
But before the <indig> salami </indig> <,> he is doing the <,,>  
basic strokes again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#23:1:A>
The <indig> salami </indig> usually is done before and after <,,>  
each exercise <,,> in <,> all the traditional art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#24:1:A>
Now <,> this time <,> he add a double stroke to the head <,,> and  
then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#25:1:A>
But he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#26:1:A>
Then he turns <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#27:1:A>
Here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down <,,> and  
ends up <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#28:1:A>
Note how graceful and smooth the movements are <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#29:1:A>
The synchronization of <,,> the movements <,> the hormony between  
the hands and the feet <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#30:1:A>
For this reason <,,> new movements are gradually introduced <,> in  
each new exercise till all the movements become <,> effortless <,> and  
spontaneous <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#31:1:A>
Well though there are <,> more than twenty such exercises <,,> in  
the Udaygiri style <,> <w> we'll </w> take a look at only <,> one more <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#32:1:A>
Well in <,,> this final <indig> kaata </indig> <,,> all the  
movements <,,> will be done in a circular way <,> but <,> before the movement  
starts <,,> a poke or a thrust <,,> repeats the movement <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#33:1:A>
Watch <,,> he finished the circular <,> strokes and now <,,> the  
thrust or the poke starts <,> with the throat <,> as the target <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#34:1:A>
There it is <,,> the thrust <,,> and the circular movements <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#35:1:A>
Note that the stick <,,> never seems to stop <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#36:1:A>
It keeps on moving <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#37:1:A>
This is <,,> in defence <,> as well as <,> in offence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#38:1:A>
The stick always covers the body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#39:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> it <,,> <w> that's </w> the <indig> salami  
</indig> <,> or the <,> salutation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#40:1:A>
These are some <,> basic exercises <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#41:1:A>
After learning these <,> the students <,> learns <,> how to hit  
<,,> that means he learns the blows and the hits <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#42:1:A>
Now here <,> the need or the necessity of a partner <,> is  
important <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#43:1:A>
This is also done in a <,> fixed <,> prearranged form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#44:1:A>
The reason is that <,,> if it is not fixed and prearranged <,> the  
<,,> chances of injury <,> are more <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#45:1:A>
But <,> gradually as the skill <,> of the person increases <,,>  
then he could indulge in free fightings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#46:1:A>
Loosening up or <,> warming up <,,> Guruburakailu moves forward  
<,,> to take the <indig> salami </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#47:1:A>
This is his student <,,> Ramalingaraju <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#48:1:A>
There <,> they have done the <indig> salami </indig> <,,> and now  
they move back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#49:1:A>
Now he comes forward <,> for the basic hits which are <,> usually  
done <,,> before the start of each <indig> kaata </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#50:1:A>
And now the exercise starts which has got <,> nine hits <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#51:1:A>
This time they do <,,> fifteen hits <,> in this <indig> kaata  
</indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#52:1:A>
First the <,,> basic blows <,,> <w> that's </w> the <?> deceptic  
</?> blow to the ankle <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#53:1:A>
One two <,> three four <,> five six seven eight nine <,> ten eleven  
<,,> twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#54:1:A>
Now <,,> in <,> this exercise <,,> other than the nine basic hits  
<,,> there are <,> twelve more hits which are added to this <,,> making a  
total of <,,> twenty-one <,,> strokes or blows <,,> <&> sound of sticks </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#55:1:A>
And they finish it off <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#56:1:A>
Now <,> comparatively this set is <,> more difficult than the  
previous one though there are only four blows involved <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#57:1:A>
The basic hit <,,> and the exercise starts <,,> one <,> two <,>  
three <,> four <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#58:1:A>
Timing is very important in this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#59:1:A>
Ah that was the reverse stroke <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#60:1:A>
Again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#61:1:A>
This exercise is also the same <,,> practically the same as before  
but uh <,,> instead of the first hit <,,> the first blow <,> or the stroke is  
the <,> thrust at the throat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#62:1:A>
And the same basic fourth blow <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#63:1:A>
Rhythm and timing is very important here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#64:1:A>
There the <,> rhythm has been changed <,> to a double blow <,,>  
from down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#65:1:A>
Now <,,> this <indig> kaata </indig> is similar to the last <,,>  
two you saw <,> but <,> here there are <,,> ten hits <,> rather than <,> four  
blows which you saw <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#66:1:A>
They have named it the <mention> Jhapak </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#67:1:A>
Timing and a keen eye is very important here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#68:1:A>
Well we can go on and on <,,> for there are <,> many such exercises  
but <,,> <w> let's </w> not do that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#69:1:A>
Uh <,> <w> we've </w> to take a look at only <,> one more <,> <w>  
that's </w> from the <,,> Udaygiricheda school <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#70:1:A>
Here they are finishing this <,> and <,> now <w> we'll </w> move on  
to the <,> last exercise <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#71:1:A>
Here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#72:1:A>
This is <,> something like <,> free fighting sparring <,,> and the  
hits are spontaneous <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#73:1:A>
Now this type of practise or <,,> fighting is done <,> when the  
student has already learnt <,,> the stick forms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#74:1:A>
This is helpful <,,> in <,,> the actual use of a stick that is <,>  
when a <,,> competitor fights <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#75:1:A>
Though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only  
held in <,,> some villages <,> and not in the cities <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#76:1:A>
Uh <,> in competition <,> the stick is sometimes coloured <,,> so  
that <,,> if the stick touches <,> it could show <,> where it was touched <,>  
ah that was the <,,> close one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#77:1:A>
But the master is <,,> directing the students <,,> movement <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#78:1:A>
Though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#79:1:A>
These are a few <indig> kaatas </indig> from the <,,> Udaygiricheda  
school <,> or the <,> Udaygiri style of stick fighting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#80:1:A>
Now <,,> to some <,,> it may seem paradoxical <,> but <,> in many  
fighting arts of the east <,,> medicine <,,> and healing <,,> play a very  
important role <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#81:1:A>
Many masters are <indig> vaidya <,> hakims </indig> or bone setters  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#82:1:A>
One such master <,,> was the late Shafi <indig> ustad </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#83:1:A>
The tradition is being carried out <,> by his student <,,> Khalifa  
Gulam Rasool <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#84:1:A>
Mending broken bones <,,> is his profession <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#85:1:A>
He has learnt the secrets of <,,> herbs <,,> oil <,,> and healing  
lotions <,,> from his late master <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#86:1:A>
And now he makes his own medicines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#87:1:A>
Gulam Rasool is a <,,> very busy man with a very tight schedule  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#88:1:A>
Right from <,> dawn <,> to late in the night <,,> he is at his  
clinic <,,> where he looks after <,> his patients <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#89:1:A>
Though sometimes when he is <,> not very busy <,,> he teaches <,,>  
stick fighting also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#90:1:A>
No matter what ones faith is <,,> devotion and prayer <,,> play an  
important part in ones training <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#91:1:A>
Here Khalifa Gulam Rasool gets ready for an exercise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#92:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the <indig> salami </indig> <,,> and he starts with  
both the sticks rotating <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#93:1:A>
This <,,> exercise is known as <indig> chaadar </indig> <,> or a  
bedsheet <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#94:1:A>
It is <,> appropriately named because uh <,> sticks are covering  
the body like a bedsheet would <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#95:1:A>
Both the sticks are moving <,,> at the same time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#96:1:A>
This is used to keep <,,> people away from you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#97:1:A>
And the <w> that's </w> the <,> finish of the exercise with the <,>  
traditional <indig> salami </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#98:1:A>
Gulam <w> Rasool's </w> son <,> Gulam Moiuddin is on the left <,,>  
and Karim <,> is on the right <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#99:1:A>
They are doing <indig> salami </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#100:1:A>
And now the work starts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#101:1:A>
This is the simple exercise with just <,> four hits <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#102:1:A>
There they finish off <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#103:1:A>
Now <,> here is something interesting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#104:1:A>
Other than blows and thrust <,> which you saw in the <,> Udaygiri  
style <,> here the <indig> lathi </indig> <,> or the stick is also used <,>  
to lock the joints <,,> and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting  
him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#105:1:A>
These are known as <,> <indig> bandish </indig> <,> or <,> <w>  
let's </w> call them <,> locks <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#106:1:A>
Here the elbow has been locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#107:1:A>
Abdul Samadh <,> his student <,,> and <,,> the elbow and the  
shoulder <,,> is locked here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#108:1:A>
The wrist also seems to be locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#109:1:A>
That is a good one <,,> the elbow has been locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#110:1:A>
<w> That's </w> sure <w> it's </w> painful <,> the neck has been  
locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#111:1:A>
Now there are two sticks being used <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#112:1:A>
Well <,> one arm <,> the other arm has also been locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#113:1:A>
Both the arms are captured <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#114:1:A>
Well <,> <w> that's </w> the strangle <,> or a <,> choke <,> on  
the throat <,,> with the elbow also locked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#115:1:A>
You have seen two <,> different styles <,> or types <,> of stick  
fightings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#116:1:A>
Now <,> I would like to show you a few basics <,> which could be  
learnt <,> easily by you <,> and put to good use <,> if the situation demands  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#117:1:A>
But <,,> let me tell you something <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#118:1:A>
Do not misuse the sticks <,> give it the respect <,> it deserves  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#119:1:A>
But uh <,,> before we start <,,> <w> let's </w> take a look at  
what we did <,,> last time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#120:1:A>
In <,> various styles there are various hits and blows 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#121:1:A>
But <,,> basically <,,> there are just seven hits with the stick  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#122:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> do them slowly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#123:1:A>
From your basic stance <,,> lift your hands up <,,> and get your  
hands down again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#124:1:A>
This is the first <,> basic hit <,> on the head <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#125:1:A>
It comes straight down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#126:1:A>
The second hit is <,,> sloping from up <,> to down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#127:1:A>
The third again <,,> from up to down <,> slanting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#128:1:A>
Fourth is <,,> parallel to the ground <,,> fifth is also parallel  
to the ground <,,> sixth comes from <,> down to up <,,> and seventh is also  
<,> from down <,> to up <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#129:1:A>
And of course <,,> there are <,> point of the stick <,> is also  
used <,> to <,> thrust or poke <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#130:1:A>
What you saw were the <,,> seven basic strokes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#131:1:A>
Now <,> <w> I'll </w> show you a simple <,> basic exercise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#132:1:A>
Now usually <,> in stick fighting <,> when the <,> stick is  
brought over head <,> or <,> from the side <,,> the leg also moves with the  
stick <,> that is <,> what I am trying to say is that <,> if the stick comes  
from your <,> right side <,,> the leg also moves forward <,> or if it comes  
from the left side <,> then the <,> left leg moves forward <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#133:1:A>
Now this is not a very hard and fast rule <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#134:1:A>
It is flexible <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#135:1:A>
Sometimes <,> even <,,> when the stroke is coming from the other  
side <,,> the step may not be taken <,,> that is <,> the right leg is in  
front <,> but <,> the left stroke comes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#136:1:A>
Let us not think of this at the moment <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#137:1:A>
At the moment <,> when we <,> get the stick out <,> we will <,>  
step forward <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#138:1:A>
So <,,> from here from your basic start or your basic stance <,>  
lift your hands <,> up <,> over your head <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#139:1:A>
Now <,> in this movement <,> you have blocked the opponents stick  
<,> or you have blocked <,> a blow <,> to your head <,> and protected  
yourself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#140:1:A>
From here <,,> take a step forward <,,> hit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#141:1:A>
Take one more step forward <,,> hit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#142:1:A>
Now what happens you can rotate to the <,> left side <,> or the  
right side <,> or the back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#143:1:A>
Now <w> I'll </w> move to the <,> left <,> watch <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#144:1:A>
Again <w> I'll </w> go towards <,> my back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-057#145:1:A>
What I have done is that I have taken a complete <,,> circle <,>
