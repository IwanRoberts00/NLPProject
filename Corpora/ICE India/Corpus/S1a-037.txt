<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#1:1:A>
See yesterday I ran into Smita <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#2:1:A>
So uhm <,> her friend Laxshmi she was suffering from <,> her father
was suffering from asthama <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#3:1:A>
So here he has been admitted in the Hospital somewhere in
Rajarampuri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#4:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#5:1:B>
Who is the doctor <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#6:1:A>
Some Irani Irani <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#7:1:A>
So <,> I checked the reports of his blood you know <,> all were
normal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#8:1:A>
But the doctor is saying <w> there's </w> a <.> pu </.> puss
formation in the lungs

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#9:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#10:1:A>
So I asked him <,> I asked him <,> what treatment <}> <-> does
</-> <+> is </+> </}> he going to give <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#11:1:A>
So his thinking is that <,> it can be removed only by surgery <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#12:1:B>
But we can do <,> even homeopathy for that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#13:1:C>
Yeah <{> <[> I know </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#14:1:D>
<[> Homeopathy is the </[> </{> best treatment you know <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#15:1:A>
<w> I've </w> even I was <,> telling her the same thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#16:1:A>
But then she said <indig> ki </indig> <,> I said see the puss
formation is going to <,> take place again after the surgery <,> <{> <[> uhm
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#17:1:A>
And asthama is such a <,,> <{1> <[1> disease </[1> that it can be
completely cured by <{2> <[2> homeopathy </[2> only

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#18:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#19:1:C>
<[1> Disease </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#20:1:C>
<[2> Homeopathy </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#21:1:B>
You just <.> ad </.> advise her then <,,> if if she wants

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#22:1:A>
But her father you know he <,,> he is against restrictions of
eating and drinking <,,> like he wants to <{> <[> drink </[> coffee all the
time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#23:1:A>
He drinks at least ten cups of coffee <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#24:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#25:1:B>
But that is an antidote again <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#26:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#27:1:C>
Coffee coffee and <{> <[> onion </[> raw onion <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#28:1:D>
<[> Onion </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#29:1:B>
That is an anitidote <indig> na </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#30:1:B>
You can try again <,,> because if the performance is <,,> <{> <[>
it can be cured </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#31:1:C>
<[> Asthama can be </[> </{> cured <,> in a sense asthama and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#32:1:A>
But he is not ready to listen <indig> na </indig> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#33:1:C>
Uhm uhm <w> that's </w> why <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#34:1:B>
He doesn't listen only

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#35:1:C>
But you can try again

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#36:1:B>
Very stubborn person <O> laughter </O> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#37:1:C>
We can try again <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#38:1:D>
<w> What's </w> wrong in trying again <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#39:1:A>
I don't know they had referred to some doctor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#40:1:A>
But then he doesn't <,> pay attention to all this <indig> na
</indig> <,> all these things <,> you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion
etcetra

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#41:1:B>
Only these two things and what else he has to follow <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#42:1:A>
Do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't
believe in homeopathy <O> cough <O> <,> there lies his problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#43:1:B>
People don't know about homeopathy

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#44:1:D>
Yeah <w> that's </w> why <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#45:1:A>
<w> That's </w> it <indig> na </indig> so I told him <indig>
ki </indig> <w> Shireen's </w> dad was also suffering from asthama <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#46:1:A>
Even Shireen was <,> <{> <[> even <,> saying <indig> ki </indig>
her dad was suffering from asthama and <O> cough </O> uh one of her uncles is
a homeopath <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#47:1:A>
He was a allopath before <,> but then afterwards he studied
homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#48:1:B>
<[> Even </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#49:1:B>
There are many people that way

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#50:1:A>
Yeah even Dr Shinde <{> <[> etcetra </[>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#51:1:A>
So then <,,> uh like <w> Shireen's </w> father <,> was cured by <,>
his uncle <indig> na </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#52:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#53:1:C>
Her uncle

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#54:1:B>
Her uncle

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#55:1:C>
Even my mummy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#56:1:A>
Now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know <,> not
at all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#57:1:B>
Yeah why don't you try to convince him <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#58:1:A>
I I didn't try to convince him <,> I tried to convince Laxshmi
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#59:1:A>
First of all you will have to convince Laxshmi

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#60:1:D>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#61:1:B>
Yeah we can even <O> one or two words </O> family there are
<.> pe </.> people

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#62:1:D>
You should have said <indig> ki </indig> <w> what's </w> the
harm of trying just trying it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#63:1:B>
<w> There's </w> no side effects of homeopathy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#64:1:B>
Anyway <w> he's </w> not going to get <.> ano </.> another disease

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#65:1:A>
He doesn't believe in that <,> that small <O> one word </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#66:1:C>
<O> One or two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#67:1:A>
Those are going to create a effect <,> and that his asthama
<,> which is almost I mean <,> <w> it's </w> very chronic <,> that is going
to <{> <[> disappear </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#68:1:B>
<[> We can </[> </{> take him to some doctor like <,> <{1>
<[1> who who are </[1> the renowned homeopath <{2> <[2> in </[2> Kolhapur

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#69:1:A>
<[1> Shinde and all <indig> na </indig> </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#70:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#71:1:C>
Maybe they will <,> uh convince him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#72:1:B>
Because that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#73:1:A>
Because finally what are in his <,> we don't have any uh <,> I
mean we don't want to earn and all that <,> we just want to cure like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#74:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> what the thing is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#75:1:B>
We can take him to a homeopath <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#76:1:B>
We can ask the homeopath to <,> make that interest in that person
<,> because at this age if he if it is <O> one word </O> than a surgery <,>
<{> <[> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#77:1:B>
I don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the
things back

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#78:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#79:1:C>
And now he is quite old no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#80:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> what

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#81:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#82:1:A>
At this age if is he going to have any surgery <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#83:1:C>
<w> He's </w> almost seventy over <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#84:1:A>
Seven no sixty-five <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#85:1:C>
Sixty-five

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#86:1:B>
Still but won't be able to <.> reg </.> regain all his health
<,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#87:1:D>
Yeah that is also true <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#88:1:C>
Even my mummy is suffering <,> was suffering from rheumatism
<indig> na </indig> <,> she has taken

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#89:1:A>
Rheumatism is other horrible disease

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#90:1:D>
Yeah Rheumatism and we cured by allopathy

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#91:1:C>
No <{> <[> there are some diseases </[> you know like which
can be cured by homeopathy only

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#92:1:D>
<[> She had taken the treatment </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#93:1:B>
Yeah only homoeopathy

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#94:1:C>
And the one is the is the uh <{> <[> rheumatism </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#95:1:B>
<[> Rheumatism </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#96:1:C>
Rheumatism

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#97:1:A>
Then skin diseases stones <,> kidney stones you know I am
telling you <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> only homeopathy can cure it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#98:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#99:1:A>
The stones can be passed to the urine only by <,> homeopathic
medicine

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#100:1:B>
But that is one problem the people don't believe in
homeopathy still <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#101:1:C>
But now-a-days many people are diverting <{> <[> to
homeopathy </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#102:1:D>
<[> But the even </[> </{> the allopth is preferred

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#103:1:B>
But that is only in the urban uh cities <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#104:1:C>
Yeah precisely they are MBS actually MBBS no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#105:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#106:1:C>
Then <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#107:1:B>
But giving a homeopathic treatment

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#108:1:A>
In the rural areas <,> yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#109:1:B>
These propoganda should be made <indig> na </indig> about
homeopathy <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#110:1:D>
<w> Let's </w> see when we become doctors <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#111:1:D>
<w> We'll </w> try

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#112:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> try our level best

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#113:1:C>
Actually right from now we should start the start <,,> I mean
uh to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#114:1:A>
Yeah creating

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#115:1:C>
I mean we should as soon as we learn <O> one word </O> we
should start giving the medicine know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#116:1:B>
We should let other people know importance of homeopathy and
how <,> it cure up the disease <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#117:1:C>
Even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#118:1:A>
Yeah

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#119:1:D>
Yeah psycho psycho

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#120:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#121:1:D>
<O> One word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#122:1:A>
Because each <,> each persons constitution is different <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#123:1:B>
Allopathy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#124:1:A>
Allopathy <{1> <[1> what they do </[1> what they do you know
<,> like know <,> we all are suffering from <,> a common disease <,> say
fever <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#125:1:A>
They will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone <,>
<{2> <[2> like </[2>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#126:1:A>
But homeopathy doesn't see that <,> first he will know her
constitution is weak your constitution is tough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#127:1:A>
So it depends <indig> na </indig> like <,> for her <w> I'll </w>
give some else <,> medicine the doctor will give you something else <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#128:1:C>
<[1> No you <O> one word </O> </[1> </{1>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#129:1:D>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#130:1:C>
I know that is a <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#131:1:A>
When they give preference to <,> physical <,> over individual
constitution as well as mental constitution <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#132:1:B>
We can find even uh <,> each and every constitution we see
<,> the crowd also we can get many <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> definitely <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#133:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#134:1:C>
And we can distinguish between them <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#135:1:A>
I hope

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#136:1:B>
But the homeopath has to <,> have that knowledge <,,> over
the material

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#137:1:D>
Material and uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#138:1:C>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#139:1:B>
If he is wrong somewhere <,> whole practice is going to

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#140:1:C>
But actually homeopathy has no side effects <indig> na
</indig> so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#141:1:B>
But still

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#142:1:D>
So when that <{> <[> one is going </[> to <.> ha </.> happen
and we have <O> one or two word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#143:1:B>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#144:1:D>
But by reputation you can do it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#145:1:B>
But he has to have his reputation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#146:1:B>
If the <O> one word </O> if he gets

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#147:1:A>
No <indig> yaar </indig> <,> now even I a normal doctor <,>
like even a MBBS doctor <,> he takes five years <indig> yaar </indig> to
settle himself <,> in any town <,> or a city <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#148:1:B>
But he has to increase the <,,> power in that <,> patient
like today

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#149:1:C>
Today <O> one word </O> sir was not saying or what <,> if you
treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#150:1:D>
Yeah yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#151:1:A>
And he will create a broad board of you that this is the
doctor <,> he will refer all the patient go to this doctor and all that <,>
<{> <[> <w> that's </w> there <,,> and then you become famous <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#152:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> there </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#153:1:B>
You may have the tact <indig> yaar </indig>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#154:1:D>
Really

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#155:1:A>
Tact is <O> two words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#156:1:B>
I think Mane sir has that tact you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#157:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#158:1:B>
See he has got the <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#159:1:A>
And Pratap Kulkarni <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#160:1:D>
Pratap Kulkarni <,> he is also very

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#161:1:C>
<w> He's </w> an homeopath

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#162:1:B>
Then what <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#163:1:C>
I didn't know that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#164:1:B>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#165:1:A>
Of course he was a student from

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#166:1:B>
No he was not

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#167:1:C>
No no <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#168:1:D>
He was from our college <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#169:1:A>
<w> He's </w> a good homeopath <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#170:1:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#171:1:A>
I didn't know <indig> yaar </indig> really <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#172:1:D>
Even I <O> one or two words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#173:1:B>
But how come

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#174:1:C>

Yeah <w> he's </w> not going to get back his certificates and
money <indig> na </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#217:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#218:1:A>
That is okay

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#219:1:C>
Instead of wasting thirty thousand <,> and again fifty
thousand in <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#220:1:A>
Yeah now <w> he'll </w> have to give donation in D H M S

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#222:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#225:1:C>
No somebody told me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#226:1:A>
What about Archana

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#227:1:C>
<w> She's </w> taken her <,> <{> <[> Archana <,> <w> she's
</w> taken some short course <,> computer and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#228:1:A>
<[> Archana </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#229:1:A>
One year course

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#230:1:C>
She can complete her <,> this thing graduation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#231:1:A>
No <{> <[> but uh about her L C and certificate </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#232:1:C>
<[> That will also take take a long time </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#233:1:C>
And I think she will take out duplicate <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#234:1:D>
Duplicate <,> from where

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#235:1:A>
Bombay

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#236:1:C>
Bombay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#237:1:B>
We get

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#238:1:A>
Then how they got their mark list and <,> leaving certificate
in duplicate

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#239:1:C>
That is the main thing <,> when you get a mark list you get a
leaving certificate <w> that's </w> what I enquired you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#240:1:C>
But again that caste certificate problem has arrived <indig> na
</indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#241:1:A>
She will do when she have when she will have to take a
passport <,> for this thing backward <O> one word </O> <{> <[> certificate
</[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#242:1:C>
<[> Certificates <indig> na </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#243:1:A>
But if you need a for the passport you need <O> one word </O>
duplicate do <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#244:1:C>
No I don't suppose <,> but you need always <{> <[> orignals
</[>

<ICE-IND:S1A-037#245:1:C>
If she has a passport <w> it's </w> well and good otherwise great
problem <indig> yaar </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#246:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#247:1:A>
That she has I think

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#248:1:C>
Therfore she has to she will have to take help from her
father-in-law <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#249:1:A>
Yeah that way her father-in-law is quite <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#250:1:C>
But <w> it's </w> better <indig> ki </indig> have an original

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-037#251:1:A>
I know <,,> now <w> it's </w> impossible </I>
