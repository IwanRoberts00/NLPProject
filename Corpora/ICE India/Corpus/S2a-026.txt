<ICE-IND:S2A-026#1:1:A>
The Vice-chancellor of <,,> Goa University <,,> and <w> today's  
</w> chief guest <,> Dr Dubhashi <,,> Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Shivaji  
University <,> Dr Yadav <,,> Dr Fernandes <,> Dr Devasthali <,,> my  
colleagues from the Shivaji University <,> and the participants in this  
orientation programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#2:1:A>
It is a pleasure to be associated <,,> with the inauguration of the  
twenty-second <,> orientation programme being <,> organized <,> by the  
academic staff college of Goa University <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#3:1:A>
This also happens to be the <,> second programme we are organizing  
in Kolhapur <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#4:1:A>
And I am grateful <,,> to the Vice-Chancellor of Goa University and  
to his colleagues <,> for taking all trouble of <}> <-> <.> co </.> </-> <=>  
coming </=> </}> over to Kolhapur every year <,> and organizing <,,> such a  
programme 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#5:1:A>
Without <,,> this attitude of yours I think it may have been  
difficult for <,> many of our lady participants to take advantage <,> of <,>  
the facility which the University Grants Commission is offering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#6:1:A>
At the outset <,,> I would like to welcome Dr Dubhashi <,> to this  
campus <,,> on a formal basis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#7:1:A>
He has visited us <,> on a couple of occasions <,> but <-> was </->  
<,> that was more of a personal visit <,> and today we have had the pleasure  
of having him here <,> to give the key note address of this orientation  
programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#8:1:A>
Dr Dubhashi <,> enjoys a unique position amongst the  
vice-Chancellors of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#9:1:A>
Most vice-Chancellors like myself <,,> look upon the job <,> from  
inwards <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#10:1:A>
We have been a part of the university system <,> and we see <,>  
only <,> what we have been seeing for say twenty-five thirty years <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#11:1:A>
But Dr Dubhashi being an administrator <,> and an administrator  
<foreign> par excellence </foreign> <,> has the advantage of looking at the  
education system from outside <,> after taking into account <,> what is  
present therein <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#12:1:A>
And I am sure <,,> <-> this </-> <,,> these two factors <,> being  
able to see <,> from the view point of others <,> and to able to understand  
your own problems <,> will go <,> a long way <,> in seeing that <,> the Goa  
University <,> develops at a very rapid rate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#13:1:A>
I have had the <,> previlege of hearing him at two or three  
conferences <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#14:1:A>
And I must say <,> that all have been impressed <,> with the fresh  
view points <,> which he has been <,> presenting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#15:1:A>
Dr Dubashi has jokingly said that we should not <,> underestimate  
Goa <,> no sir we certainly do not do so <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#16:1:A>
We understand Goa <,> is a place where there is an integration of  
two cultures <,> where the temple of <indig> Mangeshi </indig> stands next to  
the old Cathedral of Goa <,> where the scenic beauty <,> provides <,> the  
very necessary background for the development of the cultures <,> and where  
you have got <,,> research institutes <,> of the stature of the <,> National  
Institute of Oceanography <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#17:1:A>
We know <,> therefore that Goa <,> is an education centre <,> Goa  
is a place which can really <,,> provide <,> something new in terms of  
knowledge something new in terms of developng <,> the human mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#18:1:A>
And <,> it is therefore <,> our beloved previlege sir <,> to share  
from your staff member as well as from ours <-> the </-> <,,> a different  
view point <,> on <,> culture a different view point on history and a  
different view point <,> on scientific achievements and the <,> ways <,>  
education should develop <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#19:1:A>
Dr Dubhashi had mentioned <,,> the <,> conference of vice-  
Chancellors <,> of <,> Commonwealth universities at Dehli which was held  
earlier this year <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#20:1:A>
One of the main problems <,> which was <,> discussed <,,> at this  
conference was that of <,,> mediocrity Vs excellence <,> and quantity Vs  
quality 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#21:1:A>
I am putting it the <,,> other way to what <,> the <,> westerners  
would put it <,> because today in India <,> in the education system at least  
we find that mediocrity <,> and quantity has held a sway <,> over quality and  
excellence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#22:1:A>
And what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the  
development of education in India is <,> that <,> excellence should be there  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#23:1:A>
If there is excellence <,> with quantity <w> I'll </w> be very <,>  
proud of it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#24:1:A>
But at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely  
essential before <,> we can really give <,> to the next generation what they  
deserve <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#25:1:A>
And from this point of view <,> the concept of academic staff  
colleges which the University Grants Commission has developed in recent years  
<-> was </-> is of great importance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#26:1:A>
It is unless we train our minds <,> unless we enlarge <,,> our own  
knowledge I do not think we can deliver to the students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#27:1:A>
What <,> Dr Dubhashi has again mentioned that the students <,,> has  
an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and  
outdated <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#28:1:A>
Many years ago I read in the <mention> <w> Readers' </w> Digest  
</mention> <,> a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has  
stuck to my mind <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#29:1:A>
In the scenario <-> was </-> two young children <,,> of about five  
or six <,> were playing in the school courtyard <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#30:1:A>
An <,,> aeroplane went over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#31:1:A>
One child said <,> <quote> It is a V H naming some uh <,> number of  
the aircraft </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#32:1:A>
The other said <quote> no no it is a V <,> uh nine look at the  
angle of the wings </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#33:1:A>
And then the <,> bell rang <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#34:1:A>
And then one child says to the another <,> <quote> Now <w> let's  
</w> go back and count those silly bits </quote> <,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#35:1:A>
So it is a fact from knowledge the <-> young </-> <,> younger  
generation know so much more <,> that <-> probably we </-> <,> probably we  
<,> who never had that training in our uh <,> younger days would not be able  
to transmit it 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#36:1:A>
And therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be  
taken <,> very very seriously <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#37:1:A>
As <,,> Dr Fernandes has pointed out the Academic Staff College has  
<,> three or four major objectives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#38:1:A>
These are <,> giving you the skill <,> for meeting the new  
challenges <,> making you aware of the linkages of education with society <,>  
making you <,> aware of the current trends in knowledge <,> making you aware  
<,> of the educational technology <,> and giving you a practical aspect <,>  
to what you are going to do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#39:1:A>
And I think all of these are very important <,> from the point <,>  
of view of a <,> teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#40:1:A>
You will find <,> that the <,> new challenges which are being put  
<,> <}> <-> before </-> <=> before </=> </}> us will require absolutely new  
skills 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#41:1:A>
What <,> I as a student learned <,> would probably be next to  
useless 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#42:1:A>
I just cannot handle a computer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#43:1:A>
But <,> a school <}> <-> <.> ch ch </.> </-> <=> child </=> </}>  
today knows the basics of computers 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#44:1:A>
He can handle it 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#45:1:A>
And five years later unless <,> we all can handle the skill I don't  
think we will be able to <,> give anything in terms <,> of knowledge to our  
students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#46:1:A>
What is most important is having an awareness of the linkage  
between education and society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#47:1:A>
Many years ago we had the traditional system of education where <,>  
the teacher <,,> lived <,> in his ivory tower <,> he <,> dealt with different  
aspects of his subject <,> he gained knowledge <,> he distributed the  
knowledge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#48:1:A>
But it was all very abstract <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#49:1:A>
And what Sidney Smith said was very important <quote> the teacher  
<,,> had the right to do everything </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#50:1:A>
In a university system you had the right to be wrong <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#51:1:A>
That was the <,> uh expression there <,> that even if a teacher  
taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and  
the right to be the wrong was one of the <,> biggest previleges of a  
university <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#52:1:A>
Today the times have changed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#53:1:A>
The whole social system is financing your education <,> and  
therefore you have something to pay back to uh society <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#54:1:A>
And this is the <,> university society linkage which has got to be  
very important <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#55:1:A>
The third aspect is also of developing our knowledge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#56:1:A>
Today <,> we are in an age where you have to draw from every other  
subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#57:1:A>
And this <,> I don't think <,> can be done on the basis of what <,>  
uh we have learned <,> during our <w> bachelor's </w> programme or in our <w>  
master's </w> programme 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#58:1:A>
We have got to go <,> to the right and left <,> and we have got to  
draw <,> from every source which we had <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#59:1:A>
Uh later in this afternoon I will be <,,> telling you or <w> I'll  
</w> be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our  
science and technology has developed uh since <,> the days of freedom and  
what are the problems <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#60:1:A>
Now one of the basic problems which I will try to tell you is that  
our background has not been broad enough <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#61:1:A>
And it is from this point of view <,> just <,> like it is essential  
for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture <,> it is very  
necessary for the <,> uh uh student of social sciences to know what the  
scientific development is 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#62:1:A>
And it is from this point of view <,> that uh <,> we will <,> have  
to enlarge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#63:1:A>
Again <,> when we transmit our knowledge there are certain  
techniques and then there are certain skills <,> and there are certain  
limitations <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#64:1:A>
Very uh <,> jokingly I will tell you one thing that <,> uh when I  
<,> had something to do with the educational <.> mis uh me </.> <,> media  
research centre at Poona University they were developing cassettes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#65:1:A>
And at that time one thing was said that when <w> it's </w> only an  
audio cassette <-> one </-> only if there is a speaker <,> and there is  
nothing else to be seen <,> the cassette should not be more than fifteen  
minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student  
for more than that period <O> laughter </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#66:1:A>
In brief <,> a teacher <,> uh uh a speaker should be <,> not <,>  
should not dwelt too much on a <,> uh special topic <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#67:1:A>
Dr <,> Dubhashi has drawn our <,> attention to the fact that there  
is something wrong with our national spirit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#68:1:A>
We have come to a stage <,> where we have become very much  
dependent <,> upon other countries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#69:1:A>
I mean the present economic crisis <,> uh is a very good example  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#70:1:A>
And he has also pointed out that the idealism which Gandhiji and  
Nehruji had <,> the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the  
spirit with which <,,> they <,,> looked <,> at the future is quite different  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#71:1:A>
Twenty-five years ago or a little more than that <,> I was in the  
United States <-> I was studying uh </-> <,> I was doing my post doctor  
research at that time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#72:1:A>
And I came to know some of the American professors very intimately  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#73:1:A>
One of them <,> in the context of the foreign policies of India and  
Pakistan said <,> <quote> like Pakistan why do you not co-operate with us  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#74:1:A>
If India co-operates <-> the </-> America will <,> lay down the red  
carpet for your country </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#75:1:A>
At that time I told him very <}> <-> <.> prou </.> </-> <=> proudly  
</=> </}> <,> <quote> We have been <,,> under slavery for a long time we do  
not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our  
feet </quote> <,> <O> clapping </O> twenty-five years later <,> I think <,,>  
we have <,,> failed <,> we have asked them to lay down the red carpet <,> and  
we are now willing to walk on that red carpet <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#76:1:A>
I do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at  
which we are <,,> looking at our problems <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#77:1:A>
But I do hope <,> that <,,> we will <,,> not only change ourselves  
but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#78:1:A>
And for that if you want the younger generation to change <,> then  
<,> they should not <,> look down at us <,> they should look <,> up at us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#79:1:A>
And if they are to look <,> up at us <,> then I think the basic  
requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for  
the next <,> fifty <w> minutes' </w> or sixty <w> minutes' </w> lecture <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#80:1:A>
We know our subject thoroughly well <,> wer are able <,> to enthuse  
the student <,> we are able to draw from them <,> certain amount of  
information <,> and we are able to make them to interact with us in <,> the  
search for knowledge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#81:1:A>
This is the spirit <,,> behind the Academic Staff College <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#82:1:A>
All of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh <,>  
this course <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#83:1:A>
I am sure that during the next <,> three weeks you will be provided  
with a lot of information <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#84:1:A>
My only hope is that you will take this information <,> you will  
imbibe whatever is given to you <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#85:1:A>
You will see that mentally <,> what has come together <,> it is  
co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#86:1:A>
And this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts <,> are not  
confined to <,> us <,,> to our colleagues <,> but they go down to our  
students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#87:1:A>
It is our duty <,> and I think all of us here <,> realize this <,>  
and all of us are willing to do our job <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#88:1:A>
<-> I must </-> <,> before I conclude I must again <,> thank Dr  
Dubhashi for coming here I must thank <,> uh him <,> for allowing the  
Academic Staff College of Goa University to hold its orientation programme  
here 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#89:1:A>
And <,> I am sure that with the fare Dr Devasthali has put out for  
you the <-> next three years would be </-> <,> next three weeks would be <,>  
not only <,,> very invigorating <,> but <,,> will be a very happy <,>  
vacation or so called vacation period for you <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-026#90:1:A>
Thank you all <,,> <O> clapping </O> </I>
