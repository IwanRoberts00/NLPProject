<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#65:1>
Thank you very much for your letter of 8/7 which I
received only  
on 25/7. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#66:1>
I have received your telegram & letters regarding
keynote. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#67:1>
Date will be fixed in a day or two depending on the
convenience of  
the Ed. Minister. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#68:1>
I will immediately let you know. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#69:1>
We were away in Mangalore from July 13 to 23. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#70:1>
Hence, probably you did not get me on telephone. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#71:1>
There was a wedding in the family. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#72:1>
I am sorry to know that you were unable to go to
Sweden. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#73:1>
I do know that funding agencies do not want to extend
assistance to  
retired people. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#74:1>
That is the attitude also towards those who are going
to retire like  
me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#75:1>
USEFI has for the last five years has consistently
rejected all my  
applications for a short term grant.

Make it comprehensive for publication though while
presenting you may  
not take more than 30 minutes or so. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#80:1>
We will be publishing your lecture after it is
delivered. </p> 
 
<p>

I hope you are well now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#82:1>
Do take care of your health. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#83:1>
It is good to know that you are likely to move to
Pune. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#84:1>
While it is good that your son wants to buy a flat in
Pune, you may  
think of shifting to Mulund or Thane.

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#89:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri: 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#90:1>
As per telephonic discussion of Jan. 10, I am
enclosing herewith  
my original service book for the service rendered in Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar  
College, Mahad. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#91:1>
As I explained to you on the phone, my FRA
statement from Dr.  
Ambedkar college in quadruplicate has been forwarded to Jt.
Director, Pune  
Region for his countersignature by the principal on December
8, 1997. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#92:1>
These papers have been received by the office in Pune.


<ICE-IND:W1B-007#93:1>
However, when I approached them through the good
offices of Mr.  
Gogte, they wanted the service book in original before they
countersign it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#94:1>
They had then assured me that if I bring the service
book, they will  
give me the papers duly countersigned on the same day. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#95:1>
The countersigned FRA has to be submitted to the
Jt. Director,  
Bombay region before he forwards papers of my another request,
viz. To  
condone one day break between my service in the VPM school and
the Ambedkar  
college. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#96:1>
These papers, I will personally bring to Pune at a
later date. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#97:1>
Please get the counter signing work done through
Mr. Gogte. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#98:1>
Last time he was good enough to send his assistant,
one Mr. Shintre,  
to get the work done. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#99:1>
Once FRA is countersigned, please send the
countersigned papers,  
service book and the copy of Dr. Ambedkar college letter- all
together to me  
by the speed post. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-007#100:1>
With best wishes for a successful, happy and
healthy new year. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-007#101:1>
