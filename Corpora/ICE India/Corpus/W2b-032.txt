<ICE-IND:W2B-032#4:1>
<bold> For </bold> millennia humans have wondered about what lay
beneath their feet - - the mysterious underground.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#5:1>
The inside of the earth is far more complicated than it was realised
ever before.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#6:1>
The rise of seismology - - the science of earthquakes - - has led to a
greater understanding of the <w> earth's </w> structure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#7:1>
The familiar onion-layer picture, with an outer crust, a core at the
centre and a mantle in between, describes almost all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#8:1>
The little that is left, however, is astonishing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#9:1>
Prediction of an earthquake with complete accuracy is still a
novelty in the world of respectable science, though it has come a long way
from folklore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#10:1>
Until a few decades ago the mere idea of a scientific basis for
forecasting drew a laugh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#11:1>
As the developer of the Richter scale said, <quote> " Only fools,
charlatans, and liars predict earth-quakes." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#12:1>
The amateurs observe such things as peculiar animal behaviour shortly
before an earthquake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#13:1>
Horses, cows and pigs reportedly stampede for no apparent reason.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#14:1>
Chickens and geese fly around dazedly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#15:1>
Dogs bark <O> photograph over coumn one and two </O> <O> caption </O>
unseeingly, and snakes slither out of their holes in winter and freeze.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#16:1>
Folklore related such animal behaviour to the coming of an
earthquake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#17:1>
But nobody knows whether it really is true. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#18:1>
The evidence that animals sense coming earthquakes is less than
conclusive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#19:1>
Now, it may be that water level changes earlier than the quakes have
driven snakes and rats out of their holes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#20:1>
Since electromagnetic radiation can be sensed by some animals and
even people and if there are big electromagnetic frequency changes before
quakes, it will reopen the question of animal behaviour before earthquakes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#21:1>
Earthquakes stem primarily from heavings and groanings of the <w>
earth's </w> crust.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#22:1>
They are one expression of mechanism called plate-tectonics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#23:1>
Growing knowledge of plate-tectonics in the 1970s gave some rationale
to the sudden ruptures on the earth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#24:1>
Giant crustal plates bearing the continents are driven by the
convection currents in the hot plastic mantle.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#25:1>
These plates grind past one another or spread apart at mid-ocean
ridges to allow hot magma to well up from below.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#26:1>
Stress builds up as a result of the sliding plates and finds sudden
release along pre-existing fracture lines called faults.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#27:1>
Thus earthquakes happen where the plates collide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#28:1>
Geologists believe that it is the upper 20 kilometres, in the
cold brittle part of the <w> earth's </w> crust, where earthquakes occur.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#29:1>
Below that, it is so hot there cannot be the sudden slip that
causes quakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#30:1>
It is probably more like hot taffy and the movement goes on all the
time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#31:1>
They don't know how the brittle surface faults are connected to what
is going on down below.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#32:1>
Is it pushing or pulling or is there a complex interaction ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#33:1>
But had there been pictures of quakes over the last few thousand
years, the answer would have been available. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#34:1>
When an earthquake is strong enough, say 4.5 on the Richter
scale, it will generate shockwaves so intense that they can jiggle the
recording pens of seismometers at points far distant from the origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#35:1>
And because these waves will have been diverted from a straight path
through reflection and / or refraction, they can serve geophysicists at
probes of the <w> earth's </w> inner structure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#36:1>
Some of the enormous energy generated by even minor quakes
travels outward from the point of origin in the form of waves, which are
basically of two types.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#37:1>
One is the pressure wave.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#38:1>
This is essentially a sound wave, consisting of a series of
compressions and relaxations propagated along the line of travel - -
longitudinally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#39:1>
The speed of these waves depends on the density of the material
through which they travel - - the denser, the faster.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#40:1>
Sound travels faster through water than through air, and even faster
through a solid-metal railroad track.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#41:1>
And they can be reflected or refracted when they encounter a
discontinuityan interface between materials of different density. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#42:1>
The second kind of a wave launched by an earthquake is a shear
wave.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#43:1>
Shear waves jiggle from side to side, perpendicular to the
direction of travel.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#44:1>
They can propagate through solids only, not liquids or gases.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#45:1>
And they travel at only two-thirds the speed of the pressure waves,
so they arrive at a given point later than pressure waves. </p> <O> <&> page

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#46:1>
Earthquake depths are less accessible than the moons of Jupiter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#47:1>
With action taking place 10 to 12 kilometres down, the strain signals
are hard to measure because they decay quickly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#48:1>
Even for large events, the surface manifestation is very small.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#49:1>
Quakes are the archetypal nonlinear process.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#50:1>
The earth takes hundreds of years storing vast amounts of energy and
gives it all back in seconds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#51:1>
Imperfect foresight has profound implications for millions of
people who live along <w> earth's </w> zones of potential seismic activity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#52:1>
Around the world, quakes on an average kill 10,000 to 15, 000 people
a year and destroy 7 billion worth of property.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#53:1>
The number of deaths varies widely.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#54:1>
In 1976, as many as 700,000 may have died, most of them in a single
quake in China that was not predicted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#55:1>
While scientists are using their instruments to create a
contemporary record, they are also striving to maintain and extend the
historical record.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#56:1>
Knowing when earthquakes have occurred over long periods of time
affords them a pattern from which they can make assumptions of a reasonable
<quote> ` repeat time' </quote> between two earthquakes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#57:1>
Today, researchers all over the world are trying to refine their
still shaky art of prediction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#58:1>
In China, an army of 10,000 scientists and a network of 100,000
amateur observers are engaged in earthquake research.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#59:1>
Even though experts are still not able to warn people in time,
research has been encouraging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#60:1>
Geophysicists use tillimeters and gravimeters to study possible
tectonic activity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#61:1>
Electronic instruments measure changes in the local magnetic field
and in the electrical conductivity of the rocks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#62:1>
Radon gas measurements in well water are taken to detect expansion.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#63:1>
One area of research is the plotting of sequences of seismic
activity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#64:1>
Time and activity patterns, the precise pinpointing of quake-prone
areas, and the factors that precede and follow quake occurrences are all
parts of prediction effort.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#65:1>
Seismic tomography is being increasingly used to recreate the <w>
earth's </w> images, thus uncovering from crust down to the core-features
that range from the unexpected to the earthshaking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#66:1>
According to a US seismologist, Allan Lindh, <quote> " The
starting point is to divide the amount the earth moved in the last quake by
the slip rate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#67:1>
That is very approximate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#68:1>
You can only expect to get within about ten per cent of the
recurrence time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#69:1>
Ground movements can be measured by satellites and lasers to find how
fast the plates are moving, but we only have a vague idea what the critical
point for rupture is." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#70:1>
Researchers are trying to find out how the long-term strain
accumulation and release cycles work, interact, and when they will next reach
the failure point.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#71:1>
A new forecasting method is being tested in Northern Turkey under the
Turkish-German Earthquake Research Programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#72:1>
The method is based on recording and studying of microquakes along a
fault line, which makes it possible to forecast larger earthquakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#73:1>
It was observed that a number of microquakes increased noticeably
before a major earthquake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#74:1>
This method is not applicable universally because the respective
local geological conditions vary a great deal, which makes an enormous
difference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#75:1>
The changes in the distances between the fixed points of
reference, on the <w> earth's </w> surface also provide important
information.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#76:1>
Within the framework of the Turkish-German Earthquake Research
Programme, the exact distances between fixed points up to 10 kilometres
apart, preferably on mountains, are ascertained with the help of laser beams.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#77:1>
Shifts of less than five millimetres in the ground plates can thus be
recorded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#78:1>
On a global scale, satellite geodetics surveying can detect the
movements of entire continents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#79:1>
A laser beam is relayed to the satellite <quote> " Lageos" </quote>
from the corresponding observation station on the <w> earth's </w> surface.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#80:1>
This satellite, equipped on all sides with laser mirrors, reflects
the incoming light, which is then picked up again by the measurement
stations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#81:1>
The exact distance to the satellite can be calculated on the basis
of the transmission time of the light signals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#82:1>
If this experiment is carried out from various continents the
distance between the continents can be determined with a degree of
precision of up to 10 centimetres through geometrical calculations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#83:1>
Changes in this distance, however, can be recorded with an
accuracy of up to one centimetre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#84:1>
Researchers have also discovered that Europe and North America are
drifting apart at a speed of two centimetres while Asia and America are
moving towards each other at a speed of up to 16 centimetres per year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#85:1>
These findings, however, do not allow deductions to be made with
regard to locally imminent earthquakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#86:1>
The existing network of corresponding observation stations is not
yet extensive enough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#87:1>
However, if a tighter network was set up, especially in regions with
a high earthquake risk, many an earthquake could probably be predicted in
advance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#88:1>
The concept of the <quote> ` seismic gap' </quote> has also
proved its worth when forecasting the location of an earthquake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#89:1>
The seismic gap refers to the area of a high-risk earthquake
region, in which there have been hardly any earthquakes for a longer
period.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#90:1>
Seismic tension has been reduced in the <w> gap's </w> surroundings
through previous earthquakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#91:1>
There is an increased probability in the seismic gap, however, that
the corresponding plates are under tension and that this might be relieved by
a major quake. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#92:1>
A major problem in forecasting an earthquake is due to anomalies
of one or the other of these parameters as a result of which published prior
warnings did not come true.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#93:1>
This diminishes confidence in the forecasts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#94:1>
In an actual earthquake situation the warning might be ignored. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#95:1>
What is more, incorrect forecasts can lead to economic losses for
a certain region.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#96:1>
For example, tourists may decide not to travel, real estate prices
may fall or important investments not made.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#97:1>
To ensure that earthquake forecasting is not carried out on a purely
phenomenological basis, a theory is required that is able to describe what
occurs in the <w> earth's </w> mantle prior to an earthquake. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#98:1>
For predicting an earthquake one has to know how fast the plates
are moving and how much plate divergence leads to a quake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#99:1>
But even with adequate earthquake history and good measurements,
the result it still approximate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-032#100:1>
Investigators know that earthquakes are bound to happen where
the plates collide.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#101:1>
What they don't know and are determined to find out is where a great
quake will happen first, and whenwith an exactitude fitting in with their
generalised, long-term forecasts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-032#102:1>
In short, what they will be able to formulate is early prediction
as reliable and routine as weather forecasting. </p> <*> filled square </*>
