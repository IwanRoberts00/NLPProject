<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#4:1>
<quote> ` <bold> <smallcaps> JUNGLE </smallcaps> </bold> ' </quote> is
a rather unimaginative name for a world, but those who have been there
insist that no other name would do, for the planet was just that - - one vast
continuous tropicaloid forest, and nothing else. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#5:1>
Far off the space lanes, in a forgotten sector of the Galaxy,
Jungle was just another Earth-like world, too remote to be worth colonizing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#6:1>
It would have remained so, one of a myriad anonymous green dots
spattered on the official wall map of the Galaxy, had not some imbecilic
planner from Mining and Supply reached up as high as he could and said,
<quote> " We need a fuel depot far out, say, here." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#7:1>
Here, of course, being Jungle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#8:1>
Jungle was hardly the place to spend <w> one's </w> vacation, but
when Krishneider invited me over, I jumped at the opportunity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#9:1>
He was pump engineer on Jungle, home on leave, and due to return the
next day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#10:1>
He had dropped in to say goodbye.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#11:1>
A snowstorm was raging outside when he told us about Jungle, and, in
the crackling mellow glow of the ion fireplace, it seemed to me a world of
fantasy and adventure waiting to be <O> Illustrations : Vidya </O> explored.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#12:1>
The discomforts and inconveniences he described only added to its
allure, and when he jokingly suggested I go and see for myself, I was
thrilled and immediately agreed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#13:1>
We hitched a ride on the supply tanker.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#14:1>
It took two days to get there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#15:1>
I have travelled in space before, but not on anything as
uncomfortably utilitarian as a cargo vessel, and was relieved when we
transferred to the landing pod.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#16:1>
This shuttle-craft had view windows and, as we drew away from the
tanker, I could see its drab grey hull with the hosepipe trailing down into
the cloud cover of the planet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#17:1>
Soon we descended into the clouds and all was grey until suddenly the
<w> planet's </w> surface was revealed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#18:1>
As far as the eye could see, the planet was covered entirely with
one continuous, unrelieved carpet of green vegetation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#19:1>
There seemed to be no bare spots except, of course, for the
rectangular clearing towards which we were headed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#20:1>
At one end of the landing field were prefab huts, while at the other
were the fuel bowsers and the storage tanks from which the <w> tanker's </w>
hosepipe snaked upwards into the clouds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#21:1>
I have been on other terroid and terraformed worlds before, but
nothing had prepared me for the scalding blast of hot, steamy air that
engulfed me as I walked out into the <w> planet's </w> atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#22:1>
I gasped, feeling suffocated and nauseated as Krishneider hurried me
across the field into the huts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#23:1>
As I greedily gulped lungfulls of the cool dry air inside, he
laughed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#24:1>
<quote> " <w> You'll </w> get used to it in a few minutes, don't
worry," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#25:1>
<quote> " But first, a wash and a meal." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#26:1>
The other three men stationed on Jungle had been out filling the
fuel tanks, and as we sat down to eat, they trooped in.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#27:1>
They were, I noticed, beaded with sweat and their clothes were
patchily wet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#28:1>
After brief introductions all around, they excused themselves for a
bath and a change. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#29:1>
When the men joined us a short while later, I had a good look at
them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#30:1>
They were all toughened veterans, men of the world, variations on a
theme.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#31:1>
They made polite conversation but I could see that they, each one of
them, were basically loners; taciturn and self-contained, congregating only
for meals and for work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#32:1>
<quote> " <w> You're </w> going to be bored here," </quote> the
man called Ramamoto said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#33:1>
<quote> " This fuel dump is just that, a dump." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#34:1>
The others smiled at what must have been a stock joke. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#35:1>
<quote> " <w> There's </w> nothing to see outside except the
depressingly same forest," </quote> the man called Davidyadhar said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#36:1>
<quote> " <w> You'll </w> tire of it in an hour.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#37:1>
<w> We've </w> got a well-stocked library, of course, but you didn't
come here to watch vids.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#38:1>
Sorry, but ours is a terribly uninteresting world." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#39:1>
<quote> " Don't believe them," </quote> the man called Inderson
said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#40:1>
<quote> " Go out and have a look for yourself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#41:1>
The air is no worse than, or as good as, that of the saunas on your
home planet." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#42:1>
He smiled and added, <quote> " If you like <w> I'll </w> take you
exploring some day" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#43:1>
<quote> " Just don't get lost," </quote> Krishneider warned.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#44:1>
<quote> " Go out whenever you like, but don't wander too far.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#45:1>
<w> There's </w> no need to, really.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#46:1>
Its all the same everywhere." </quote> </p> <O> photograph </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#47:1>
After lunch I went out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#48:1>
The blast was less intense, perhaps because I was expecting it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#49:1>
It did feel just as though I were entering a sauna and as I began to
sweat at the door of the hut I began to feel better.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#50:1>
The planet, I decided, could be tolerated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#51:1>
The sky was clouded over, grey and damp like a wiping rag.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#52:1>
There was no wind and it was searingly hot.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#53:1>
The air shimmered and steamed and I rained sweat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#54:1>
I walked to the edge of the landing field.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#55:1>
The forest seemed to be straining inwards, held back as it was by a
fence of barbed wire and a zone of soil impregnated with plant-toxin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#56:1>
There was a stepladder over the fence and I clambered across into the
forest.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#57:1>
Twenty paces inwards and the landing field was out of sight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#58:1>
I looked around.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#59:1>
The plants were typical of tropicaloid forests anywhere - -
broadleaves, treeferns, creepers, shrubby undergrowth and the all-pervading
smell of wet rot.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#60:1>
The ground was moist and the vegetation was shiny wet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#61:1>
It never rained here on Jungle, but everything dripped water with an
incessant, nerve-wracking drip-drip-drip.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#62:1>
There was no natural break in the forest cover, I had been told.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#63:1>
No clearings or glades, no pools of water, no rivers, no hills, no
valleys - - the tropicaloid forest blanketed the planet like a green fungus.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#64:1>
Days were never really bright, nights never dark.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#65:1>
There was no hint of the <w> Sun's </w> direction, no break in the
grey cloud-stratum, no shadows by day and no stars at night. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#66:1>
Unfortunately, the fuel depot too turned out to be as boringly
unchanging as the surrounding forest.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#67:1>
I had expected to see interstellar craft buzzing in and out and had
even brought along my <w> observer's </w> handbook.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#68:1>
The sole hour of maintenance chores each day seemed to be all the
activity here.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#69:1>
I asked Ramamoto about this lack of traffic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#70:1>
<quote> " No commercial transport comes this way," </quote> he
said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#71:1>
<quote> " <w> We're </w> in a sparsely populated sector near the <w>
Galaxy's </w> edge, you know.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#72:1>
No private craft can get here : we are more than a tankful away from
the nearest fuel depot, in any direction.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#73:1>
All we get is the occasional smuggler sneaking into the Galaxy
through the back door.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#74:1>
<w> That's </w> bureaucratic planning for you - - an expensively
maintained fuel dump of use to illegals only." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#75:1>
The men passed their time watching vids or reading.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#76:1>
I spent the first week getting thoroughly bored.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#77:1>
I went out along with the men on their daily chores but ventured
alone into the forest just twice.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#78:1>
Only Inderson seemed to have something to do.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#79:1>
He read a lot, he made notes, he painted, and he went for long
solitary walks at all odd hours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#80:1>
I also saw him often take a ray-gun from the rack and walk off
into the forest, whistling softly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#81:1>
Hours later, <w> he'd </w> show up at the door of the hut, dripping
wet, with mud-spattered boots and a strange light in his usually distant
eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#82:1>
Once, in response to my curious look, he grinned and said, <quote> "
Oh I just wander here and there." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#83:1>
Imagine my surprise then when, one day, he said to me suddenly,
<quote> " Grab a gun and come with me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#84:1>
<w> Let's </w> get to the heart of Jungle." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#85:1>
Our walks became a regular feature.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#86:1>
Inderson would walk ahead throughout the forest, apparently at
random, though he never lost his way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#87:1>
I dawdled behind, amazed that he could recognize anything in that
green leafy uniformity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#88:1>
Now and then, he would stop and point out some interesting feature.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#89:1>
Once, I brought along my notebook to jot things down but the constant
dripping from above smudged everything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#90:1>
I was therefore pressed to remember and gradually the intricate
ecology of the planet became apparent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#91:1>
Inderson showed me ingenious seed dispersal mechanisms, plants that
fought for living room by dripping soluble toxins from their leaves and
elaborate insect traps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#92:1>
<quote> " But <w> there's </w> no <foreign> fauna </foreign> on
Jungle," </quote> I said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#93:1>
<quote> " Oh there certainly is," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#94:1>
<quote> " No large animals, of course, or our scanners would have
detected them, but there are quite a few insectoids, a few bugoids and
gruboids, a <O> Continued on page 50 </O> <O> Continued from Page 32 </O>
lizardoid, some frogoids <*> dotted line</*> nothing very remarkable."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#95:1>
<quote> " How come I haven't seen any?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#96:1>
<quote> " <w> That's </w> because of the squelchy sounds you make
as you approach," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#97:1>
<quote> " Believe me, they are there, and if <w> you're </w> patient
and careful, <w> you'll </w> be able to see them." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#98:1>
Then he added as an afterthought, <quote> " Otherwise why do you
think I carry this ray-gun around" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#99:1>
<quote> " But surely there aren't any dangerous species."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#100:1>
<quote> " <w> I'm </w> not worried about being attacked,"
</quote> he laughed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#101:1>
<quote> " You see, I do the hunting." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#102:1>
I kept silent awhile.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#103:1>
Hunting, I knew, was the killing of lower species by primitive man
for food, and later, as a sport.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#104:1>
I had even played a vid-game called <quote> ` Fox-Hunt' </quote> ,
but found it rather silly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#105:1>
<quote> " You mean <*> dotted line</*> you kill these creatures
<*> dotted line</*> for <*> dotted line</*> nothing?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#106:1>
I was aghast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#107:1>
<quote> " Of course not." </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#108:1>
<quote> " I merely exercise my skill in the use of the ray-gun:
hunting is a test of aim and dexterity and timing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#109:1>
Something like what you do when you massacre alien invaders on your
vid-game screens." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#110:1>
<quote> " But all that isn't real," </quote> I protested.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#111:1>
<quote> " Isn't it cruel to take life just for amusement.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#112:1>
As a pastime ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#113:1>
It doesn't seem right somehow." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#114:1>
<quote> " Ah, but <w> I'm </w> not intending any cruelty.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#115:1>
Just as the accidents and diseases that kill us humans have no
malicious intent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#116:1>
To the creatures I kill I am merely a misfortune, a disaster
ordained from above.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#117:1>
Something they can never know of, let alone predict or avoid."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#118:1>
I was sceptical.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#119:1>
<quote> " What great skill does it need to point a ray-gun and
depress a trigger?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#120:1>
<quote> " No, no.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#121:1>
You misunderstand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#122:1>
<w> I'm </w> not testing myself or my weapons against lowly
creatures.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#123:1>
<w> I'm </w> far above all that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#124:1>
I kill, you see," </quote> he said solemnly, <quote> " in order to
play God." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#125:1>
God.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#126:1>
The primal myth of an unknowable force up on high that was supposed
to reward good and punish sin, something to hold responsible for random
misfortune.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#127:1>
Today, the word survives only in cliches and expletives.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#128:1>
Was Inderson being serious, I wondered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#129:1>
He explained: <quote> " The only creature on Jungle large enough
to be worth killing is a lizardoid.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#130:1>
It preys on a bugoid which it kills by spitting an instantly acting
contact toxin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#131:1>
At that <O> sketch </O> very instant, I blast out the <w>
lizardoid's </w> brains.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#132:1>
I am the <w> predator's </w> nemesis, instantly wreaking a
mathematically precise retribution.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#133:1>
The lizardoid is killed as it kills, the moment it kills: in effect,
the killer kills itself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#134:1>
A prompt punishment tailored to fit the crime.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#135:1>
What God can be so just?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#136:1>
He laughed, but I knew he meant it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#137:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> all a game, of course," </quote> he said,
eyes twinkling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#138:1>
<quote> " <w> I'm </w> sure <w> you'd </w> like to try it." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#139:1>
He didn't seem to want an answer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#140:1>
The next day, after lunch, he reached for the gun rack and
called me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#141:1>
He shouldered a ray-gun and handed me one.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#142:1>
Had he asked me, I might have refused, but he seemed to take it for
granted that I wanted a go at his game.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#143:1>
With the decision having been made for me, I began to look forward
to this intriguing pastime of his. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#144:1>
The bugoid, he explained, lived on a jipweed and fed on its
axillary buds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#145:1>
A lizardoid intending to dine on the bugoid would approach
stealthily along the drainage grooves that ran down the jipweed branch to its
axil.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#146:1>
It moved in sudden short bursts of speed and then suddenly froze
when it was within spitting range.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#147:1>
It would then puff its cheeks and spit out the deadly gob of
poisonous froth that would kill the bugoid on contact.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#148:1>
It would then clamber down to dinner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#149:1>
The aim of the game was to render both the deaths of the
predator and its prey simultaneous.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#150:1>
Spitting distance, as judged by the lizardoid, varied considerably.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#151:1>
The puffing of its cheeks just prior to spitting was a cue, but a
variable amount of time had to be allowed for the frothy saliva to float
across what that particular lizardoid judged to be optimum spitting range.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#152:1>
Ensuring that the ray reached the lizardoid the instant its spit
reached the bugoid required split-second timing of an exquisite degree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#153:1>
<quote> " <w> You'll </w> know <w> you've </w> done it right
when you see the gob of spit smother the bugoid the moment you hear the <w>
lizardoid's </w> skull burst," </quote> Inderson said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#154:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> an indescribably exhilarating sense of
accomplishment, I tell you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#155:1>
A sport fit for Gods." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#156:1>
Inderson showed me how to approach a jipweed stealthily, using
sheets of paper as stepping stones to silence the noisy sticking squelches
the wet soil made underfoot.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#157:1>
He showed me how to move in slow-motion and how to breathe away, so
as to avoid setting up draughts that a bugoid could sense.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#158:1>
And indeed, the forest suddenly seemed to be crawling with life.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#159:1>
Three of five jipweeds I approached had brown crusty bugoids
chomping away at the axillary buds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#160:1>
It was a wonder I thought that the jipweed could grow at all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#161:1>
The slightest sound, even a breath midirected towards it, would send
the bugoid scuttling for its burrow down the jipweed stem.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#162:1>
The sixth jipweed I sneaked up to revealed a pimply, green lizardoid
stalking a bugoid.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#163:1>
I inched myself into position hardly daring to breathe.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#164:1>
The lizardoid advanced like a clockwork toy with a faulty ratchet
until it got, I felt, a bit too close.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#165:1>
The bugoid must have been very short-sighted, for it chomped on,
unsuspecting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#166:1>
Kneeling, I sighted the ray-gun down the branch.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#167:1>
I lost sight of all else, caught up as I was in the thrill of the
hunt.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#168:1>
My world shrank to the gunsight and the <w> lizardoid's </w> occiput
on which it was trained.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#169:1>
I was sure the next move would be a spit.

The bugoid was so close that the time lag would be negligible and,
just possibly, <w> I'd </w> be able to coincide both deaths exactly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#171:1>
I was possessed by the spirit of the game.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#172:1>
Kill I willed the lizardoid; kill and be killed !

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#173:1>
I held life in the crook of my finger.

<ICE-IND:W2F-004#174:1>
I was the God of the world on the jipweed, poised to hurl down the
ultimate punishment for the ultimate crime, at the moment of commission <*>
dotted line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#175:1>
The <w> lizardoid's </w> cheeks puffed out but, unaccountably,
instead of squeezing the trigger, I looked back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#176:1>
Just in time to see <w> Inderson's </w> ray-gun aimed at the
lizardoid, through my head. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-004#177:1>
And just in time to see a bolt of lightning lance down through
the caopy of leaves above towards <w> Inderson's </w> head. </p> <O> logo
