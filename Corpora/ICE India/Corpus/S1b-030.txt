<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#1:1:A>
So <}> <-> the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> movement <,,> in the
new situation <,> has to concentrate or adjust itself <,> to many of this <,>
uh issues or problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#2:1:B>
Quite right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#3:1:B>
Rasgotraji <,,> one uh issue I would like to raise which is <,> that
as a concept <,> non-alignment is perhaps <,> uh forty years old <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#4:1:B>
If you <}> <-> takes </-> <+> take </+> </}> its birth <,> with the
famous speech of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#5:1:A>
Nineteen forty-six

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#6:1:B>
Nineteen forty-six <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#7:1:B>
But as a movement it is <,> uh <-> thirty </-> thirty-one years old
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#8:1:B>
Now <,,> despite the fact that uh <,,> it has had criticism from all
quarters that you are mentioning <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#9:1:B>
There were critics even during the <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#10:1:B>
Would you say that in the present situation the concept is still
valid ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#11:1:B>
That uh <,,> that is number one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#12:1:B>
Number two has the non-align movement <,> if it opens a <,,>
balance of say <,> performance or achievement and I think <,> do you think
the ledger uh <,> shows more credit <,> or discredits <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#13:1:B>
Has it you got anything to be satisfied about <,,> in terms of the
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#14:1:B>
Has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some
elements of those agenda <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#15:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> take the concept first <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#16:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#17:1:A>
I think the foreign policy uh <,,> the whole idea of <,>
country having foreign policies <,> have been evolving <,,> four thousand
years let us say for a long time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#18:1:A>
Originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the <,> uh
framing of foreign policy and its <O> one word </O> <,> was the doctrine of
the supremacy of power <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#19:1:A>
Take up your neighbour <,> and the next <,> and the next <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#20:1:A>
So you are a dominant power

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#21:1:B>
Might is right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#22:1:A>
Then <,> came a more uh <,> rational concept in a world <,>
which had many more state impending on one another <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#23:1:A>
And this concept grew in the Italian city-states <,,> of the
medieval age <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#24:1:A>
Uh the back concept is balance of power

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#25:1:A>
But basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#26:1:A>
Now in nineteen forty-seven with the Independance of India a whole
new world emerged <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#27:1:A>
And in the fiftees and the sixtees <,> some <,> hundred new
countries joined the global panorama <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#28:1:A>
And this <,> called for <,> the <,> definition <,> of a new concept
<,> of our foreign policy <,> and the conduct of foreign policies in the
country

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#29:1:A>
That is <w> India's </w> contribution <,> uh to <,> the <,> the
evolution of the concept <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#30:1:A>
Now this I think is a very permanent sort of contribution <,,> to
the whole idea what a foreign policy is ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#31:1:A>
How it should be conducted ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#32:1:A>
And so on and so forth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#33:1:A>
Therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant
<,> for a very very very long time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#34:1:A>
Those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#35:1:A>
The idea is to make them irrelevent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#36:1:A>
What is non-aligned uh <,> concept basically <,> they forget the
name <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#37:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a policy of peace <,> independance co-operation among
nations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#38:1:A>
I think these three concepts are <?> redundant </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#39:1:A>
Now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#40:1:A>
To come to the second point uhm about the <,> uh record or the
ledger of this movement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#41:1:A>
Look at the initial agenda <,,> uh of the movement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#42:1:A>
It was decolonization <,,> uh disarmament <,,> uh <,,> the
disbandment <,> of apartheid <,> racialism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#43:1:A>
All those <,> most of those items have been acomplished

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#44:1:A>
And I think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example
<,> in dismantling of apartheid <,> even in <,> generating pressure for the
<,> beginning of <-> disarmament </-> nuclear disarmament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#45:1:A>
Non-alignment <,> non-aligned movement has played a very very
significant role <,> which will be part of human history <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#46:1:A>
Now times have changed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#47:1:A>
Mind you times have changed in a very limited sense

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#48:1:A>
I think <w> it's </w> wrong to take that there are no alliances

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#49:1:A>
Today NATO still exists <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#50:1:A>
<w> It's </w> in search of a new role <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#51:1:A>
What happened in the Gulf recently <,> is a good indicator <,> uh
for us to bear in mind <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#52:1:A>
And <,> <w> it's </w> the role of the non-align movement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#53:1:A>
While the last <,> Alliance Block persist <,> to oppose the concept
of law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#54:1:A>
It is not uh <,> the role of newly independent country <,> uh to
become a camp follower <,> of <,> one Block because one Block remains <,> and
the other has disappeared <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#55:1:A>
And certainly for India <,> <w> that's </w> not the role I
visualised <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#56:1:B>
Well uh <,> whatever scepticism about the movement <,> is
there <,> it is mostly in non-official <,> uh sources or quarters <,> because
governments which are subscribed to non-aligned <,,> concept and <,> <O> one
word </O> and movement are still committed to it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#57:1:B>
And this perhaps explains one reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#58:1:B>
The reason why <,> those movement started with only twenty-five
members <,> in Belgrade <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#59:1:B>
It is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members
and more and more <{> <[> are at </[> least want to come in either as guests
or as obeservers <,> or something

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#60:1:B>
So Mani there must be something in the movement <,,> to attract
them <,> A

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#61:1:B>
And B <,> they would also <,,> perhaps want to find out and assert
<,> what non-align movement is going to do ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#62:1:B>
In which area is it is it going to operate ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#63:1:B>
Because <,> the areas of uh <,> imperialism <,> anti-imperialsim
<,> anti-colonialism <,> anti-racism <,> all that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#64:1:B>
Theatre <,> is no more a <?> rationing </?> exhausted into it

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#65:1:B>
In what is a new theatre in which <,> non-align movement can
operate

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#66:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#67:1:C>
Viswam scepticism <,> <{> <[> yes <,> is largely spoiled by
ignorance <,> and by destructiveness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#68:1:C>
And when you say <,> use that rather <,> gentle word non-official
<,> we know that <w> it's </w> mostly people who have not spent <,> time
understanding the main spirits <,> of not only Indian Foreign Policy but the
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#69:1:C>
Who would wonder whether <,> non-alignment merely is a simplistic
equation with not being involved <,> in a world which is being divided up <,>
into rival military camps <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#70:1:C>
When you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#71:1:C>
I would prefer to take Mr <w> Rasgotra's </w> phrase <,> and think
what is the role of non-alignment in the new <,> international context rather
than <,> seek a new role for non-align movement

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#72:1:C>
Because <,,> the fundamental battle of non-align movement is
against the quest for dominance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#73:1:C>
We shall <?> alienate </?> international relation <,> for almost
all of human history <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#74:1:C>
The only reason <w> I'm </w> not able to say <,> for all the human
history is that ever since Jawaharlal Nehru <,> became a major player on the
international field <,> and brought to <?> bear </?> on international
relation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#75:1:C>
The better values that has been evolved by Mahatma Gandhi <,> in
the freedom movement <,> there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board
of international politics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#76:1:C>
That new chess board being <,> that in the new <,> uh concept being
<,> that instead of the <,> quest for dominance <,> could there be <,> a
quest for co-operation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#77:1:C>
Is it possible for countries which are <}> <-> <.> uneq </.> </->
<=> unequal </=> </}> <,> in their economic political or military endowments
<,> to have a relationship of equality between themselves <,> where we strive
to attain a <O> one word </O> optimum

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#78:1:C>
A <O> one word </O> optimum being one <,> where <,> neither <,>
that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium
and everyone <,> is better off by being attract particular point

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#79:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#80:1:B>
Well in other words <{> <[> I mean <}> <-> what </-> <=> what
</=> </}> <w> you're </w> saying is </[> inequality <,> inequality still
persist <,> and <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> in order to remove those inequality

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#81:1:C>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#82:1:C>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#83:1:C>
<w> That's </w> right <w> that's </w> what I <{> <[> <O> one
or two words </O> <,> I want to <?> revert </?> if I may just for a second to
what I opened with <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#84:1:C>
So long as inequality persists <,> non-alignment is required

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#85:1:C>
So long as oppression is there <,> non-alignment is required

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#86:1:C>
And so long as equal respect <,> is not accorded <,> that the
sovereignity of every single nation <,> that long will non-alignment

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#87:1:B>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#88:1:B>
<{> <[> Yes </[> Professor Mishra

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#89:1:D>
<[> Right right </[> </{> I was saying that uh <,> one of the
main reasons for misunderstanding <,,> in so far as the role and relevence of
non-alignment is concerned <,,> has occured <,> because the <,,> uh so called
soft power <,,> is in the hands of the industrialized countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#90:1:D>
Journals books universities research institutions and so on

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#91:1:D>
And <,> connected with this is the instrument of mass media <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#92:1:D>
Newspapers television this that and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#93:1:D>
This <,,> total situation has in a sense brainwashed <,,> uh elites
in many countries <,> and it is reflected in some of our newspaper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#94:1:D>
Some of these <,> uh people are writing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#95:1:D>
These are the people who have no <,,> appreciation <,> of our hopes
and aspirations <,> for our needs and requirements <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#96:1:D>
Therefore <}> <-> you </-> <,> <=> we </=> </}> come across <,>
including newspapers in India some of the national newspapers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#97:1:D>
Papers <,> there they are writing <,> articles on non-alignment <,>
which <,> which are absolutely out of phase <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#98:1:D>
Now this is one thing about uh <,> I mean the the mass media and
the so called soft power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#99:1:D>
The other thing which we must keep in mind is that when Jawaharlal
Nehru <,> pioneered this movement he was the real pioneer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#100:1:D>
He had two things in mind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#101:1:D>
One was that this country was economically poor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#102:1:D>
Politically <,> of not much consequence except that the leadership
was trying to <?> fail </?> on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#103:1:D>
And at the same time the international situation was very <O> one
word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#104:1:D>
In fact the the clouds of the third world war <,> uh on our
horizon <,> on the international horizon at that time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#105:1:D>
He tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order <,,> to
subserve <,> national interest of India <,> in an international atmosphere of
peace and harmony <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#106:1:D>
So in his view <,> the total picture of <,> of the <O> one word
</O> was there in which <,> the two systems <,> national and international
<,> were not antagonistic with each other

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#107:1:D>
But they were to function in harmony with each other

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#108:1:B>
Quite right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#109:1:B>
Mr Rasgotra you want want <{> <[> to say </[> something <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#110:1:A>
<[> May I </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#111:1:A>
I just want to <O> one word </O> this kind of scepticism <,,>
I find much more evident here in our own country than I found it for example
in Europe

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#112:1:A>
I was there uh last month <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#113:1:A>
I travelled around <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#114:1:A>
Uh in countries like Germany and France <,,> there is a strong
feeling <,> that this movement needs to be strengthened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#115:1:A>
As if <,> <O> one word </O> all kinds of new pressures <,> uh are
coming up

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#116:1:A>
There are new divisions arising

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#117:1:A>
Among the developed world also <,> there is uh new <,> uh scramble
for markets <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#118:1:A>
Uh economic pressures and other things

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#119:1:A>
Now <,,> this movement has a role in these circumstances <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#120:1:A>
In Europe I found great sympathy <,> with objectives of this
movement its way of conducting itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#121:1:A>
And I think that should <,> we we need to <,> uh rethink <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#122:1:A>
We should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a
thing between two other things <,> Russia <,> Soviet Union <,> United States
of America <,> Communism or Democracy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#123:1:A>
But as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a
positive concept

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#124:1:A>
Then this kind of <,> scepticism misunderstanding will not arise
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#125:1:B>
Mr <{> <[> Rasgotra </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#126:1:A>
<{> <[> One or two words </O> </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#127:1:D>
Here is in if you permit me I will just say one sentence

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#128:1:B>
Yes

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#129:1:D>
That <w> it's </w> a very <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#130:1:D>
On account of cereberal deficiency <,,> and moral timidity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#131:1:D>
I say moral timidity because <,> we are poor or by the <,> by a
certain power <,> which has reversed most predominant <,> and we are all very
uh <,> this <indig> mantra </indig> of uni polarism <,> is unnecessarily
amongst us

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#132:1:B>
Quite right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#133:1:A>
Try to <,> stress that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#134:1:B>
Non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#135:1:B>
And <,> the reason why <,,> the perception that Mr Rasgotra have
visited Europe <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#136:1:B>
Of people in Europe thinking <,> <w> we're </w> all relevent
adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking <,> that <w> we're
</w> perhaps less relevent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#137:1:B>
Is that there is a type <O> one word </O> <,> between the
polarities of the global politics <,> and the polarities of the global
economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#138:1:B>
In the global economy there are only two <,> really resurgent
players <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#139:1:B>
There is Germany <,> and <{> <[> Japan </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#140:1:A>
<[> Japan </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#141:1:B>
Neither of them has a role in the global polity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#142:1:B>
And the global polity <,> is now dominated by one power <,> which
is in the mist of the worst recession <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#143:1:B>
This is as experienced in

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#144:1:C>
Domestically right

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#145:1:C>
<O> A few words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#146:1:B>
And therefore everyone is searching for a new role

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#147:1:B>
And at that point in time <,> everyone is looking for a new role
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#148:1:B>
Specially those who used to be the dominant power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#149:1:B>
For us to say <,> that there is now no role for us in the new <,>
uh situation would be the biggest <,> mistake we could do

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#150:1:C>
No I have we not heard about <w> India's </w> role <{> <[>
<O> a few words </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#151:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#152:1:D>
Viswam I want to refined uh <,> with <w> Mani's </w>
permission his phrase a little

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#153:1:D>
He said <quote> alternative <,> moral force </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#154:1:D>
I think uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#155:1:C>
Moral force or no moral force

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#156:1:C>
Obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get
together <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-030#157:1:D>
I think <w> it's </w> a an alternative vision of the world
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#158:1:D>
Not a world of power <,> but a world of justice <,> peace <,>
co-operation <,> equality among nations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#159:1:D>
So that <,> everybody goes together <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-030#160:1:D>
But the vision <,> vision of one world <,> and one world can come
about only <,> not on the <,> basis of power <,> but justice fair-play
equality peace <,> co-operation
