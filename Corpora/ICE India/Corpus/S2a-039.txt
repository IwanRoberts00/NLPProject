<ICE-IND:S2A-039#1:1:A>
<w> I've </w> also wanted to enlist you <,,> uh another very  
important <,,> writer <,> Margaret <,,> Atwood <,,> Margaret Atwood and  
Robinson they each together <,,> are <,,> very much nationalists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#2:1:A>
Nationalist in the sense <,,> that they have <,,> raised their voice  
<,,> against the <,> imperialistic dominition of their country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#3:1:A>
The situation is something like this <,> <O> cough </O> on the one  
hand there is the imperial <,> Britain <,,> from which they have not been  
able to see the <O> a few words </O> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#4:1:A>
So the Britain <,,> is the exploiting power <,,> the conventional  
<,> relationship with Britain <,> on the one hand <,,> and <,,> America on  
the other side <,,> because across the border is America <,,> which is as  
well <,,> capitalistic exploitative <,,> society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#5:1:A>
If they don't <,,> uh <,,> bow <,,> or <,,> if they don't release  
them <,,> or if they resist <,,> the <,,> influence of the neighbour <,,>  
then this is a very difficult situation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#6:1:A>
Resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody <,>  
at a distance <,,> because <-> you can't </-> you have to come <,,> into  
contact daily <-> contact </-> with the neighbour <,> with whom you have to  
workout a relatioship in which <,,> there will be co-operation <,> and wanted  
or unwanted help <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#7:1:A>
You can't escape the influence of neighbour <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#8:1:A>
And the neighbour is another evil <,> which wants to dominate <,> as  
we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas  
at the beginning which <,,> brought out uh two nation of Canada and America  
<,,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#9:1:A>
So America <,> wants to exploit Canada <,> capitalistically <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#10:1:A>
And there is another type of relationship with Britain <,,>  
parental relationship <,> that too is very painful <,,> to receive at <,>  
what has Canada to do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#11:1:A>
Where is the choice <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#12:1:A>
Either you say <,> <quote> good bye <,,> to your parentage <,,> or  
you say good bye to your neighbour <,,> or you allow yourself <,,> to be  
doubly <,> exploited </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#13:1:A>
Both of them are exploitative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#14:1:A>
This is the worry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#15:1:A>
And Margaret Atwood <,> has raised her voice <,> particularly <,,>  
against <,,> <-> the </-> what is called <,,> the fashion of <,> <w> Women's  
</w> Liberation Movement that swept <,,> the whole of Europe <,> some decades  
back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#16:1:A>
We saw to liberate <,> the western women <,,> Margaret Atwood says  
<,> through her fiction <,,> that it is not feasible <,> it is not possible  
<,> it is another way of <,,> uh self detention <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#17:1:A>
The books <,,> which she has prominently <,,> written <,,> which  
are which have made her prominent <,> are <,> <mention> The <?> Adable </?>  
Women </mention> <,,> and <mention> Surfacing </mention> <,,> both the books  
<,,> deal with this problem of <,,> influence <,,> of the neighbour <,> and  
of them <,> of you know <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#18:1:A>
The west <,> uh the the <w> women's </w> liberation movement <,> is  
<,> <w> Europe's </w> <,> gift <,,> in which <,,> the women doesn't know what  
exactly she should do <,> in order to be called a <,,> liberated women <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#19:1:A>
So she is advised to <,> say <quote> Good bye to all the  
conventions <,,> all the conventional morality <,> like <,,> the institution  
of marriage </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#20:1:A>
Again <,,> about <,,> Amphly <,> and Clara <,> the two women <,,>  
characters in the <?> Adam and Who </?> <,> have been discussing this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#21:1:A>
Clara is a married person <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#22:1:A>
Joe <,> the husband <,,> of Clara <,,> is always impregnating her  
<,,> and then <,> every time there is a <,,> child <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#23:1:A>
And who nurses <,,> the child <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#24:1:A>
The mother only <,> gives the birth <,> the rest of the <,,> care  
is taken by father <,> feeding <,> washing <,> clothing <,> everything <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#25:1:A>
His <?> poses </?> according to our <,,> writer <,> Atwood is  
problem of <,> father image <,,> and the mother image <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#26:1:A>
What will the child <,,> think <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#27:1:A>
Who is the father <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#28:1:A>
The child will more likely answer <,,> a person <,> who feeds <,,>  
who cooks <,,> who washes <,,> is the father <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#29:1:A>
Who is the mother <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#30:1:A>
A person who sits <,> enjoys <,> sleeps <,> reads <,> writes is the  
mother <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#31:1:A>
There is a clash <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#32:1:A>
There is the projection of the clash <,> of values <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#33:1:A>
The value system <,,> will stand changed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#34:1:A>
And our <O> one word </O> <,,> goes a step further <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#35:1:A>
She says <,,> <quote> Why worry at all <,,> admitted <,,> that a  
<w> women's </w> life is made unfulfilled <,> until she has a child </quote>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#36:1:A>
That is the question of <,> women <,,> but that does not  
necessarily mean <,,> that she should marry <,,> where is the logic <,,>  
marriage is a social institution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#37:1:A>
It does not necessarily mean <,,> for someone to produce children  
<,> that he or she should marry someone <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#38:1:A>
You can have the children even outside the wedlock <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#39:1:A>
So you chose your man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#40:1:A>
You know <O> one word </O> him <,> a child is born <,,> good bye to  
the man <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#41:1:A>
The child will also mean <,> <w> I'm </w> the mother <,,> my  
fulfillness in my lap <,,> to hell with you man get away from you <,> that  
can be one solution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#42:1:A>
The problem will be <,,> the problem will be <,,> <O> laughter </O>  
how do you know <,,> who is the boy <,,> you see <,,> there is a real problem  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#43:1:A>
If you are <,,> a woman liberationist <,,> and if you are a woman  
<,> you want to break away from all of the convention <,> may be <,,> then  
you should actually prefer <,> to be the mother of a girl child <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#44:1:A>
This is what the logic is <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#45:1:A>
But no mother <,,> no mother has ever thought of <,,> a child  
inside the womb as <,> there for a girl every mother thinks of <,,> the child  
as he <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#46:1:A>
What is this he <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#47:1:A>
Why always he <,> even though you are claiming or shouting from the  
rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#48:1:A>
The same problem <,,> of slavery <w> man's </w> slavery <,> you  
have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention <,,> which  
accords greater status higher status to man <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#49:1:A>
So <,> even though you are a liberationist <,,> you are still  
thinking of your child about whom you don't know <,> as a he 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#50:1:A>
It means you are still pining for a male child <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#51:1:A>
This is a thought this is a very embarassing <,,> for <,> for all  
<,,> women <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#52:1:A>
So our uh uh puts up this question <,,> to which there is no answer  
except that <,> ultimately <,,> we arrive at a conclusion that marriage <,,>  
is a co-institution <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#53:1:A>
It solves many problems <,,> not only of the personality <,> of the  
feminist <,,> but even of cohesion <,,> of harmony <,> in the society <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#54:1:A>
And thereby she seems to reject <,> this wave of <w> women's </w>  
liberation <,> that has come from Europe 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#55:1:A>
The <,> parental <,> left <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#56:1:A>
In such a theme <,> she finds <,> <-> that </-> a terrible mistake  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#57:1:A>
There seems to be an American <,,> in the pristine forest <,,> she  
finds that Americans are <,> poaching <,,> Americans are there looking for  
<,,> the <,> wealth which they can exploit the natural wealth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#58:1:A>
So if they are <,> boating <,,> in the lake <,,> the American is  
always interested <,,> in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish  
<,,> which he can <,> perhaps later <,,> how to exploit it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#59:1:A>
In the forest <,,> pristine dense <,> green forest <,,> our <,>  
Margaret Atwood finds <,,> uh beautifully located <,> huts <,,> over which  
the Americans C I A agents have an eye and they want to have <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#60:1:A>
Such properties <,> where they can plant themselves <,> in order to  
espionage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#61:1:A>
So <,,> we can say <,,> that here is a writer a woman writer <,,>  
who has very much identified herself <,> with the problems and establishments  
of her country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#62:1:A>
She has identified <,> but she has not been able to find an answer  
<,> and this <,> inability of the writer to find an answer <,> to the complex  
problems of <,> <O> two words </O> full <,> and neighbourly <,> uh compulsion  
<,,> which has created a very ordinary event situation 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#63:1:A>
<w> It's </w> at the present <,> incidentally is the hallmark of  
women creative writing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#64:1:A>
And <,,> they are <?> uneducated </?> <,> they can't meet <,> seem  
to know what exactly they should do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#65:1:A>
So this type of situation <,,> has attracted <,> or marked the  
writing of <,,> the character <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#66:1:A>
Uh however there is an exception <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#67:1:A>
That too is a little <,,> along the line <,,> because we have so  
far discussed <,,> English speaking novelist <,> writers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#68:1:A>
Let us go to the French <,,> Canada <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#69:1:A>
And I have selected and talk <,> for a few minutes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#70:1:A>
<w> I've </w> selected <,,> to introduce you <,> a very prominent  
French <,> Canadian writer Premjeet Roy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#71:1:A>
Premjeet Roy <,> has written a novel <,,> uh <mention> Where <,,>  
the <w> hen's </w> will nest <,> Where the <w> hen's </w> will nest  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#72:1:A>
This is <,,> a novel about <,> a very very remote area <,>  
uninhabited <,> by <,,> the people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#73:1:A>
And there is only one family <,> after <,> traversing the land <,>  
crossing various streams and waters you reach a place <,> where there is only  
one family <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#74:1:A>
And that family is a French speaking catholic <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#75:1:A>
And this <,> Lousina <,,> the woman <,,> has a problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#76:1:A>
She has eight children <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#77:1:A>
She is an educated woman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#78:1:A>
She occasionaly visits <,,> uh centres <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#79:1:A>
Uh let me introduce you to which we can call <,> centres of  
civilization <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#80:1:A>
She keeps in touch with the <,> modern world in order to know that  
<,> the progress <,> or the new I mean uh <,> or the new things <,> that are  
happening <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#81:1:A>
Must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the  
<,,> of the latest <,> only because <,,> there is some problem <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#82:1:A>
Is it because of me <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#83:1:A>
Uh uh I hope <,,> these external things are not against me <,,> <O>  
laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#84:1:A>
Can we do something about it <,,> ? <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#85:1:A>
So she occasionally <,,> I don't mind if <,,> uh it doesn't work uh  
<&> interruption </&> but this will continue yes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#86:1:A>
So she goes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#87:1:A>
She has a problem <,,> of education <,> of her children 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#88:1:A>
She is living <,,> as a family unit in a remote <,> forest area  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#89:1:A>
And she is very much worried about the education of her children  
because <,,> the Canada government stipulates <,> <w> that's </w> in order to  
<,> sanction a school <,> there should be atleast six pupils <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#90:1:A>
She has five <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#91:1:A>
At present she has five <,> and one is too small <,,> to be  
admitted or enrolled <,> as a pupil <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#92:1:A>
But she nevertheless <,> writes to the government <,> and they  
mercifully appoint <,> a teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#93:1:A>
The first teacher <,,> is a Catholic <,,> woman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#94:1:A>
The moment she comes <,,> she endears herself <,,> mixes with the  
family <,,> becomes a member or part of the family <,> teaches very  
meticulously <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#95:1:A>
She is very punctual <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#96:1:A>
She wants <,> to take full interest <,,> without wasting a moment  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#97:1:A>
So one year passes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#98:1:A>
The education of these children for one year has taken place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#99:1:A>
There is a transfer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#100:1:A>
The next <,,> woman teacher <,,> is an English <,,> woman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#101:1:A>
And the moment she comes <,,> she finds <,> fault with everything  
that exist there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#102:1:A>
She starts complaining oh <,,> what a stretch I have had to travel  
<,> <w> I'm </w> tired and <w> I'm </w> bored <,> <w> I'm </w> as if <,,> in  
a <,,> in an undesirable situation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#103:1:A>
I feel very much <,,> unhappy here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#104:1:A>
And what are these people <,,> <w> Lousina's </w> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#105:1:A>
They have not provided <,,> a good accomodation to me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#106:1:A>
The food also is not <,,> palatable to me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#107:1:A>
The children are also very dirty 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#108:1:A>
They don't have good habits <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#109:1:A>
She starts complaining <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#110:1:A>
She complains and complains <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#111:1:A>
But she stays on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#112:1:A>
And <w> she's </w> looked after by Lousina <,,> as she did in the  
case of the earlier teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#113:1:A>
She was a French <,> here is an English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#114:1:A>
She does not give any chance <,> of complain to this woman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#115:1:A>
But this woman by nature is fussy <,> as we call such people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#116:1:A>
She is also transfered <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#117:1:A>
And when she is transfered she realises oh <,,> the place was <,>  
not so bad after all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#118:1:A>
I could have <,> stayed on 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#119:1:A>
Why have they transfered <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#120:1:A>
The two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#121:1:A>
And Lousina does not feel <,,> uh <,,> that she should complain  
against the teacher because she finds <,,> the great advantage <,> of an  
English speaking <,> teacher being made available to her children because  
otherwise <,,> her children would never have a chance to learn English <,,>  
particularly in the context <,,> of the modern world in which English has  
become a lingua franca <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#122:1:A>
If <,> her <.> childre </.> her children <,,> were given <,>  
education or instruction only in French <,,> they would <,> lose the  
advantages of <,,> the world wide <,,> uh <,,> contact <,,> spread of  
kmowledge <,,> etcetera etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#123:1:A>
So she <,,> feels that <w> it's </w> a very good event <,> that  
<,,> this <?> coach </?> <,,> as the British teacher have come <,> and <,,>  
she feels thankful to the <,> arrival of these two teachers 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#124:1:A>
However <,> the third teacher is a male <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#125:1:A>
He is a French <,,> male <,> a bachelor <,,> unmarried <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#126:1:A>
When he comes <,,> he doesn't take any interest in teaching  
children 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#127:1:A>
He says <,,> <quote> teaching will take place afterwards <,> don't  
worry 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#128:1:A>
Let me go to the nature <,,> let me enjoy I feel very happy 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#129:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> shoot <,,> <w> I'll </w> fish </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#130:1:A>
And he would retire to the jungle <,,> put a cap on his eyes <,>  
and sleep there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#131:1:A>
And he says <quote> education will take place <,,> <w> we'll </w>  
see <,,> to that part of duty later <,> let me enjoy </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#132:1:A>
He enjoys <,> he always <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#133:1:A>
He starts calling her mama <,> <quote> oh mama </quote> <,,>  
mother <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#134:1:A>
And <,,> he is interested in eating good things <,> always demands  
this and that does not feel shy <,,> or constraint <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#135:1:A>
And then he also receives <,,> the transfer orders <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#136:1:A>
He does not disclose it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#137:1:A>
But all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#138:1:A>
He becomes very serious <,,> in teaching <,,> these children <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#139:1:A>
And they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#140:1:A>
He teaches them wonderful things very advanced things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#141:1:A>
And before he goes <,,> he completes <,> what he calls his course  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#142:1:A>
So there is no complaint <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#143:1:A>
Lousina loves to have this man <,> as a teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#144:1:A>
She says <,,> <quote> Why don't you stay on </quote> <,,> ?

<quote> Write to the government <w> we'll </w> also write <,,>  
that your <,,> stay here should be extended </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#146:1:A>
The man says <quote> No <,,> thank you for all the hospitality and  
the care you took of me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#147:1:A>
But <,,> <w> I'm </w> going on promotion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#148:1:A>
And <w> I'm </w> going to a place where I would like to make my  
career <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#149:1:A>
This is not the place <,> where I can make my career <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#150:1:A>
So even though I love the place <,> I have enjoyed it but mum <,>  
I will not tie my career </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#151:1:A>
We will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits <,,>  
because <,> we find the time constraint <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#152:1:A>
Now what happens is this <,,> Canada is a bilingual country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#153:1:A>
As I already said at the <,> said at the outset <,> that there are  
<,> language problems <,> and there are <,> nationality problem <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#154:1:A>
There is a talk of separation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#155:1:A>
But here is a message <,> from <,,> a French woman writer <,,> who  
seems to be advocating <,> the coexistence <,> of the two <,> and not  
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#156:1:A>
<-> He </-> <,> she <,,> seems to be possessing <,> that English  
<,,> is alright for the French <,> because the French <,,> as you know <,>  
hate <,,> English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#157:1:A>
They hate everything that is English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#158:1:A>
They would not <,> speak a word in French Canada <,> if you talk  
to them in English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#159:1:A>
That is not acknowledged <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#160:1:A>
So this type of hatred should cease <,> because English <,>  
learning <,> has its own advantages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#161:1:A>
And she seems to feel it <,> that <,,> there could be harmony <,,>  
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-039#162:1:A>
At a party she invites <,,> she invites <,,> all the types of  
people available there <,,> </I>
