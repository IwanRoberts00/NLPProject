<ICE-IND:S1B-045#12:1:A>
Professor Laxmanan <,> can you describe Mukundapuram to us <,> your

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#13:1:B>
Why not Mr Hemant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#14:1:B>
Mukundapuram is a place so nice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#15:1:B>
It may attract so many people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#16:1:B>
Uh I think <w> it's </w> outside appearance is <,,> uh extra
beautiful <,> in all senses <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#17:1:B>
There is <,> uhm one place called <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#18:1:B>
Which can be converted into a best tourist centre <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#19:1:B>
<O> One word </O> includes my constituency <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#20:1:B>
And <,> and there is another place called <?> Malaytoor </?> and
<?> Malaytoor </?> attracts so many pilgrims <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#21:1:B>
And one <?> Irykod </?> near the famous Kudvillur <indig> devi
</indig> temple <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#22:1:B>
Uh and it is supposed that <,,> St Thomas came first to this place
<,> in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#23:1:B>
He landed at <?> Irykod </?> <,,> says so the history <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#24:1:B>
And <?> Irykod </?> is very near to <,> that <indig> devi </indig>
temple <,,> Kudvillur

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#25:1:B>
And uh <,> Kudvillur <indig> devi </indig> is supposed to came from
that Kannagi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#26:1:B>
<w> You've </w> heard the story of Kannagi <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#27:1:A>
Not really ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#28:1:B>
Uh <,> Kannagi also is related to south India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#29:1:B>
That may be the reason <w> you've </w> not heard <?> or to </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#30:1:B>
She is a powerful goddess

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#31:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#32:1:B>
And uh about <,> my own place in Srinelkuda there is a famous
temple <,> Kudmadikum <indig> Shree </indig> Kudmadikum temple <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#33:1:B>
In which Lord Bharda <,,> is the deity <,> and <,> Lord Bharda uh
<,> and no other places in India there is Lord Bharda <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#34:1:B>
Only at <?> Yetinedkuda </?> people says so <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#35:1:B>
But beyond all this <,,> Mukundapuram <,,> is very poor <,> and in
<w> it's </w> living uh people are very poor there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#36:1:B>
Uh or probably too old <,> or to meet the both ends meet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#37:1:B>
Uh so many are <,> labourers <,,> and they find it very difficult
to earn their <,> livelihood <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#38:1:B>
But <,> they are trying somehow or other and <,> they expect me to
help them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#39:1:B>
And uh <,> though even though it is very beautiful with lakes
rivers <,> paddy fields <,> trees etcetra etcetra <,> <w> we've </w> to uh
supply some food to them <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#40:1:A>
<w> That's </w> right

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#41:1:A>
You were saying before <,> uh <}> <-> we </-> <+> to </+> </}> me
here <,> that there is no such place as Mukundapuram on the map

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#42:1:A>
Is it true ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#43:1:B>
Uh <,> <w> there's </w> is a small village <,> it is it is
known as Mukundapuram <,> but uh no notable place <,> in this mean
Mukundapuram

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#44:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#45:1:B>
But constituency is named liked that Mukundapuram <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#46:1:B>
Uh it is connected uh with an old story that <,> Lord Mukunda <,>
this <indig> Vishnu </indig> <,,> had great place <,> in some good old days
<,> <{> <[> uhm uhm <,> and the place is named after <,> Lord Mukunda <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#47:1:B>
Mukundapuram <indig> puram </indig> means <,> town

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#48:1:B>
Town of Mukunda

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#49:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#52:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#53:1:B>
I want to do a lot for my people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#54:1:B>
But I don't know <,> whether all my hopes <,> will be fulfilled or
not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#55:1:B>
And I know very well that <,> uh all the needs of the <,> people
can not be fulfilled <}> <-> by my </-> <,,> <=> by me </=> </}> alone <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#56:1:B>
But I want to do something for the <,> ordinary people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#57:1:B>
By helping <,,> in some way or other <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#58:1:B>
<{> <[> <w> I'll </w> </[> do my best to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#59:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#60:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#61:1:A>
The teaching community and also that of students <,> they must also
be looking forward to you <,> to help from you of many kinds <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#62:1:B>
Then <w> I'll </w> help and allow them <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#63:1:A>
What can you <{> <[> do </[> for them as <,> as an M P <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#64:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#65:1:B>
To my all students <,,> I think <,,> uh I lost my students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#66:1:B>
This is the only grief <,> I have now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#67:1:B>
I lost the good field of <,> teaching

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#68:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#69:1:B>
It was so nice in my college <,,> with my students <,> and my
colleague <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#70:1:B>
But I do <,> I love <O> one word </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#71:1:A>
Do you <,> uh want to go back to teaching full time <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#72:1:B>
<w> That's </w> a <.> que </.> a very difficult question to
answer

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#73:1:B>
I don't know exactly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#74:1:B>
Uh people in my party ask me <,> you you are not contesting this
election <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#75:1:B>
<w> That's </w> why I came into politics

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#76:1:B>
And uh <,,> truly speaking I love <,,> all the topics in between
sky and earth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#77:1:B>
And I love politics too <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#78:1:B>
And I take it <,> as a challenge <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#79:1:B>
And for the first time I was facing an election <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#80:1:B>
Fortunately or unfortunately I won <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#81:1:B>
And now <,> uh I take my constituency <,> as my institution <,> to
which <w> I'm </w> so fond of <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#82:1:B>
I think <,> uhm now Mukundapuram constituency is my St Joseph
College <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#83:1:A>
One thing <,> uh now that <w> you've </w> become member of
parliament <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> has the attitude of your students <,> or that
of your collegues changed towards you ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#84:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#85:1:B>
Uhm I think no <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#86:1:A>
Do they notice a change in you <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#87:1:B>
I don't know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#88:1:B>
Uh I want to be with them <,> uh in the <,,> what I want to say <,>
<w> I'm </w> the old Savitri Laxmanan <,,> <{> <[> among </[> them

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#89:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#91:1:B>
And <w> I'm </w> sure that <w> they'll </w> consider me as
their old Savitri Laxmanan

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#92:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#93:1:A>

<w> It's </w> a reputed firm in Kerala

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#104:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#105:1:B>
It is published some <,,> fifteen or sixteen years back <,,>

And I took the female part <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> in my own

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#111:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#112:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> a rare oppurtunity for <,> a woman
artist <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#113:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sure it must be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#114:1:A>
How long has been your association with <mention> All India Radio
</mention> <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#115:1:B>
Uh I too <,,> may <,,> for the past fifteen or sixteen years
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#116:1:B>
I was participating in <,> radio plays

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#117:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#118:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> approved as a staff artist there in <mention>
All India Radio Trichur </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#119:1:B>
They used to take

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#120:1:B>
I used to participate in <,> some of the plays

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#121:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#122:1:A>
<w> You've </w> also done discussions for them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#123:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> <,> some discussions <,> some talks <,>
<{> <[> uhm uhm <,,> some speeches etcetera <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#124:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#125:1:A>
<w> You're </w> a teacher by profession <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#126:1:A>
One thing I would like to definitely ask you is <,> about your <,>
opinion on the education policy

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#127:1:A>
Do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the
whole nation <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#128:1:B>
What I know <,> of course Mr Hemant the education must be
uniform <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#129:1:B>
But it <w> it's </w> not practical <,> I think <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#130:1:A>
Why do you think so <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#131:1:B>
There are so many who seek <,> higher education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#132:1:B>
But I think ours <,> is a poor country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#133:1:B>
For that <,> uh <w> we're </w> unable to fulfill the hopes of the
<,> rising students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#134:1:B>
So private schools must be encouraged in my opinion

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#135:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#136:1:B>
I say so because <,> in my state <,,> there are some who says
that <,> all must be <,> uhm government oriented education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#137:1:B>
Private school must be abolished <,> from the field <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#138:1:B>
But I don't think so

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#139:1:B>
Because in our state <,> private school and private colleges are
doing a lot for the <,> students

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#140:1:B>
<w> They're </w> not making second rate citizens sort

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#141:1:B>
But that <,> uh when that is some <,> round about now a days our
school <,> rise people say <,> these schools are creating second rate
citizens <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#142:1:B>
I feel that is what <,> I think

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#143:1:A>
Do you also think the medium of instruction <,> <{> <[> ah
<,> should be uniform <,> or that uh <,> the three tier system that now exist
<,> is all right <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#144:1:B>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#145:1:B>
Uhm <,> <w> we've </w> to give due importance to the both
language English <O> one or two word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#146:1:B>
In my case too <,> I bid farewell to <,> this <,> uh international
language from <O> one word </O> back because <,> <w> I'm </w> a professor of
my original language <,> Malyalam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#147:1:B>
And I used to talk <,> and write <,> always in Malyalam <,> and
now I almost forgot English

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#148:1:B>
But <,> when I became an M P <,> English is the only force through
which I can communicate my ideas <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#149:1:B>
So also <,> with the other <w> M P's </w> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#150:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#151:1:B>
Some of them knew very well Hindi because Hindi is their
mother tongue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#152:1:B>
But <,,> they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#153:1:B>
The sole reason is that <,> they are not <,> uh uh trying to <,>
learn <,> or write this English

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#154:1:B>
So <,> English could be the link <,> language <,> in my opinion

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#155:1:B>
And then Hindi <,> our national language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#156:1:B>
That must be also given due importance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#157:1:B>
And <w> I'm </w> trying to learn Hindi <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#158:1:A>
Now uh <,> you are also based in Delhi <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,>
and when the <.> ses </.> when the parliament is in session <w> you've </w>
to <-> be </-> hear <,> <{2> <[2> ah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#159:1:A>
How how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-045#160:1:A>
When you are here

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#161:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#162:1:B>
<[2> Ah </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#163:1:B>
I always depend upon my little English <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#164:1:A>
Are you also <{> <[> comfortable </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-045#165:1:B>
<[> And I </[> </{> uh <w> I've </w> said <,> <w> I'm </w>
