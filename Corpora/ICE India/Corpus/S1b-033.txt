<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#1:1:A>
<O> One or two words </O> laid down their lives in the last
twelve month <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#2:1:A>
And since nineteen sixty-nine <,> when six brave policemen
patrolling in Leh <,> were ambushed and killed <,> by the Chinese <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#3:1:A>
But such acts of courage <,> have not really altered <,> the public
image of the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#4:1:A>
Ask any ordinary citizen of the country and <,> a city dweller <,>
or uh a peasant in a village <,> or indeed women <,> and they will tell you
<,> that police have quite sincerely tried to <,> enchained them at the level
of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#5:1:A>
Why this is so <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#6:1:A>
Is change really possible <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#7:1:A>
Is it impossible <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#8:1:A>
Why things not changing ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#9:1:A>
Who is at fault ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#10:1:A>
Who is to blame <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#11:1:A>
To answer these and several other question we have a hand picked
and distinguished panel <,> Mr M N Jacob <,> state Home Minister <,> Mr Soli
Sorabjee <,> eminent <,,> eminent Supreme Court advocate <,> and former
Attorney General <,> and Mr T Anantchari who is Director General of the
Border Security Force <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#12:1:A>
So you are <O> two words </O> <,> we can <,> start with you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#13:1:A>
You have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government
<,> and also of the police

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#14:1:A>
And you have said that <w> there've </w> been many human rights
violation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#15:1:A>
Why have you been saying this <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#16:1:B>
Well uh <,,> human rights violation <,,> I would <,,>
concentrate upon specially <,,> the method <,,> and the procedure <,> that
the police employ <,,> in investigation at the time of crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#17:1:B>
One of the things which we commonly find is <,,> the use of <,>
third degree method <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#18:1:B>
Sometimes even the <,,> recourse to torture <,,> in extracting
statements and extracting confessions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#19:1:B>
<w> There're </w> constitutional prohibition against it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#20:1:B>
When even the criminal procedure code <,,> has provisions against
the use of such methods <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#21:1:B>
But in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really
<O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#22:1:B>
Then one of the reasons which I find <,> because <w> I've </w> also
friends in the police force <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#23:1:B>
I know the <O> one word </O> we should understand their problems
<,> their difficulties they have to <,> cope with not ordinary criminals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#24:1:B>
But today these criminals are very well armed

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#25:1:B>
They have sophisticated technique <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#26:1:B>
So one of the <,> uhm excuses <,> reasons <,> to give forward is
<,> <w> it's </w> not possible <,> to deal with harden criminals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#27:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not practical <,> to investigate these cases unless
<,> we have recourse to these methods

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#28:1:A>
Mr Jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with
hardened criminals <,> without using third degree method <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#29:1:C>
I think it is a <,> mixed reaction because <,> it is not
suppose to be <,> a <,> torturous method <,> or a third degree method <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#30:1:C>
But at the same time <,,> there do come across some instances <,,>
where uh <,> unwanted methods are also adopted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#31:1:C>
And may be <,,> it has certain various reasons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#32:1:C>
We will have to find <,> the solutions now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#33:1:C>
<}> <-> I I </-> <,> <=> I </=> </}> will project it like this <,>
that we have to have more of <,,> team <,> <}> <-> trained </-> <=> well
trained </=> </}> <,,> in this task <,> of investigation or extracting the
truth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#34:1:C>
Modern methods will have to be used <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#35:1:C>
Then there will be more simplified <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#36:1:C>
The coarse methods <,> are rotten <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#37:1:C>
Sometimes as a hang-over of past <,> when you were not having <,>
any thing of that sort <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#38:1:C>
But by and large <,> <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> a all not a
general complaint

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#39:1:C>
It is an image that is projected outside <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#40:1:C>
But <,> I don't agree that totally it is true

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#41:1:C>
But there are cases

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#42:1:A>
But it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh <,>
coarse methods are used by the police Mr Anantchari <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#43:1:B>
Well I think this problem <,> you cannot uh <,,> discuss in
isolation

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#44:1:B>
I would like to <,> say <,> first of all <,> there can be no two
opinion <,> about the need to eradicate third degree method <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#45:1:B>
Police cannot adopt it as a method of <,> <w> that's </w> the
method or as a policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#46:1:B>
Having such reason I would like to say <,> that <,> police cannot
function diverse from <,> the cultural <O> one word </O> of the society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#47:1:B>
The legal system <,> the restrictions that it imposes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#48:1:B>
First of all I would like to say when I say cultural <O> one word
</O> of society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#49:1:B>
There is uh <,> that I am permitted to say

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#50:1:B>
We are having double standard in our <,> society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#51:1:B>
They would <,> say one thing in law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#52:1:B>
They expect something else to be done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#53:1:B>
<}> <-> <.> E </.> </-> <=> it </=> </}> depends on who is affected
and who is wanting to police <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#54:1:B>
I think that is the point <w> we've </w> got to understand

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#55:1:B>
We cannot run away <O> a few words </O> totally

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#56:1:B>
Secondly <,> in our country <,> everybody seems to be in great
hurry and want results <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#57:1:B>
And <}> <-> when it </-> <=> when they </=> </}> want results from
themselves they would like to adopt their own method <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#58:1:B>
And then the police becomes uh <,> important hand made <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#59:1:B>
This is one aspect of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#60:1:B>
Secondly you want to run the society on modern <,,> basis <,> on
terms of modern terms of modern concept <,> with a law which is totally
hackneyed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#61:1:B>
I do not know if very many of us know <,> that <,> the institution
called the FIR <,> this institution called the FIR first information report
is peculiar to the sub-continent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#62:1:B>
Nowhere else in the world do you have it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#63:1:B>
Once you write something in the FIR <,> it becomes impossible to
<,> even <-> the </-> telling the truth to get out of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#64:1:B>
So you will have to <,> often to satisfy the courts <,> add up <,>
the evidence to see that what you said in the FIR <,> uh come through the
investigation

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#65:1:B>
I think it is a very <?> big </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#66:1:B>
Third is <,> we must also when you <,> think of police image <,>
you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#67:1:B>
Thus they have the criminal justice system improve

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#68:1:A>
Has it uh Soli <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#69:1:D>
In fact I think that <?> specially </?> is relevent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#70:1:D>
Improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to <,>
sanction <,> tolerate <,> mitigate and absolve the police <,> from the use of
methods which are not correct <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#71:1:D>
I appreciate what Mr Anantachari has said about the double standard

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#72:1:D>
But what he meant by double standards and people want results is
really the <O> two words </O> of the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#73:1:D>
Orders come from political bosses from people in authority <,> to
see <- > there </-> one of their cousins and one of their friends <,> who is
being investigated <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#74:1:D>
Policemen says <indig> baba kya karega </indig> <,> order <indig>
ho gaya </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#75:1:D>
There are exceptions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#76:1:D>
There are some bail source <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#77:1:D>
Another way the order comes <,> when they want their political
rivals to be arrested

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#78:1:D>
Order goes to the police station <,> and the orders are carried out

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#79:1:D>
So I entirely agree about the double standards

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#80:1:D>
And I think the real <,,> if I must say so <O> one word </O> of the
police is the politicisation of the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#81:1:D>
And that must stop <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#82:1:D>
Because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out <,>
just in order <,> not to get into trouble

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#83:1:D>
They may be transferred they may be suspended <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#84:1:D>
But criminal justice system has not improved by means <O> one or
two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#85:1:D>
The delays in the criminal justice system <,> investigation as part
of the criminal <-> system </-> justice system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#86:1:D>
And if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not
<O> one word </O> naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the
criminal

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#87:1:A>
Yeah Soli <,> politicisation is there

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#88:1:C>
I was just <,,> trying to <,,> uh see through your word
politicisation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#89:1:C>
Because uh my experience <,,> I think <,> that there is not
politicisation <,,> as <,> people imagine

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#90:1:C>
Because every political party come to the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#91:1:C>
Everyone has a faith in police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#92:1:C>
And even in India <,> the states and states differ in political
systems <,> <?> seldom </?> changes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#93:1:C>
So everyone come to uh power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#94:1:C>
One party or other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#95:1:C>
And the police had to follow a middle course <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#96:1:C>
They are not <,> pressurise <,> by the politicians <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#97:1:C>
Even if the pressure goes <,> police is not <,> listening to a
politician <,> because it is the system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#98:1:C>
But I see <,> the very fact that all the party <,> people or
politicians are relying on the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#99:1:C>
Irrespective of <,> nature of the government

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#100:1:C>
I think <,> though there is some truth sometimes someone may <,>
<O> one word </O> it

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#101:1:C>
But it may not be a genuine case <,> that there is the
politicisation of the police force in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#102:1:C>
I beg to differ from <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#103:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#104:1:D>
Mr Jacob what <w> you're </w> saying is that all political
parties manipulate the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#105:1:D>
As far as <O> one or two words </O> I am not <,> picking out one
political party

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#106:1:D>
What you are saying comes to these all politicians

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#107:1:C>
No no <,> I am the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#108:1:B>
I think <w> they're </w> well independent in their own
investigation

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#109:1:D>
Well I wish that was true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#110:1:D>
I don't blame the police

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#111:1:A>
Mr Anantachari why don't you <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#112:1:B>
In fact in fact <,> I thought I should <,> appropriately get
an opportunity to <,> <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#113:1:A>
You will have it right <{> <[> now </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#114:1:B>
<[> Because </[> </{> <,> because the whole thing arouse out
of my <,> statement which are in two parts

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#115:1:B>
One when I mentioned <,> about the criminal <,> justice system and
second about double standard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#116:1:B>
This double standard <,> I related to the cultural <O> one word
</O> in the society <,> as a whole <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#117:1:B>
It is <,> if you ask me <,> it is not merely the politicians <,>
it is a neighbour

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#118:1:B>
If your house is burgled <,> so long as his house is not burgled
<,> the neighbour will keep quiet <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#119:1:B>
When his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any
method to get his <{> <[> things </[> howsoever <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#120:1:D>
<[> Correct </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#121:1:B>
So I am only <,> this this runs through our society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#122:1:B>
And I must say <,> as a policeman <,> as a well meaning policeman
<,> as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if
there are reforms required <,> with a high sense of motivation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#123:1:B>
Uh <,> I would like to say that <,,> this is uh I think which is a
very important uh <,> factor that hampers the police

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#124:1:B>
That is the one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#125:1:B>
And not this kind of effort <,> would policeman change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#126:1:B>
Second I must also clarify <-> was </-> the criminal justice
system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#127:1:B>
Today <,> there is no point uh <,> in saying that uh <,> police
role should change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#128:1:B>
I think the police have to change a lot

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#129:1:B>
There is no doubt about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#130:1:B>
There are good people there are like any other organisation <,>
institutions <,> there are also bad people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#131:1:B>
But <,> only thing supposed to be accountable to law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#132:1:B>
If the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and
I am very sure <w> we'll </w> have very well behaved police <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#133:1:B>
Today there is so much of tolerance

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#134:1:B>
So much of <,> <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#135:1:B>
So much of <,> uh looseness in the entire judicial process that
you see

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#136:1:B>
When I say judicial process <,> it started <,> it is <,> uh
something you will <}> <-> form to </-> <+> find at </+> </}> all the levels
of judiciary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#137:1:B>
Whether it is prosecution <,> whether it is defence whether it is
uh <,> administration of justice

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#138:1:B>
So <,> therefore I feel that police is only one of the links of
<O> one word </O> system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#139:1:B>
And it is the one that is the cutting edge

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#140:1:A>
But Mr Anantachari before we loose <,> track of politicians
<,> would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they
<,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#141:1:B>
You see politicians may or may not apply <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#142:1:B>
But it is upto the police officer

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#143:1:B>
I <,> I would like to say <,> that I have <,> this holding
important charges as SP DIG <,> DIG CID in the state <,> various jobs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#144:1:B>
Politicians have <?> continued </?> with this <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#145:1:B>
They have tried to <,> also put some pressure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#146:1:B>
But it did not <,> do and explained to them most of the time they
did not interfere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#147:1:B>
And if you kept your end clean <,> I think very few politicians
really try to interfere with you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#148:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a question of <,> <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> a
double game <,> that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#149:1:B>
I <{> <[> think both have to <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#150:1:A>
<[> Soli what is in </[> </{> your experience <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#151:1:D>
I think we repeat itself of course if we say so

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#152:1:D>
The fact of the matter is <,> pressure is a fact

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#153:1:D>
And money <O> two words </O> politician <,> don't think even
politician even the <,> industrialist <,,> capitalist <,,> people <,> wealthy
people <,> people who built ill-terms and power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#154:1:D>
They do <?> trap </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#155:1:D>
Let me ask one question <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#156:1:D>
Why is it <,,> that despite of so called failure of the criminal
justic system <,> a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a
court of law before a magistrate than before a police <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#157:1:D>
Why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#158:1:D>
Why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule
caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#159:1:D>
<w> I'm </w> talking of rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#160:1:D>
The reason is <,> and I don't say that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#161:1:C>
Why do you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#162:1:A>
Why <{> <[> don't you let Mr Jacob </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#163:1:C>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#164:1:D>
I <w> I'll </w> complete the question

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#165:1:D>
The reason is the perception <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#166:1:D>
May be it is an exaggerated perception <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#167:1:D>
But it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally <,>
police is an instrument <,> of the system <,> and that system is oppressive
as far as the <,> landless <,> as far as the <,> deprived sections are
concerned

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#168:1:A>
Mr Jacob would you <{> <[> say the police is for the rich
</[>

<$C>

<[> No <w> I'm </w> <w> I'm </w> </[> </{> I am afraid that I
may not be able to agree with Sorabji <,> though <w> I've </w> <,> <w> I've
</w> tremendous respect for him as a lawyer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#170:1:C>
But yes <,> every police station in India <,> is almost crowd of
these all these people <,> who are <,> who are affected someway or other <,>
the women <,> the backward <,> the weaker section <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#171:1:C>
I don't think they are afraid of going to a police station <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#172:1:C>
They don't go to the police station

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#173:1:C>
The first thing they will do <,> is to go to the police station
and report the crime <,> whatever happened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#174:1:C>
Then of course we have go to the court

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#175:1:C>
So <,> I think by and large <,> the police stations are crowded
<,> and the <w> policemen's </w> workload is also very heavy <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#176:1:D>
Correct

But Mr Jacob <,> please ask the several <w> NGO's </w> <,>
non-governemntal organizations <,> who appear on behalf of <,> landless
labour <,> <O> one word </O> workers <,> you will get more precise
information and statistics from them <,> as to how they really fear entering
a police station <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-033#179:1:C>
May be you may be right in saying <,> but there is no reason
for the fear <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-033#180:1:C>
But the whole impression that has been built up in some of the
areas is <,> landlords <,> vested interest are in cohout with the police <,>
