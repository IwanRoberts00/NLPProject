<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#5:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> STROKE </smallcaps> </bold> represents the most
common and devastating disease of the central nervous system.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#6:1>
The third leading cause of death in the developed countries, it
accounts for a large number of hospital admissions in India as well.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#7:1>
However, if the public is made sufficiently aware of stroke and its
causes, they will be able to use existing medical facilities optimally, to
prevent and delay its premature occurrence, disabilities and death. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#8:1>
Stroke is also referred to as a cerebro vascular accident.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#9:1>
Acute cerebrovascular disease is defined by the World Health
Organization as <quote> " Rapidly developed clinical signs of a focal
disturbance of cerebral function of presumed vascular origin and of
more than twenty-four hours duration." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#10:1>
There are two major sub-groups of stroke based on their causes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#11:1>
Stroke can result from a reduction or temporary cessation of blood
supply to the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#12:1>
This is called ischemia.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#13:1>
Strokes can also arise due to bleeding within the brain or its
covering membranes, known as haemorrhaging. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#14:1>
The brain is supplied with blood carried by two arterial
systems consisting of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries
and the vertebral and basilar arteries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#15:1>
There are enough anatomical connections and regulatory mechanisms
between the two systems to ensure efficient blood supply.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#16:1>
The brain requires a rich blood supply containing adequate oxygen and
glucose and other essential metabolites.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#17:1>
The reduction in blood supply can be general or local, transient and
incomplete, or prolonged and complete.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#18:1>
If the deprivation is incomplete and persists for less than ten
minutes, death of nerve or brain tissue does not occur.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#19:1>
If complete and prolonged, it results in death of tissue termed as
infarction.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#20:1>
The site and extent of the infarction determines whether the
disability is to be mild or severe and whether the event is going to be
fatal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#21:1>
There are several reasons for reduced blood supply, the main
being the narrowing of the intra- and extra-cranial arteries supplying the
brain, due to a process of thickening and stiffening of the blood vessels (
atherosclerosis).

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#22:1>
Apart from these changes <O> <&> page </&> 46 </O> involving local
blood vessels, conditions which alter the rhythm of the heart and reduce
blood pressure can cause a reduction in blood supply to the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#23:1>
Blood clots can obstruct the cerebral blood vessels and cause tissue
death ( infarcts).

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#24:1>
Besides, the blood itself may thicken and become more viscous
contributing to sluggish flow, clot formation and eventual obstruction.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#25:1>
<h> <bold> Intra-cranial bleeding </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#26:1>
One in every four to six strokes is an intra-cranial haemorrhage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#27:1>
Bleeding can take place inside the substance of brain in which case
it is known as intraparenchymal haemorrhage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#28:1>
It can also occur under the covering of the brain, a condition called
sub-arachnoid haemorrhage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#29:1>
Sometimes, this type of haemorrhage extends into the cavity of the
brain and is called intraventricular haemorrhage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#30:1>
Blood, when it flows through blood vessels is essential, as it
contains life-supporting oxygen and glucose.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#31:1>
However, when it leaks out of the cerebral blood vessels, it
irritates and destroys the brain tissue.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#32:1>
An expanding blood clot and the swollen tissue surrounding it
compress normal brain tissues, as the volume of the skull is fixed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#33:1>
When the vital structures of the brain stem are compressed, a
profound loss of consciousness, respiratory difficulties and even death
can result. </p> <&> Across first and second columns </&> <O> Photograph </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#35:1>
Indications of inadequate blood supply to the brain depend on the
site of the lesion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#36:1>
Common symptoms include visual impairment or loss of sight in one
eye, weakness in an arm and / or leg, weakness of the facial muscles,
difficulty in speech or inability to speak and abnormal sensations in the
arms and face.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#37:1>
Other symptoms are intense giddiness, double vision, fits and
headaches.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#38:1>
Intense headaches, vomiting and loss of consciousness indicate a
more serious injury and are often fatal.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#39:1>
Ischemic strokes, that is, strokes due to diminished blood supply,
are of three types, differentiated on the basis of the temporal onset.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#40:1>
These are: transient ischemic attacks ( TIAS), which cause a
neurological deficit lasting for less than 24 hours, progressive
stroke, and completed stroke. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#41:1>
It is very important that the patient pays enough attention to
transient short-term symptoms and seeks medical care for them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#42:1>
This is so because such symptoms are warning signals for the
potential danger of a full stroke.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#43:1>
It is estimated that after the first warning symptom there is a
five to six per cent chance per year of a stroke recurring.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#44:1>
Aggressive investigations and treatment are required even for
patients with early warning symptoms. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#45:1>
<h> <bold> Risk Factors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#46:1>
The causes of stroke in some ways might vary from country to
country.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#47:1>
The risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipoproteinaemia ( presence of excess fat-protein complexes in the
blood), smoking, previous TIAS, coronary artery disease and a sedentary
life-style, stress and obesity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#48:1>
In India, modernization and industrialization have introduced
stressful life-styles which have contributed to a rising incidence of
hypertension and atheroscelerosis.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#49:1>
However, rheumatic heart disease; infective endocarditis (
inflammation of the heart lining and its valves due to infection);
tuberculosis of the blood vessels; post-delivery venous disease; anaemia
and sickle cell disease are equally important causes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#50:1>
Another important aspect is the phase of life in which stroke
occurs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#51:1>
After eighty, the chances of having a stroke are enhanced because the
arteries generally harden at this phase of life, even if heart disease,
cancer and trauma have not yet taken their toll.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#52:1>
Hypertension and diabetes both individually and together hasten the
tempo of the atherosclerotic process and might precipitate a stroke as early
as in the fifties or sixties.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#53:1>
Strokes occurring in people less than 40 years of age, are known as
premature strokes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#54:1>
They can be averted by recognizing, identifying and tackling the
causative factors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#55:1>
In the West, the incidence of strokes and the resulting mortality
has declined by more than 40 per cent, while <O> <&> page </&> 47 </O> <O>
Photograph across two columns </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#56:1>
<bold> <it> CT scan showing bleeding ( haemorrhage) in the brain
substance ( white portion) </it> </bold> </O> the long-term survival rate has
improved by more than 60 per cent over the last three decades.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#57:1>
This has been possible largely because of early identification,
regular treatment of hypertension and an awareness of the longterm
ill-effects of hypertension.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#58:1>
This appears to be a very important lesson for developing countries
where the incidence of hypertension appears to be rising and a decline in
the incidence of strokes is not evident. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#59:1>
<h> <bold> Investigations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#60:1>
In most cases, the diagnosis of a complete stroke can be made
even by a layman.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#61:1>
However, accurate diagnosis needs to be made by the doctor in less
typical cases.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#62:1>
Several investigative facilities help in the accurate
identification of the location and the extent of stroke and the time at
which the infarct or haemorrhage occurs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#63:1>
Computerized tomography ( CT) scans of the brain, carotid
angiography, the digital substraction technique, neuroimaging techniques
such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), single positron emission
computerized tomography ( SPECT), positron emission tomography ( PET) and
trans-cranial colour-coded real-time sonography and flow-imaging, colour
Doppler flow-imaging and radionuclide angiography help us know more about
the total and regional blood-flow and about obstructions to the normal and
affected brain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#64:1>
Not all investigations are necessary in every case, besides some may
be available only in major teaching hospitals and research centres.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#65:1>
The investigations help a doctor <O> <&> tantalizer 2 </&> </O> to
decide the mode of therapy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#66:1>
Platelets in blood play an important role in clot formation which
in turn obstructs brain arteries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#67:1>
Drugs which prevent platelet aggregation have been extensively
studied and used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#68:1>
Aspirin is a very important drug in the treatment of TIAS as well
as for prevention of stroke recurrence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#69:1>
Dipyridamol and sulphinpyrazone are other agents used.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#70:1>
Ticlopidine is a newer agent which acts on the platelet membrane.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#71:1>
Anti-coagulants are sometimes useful to treat and prevent worsening
in very early stages of acute strokes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#72:1>
Thrombolytic therapy which has been revolutionary in coronary artery
disease is in a trial stage and may prove useful for treating strokes as
well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#73:1>
Pentoxifyllin is one drug which finds application on account of
its property of reducing blood thickness, low molecular weight dextran also
causes haemodilution ( thinning of the blood). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#74:1>
In some carefully selected patients extra-cranial or
intra-cranial by-pass operations can be performed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#75:1>
The agents which reduce the brain swelling and resulting cranial
pressure are - - mannitol; dexamethasone; a corticosteroid, and, glycerol.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#76:1>
The blood clot can be surgically aspirated in only a few selected
patients with haemorrhage. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#77:1>
<h> <bold> Rehabilitation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#78:1>
To the patients who were previously physically independent,
stroke may turn out to be an illness worse than death itself.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#79:1>
Impaired movements and mobility, affected vision and speech
represents an end to an useful life.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#80:1>
Dementia occurs in a sizeable number of stroke patients.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#81:1>
Depression following a stroke is a frequent problem which interferes
with rehabilitation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#82:1>
Communication deficits, weakness in the hands and legs and
difficulty in carrying out daily activities are the major handicaps which a
stroke patients faces.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#83:1>
Often a loss of occupation results in economic dependence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#84:1>
The <w> patient's </w> attitudes, life satisfaction and well-being
change profoundly and adjustment with family or friends becomes difficult
or impossible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-010#85:1>
Patients recovering from a stroke should be made aware of the
importance of physiotherapy in preventing muscular contractures and
wasting due to disuse, which sometimes occur due to paralysis following a
stroke.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#86:1>
The average duration of hospitalization is two to three weeks.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#87:1>
In developed countries, institutionalized care is available to a
large number of patients.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#88:1>
Howver, an early discharge and return to the family and community
is advisable to promote favourable changes in personal, physical and
psychological behaviour.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#89:1>
Biofeedback methods like electromyography ( EMG) are used to retrain
muscles affected by stroke.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#90:1>
EMG involves the use of instruments to visually or audibly record
the electrical activity of skeletal muscle as a means of diagnosing
neuromuscular disorders and in biofeedback training.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#91:1>
A caring spouse or attendant can play a major role in early physical
recovery, ormities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-010#92:1>
