<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#1:1:A>
The teaching of English in the schools <,,> is extremely faulty
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#2:1:B>
True <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#3:1:A>
So can you identify the areas <,,> where basically the problem
lies with students of English in the schools <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#4:1:B>
In <,> in the area of pronunciation sir <,> I have <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#5:1:A>
Uh <,> is okay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#6:1:B>
Laid down on many problems <,,> that uh <,> one is that <,>
they don't maintain the length of the vowels <,,> and they <,> shift <,>
there is a phonemic alternation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#7:1:B>
In place of one vowel <,> they use <,> uh the other vowel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#8:1:B>
Like uh <,> in uh <,> while saying the word zero <,> some of my
students say jero <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#9:1:B>
Some will say zero <,> but the others will say <,> jero <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#10:1:B>
So there is phonemic alternation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#11:1:B>
Some will say <,> amit <,> but some will say omit <,,> some will
say oomit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#12:1:B>
Some will say <,> for example <,> obedience <,> obedience <,> some
will say abedience <,,> obedience <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#13:1:B>
So <,,> faulty pronunciation I feel <,> it <,> it travels into
their uh <,> uhm their whole career <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#14:1:B>
And uh <,,> from the very beginning we have got a faulty
pronunciation <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#15:1:A>
Ah now look at one thing <,> my problem <,> basically with
teacher of English is <,> not so much phonemic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#16:1:A>
I have <,,> a <,,> very serious <,,> doubt about <,> the grammar
<,> the lack of <,> <{> <[> really <,> grammar which the students have

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#17:1:A>
For instance <,> even at the M Phil level <,> <w> I've </w> come
across cases of students mixing up the tenses <,,> in the same sentence

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#18:1:A>
I mean <,> the present <{1> <[1> tense past tense and in one case
</[1> I discovered all the three tenses used in a long sentence <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#19:1:A>
And I said you have left out nothing <,> absolutely <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#20:1:A>
So <{2> <[2> <w> that's </w> </[2> one problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#21:1:A>
And I think <,,> much greater attention needs to be paid towards
<,> grounding <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#22:1:A>
I am not talking of <{3> <[3> I mean the traditional grammar but
atleast </[3> <,> the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to
the students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#23:1:A>
And what I find is <,> probably this is a deficiency <,> which
later on becomes incurable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#24:1:A>
Because what you are trying <}> <-> doing </-> <+> to do </+> </}>
is <,> what you do at the the school level <,> and what is going to be
confirmed at the undergraduate level <,> is what will survive eventually at
the postgraduate level <,> you see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#25:1:B>
<[> Really </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#26:1:B>
<[1> They use present and past and </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#27:1:B>
<[2> Even </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#28:1:B>
<[3> Basics of basics of English language is </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#29:1:B>
Sir <{> <[> don't you think they </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#30:1:A>
<[> So that is the </[> </{> structure <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#31:1:B>
Don't you think this deficiency lies some <,> to some extent
<,> uh with the teachers <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#32:1:A>
Exactly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#33:1:B>
They cannot <{> <[> impart uh the good in a <.> pro </.> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#34:1:A>
<[> Exactly exactly that of course </[> </{> is one part of it
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#35:1:A>
That I mean <w> it's </w> like the blind leading the blind in many
cases I mean <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#36:1:A>
The students <.> themse </.> the teachers themselves are not aware
<,> of the rules of grammar <,> they are themselves violating <{> <[> and
</[> naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#37:1:A>
For instance <,,> I came across some books <,> I mean <,> written
for students I mean <,> grammar I mean <,> general English for students of B
A one and B A two <,> by a <,> group of professors of various colleges three
four of them joining hands writing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#38:1:A>
And I discovered <,> the essays which were written one is
ungrammatical English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#39:1:A>
And I marked out certain portions <,> in which there were howlers I
mean and I said if this is the essay the student is going to read <,> and in
many cases commit to memory <,> what sort of English is the student
eventually going to learn from there <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#40:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> give just one example <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#41:1:A>
I forget which one are they but because some teachers gave <,> and
gave me <,> those copies I mean complimentary copies

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#42:1:A>
And I said <O> one word </O> let me glance through it <,> said
<indig> aap ki bacchi bhi padthi hai </indig> so but my daughter was in <,> B
A two or three at that time <,> so she will be of in need of some of them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#43:1:A>
So we are leaving these copies

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#44:1:A>
Alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the
right sort of English

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#45:1:A>
And I discovered and I infact told one of them <,> <quote> sir you
are an M Phil <,,> and is this the sort of English you <,> <.> your </.>
yourself writing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#46:1:A>
What better English will the students write if this is the sort of
<,> ungrammatical English you are writing </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#47:1:A>
So this is the basic fault

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#48:1:A>
I find <,> two basic problems with students <,> who come to my
department for instance one is <,> the grammar <,> lack of grammar

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#49:1:A>
The second is <,> lack of <,,> I mean what I would say vocabulary
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#50:1:A>
Vocabulary is sometime so deficient <,> that if I try to convey
something <,> I have to look through these basic English virtually at time
<,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#51:1:A>
Is that your Michael West I made use of <,> <{> <[> yes <,> at two
different stages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#52:1:A>
One when I was editing a play of Shakespeare <,> for students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#53:1:A>
Secondly when I was teaching at a place <,,> which is in a very <,>
backward area of Punjab <,> Bhatinda <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#54:1:A>
So there people told me that here <,> in English people are very
very deficient and they use a Hindi terms for it <,> <indig> angrezi mei
haath bada tang hai </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#55:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#56:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#57:1:B>
<indig> Haan haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#58:1:A>
So <,> I mean I said

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#59:1:B>
Typical <{> <[> Punjabi </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#60:1:A>
<[> Ah yes </[> </{> yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#61:1:A>
And they said Saxena <indig> saab </indig> <w> you'll </w> have to
teach English for a change in Hindi and Punjabi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#62:1:A>
I said at the <w> master's </w> level <,> you expect uh <,> there
is no help for it you will find it impossible <,> to convey anything to them
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#63:1:A>
I said <quote> don't worry <,> I will not come down to Hindi or
Punjabi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#64:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> teach them in English <,> of course <w> I'll </w>
have to be very careful in the choice of words <,> that I am going to use
</quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#65:1:A>
And that was the second time I made use of the Service List of
Michael West <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#66:1:A>
And what I did is <,> gradually <,> I would introduce everyday <,>
of course <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> involved lot of labour <,> seven
or eight new words <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#67:1:A>
And that was also <?> graded </?> I mean <,> these are the words
<w> I'm </w> introducing today these are words I am introducing tomorrow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#68:1:A>
And my effort was <-> an </-> every month <,> it should be around
two hundred words I should be able to increase in their vocabulary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#69:1:A>
And I discovered <,> their vocabulary was almost doubled by the
time <,> they completed the first session I did it <,> you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#70:1:A>
And naturally they would understand English better <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#71:1:A>
So what I find is that these are the two basic deficiencies <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#72:1:A>
Phonetics <,> is <,> yes it is deficiency <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#73:1:A>
But phonetics does not pose such a major problem

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#74:1:A>
You know why <,,> ? <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#75:1:A>
Because perhaps you have read also that there is now <,> a
consensus I mean atleast <,> that English can be pronounced <,> slightly
differently in different parts of the world I mean <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#76:1:A>
I mean Australians <{1> <[1> pronounced it differently </[1> <,>
Canadian <{2> <[2> pronounce </[2> it differently <,> America pronounce it
differently <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#77:1:A>
English that is to say the <w> Queen's </w> or the <w> King's </w>
English <,> is differently pronounced <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#78:1:A>
But then even in England <,> there is variation in pronunciation

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#79:1:B>
<[1> It is being </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#80:1:B>
<[2> America </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#81:1:B>
Regional variation <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#82:1:A>
Regional variations that fairly wide regional variations I
mean <,> even in England <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#83:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> what I find

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#84:1:A>
Phonetics is important in <w> it's </w> own way <,> but <w> that's
</w> not the be all and end all of teaching of English mind you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#85:1:A>
What is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary
rules of grammar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#86:1:A>
And what I find is <,> there is a very small book I came across
published by <mention> Times London </mention> <,,> at <O> two words </O>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#87:1:A>
The name of that book is in fact <w> that's </w> a series of books
maybe Pushpinder I <.> sho sho </.> showed you those books I mean <,>
<mention> A grammar in sixty minutes </mention> <,,> <w> that's </w> the
title of that book I mean <,> grammar in sixty minutes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#88:1:A>
We have one or two such titles in our department I think they got
them from there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#89:1:A>
Now <,> maybe not in sixty minutes <,> but that book of grammar
which gives the essential rules of grammar <,> can be <,> inculcated in the
students in about a <w> month's </w> time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#90:1:A>
And even that would be in a series <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#91:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> what I found out

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#92:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#93:1:A>
I don't know whether you came across that book <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#94:1:A>
But I keep on hunting for it <,> not at my <,> I am basically not
concerned with teaching of language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#95:1:A>
But I am concerned <,> of course with correctness of language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#96:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> in that context I <,> hunted out those books in
Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#97:1:A>
Maybe it could be some information for you also <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#98:1:B>
<O> Laughs </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#99:1:C>
So <w> it's </w> something about the <,> vocabulary why don't
you elaborate <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#100:1:C>
Means as far as <{> <[> your student </[> is concerned or your
teachers are concerned <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#101:1:B>
<[> Sir <O> two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#102:1:B>
Vocabulary true <w> it's </w> <,> it lacks <,> people lack
vocabulary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#103:1:B>
And uh <,,> sometimes even students they know <,,> the answer
sometimes <,> but they don't find words <,> to express themselves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#104:1:B>
And uh <,,> of course teachers help them and <,,> <{> <[> we are
</[> <}> <-> even </-> <=> even </=> </}> if

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#105:1:B>
<[> <O> word in Hindi </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#106:1:C>
He he talks about dictionary <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#107:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#108:1:C>
<w> That's </w> uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#109:1:A>
The dictionary habit

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#110:1:C>
<O> One word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#111:1:A>
And that is what students seriously lack <,> I tell you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#112:1:C>
For vocabulary

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#113:1:A>
They have to be made to look up the dictionary <,> and that
should be the habit <,> with I mean I <O> one word </O> that <{> <[> my
student </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#114:1:B>
<[> Every child </[> </{> should have

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#115:1:A>
If you are ten percent <{> <[> doubt consult </[> the
dictionary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#116:1:A>
Don't presume this is the meaning <,> because what you presume is
<w> it's </w> normally wrong

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#117:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> dictionary with him </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#118:1:B>
Normally wrong <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#119:1:A>
Go to a dictionary <,> and what I normally tell the students
is <,> have a big dictionary <,> on your desk

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#120:1:A>
A desk dictionary whether it is C O D <,> or whether <w> you've
</w> Chambers <,> depends on <,> whether you know phonetics or you don't know
phonetics one of these two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#121:1:A>
But keep a small dictionary always in your pocket <,> in the case
of girls they can in their <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#122:1:B>
Yeah <{> <[> purse </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#123:1:A>
<[> I mean </[> </{> purses I mean <,> a small one whether it
is Little Oxford Dictionary <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> or <,> <w> Collin's </w> Gem
Dictionary because <,> the problem with students many times is <,> they are
lazy

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#124:1:A>
They would not like to <,> go from one place to the other to lift
the dictionary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#125:1:A>
That is the hassel they won't like <{1> <[1> to </[1> do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#126:1:A>
If it is <{2> <[2> right in their pocket then perhaps they will
bring it out </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#127:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#128:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#129:1:B>
<[2> But <}> <-> if they have </-> <=> if they have </=> </}>
it in their bags they will </[2> </{2> just take it <{> <[> out and find </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#130:1:A>
<[> Yes it will become </[> </{> easier for them to consult
at time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#131:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what I have been telling my students <{> <[> again
and again </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#132:1:B>
<[> I always encourage </[> </{> them to <,> bring
dictionaries <O> cough </O> everyday <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#133:1:A>
Another book

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#134:1:B>
And uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#135:1:A>
Which I would mention and I <,> may be <w> it's </w> of some
use to you <,> that is <,> <mention> Elements of Style </mention> <,> by
Strung and White <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#136:1:A>
Have you seen it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#137:1:A>
We have six copies in our <}> <-> departmental </-> <+> department
</+> </}> in the main library

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#138:1:A>
And I find <,> it has hardly been issued <,> for so many years
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#139:1:A>
You see <,> <w> that's </w> of course an older edition

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#140:1:A>
I have a new edition revised edition <,> because the original was
written by Professor Strung <,> it has been revised by E D White <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#141:1:A>
You see <w> that's </w> not in paper back also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#142:1:A>
But paper back is also quite costly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#143:1:A>
But what I suggest is <,> atleast the teachers <,> who are
interested <,> can consult them <,> <{> <[> <mention> Elements of Style
</mention> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#144:1:B>
<[> <mention> Elements of Style </mention> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#145:1:A>
You know why <,> because <?> Fowler </?> is <,> formidable in
<w> it's </w> length <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#146:1:A>
Not everybody likes to consult or read it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#147:1:A>
But that <mention> Element of Style </mention> is just
ninety-eight pages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#148:1:A>
I mean <,> not very difficult to simplify it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#149:1:A>
And I find <,> I gave it some of my M Phil students <,> who had
problems with usage and all that <,> and they said it has been useful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#150:1:A>
And interestingly I discovered Pushpinder <,,> I was reading a
column in <,> this uh <,> <mention> Times of India Sunday </mention> <,> and
it there was an article by Nissim Ezekiel who said he was using this <,> very
book <,> for his M A students <,,> <mention> Elements of Style </mention> I
mean <,> <w> that's </w> what happened <{> <[> before </[> this Nissim
retired last year from <,> uh that Bombay University <,> so it is very good
for his students <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#151:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#152:1:A>
<}> <-> A </-> <+> By </+> </}> just a matter of chance I
discovered in that article that I mean the same thing I have been using also
<,> for my students <,,>

<$C>

About your teaching <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#156:1:C>
Teaching is more or less over you can talk of <,> what are your
plans for further <,> work <,> research if you are doing <,> or publishing or
anything else <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-078#157:1:B>
Sir <w> I'll </w> think of publishing it <,> and revise it
<,> and uh put in <,> all your suggestions <,,> that quantitative analysis of
the data <w> I'll </w> take up <,,> and <w> I'll </w> <,> get it published

for registering for the Ph D </quote> <,,> I said <quote> do you think you
stand to get anything by getting a Ph D in English </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-078#165:1:A>
