<X> <?> First read the </?> </X> Abstract <,> of the paper <,>  
titled <,,> <mention> development of grammar in animal communication systems  
<,> and in pidgins <,,> </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#2:1:A>
This paper comprises three sections <,,> <mention> Section one and  
two deal with animal communication systems </mention> <,,> and <mention>  
Section three with human communication systems </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#3:1:A>
To study <,> <mention> Animal communication system <,> the Washoe  
project <,,> in which a chimpanzee <,> learnt American sign language <,,> and  
the Lana Project <,,> in which a chimpanzee learns <,> rudimentary  
language-type systems </mention> <,,> are described <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#4:1:A>
The studies prove conclusively <,,> that chimpanzee <,,> separated  
from humans by a mere genetic whisker <,,> are unable to grasp <,> syntax <,>  
the combination of a finite number of signs <,> in an infinite number of new  
way <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#5:1:A>
It separates language <,> from other forms of communication <,,>  
such as <mention> Vocalisation <,> facial expression <,> gestures <,> which  
are all paralinguistics features </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#6:1:A>
Specifically till date <,,> we have no evidence of any animal <,>  
spontaneously evolving true language <,> without anybody to teach it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#7:1:A>
The only animal who does this is man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#8:1:A>
The focus in section three <,> is on human communication systems  
<,,> specifically how communication takes place <,> among speakers of pidgin  
languages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#9:1:A>
Theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of  
language <,> are explored <,,> as <mention> The single mutation theory <,>  
the innate propensity theory <,> the social pressure or need theory <,,> and  
the contact theory </mention> <,,> as they have specific relevance to pidgins  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#10:1:A>
A dozen examples of <mention> <w> Vendor's </w> English <,> <w>  
domestic's </w> English </mention> <,,> and <mention> Shipee English  
</mention> <,,> subsumed under the conventional title of <mention> Butler  
English </mention> <,,> an English pidgin spoken in India for over a century  
<,,> recorded from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-two <,> are listed  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#11:1:A>
They reveal modest language competence <,> in pidgin speakers <,>  
at the levels of morphology <,> syntax <,> and lexico-semantics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#12:1:A>
Extracts from Tay Boi <,> a French pidgin spoken in Vietnam <,> are  
listed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#13:1:A>
Similarities between it <,> and <mention> Butler English </mention>  
and <mention> English pidgin </mention> <,,> can be deduced <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#14:1:A>
This gives credibility to the claim <,> that all pidgins are  
similar <,> should refer to <mention> The innate propensity theory </mention>  
<,,> as they are forged in condition <,,> where the premium is on  
transmitting facts <,> withour frills <,,> it should refer to <mention> The  
social pressure or need theory </mention> <,> and <mention> The contact  
theory </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#15:1:A>
Similarities between the <mention> <w> chimpanzee's </w> <,>  
rudimentary language type system </mention> <,> and <mention> The pidgin <w>  
speaker's </w> <,> modest language competence </mention> <,,> have been noted  
and cross <,> referenced <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#16:1:A>
A common thread runs through the three sections of this paper <,>  
that language serves one basic function <,> that of communication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#17:1:A>
At no point is it suggested <,> that the three sections represent  
<,> a gradual progression <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#18:1:A>
No doubt animal communication systems and human communication  
systems are different <,,> for example <,,> <mention> Instinctive and  
interactive </mention> <,> and <mention> Innate and interactive </mention>  
<,,> but they are also similar <,> for example <,> limited structures <,> and  
innovative structures <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#19:1:A>
Finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication  
<,,> is in the final analysis <,,> compassion <,> for all forms <,> of life  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#20:1:A>
<.> Deve </.> <&> recording broken </&> The paper comprises three  
sections <,,> <mention> Section one and two </mention> deal with animal  
communication systems <,> and <mention> Section three </mention> <,,> with  
human communication system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#21:1:A>
I will concentrate only on the animal communication system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#22:1:A>
First of all <,,> what is communication? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#23:1:A>
<mention> Hockett in nineteen sixty </mention> <,> defined  
communication as <quote> An act <,,> by which one individual <,,> triggers  
the behaviour of another </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#24:1:A>
<quote> S. A. Altmann in nineteen sixty-seven </quote> <,,> stated  
that communication occurs <,,> when the behaviour of one individual <,>  
affects the behaviour of the other <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#25:1:A>
Although this definition is widely accepted by researchers <,>  
dealing with animal communication <,> it suffers from generality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#26:1:A>
Communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic <,,>  
verbal or non-verbal <,,> vocal or non-vocal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#27:1:A>
Verbal and non-verbal communication <,> do not represent  
discontiguous processes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#28:1:A>
Both are dependent upon similar complex coding <,> and decoding  
cognitive processes <,,> and to the extent that these processes are  
comparable between species <,> the abilities of different species to exchange  
information <,> will also be similar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#29:1:A>
Cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world <,> are a  
combined function of an <w> organism's </w> innate neurological equipment  
<,,> and his sensory-motor interactions <,> minus emotion <,> which is  
environmental surroundings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#30:1:A>
Speech is a communication system <,> superimposed on a biological  
process <,,> that of breathing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#31:1:A>
Communication systems <,> superimposed on two other essential  
biological processes <,> are that of eating <,,> and that of sex <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#32:1:A>
Now here are some examples of how birds <,> fish and mammals  
communicate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#33:1:A>
Most of the communicative features are non-linguistic <,>
non-verbal and non-vocal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#34:1:A>
I am going to specially <,> talk <,> about versatile behaviour <,>  
and intentional communication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#35:1:A>
Biologists observing animals have noted <,> that they are capable  
of versatile behaviour <,> and intentional communication <,,> which lead us  
to the conclusion <,> that animals can think <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#36:1:A>
Here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour <,,> from  
<mention> The Hindu </mention> nineteen ninety-eight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#37:1:A>
The Galapagos finch <,> uses specially shaped twigs <,> to prise  
out grub from a hole <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#38:1:A>
The green-backed heron <,,> breaks twigs into small pieces <,> and  
floats them on the water <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#39:1:A>
Minnows that are attracted to the twigs <,,> end up as lunch <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#40:1:A>
When the <w> beaver's </w> dam is damaged <,> and it is forced to  
make emergency repairs <,,> it discards familiar techniques <,> if they prove  
futile <,,> and tries novel strategies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#41:1:A>
<w> Termite's </w> nests <,,> despite hot temperatures <,> outside  
<,> maintain a certain level of coolness within <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#42:1:A>
When two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef <,,> one  
of them changes into a male so that the two can mate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#43:1:A>
<w> What's </w> more <,> the male fish can reverse back to a female  
<,> although not so easily <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#44:1:A>
The fish opts for a sex change <,,> as a long search for a mate <,>  
puts them at the mercy of a predators <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#45:1:A>
<quote> They are not good swimmers </quote> <,> says Phillip Munday  
of the James Cook University of North Queensland <,> in Townsville <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#46:1:A>
Japanese researchers support these findings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#47:1:A>
Finally <,,> wading birds migrate to New Zealand <,> after breeding  
in Alaska <,,> a non-stop trip of eleven thousand kilometres <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#48:1:A>
Before they migrate <,> they binge till upto fifty-five percent of  
their weight is fat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#49:1:A>
To compensate for the added weight <,,> they destroy a part of  
their internal organ <,> like the kidney and the liver <,> by up to  
twenty-five percent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#50:1:A>
When they land <,> they rebuild them again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#51:1:A>
Now <mention> Information Technology </mention> is perhaps the  
greatest revolution of this century <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#52:1:A>
There is the Internet <,> which links people all over the world  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#53:1:A>
But would you believe that insects too have a similar communication  
system ? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#54:1:A>
Just as we communicate physically and electronically <,> insects  
communicate through sounds <,> light <,> movement and chemicals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#55:1:A>
I am going to give you some striking examples of intentional  
communication <,,> from <mention> The Hindu </mention> in nineteen  
ninety-eight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#56:1:A>
In the insects communication system <,> the chemical used as a  
communicators are called <foreign> pheromones </foreign> <,> from Greek  
<foreign> pherien </foreign> to carry <,> and <foreign> hormaein </foreign>  
to excite <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#57:1:A>
The quantity of pheromones used <,,> their effective distance and  
specificity <,> all play an important part <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#58:1:A>
For example <,,> a female sex <}> <-> <.> <foreign> phor </foreign>  
</.> </-> <=> <foreign> pheromone </foreign> </=> </}> <,> can attract the  
male <,,> from a distance of two miles or more <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#59:1:A>
Male moths fly towards the smell zone <,> which increases as the  
male approaches the female <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#60:1:A>
Ants use these pheromones to communicate their message <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#61:1:A>
As one or two ants identify the source of food <,,> they leave an  
invisible line of <foreign> pheromones </foreign> called trail marking  
<foreign> pheromones </foreign> <,> on the ground <,> as they move <,> which  
can be sensed by ants following <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#62:1:A>
The ant is so meticulous <,> that it chooses the highly specific  
<foreign> pheromone </foreign> <,> which does not evoke responses from ants  
of other species <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#63:1:A>
Thus each possesses its own language <,> and higway code <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#64:1:A>
Ants produce a pheromone after their death <,> the odour of which  
immediately provokes worker ant <,> to remove the corpse <,> from the nest  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#65:1:A>
Some <foreign> pheromones </foreign> are used to warn friends of  
intending danger <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#66:1:A>
If you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive <,> the insect  
disturbed <,> sents off alarm phermones <,> which spread panic <,> through  
the nest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#67:1:A>
Dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea <,> they too  
communicate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#68:1:A>
They use unique signature whistles <,> to keep in touch with others  
<,> that are out of sight <,> says British zoologists 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#69:1:A>
And this is from <mention> The Hindu </mention> nineteen  
ninety-seven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#70:1:A>
And do fish talk? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#71:1:A>
In a way they do <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#72:1:A>
They tell each other how they feel <,> by the way they wiggle and  
blow bubbles <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#73:1:A>
Fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean <,> have a special  
way of communicating <,> they glow with a bright light <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#74:1:A>
Some light up to startle their prey <,> others just to say hello to  
each other <,,> <mention> The Hindu </mention> nineteen ninety-seven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#75:1:A>
Dr Cyndy Sims Parr of Michigan states <,> that <w> crows' </w> long  
distance caws <,> of which there are fifteen or twenty <,> have different  
meaning determined by their form and rhythm <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#76:1:A>
Various vocalizations can mean <,,> stay out of my territory <,>  
watch out <w> someone's </w> after your lunch <,,> or help me get this  
predator out of here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#77:1:A>
She says <,> that a string <mention> ko-ko-ko-ko-ko-ko </mention>  
means neighbour <,> <w> you're </w> tresspassing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#78:1:A>
In addition there are the many soft sounds crows make <,> when  
talking with family members like gargles <,> coos <,> squawks <,> squeals <,>  
and plaintive <w> <mention> oo-oo's </mention> </w> <,> for example <,>  
squeal means teasing one another <,> and <mention> <w> oo-oo's </w>  
</mention> <,> are cries of hunger <,> from <mention> The Hindu </mention>  
nineteen ninety-seven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#79:1:A>
And now <w> I'll </w> conclude with the dance of the honeybee <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#80:1:A>
For it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes <,> one of the  
most elaborate systems <,> of communication <,> C Russell and W M S  
Russell nineteen seventy-one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#81:1:A>
The dance was first noticed by Pastor Ernst <}> <-> Spitz <,> ner  
</-> <+> Spitzner </+> </}> in seventeen eighty-eight <,> but it was left to  
an Austrian zoologist Karl Von Frisch <,> to interpret the language of the  
honeybees <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#82:1:A>
For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize <,> in nineteen  
seventy-three <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#83:1:A>
When a Carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey <,>  
within about ten metres of the hive <,> she returns to the hive <,> and  
regurgitates drops of honey <,> which are eagerly drunk by other bees <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#84:1:A>
Then she begins to dance round in a circle <,,> this is called <,>  
the round dance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#85:1:A>
During the round dance <,> the bee runs in small circle <,>  
clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#86:1:A>
The bees who watch her <,> finds the new source of food <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#87:1:A>
The round dance therefore tells other bees <,> to search the near  
neighbourhood of the hive <,> and the scent on the dancers body <,> tells  
them what flowers to look for <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#88:1:A>
But honeybees have been known to forage for food <,> at distances  
of thirteen kilometres <,,> equivalent of thousand miles for a human being  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#89:1:A>
So when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres <}> <->  
and hun and hun </-> <=> and ten kilometres </=> </}> <,,> she returns to  
the hive <,,> offers the honey she has found <,,> and performs <,> a  
different <,,> kind of number called a tail wagging dance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#90:1:A>
In the case of the waggle dance <,,> the bee dances <,> tracing a  
<mention> Figure of eight </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#91:1:A>
Like the round dance <,> the waggle dance tells the bee that there  
is food available <,,> and what flowers to look for <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#92:1:A>
But it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are <,> and  
in exactly what direction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#93:1:A>
The tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food <,,> a  
quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source <,,> and a slow  
foxtrot tempo <,> a more distant one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#94:1:A>
Even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#95:1:A>
They can also vary in liveliness <,> and total duration <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#96:1:A>
They are livelier and longer <,> the sweeter the food <,> the  
easier it is gathered <,> the better the weather <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#97:1:A>
Minute details have been left out <,,> such as the waggle dance  
making the same angle with the sun <,> as the <w> honeybee's </w> flight-path  
did <,,> a complicated piece <,> of geometrical calculation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#98:1:A>
But even from this brief description it can be inferred <,,> that  
the system of communication evolved by the honeybees <,> is marvellous indeed  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-050#99:1:A>
Thank you <,,> </I>
