<bold> ABSTRACT </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#4:1>
The goal of language teaching is to develop the <w> learner's </w>
ability to communicate through the target language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#5:1>
Attaining linguistic competence alone cannot be adequate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#6:1>
Communicative competence enables the learner to relate the linguistic
structures to the social contexts and to select the appropriate structure in
a given context.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#7:1>
So the communicative approach to language teaching stresses the need
to develop the <w> learner's </w> ability to respond to the situation in an
appropriate manner with an appropriate structure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#8:1>
Phatic communion refers to a set of <quote> ` ready-made' </quote>
utterances with a conventionalized social meaning which are used to establish
social ties between the interlocutors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#9:1>
Lack of knowledge of these utterances often results in the <w>
learner's </w> poor performance in the target language and also leads to his
puzzlement sometimes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#10:1>
Hence it is argued in this paper that teaching the utterances of
phatic communication could be an integral part of all language teaching. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#11:1>
<h> 1. INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#12:1>
A conceptual distinction is sometimes made between a second
language and a foreign language in terms of the availability of a territorial
linguistic reference group within the country and the learnability of the
language in formal as well as informal settings and the utility or the
function the language in question may have in that society ( Stern 1983)
<fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#13:1>
The term second language has been used in this paper as
synonymous with any non-native language one wants to learn.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#14:1>
Thus, here it could include, for a Telugu learner, languages like
Tamil or Hindi for which environmental support is available within the
country, languages like French for which such environmental support is not
available and, finally English too, which, even though lacking such native
environmental support, nevertheless has a social, educational function within
our country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#15:1>
This is done so because, as Pit Corder ( 1973) puts it, <quote> ` as
far as the learner is concerned both [ i.e. the second language and the
foreign language] are equally strange' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#16:1>
For this reason, it is hoped that the conclusions of this paper can
confidently be generalized to all second ( non-native) language learning.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#17:1>
<h> 2. LEARNING LANGUAGES - ATTAINING COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#18:1>
A person learning a language other than his native language may
do so for <O> <&> page, right justiciaction </&> 111 </O> a variety of
reasons - business, educational, official, governmental, legal and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#19:1>
But it is a well recognized fact by now that it is not enough to
learn the grammar of the target language or even to be able to produce
grammatical structures in the target language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#20:1>
It is more important to learn and to know the appropriate
response/structure in a given context.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#21:1>
In other words, linguistic competence alone is not enough if one
wants to be successful in the target language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#22:1>
Rather, it pays dividends to develop what Dell Hymes calls
communicative competence, i.e. the communicative ability which helps the
learner select the socially and situationally appropriate utterance out of an
array of the possible grammatical utterances in a given context and makes his
speech more acceptable to the native speakers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#23:1>
Hence, the communicative approach to language teaching puts more
emphasis on the social contexts, situations, speaker-hearer relations,
formality or informality of the situation and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#24:1>
Thus, Littlewood ( 1981: 6) states the following four broad domains
of skill which a learner must attain <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> . 1)linguistic
competence, 2) knowledge of the communicative functions of the structures, 3)
skills and strategies to communicate meanings, 4) the social meaning of
language forms. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#25:1>
<h> 3. PHATIC COMMUNION - LANGUAGE TEACHING </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#26:1>
In the light of and in conformity with the communicative approach
to language, it is argued in this paper that due recognition be given to the
role played by what is called <bold> PHATIC COMMUNION </bold> in
second/foreign language learning.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#27:1>
Although phatic communion is entailed in the recognition of the fact
that linguistic forms have social meanings, its importance has not been
highlighted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#28:1>
In any language there may be certain utterances which are not
interpretable in the literal sense, but which have communicative value
overriding the semantic value.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#29:1>
Their potential communicative functions cannot be deduced from their
literal meanings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#30:1>
A perfect mastery of such utterances should obviously go a long way
in improving the <w> learner's </w> performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#31:1>
Phatic communion ( Malinowski : as quoted in Wardhaugh 1986 :
277) is a type of speech in which ties of union are created by a mere
exchange of words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#32:1>
Often they are <quote> ` ready-made utterances' </quote> as Lyons (
1968: 1177) calls them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#33:1>
These utterances of phatic communion are fully conventionalized
social acts ( Allerton 1979: 14) and have a role-affirming function.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#34:1>
Many linguists have recognized that often these utterances are empty
of meaning and that the fact they are used at all is more important than
their content.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#35:1>
Phatic communion has been explained ( Berne as quoted in Leech 1974:
63) as an adult substitute for the sort of reassurance a child requires.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#36:1>
Greetings, farewell utterances and certain routine questions fall
under this category.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#37:1>
Their literal meanings may vary from language to language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#38:1>
For example, the English <it> How do you do ? </it> and the French
<it> comment <foreign> allezvous </foreign> ? </it> ( = How are you going ? )
and the German <it> <foreign> Wie <w> geht's </w> </foreign> ? </it> ( = How
goes it ? ) and the Tamil <indig> ennange aale kaanooM </indig> ( = What sir,
you are not seen) <O> <&> page </&> 112 </O> are all instances of phatic
communion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#39:1>
In a majority of such phrases, their conventionally established
social meaning overrides their literal meaning and their purpose is to
establish social solidarity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#40:1>
Leech ( 1974: 62 ) thinks that the function of these phrases is to
maintain cohesion within social groups. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#41:1>
When a learner learns a language other than his own, very often
such utterances come as a surprise to him whose social meaning evades him for
some time.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#42:1>
But until the learner is quite at home with them, his speech sounds
alien.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#43:1>
Thus a knowledge of phatic communion seems important in at least two
respects: 1) it establishes social solidarity and correct equation between
the interlocutors, 2) the correct knowledge of such utterances saves the
learner from embarrassment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#44:1>
It must be noted here that the literal meaning of these examples
would not probably convey the intended meaning in other languages.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#45:1>
Only functional equivalents could be used in such places.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#46:1>
The wrong equation of these utterances across languages may sometimes
lead to misunderstanding because utterances whose social meaning is more
important than their literal meaning in one language may be taken in their
literal meaning in another language. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#47:1>
<h> 4. PHATIC COMMUNION IN HINDI </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#48:1>
1. In Hindi, as in any other natural language, there are certain
conversational openers ( which are used to initiate conversation between two
people).

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#49:1>
One of them is the following: <roman> 1 </roman> ) <indig> aur
sunaaiye </indig> <quote> ` Please tell me' </quote> ( lit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#50:1>
And make me listen) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#51:1>
A Telugu learner of Hindi, unaware of this fact, will probably
use <indig> boliye </indig> <quote> ` please tell' </quote> on the analogy of
the Telugu conversational opener <indig> ceppaNDi </indig> <quote> ` please
tell' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#52:1>
Though this is not unacceptable, it is nevertheless not frequently
used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#53:1>
<roman> 2 </roman> ) Sometimes the above form may be followed by
another conversational opener as follows : <indig> aur sunaaiye, kyaa haal
hai? </indig> <quote> ` Please tell me, what is the news' </quote> ? ( lit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#54:1>
And sir, make me listen, what is condition.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#55:1>
The learner, if unacquainted with such forms, may interpret it in
its literal sense and is puzzled. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#56:1>
<roman> 3 </roman> ) Yet another conversational opener is the
following : <indig> aur kaisaa <}> <-> cal </-> <+> chal </+> </}> rahaa hai?
</indig> <quote> ` Sir, how is ( life) going ? ' </quote> ( lit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#57:1>
And sir, how is going?) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#58:1>
As is the case with the previously cited form, this form may also
be interpreted in its literal meaning, which may lead to the <w> learner's
</w> puzzlement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#59:1>
<roman> 4 </roman> ) Another conversational opener of this kind
is the following : <O> <&> page, right justification </&> 113 </O> <indig>
saab, kyaa ho rahaa hai ? </indig> <quote> ` xxx ( a name ) sir, what is
happening ? ' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#60:1>
While this is just a casual enquiry in actuality, the second
language learner may be baffled as to its meaning, having interpreted it as
referring to some real event. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#61:1>
2. Similarly, there are certain casual responses in Hindi which
are solidarity-motivated and are <quote> ` ready-made' </quote> in nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#62:1>
If the second language learner is unfamiliar with them, he may find
himself tongue-tied in a conversational situation or is baffled when
encounters them. </p> i)

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#63:1>
<roman> 1 </roman> ) <indig> bAs jindaa huu </indig> <quote> ` o.k. I
am alive' </quote> ( lit.)

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#64:1>
<roman> 2 </roman> ) <indig> bAs <}> <-> cal </-> <+> chal </+> </}>
rahaa hai </indig> <quote> ` o.k. <w> it's </w> going' </quote> ( lit.)

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#65:1>
<roman> 3 </roman> ) <indig> gujar rahii hai </indig> <quote> ` <w>
It's </w> going on' </quote> ( lit.)

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#66:1>
3. There is a casual compliment in Hindi which is very frequently
used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#67:1>
Its nuances are numerous.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#68:1>
The variious situations in which it is employed and the different
senses it carries can be intriguing to the second language learner. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#69:1>
<indig> kamaal hai </indig> <quote> ` It is interesting, it is
amazing etc.' </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#70:1>
4. When young people seek their blessings, the elderly people
give the following blessing in Hindi.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#71:1>
This could be amazing to the second language learner. </p> <indig>
jite raho </indig> <quote> ` keep living' </quote> ( lit.)

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#72:1>
5. Finally, there is a form of enquiry which, though appears to
seek information from the listener, is primarily motivated by the solidarity
factor. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#73:1>
<indig> aap kahaaa ke rahane waale hai? </indig> <quote> ` Where do
you come from ? ' </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#74:1>
This seeks the place of origin of the addressee, but not the
present place of living.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#75:1>
But a Telugu learner of Hindi may interpret it to mean the present
place of living because of the Telugu construction, <indig> miirekkaDa
uNTunnaaru ? </indig> <quote> ` Where do you reside ? <-> ' </-> where the
verb <indig> uNDu </indig> to reside' </quote> is equated with the Hindi
<indig> rahana </indig> <quote> ` to reside' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#76:1>
5. In addition there are some constructions which are used not
simply for the sake of establishing rapport, but also in order to elicit /
communicate some information.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#77:1>
Although such utterances may not be, strictly, part of phatic
communion, they may be considered here for they too happen to be ready-made
utterances and are to be learnt in toto by the learner in order that he
understands those forms when others use them or is able to use them himself.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#78:1>
<roman> 1 </roman> ) When someone wants to buy something but has
not mentioned the specific brand he wants, the shopkeeper may ask <indig>
dekhiye saab, yeh <}> <-> calegaa </-> <+> chalegaa </+> </}> ? </indig>
<quote> ` Look sir, will it be alright ? ' </quote> ( lit. <quote> ` Look
sir, will it go ? <+> ' </+> </quote> ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#79:1>
<roman> 2 </roman> ) When someone is looking for a house, he may
ask <indig> bhaai saab yeh </indig> address <indig> kahaa paRegaa ? </indig>
<O> <&> page </&> 114 </O> Brother / sir, where is this address ( i.e. house ) ?
<-> ' </-> ( lit. <quote> ` brother/sir, where will this address fall ? '
</quote> ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#80:1>
<roman> 3 </roman> ) In the railway stations, when announcements
regarding the arrival of trains are being made, the following construction is
normally used. <indig> ek </indig> number platform <indig> pAr </indig> 1720
number <indig> gaaRii khaRii hai </indig> <quote> ` No.1720 train is (
standing) on platform number 1' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#81:1>
But, in the railway stations in Andhra Pradesh, it has been
observed sometimes that the following construction is used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#82:1>
<indig> ek </indig> number platform <indig> pAr </indig> 1720 number
<indig> gaaRii hai </indig> <quote> ` number 1720 train is on platform number
1' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#83:1>
The source of this construction, probably, is the Telugu
construction which is as follows. <indig> okaToo </indig> number platform
<indig> miida </indig> 1720 number <indig> raylu unnadi </indig> <quote> `
number 1720 train is on platform number 1' </quote> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#84:1>
<h> <bold> 6. CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-003#85:1>
To conclude, an attempt has been made to highlight the importance
of some conventionalized utterances, usually called phatic communion, in
speech interaction in establishing social relationships.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#86:1>
Evidently, such conventionalized utterances need to be taught to the
second language learner in order to improve his performance in the target
language. </p> <&> centered </&>

<bold> NOTES </bold> <footnote> 1

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#88:1>
Wilkins ( 1972) however, makes a threefold distinction, viz. The
second, Foreign and Alternate languages.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#89:1>
According to him, the Second language does not have native speakers
within the country in question.

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#90:1>
For him, it is an alternate language which has a territorial
linguistic reference group within the country. </footnote> <footnote> 2

<ICE-IND:W2A-003#91:1>
Although he states that they must be sought in foreign language
teaching, it seems reasonable, in the light of the point made in the above
sections, to think that they are equally essential in second language
learning situation too. </footnote> <&> centered </&>
