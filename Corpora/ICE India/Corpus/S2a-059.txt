<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-059#1:1:A>
Suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here
<,> and breathlessness may be there <,> and <,,> suddenly or within a few
hours <,> or the same day at any time <,> a person can die suddenly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#2:1:A>
Now this death <,,> when we say death <,> this is apparent death <,>
and this is uh <,> clinical death <,> there are various names for it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#3:1:A>
It means <,,> that the heart has stopped beating <,> say <,> and
there is no respiration the person is not breathing <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#4:1:A>
So that is but <,> the brain is still functioning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#5:1:A>
So till the brain is functioning <,> the man is not dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#6:1:A>
He is not really <,> dead <,> so he is not <,> biologically dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#7:1:A>
So <,> that <,> period is only about four minutes or so <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#8:1:A>
If during this four period of four minutes <,> before the <}> <->
<.> br </.> </-> <=> brain </=> </}> death occurs <,> we can revive the
person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up <,> again
<,> then the man can be revived <,> and he survives <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#9:1:A>
Now it has been <,> this period of four minutes is too short <,,>
for any doctor <,> to reach any place because <}> <- > <.> th </.> </-> <=>
this </=> </}> sort of death can occur <,> at any situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#10:1:A>
You are in the factory you are in the office <,> you are in the
college <,> wherever you are you see wherever you are on the road side <,>
this sort of thing can happen at any time <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#11:1:A>
Now when it happens <,> and there no doctor can reach <,> to do
anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#12:1:A>
So it is the passerby <,> the standers-by the people in the house
<,> who can <,> do everything to save <,> the life <,> and follow the
technique of <,> C P R that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#13:1:A>
It is a very very simple technique <,,> and anybody can learn it
<,,> <&> music for sometime </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-059#14:1:B>
So friends <,,> <w> we'll </w> just learn the technique of
cardio pulmonary resuscitation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#15:1:B>
By cardio I mean heart <,> pulmonary means lungs <,> and
resuscitation means revival <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#16:1:B>
Learning the technique <,> of reviving heart and lungs when it
fails <,> is what we call as cardio pulmonary resuscitation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#17:1:B>
Before we actually learn <,> what is C P R or cardio pulmonary
resuscitation is <,> <w> it's </w> uh imperative that we should know <,> as
to where the heart is situated <,> and what exactly is its function <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#18:1:B>
That heart <,> is just like a size of the fist <,> and is situated
in the centre of the <,> chest <,,> with the strenum or the breast bone in
front <,> and the spine <,> or the backbone behind <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#19:1:B>
And uh <,,> it pumps the blood to all the tissues of the body <,>
almost trillions of cells of the body <,> and the main target organs like
brain <,> which is the master controlling function of the body <,> the
kidneys liver and heart itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#20:1:B>
If the heart fails <,> that is the pumping action fails <,> the
death ensues <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#21:1:B>
And this death <,> is of two types <,> a clinical death <,> or what
we call a temporary death <,> and <,> a biological death <,> or a permanent
death <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#22:1:B>
The time interval <,> between this temporary death <,> and the
permanent death <,> is just four to five minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#23:1:B>
It is this time interval which is crucial <,> and we have to take
all the measures <,> of C P R <,> at this junture <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#24:1:B>
Now <,> before we learn the technique of C P R <,> it is very very
essential for us to know <,> is the individual alive or dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#25:1:B>
If alive <,> is he sleeping <,,> or he is unconscious <,> and there
are certain parameters by which we can easily determine <,> whether the
individual is dead or alive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#26:1:B>
Like for example <,> we must try <,> to say ask some question to
the patient <,> are you okay <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#27:1:B>
If he is not <,> if it there is no response <,> then we can just
pinch the skin <,> or we can press over the <,> upper portion of the eyes we
can just have a deep pressure <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#28:1:B>
If there is no response <,> that means the individual is not <,,>
uh not in a sleeping state <,> but he is unconscious or he may be dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#29:1:B>
Now how to distinguish whether he is dead <,> or <,> he is
unconscious <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#30:1:B>
We can easily see <,> the chest movements <,> or the breathing
movements <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#31:1:B>
If a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement
or you can bring the palm of your <,> hand and put it just in front of the
nostrills or over the <,> uh mouth <,> and we can <}> <-> <.> fe </.> </->
<=> feel </=> </}> some warmth of the air <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#32:1:B>
Or <,,> we can just bring the cheek <,> in front of the mouth and
the nose

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#33:1:B>
And if we can <,> feel the warmth of the air <,> we can say that
the individual is unconscious <,> but not dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#34:1:B>
And the third thing commonly which we should feel is <,> we can see
the carotids <,> the one of the arteries <,> which is very close to the adams
apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box <,> there is a groove
on the side of this apple <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#35:1:B>
Uh this uh <,> uh <,> adams apple <,> we can just feel the
pulsation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#36:1:B>
If we can feel the pulsation <,> we can say that the individual is
unconscious but not dead <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#37:1:B>
If you are not able to perceive the pulsation <,> and we say there
are no chest movements no signs of respiration and <,> uhm uh pulsation or
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#38:1:B>
And then we have to keep certain <mention> do's </mention> and
<mention> don'ts </mention> in mind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#39:1:B>
For example <,,> we should never try to keep a pillow under the
head <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#40:1:B>
Now why it is so <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#41:1:B>
The principle is <,> <w> I'll </w> just explain you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#42:1:B>
Whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils
or from the mouth <,> and whatever air he inhales <,> it goes through the
windpipe and goes into the lungs <,> and the air which is inhaled <,> goes
into the windpipe and the lungs expand <,> and the chest moves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#43:1:B>
If <,,> for example we just keep for example we are keeping a
pillow under the head <,> this windpipe is obstructed <,,> and there is a
narrowing of the windpipe

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#44:1:B>
You can see here <,> this red one this is windpipe it gets choked
<,> and there is no <,> free passage of air into the windpipe <,> and an
individual instead of saving him <,> he can just uh go into a sudden death
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#45:1:B>
So we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#46:1:B>
The second thing which we must keep in mind <,> we can put any
pillow or anything <,> under the legs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#47:1:B>
By doing so <}> <-> <.> wi </.> </-> <=> with </=> </}> the effect
of <,,> gravitation <,> we can push in <,> atleast <,> two to three bottles
of blood <,> into the brain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#48:1:B>
And just by doing so <,,> a patient may have a enough circulation
in the brain and he can be easily revived <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#49:1:B>
Just by a simple technique <,> of raising the legs <,> or raising
the <,,> pelvis of an individual <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#50:1:B>
The third thing <,> we must never put in <,,> any water <,,> or any
<,,> <.> sol </.> any solid <,,> in the individuals mouth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#51:1:B>
There is a risk <,> as the individual is either in a temporory
death or in a permanent death <,> whatever you put in the mouth will go into
the windpipe <,> and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any
passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#52:1:B>
If at all we find <,> that there is any vomitous <,> or there are
any secretions <,> any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some
foreign body or there is a <,> uh food material <,> or there is water
accumulated in the mouth our effort should be <,> to put in the finger <,>
and <,> wipe out the whole mouth and keep the patient <,> or the individual
<,> uh head on the lateral side <,> either on the right side <,> or the left
side <,> whatever is a convenient <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#53:1:B>
The next thing which we must keep in mind is <,,> we must assure
<,,> that <,> there is <,,> not a inch of crowd around the individual <,> if
there is a lot of crowd <,> we <,> obstruct the air to go into the patients
uh <,,> vicinity

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#54:1:B>
And we should see that there is a free entry of air <,> into the
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#55:1:B>
So these are certain <w> <mention> do's </mention> and <mention>
don'ts </mention> <,> which we must keep in mind

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#56:1:B>
Once <,> we do so <,> and we find <,> that still there are no signs
of life <,,> then we should start the technique <,> of what we call as <,> C
P R or cardio pulmonary resuscitation <,,> and uh <,> this can be remembered
<,> by simple words <,> of A <,> B <,> and C

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#57:1:B>
By A <,> I mean airway <,> and B <,> is breathing <,> and C <,>
means circulation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#58:1:B>
Once I say A A <,> airway <,> means how to take care of the airway
<,,> and B <,> is breathing is the process or the method <,> by which we can
blow air into the individuals lungs <,> to give him life <,> and C is the
circulation <,> that the technique by which <,> we can revive the heart which
has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital
top parts of the body <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#59:1:B>
This is what I meant by A <,> B <,> and C <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#60:1:B>
Now how to <,> do this technique <,> of A B and C <,> <w> we'll
</w> learn in a step wise fashion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#61:1:B>
The first and the foremost <,,> A means <,,> care of the airway
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#62:1:B>
Our aim is <,,> to keep this windpipe which you have already seen
<,> in that model <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#63:1:B>
But we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#64:1:B>
So we have to keep the <w> victim's </w> position <,> in that
fashion <,> so that the windpipe <,> is absolutely patent <,,> and we can do
so <,> by <,> chin lift <,> or head tilt position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#65:1:B>
Means we can give this you have to elevate the chin <,> and just
<,> you have to press back the forehead of the individual <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#66:1:B>
By doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the
wind pipe becomes absolutely patent <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#67:1:B>
This is what I mean by A

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#68:1:B>
It is very very simple <,> anybody can learn it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#69:1:B>
And just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be
saved <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#70:1:B>
<w> It's </w> such a simple technique <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#71:1:B>
And after doing so if you find <,> there are any signs of <,>
breathing <,> or any signs of circulation <,> then we are not to worry much
about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#72:1:B>
And if you find <,> there are no signs of respirations <,> and
there is no signs of <,> uh circulation <,> we should start <,> with another
step of B <,> what we call as breathing <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#73:1:B>
Now this breathing <,,> can be <,,> uh learnt <,> in two ways <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#74:1:B>
Like uh <,> we can give either a mouth to mouth breathing <,> or a
mouth to nose breathing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#75:1:B>
And one should never feel shy <,,> that may be of a opposite sex
may be a male female may be young or a old individual

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#76:1:B>
Our aims and objective is only one <,> and that is <,> to save the
life <,> irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#77:1:B>
And this can be achieved by <,,> bringing our lips <,,> in front of
the <w> victim's </w> lips <,> and <,> make it a <,,> absolutely airtight
seal <,> so that <,> when we blow the air into the patient into the <w>
victim's </w> mouth <,> it goes straight away into the lungs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#78:1:B>
And we must ensure before doing so that we <,> keep the <w>
individual's </w> position in the chin lift and the head tilt position <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#79:1:B>
And the second thing is <,> whenever we blow air <,,> into the <w>
individual's </w> mouth <,> we must clinch at the nostrils <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#80:1:B>
If we do not do so <,> then whatever air is blown <,> into the <w>
individual's </w> mouth <,> will leak out from the nose and we will not
achieve the goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#81:1:B>
<w> It's </w> very very important and simultanously we must watch
for the chest movements <,,> that is our technique or procedure <,> of giving
the air is alright <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#82:1:B>
And if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements <,,>
or there is some leakage of air <,> either from the sides of the lips <,> or
from the nostrils <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#83:1:B>
And this can be done <,> suppose for example if I am alone <,,>
there is only one rescuer <,> instead of two <,,> then we have to give a
mouth to mouth breathing by <,> chin lift head tilt position <,> clinch the
nostrils <,> and bring your mouth <,,> so you have to give <,> sudden <,,>
short <,,> blow of breath <,,> into the <w> individual's </w> or <w> victim's
</w> mouth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#84:1:B>
For example if there is a fracture <,> or there is a bleeding from
the mouth <,> or there is a vomitous <,> or there is some foul smelling
coming from the mouth then you can start with <,> mouth to nostril breathing
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#85:1:B>
And our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to
keep <,,> the <w> individual's </w> position in the same fashion <,> chin
lift <,> and head tilt position <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#86:1:B>
And we have to see that the mouth is closed <,,> when we give a <,>
mouth to nostril breathing like this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#87:1:B>
Once you do so we must always watch <,> for the chest movements
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#88:1:B>
If our technique is right <,> the chest will move <,> and we will
be sure that we have given the blow or breath <,> exactly into the wind-pipe

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#89:1:B>
<w> That's </w> how the lungs expanded <,> and the chest moved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#90:1:B>
Once you do so <,> and we find there are still no sings of
breathing there are no signs of uh <,> circulation <,> we start with C <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#91:1:B>
By C I mean circulation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#92:1:B>
Now how to achieve the circulation

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#93:1:B>
The technique is very very simple <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#94:1:B>
Like for example you can use your middle finger <,> and the index
finger <,> you can keep it <,> exactly in the centre of the lower chest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#95:1:B>
There is a notch here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#96:1:B>
If you see here carefully <,,> that is a notch <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#97:1:B>
Here the two halves of the <,,> two halves of the chest <,,> bony
cage they meet

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#98:1:B>
This is the notch <,,> here you have to keep your fingers <,,> the
index finger <,> and the middle finger <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#99:1:B>
Bring the palm of the other hand <,> and keep it over the breast
bone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#100:1:B>
Remove this hand <,> and put it over the <,,> other hand and
interlock it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#101:1:B>
And you have to make sure <,,> that you give this procedure of
what we call as <,,> heart massage <,,> or what we call as compressions over
the heart <,> to revive it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#102:1:B>
You have to see that you just lie absolutely in a <,> straight
position <,> you do not bend your elbow joints <,,> and you give enough
pressure <,> so that <,> there is a compression <,,> of about half inch <,>
to one and a half inch <,,> just indepth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#103:1:B>
We should not go <,> beyond that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#104:1:B>
And you can start giving compression

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#105:1:B>
Like for example <,> you can give compressions like this <,,> one
thosand one <,> one thousand two <,> one thousand three <,> one thousand four
<,> one thousand five <,> one thousand six <,> one thousand seven <,> one
thousand eight <,> one thousand nine <,> one thousand ten <,> one thousand
eleven <,> one thousand twelve <,> one thousand thirteen <,> one thousand
fourteen <,> one thousand fifteen <,> and after doing so <,> straight away
start the same position <,> chin lift head tilt position <,> clinch the nose
<,> and give mouth to mouth breathing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#106:1:B>
Then continue this procedure <,,> till <,> you see the signs of
life <,,> in the form of respiration or in the form of uh <,> uh circulation
achieved <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#107:1:B>
If you find that still no signs of respirations <,> we must
continue the technique <,> till we feel the <,> carotids artery here main
artery here <,> or we see some sort of breathing <,> and the <.> pa </.> or
<,> some sort of regaining of consciousness

<ICE-IND:S2A-059#108:1:B>
If it is not there <,> we have to continue it there are certain
things which we have to keep in mind <,,> when we do this technique of what
we call as a close cardiac massage <,,> or a compression <,> </I>
