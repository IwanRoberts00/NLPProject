<it> Has road traffic in the Orange City gone haywire?

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#4:1>
Several citizens appear to feel so.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#5:1>
A top Geological Survey of India official has prohibited his
teenaged daughter from driving her moped after 5 p.m.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#6:1>
He fears she may end up having and accident.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#8:1>
A company Director in the nearby MIDC Industrial Area says a short
prayer each time his working wife sets off to office on a Luna.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#9:1>
<quote> " She could get knocked down," </quote> he admits dryly.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#10:1>
<quote> " Watch out for trucks," </quote> Veena cautions her
school-going son, each morning.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#11:1>
If he isn't home in time, <w> she's </w> a bundle of nerves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#12:1>
In some cases it could be pure paranoia.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#13:1>
But the feeling of fear that has gripped a majority of road users
is genuine.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#14:1>
An octogenarian professor in the once quiet Laxminagar area has
abandoned his evening walk.

Ajit, a retired railway officer residing in Ram Nagar admits he
lost his nerve on several occasions while trying to get past the busy
Shankarnagar Square.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#18:1>
Five times out of ten, he has turned his bicycle homewards.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#19:1>
When he is forced to go beyond, he looks out for quiet inside lanes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#20:1>
<quote> " The traffic and the signals have become too much for me,"
</quote> he laments. </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#21:1>
For the young and the not so old, however, negotiating heavy
traffic has now become a matter of routine.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#22:1>
Heroes on their Hondas, Suzukis and <}> <-> kawasakis </-> <+>
Kawasakis </+> </}> , manoeuvre their way past all major intersections quite
easily and expertly.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#23:1>
So what if they flay a law or two?

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#24:1>
Can traffic cops catch up with their high-speed bikes? Then, <w>
there's </w> also the coolest class of road-users: the cycle rickshaw
pullers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#25:1>
Slowly and steadily, they trudge on, unmindful of the traffic they
may be holding up.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#26:1>
Giving them company is the cyclist, who pedals on as if traffic
signals and road laws didn't exist.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#27:1>
The less said about pedestrians the better.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#28:1>
For they can flit past all barriers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#29:1>
Truck drivers have been tamed to a great extent.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#30:1>
But the spill-over of light and medium vehicles continues to worry
citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#31:1>
They insist the traffic scenario is worsening each day.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#32:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> hard to say whether <w> I'll </w> get back
from office in one piece," </quote> says the scooter-borne medical
representative of a leading pharmaceutical firm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#33:1>
To illustrate their argument, citizens point to traffic snarl-ups
at major squares, smashed road dividers on Gokulpeth Market road, the jams at
variety and Medical squares, the massive truck traffic on Wardha Road and the
<quote> 'humped backbreakers' </quote> set up on various roads.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#34:1>
They then allege that the entire system has slipped beyond the
control of the city police. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#35:1>
In order to get the true picture and set the record straight,
<quote> " The Hitavada" </quote> spoke to Commissioner of Police S.M.
Pathania recently.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#36:1>
The issues that figured in the informal chat included: road mishaps,
the mushrooming traffic, street-lighting, road conditions, speed breakers,
runaway drivers, an evaluation of the traffic system and, of course, the
<w> citizens' </w> fears. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#37:1>
While admitting there was a tremendous increase in the number
of vehicles plying on the city roads, the police Chief vehemently denied
suggestions that the traffic system was in utter chaos.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#38:1>
In fact, he emphasised that things had improved considerably
ever since his department implemented new measures to streamline traffic.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#39:1>
Talking about the movement of the number one killers - - trucks -
- he pointed out that the entry of heavy vehicles into the city is being
regulated and monitored very carefully.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#40:1>
To ensure heavy vehicles don't run amuck patrolling by and posting of
a well equipped police force has been intensified along all major truck
zones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#41:1>
Almost two <indig> lakh </indig> vehicles ply on city roads on a
daily basis, he said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#42:1>
To cope up with this increased traffic and regulate its flow, the
police has taken several measures which include modernisation of the system
and the revamping of the outdated ones.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#43:1>
But all this can't be implemented overnight.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#44:1>
But an improvement is discernible, he pointed out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#45:1>
Quoting figures, the suave and soft-spoken top cop said the
fatality count on account of road mishaps was on the decline since the new
regulations were implemented last month.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#46:1>
Two wheelers, he said, were among the vehicles with the highest
casualty rate.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#47:1>
To expect a zero accident rate would be unfair in any place where
vehicles ply. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#48:1>
Asked about the new measures his department has in mind, the
police chief couldn't help having a go at cycle rickshaw pullers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#49:1>
It <}> <-> become </-> <+> became </+> </}> apparent that in his
scheme of things, these slow-paced three wheelers were more of a liability
than an asset.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#50:1>
Besides occupying too much road space, these vehicles account for
several traffic problems.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#51:1>
There were 5, 500 registered cycle rickshaws in the city besides the
unregistered ones.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#52:1>
He wondered how people could use such a slow mode of transport.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#53:1>
But he declined to say whether he had plans to have the rickshaws
banished from the <w> city's </w> roads.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#54:1>
This is one of the problems which is being studied by his
department in depth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#55:1>
WHEN it was pointed out that citizens were forced to opt for
rickshaws as <indig> autowallahs </indig> ask for exorbitant fares, the
police chief shook his head in exasperation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#56:1>
<quote> " If the auto drivers aren't plying by the meter why don't
people report the matter to us.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#57:1>
<w> It's </w> the people who are to blame for this continuing
menace," </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#58:1>
Asked how his department planned to reign in speed freaks who are
known to bypass the traffic lights and cops, the police chief said his men
posted at high-traffic squares were equipped with sophisticated
walkie-talkies to counter this menace.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#59:1>
If the speedster escapes at one square, <w> he'll </w> be caught at
the next.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#60:1>
( <w> that's </w> , provided he goes by the next square!) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#61:1>
He also had it his department plans to procure more communication
equipment so that traffic cops stay well posted.

In case of an emergency, the police sub inspectors in charge of
the road traffic are equipped with motor bikes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#66:1>
They would not hesitate to give traffic offenders a chase.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#67:1>
( <}> <-> at </-> <+> At </+> </}> the moment, the <quote> 'chase'
</quote> is confined mostly to trucks.)

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#68:1>
The introduction of the new type of speed-breakers called <quote> 'humps'
</quote> , he said, had gone a long way in cutting down the speed of even the
most daring driver.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#69:1>
The Police Chief did not agree with the suggestion that these types
of <quote> 'breakers' </quote> were causing more accidents than preventing
them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#70:1>
It is the latest in traffic control technology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#71:1>
The earlier variety of speedbreakers called <quote> 'rumblers'
</quote> , it was found, were not very effective.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#72:1>
Heavy vehicles could cruise over them without slowing down.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#73:1>
Besides, signs have been put up before each <quote> 'hump' </quote>
to ensure road users don't miss them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#74:1>
And what about the natural speed breakers that the Nagpur
Municipal Corporation and other authorities dig up from time to time? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#75:1>
The police chief was diplomatic when he answered this one.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#76:1>
The civic authorities are doing their best.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#77:1>
And we are getting full cooperation from various other authorities.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#78:1>
They have also been requested to take up the lighting up of important
streets on a priority basis.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#79:1>
The process is already on in most areas, he said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#80:1>
On how he plans to deal with heavy traffic at major squares, the
police chief said, in order to ensure a smooth flow most of the traffic
circles will have to be scrapped in future.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#81:1>
This is to make sure traffic from all sides gets all the space it
needs to proceed smoothly.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#82:1>
Part two is widening of roads. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#83:1>
He also discussed the road widening plan would start at Wardha
Road.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#84:1>
This, he also said, had been necessitated as most footpaths were
fast disappearing and pedestrians were spilling on the roads.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#85:1>
There was also a proposal to make the Sadar road on way during peak
hours so that school going kids were not exposed to traffic hazards.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#86:1>
Police Chief <w> Pathania's </w> departments also plans to introduce
a lane system at all major squares to avoid confusion when the green light
goes on.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#87:1>
This system is in vogue at Bombay and other metropolitan cities.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#88:1>
With the squares scrapped this system should ensure that distribution
of ongoing traffic is not hindered, he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#89:1>
In reply to a query from a <quote> 'Hitavada' </quote> reader,
<quote> 'roadster' </quote> that registration of all new vehicles be
banned so that traffic could be controlled more systematically, the Police
Chief declined that his department had any such plan in mind.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#90:1>
He also denied the suggestion that Nagpur roads could not take on any
more vehicles.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#91:1>
What is required is traffic regulation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#92:1>
In the very near future things are going to change rapidly.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#93:1>
There is already a marked improvement.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#94:1>
What is needed is a change in traffic attitudes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#95:1>
The people here are attuning themselves to the system.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#96:1>
With a little more cooperation from the citizens the system could
change for the better, the Police Chief also said. </p> </I>

<h> Lendl to meet Edberg in final </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#98:2>
<@PR> MELBOURNE {#}, <@DR> Jan. 27 {#} ( <@SR> AP {#}):
- - Ivan Lendl wielded his racket like a machine gun from the baseline
and Stefan Edberg attacked at the net as they set up a clash in the
Australian Opens finals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#99:2>
In swift executions by different methods, defending champion
Lendl and two-time former champion Edberg performed almost flawlessly in two
of the most one-sided Grand Slam semifinals since the Open era began in 1968.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#100:2>
Lendl passed Yannick Noah left and right when the frustrated
Frenchman charged the net, and outdueled him from the baseline when Noah
stayed back to win 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 in one hour, 47 minutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#101:2>
Edberg handed sluggish fellow Swede Mats Wilander the worst
defeat in his 155 Grand Slam matches, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#102:2>
Edberg simply had too many weapons for Wilander and put him away
with merciful quickness in one hour, 22 minutes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#103:2>
There was a fraction of a second in <w> Noah's </w> victory over
Lendl two weeks ago when Noah leaped for a volley and hung horizontally in
midair. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#104:2>
His racked outstretched and his dreadlocks flying, Noah poked
the ball over the net and won the point. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#105:2>
Noah, the rejuvenated 29-year old Frenchman, needed all of that
acrobatic effort, and more, to beat Lendl again Friday, but he couldn't
come up with it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#106:2>
The victory two weeks ago came in a tune up in Sydney.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#107:2>
This was for the finals of a Grand Slam, and the No. 1 Lendl is a
different player when the big money is on the line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#108:2>
In the 3-million-dollar Australian Open, the <w> men's </w>
winner gets 2,00,000 dollars, the runner-up 1,00,000 dollars and the
semifinalists 50,000 dollars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#109:2>
Noah held a 3-1 edge over Lendl on hard courts, and a 10-7 lead
in overall matches before the semifinal match. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#110:2>
Lendl expects to use the same strategy in the finals,
commandeering the baseline most of the time and coming to the net on occasion
to keep Edberg guessing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#111:2>
<quote> " Always when Stefan and I play, he will serve and
volley and I play defence" </quote> , Lendl said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#112:2>
<X> <quote> " I will try to fend him off.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#X113:2>
It depends on how much impression I make on his serve.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#X114:2>
If he holds at love or 15, he can take chances on my serve"
</quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#115:2>
Lendl, a Czech who lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, clicked on
67 per cent of his first serves, drilled 36 winners past Noah and cut down on
errors as the match progressed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#116:2>
After making 20 errors in the first set, Lendl hit only eight in
the second set and six in the third. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#117:2>
Lendl, never broken in the three sets, broke Noah in the first
game of the match and the last, and four times in between. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#118:2>
<quote> " He was overpowering me from the baseline" </quote>
, said Noah, who made only 50 per cent of his first serves.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#119:2>
<X> <quote> " I wasn't moving as well as I wanted to if I wanted to
beat him.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#X120:2>
I was too far ( behind) the baseline and it was a long way to get
into the net.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#X121:2>
In the end, I was a little flat, and he was playing really well"
</quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#122:2>
If Lendl didn't play quite as perfectly as Edberg, he played
well enough to satisfy himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#123:2>
<quote> " I had one of those days where I almost played perfect
tennis" </quote> , Edberg said.

<X> <quote> " I think I played as well as I could.

<ICE-IND:W2C-016#X125:2>

I had great timing on my serves" </quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-016#127:2>
Edberg, the third seed, got in 80 per cent of his serves and put
