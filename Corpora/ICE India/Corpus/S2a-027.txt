<I> 
 
<$A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#1:1:A>
I prepared it just <,> uh in case we need to <,,> refer to  
something <,> common which we have <,,> in our hand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#2:1:A>
Uh <,,> and <w> I'll </w> keep the <,> tone of this talk uh quite  
informal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#3:1:A>
So <,> in case you want to <,,> sort of place some questions <,,>  
uhm <,,> <w> it's </w> better to postpone them till the end of the talk 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#4:1:A>
But uh <,,> in case you feel that uh <,,> you have a very strong  
impulse to ask something you can stop me you know <,,> and you know sort of  
uh <,,> there is no problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#5:1:A>
Well <w> I've </w> termed this <,,> the the title of this as <,>  
<mention> Language in Poetry </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#6:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very <,,> uh <,,> very often we talk of language of  
poetry <,,> or the poetic language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#7:1:A>
And uh <,,> I think <,,> there are two ways of looking at it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#8:1:A>
One is the <,,> what we call the <,,> classical <,,> traditional <,>  
approach to <,> poetic language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#9:1:A>
That there is a <-> special </-> <,> specially marked <,> group of  
words <,,> which are <,> highly poetic in nature <,> the classical and the  
neo- classical <,,> way of writing poems <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#10:1:A>
Uh <,> this is exemplified <,> in my first example <,,> the notion  
of poetic diction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#11:1:A>
Uh you must have heard of <,,> Banabhatt <,,> the seventh century  
<,,> Sanskrit writer <,,> the writer of <,,> the <,,> piece <,,> called  
<mention> Kadambari </mention> <,> the first <,,> formal narrative <,,> uh  
very elaborate narrative in Sanskrit <,> in prose <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#12:1:A>
The <,> supreme example of <,> classical <,,> prose style <O> cough  
</O> in Sanskrit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#13:1:A>
<w> It's </w> also the supreme example of what an ornamental style  
is like <,,> ornamental prose style <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#14:1:A>
And it is said <,> what I want to illustrate <,,> uh to this is <,>  
you see <,,> this work was <,> incomplete there is a myth about uh <,> this  
work called <mention> Kadambari </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#15:1:A>
The work was incomplete when he was <,> about to die <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#16:1:A>
He called to one of his <,> <indig> shisyas </indig> <,,> and also  
<,> his <,> son was there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#17:1:A>
Uh just to test <,> who would <,,> who <,> who would be able to  
complete the work in case he is not able to complete <,> and then <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#18:1:A>
And he you know <,,> he pointed to a withered tree <,,> and uh <,>  
asked <,> what is it <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#19:1:A>
And I have <,,> given the two responses one of <w> Bana's </w> <,>  
disciple <,> who said <indig> shusko vrikshaha <,> tishthati agre <,,> agre  
</indig> in front of us <,> <indig> agre <,,> shuskai </indig> dried up  
withered <,> <indig> vriksha </indig> is tree <,> <indig> tishathati </indig>  
is standing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#20:1:A>
Now <,> Bana asked his son <,,> what about you <,> what is that <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#21:1:A>
And he said <,> <indig> neeras <,> taruhu iha vilasati puratha  
purataha </indig> is again <,,> uh uh <w> that's </w> almost the same as  
<indig> agre </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#22:1:A>
Okay <,> but <,,> uh it is <,> more poetic to say <quote> <indig>  
purataha </indig> than to say <indig> agre </indig> </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#23:1:A>
It <,> highly prosaic to say <indig> agre <,> vilasati </quote>  
</indig> instead of <indig> tishathati </indig> <,,> uh you have heard of the  
word <indig> vilas </indig> where <,> you can you know <,> <indig> vilasati  
</indig> in that sense <,> <indig> taruhu </indig> instead of <indig>  
vrikshaha <,> iha </indig> is uh <,,> <indig> neeras </indig> instead of  
<indig> shuska </indig> <,> it is <indig> neeras </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#24:1:A>
So these are some of the <,,> dimension of <,,> a <,,> poetic <,>  
diction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#25:1:A>
Modern poets and modern critic <,> uh particularly post nineteenth  
century post symbolist <,> don't believe in this approach at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#26:1:A>
In fact modern poetry has revolted against <,> this kind of thing  
in fact <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#27:1:A>
The the revolt began <-> with </-> <,> in the West with the  
nineteenth century romantic poets <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#28:1:A>
Wordsworth <,> wanted to write <,> the language of men <,,> okay  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#29:1:A>
The <,> the common <,> commonly used language not <,> the specially  
used <,> specially concocted <,> poetical diction <,> or poetic diction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#30:1:A>
But <,> what it <,> it uh <,> does <,> perhaps this kind of an  
approach is to draw your attention to <,,> draw our attention to <,> the  
element of choice involved in all <,,> poetry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#31:1:A>
The element of choice in diction <,> that is in vocabulary <,>  
element of choice involved in structures <,> their arrangements <,> choice of  
metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice <,> and it is a choice  
<,> in language 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#32:1:A>
And that is why I say <quote> It is <,> language in poetry </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#33:1:A>
You have to <,> uh uh <,> poetry happens in language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#34:1:A>
See again the traditional view that <,> language is the <,,> dress  
<,> is the ornament <,> for content is the soul <,> is quite misleading <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#35:1:A>
Even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know <,>  
language and thought language and content are <,> organically related 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#36:1:A>
Even without going into <,> that kind of an extreme position we can  
still say that poetry is something which happens <,> in language <O> cough  
</O> which emerges <,> out of language you can't think of poetry <,> without  
thinking of language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#37:1:A>
You can't say that poetry <,> uh somehow exist somewhere outside  
language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#38:1:A>
This language which limits it as <?> Wilkin Cine </?> had said <,>  
uh the limits of <,,> our language are the limits of our experience <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#39:1:A>
In that sense the limits of our language are the limits of <,,> uh  
poetry which get written in that language <,> in a sense <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#40:1:A>
But it is only uh metaphor I am using because <,> those limits are  
extendable those limits are <,> in fact being <,> uhm uh changed and shifted  
<,> by the poets themselves <,,> okay 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#41:1:A>
So this is <,> uh my first point uh <,> that it <,,> there is <,>  
we need not think in terms of false dichotomies <,> like language <,> Vs  
literature most students and <,> teachers of literature are <,,> uh tend to  
look at it in uh <,> in that particular fashion 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#42:1:A>
Language Vs literature I think <w> it's </w> a <,> <w> it's </w>  
absolutely a false dichotomy this is <w> it's </w> a false opposition <,,>  
popularized by those who were <,> uh well who who don't want to make the  
necessary effort to you know <,> uh uhm <,> look at <,> the language of  
poetry <,> carefully <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#43:1:A>
Uh <,> so one of the most <,> fascinating aspects of reading and  
studying <,> literature and poetry to explore its relation to language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#44:1:A>
Now <,,> what I want to now look at is <,,> see <,,> in the  
twentieth century <,,> the Swiss linguist <,> Ferdinand Sassuare <,,> first  
<,,> gave us <,> this particular notion <,,> that language is a system of  
sign 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#45:1:A>
The first <,> semiotic <,> motion <,,> okay <,> which has shaken  
the intellectual world <,> which has shaped it in a new way many many  
different disciplines <,> including <,> anthropology including <,> sociology  
including <,> psychology <,> structuralism and semiotics have <,,> played <,>  
a crucial role <,,> in literature <,> in <,,> language <,> certainly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#46:1:A>
Now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what  
are the implications of this <,,> okay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#47:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a semiot to to give language as a semiotic system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#48:1:A>
Uh let me tell you that <,,> Sassuare <,> though he was the first  
twentieth century linguist <,,> in the West to look at language in this  
particular fashion <,,> language as a system <,,> <.> bu </.> and emphasis  
the systemic <,> systemic aspect of language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#49:1:A>
Uh <,,> this approach <,,> in classical times <,> uh <,,> goes back  
to say <,,> Panini <,,> okay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#50:1:A>
The whole theory of Sanskrit grammar <,,> which Panini developed  
<,> has <,,> it has been called structuralist it has been called generative 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#51:1:A>
Now <,,> apart from those <,> terms I am not <,> going to elaborate  
those terms but certainly language and its structure <,,> have fascinated  
people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#52:1:A>
People have <,> had <,> a lot of <,> theories about it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#53:1:A>
We shall selectively use <,> a part of that theory <,,> in order to  
see how <,,> what happens to language in poetry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#54:1:A>
Just as we see <,> what happens <,> how poetry happens in language  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#55:1:A>
I want to see <,> how <,> what happens to language in poetry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#56:1:A>
And this can be seen at <,> four levels <,,> four basic levels of  
linguistic structuring <,> which linguists have identified <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#57:1:A>
Language <,,> for a linguist is essentially <,> spoken <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#58:1:A>
So <,> it is <O> cough </O> phonological <,> as they call <,>  
phonological 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#59:1:A>
Phonology is the study of <,> the systems of sounds <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#60:1:A>
Languages <,> select certain sounds <,> arbitraly <,,> and start  
<,> organizing them in certain systematic way <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#61:1:A>
There are infinite number of sounds which a human <,,> vocal  
organism can produce <,,> in itself as you can see from a child babling <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#62:1:A>
All kinds of sounds <,> are produced <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#63:1:A>
But certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds  
<,,> and <,> are structured <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#64:1:A>
So this is called the phonological level of structuring <,,>  
linguistic structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#65:1:A>
These sounds come together to form certain level <,,> of <,> higher  
abstractions that is <,,> you can have a syllable <,,> and you can have  
certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#66:1:A>
So vowels <,> consonants and <,> higher levels of organizations  
into syllables <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#67:1:A>
This is <,,> one level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#68:1:A>
Further <,> you develop into <,,> the level of <,,> word word which  
is called morphology <,,> word and formation of words <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#69:1:A>
A still higher level <,> of organization by higher I mean <,>  
larger and larger units <,> of organization is the syntactic level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#70:1:A>
And <,,> through syntax you <,> communicate meaning the meanings  
are also <,> structured in language 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#71:1:A>
So Sassuare was trying to <,,> explore the nature of the linguistic  
sign <,> which on the one hand relates <,> certain sounds <,> to certain  
words <,> uh to certain meanings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#72:1:A>
So sounds on the one hand <,> meanings on the other what Sassuare  
called <,> a relation between the signifier <,> and the signified <,> the  
sounds and images <,> sounds and meanings <,> etcetera 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#73:1:A>
And these four levels of structuring <,,> what Sassuare developed  
<,> and what modern linguistics has developed is <,,> a certain way of  
describing <,,> the structure of a language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#74:1:A>
Describing the norm which governs language behaviour <,> ordinary  
<,> linguistic behaviour <,> ordinary speech behaviour <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#75:1:A>
What are the rules <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#76:1:A>
Okay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#77:1:A>
This is <,> what lead us to <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#78:1:A>
Now obviously when you have a rule <,,> there is also <,,> a  
possibility of breaking that rule <,,> of deviating from the rule <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#79:1:A>
And <,,> to begin with I would say that poetry <,> is some kind of  
a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage <,> from the normal <,> usage  
you deviate <,> purposefully <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#80:1:A>
Now I don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on  
<,> on the <.> poe </.> <,> on the part of the poet 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#81:1:A>
I don't want to go into the <w> poet's </w> psychy to ask the  
questions <,> what did this poet actually mean when when he wrote this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#82:1:A>
For me it is enough if we can <,> reconstruct some kind of a poet  
within the poem <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#83:1:A>
<w> That's </w> enough for me I don't have to <,> go and verify  
from the poet did you mean really this <,> or something else <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#84:1:A>
<w> That's </w> not <,,> <w> that's </w> not my approach <,> <w>  
that's </w> may be a relevant approach for a psycho-analyst <,,> for a  
biographer <,,> but not for <,> say <,> a literary critic <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#85:1:A>
A literary critic would be interested in <,> the text <,,> how text  
<,,> uh become <,,> in the texuality of the text <,,> okay <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#86:1:A>
How these text <,> <-> makes </-> <,,> construct meaning <,,> with  
the help of whatever norm <,> if that is available with the help of <O> one  
word </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#87:1:A>
So <,> <w> that's </w> why I put in <,> norm and deviation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#88:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> come to examples a little later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#89:1:A>
Let me go on to the third point in my <,> synopsis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#90:1:A>
Modern linguistics has not stop at the <,,> consideration <,> of  
<,,> structure of language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#91:1:A>
It has also to say something about <,> the functions of language  
<,,> particularly uh <,> the European school of <,> analysis 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#92:1:A>
See the <,,> after Sassuare Sassuare was a Swiss linguist <,>  
writing in French <,,> around nineteen hundred and twelve <,> he delivered  
between nineteen nine <,> and nineteen twelve <,> he delivered a series of  
lectures which have <,> now come to the uh <,> come to be recognized as  
revolutionary lectures in the form of a course <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#93:1:A>
They were published as <,> a book <,,> uh Sassuare never intended  
to write it as a book but <,,> uh lecture notes were <,,> uh expanded and  
published in the form of a book <mention> Course in General Linguistics  
</mention> by students <,> and it has <,> shaped our notions of language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#94:1:A>
Uh though Sassuare didn't write anything about literature <,,> his  
views of language have been <,,> same as very crucial in our dealing with <,>  
poetic language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#95:1:A>
One <,> at the structural level <,,> the American linguist <-> took  
over <,> took <,> </-> took off from that point and developed theories of  
structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#96:1:A>
One whole school came into being called American structuralism lead  
by Leonard Brumfield <,,> uh culminated in the work of <,> Charles Hawkins  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#97:1:A>
After that <,> there was again <,> a a reaction against that and  
<,> uh from M I T Chomsky has been developing his theory of Generative  
Grammar <,,> nineteen fifty-seven onwards <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#98:1:A>
So this has been the line of printing <,> the generative grammar  
the structuralist grammar <,,> in the field of <,,> description of linguistic  
structure <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#99:1:A>
The other line was followed by the European linguists <,,>  
particularly <,> linguists of the France school <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#100:1:A>
And there is one linguist who <,> who has remained the link  
between language <,> literature <,> European tradition American tradition and  
has sort of you know <,> uh has been able to combine the various <,,> uh  
traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western  
tradition of linguistics <,,> uh symbolized by Roman Jocobson <,> the work of  
Roman Jacobson <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#101:1:A>
Uh <,,> who was part of the Russian formalists <,,> part of the  
France school <,,> part of the <,> uh American scene after the sixties <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#102:1:A>
And <,,> the functions that I have enumerated <,,> uh have been  
proposed by Jacobson <,> very simply <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#103:1:A>
Again there is <,,> a specially poetic function which he  
identified but <,,> these are not functions which are mutually exclusive <,>  
every speech act <,> for the linguists of France school for <,,> Roman  
Jacobson <,,> has <,> six different directions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#104:1:A>
It can have these potentially it has the six different elements  
and these <,> six different directions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#105:1:A>
They are sort of orientations of the speech act <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#106:1:A>
One is <,> you can <,,> you can say <quote> I am very unhappy  
</quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#107:1:A>
This is <,> self-expression <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#108:1:A>
The speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself <,> and  
trying to tell people <,> what is happening to him or her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#109:1:A>
This is called the expressive function of language 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#110:1:A>
Please notice <,,> that unlike <,> the romantic or the expressive  
theories in the West Jacobson does not equate <,> this kind of  
self-expression with the poetic <,> language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#111:1:A>
Language of poetry is not language of self- expression <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#112:1:A>
Second <,,> you can orient it to the receiver of your message <,>  
in a poetic act <,,> you can say <quote> please open the door </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#113:1:A>
I am not expressing <,> my feelings about it I am simply <,,>  
persuading you requesting you <,> trying to influence you to do something <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#114:1:A>
This can be called connotive <,> or <,,> uh emotive persuasive <,>  
use of language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#115:1:A>
This is an orientation and please notice that <,,> poetry <,> can  
be expressive <,,> but that is not its central function 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#116:1:A>
Poetry can be emotive <,> persuasive <,> for example take  
patriotic poetry can be vey <,> highly emotive and persuasive but <w> that's  
</w> not its function according to Jacobson <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#117:1:A>
The third is I can straight refer to the environment because there  
is a context to our <,,> entire <,,> uh speech act <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#118:1:A>
And I can say well uh <,> <quote> <w> It's </w> rather hot today  
</quote> <,> which <,> serves <,,> to refer to an internal or external factor  
in the communicative act 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#119:1:A>
This can be called a referential function of language 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#120:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> describe it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#121:1:A>
Referring to something specific <,> in the environment in the  
context of the speech act <,,> this is called the <,,> uh referential  
function or the <}> <-> <.> des </.> </-> <=> descriptive </=> </}> function  
of language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-027#122:1:A>
