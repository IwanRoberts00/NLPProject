<ICE-IND:S2A-062#1:1:A>
As in the session <@> Ex Ex Ex </@> is concerned <,,> against
the accused number one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#2:1:A>
The Prosecution has <,,> miserably failed to establish the charge
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#3:1:A>
P W one <,,> <@> Kadu Achari </@> <,,> in his uh <,> evidence says
<,,> that <,,> I picked up a stone <,,> which was <,,> which which <,> hit
the <,> rear side of the accused shoulder <,,> and the accused sat down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#4:1:A>
This statement <,,> this very version of the evidence <,> has been
contradicted repeatedly <,> not twice but repeatedly <,> by P W three <,> and
P W one himself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#5:1:A>
According to the <,> P W one <,> he picked up one stone <,> and that
hit <,,> that <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#6:1:A>
According to P W three <,> the P W one has picked up two stones <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#7:1:A>
This is the contradiction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#8:1:A>
Now <,,> the P W <,> one <,> P W three says <,> the accused number
one was at <,> distance of at about twenty feet <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-062#9:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-062#10:1:A>
And above all Your Honour <,,> P W one himself does not say
<,,> that <,> he was assaulted by <@> N H S </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#11:1:A>
Your Honour will see page number five <,> paga page number five <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#12:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#13:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <w> I'm </w> coming to the cross examination <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#14:1:A>
Before cross examination <,,> <w> I'm </w> coming to the cross
examination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#15:1:A>
Before cross examination <,> let us see what the <,> P W one has
said <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#16:1:A>
He had stated <,> in examination you see

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#17:1:A>
<&> interruption </&> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#18:1:A>
Sir here are the contradiction which I want to point out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#19:1:A>
In this examination you see <,> at page number six <,,> P W one
says <,,> <quote> I picked up a stone <,,> and threw it at that <@> N H S
</@> <,,> which hit him on the rear <,> on the rear side of his left shoulder
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#20:1:A>
Thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and <.>
assault </.> started assaulting me </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#21:1:A>
He does not say <,,> the effect of <,> throwing and hitting with a
stone <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#22:1:A>
He does not say anything <,> that the accused sat down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#23:1:A>
He says <quote> all the accused surrounded me and <,,> started
assaulting me </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#24:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#25:1:A>
No no what he says against <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#26:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#27:1:A>
No I have to <,> I am pointing out from the P W one himself <,,>
that he does not say <,,> as the latter said he does not say that <@> N H S
</@> has assaulted me <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#28:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#29:1:A>
No no contradiction not in that sense <w> I'm </w> talking <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#30:1:A>
Contradiction so far as his <.> sta </.> his own statement is
concerned <,> uh his own <,> evidence is concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#31:1:A>
Contradiction not between the statement and the evidence <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#32:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#33:1:A>
There were inconsistency <,,> between the <.> e </.> <,> between
the evidence of P W three <,> and the examination in D <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#34:1:A>
I realized in the cross examination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#35:1:A>
Now here he says <,,> <quote> I picked up <,> a stone <,,> I threw
it <,> it hit <,> the rear side <}> <-> of <.> sh </.> </-> <=> of shoulder
</=> </}> of the <@> N H S </@> </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#36:1:A>
He does not say <,> that he sat down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#37:1:A>
He says <,> <quote> then all of them surrounded me and started
assaulting me </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#38:1:A>
Now Your Honour <,,> Your Honour thereafter <,> P W <,> one <,>
further goes on saying <,> <quote> they surrounded me <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#39:1:A>
They started assaulting me </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#40:1:A>
How <,> how <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#41:1:A>

<@> Big Umesh </@> assaulted me on the right thigh </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#43:1:A>
He does not say <@> N </@> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#44:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#45:1:A>
No no no <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#46:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#47:1:A>
Your Honour <w> I'm </w> not <,> on that angle <,> <w> I'm </w> not
on that angle <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#48:1:A>
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#49:1:A>
He says <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#50:1:A>
No Sir what he says that he was assaulted by <@> C D E and F </@>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#51:1:A>
He does not say he was assaulted by <@> N H S </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#52:1:A>
He says he was assaulted by Mr <@> C </@> <,> with <}> <-> this <.>
weap </.> </-> <=> this weapon </=> </}> <,> sickle <,,> <@> D </@> by sickle
again <@> D </@> by this weapon <,> and <@> E </@> by <,> last <@> E </@> by
<,,> nothing no weapon is there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#53:1:A>
So he does not implicate <,> <@> N H S </@> accused number one <,>
that he assaulted him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#54:1:A>
Page number six Your Honour top <,,> P W three <,> at page number
forty-six says <,,> that <,,> accused number one told the other assailants
<,> to assault him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#55:1:A>

Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#59:1:A>
Here I wanted to draw your attention <,,> on this <,,> this piece
piece of evidence <,> that he has not implicated the <@> N H S </@> so far as
any weapon is concerned <,> with which he was assaulted <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#60:1:A>
This <w> <@> Achari's </@> </w> statement <,> <&> interruption </&>

Thirty-four <,,> <&> interruption </&> Common intention <&>
interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#66:1:A>
Sir therefore Your Honour <,,> the common intention is to be proved
<,> uh <w> I'm </w> coming to that also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#67:1:A>
First of all <,> charge under section <,> three hundred <,> <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#68:1:A>
Not I want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the <,> piece
of evidences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#69:1:A>
Now here <,,> <&> interruption </&> uh at page Your Honour at page
number four <,> he says that accused number <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#70:1:A>
Page number five Your Honour Sir P W one says <,> <@> N H S </@>
was armed with <,> button knife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#71:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#72:1:A>
Where Your Honour <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#73:1:A>
Where Your Honour <,,> this is there is a lot of inconsistency with
<,,> in the evidence of the same person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#74:1:A>
Your Honour once approved <,> that the case which is defective
because of the infirmity of the evidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#75:1:A>
No then there is no point question of common intention Your Honour
<,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#76:1:A>
Here Your Honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he
says that I was having the <.> butto </.> he was having the <,> button knife
<,> and what he has stated <,> before P W seven came <,> that M G R was
having sickle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#77:1:A>
P W three says <@> N H S </@> was having sickle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#78:1:A>
Nobody says button knife <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#79:1:A>
No <w> I'm </w> connect <,> see <w> I'm </w> read it jointly <,>
connect <,,> jointly <,> connect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#80:1:A>
So that uh <,,> any <,> uh <,> any formal statement <,> can be made
before the court <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#81:1:A>
So Your Honour my submission is <,,> my submission is Your Honour
<,,> that <,,> the particular witness P W one <,,> has not stated any
previous evidence <,,> that he was assaulted by P W <,> uh

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#82:1:A>
He was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon <,,> <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#83:1:A>
No Your Honour Your Honour has corrected my word <,> can't I
instead of contradiction <,,> inconsistent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#84:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#85:1:A>
Aa at page number thirty-four Your Honour what P W <,> three says
about the stone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#86:1:A>
Your Honour if <,,> if that is so Your Honour then <,,> nothing
remains <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#87:1:A>
If the <,,> stone is hit to the accused <,,> then accused sat down
<,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#88:1:A>
I am a <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#89:1:A>
I am on the point <,,> there once that <&> interruption </&> <,> P
W one sustained injury he sat down <,,> if he sat down <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#90:1:A>
And if he sustained injury <,,> he cannot be expected to act <,>
actually <,,> to assault <,> the accused <.> num </.> of P W one <,,> is the
means <w> it's </w> this <,> <}> <-> <.> acc aa </.> </-> <=> accused </=>
</}> number one <,> would have suspect is accused number one would have been
<,> hit with that stone <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#91:1:A>
And his commission was that <,,> he sat down <,,> accused number
one according to the <,> evidence of <,> P W three <,> P W one <,> that he
sat down <,,> and thereafter <,> Your Honour he cannot be expected to act
actually <,> to assault someone to that extent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#92:1:A>
He could not bear even a stone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#93:1:A>
That was his health <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#94:1:A>
So Your Honour <,> Your Honour presuming the two days later as <&>
interruption </&> and sat down thereafter <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#95:1:A>

Thereafter they went away <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#97:1:A>
Your Honour according to P W three <,,> thereafter <,> accused
number one <,,> <}> <-> respected accused was </-> <=> rest of the accused
</=> </}> according to P W three were assault <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#98:1:A>
That means accused number one did not assault at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#99:1:A>
Para twenty Your Honour page number forty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#100:1:A>

He is talking about deceased <,,> <@> Iyengar </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#106:1:A>
I am talking about <@> Kadu Achari </@> <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#107:1:A>
I am coming <,,> to that <.> a </.> afterwards <,> finishing the
charge so far as <@> Kadu Achari </@> is concerned <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#108:1:A>
Yes uh I I was <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#109:1:A>
Yes <,> he says here <,> and thereafter she says <,,> <quote> I
<,,> I do not know <,> what weapons who was having </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#110:1:A>
She says that she doesn't know <,,> which accused was having <,>
which weapon <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#111:1:A>
No mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over <,> yes which
which arm <,> <&> interruption </&> no no assault assault with what <,,> ?
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#112:1:A>
The same witness <&> interruption </&> <,> number P W three
herself says <,,> at page number forty-five <,,> P W three says <,> I cannot
say <,> as to who was armed with which weapon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#113:1:A>
When she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was
assaulted in <,> in her <,> before her own eyes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#114:1:A>
She cannot see all <,> she cannot <&> interruption </&> she cannot
exactly say <,> who has assaulted <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#115:1:A>
She cannot exactly say who has assaulted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#116:1:A>
Just merely taking <w> somebody's </w> name <&> interruption </&>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#117:1:A>
Sir <,,> blood mark on the knife <,> though before <,> before the
court when you had pointed out the knife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#118:1:A>
He says <w> there's </w> <,> <w> there's </w> no blood mark on the
knife <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#119:1:A>
It was <,,> it was sealed in the wrapper <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#120:1:A>
It was sealed <,,> labelled <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#121:1:A>
If if <,> if at all the blood was there it should be there <,> <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#122:1:A>
No no it is <,> it is very risky to leave this type of evidence
Your Honour when she says at page number forty-five <quote> I cannot say who
was having what type of weapon </quote> <&> interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#123:1:A>
Then uh <,> it will be very hardship if the portion of the
evidence <,,> which goes in favour of the Prosecution is to be selected <,,>
and the evidence <,> the fortune of which something might even <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#124:1:A>
Yes there are contradictions Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#125:1:A>
Here I will point out the Supreme Court judgement <,> whenever
there are two versions <,> one goes in favour of the accused <,> one goes in
<.> fav </.> against the accused

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#126:1:A>
The version which goes in favour of the accused <,> or any version
chosen by the accused <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#127:1:A>
No no here <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#128:1:A>
They have what <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#129:1:A>
Yes Your Honour at page forty-five she says <quote> I cannot say
<,> what type of weapon who was having </quote> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#130:1:A>
Why should I put that he he was having this weapon <,,> <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#131:1:A>
Sir how can I suggest that I was having weapon <,,> I was not
having <,> knife I was having sickle can I suggest him <,,> <&> interruption
</&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#132:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#133:1:A>
At last line paragraph thirty-six she says <quote> I cannot say
as to </quote> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#134:1:A>
Cross examination <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#135:1:A>
Forty-six <,,> last line <,,> <quote> I cannot say as to who was
armed with which weapon </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#136:1:A>
So <,,> that <,> both the witnesses <,,> P W three and P W one
<,,> I have not established <,,> any particular weapon which I was having <,>
either sickle <,> or <,,> a a knife

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#137:1:A>
Therefore <,> the assumption is that I was not having any weapon
either sickle or knife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#138:1:A>
At page number thirty-four Your Honour <,,> the P W three says
<quote> <@> N H S </@> <,> and <@> Asami </@> told to kill my husband
</quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#139:1:A>
Here <,> here also Your Honour <,> told <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#140:1:A>
So Your Honour may say that there are <,> having common intention
<,> Your Honour here also <,> the <@> N H S </@> is inactive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#141:1:A>
He does not <,> inactive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#142:1:A>
<}> <-> He <.> doe </.> </-> <=> he does </=> </}> not act <,>
positively <,> by assaulting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#143:1:A>
After hitting with the stone <,,> <&> interruption </&> regarding
common intention <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#144:1:A>
Now Your Honour <&> interruption </&> no <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#145:1:A>
What I <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#146:1:A>
What I am trying to convince the court <,,> <w> there's </w> a
different <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#147:1:A>
No there are different versions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#148:1:A>
Your Honour <,> give me one minutes time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#149:1:A>
Your Honour <,,> so far as <,,> so far as <,,> uh I have come to
know that Your Honour was <,> lecturer also <,,> <}> <-> <.> yo </.> </-> <=>
Your </=> </}> Honour was a lecturer also <,> Your Honour knows law better
than I understand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#150:1:A>
In fact uh <,,> Sir I am <,> making my own submission <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#151:1:A>
Thereafter I will stop my argument <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#152:1:A>
Mr Sheikh will <,> argue and he will cover my client also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#153:1:A>
One submission Your Honour <,,> regarding <@> Ramna </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#154:1:A>

His statement was recorded by the police <,,> <&> interruption
</&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#156:1:A>
What recorded by the police <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-062#157:1:A>
He was not called <,> as a witness in the box <&> interruption
</&> <,>

Therefore Your Honour <,,> adverse inference made <?> pleasing
