<quote> " Way back in about 1960 I wrote that there were three
steps to salvation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#7:1>
The first one was speech.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#8:1>
Then came writing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#9:1>
And then came printing." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#10:1>
- - <bold> Isaac Asimov </bold> , from an interview with the author
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#11:1>
And then came reading. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#12:1>
When I was a child and the world was a little younger and there
were no communication satellites over my head, my father accidentally
introduced me to science fiction ( SF).

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#13:1>
He was a member of a club where children were only allowed to eat
potato chips or swim.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#14:1>
It was a stupid rule but I diligently did both till the day an ear
infection made him maroon me in the confines of the <w> club's </w> mournful
and melancholic library full of dusty old books and duster, older people
reading them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#15:1>
I remember I was ten or 11 and kept walking around that maze of
gloomy shelves, one finger tracing the tops of those tomes, one thought
racing through my mind: How do I get out of this place?

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#16:1>
There were no <mention> Hardy </mention> Boys books and no <mention>
Secret Sevens </mention> , so, with indifference, I picked up something
called Best SF 1 or 2 or 3.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#17:1>
I like to think that was a small contribution to the fourth step to
salvation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#18:1>
Mine at least. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#19:1>
Today I have lots of SF anthologies and lots of heroes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#20:1>
Not persons who peopled those stories but people who conjured up
those persons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#21:1>
One such is <mention> Isaac Asimov </mention> with whom <w> I've </w>
had a heavy, one-sided, love-hate relationship.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#22:1>
I loved him for the way he wrote; I hated him for my not being able
to write like that.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#23:1>
Apparently <w> I'm </w> not alone.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#24:1>
When I was talking to the new-wave spokesperson Thomas Disch - -
the SF author <it> <mention> Newsweek </mention> </it> described as the most
formidably gifted unfamous American writer ( and considered to be one of
the <w> genre's </w> most tough and unbrokering critics ) - - a few years
ago, he said, <quote> " I think Asimov is writing the <it> Foundation </it>
things exactly as though it were still 1952 and I think his vision of the
future has remained in place." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#25:1>
How many of ours have? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#26:1>
Mine took a magical leap forward four years ago when Mannika
Chopra of the <it> <mention> Saturday Times </mention> </it> called me from
New Delhi to ask if <w> I'd </w> like to interview the man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#27:1>
<quote> " You're kidding." </quote> I said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#28:1>
<quote> " No way," </quote> she replied, <quote> " the good folk
at the USIS have arranged it all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#29:1>
Brush up on a couple of laws of robotics and come on over." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#30:1>
But when the higher-than-tech equipment had been set up, the
satellite links established, the audience hushed into awe, and Asimov was
ready across a transpacific silence to receive the first question, I had
amen stuck deep in my throat. </p>

Er <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#34:1>
Ten years ago you wrote that nothing of any importance had
happened to you.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#35:1>
How could you say that and what would you consider happening to you
other than world fame, money, cult following, and so many hundred book titles
behind you? </p>

<p> <smallcaps> HIM: </smallcaps>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#36:1>
I haven't traveled; I haven't climbed <O> <*> line</*> </O>
mountains; I haven't met famous people, and I haven't had a narrow escape
from death.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#37:1>
For the most part I simply sit at my typewriter and write and
exercise my imagination. </p> <&> small type end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#38:1>
Lucky us.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#39:1>
Those mental calisthenics have yielded a two-volume guide to <w>
Shakespeare's </w> plays, a commentary on Kipling and Byron, a guide to the
Bible, annotated versions of <it> <mention> Don Juan, </mention> <mention>
Paradise Lost </mention> </it> , and <it> <mention> <w> Gulliver's </w>
Travels </mention> </it> , a treasury of humor, a history of physics, a
treatise on the music of Gilbert and Sullivan, a chronology of science and
discovery, and, of course, all things psychohistorical in a galaxy far away
called the Foundation Tetralogy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#40:1>
Not to mention the three-and-a-half laws of robotics because,
<quote> " <w> I've </w> added," </quote> he said, <quote> " another law in my
recent novel <it> <mention> Robots and Empire </mention> </it> , which I call
the <w> Zubel's </w> Law which is a more fundamental law than the first one (
<quote> ` A robot may not harm a human being, or, through an action, allow a
human being to come to harm' </quote> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#41:1>
This law generalizes to say that a robot may not harm <it> humanity
</it> directly or through an action." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#42:1>
And in between Asimov wrote 467 titles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#43:1>
Often three of them simultaneously.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#44:1>
<w> That's </w> traveling light? </p> <&> small type begin </&>

<p> <smallcaps> ME: </smallcaps>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#45:1>
You mentioned categorically that you don't travel.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#46:1>
But supposing you decided suddenly that you wanted to go
somewhere, where would you go?

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#47:1>
Would you, for instance, plan to come to India?

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#48:1>
Or is it too far away and would involve a long plane journey, which
you are not particularly fond of? </p>

<p> <smallcaps> HIM: </smallcaps>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#49:1>
<w> I've </w> taken ships in my time to Europe and <w> I've </w>
taken trains across the United States, so I can, on rare occasions, take a
few trips.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#50:1>
If ever I decide to retire and before I die, I suppose the first
thing I would want to do would be to visit the Soviet Union because I was
born there and it always strikes me that I <O> sketch <&> column 1 & 2 </&>
</O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 32 </O> would like to see the town in
which I was born and which I left 65 years ago and never returned.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#51:1>
Certainly it would be interesting to go to India as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#52:1>
But I must admit this is more likely to remain a dream than become a
reality. </p> <&> small type end </&>

<h> <bold> The Legacy </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#55:1>
Accepting the Grand Master Nebula Award in 1986 for a <w>
lifetime's </w> achievement in science fiction ( see pages 34-36 ) ,
Asimov said, <quote> " Anyone made Grand Master in his lifetime is ipso
facto a member of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame after he has left us for
the Great and Perpetual Convention in the sky." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#56:1>
Now that Asimov has left us for whatever other things may be
lying about in all the plurality of heavens and earths undreamt of by <w>
Horatio's </w> philosophers, isn't it time to ask why this Russian kid who
taught himself to read English at the age of five while consuming pulp
science fiction in his <w> parents' </w> candy shop in Brooklyn, New York,
was being so prescient and, later, modest? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#57:1>
<quote> " If you don't mind, I would like to say I <it> do </it>
feel humble, and I <it> am </it> honored, and I owe it to lots of other
people - - especially the great John W. Campbell, Jr., who drove me both mad
and to the heights." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#58:1>
Twenty-eight-year-old SF kingmaker Campbell, editor of <it>
Astounding Science-Fiction </it> , was only mildly threatened on June 21,
1938, when our terrified 18-year-old kid made, as Asimov said, <quote> " his
awesome pilgrimage to his office." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#59:1>
He had a story called <quote> " Marooned Off Vesta," </quote> which
saw 17 rejection slips before making it into the light of print.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#60:1>
Campbell read him a quote from <w> Emerson's </w> essays - -
something about how, if human beings could see the stars only once in a
thousand years, they would get a big kick out of it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#61:1>
As a result in September 1941 <quote> " Nightfall" </quote> appeared,
considered by many - - but not its author - - to be his best piece of short
science fiction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#62:1>
In 1990 <it> <mention> Nightfall </mention> </it> appeared again;
this time in book-length form, co-authored by another science fiction writer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#63:1>
Robert Silverberg.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#64:1>
The reception it received can be considered a seminal, though
oblique, commentary on <w> Asimov's </w> accomplishment and heritage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#65:1>
At least as far as his science fiction is concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#66:1>
The book was savaged; the co-author called a <quote> "
sub-contractor." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#67:1>
What happened? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#68:1>
Simple.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#69:1>
Asimov had shown he had staying power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#70:1>
While other major league authors such as Theodore Sturgeon, Ray
Bradbury, Judith Merril, Walter Miller, Jr., Alfred Bester, John Wyndham,
Algis Budrys, Damon Knight, James Blish, Robert Sheckley, Joanna Russ, and
Harlan Ellison either gradually tapered off or completely stopped writing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#71:1>
Asimov just kept going.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#72:1>
Also, other top rankers even started opting out of the field itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#73:1>
Samuel Delany is now head of the department of comparative
literature at the University of Massachusetts where most of his writing is
nonfiction; J.G. Ballard turned to semiautobiography and his <it> <mention>
Empire of the Sun </mention> </it> became a mega-Spielberg film in 1987; John
Sladek who wrote extensively about robots is now an executive in a firm that
designs real robots.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#74:1>
While Asimov <*> dotted line</*> just kept going. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#75:1>
So much so that in a recent issue of <it> <mention> The Atlantic
Monthly </mention> </it> , Thomas Disch virtually owns up to that fact
when he says, <quote> " I remember how at the 1969 SF convention I spoke
dismissively of the <quote> ` dinosaurs' </quote> then impeding the proper
appreciation of young mammals like myself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#76:1>
Twenty-three years later all but a couple of the dinosaurs I had
in mind remain the commanding presences in the field <*> dotted line</*> and
some of my fellow mammals now look more and more like dinosaurs." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#77:1>
The other odd in the couple, of course, being Arthur C.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#78:1>
Clarke. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#79:1>
Together Asimov and Clarke fashioned a commonality of futures
in the <O> <&> page </&> 33 </O> early 1950s, which, although sometimes
dismissed as being a <quote> " cheery Buck Rogers universe of space travel
and infinite economic expansion," </quote> nevertheless managed to ride
out the invasion of the mid-1960s <quote> " mammals" </quote> whose own
futures tended to destroy the icons of the edifice they inherited and, in
the process, themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#80:1>
Amazingly, the duo then turned around and faced the latest SF
<quote> " peak," </quote> the cyberpunks of the 1980s and 1990s whose
graffiti is generally an affirmation that the future is a mess and a lot of
it <quote> " is in terrible repair, and the rest is mostly an electronic
illusion, but you might as well enjoy it while it lasts." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#81:1>
Historically they are still too close for us to reap the rewards of
hindsight, but going by an op-ed piece that appeared in <it> <mention> The
New York Times </mention> </it> of January 7, 1991, it seems the new guard is
definitely floundering.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#82:1>
In it Lewis Shiner, a cyberpunk writer, publicly resigned from the
movement.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#83:1>
<quote> " <w> I'm </w> 39 years old," </quote> he said somewhat
chillingly, as if perpetrating the myth that most great works of art are
accomplished before the age of 35 or that science fiction writers are under a
peculiar obligation to stay young. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#84:1>
There you have it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#85:1>
Isaac Asimov was 72 years old when he died in April this year.

<ICE-IND:W2B-002#86:1>
One of the last things he said to me in that interview was, <quote> "
I don't want to die, particularly because <w> I've </w> got many more books
to write." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-002#87:1>
