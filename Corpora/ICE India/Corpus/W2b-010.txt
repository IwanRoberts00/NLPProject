<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#3:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> strange desire for
anonymity in ancient India has led to the loss of a sizeable portion of our
art history over the years - - almost up to the 17th century.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#4:1>
Consequently, the modern art-historian faces the difficult task
of reconstructing facts, through a study of the sculpture and the literature
of relevant periods, and basing them more on surmise and conjecture than
on established facts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#5:1>
However, a few undeterred researchers have managed to present a
fairly comprehensive account of the growth and development of the
performing art forms in Karnataka. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#6:1>
That dance existed in a very highly evolved form in Karnataka
is evident from a study of the exquisitely carved dancing <indig> <it>
Madanikas </it> </indig> of the Belur and Halebid temples.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#7:1>
There are also in existence innumerable legends which describe the
dances of the Hoysala queens, Shantala and Sovalla, in the pillared halls of
these temples - - these belong to the 12th and 13th centuries AD. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#8:1>
It is apparent that out of these classical dance forms that
flourished in the temples and courts of Karnataka has emerged what is
known today as the <quote> ` Mysore style' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#9:1>
It should also be mentioned that the great universities of Talapadi
and Talagunda ( 4th to 13th centuries) offered courses in classical dance
and music, as also the royal dynasties of the <O> Photograph in two colums
</O> <O> caption </O> Rastrakutas, the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas, the kings of
Vijayanagar and the Wadeyars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#10:1>
There is a substantial amount of evidence in Kannada
literature, as almost every medieval Kannada poet seems to have been a
connoisseur of music and dance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#11:1>
<indig> Mahakavi </indig> Pampa, for instance, mentions Bharatha (
the compiler of the <indig> <it> Natyasastra </it> </indig> ) by name as the
<quote> " author of the dance" </quote> while Ponna, Ranna and Nagachandra
use the word <quote> ` Bharatha' </quote> to indicate dance, drama and music.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#12:1>
Bahubali, Bhimakavi and Singaraja poets of a later period also refer
copiously to Bharatha. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#13:1>
In addition to these, there seems to be a considerable body of
epigraphical evidence to draw upon, like the famous Nallalla copper plates (
6th century AD) and other inscriptions which extol Vishnuvardhana, queen
Shantala and other patrons and dancers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#14:1>
The earliest mention of <indig> Bharata </indig> Natyam is to
be found in the famous <indig> <it> kriti </it> </indig> of Purandaradasa,
<indig> <it> Adidano Ranga </it> </indig> where the word <indig> <it> Adidano
</it> </indig> obviously referred to <quote> ` dance' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#15:1>
From all these we can deduce that <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig>
in ancient and medieval Karnataka existed both in temples and the courts of
kings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#16:1>
As is widely known, the classical dance in south India was primarily
a temple art, practised by <indig> Devadasis </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#17:1>
The temple dancers not only performed at all the temple festivals
but participated in the daily ritual of worship as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#18:1>
The <indig> Devadasis </indig> of the temples in Kolar, Bangalore
and Muguru were accomplished dancers, like the famous Jeejamma, Kalamma <O>
Photograph </O> <O> caption </O> and others who paid great attention to
<indig> <it> abhinaya </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#19:1>
Some of them were not averse to dancing for social occasions and
often presented erotic songs in the <indig> <it> Lokadharmi </it> </indig>
style. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#20:1>
However, because of the growing denigration of the art, most fo
these dancers faded away and ended their days in abject penury and neglect.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#21:1>
The court dancers, on the contrary, flourished because of royal
patronage, until about 1952, when the custom of appointing <indig> <it>
Asthana Vidhushis </it> </indig> was given up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#22:1>
They enriched <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> and added a new
dimension to the <indig> abhinaya </indig> aspect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#23:1>
About the 19th century, the four Tanjore brothers - -
Chinnayya, Ponniah, Shivanandam and Vadivelu - - gave the <indig>
Bharata Natyam </indig> recital a fresh look and a new format which is
followed even today.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#24:1>
The eldest of them, Chinnayya, was invited to the royal court of
Mysore by the king, where he settled down and helped to develop the already
existing dance form. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#25:1>
Incidentally, it was during the Wadeyar regime that <indig>
Bharata Natyam </indig> was concentrated in Mysore, the capital city, and
attained a definite status.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#26:1>
Attracted by the generosity and encouragement of the Wadeyars,
artists of great ability and reputation began to flock to the Mysore
court.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#27:1>
A school was set up in Srirangapatnam during <O> continued on Page 8
</O> <O> <&> in two columns </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#28:1>
Classical dance <*> dotted line</*> </O> <O> continued from Page Page
5 </O> Narasaraja <w> Wadeyar's </w> regime ( 1638 to 1659 AD ) where young
girls were trained in <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#29:1>
<it> Geetagopala </it> and <it> Chikkadevaraya Saptapadi </it>
were composed in the style of <w> Jayadeva's </w> <it> Ashtapadi </it> by
Chikkadevaraya Wadeyar ( 1672-1704 ) and were primarily meant for dancing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#30:1>
The <it> Churnika </it> , a musical piece in praise of the kings and
the <O> Photograph <&> in two columns </&> </O> <O> caption </O> audience,
began to be performed before the start of a <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig>
recital and soon became a part and parcel of the <quote> ` Mysore style'
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#31:1>
It was during Krishnaraja <w> Wadeyar's </w> rule ( 1811-1868)
that the existing traditions of dance merged and what is now referred to as
the Mysore School emerged with certain distinctive traits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#32:1>
Illustrious <indig> gurus </indig> like Muguru Subbanna, Kittappa
and Giriappa and accomplished dancers like Muguru Ammanniamma, Coimbatore
Tayi, Bangalore Nagarathnamma and Jetti Tayamma worked hard to build up the
Mysore style.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#33:1>
They were not only well-versed in Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada but
also had a profound knowledge of Carnatic music and the technique of
<indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#34:1>
Some of the <indig> Devadasis </indig> built up libraries of rare
manuscripts and had special songs composed for their recitals by their
learned musical associates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#35:1>
They even created a guild of dancers consisting of senior dancers,
teachers, and scholars well-versed in <w> Bharatha's </w> <indig> <it>
Natyasastra </it> </indig> , which established very high standards in dance.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#36:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> HOW </smallcaps> </bold> exactly should the
Mysore school of <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> be defined?

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#37:1>
<indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> is basically the same all over
south India with slight differences, if any, from region to region - -
comparable to the <indig> <it> gharanas </it> </indig> of the Hindustani
music and the <indig> <it> banis </it> </indig> of the Carnatic music.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#38:1>
The Mysore style is characterised by certain special performing
conventions such as the <indig> <it> Mangala sloka </it> </indig> sung by the
Nattuvanar at the beginning, followed by <indig> <it> Tattakara </it>
</indig> on the cymbals, the <indig> <it> Ganesha Van dana </it> </indig>
, and the <indig> <it> Mangala </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#39:1>
After this lengthy presemble, the dancer comes in, salutes the
<indig> guru </indig> and the audience, and then performs a <indig> <it>
Churnika </it> </indig> - - a Sanskrit prologue in prose ( without <indig>
<it> tala </it> </indig> , but set to a single <indig> <it> raga </it>
</indig> ) enumerating the constituents of dance and music as laid down by
Bharatha.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#40:1>
Before this, the <indig> <it> Pushpanjali </it> </indig> , scattering
flowers all over the stage, is performed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#41:1>
After this follows the entire recital of <indig> <it> Sadir
Katcheri </it> </indig> ranging from the <indig> <it> alarippu </it> </indig>
to the <indig> <it> tillanna </it> </indig> followed by <indig> <it> abhinaya
</it> </indig> for <indig> <it> slokas </it> </indig> and <indig> <it>
Javalis </it> </indig> , considered the highlight of the programme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#42:1>
Thus, barring minor divergences based on individual
preferences and regional differenes, the Bharata Natyam recital has
the same routine throughout south India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#43:1>
It is also said that the Mysore School places greater stress on
<indig> <it> abhinaya </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> nritya </it> </indig>
than on <indig> <it> nritta </it> </indig> or pure dance which is by no means
neglected.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#44:1>
This is perhaps due to the fact that eminent musicians who resided in
the court then composed special songs for the dancers, who responded by
bringing out the various nuances of the song, through their exquisite dancing
and miming. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#45:1>
Talking of <indig> <it> abhinaya </it> </indig> reminds us of the
legendary Jetti Tayamma who reached unparalleled heights in this
particular aspect of dance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#46:1>
Some scholars attribute the <indig> <it> Churnika </it> </indig> to
her, for she was not only an exquisite dancer, but an erudite scholar who had
been trained by the learned poets of the royal court and was capable of
creativity of the highest order. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#47:1>
The court dancer or <indig> <it> Asthana Vidhushi </it> </indig>
, we are told, was specially selected from groups of highly-trained
dancers, wellversed in <indig> <it> nritta, nritya </it> </indig> and
<indig> <it> natya </it> </indig> , by a panel of scholars, musicians and
connoisseurs of the art.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#48:1>
Her training continued even after her appointment, and she had to
invariably perform at the palace on the birthdays of the <indig> Maharajas
</indig> , during the famed <indig> Dassara </indig> celebrations and other
special occasions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#49:1>
Incidentally, the Mysore style abounds in Sanskrit <indig> <it>
slokas, ashtapadas </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> Javalis </it> </indig>
probably because of the close association that <indig> <it> Asthana Vidhushis
</it> </indig> had with the scholars and composers of the court.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#50:1>
Extempore improvisation was the hallmark of good <indig> <it>
abhinaya </it> </indig> and often the palace dancers were acclaimed for their
capacity to <quote> " create on the spot" </quote> and winning great
approbation from the <foreign> <it> cognoscenti </it> </foreign> and
scholars of the court.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#51:1>
This is probably the reason for the style acquiring the reputation
of laying greater stress on <indig> <it> abhinaya </it> </indig> than on
<indig> <it> nritta </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#52:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ABOUT </smallcaps> </bold> the third quarter of
the present century, inspired by patriotic fervour and the consequent desire
to revive our cultural forms, a great renascence of our performing arts
took place.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#53:1>
Artists and intellectuals in Karnataka, as in the rest of South
India, made attempts to bring dance, music and drama - - which by now had
become separate art forms - - on to the stage, and succeeded.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#54:1>
Thus dance ceased to be a temple and palace art and became an art of
the theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#55:1>
Inevitably, the monopoly of the temple and palace dancers ended and
the dance form was thrown open to dancers from all strata of society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#56:1>
Uday Shankar, inspired by Pavlova, the great ballerina, came back
from the West and helped considerably in converting the art into a proper
theatre form with suitable accoutrement like lighting, decor, orchestrated
music, costumes and thematic content.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#57:1>
Rukmini Devi entered the arena of <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> at
the age of 32.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#58:1>
She also set up the famed school, Kalakshetra, wherein the classical
dance form, particularly <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> , were refined
and made suitable for <}> <-> threatical </-> <+> theatrical </+> </}>
presentation in the shape of dancedramas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#59:1>
In Karnataka, U.S. Krishna Rao and Chandobagha Devi, through
their pioneering efforts, made dancing respectable and acceptable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#60:1>
Senior dancers like Shanta Rao, Leela Ramanathan and Maya Rao have
also set up their institutions in Bangalore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#61:1>
There are several other senior <indig> gurus </indig> and dancers
who have set up successful dance schools in Mysore, Bangalore, Kolar,
Mangalore and other cities of Karnataka.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#62:1>
Some of the young dancers work for the departments of dance in
universities while some others teach in well-known dance schools.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#63:1>
A few work at jobs which are totally unrelated to their art, in order
not only to survive but to sustain and support their dancing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#64:1>
After Independence, the personal patronage of the king has
been replaced by the impersonal patronage of the Government dispersed through
its academies and departments of culture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#65:1>
The warm, personal relationship between the patron and the artist
has been replaced by the objective impersonal patronage of bureaucracy
which of course can become corrupt, if misused.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#66:1>
However, one good that has emerged out of all this is that the art is
no longer elitist or monopolistic but is made freely available to the
common man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#67:1>
The conversion of a temple art into a theatre art has led to
certain fundamental changes in the format and objectives of the classical
dance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#68:1>
For one, classical dance - - which was a spiritual offering to the
Lord presented symbolically, through a depiction of human themes and
emotions - - meant to lift the spectator to a higher state, through
entertainment, as laid down by Bharatha. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#69:1>
It has now become a theatre art meant to delight and entertain
general audiences.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#70:1>
Certain changes have become inevitable such as shortening the
durations of recitals, altering choreography to suit the stage, changing
the repertoire, and paying greater attention to lighting, costume and the
literary content of songs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#71:1>
In Karnataka a noteworthy contemporary tendency among the dancers
is their keen interest in the dance-drama form.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#72:1>
Some are falling back upon the <indig> <it> puranas </it> </indig>
and <indig> <it> itihasas </it> </indig> for thematic content, while others
are experimenting with new topics which are relevant to contemporary life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#73:1>
The Yakshagana dancedrama form, which made its appearance
around the 12th century and which has its roots in the classical Sanskrit
drama of the 4th century, is flourishing again as a popular theatre art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#74:1>
There are many <indig> Parishats, Sabhas </indig> , the State
academies, the department of Kannada and Culture and of course innumerable
schools where <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> , which continues to be the
most prevalent form in Karnataka, is taught.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#75:1>
With unbelievably large numbers of youths taking to dance, the
competition is overwhelming. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#76:1>
Apart from <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig> , other forms slowly
gaining ground are <indig> Kuchipudi, Kathak </indig> and <indig> Mohini
Attam </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#77:1>
<indig> Odissi </indig> of Manipuri are lagging behind, though
performances of these forms seem quite popular. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#78:1>
Dancing for the television shows is the latest fad, because young
dancers feel they are able to reach out to larger audiences.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#79:1>
In fact, the dancer has never had it so good, with the opportunities
offered in the shape of scholarships, participation in workshops and
competititons, the chances to perform at festivals both at home and abroad
and on television. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#80:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> WHAT </smallcaps> </bold> is the future of dance
in our country as a whole and in Karnataka in particular?

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#81:1>
Going by the present trends, one can visualise the future fairly
clearly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#82:1>
One such trend is that dancing is becoming a group effort.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#83:1>
Solo dances are no longer popular either with patrons of the art or
the general audiences who seem to prefer dance-dramas with a plethora of
characters, group performances with as many dancers as the stage can hold,
and combined choreographic presentations of a number of <indig> gurus
</indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#84:1>
This trend may develop further, until permanent troupes of
dancers are maintained by governments in all States.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#85:1>
To qualify to be a member of one of these troupes will be the
<foreign> <it> summum bonum </it> </foreign> of a <w> dancer's </w>
career.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#86:1>
There may come a time when the individual or solo dancer may be
looked upon as an eccentric and will have a hard furrow to plough. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#87:1>
Another trend is the realisation that apart from depicting
myths and legends centred around gods and goddesses, dancing could be used to
express contemporary life and its problems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#88:1>
This is bound to result in the art losing its inherent
spirituality and impersonality, and becoming a highly personalised and
subjective expression of a <w> dancer's </w> individuality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#89:1>
Such trends may lead to a hybridisation of styles and forms which
would ignore the glorious heritage of dancing that we have inherited from
our ancestors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-010#90:1>
On the contrary, it may also lead to the creation of a common or
national style of dancing, similar to the <indig> Bharata Natyam </indig>
prevalent in the country before the 10th century AD. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-010#91:1>
Fortunately, in Karnataka the classical dance tradition has
always been a dynamic one and will, one is sure, continue to flourish
because our dancers, however <foreign> avant-garde </foreign> they are, have
a great respect for our ancient dance culture and have always created and
innovated within its framework. </p> <*> filled circle </*> </I>
