<bold> <&> Chapter </&> 10 </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#2:1>
The rail car came out of the long tunnel into the Himalayan
country.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#3:1>
Tunnel number 16 was the dividing point between the plains and the
hills.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#4:1>
Under the early evening light, the earth was covered with pastel
shades of green.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#5:1>
The white car pulled up at Barog station, and everyone, except two
passengers, got out to have tea. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#6:1>
A girl who had been sitting on the other side came over and opened
the window in front of Bauji.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#7:1>
The cool air poured in.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#8:1>
<quote> ` Chinese set to grab our land' </quote> , screamed a newsboy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#9:1>
Leaning far out of the window, the girl called out to the boy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#10:1>
She spoke louder than necessary, as if he were a great distance away.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#11:1>
The boy, weighed down with books, papers and magazines, hurriedly
walked over to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#12:1>
His face was partially buried in a scarf.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#13:1>
It must be could, thought Bauji.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#14:1>
And here was this boy burdened by the useless rhetoric of
politicians.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#15:1>
It was good to be free and a democracy, but the politicians were a
price that had to be paid for this privilege.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#16:1>
The girl bought a newspaper, and a copy of the <mention> <it>
Illustrated Weekly of India </it> . </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#17:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> getting cold isn't it?" </quote> she said
to the boy as he handed her the change.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#18:1>
Bauji was bothered by the melancholy news of the Chinese, but he
tried to put it out of his mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#19:1>
Instead, he thought of the girl.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#20:1>
He thought that she had a beautiful young voice, but it was also a
little sad.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#21:1>
From the material and the cut of her coat, he surmised that she came
from a wealthy family.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#22:1>
Her youth and her manner suggested that she was unmarried; her tone
of voice was that of someone who was used to getting her way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#23:1>
The girl shut the window, and pressed her hands to her slightly
red cheeks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#24:1>
She moved back to her seat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#25:1>
The tea drinkers returned+ the dining room, and the rail car pulled
away from the station.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#26:1>
It had begun to grow dark outside and soon the lights were turned on
inside the car.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#27:1>
As a result, the windows were transformed into mirrors, and it
created a strange atmosphere of forced intimacy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#28:1>
Putting his face against the window, Bauji tried to look out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#29:1>
The sky <O> 191 </O> behind the mountain carried red traces of the
setting sun.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#30:1>
Individual shapes on the dusky landscape although still visible,
were becoming harder to distinguish.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#31:1>
The train climbed the northern slope of the second range into another
tunnel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#32:1>
They came out at the other end in a mountain valley.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#33:1>
Sudden faint bursts of colour appeared from the chasms between the
mountain peaks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#34:1>
His gaze returned to the girl, who was now absorbed in the
magazine.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#35:1>
He was looking at her from an unusual angle, and peculiar emotions
welled up inside him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#36:1>
As he stared at her long neck, bent slightly to one side, he seemed
to feel the vital memory of the woman he had left behind in Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#37:1>
However, the more he tried to call up a clear picture, the more his
memory failed him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#38:1>
She seemed to fade far away, leaving him with nothing to catch or to
hold.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#39:1>
In the midst of the clouded past, the neck of the girl in front
reappeared - - it was damp - - and it seemed to push him forward into the
future.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#40:1>
Suddenly <w> Anees' </w> eyes floated before him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#41:1>
He gasped in astonishment.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#42:1>
The figures and the background were unrelated, sometimes vivid, other
times dim, melting together in a strange combination of the past and the
present.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#43:1>
A light from the outside unexpectedly flashed on the <w> girl's </w>
face, and Bauji felt his chest rise at its strange beauty.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#44:1>
The face in the mirror-window moved steadily across the landscape.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#45:1>
He woke up with a start.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#46:1>
As he came to, he realised he must have been dreaming.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#47:1>
The reflection of the girl in front was still there in the window.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#48:1>
He hastily lowered his eyes, feeling guilty for having+ at the
stranger.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#49:1>
To cover up his embarrassment, he put his face to the window and
looked at the darkness outside.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#50:1>
At the next moment, he pulled out a large white handkerchief, and
cleared the steam which had gathered on the window. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#51:1>
The bewitching stranger continued to read.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#52:1>
From the way her shoulders were gathered, Bauji sensed an
independence of nature.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#53:1>
The peculiar angle at which her neck was tilted suggested more,
perhaps a touch of arrogance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#54:1>
There was a fierce intentness in her eyes, which did not permit her
even to blink.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#55:1>
It was a cool, piercing beauty, which exerted a strange, unreal power
in the mirror-window.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#56:1>
Feeling startled, Bauji lowered his eyes again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#57:1>
Although he knew it was improper to stare like this, he consoled
himself with the thought that there was no way for her to know that she was
the object of his attention.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#58:1>
From where he sat, he could see what she was reading.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#59:1>
Having just completed a short story, she was now skimming over an
article on <w> Nehru's </w> China policy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#60:1>
The man sitting next <O> <&> page </&> 192 </O> to her also saw her
reading it, and he could not contain himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#61:1>
<quote> " How dare the Chinese cast eyes on our land!" </quote>
he said to her with outrage in his voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#62:1>
<quote> " Well, it is disputed territory, isn't it ? " </quote>
said the girl. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#63:1>
<X> <quote> " Disputed, my foot !

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X64:1>
They have tricked us.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X65:1>
First they talk of friendship and <indig> <it> Hindi-Chini bhai bhai
</it> </indig> and then they want to take over our soil." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#66:1>
Before the girl could answer, he turned around to face Bauji, hoping
to find a more sympathetic listener.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#67:1>
Bauji did not want to talk to the man, but he changed his mind
because he thought it might be a way to get to know the girl. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#68:1>
<quote> " It is <w> Nehru's </w> fault for believing them,"
</quote> said Bauji.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#69:1>
<X> <quote> " He is too much of an idealist and forgets that the
pursuit of the <w> nation's </w> self-interest is the only responsible course
for a leader.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X70:1>
Moralising must take second place.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X71:1>
He feels let down by the Chinese because he trusted+

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X72:1>
And <w> there's </w> no room for trust in these things." </quote>
</X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#73:1>
Not finding Bauji sympathetic to his point of view, the man
grunted and turned around in a huff.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#74:1>
The girl did not get a chance to say anything because of the abrupt
way the man closed the subject.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#75:1>
Or more likely, Bauji thought, she did not want to get into a
conversation with strangers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#76:1>
The rail car again became silent and Bauji went back into his own
private world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#77:1>
Bauji was startled when the rail car reached Simla.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#78:1>
He saw the girl rise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#79:1>
He had been lost in thought for three-quarters-of-an-hour.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#80:1>
His private battles against Nehru as well as his secret romance in
the mirror-window had disappeared in the reality of the brightly lit
platform.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#81:1>
Suddenly, he spotted Tara and Seva Ram in the distance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#82:1>
He did not wait for them to approach, but stepped out of the carriage
with a resolute step.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#83:1>
As soon as Tara reached him, she flung her arm around his neck, drew
him rapidly to her, and embraced her father warmly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#84:1>
<w> Bauji's </w> eyes sought out the attractive stranger, who was now
on the platform, surrounded by several equally well-dressed people.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#85:1>
She obviously belonged to the best society.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#86:1>
Standing there, he thought she was not beautiful, but rather there
was a youthful elegance and grace about her whole figure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#87:1>
As he looked around, she too turned her head.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#88:1>
Her shining, dark eyes, that looked darker from the thick lashes,
rested with cold attention on his face ( as though she were recognising him)
and then she promptly turned away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#89:1>
In that brief look, he noticed a suppressed eagerness which flitted
between her brilliant eyes and a faint smile that curved her lips.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#90:1>
It was the look of a young lady who is sure of her own beauty, and
like all such women, a little cruel. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 193 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#91:1>
<quote> " <w> She's </w> very sweet, isn't she?" </quote> said
Tara. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#92:1>
<X> <quote> " Sweet?

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X93:1>
Do you know her?" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#94:1>
<quote> " Yes," </quote> relied Tara, as she waved to the girl,
who waved back enthusiastically.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#95:1>
There was a bustle in the station as the+ train from Kalka was
approaching, several hours late.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#96:1>
The black and white signal indicated <quote> ` down' </quote> , and
there was a rush of porters, attendants and people meeting the train.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#97:1>
Through the vapour, could be seen ill-clad workmen crossing the
rails.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#98:1>
The engine whistled in the distance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#99:1>
Seconds later, the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam
hanging low in the air from the cold, the engine rolled up, the lever of its
middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the figure of the engine
driver stooping low. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#100:1>
In the confusion of the arriving train, the girl had disappeared
in the crowd.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#101:1>
<quote> " Can you guess?" </quote> asked Tara. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#102:1>
<X> <quote> " What?" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#103:1>
<X> <quote> " Who she is?" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#104:1>
He shook his head. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#105:1>
<X> <quote> " Your friend Sanat <w> Mehta's </w> grand-daughter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#X106:1>
She lives here with her mother." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#107:1>
<X> <quote> " What is her name?" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#108:1>
<X> <quote> " Priti." </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#109:1>
<bold> <&> Chapter </&> 11 </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#110:1>
It was the day of the <w> Mehtas' </w> reception.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#111:1>
Since morning, Arjun had been in a state of wild excitement.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#112:1>
As he was combing his hair in the mirror, he was overcome with
despair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#113:1>
He thought he was not good looking.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#114:1>
He imagined there could be no happiness for one with such long ears,
such a broad nose, thick lips, and brown eyes as his.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#115:1>
He would have given anything for a handsome face so that he could
appear attractive to Priti. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#116:1>
Karan came promptly at seven to collect them for the reception.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#117:1>
He had informed the Mehtas that <indig> Bauji </indig> would also
come.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#118:1>
When Karan saw Tara, his eyes widened and he remarked that she
looked beautiful.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#119:1>
She felt flattered because she had gone to considerable trouble to
put up her hair in a special bun, which was considered fashionable at the
time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#120:1>
Arjun too was proud of his+ and thought that she looked lovely in
her Madras silk <indig> sari </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#121:1>
So rarely did they go out that Arjun felt it strange to see his
mother all dressed up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#122:1>
He was proud that her thick hair was still black, and the bun showed
her long neck and her ears to advantage.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#123:1>
She wore her <indig> sari </indig> in modern style, comfortably and
not too tightly, with a nicely cut blouse, which focused on her attractive
bosom and gave her a lean and youthful look. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#124:1>
Karan invited <indig> Bauji </indig> to ride in his rickshaw but
<indig> Bauji </indig> refused.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#125:1>
He was still upset with Karan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#126:1>
Thus father and daughter rode together and Arjun rode with Karan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#127:1>
As they rode to the Mehta house in the raw chill of the Simla
autumn, Arjun tried to imagine the brilliance of the grand reception that
awaited them -- the brightly lit drawing rooms, the splendour of the clothes,
the sumptuously laid food, the dignitaries and important people.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#128:1>
Karan had said in an off-hand way that a Cabinet Minister and the
Governor would be coming, as well as several members of the diplomatic corps
who were visiting Simla.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#129:1>
While Arjun was lost in the spectacle of his imagination, Tara was
preoccupied in safeguarding her hair and her silk <indig> sari </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-005#130:1>
As they approached the Mehta house, they were impressed by <O>
<&> page </&> 195 </O> the brilliant lights which blazed from the numerous
windows of the mansion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#131:1>
A police guard stood at the brightly lit, carpeted entrance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#132:1>
As the rickshaws drove away, new ones took their place.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#133:1>
From the rickshaws descended beautifully dressed women.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#134:1>
Before Arjun realized what was happening, they were in the mirrored
vestibule, taking off their coats, helped by a liveried servant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#135:1>
Arjun tried to assume a dignified manner appropriate to the
occasion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#136:1>
He glanced into the mirrors, but he could not see himself clearly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#137:1>
He seemed to+ a part of one glittering whole.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#138:1>
As they reached the door leading to the main drawing room, a
continuous sound of voices and glasses and the rustle of silk <indig> saris
</indig> greeted them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#139:1>
Amrita was at the door, and she smiled at them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-005#140:1>
She greeted <indig> Bauji </indig> with special warmth. </p> </I>
