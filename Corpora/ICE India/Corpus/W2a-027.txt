<ICE-IND:W2A-027#4:1>
The androgenic regulation of the eleven enzymes of glycolytic
pathway and two key enzymes of HMP pathway was studied in the initial
segment, caput, corpus and cauda regions of the epididymis and in the vas
deferens of rhesus monkey.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#5:1>
The specific activities of enzymes were expressed as units of activity
per mg DNA.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#6:1>
Results in control animals indicate a marked difference in energy
metabolism of epididymis and vas deferens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#7:1>
However, the epididymal duct itself did not show much regional
variation in enzyme activities along its length.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#8:1>
All the enzymes of the two pathways studied showed significant
reduction after castration, the regulatory enzymes being affected more
severely.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#9:1>
On treatment with exogenous dihydrotestosterone, most of these
enzymes showed stimulation in castrated monkeys, but non of them could be
restored to normal level.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#10:1>
The stimulation of these enzymes on treatment with exogenous
dihydrotestosterone varied along the epididymal duct itself being maximum
in the initial segment and minimum in the cauda region.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#11:1>
The changes in the vas deferens were less marked as compared to the
epididymis following castration and androgen replacement. </p> </&> <&> in
two columns </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#12:1>
The mammalian epididymis is a dynamic organ, and is dependent
upon testicular androgens for the maintenance of its structure as well as for
its secretory, resorptive, biosynthetic and other metabolic activities
<sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#13:1>
All these functions are adversely affected following androgen
withdrawal ( e.g. castration or hypophysectomy ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#14:1>
In most laboratory animals, castration or hypophysectomy results
in a rapid decline in the development of sperm fertilizing ability within 4-7
days and the loss of sperm viability after 1-2 weeks <sp> <fnr> 2-4 </fnr>
</sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#15:1>
However, the nature of the androgen dependent processes of the
epididymis that are essential for sperm maturation and storage remain
elusive.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#16:1>
It is probable that nourishment of epididymal duct may directly or
indirectly affect sperm maturation and storage.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#17:1>
Carbohydrates ( e.g. glucose ) form a ready source of nourishment for
most type of cells in the body.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#18:1>
A detailed study of the glycolytic pathway, the primary pathway
for intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates, and its androgenic
regulation in mammalian epididymis, is therefore necessary. Brooks <sp> <fnr>
5 </fnr> </sp> carried out detailed study of the glycolytic pathway in rat
epididymis and found it to be testicular dependent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#19:1>
We carried out similar studies in rhesus monkey epididymis for two
main reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#20:1>
Firstly, although rat has served as a useful model in many basic
studies on epididymal function and sperm <O> <*> a short line in column</*>

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#22:1>
<*> dagger</*> Correspondent author. </footnote> </O> maturation it
is not certain that this animal can serve as a suitable model for
understanding epididymal function in human male.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#23:1>
In recent years non-human primates are being considered at better
models for studies on reproductive biology and contraception.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#24:1>
Besides, the preclinical studies on the development of a
contraceptive requires evaluation in a primate model, therefore, it is
necessary to have baseline data in commonly used primate model such as the
rhesus monkey.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#25:1>
Secondly, Brooks has expressed all the enzyme specific activities as
units per gram wet weight of issue.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#26:1>
However, according to his own findings <sp> <fnr> 6 </fnr> </sp>
castration results in a loss in epididymal weight, which is mainly due to
cytoplasmic shrinkage rather than due to a change in cell population.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#27:1>
Thus a unit weight of epididymal tissue in normal and castrated rat
is likely to have a large difference in the number of cells and therefore,
the actual change in enzyme activities within these cells is likely to be
obscured by a change in their size and weight.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#28:1>
On the other hand DNA, which is the genetic material, is present
in the same amount in every somatic cell of the body, irrespective of its
physiological and metabolic activity and it also remains unchanged
under altered physiological conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#29:1>
Thus a unit weight of DNA represents almost a fixed number of cells.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#30:1>
We have, therefore, expressed all the enzyme activities as units per
mg DNA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#31:1>
Functionally the epididymis can be distinguished into a proximal
part consisting of caput and corpus <O> <&> page </&> 306 </O> where the
spermatozoa undergo a process of maturation <sp> <fnr> 7-9 </fnr> </sp>
and a distal portion called the cauda which serves mainly as a storehouse of
mature spermatozoa <sp> <fnr> 10 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#32:1>
In the present study the monkey epididymis was divided into four
major segments <sp> <fnr> 11 </fnr> </sp> to see if the segments performing
different functions also differed in their metabolism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#33:1>
Vas deferens has not been assigned any function in relation to
sperm maturation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#34:1>
It serves as a conduit and conveys epididymal sperm to the
ejaculatory duct.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#35:1>
It may also form a part of the sperm reservoir <sp> <fnr> 12,13
</fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#36:1>
Vas deferens was also included in the present studies for
comparison of its metabolism with that of the cauda epididymis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#46:1>
The castrated animals were divided into 2 groups of 6 animals
each.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#47:1>
One group of castrated animals was maintained for 90 days, while the
other group after 60 days received 2 mg 5a-dihydrotestosterone daily for 30
days.

<h> Dose rationale : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#50:1>
The daily dose of 2 mg DHT was chosen from the findings of Ewing <it>
et al </it> . <sp> <fnr> 14 </fnr> </sp> , who showed that testosterone
production rate in adult rhesus monkeys is about 1.06 mg / day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#51:1>
It has already been shown that release of DHT by silastic implants in
castrated monkeys is more effective than that of testosterone in restoring
the weights of accessory sex organs <sp> <fnr> 15,16 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#52:1>
Since DHT was administered by injection procedure rather than by
sustained release through silastic implant, we used DHT at twice the
estimated production rate i.e. 2 mg / day. </p>

ice-cold normal saline.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#55:1>
The epididymis was cleared free of fat and adhering tissues, and
divided into four major regions, viz. initial segment, caput, corpus and

The homogenising medium and the enzyme assays used were those
described earlier by Brooks <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#60:1>
The assays were performed at 25 <*> degrees</*>C against blanks in

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#61:1>
Assays conditions were chosen to maximise enzyme activities and to
ensure zero order kinetics.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#62:1>
Reaction rates were always linear during the recording period and
directly proportional to the amount of homogenate added.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#63:1>
The assays were run in a Pye Unicam PU 8610 recording

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#68:1>
Total protein and DNA levels showed little regional variation along
the epididymal duct.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#69:1>
The vas deferens also showed similar levels of protein but the
concentration of DNA was lower ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.001 ) as compared
to that in epididymis ( Table 1 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#70:1>
As we move from the proximal to the distal region of the
epididymis, we do not find a sharp change in the activities of the glycolytic
and HMP pathway enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#71:1>
Most of the enzyme activities did not show significant differences
between adjacenet segments ( Table 2 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#72:1>
In general the glycolytic enzymes showed higher activity and HMP
pathway enzymes showed lower activity in the initial segment as compared to
the other segments of epididymis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#73:1>
However, as we move from cauda epididymis to vas deferens we find a
sharp increase in the activities of all the glycolytic enzymes and a
significant fall in the activities of HMP pathway enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#74:1>
The difference was statistically significant in case of most of
the enzymes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#75:1>
The enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase of
glycolytic pathway exhibit low maximum activities in the epididymal
segments as well as in the vas deferens indicating the possibility of these
enzymes in regulating the flux through the glycolytic pathway in both
epididymis as well as in the vas deferent. <O> <&> page </&> 307 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#76:1>
Both these organs exhibit a similarity in the trend of activities of
glycolytic enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#77:1>
Triose phosphate isomerase was the most active enzyme and aldolase
was the least active enzyme of the pathway in the two organs. </p>

Three months after castration there was a marked reduction in the
wet weights of all the epididymal segments ( control vs castrated for all
segments P<*>smaller than</*>0.01 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#80:1>
The involution of vas deferens was however less marked ( P<0.05).

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#81:1>
Total protein concentration did not show change after castration (
Table 1 ) but its content per segment decreased significantly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#82:1>
On the other hand DNA concentration increased significantly while its
content per segment did not change markedly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#83:1>
Vas deferens registered a small increase in DNA concentration after
castration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#84:1>
The activities of all the eleven enzymes of glycolytic pathway
and the two key enzymes of HMP pathway were reduced significantly in all the
segments of the epididymis after castration ( Figs 1-4 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#85:1>
Although the reduction was highly significant in case of all the
enzymes ( <*> greater than</*>>50 % ) , the enzymes hexokinase,
phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase showed a massive reduction of more than
70 % in all the epididymal segments after castration. </p> <O> Table 1 &

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#86:1>
However, in the vas deferns, the reduction of enzymes after
castration was moderate and restricted to a few enzymes only as compared to
epididymis ( Fig.5 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#87:1>
The enzymes phosphoglycerate mutase and glucose 6-phosphate

Replacement therapy by exogenous DHT in castrated monkeys
resulted in an approximately 50 % increase in the wet weight of epididymis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#90:1>
The increase in wet weight of individual segments was statistically
significant in initial segment ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.05 ) , caput (
P<*>smaller than</*>0.001 ) and corpus ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.01 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#91:1>
Vas deferens registered a 23 % increase in its wet weight which was
statistically nonsignificant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#92:1>
Total protein concentration did not change significantly after DHT
replacement in either the epididymal segments or the vas deferens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#93:1>
However, DNA concentration decreased significantly in the
epididymal segments and moderately in vas deferens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#94:1>
The enzyme activities were stimulated significantly after androgen
treatment in the epididymal segments, but the response of the four sements
was not similar.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#95:1>
Initial segment showed maximum stimulation of most of the enzyme
activities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#96:1>
The response of caput and corpus region was more or less similar.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#97:1>
However, in the cauda region the stimulation of enzyme activities
after DHT replacement was less marked as compared to the three proximal
segments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#98:1>
In the vas deferens the ensymes hexokinase, phosphoglycerate
kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase of glycolytic pathway and glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase of HMP pathway were the only enzymes which showed
some significant stimulation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#99:1>
</h> <bold> Discussion </bold> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#100:1>
The results obtained in the present study indicate that the
different segments of the epididymis which have been assigned distinct
functions do not differ significantly from each other in their energy
metabolism.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#101:1>
However, vas deferens differs markedly from the epididymis in the
activities of glycolytic and HMP pathway enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#102:1>
In general vas deferens showed a much larger glycolytic potential
but relatively lower pentose phosphate cycle activity as compared to the
epididymis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#103:1>
This may indicate a higher dependence of vas deferens on
carbohydrates for its energy requirements and a lower synthetic
activity in this part of the excurrent duct as compared to epididymis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#104:1>
The results suggest that a decrease in wet weight of the
epididymis in the androgen deficient state is <O> <&> page </&> 310 </O>
always accompanied by a simultaneous increase in DNA concentration and the
opposite effect is seen on replacement with exogenous androgen.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#105:1>
On the other hand, total protein concentration of epididymis
remains fairly constant in the different androgenic states of the animal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#106:1>
This indicates that changes in epididymal wet weight are not
accompanied by marked alterations in cell population of the epididymis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#107:1>
Previous studies in rat have shown that androgens have little
influence on either mitotic activity or DNA synthesis in the epididymis of
adult castrated <sp> <fnr> 17 </fnr> </sp> and intact <sp> <fnr> 18,19
</fnr> </sp> animals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#108:1>
However, total protein in epididymis appears to be a function of wet
weight and is changed in proportion to the changes in wet weight of the
tissue, and therefore, maintains its concentration constant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#109:1>
A significant decrease in the specific activities of all the
glycolytic and the two key enzymes of HMP pathway after castration indicate
that the synthesis and/or turnover of all these enyzmes is testicular
dependent in the epididymal cells.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#110:1>
However, it appears that the regulatory enzymes of glycolytic
path way ( hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase) and HMP pathway (
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase)
are affected more severely after castration as compared to the non-regulatory
enzymes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#111:1>
The exocrine secretions of the testis ( which includes
spermatozoa, androgen, proteins and other products ) reach the epididymis via
its efferent ducts whereas the endocrine secretions of testis reach
epididymis essentially via the systemic circulation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#112:1>
The replacement of the endocrine secretions of the testis in
castrated monkeys by exogenous DHT stimulated the activities of most of
the enzymes in the epididymal segments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#113:1>
However, none of the enzymes could reach its control level
indicating that either the peripheral androgens alone cannot restore the
normal functioning of the epididymis or it is due to any of the other reasons
( see below).

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#114:1>
The regulatory enzymes showed greater stimulation indicating their
greater dependence on testicular endocrine secretion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#115:1>
Functionally, epdidymis has been distinguished into two major
regions, a proximal region ( consist ing of initial segment, caput and
corpus) where spermatozoa undergo maturation and a distal region or cauda
where mature sperms are stored in a metabolically quiescent state <sp>
<fnr> 20 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#116:1>
Post-testicular maturation of sperm begins in the initial segment
and is completed by the time the spermatozoa reach the distal corpus region
<sp> <fnr> 9 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#117:1>
On the other hand sperm storage is a distinct physiological
entity and the sperm store ( cauda ) might be functionally quite separate
from other parts of the epidiymal duct <sp> <fnr> 20 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#118:1>
The results of the present study indicate that cauda does not differ
greatly from the proximal segments in the acivities of the enzymes of energy
metabolism but it is quite distinct from other segments in the androgenic
regulation of these enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#119:1>
While initial segment, caput and corpus showed good response to
exogenous androgen treatment in castrated animals the cauda showed only a
moderate response to such treatment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#120:1>
Poor response of cauda to androgen supplementation in
castrated animals may be due to a higher androgen threshold of this region as
compared to other regions of epididymis <sp> <fnr> 15 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#121:1>
In a study carried out in rat epididymis, it has been shown that the
time taken for the specific activity of cytosolic enzymes to reach a new
steady state after removal or supplementation of androgens was variable,
depending on the enzyme and the region of epidiymis <sp> <fnr> 21 </fnr>
</sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#122:1>
It is probable that in monkey epididymis the carbohydrate
metabolising enzymes require a longer time to reach new steady state in the
cauda after androgen supplementation and perhaps longer periods of treatment
or commencement of replacement therapy immediately after castration might
have stimulated the enzyme activities in this region better as seen in
other segments, or a higher dose of DHT could have induced a better response.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#123:1>
It is also pertinent to note that microquantites of estrogen
synergise with androgens in stimulating the acivites of the enzymes of
energy metabolism in rhesus monkey epididymis <sp> <fnr> 22 </fnr> </sp> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#124:1>
Thus, replacement with DHT alone may not be physiological enough to
restore epididymal metabolism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#125:1>
A comparison androgenic regulation of energy metabolism in the
vas deferens with that in the epididymis indicates that castration and
androgen supplementation in castrated animals affected glycolysis and
HMP pathway moderately in the vas defer<l.ens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#126:1>
This may indicate that the vas deferens is quite distinct from the
epididymis in the regulation of its energy metabolism by endocrine secretions
of testis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#127:1>
It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the four segments
of the epididymis differ significantly from the vas deferens in the acivities
and endocrine regulation of glycolytic and HMP pathway enzymes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#128:1>
However, the four segments do not differ significantly from each
other in the activities of these enzymes either in normal ( control) or in
castrated animals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#129:1>
But the stimulation of these enzymes by treatment with exogenous
androgens in castrated animals was maximum in the initial segment and
gradually decreased from caput to cauda region of epididymis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-027#130:1>
This study indicates a strict dependence of epididymal energy
metabolism on testicular androgens. <O> <&> page </&> 311 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#131:1>
Many epididymal functions which require energy ( e.g. absorption and
secretion ) are important for sperm maturation in this organ.

<ICE-IND:W2A-027#132:1>
The androgen dependence of sperm maturation may partly be due to
the androgen dependence of epididymal energy metabolism. </p>
