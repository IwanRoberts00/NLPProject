<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#4:1>
FACT I: It is estimated that more than 60% of houses in the port
town of Vasco da Gama are illegal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#5:1>
That they are constructed on encroached land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#6:1>
That most of them belong to lower middle class income or economically
weaker sections of the population.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#7:1>
That such constructions lead to ( and have led to) the sprouting of
slums and shanties with far reaching ominous consequences manifested in
deteriorating law and order situation etc.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#8:1>
That all this is because of the unavailability of reasonably priced
land and finance to the lower income group of people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#9:1>
FACT II: Goa is on the fast-lane of urban development.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#10:1>
Private real estate agents, constructors, brokers have never had
it so good.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#11:1>
Multi-floored constructions are cropping up in every available
open space.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#12:1>
Big names like <w> Rizvi's </w> too have made their debut in the
State.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#13:1>
As a result, land prices have shot up to the extent that only the
affluent can afford them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#14:1>
The National Commission on Urbanisation, a few years ago had in
its report, noted that Goa was developing too rapidly for the basic
infrastructure to keep pace. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#15:1>
The contrast is telling.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#16:1>
It may not have reached alarming proportions yet, but the trends are
clear enough to make any Government sit up with concern.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#17:1>
Goa is on the threshold of industrial development.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#18:1>
More and more industrial houses are showing interest in coming
to the State.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#19:1>
This means continued flow of migrant labour.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#20:1>
As it is, the Mormugao Port Trust and the Dock Labour Board are (
and probably will continue to be) major employers of migrant labour.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#21:1>
Where are these migrant citizens going to live? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#22:1>
It does not, of course, mean that the housing crisis that Goa
could face in the coming years would solely be due to the inflow of such
labour.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#23:1>
But like in Bombay, it can be a major cause.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#24:1>
It is also pertinent to mention here that almost 100% of such
labour comprises unskilled workers who, not being financially well off,
would be the residents of slums and shanties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#25:1>
The State Government has had ample time to study the problem and
formulate a housing policy.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#26:1>
However, it has not done anything concrete so far.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#27:1>
A few half-hearted attempts have been made but they lacked in
execution and produced negligible results.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#28:1>
There has been no serious move to coordinate the functioning of
agencies such as the Goa Housing Board, <foreign> communidades </foreign> ,
institutions providing housing finance such as the LIC, Housing Urban
Development Corporation and Cooperative banks in an attempt to formulate a
long term pragmatic policy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#29:1>
Nothing can better illustrate the <w> Government's </w> apathy
to the issue than the state of affairs in the Goa Housing Board since its
inception in 1967.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#30:1>
Established with the hallowed aim of providing quality low cost
houses to the economically weaker sections and lower middle income group of
people, the GHB was virtually non existent till Dr. M. Modassir took over
some two years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#31:1>
It constructed a miserable total of 1492 houses for the economically
weaker sections; 614 houses for the low income group; 526 houses for the
middle income groups and developed only 1438 plots.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#32:1>
It showed even lesser interest in fully utilising the paltry
grants received from the State Government ( incidentally given more of
compulsion than with a view to see the GHB flourish). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#33:1>
For instance, out of the Rs. 1.10 <indig> crore </indig>
sanctioned by the State for the year 1988-89, the Board could utilize only 50
<indig> lakhs </indig> ; the balance amount of Rs. 60 <indig> lakhs </indig>
thus lapsed!

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#34:1>
This is astonishing considering the scarcity of funds for
construction purposes and the urgent need for low cost housing.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#35:1>
The Government did not bother much about the complacency of the
premier housing institution, either. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#36:1>
Today, Dr. Modassir seems confident of tackling the problem.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#37:1>
While acknowledging that the Board had not lived up to its role, he
emphasised that since his takeover two years ago, things have turned for the
better.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#38:1>
<quote> " Our major problem is funds.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#39:1>
So, apart from the government, we are approaching agencies such as
HUDCO, GIC, Canfin etc," </quote> he informed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#40:1>
Out of the Rs. 125 <indig> lakhs </indig> sanctioned by the
Government for the year 1989-90 the GHB showed remarkable alacrity and
drew as much as Rs. 75 <indig> lakhs </indig> by July 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#41:1>
It approached the Housing Development Finance Corporation and
extracted a commitment from them for advancing Rs. 2.60 <indig> crore
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#42:1>
A proposal has already been submitted to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#43:1>
The Goa Housing Board has also approached the newly constituted
National Housing Bank for a loan of Rs. 4.23 <indig> crore </indig> , the
biggest ever asked by the Board so far.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#44:1>
<quote> " We intend to fully utilize the funds and make our presence
felt," </quote> Dr. Modassir stated confidently.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#45:1>
In addition, the Board also proposes to approach Canfin, the
housing-finance department of Canara Bank for a loan of Rs. 1.23 <indig>
crore </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#46:1>
But, will this sudden burst of enthusiasm be optimally utilized
by the Board, which at best, has remained non-functional? Dr. Modassir said
that the Board would soon be reconstituted and senior appointments made to
revitalize its functioning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#47:1>
The GHB also proposes to get into the construction of houses for
the upper-middle income group because <quote> " they are the ones who will
offset our subsidies extended to the other sections," </quote> said Dr.
Modassir. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#48:1>
<bold> Continued on page 3 </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#49:1>
<bold> Continued from page 2. </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#50:1>
The list of current activities of the Board and what it
proposes to do in the near future, is long.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#51:1>
That it will not be able to meet all the targets, is almost
certain.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#52:1>
One major constraint that the GHB faces in speedy implementation of
its schemes is the unavailability of reasonably priced land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#53:1>
This, incidentally, is a problem faced by other housing agencies
as well.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#54:1>
The Board cannot buy land without government sanction.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#55:1>
And, if it wishes to purchase land in the open market, it has to pay
through its nose.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#56:1>
Apart from <}> <-> governent </-> <+> government </+> </}> land, the
only avenue to acquire cheap land is the <foreign> Communidades </foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#57:1>
But, the Code of <foreign> Communidades </foreign> , which came into
effect on 15.4.1961 through a Diploma Legislative No: 2070, has set down
stringent conditions for selling <foreign> communidades </foreign> land.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#58:1>
<foreign> Communidade </foreign> land cannot be sold to
private parties or individuals except by auction.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#59:1>
This rule is waived off in case of cooperative societies or
landless persons.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#60:1>
However, if an individual wishing to construct a house wants to buy
land from the <foreign> communidade </foreign> , the sale is never <quote> "
out right" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#61:1>
The <foreign> communidades </foreign> gives him land on a lease of 20
years and only after he pays off the amount during the period, does he get
the sale-deed for the land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#62:1>
The result is that he cannot avail loan from either the bank or any
other financing institution for construction of the house because he
cannot produce the sale-deed of the land which is to act as security. </p>
<call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#63:1>
<bold> If housing in Goa is miserable, the affairs of the Goa Housing
Board have been no less so.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#64:1>
Just one example is enough: out of the Rs. 1.10 <indig> crore
</indig> sanctioned to it by the State Government for 1988-89, the Board
could utilise only Rs. 50 <indig> lakh </indig> , leaving Rs. 60 <indig> lakh
</indig> to lapse.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#65:1>
When, therefore, it is announced that the housing sector in the State
will be given a boost in the next two years through a variety of schemes
under the Housing Board involving an investment of Rs. 12 <indig> crore
</indig> , one doesn't know whether to feel elated or to laugh.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#66:1>
We are told by the <w> Board's </w> chairman, Vasu Paik Gaonkar, that
the current term of the people who run the Housing Board has almost come
to an end occasioning a reconstitution.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#67:1>
We feel like keeping our fingers crossed. </bold> </call-out>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#68:1>
<foreign> Communidade </foreign> rules do not stop at that.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#69:1>
If a person fails to cover 1/5th of the land he has leased from the
<foreign> communidade </foreign> by construction within four years of
taking possession, the land reverts back to the <foreign> communidade
</foreign> along with any partial construction done.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#70:1>
In other words, for four years, the possession is only provisional.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#71:1>
Of course, the person if he so wishes, can pay 20 years of the
lease rent in advance.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#72:1>
The question is: if he had that kind of money to spend at a go and
further invest in construction of the house, why would he approach <foreign>
communidades </foreign> with all this cumbersome procedures?

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#73:1>
He could go to a private real estate developer! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#74:1>
Recognizing the vast scope in the housing section in a
developing state like Goa, several housing finance agencies have begun
showing interest in the State, HUDCO, HDFC, LIC and Canara <w> Bank's </w>
Canfin, are among the many.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#75:1>
They do not seem to have made much of an impact, though.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#76:1>
One common refrain from all has been the <w> government's </w> lack
of response to their schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#77:1>
But the <w> State's </w> development commissioner, Mr R.S. Sethi
does not agree.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#78:1>
<quote> " Let them give viable proposals.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#79:1>
We will consider.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#80:1>
They should not talk in the air," </quote> he commented. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#81:1>
The senior Divisional Manager of Life Insurance Corporation, Mr.
K.K.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#82:1>
Krishnan, sees a big role for the housing finance schemes of the LIC
in revitalizing the housing sector in the state <quote> " provided the
government cooperates" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#83:1>
Mr. Krishnan finds the lack of availability of reasonably priced
land as the main constraint.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#84:1>
Senior LIC officers also expressed dissatisfaction at the <w>
government's </w> attitude to their policy-linked housing finance schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#85:1>
The LIC had forwarded a proposal to the government to undertake
the construction of a housing colony for those policy holders who
satisfied their terms and condition to qualify for an LIC loan.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#86:1>
The proposal required the Government to provide the LIC with
reasonably-priced land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#87:1>
( It pointed out that the LIC had constructed a similar colony in
Bangalore, Ahmedabad and some other cities.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#88:1>
But the proposal was turned down by the government which asked for
survey details as to how many policy holders were actually willing to
avail of the housing finance.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#89:1>
<quote> " This is ridiculous.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#90:1>
We have one <indig> lakh </indig> policy holders.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#91:1>
How can we survey all of them!" </quote> an LIC officer muttered.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#92:1>
An attempt was made at the housing seminar held in Panjim in May
last year to highlight the problems faced by housing development
authorities, both in the private and public sector and, broadly, eleven
suggestions were made to sort them out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#93:1>
There was near unanimity on the need to simplify procedures and
introduce a <quote> " single window system" </quote> for the clearance of all
formalities relating to the housing sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#94:1>
Non-availability of land at reasonable rates was another
important issue raised in the seminar.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#95:1>
The Goa branch of the Builders Association of India suggested that
if the Government could provide land at reasonable rates, houses with a
built-up area of about 40 sq.mts could be constructed for only Rs. 55,000
plus cost of the land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#96:1>
The Association expressed its willingness to provide the necessary
technical help and guidance to any agency executing the work. </p>

<w> Goa's </w> Development Commissioner, Mr R.S. Sethi, is an
acknowledged expert on the housing sector.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#103:1>
He has presented two very authoritative papers - - one titled
<quote> 'On Some Aspects of Housing in Europe' </quote> , in 1986 and the
other, <quote> 'Housing in Bangkok Metropolitan Area and Surroundings in
1987' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#104:1>
Mr. Sethi does not consider the present housing scenario in Goa
alarming, adding however, that a lot could be done.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#105:1>
Excerpts from an interview he gave to GOA POST: </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#106:1>
<h> ON THE VARIOUS SCHEMES OF INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS LIC, CANFIN, ETC
: </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#107:1>
They have approached us.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#108:1>
But the proposals are not concrete.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#109:1>
In the LIC case, since they want to construct a housing colony for
their policy-holders, we have asked them to purchase land from the open
market.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#110:1>
Why should we give them land at cheaper rates for the benefit of a
few of their policy holders!

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#111:1>
In any case, we had earlier asked them to conduct a survey and find
out if their scheme would draw adequate response from their policy holders.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#112:1>
They should not talk in the air. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#113:1>
<h> ON THE HOUSING POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#114:1>
The government is responsive to the demands of the housing
sector.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#115:1>
Land should be acquired in a locality where there is demand for
houses.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#116:1>
There is no point in constructing houses where there is no demand
and there is also lack of basic amenities such as electricity, water etc.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#117:1>
We would prefer to build self-contained housing colonies with
school, shopping, facilities, hospital etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#118:1>
We are willing to invest in viable housing schemes but they must
be linked with specific programmes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#119:1>
The Planning Commission has approved a sum of Rs. 1.40 <indig> crore

<h> ON THE FUNCTIONING OF GOA HOUSING BOARD </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#121:1>
The activities of the GHB have been sluggish.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#122:1>
Only recently have they begun working in earnest.

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#123:1>
While it continues to provide low-cost housing to the economically
weaker sections, they should auction plots and use the amount for
cross-subsidising their other activities. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#124:1>
<h> ON RISING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-019#125:1>
While laws have to be strictly enforced to prevent illegal
constructions, a cut-off date will have to be decided for those already
existing for the purpose of <}> <-> regularistation </-> <+> regularisation
</+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-019#126:1>
In Delhi, for instance, all illegal constructions which came up
prior to 1980 were regularised; others were deemed illegal. </p> </box>
