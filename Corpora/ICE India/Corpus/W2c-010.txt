<ICE-IND:W2C-010#4:1>
THE ironies piled up like a stack of newspapers rolling off the
press.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#5:1>
What the might of a vindictive Rajiv Gandhi regime could not achieve
in three years, was done by the management of the <it> Indian Express </it>
last fortnight.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#6:1>
It shut down its Delhi edition after the 750-member staff went on an
indefinite strike demanding implementation of the Bachawat Wage <w>
Board's </w> recommendations and other employee benefits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#7:1>
The action shifted from the noisy <it> Express </it> newsroom to
<w> Delhi's </w> Bahadur Shah Zafar <indig> Marg </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#8:1>
Reporters sat on the steps singing <it> <quote> " We shall overcome
one day" </quote> </it> instead of writing incisive, investigative stories
- - a hallmark of the newspaper.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#9:1>
Their vitriolic pens - - ever anti-establishment - - turned against
the <it> Express </it> empire.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#10:1>
Two slogans: <quote> " Our hearts beat for Bachawat; while their
money beeps in Bombay" </quote> and <quote> " Of what avail, the campaign
trails; the front page edits, if Bachawat fails" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#11:1>
The irony did not stop there.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#12:1>
Many leaders of the <indig> Janata Dal </indig> , whose political
battles were fought in the <it> Express </it> columns, supported the
striking workers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#13:1>
Doordarshan, which had ignored the <w> newspaper's </w> travails for
years, now gave wide coverage to the agitation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#14:1>
The management whispered that it was the handiwork of their enemies
who were still in the Government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#15:1>
A deadlock prevailed as both the union and the management stuck
to their guns.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#16:1>
The workers drew the support of almost all organisations of
journalists.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#17:1>
Said Indian Express <w> Employees' </w> Union General Secretary
Madan Talwar: <X> <quote> " The lock-out is illegal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#X18:1>
They are denying us our just rights." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#19:1>
<it> Express </it> financial adviser S. Gurumurthy, on the other
hand, argued that meeting the <w> employees' </w> demands will render the
group economically unviable.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#20:1>
Said he: <X> <quote> " We are already running an annual loss of Rs 4
<indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#X21:1>
The wage board implementation will mean a bill of Rs 2 <indig>
crore </indig> more.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#X22:1>
We will be sunk." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#23:1>
According to the wage board, the management has to pay its
employees by taking the group revenue as the base.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#24:1>
This means that the Delhi edition and other low-category editions
would fall in category one.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#25:1>
Gurumurthy complains that under the new method, the difference in
the <w> employees' </w> salaries in the Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat
editions will be considerable.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#26:1>
Though many news establishments have already implemented the wage
board award, major groups, like the <it> Times of India </it> , are irked by
this recommendation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#27:1>
Much to the <it> Express </it> <w> management's </w>
discomfiture, Labour Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has affirmed the <w>
Government's </w> commitment to implementing <w> Bachawat's </w>
recommendations.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#28:1>
The ultimate irony will be if the newspaper turns against the new
rulers for which it so tenaciously fought in the past.

Young turks led by Biman Bose challenge Jyoti Basu

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#33:2>
JYOTI Basu, who emerged as the <w> country's </w> kingmaker after
leading the Left Front to a near-sweep of the <indig> Lok Sabha </indig>
elections in West Bengal, is suddenly finding the rug being pulled from under
his feet in his own fiefdom.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#34:2>
The challenge, ironically, is being mounted by a protege. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#35:2>
Biman Bose, the strongman of the <w> party's </w> secretariat and
a member of its central committee, is sniping at the chief minister by
attacking a close associate, Calcutta Mayor Kamal Basu.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#36:2>
Bose, who was handpicked by late Promode Dasgupta from the <w>
student's </w> wing of the party, has risen to be the undisputed leader of
the <quote> 'young Turks' </quote> in the party.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#37:2>
And recently Bose did the unthinkable: cast aspersions on the mayor
over allocations of stalls in the rebuilt New Market complex in Calcutta (
the old S.S. Hogg Market, a landmark, was gutted in a yet unresolved mystery
fire on December 12, 1985).

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#38:2>
The snide remarks of Biman so enraged the mayor that he threatened to
resign his post in the first week of February.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#39:2>
Jyoti Basu, however, persuaded him to stay on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#40:2>
The raging intra-party feud can be traced to the market fire and
the subsequent reconstruction scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#41:2>
Within a month of the incident, Calcuttans were aware that the
Marxist city fathers and the then Marxist minister in charge of local
government and metropolitan development, Prasanta Sur who is now the health
minister, were in undue hurry to entrust the reconstruction work to a few
private promoters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#42:2>
Now, after five years, with a huge four-storeyed building having
come up, Biman Bose has ignited a political fire.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#43:2>
At a hurriedly convened press conference at the party
headquarters, Biman accused the civic authorities of violating contractual
norms while allotting space in the new block to stall owners affected by the
1985 fire.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#44:2>
He claimed that he had himself received 22 charges of irregularities
and cited two specific cases.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#45:2>
One of the fire-victims, who had a stall of 192 square feet, has been
allotted 184 square feet in the new block, and that too by the side of a
public urinal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#46:2>
And in the second case a person who earlier had a stall of 144 square
feet has been given only 78 square feet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#47:2>
Though Biman did not name names the target of his attack
obviously was Mayor Kamal Basu.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#48:2>
The <w> mayor's </w> quick reaction, dubbing the charges as <quote> "
baseless" </quote> and <quote> " untruthful" </quote> , only exposed the
infighting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#49:2>
The timing of <w> Biman's </w> onslaught is significant: it came
when party secretary and Left Front coordination committee chairman,
Saroj Mukherji, was on his death-bed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#50:2>
Apparently, the <quote> 'young turks' </quote> led by Biman were
raring to have a decisive say in party affairs hitherto run by Jyoti Basu
through a titular head like Mukherji. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#51:2>
The New Market deal perhaps is the best example of alleged unholy
nexus between the ruling clique and the promoters.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#52:2>
The civic authorities entrusted the rebuilding work to Martin Burn,
know being owned by developers K.N. Fatepuria and Associates.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#53:2>
The contract was that after accommodating the fire victims, the
promoters would have the right to sell the rest of the space, paying the
corporation a premium of Rs 1,080 per square metre. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#54:2>
And therein lay a prize catch: the original one-storeyed
structure now has four storeys.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#55:2>
Hence four times more space has been created on the same site.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#56:2>
The prevailing market price per square metre at New Market, according
to a very conservative estimate, is between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#57:2>
But then in this deal the corporation would get only Rs 104 <indig>
lakh </indig> while the promoters would raise anything between Rs 25
<indig> crore </indig> and Rs 32 <indig> crore </indig> from the leases and
thereby reap a profit of around Rs 25 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#58:2>
The cost of construction of the new block, according to a senior
officer of the building department of the corporation, would at the most
be Rs 250 <indig> lakh </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#59:2>
Questions have been raised on this but to no avail.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#60:2>
What Biman Bose and his group have realised is that the deal has
tarnished the image of the CPI(M) and diminished its prospect of returning to
power in the civic elections to be held in June. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#61:2>
But <w> Biman's </w> latest move clearly indicates that the
young turks are now hell-bent on weeding out the deadwood from all important
public positions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#62:2>
Incidentally, Biman Bose now enjoys an unassailable position and he
can dictate terms within the party forums especially because his personal
brigade includes such incorruptible stalwarts as Buddhadev Bhattacharya and
Anil Biswas, who, like Bose, are members of the state party secretariat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#63:2>
Now with Saroj <w> Mukherji's </w> passing, Biman and comrades
may be gearing themselves up to capture the party apparatus.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#64:2>
The die has been cast and a bitter power struggle between the old
guard and the young turks is on. </p>

<h> US plan to boost economy </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#67:3>
<h> Budget to spell crucial shift </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#68:3>
<@PR> WASHINGTON {#}, <@DR> Jan. 28 {#} ( <@SR> PTI {#}):
- - US President Bush's 1200 billion dollar budget for fiscal 1991 (
starting October 1, 1990) to be presented to Congress formally Monday, is
expected to shift the US priority for the first time since World War II from
fighting the cold war to competing on the economic front with West Germany
and Japan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#69:3>
Without mentioning these two emerging superpowers by name,
according to a summary of the budget documents published in advance in a
section of the press, Director of the White House office of management and
budget Richard G. Darman, who prepares the budget on behalf of President
Bush, says: <quote> " as the world moves away from an emphasis on the risk of
traditional military superpower conflict, the relative importance of US
economic strength only increases" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#70:3>
<quote> " Increased economic strength" </quote> , according to
the budget documents, <quote> " is essential to inspire and to assist
evolving lesser powers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#71:3>
And it is fundamental to success in the global competition with
rising economic superpowers" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#72:3>
Unlike in India and other countries which follow the British
tradition of secrecy until the budget is actually presented, leaks cause
some annoyance in official circles but nothing more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#73:3>
As taxes are the prerogative of Congress - - though the President
can make any proposals he likes - - and any tax proposals are debated
publicly by congressional committees before they are imposed or reduced,
budget leaks have no traumatic consequences on the stock market or in the
market place.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#74:3>
The budget in fact is given to correspondents before it is presented
to Congress. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#75:3>
If gearing up for the titanic economic struggle expected with
Germany and Japan is No. 1 priority, another priority of almost equal
dimensions is budget reduction, for which Bush, among other things, envisages
a <quote> " social security integrity and debt reduction fund" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#76:3>
The idea is to use social security surpluses which are piling up to
reduce the national debt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#77:3>
Bush also stresses the need for reducing the deficit and holding
down taxes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#78:3>
He reiterates his firm belief that less taxes will eventually result
in more tax receipts because they will enable the economy to expand. </p>

<@PR> NEW DELHI {#}, <@DR> Jan. 28 {#} ( <@SR> PTI {#}):
- - Campaigning for next month's assembly elections is yet to heat
up with most of the major parties still to finalise <w> candidates' </w>
lists and electoral adjustments while over 700 nominees have so far filed
their papers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#81:4>
Polling will be held on February 27 for the assemblies of
Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Pondicherry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#82:4>
Over 21.5 <indig> crore </indig> voters are expected to exercise
their franchise in these elections. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#83:4>
<h> At stake </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#84:4>
On February 12 Manipur Assembly will have its elections.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#85:4>
The number of seats at stake in the nine states and the Union
Territory of Pondicherry is 1679. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#86:4>
Meanwhile the talks on seat adjustments between the <indig>
Janata Dal </indig> and its allies in many states remained inconclusive.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#87:4>
While the party finalised its nominees for 206 out of 324 seats in
Bihar, the CPI leaders said that the Dal's adjustments with them was not
final as the Party has been offered just 40 seats much less than what it had
claimed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#88:4>
The <indig> Janata Dal </indig> is yet to arrive at a final
agreement with the <indig> Bharatiya Janata </indig> Party in Bihar, Gujarat,
Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#89:4>
But both the parties have come to an understanding in Himachal
Pradesh where the BJP will contest 51 seats and the <indig> Janata Dal
</indig> 17. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#90:4>
<h> Headway </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#91:4>
<bold> The BJP spokesman, Mr. Krishnalal Sharma said that a
<quote> " positive headway" </quote> has been made on seat adjustments in
Madhya Pradesh and Bihar between the two parties.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#92:4>
However, Gujarat remains a major bone of contention.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#93:4>
The BJP Chief Mr. L.K. Advani has openly criticised the <indig>
Janata Dal's </indig> demands in the state. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-010#94:4>
In Maharashtra the BJP has aligned itself with the <indig> Shiv
Sena </indig> and the <indig> Janata Dal </indig> is going it alone.

<ICE-IND:W2C-010#95:4>
The <indig> Bharatiya Janata </indig> Party will also have no
alliances in Manipur, Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Pondicherry. </p> </I>
