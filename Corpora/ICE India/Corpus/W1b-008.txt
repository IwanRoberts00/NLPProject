Dear Professor Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#7:1>
Thank you for your letter of 20 January. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#8:1>
I am glad to know that the Second Annual National Seminar of ELL  
Centres will be held at Kolhapur on 16 and 17 March ' 90. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#9:1>
The main focus of the Seminar should be on - 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#10:1>
( 1) the roles and functions of ELTCs 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#11:1>
( 2) creative and productive interaction between ELTCs and  
discipline-based Academic Staff Colleges </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#12:1>
I have noted that your Department will pay prof. Sethi his TA and  
DA. </p>

There is some personal problem at Patna. I may have to be at

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#91:2>
Dear Professor Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#92:2>
First of all, let me thank you very much for the opportunity you  
gave me for participating in your meeting on syllabus revision and presenting  
the <w> CDC's </w> point of view. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#93:2>
I am also very thankful to you personally for your warm hospitality. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#94:2>
Kindly convey my thanks to Mrs Shastri too. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#95:2>
Soon on my arrival here, I passed on a copy of the adversisement  
and one set of application forms to Dr Rani Rubdy. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#96:2>
Another copy of the advertisement has been given to the Registrar for  
display on the notice board. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#97:2>
I have informed Professor Verma that your ELTC Seminar will be  
held on 16-17 March. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#98:2>
He has noted it down. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#99:2>
The return journey from Kolhapur to Solapur was much worse, and  
it took a little longer too. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#100:2>
Considering this, another trip to Kolhapur by train-cum-bus may not  
be possible --- and certainly not in the heat of mid-March. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#101:2>
I suggest, therefore, that when you write to Professor SK Verma for  
my participation in the ELTCs Seminar, kindly request him to <ul> depute  
</ul> me officially just as the <mention> ELTCs </mention> will be deputing <ul> their </ul>  
Coordinators. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#102:2>
( I am the CIEFL Coordinator of the ELTCs programmes.) 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#103:2>
This will amount to the CIEFL deputing two persons in all, and that  
should not be difficult. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#104:2>
If, however, the CIEFL, in its response, expresses any difficulty in  
the matter, then kindly write again asking the CIEFL to at least top up the  
fares ( and DA) that your university can pay so as to make airtravel  
possible. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#105:2>
If that too fails, then your university should agree to pay for  
airtravel. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#106:2>
All this means that the exercise must start immediately so that even  
after the last round of correspondence, there is still enough time for me to  
book my travel both ways. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#107:2>
Would you like me to do anything else in regard to the  
advertisement for your ELTC post? </p>

Dear Professor Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#156:2>
For the last several days a small slip has been hanging beside my telephone. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#157:2>
It is dated 3.12.98, and it says : <quote> " Called Prof. Desai on 3-12-98. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#158:2>
He says that Prof. <w> Shastri's </w> article is going to be  
published in <ul> JEFL </ul> , 17th issue, which has already been sent to the  
Press. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#159:2>
Difficult to say how soon it will actually appear" </quote> . </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#160:2>
As per your earlier indications, I have since been waiting to  
hear from you in order to pass on this information - - this happy news. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#161:2>
So, now you can rest assured that the article is appearing soon,  
though one doesn't know how to define <quote> ` soon' </quote> . </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#162:2>
With quite some interest, I have read the article entitled  
<quote> ` The Design of the corpus' </quote> by Gerald Nelson. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#163:2>
The article does give fairly comprehensive information about what  
the ICE corpus consists of, but does not say <del> whether </del> what it (  
the corpus ) will be / is being exploited for. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#164:2>
Will it result in our international dictionary of English or  
something else / more? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#165:2>
With regard to the Indian English component of it, I am interested,  
chiefly, in two aspects of it - - pronounciation and usage. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#166:2>
I feel bad that a person as active as you should suffer from  
health problems. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#167:2>
In such cases what suffers, <del> gets affected </del> in terms is  
the health of meaningful professional work: at least its growth is slowed  
down. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-008#168:2>
You didn't say whether you agreed with me with regard to the  
Indian English Component of the new <ul> ALD </ul> ( fifth edition ) . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#169:2>
I don't think Indira Sengupta had any definition of <quote> ` Indian  
English' </quote> to go by. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#170:2>
( My reference here is to the review article I wrote on Dictionaries  
- - mainly two : <ul> Collins Cobuild </ul> and <ul> ALD </ul> ( 5th ed.) )  
</p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#171:2>
With regards to both of you <&> complimentary close in the middle  
</&> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-008#172:2>
Yours sincerely sd/- J.Sethi </I>
