<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#1:1:A>
Hello my name is <,> uh Biradar <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#2:1:B>
Hello <w> I'm </w> Mrs <,> Mamta Raybage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#3:1:B>
And we are having a discussion on todays children <,> and Maths <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#4:1:B>
So sir what you feel about uh <,,> todays children how they are in
Maths <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#5:1:A>
Uh childrens are okay <,> depends upon there <,,> coach <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#6:1:B>
Coach means they should be coached from <,> when they are in
nursery U K G itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#7:1:B>
The basic <,> of maths should be taught to them <,> means they
should be taught <,> in a funful way about the numbers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#8:1:B>
They should be introduced to the numbers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#9:1:B>
So that <w> they'll </w> make make might be <,> uh good in Maths
when they <,> go in the higher classes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#10:1:A>
Uh then it became this <,,> uh good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#11:1:A>
So then it became nice only otherwise <w> they'll </w> <,> didn't
follow <,> what is Maths <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#12:1:B>
No means uh <,,> I wanted <+> to </+> say that uh <,> they
should be taught the basics of Maths

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#13:1:B>
Now I teach in <,> fourth fifth and <,> sixth seventh standard
maths <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#14:1:B>
The children are not quite good in Maths <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#15:1:B>
But why they are not quite good <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#16:1:B>
What do you think <,> what more <,,> something else should be done
<,> so that there Maths <,> will become perfect <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#17:1:A>
Uh suddenly it will be <,> become perfect only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#18:1:A>
So <,,> it depend upon that <,,> uh their environment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#19:1:A>
And even home <-> did </-> condition also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#20:1:A>
If they be in always that this is <O> one word </O> there are <}>
<-> not improve </-> <+> no improvement </+> </}> only <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#21:1:B>
No means they don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#22:1:A>
No here I will not <,> uh that think that students are very
weak <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#23:1:A>
Actually they are good only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#24:1:A>
Uh if suppose sometimes if they will not <.> ge </.> <,> get good
<,> uhm diagrams or <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#25:1:B>
I see what actually I feel

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#26:1:A>
All the types only <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#27:1:B>
But even the bases <,> uhm for example <,> write in numbers
<,> write in figures <,> which they are taught from <,> first <,> standard
even <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> still they reach the fifth standard <,> they don't
know even the basics <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#28:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#29:1:A>
So <,> what we call to it here <,,> uh I Q <,> some students
having different different I Q <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#30:1:A>
So some some of them if you told one time <,> they are going to <,>
uh understand quick and some of them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#31:1:B>
For three years sir they are going in the same programme <,>
say from first second third fourth <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#32:1:A>
Ah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#33:1:B>
And till four years <,> a child <,> normal child <,> take any
normal child <,> if he doesn't know the difference between thousand <,> and
ten thousands and <indig> crore </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#34:1:B>
Atleast <,> the basic should be good <,> of maths <,> that is why
<,> if the basics are not at all proper how can they uh <,> do the eighth
ninth and tenth standard sums <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#35:1:B>
Addition subtractions are the basics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#36:1:B>
So what do you think about that <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#37:1:B>
What else efforts should be done <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#38:1:B>
No <w> I'm </w> asking you because

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#39:1:A>
Uhn that means here <,> actually they must do more practice
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#40:1:A>
By doing more <,> uhm either sums either that <,> uh writing <,> so
they <{> <[> are going </[> to improve

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#41:1:B>
<[> No uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#42:1:B>
For example take seventh standard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#43:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> teaching there Maths <,> but I take each and every sum
on the board

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#44:1:B>
I make the students do the sum on the board <,> but uh <,> I
finished my portion <-> in </-> ten to fifteen days earlier <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#45:1:B>
I take revision <,> but still there are <,> failures in Maths <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#46:1:B>
So you being a higher <,> uh this teacher <w> I'm </w> asking you
<,> you give me <}> <-> a </-> <+> the </+> </}> guidence on how should I
prepare the students for Maths <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#47:1:B>
Because <w> I'm </w> taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time
Maths <,,> so you give me <}> <-> a </-> <+> the </+> </}> guidence so that
<indig> na </indig> let the number of student failing be less <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#48:1:B>
I teach my best <,> because I take <,> each and every sum on the
board I make them solve on the board I take tests also I take revision also
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#49:1:B>
What else should I do <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#50:1:B>
One week I go on with only four to five lessons I have done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#51:1:B>
So what guidence <{> <[> you may give for that </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#52:1:A>
<[> No by doing more practice </[> </{> we can improve
otherwise only that one time it is not possible <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#53:1:B>
Means what else should I take <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#54:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> take <{> <[> tests also </[>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#55:1:B>
I have to take make them <,> I keep <,> <{> <[> I <,> competitions
between the girls and the boys also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#56:1:A>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#57:1:A>
<[> I </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#58:1:A>
Ah so <,> if it uh <,> if you teach that is in one day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#59:1:A>
So you can take out there again <,> give the same sums <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#60:1:A>
All type of students <,> some normal medium and <,> uh
extraordinary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#61:1:A>
The extraordinary they are going to <,> take up quick only <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#62:1:A>
And uh <.> med </.> medium class they can't understand <,> soon <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#63:1:A>
And you join with that one that uh <,> brilliant one that medium
<,> and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#64:1:A>
And suddenly they are going to improve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#65:1:A>
And we must do <,> uh like before that you told that regarding
competition <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> that is essential competition that <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#66:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#67:1:B>
No because I take competition between girls and the boys

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#68:1:B>
I make one boy solve if he doesn't no I make one girl solve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#69:1:B>
Let the competition spirit be between the both

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#70:1:B>
But even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them <,,>
still <,> in their paper they have done nil <,> might be my paper was hard
<,> because I didn't <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#71:1:A>
Ah now <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#72:1:B>
And I don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#73:1:A>
Papers we can't say hard only <,> because they already taught
that same <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#74:1:B>
No same matter I have taught only just I have <,> I jumbled up
the numbers here and there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#75:1:B>
All the sums were there in the text book itself <,,> but still they
have not done <,> properly in the exam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#76:1:B>
Now what else guidence should I <{1> <[1> give </[1> because <{2>
<[2> this week </[2> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#77:1:A>
<[1> Ah that </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#78:1:A>
<[2> In that case we </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#79:1:A>
In that case you must improve their <,> writing only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#80:1:A>
Writing and <,> uh uh <{> <[> exercise </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#81:1:B>
<[> Means </[> </{> they do the same exercise in classwork
they do the same exercise at homework <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#82:1:B>
They do it on the board also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#83:1:B>
Means what do you think that the basic itself is not <,,> good or
<,> now they are getting interest in maths <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#84:1:A>
No by doing these all <,> uh that means taking uh <,,> test
and uh that <,,> this way they are going to improve and we can't say within
that one month either <,> <{> <[> this two month they are going </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#85:1:B>
<[> Not one month </[> </{> now two to three months have
become the school has started we finished our first unit test also <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#86:1:A>
No afterwards that they are <.> impro </.> going to improve
suddenly <,> <O> laughs </O> so step by step <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#87:1:B>
Our fifth standard also is giving problem <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#88:1:B>
Do you know even they write <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#89:1:A>
Not even that fifth standard <,> so all the side <,> even
higher classes also the same problem <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#90:1:A>
Even if <w> we've </w> given many times they can't understand <,>
and if once <,> one time if they understood they are going to tell <,> soon
they are going to understand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#91:1:A>
When after that <,> one week either two weeks leave they can't <,>
<{> <[> again the excercise </[> because that means uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#92:1:B>
<[> <w> They'll </w> have <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#93:1:B>
Then

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#94:1:A>
Uh repetition is not there

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#95:1:A>
When we left <,> other that <,> four five days we even that <,> it
is <,> uh we can't tell express our views <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#96:1:B>
But how come we will be every time doing the same thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#97:1:B>
We have to complete our portion within time <,> isn't it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#98:1:B>
And again hammering the same and same and same sums we should
complete our portion also

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#99:1:B>
We should have <,> all the revision also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#100:1:B>
How is it possible sir <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#101:1:A>
So in only one week <,> daily we must do <,> one one sum <,>
on that all exercise <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#102:1:B>
Sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its
<,> uh possible to do <,> because in one week time <w> we're </w> having
seven period of maths <,> isn't it <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#103:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#104:1:B>
And in seven period atleast we should complete two to three
excercises <,,> in seven period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#105:1:B>
One exercise <,> teaching and doing the excercises and their
homework and their classwork <,> then assignments are also there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#106:1:B>
And completing this much is impossible sir

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#107:1:B>
Everytime to do one exercise one sum <indig> na </indig> <,> of
each exercise <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#108:1:A>
Even it is not possible by even <,> in school also

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#109:1:A>
But in home parents <,> they must take interest <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#110:1:B>
That is the main thing <indig> na </indig> here <,> that
would again the main thing that they don't take at all <,> interest in the
<,,> their children at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#111:1:B>
If both husband and wife are working husband should do <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#112:1:A>
No both not only husband

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#113:1:B>
He should help <indig> na </indig> <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#114:1:B>
He should help <{> <[> in their </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#115:1:A>
<[> Because if they </[> </{> are working both <,> they must
do both <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#116:1:A>
And it is not possible <,> uhm either that uh <,> one side only
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#117:1:A>
Either husband or <,> wife <,> who <,> who is getting that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#118:1:B>
But no sir when

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#119:1:A>
Time

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#120:1:B>
When both of them reach home okay <,> the first thing is the
wife should get up and make tea for her husband why <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#121:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not like <{> <[> that that </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#122:1:A>
<[> No that is </[> </{> not rule

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#123:1:B>
No no no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#124:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#125:1:B>
<w> It's </w> like that sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#126:1:B>
Never a husband says that <quote> <w> I'll </w> make a cup of tea
okay you sit <w> I'll </w> make a cup of tea </quote> never he says everytime
a wife should get up and make <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#127:1:B>
Both works same hours <,> isn't it ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#128:1:B>
Both of them are uh earning <,> <{> <[> ah <,> both of them are
earning for the same house

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#129:1:A>
<[> Ah I </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#130:1:A>
Okay it depend upon that even that wife also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#131:1:A>
If she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe
<,> and why if she she prepared and she can't give that <,> daily <w> I'm
</w> preparing this way that way <,> uh if <,> if she started like that only
saying then he will never do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#132:1:A>
Husband no <w> I'll </w> do <w> I'll </w> prepare it

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#133:1:A>
If she <,> told and uh suddenly <,> no with you so <w> I'll </w>
prepare he is going to say that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#134:1:A>
It depend upon their that uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#135:1:B>
But I don't think that any husband is <{1> <[1> willingly
saying that </[1> <,> that <w> I'll </w> come to <,> <quote> okay you sit for
a while <,> <w> I'll </w> uh prepare a cup of tea for you </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#136:1:B>
Indian husbands don't <{2> <[2> think like that you see </[2> so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#137:1:A>
<[1> No no it depend upon that </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#138:1:A>
<[2> No no don't don't <O> two words </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#139:1:A>
Uh not Indian husband that <,> depend upon that uh <O> one
word </O> woman <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#140:1:B>
No no <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#141:1:B>
It also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live <,,>
because when <,> husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't
work in the house <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#142:1:B>
My husband doesn't work at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#143:1:B>
He never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#144:1:B>
Sir sir you prepare tea <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#145:1:A>
Oh yes yes <,,> <O> laughter </O> I prepared as

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#146:1:B>
So your wife is quite lucky <indig> na </indig> having you as
a husband sir <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#147:1:A>
No that uh here was that <,> uhm understand between both the
<,,> husband and wife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#148:1:A>
And even she is helping that all at my <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#149:1:B>
In what <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#150:1:A>
Uh that uh in home even <,,> uh <O> one word </O> she is also
engaged in that uh <,> regarding home <,> uh uh <O> two words </O> this way
<,> so we two we help in that <{> <[> she is also get relax </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#151:1:B>
<[> No but they </[> </{> say <indig> na </indig> even now
<,> for example take that the husband doesn't work at all <,> okay <,> the
boys <O> one word </O> doesn't work at all

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#152:1:B>
And then he gets married <,,> okay <,> and he works <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#153:1:B>
And that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get
married you start working this and that and he stops <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#154:1:B>
Like that is also they do <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#155:1:A>
It may <,,> depend upon their <,,> parents <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#156:1:B>
No but why do the <,,> uh husbands again change a lot <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#157:1:A>
They never change <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#158:1:B>
They change sir how come you say like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#159:1:B>
When everytime <w> you're </w> no it is not possible for your
husband okay <,> to do the work

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#160:1:B>
He is also tired we are also tired isn't it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#161:1:B>
So for this we say sometime <,> to do something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#162:1:B>
I don't think that <,> he says generally <,> <quote> yes come on
<w> I'll </w> do it </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#163:1:B>
Some once in a while <,> once in a blue moon they help they say
that <quote> okay okay <w> I'll </w> do </quote> <,> but regularly a woman
have to work <,,> in the kitchen <,,> isn't it ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#164:1:A>
Actually that is Indian concept what you say that <,> uh uh
that <w> you'll </w> that <,,> man that <O> one word </O> that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#165:1:B>
Okay okay <,> Indian culture says that women should work <,>
<{> <[> yeah <,> isn't it ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#166:1:B>
She should cook she should look after the children <w> it's </w>
alright <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#167:1:B>
But even if they women <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> working
as much as a man <,> she is earning the same <,,> uh monthly saving <,> as a
man itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#168:1:B>
Then why should he not work at home <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#169:1:B>
Isn't it the ego of the <{> <[> man in which <w> I'm </w> trying
to <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#170:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#171:1:A>
<[> No he must work if they are </[> </{> working both the
side <,,> both husband and even she is <,> getting the same equivalent to him
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#172:1:A>
And there is no difference between a husband and wife because that
<,> that two are <,> equal weight only <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#173:1:B>
But they don't think <indig> na </indig> Indian society never
thinks that man and woman are equal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#174:1:B>
Ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for
the whole day <,> she has to look after the kitchen only alone <,> <O> laughs
</O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#175:1:C>
But don't you think that they are uh <,> changing now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#176:1:C>
This is changing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#177:1:B>
That only <w> I'm </w> saying sir but not uh <,,> only sir
<,> might be in a society <,> seventy-eight percent sir <,> or the in-laws
say that <,> <O> two words </O> <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#178:1:C>
See for example <,,> uh my wife <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> I mean
I do a lot of cooking <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> I enjoy it <w> that's </w> all
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#179:1:C>
But then now that <w> I've </w> become a little <,> old <,> <{3 
<[3> uhm <,> I feel it is difficult to do

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#180:1:C>
See I do my <O> one word </O> in the department <,> uh I do my
work <,> and when I come back in the <,> evening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#181:1:C>
And when I feel very tired I may even sleep <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#182:1:C>
So now <w> I'm </w> sixty-five <,> sixty-two now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#183:1:C>
But then you know when I was young <,,> I used to go <,,> uh I
mean my wife she does not work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#184:1:C>
She has not work <,> but she had four children <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-087#185:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-087#186:1:B>
