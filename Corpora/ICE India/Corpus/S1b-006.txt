We had <,> already learnt <,,> about <,,> the <,,> space flight
of Yuri Gagarin <,,> the pioneer in the field of uh <,> space <,> flight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#2:1:A>
We have come upto the launching of the spacecraft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#10:1:A>
How many days after the launching <,> the first and the second
stages of rockets <,,> had bend down and fallen away <,,> the spacecraft
projectory altered as I turned to go into orbit <,> parallel with the earth
<,,> surface <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#11:1:A>
Gagarin pulled himself towards the window <,,> <quote> I can see
the earth in a haze <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#12:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> feeling fine </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#13:1:A>
A moment later he added <,> <quote> It looks <,,> uh beautiful
</quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#14:1:A>
He was rather uh <,> startled and exasperated <,,> when he looked
through the window to the earth down below <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#15:1:A>
He says <quote> I can <,> see in a haze <,,> or it was not very
clear

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#16:1:A>
The vision was not very clear

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#17:1:A>
It was <,> murky or rather <,> uh foggy <,> or misty </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#18:1:A>
Therefore he says <quote> in spite of the fact that I can see the
earth <,,> in a haze

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#19:1:A>
It looks so beautiful </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#20:1:A>
He loosened the scarf holding him to his <,> couch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#21:1:A>
His body weightless in space <,> rose slightly above the seat <,>
though still held <,> uh loosened scarf <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#22:1:A>
He was in fact floating in his cabin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#23:1:A>
When he loosened his belt <,> he was floating in the <,> cabin <,,>
as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness <,> there in the outer
space

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#24:1:A>
Therefore he was <,> floating <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#25:1:A>
Every three or four minutes <,> he repeated his instrument reading
through the radio telephone <,> and received confirmation <,> from ground
control <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#26:1:A>
Straight in front of him <,> in his cabin was an instrument
panelled with the globe navigator <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#27:1:A>
A remarkable device which represented the earth below him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#28:1:A>
The globe slowly <,> resolved as his position altered <,> in
relation to the earth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#29:1:A>
Quite often he had to <,> come into contact with the earth station
<,> or it is otherwise known as the earth <,> controlling <,> station <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#30:1:A>
There was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#31:1:A>
He had to <,> observe the readings and the functions of this cabin
<,> and it has to be conveyed <,> through the telephone to the <,> uh ground
station <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#32:1:A>
And they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions <,>
what is to be done <,> uh how it should be done <,> so that he is always in
contact with the <,> uh earth station <,> though he is all alone <,> in the
<foreign> Vostok </foreign> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#33:1:A>
In the cabin <,> away from uh <,> the earth <,> hundreds of miles
<,> travelling at the tremendous speed of uh <,,> about eighty thousand uh
<,,> miles per hour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#34:1:A>
Still <,> he is in contact with <,,> the earth station <,,> and <,>
it is the two way <,> system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#35:1:A>
He will inform them <,> and they will accordingly <,> uh instruct
him <,> what is to be done and what not to be done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#36:1:A>
But the minutes after the launching <,> he was over South Africa
<,> South America <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#37:1:A>
<quote> All is well </quote> <,> he reported <,> <quote> I am not
too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#38:1:A>
The report was given to the world by way of Moscow radio <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#39:1:A>
Forty-six forty-five minutes after launching <,> he was just above
the South America <,> and he conveyed uh <,> to the earth station <,,> though
he experiences weightlessness <,,> fear of gravity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#40:1:A>
<quote> It does not cause any harm to him </quote> <,> and this
report was rather <,> broadcast by the Moscow radio <,> to all the <,>
peoples in Russia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#41:1:A>
A little later <,> the Atlantic was below him <,> just visible only
surface <,> and of course quite invisible <,> was the Russian tracking ship
<,> using <,> radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#42:1:A>
A little later he was above the Atlantic Ocean <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#43:1:A>
So he could see the <,,> sea <,,> or ocean clearly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#44:1:A>
He could not see the <,> tracking ship <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#45:1:A>
A ship was uh <,> equipped with radar <,> sophisticated uh <,,>
instruments to track the <,> uh course of uh <,> <w> Gagarin's </w> flight
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#46:1:A>
He could see the ocean clearly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#47:1:A>
Despite <,> he couldn't see the <,> ship which is uh <,> detailed
for tracking his <,,> uh flight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#48:1:A>
After just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast
of Africa <,> a red light in the instrument panel gleamed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#49:1:A>
This was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#50:1:A>
He checked the instruments <,> again and then reported that all was
well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#51:1:A>
While he was above <,> Africa <,> a red light was gleaming <,>
shining

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#52:1:A>
This was an indication <,> his return journey should start within a
short while <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#53:1:A>
<quote> Do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan
</quote> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#54:1:A>
He was asked <,> from the earth station <,> the ground control he
was asked <,> whether he would like to change any <,> uh change in the <,>
schedule of his or plan of his flight <,> whether he wants to remain in the
space for a <,> uh extended period <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#55:1:A>
<&> Cough </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#56:1:A>
He replied that <,,> he was not <,,> to be brought down as planned
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#57:1:A>
Sorry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#58:1:A>
He replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he
would <,> how nice to go round the world again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#59:1:A>
And although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in
case of any landing difficulty <,> Gagarin thought it best to keep to the <,>
prepared flight scheme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#60:1:A>
He informed the <,,> ground control <,,> though he would like to
continue <,> the flight for an extended period he wants uh <,,> everything
should be done according to the plan or the schedule <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#61:1:A>
Therefore he said that <,> <-> he is ready for </-> everything is
ready

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#62:1:A>
He checked <,> for the return journey <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#63:1:A>
At just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired
<,,> to slow off the spaceship <,> at the same time the cabin was turned to
exactly the right angle <,> for the entry of the earth atmosphere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#64:1:A>
This operations <,,> were dealt <,> with the <,,> <-> with </-> by
a computer on the ground <,> although in case the need Gagarin could have
used manual control <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#65:1:A>
Automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed
<,> and tearing off the <,,> uh spacecraft <,,> because <,> when it enters
the <,> atmos<,>phere <,> there is rather there is the line <,> imaginary
line <,> the outer space and the atmosphere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#66:1:A>
There was a lot of rather you see that <,> what you call that uh
<,> heat generated when the <.> space </.> <,> spacecraft re-enter our <,> uh
atmosphere

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#67:1:A>
That is why they <,> used to make the spacecraft with a particular
<,> uh metal which can resist or withstand the astronomical <,> amount of
heat produced

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#68:1:A>
Even then <,> uh <.> spa </.> cosmonauts astronauts are also <,> uh
made to wear a number of space suits <,,> to avoid any harm <,> when it re-
enters the <,> uh our atmosphere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#69:1:A>
So it was ready <,> retro<,>ket rocket that means for <,> receiving
coming back <,> automatically it was fired

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#70:1:A>
Everything was done by computer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#71:1:A>
Though there was the alternative provision for <,> Gagarin to
operate these things manually

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#72:1:A>
If something goes wrong <,> he has to come back to the earth

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#73:1:A>
Therefore they always keep the <,> contigency plan or alternative
arrangement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#74:1:A>
If everything goes smoothly the computer will operate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#75:1:A>
If the firing of the <,> rocket <,> from time to time <,> the
tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and <,> controlled by
the <,> earth <-> controlled </-> <,> station <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#76:1:A>
After this exactness <,> was record

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#77:1:A>
A very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many
miles <,> from that intended <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#78:1:A>
A slightly greater error <,> could result in a descent with a space
cabin <,> at the wrong angle and <w> it's </w> destruction by the heat
resulting from the air friction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#79:1:A>
It had to be done very meticulously <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#80:1:A>
Very uh <,> rather you see that uh <,,> uh exactly in the sense
very <,> with clinical precision <,,> precisely everything has to be done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#81:1:A>
A minor negligible error can cause uh <,> a tremendous uh rather
you see that <,> a damage which may cause the destruction of uh <,>
spacecraft and uh <,> cosmonaut <.> Gager </.> Gagarin himself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#82:1:A>
So everything has to be very precise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#83:1:A>
Gagarin felt the jolt <,> of the breaking rockets <,> gave the
shattereing rock <,> but the change was not violent as he has expected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#84:1:A>
He felt the sensation <,,> of weightlessness gradually leaving him
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#85:1:A>
As he started his returning journey <,,> the air brake was applied
he could feel the jolt

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#86:1:A>
Suddenly he was rather you see that uh <,> jolted or moved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#87:1:A>
And then he was feeling the <,> rather you see that the <,>
gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth <,,> the
weightlessness was rather vanishing <,> or on the decrease <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#88:1:A>
The pressure became stronger and stronger as the <foreign> Vostok
</foreign> descended <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#89:1:A>
His face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight
almost <,> in the flatness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#90:1:A>
The nose forced in the eye sockets widened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#91:1:A>
He could barely see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#92:1:A>
Speech was beyond him though his hearing remained <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#93:1:A>
The voice of the ground controller was saying that all was <,> well
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#94:1:A>
When that spacecraft the <foreign> Vostok </foreign> re-entered the
atmosphere <,,> for a few moments it was unbearable for him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#95:1:A>
His face was flattened <,> his eye sockets were <,> bulging and <,>
he could not even speak <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#96:1:A>
Only he could hear <,,> and he could hear the ground station was
telling <quote> everything was <,> going on smoothly after the schedule <,>
don't worry </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#97:1:A>
Otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh <,> few moments <,>
quite uncomforatable <,,> because his face was swollen or flattened <,> eyes
were bulging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#98:1:A>
He could not talk <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#99:1:A>
Restlessness he felt <,> drowsiness he felt <,> except he could <,>
uh hear <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#100:1:A>
The agonizing G-pressure lasted only a minute or two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#101:1:A>
Then it was lifted

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#102:1:A>
His weight became more normal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#103:1:A>
This unbearable and agonizing <-> the painful </-> <,> the most
painful experience lasted for two minutes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#104:1:A>
Then he was alright <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#105:1:A>
Above target <,> and on coast <,> parachute raised coming on it
was control system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#106:1:A>
Then again it was conveyed <quote> everything was <,> in perfect
trim perfect condition </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#107:1:A>
<&> Extended noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#108:1:A>
The voice prepared him for the physical shock <,> as the parachute
opened <,> above the capsule <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#109:1:A>
The slowing down of the <foreign> Vostok </foreign> was so abrupt
that it was like <,> a blow <,> in the church <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#110:1:A>
The spacecraft also is fitted with a <,> parachute <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#111:1:A>
We can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen
<,> thousand miles if <,> if it comes back to the earth at the same speed <,>
it will come and dash to the earth <,> to the destruction of uh <,>
spacecraft and occupant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#112:1:A>
Therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#113:1:A>
The <,> there was the parachute it was opened <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#114:1:A>
From the window he could now recognise <,> features of the land
below him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#115:1:A>
It was an old <,> training base in contrast with the rest of his
journey <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#116:1:A>
The descent was quite slow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#117:1:A>
But the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the <.>
consider </.> considerable speed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#118:1:A>
As he was coming down and down <,> descending flight <,> returning
flight <,> he could see the land <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#119:1:A>
It was an old discarded uh uh <,> training station there he was
going to land <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#120:1:A>
The final stages of the descent <,,> were first seen by <,> two
women <,,> working in the fields <,> of the widely spread parachute descended
<,> with the mysterious <,,> cabin suspended below it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#121:1:A>
The <w> woman's </w> first thought was that they were witnessing
the arrival of a spy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#122:1:A>
It was not very long since an American airman reconnoitre <,> high
over Russian territory had been brought down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#123:1:A>
The resulting neutral spy trend in Russia had got great sensation
<,> throughout the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#124:1:A>
When he was descending <,,> two women happened to see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#125:1:A>
They were rather frightened <,> because at that time the <,>
sensational uh <,> bringing down of the U-two plane <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#126:1:A>
U-two plane <-> is a it </-> was a <,> spy plane of America <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#127:1:A>
It <-> is </-> took <,> it took off from Pakistan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#128:1:A>
Uh it it could not be rather you see that <,> traceable unless a
country has got a sophisticated instruments <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#129:1:A>
If it flies over India we may not be able to know <,,> whether it
is flight of course now we are in a position

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#130:1:A>
In those days <,> you can imagine in sixties <,,> only uh Russia
or some advanced country could detect the <,> uh reconnoitre means spying
flight <,,> of this planes

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#131:1:A>
It is called U-two plane <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#132:1:A>
It took off from Pakistan because it is a close ally of <,> United
States

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#133:1:A>
Even today it is the close ally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#134:1:A>
So they allowed <,,> the planes the spy plane to take up
reconnoitre plane <,> or otherwise it is called espionage <,,> spying is
called <&> BB-Work </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#135:1:A>
This plane was on a mission to espionage <,> or spying <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#136:1:A>
Russians uh <,> could uh <,> detect the presence of this plane

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#137:1:A>
They brought down uh <,,> with a missile <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#138:1:A>
And the pilot was captured

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#139:1:A>
His <,> uh name uh <,> if I <,> <w> I'm </w> not wrong <,> uh
Powell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#140:1:A>
An air-force officer a pilot called Powell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#141:1:A>
He was imprisoned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#142:1:A>
After many years <,> with Americans and Russians negotiated and uh
<,> he was released <,> he was given his freedom <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#143:1:A>
In those days <,> this sensational news was spread all over Russia
<,> about the bringing down of uh <,,> U-two spy plane <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#144:1:A>
This woman the poor uneducated <,,> woman of the countryside <,>
took this as an Ameriacn spy plane <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#145:1:A>
They were rather frightened when this <,> spacecraft was coming
down with the parachute <,> over it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#146:1:A>
They mistook it for a <,> United States <,> or American spy planes
because <,> the news was uh <,> raging at that time <,> about the bringing
down of this U-two plane

<ICE-IND:S1B-006#147:1:A>
The spy <,> the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought
down <,,> </I>
