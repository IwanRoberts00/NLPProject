ABSTRACT

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#7:1>
This report provides an account on phytotoxic effects of
pesticides on pollen viability, germination and growth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#8:1>
Pollen were damaged and had reduced viability, germination and growth
on exposure to pesticides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#9:1>
The mechanism of inhibition of pollen germination and tube growth are
discussed. </p> <&> in two columns </&> <&> column one </&> <&> centered </&>

<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#11:1>
Development and activity of pollen are among the more sensitive
indicators of adverse factors in environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#12:1>
This led to the idea that the inhibited development and growth
potential of pollen grains can provide a convenient test system of monitoring
atmospheric pollutants ( Masaru et al., 1976; Pfahler, 1981; Mascarenhas,
1981; Varshney & Varshney, 1981 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#13:1>
However, scattered studies are available on the effects of
pesticides on pollen ( Shawa et al., 1966; Eaton & Chen, 1969; Gentile et
al., 1971, 1973; Dubey & Mall, 1972; Dubey, 1977; Dubey et al., 1984;
Soundarajan, 1984; Gupta & Khanna, 1981; Gupta & Beg, 1988; Bhardwaj et al.,
1989 ) , therefore, the present work was designated to provide an account of
pollen production and germination under the stress of pestcides. </p> <&>
centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#14:1>
<h> MATERIAL AND METHODS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#15:1>
Seeds of green gram PS-7 procured from Chandra Shekhar Azad
Agricultural University, Kanpur, were sown about 2 cm deep in the
experimental plots.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#16:1>
The plot size for each spray was 1.5 m<sp>2</sp> and randomized block
design was used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#17:1>
Endosulfan, a broad spectrum organochlorine insecticide of the
cyclodiene group manufactured by Excel Industries Ltd., Bombay under the
trade name Endocel-EC 35 was diluted so as to give a water suspension of 100,
500, 1000, 10,000 ppm concentrations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#18:1>
Two foliar spray were done with the help of Aspee hand operating
sprayer at 3rd leaf stage and flowering stage of the crop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#19:1>
Kapoor & Nair ( 1974 ) method was followed for studying the
pollen production capacity and staining with 1 % acetocarmine was used to
determine pollen viability.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#20:1>
Pollen germination and tube growth was recorded by sowing pollen
grains on sterilized cavity slide in a drop of basal culture media.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#21:1>
Prepared slides were later incubated in petri plates lined with moist
filter paper for 4 h at room temperature of 22-23 <*> degree</*> C and
relative <O> <&> page </&> 56 </O> humidity of 49-70 % under diffuse light.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#22:1>
After incubation, the pollen cultures were scanned under light
microscopes in ten fields ( 15 x 10 magnification ) to determine the
percentage of pollen germination and to measure the tube length by calibrated
ocular micrometer. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#23:1>
<h> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#24:1>
<h> ( a) <it> Pollen production </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#25:1>
Pollens are much more abundantly produced in anemophilous species
than in entomophilous species while hydrophilous species produced very scanty
pollen grains per plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#26:1>
Studies on pollen production capacity in pesticides treated plants
were not reported in the literature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#27:1>
However, our studies of both long and short stamens of <it> Vigna
radiata </it> on exposure to endosulfan have shown reduction in the pollen
production.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#28:1>
The pollen produced by long and short stamens were reduced to an
extent of 23 and 19 percent at 500 ppm, 43 and 50 % at 1000 ppm and 82 and 66
percent at 10,000 ppm dose levels of endosulfan ( Table 1 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#29:1>
These results provide an examples of adverse effect of pesticides on
pollen production in the field crops and so it is important to evaluate the
effect of pesticidal chemicals on different crops to single out the
susceptible species. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#30:1>
<h> ( b) <it> Pollen viability </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#31:1>
The pollen viability from control and endosulfan treated mungbean
plants was observed and it was found that the viability of pollen was
markedly reduced in long stamens. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#32:1>
<h> ( c) <it> Pollen germination and tube elongation </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#33:1>
Studies on the effects of commercial formulation of pesticides in
general, showed that the pollen were damaged by vapour of pesticides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#34:1>
Dubey & Mall ( 1972 ) <O> Table 1 </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page
</&> 57 </O> reported that the percentage of germination of viable pollen in
brinjal was reduced to 56 % on treatment with 1000 ppm of 2, 4-D, Soundarajan
( 1984 ) studied the effect of dimenthoate, fenevelorate, phosalone, methyl
demeton and endosulfan on pollen germination in okra and egg plant and
observed that the maximum drop in percentage germination was with endosulfan
and minimum with dimethoate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#35:1>
In strawberry, captan inhibited pollen germination <it> in vitro
</it> or when sprayed on anthers after dehiscence ( Daton & Chen, 1969 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#36:1>
Gentil et al. ( 1971, 1973, 1978 ) tested <it> in vitro </it> 32
commercial formulations of fungicides and insecticides for pollen
germination and tube growth to various degrees while topical application
of naled 58 % EC, formulated at 1000 ppm actual material, totally inhibited
the germination.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#37:1>
Further, seven applications of carbaryl or gardona to the silk of
sweet corn at 24 h interval cause a high incidence of malformed or missing
kernels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#38:1>
However, abnormalities of lesser degree were observed with fewer
application.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#39:1>
We also observed that there was a drop in percentage germination and
tube growth of pollen with increase in concentration of endosulfan in <it>
<foreign> Catharanthus roseus, Vigna radiata, Trigonella foenum-graecum and
Brassica campestris <foreign> . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#40:1>
The degree of inhibition was more severe in pollen tube growth
than in germination ( Gupta & Beg, 1988 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#41:1>
This observation supports the view that pollen germination and
tube growth are independent processes governed by separate set of conditions
and of the two, activation phase of pollen germination was less sensitive
to endosulfan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#42:1>
However, the mechanism of inhibition of pollen germination and tube
elongation is not clear at the moment but by equating with some of the known
phytotoxic effect of endosulfan on seed germination and seedling growth, a
plausible explanation may be offered.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#43:1>
Pesticide endosulfan is known to alter membrane permeability, cell
elongation and biosynthesis of protein and polysaccharide and so they may
be responsible for the inhibition in pollen germination and tube elongation
due to pesticides. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#44:1>
<h> ( d) <it> Effect on yield </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#45:1>
Shawa et al. ( 1966 ) studied the effect of commercial preparation of
four fungicides - - Captan, ferbam, maneb and phaltan on crnaberry pollen
germination, fruit set and yield and reported maximum reduction of yield in
case of phaltan followed by captan, maneb and ferbam. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#46:1>
<h> ( e) <it> Surfactants and pollen </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#47:1>
Surfactants are in variably incorporated in preparations of
pesticides to enhance penetration, retention time and effectiveness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#48:1>
Shivanna ( 1972 ) studied the effect of two non-ionic surfactants,
Tween-80 and Triton-100 on pollen grains of <it> Trigonella foenum-graecum
</it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#49:1>
The former did not effect <it> in vitro </it> germination and tube
growth, while the later drastically reduced both of these processes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#50:1>
Gentile et al. ( 1973 ) also observed strong inhibition in pollen
germination and tube growth in sweet corn treated with Trichlorfon-Dupont and
Trichlorfon multifilm-77 combination.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#51:1>
Pfahler et al. ( 1979 ) studied the effect of commercial
sticker-spreader Tween 80 and 114 individually in various concentrations on
<it> in vitro </it> pollen germination and tube elongation in three
genotypes of maize.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#52:1>
Increasing concentrations of Tween-80 had the least <O> <&> page </&>
58 </O> effect on pollen germination and tube growth while 114 had the
maximum effect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#53:1>
There was no germination when 114 was used above 10 mgl<sp>-1</sp>.

ABSTRACT

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#62:2>
Acid and alkaline phosphatase activities were estimated in
plasma, liver, kidney and testis after installation of Dimethoate for a
period of seven days on male toad.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#63:2>
ACP activity increased in plasma and kidney but decreased in liver
and testis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#64:2>
On the other hand ALP activity increased in liver and testis but
decreased in plasma and kidney.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#65:2>
Alteration of enzyme activities indicates that long exposure of this
systematic pesticide affects function of liver, kidney and testis. </p> <&>

<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#67:2>
Pesticides are widely used for control of pests.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#68:2>
This technique definitely helps to save crops against pest
infestation but a formidable possibility of biosphere pollution develops
leading to calamitous effects on non-target flora and fauna of various
ecosystems ( Warren, 1981 ) . </p> <O> <&> page </&> 60 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#69:2>
Toad ( <it> <foreign> Bufo melanostictus </foreign> </it> ) , an
anuran amphibia is a common animal in pond, lake, fields, etc. that plays a
very important role in biocontrol of pests in natural environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#70:2>
Tadpoles and toads destroy a large number of mosquito larvae and
other harmful aquatic insects.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#71:2>
On land, also, toads are active all day eating insects, many of which
are crop pest ( Atwal, 1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#72:2>
But such an important natural scavenger is continuously exposed to
different toxic chemicals sprayed in the field. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#73:2>
Dimethoate ( C<sb>5</sb>H<sb>12</sb>NO<sb>3</sb>PS ) , an
organophosphorus compound introduced in 1956 by the American Cyanamid
Company, is a systemic and contact phosphorothilothionate insecticide and
acaricide.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#74:2>
It is sold in India under the trade names Rogor, Dimethoate, Roxicon,
etc. as emulsifiable concentrate and the pesticide is extensively used by the
farmers ( Atwal, 1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#75:2>
The present work is aimed to estimate the range of tolerance and
alteration of metabolic profile in male toad by the effect of Dimethoate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#76:2>
Since most of the intermediary metabolites are phosphorylated
compounds, the phosphatases are important enzymes that play a key role in the
metabolism of the organism.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#77:2>
Among the various phosphatases present, <mention> ACP </mention> and
<mention> ALP </mention> have attained much significance ( Brown, 1964 )
although their exact physiological role has not yet been fully elucidated in
amphibian tissues. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#78:2>
<h> MATERIALS AND METHODS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#79:2>
Adult male non-hibernating toads, weighing 70 <*> plus or
minus</*> 10 g. were acclimatized in the laboratory conditions for one week
and maintained by force feeding with red <w> ants' </w> eggs on each day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#80:2>
pure dimethoate ( 90 % <it> a.i. </it> ) dissolved in propylene
glycol ( Schaffer, 1972 ) was orally instilled in the experimental group
whereas the control animals were fed with propylene glycol only.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#81:2>
As there was no reference on the LD<sb>50</sb> value of this
pesticides on toad, it was estimated according to the method of Litchfield &
Wilcoxon ( 1949 ) which is 90 mg / 100 g body wt ( Pradhan & Dasgupta, 1989 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#82:2>
Afterwards, the experimenal animals were orally instilled with
pesticide at effective dose of 45 mg / 100 g body wt. whereas the controls
were fed with vehicle only.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#83:2>
After 7 days of treatment, animals were sacrificed, blood was
collected in heparinised syringe, plasma separated by centrifugation and
stored immediately in 20 <*> degrees</*> C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#84:2>
Three important metabolically active organs-liver, kidney and testis
were dissected out, wiped dry and stored immediately at 20 <*> degrees</*>C
for biochemical analysis. Tissue pieces were weighed and homogenised in 0.25
M sucrose solution with a glass homogeniser maintained at 0-4 <*>
degrees</*>C for estimation of <mention> ACP </mention> & <mention> ALP
</mention> activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#85:2>
Activities of <mention> ACP </mention> & <mention> ALP </mention>
were estimated from plasma, liver, kidney and testis according to the
standard method ( Bergmeyer, 1963 ) using P-nitrophenyl phosphate as the
substrate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#86:2>
Cumulative data from the two groups was statistically analysed,
and standard error, <mention> t-test </mention> and calculation of <mention>
P-value </mention> were done to observe any significant variation of the
enzymes in ciontrol and treated groups. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#87:2>
<h> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#88:2>
More reports on the occurrence of normal values of these enzymes
have appeared <O> <&> page </&> 61 </O> <O> Table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#89:2>
Effect of dimethoate on acid and alkaline phosphatase activity in
plasma, liver, kidney and testis of male non-hibernating toad. </O> <O>
captions </O> than for any other single amphibian enzyme ( Brown, 1954 ) .
<mention> ACP </mention> & <mention> ALP </mention> activity has been
reported in adult Rana pipiens kidney, liver, heart, spleen and muscle ( Kind
& Macchi, 1952 ) . Longley ( 1955 ) in Ambystoma, Burgos ( 1955 ) in Rana
pipiens have histochemically demonstrated ACP & ALP activities in
different tissues. Alkaline phosphatase has also been measured in
H<sb>2</sb>O extracts of Ambystoma maxicanum and Xenopus laevis ( Krugelis,
1949-1951 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#90:2>
There is, however, very few records on the effect of pesticides
on the enzymatic pattern in amphibians.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#91:2>
So, most of the references in this regard have been considered fron
non-amphibians especially from the toxicological data on rats.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#92:2>
Because of the location of ACP & ALP in the plasma membrane of
cells of intestinal mucosa and kidney tubules, a possible role in active
transport mechanism has been suggested ( Danielli, 1952 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#93:2>
In mammals, osteoblast secretes large quantities of <mention> ALP
</mention> when they are actively depositing bone matrix, some of which
diffuses into blood ( Guyton, 1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#94:2>
Phosphatases also play important role in gluconeogenesis, glycogen
metabolism, synthesis of triacylglycerols and RNA sequencing ( Stryr, 1975 ) .
Phosphatases, in general, after being synthesized in the liver act in the
spleen, kidneys and other organs through the blood stream; although Kind &
Macchi ( 1952 ) showed that in Rana pipiens <mention> ACP </mention> &
<mention> ALP </mention> level in kidney is higher than any other organ of
the body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#95:2>
Table 1 shows that after the exposure to the pesticides, there is
significant increase of <mention> ACP </mention> in plasma and kidney with a
concomittant significant decrease in liver and testis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#96:2>
Decrease of <mention> ACP </mention> level in liver may be due to
hepatic cytolysis causing release of lysosomal enzymes in blood resulting in
an increase in plasma <mention> ACP </mention> which is probably transported
to kidney for increased excretory <O> <&> page </&> 62 </O> activity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#97:2>
Decrease of ACP level in testis reflects that metabolism of
phosphorylated compounds is interfered by the effect of pesticide which may
render ultimate effect on anomalies of reproductive physiology as in rats, (
Dasgupta et al., 1989 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#98:2>
Table 1 also shows that there was a significant decrease of ALP
in plasma and kidney but significant increase in liver and testis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#99:2>
Increase of <mention> ALP </mention> activity in liver may be due to
obstruction in the release of the enzyme from the liver or may be due to
increase in enzyme protein synthesis as a response to toxic effect of the
pesticide.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#100:2>
However, decrease of ALP level in blood reflects that less release
of enzyme from the liver may be a more plausible explanation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#101:2>
Consequently kidney <mention> ALP </mention> activity also decreased
as the enzyme is transported from liver to kidney through the blood stream.

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#102:2>
In rat, testicular <mention> ALP </mention> plays an important role
in spermatogenesis, testicular harmone synthesis and intermediate
carbohydrate metabolism of fructose ( Davis & Longford, 1970 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#103:2>
In toad, of course, this has not been elucidated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-026#104:2>
Damethoate, being a systemic pesticide possesses greater
stabiliy in the organ systems of animals and plants ( Atwal, 1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-026#105:2>
The liver is highly affected by the oral instillation of
pesticide and as it is the primary source of <mention> ACP </mention> and
<mention> ALP </mention> , it may be supposed that metabolic disorder in
liver results in altered enzymatic activity in plasma, kidney and testis
causing a possible impairment of intermediary metabolism of phosphorylated
compounds. </p> <&> centered </&>
