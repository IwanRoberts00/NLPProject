In the last two years she had become very flat <,> and uh <,>
in the last academic year for uh one term she didn't run at all <,>

So she used to give us uh hundred <indig> rupees </indig> per month

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#90:1:A>
Uh she was running also on only two days <,>

But uh this <,> uh academy is running the classes uh in number of
<,> <{> <[> institution <,> we use it only for

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#92:1:B>
<[> Institution </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#93:1:B>
There is nothing wrong I tell you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#94:1:B>
This is an institution

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#95:1:A>
Nothing serious that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#96:1:B>
But you see we can get funds

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#97:1:A>
Compensation

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#98:1:B>
Like borrow steal <{> <[> sometime </[> if it is necessary
steal you steal it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#99:1:A>
<[> This is a </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#100:1:A>
Yeah this is the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#101:1:B>
For building the institution <,> <{> <[> yeah and <,> but not
to put in <w> anybody's </w> pocket

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#102:1:A>
<[> Yeah and </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#103:1:A>
Uhn this <,> now <,> uh Mr <,> Ambujaksan he runs classes in
<,> uh large number of schools here <O> cough </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#104:1:A>
He has got trained uh teachers <,> and he also has classes in
Bhandup <,> and all that he had approached us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#105:1:A>
Now Committee last time in the <,> discussion they said minimum
three thousand you should try to ask <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#106:1:A>
Now Vice- Chairman was here and uh <,> H M was here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#107:1:A>
He called him he said initial years <,> uh I don't know what is
the response <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#108:1:A>
So let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred <,> and
from next year uh we will see <,> how whether we can pay more

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#109:1:A>
So <,> it is uh or we have agreed <,> and the classes have started
and uh <,> parents uh <,> some twenty thirty parents have <,> already
registered

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#110:1:A>
The classes <-> are </-> run on <,> Saturday and Sunday without
affecting uh <,> working of the school <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#111:1:A>
Then uh <,> initially we have made the enquiry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#112:1:A>
But we have not <,> uh uh still taken action and in due course we
will take action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#113:1:A>
And uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#114:1:B>
Uh I would I would suggest <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> one attitude
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#115:1:B>
Uh in Fort area <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> there is one Sardarji he is
a good assembler <,> and uh good service also <,> <{3> <[3> uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#116:1:B>
Atleast last twenty years <,,> in our whole building most of us
are using that assembled one <,> <{4> <[4> uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#117:1:B>
Actually he makes the whole thing <,> <{5> <[5> uhm <,> for your
Voltas also <-> have </-> he has given <,> <{6> <[6> yeah <,> to them

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#118:1:B>
And Voltas only puts their <,> level endowing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#119:1:B>
So therefore you can also consult Krishnan <,> <{7> <[7> yeah <,>
for the price and other thing <O> one word </O> <,> and only thing is known
devil is better <{> <[> than </[> the unknown devil <w> that's </w>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#120:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#121:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#122:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#123:1:A>
<[4> Uhm uhm </[4> </{4>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#124:1:A>
<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#125:1:A>
<[6> Yeah </[6> </{6>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#126:1:A>
<[7> Yeah </[7> </{7>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#127:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#128:1:A>
No here <,> we have got quotations for about twenty thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#129:1:B>
Known people <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#130:1:A>
Known <,> uh both the both parties are known <,> and Voltas
is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#131:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> a lot

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#132:1:A>
The discussion was <,> to find out from these uh <,,>
assembled persons <,> whether during the service which is free <,> one year
guarantee is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#133:1:A>
Parts are also free <,> or whether we have to pay

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#134:1:A>
Somehow I had not been able to <,> ask them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#135:1:B>
It is free service <{> <[> minus the part </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#136:1:A>
<[> Include the part </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-073#137:1:A>
That confirmation we wanted <,> committee wanted and that I
have not been able to do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#138:1:A>
Uh so that is <,> and this uh <,> you see <,> uh we decided to
open the account <,> uh for computer education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#139:1:A>
Now little bit of background is necessary for <,> some members
office bearers are fully aware <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#140:1:A>
Now last year <,> we had agreed uh <,,> according to the contract
<,> to collect the fees ourselves <,,> and uh then uh <,> transfer their
share to <,> the party <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#141:1:A>
Somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and <,> the
the <,> <O> one word </O> collected the fees <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#142:1:A>
Then uh <,> <-> we </-> <,,> our contribution uh <,> actually came
back to us after lot of correspondence and <,> then uh <,> we wrote finally a
letter in May <,> asking the party to see us <,> along with the <,> <{> <[>
cheque <,> cheque and uh <,,> that day all the office bearers were here and H
M was there

<ICE-IND:S1B-073#143:1:A>
