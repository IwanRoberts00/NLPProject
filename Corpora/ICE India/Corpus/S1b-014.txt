<ICE-IND:S1B-014#1:1>
Begin the chapter <mention> The Indian Constitution </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#2:1>
In that we will be seeing the salient <,> features of the Indian
Constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#3:1>
Uh <,,> we know that India was not free <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#4:1>
Nineteen forty-seven <,> August fifteen <,> India became free <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#5:1>
But along with freedom <,> we needed some <,,> framework of laws <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#6:1>
Laws and bye-laws for <,,> a better government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#7:1>
The British had laws but they were laws more favourable to them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#8:1>
So therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to <,> us

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#9:1>
Therefore we will see <,> the chapter <,,> <mention> the Indian
Constitution </mention> <,,> <&> Cough </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#10:1>
When we talk about <,,> the Indian Constitution <,,> we are talking
about <,,> the ideals of the freedom-fighters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#11:1>
The ideals of the people <,,> the ideals of the people around the
world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#12:1>
That is why <,,> we are going to see in this chapter <,> what are the
ideals ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#13:1>
Or what are the ideas upon which <,> our laws or our bye-laws <,> or
our constitution is based ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#14:1>
Therefore we will consider <,> the salient features of the Indian
Constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#15:1>
In nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six <,> we had the <,,>
Constituent Assembly <,,> or a group of people <,> who would be studying the
various constitutions of the world <,> and then formulating a constitution
<,> based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own
constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#16:1>
The Constituent Assembly was the large body

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#17:1>
It was not possible <,> that uh <,> all people would take part <,> uh
in the actual work of framing the constitution

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#18:1>
Therefore a smaller body was formed <,> a smaller body was <,> taken
<,> known as the drafting committee <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#19:1>
The drafting committee <,> had a specific task <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#20:1>
The drafting committee had a specific task

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#21:1>
Number one <,,> of studying the constitutions of the world and number
two <,> of <,> forming or creating a draft of our constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#22:1>
What we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#23:1>
No <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#24:1>
It could have changed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#25:1>
Therefore they made <,,> a a draft so that we could study the
Constituent Assembly could study the draft and then if they required they
would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#26:1>
The chairman of the drafting committee was Dr <,> B R Ambedkar <,>
and it had <-> a </-> various members on it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#27:1>
Dr B R Ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#28:1>
He was uh <,> good at law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#29:1>
He had studied abroad <,,> uh he was an individual who was <,>
interested in uh <,> the upliftment of the poor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#30:1>
He was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the
movement <,> the national movement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#31:1>
And therefore he was chosen as the <,> uh the chairman for the
drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft <,> studying the
various constitutions of the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#32:1>
Therefore the drafting committee collected the work <,> of drafting
the constitution and placing it before the Constituent Assembly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#33:1>
The Constituent Assembly published the constitution the draft of the
constitution throughout India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#34:1>
All the members of the Constituent Assembly studied the draft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#35:1>
All the members of the drafting committees studied the draft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#36:1>
All the eminent people in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#37:1>
All the teachers <,> and those who were really interested in the real
ideals and the future of the country studied the draft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#38:1>
And there was a provision that any individual who thought fit <,>
that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the
Constituent Assembly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#39:1>
They made their remarks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#40:1>
They said something in favour and somethings against <,> a particular
clause of the draft <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#41:1>
Therefore <,> with this process of bringing out a change for the
better finally the Constituent Assembly took into consideration all these
suggestions <,> and made the Constitution of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#42:1>
The Constitution of India was formulated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#43:1>
The Constitution of India was applied <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#44:1>
The Constitution of India is in use <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#45:1>
But many a times we don't realize <,> its important

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#46:1>
We don't realize its salient features <,> <}> <-> in our </-> <,> <=>
in other </=> </}> words important <,,> essential features of the
Constitution

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#47:1>
And therefore we don't realize its importance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#48:1>
We know it is there

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#49:1>
But if we do not know what is in there ? <&> Cough </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#50:1>
So <w> we'll </w> consider <,> some of the salient features of the
Indian Constitution <,> Constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#51:1>
The first thing that we will consider <,> is <,> the preamble <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#52:1>
Preamble is the most important part of the Indian Constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#53:1>
We could consider it as a <,> a <,> a magnacarta <,> of the <}> <->
India </-> <,> <=> Indian </=> </}> Constitution

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#54:1>
We could consider it as an important introduction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#55:1>
<}> <-> We will </-> <=> we could </=> </}> consider it as an
important uh <,> core of the Constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#56:1>
Why because <,> in the preamble lies the important principles for
which <,> India uh <,> is known for <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#57:1>
For which the Constitution was made <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#58:1>
For which the people of India fought <,> for which we live <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#59:1>
Therefore the preamble is very <,> very important <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#60:1>
Now we will see what is there in the preamble <,> for us to jot down
<,> note <,> offered to observe or study <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#61:1>
Number one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#62:1>
The main thing that is stressed in the preamble <,> is <,,> the
soverrignty of the people in the world we <,,> <quote> We <,> the people of
India </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#63:1>
We the people of India <,> formulate the constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#64:1>
We the people of India make and <,> adopt <,> the constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#65:1>
We the people of India have these ideas <,> uh in our constitution
therefore it is not <,> I <,,> previously we had monarchy <,,> a King would
have his own constitution <,> at his uh <,> whims and fancies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#66:1>
He would have a constitution <,> and based on that the country would
be ruled

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#67:1>
But sometimes <,> even they wouldn't follow what was said <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#68:1>
They would change <,,> constitution would change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#69:1>
The people would change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#70:1>
And therefore it was I <,> I the king <,,> or I the Queen declares
such and such a thing

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#71:1>
There was nothing <,> uh any more like that to be

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#72:1>
Therefore we the people <,,> we declared to ourselves <,> we adopt
the constitution we <,> have these ideals for ourselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#73:1>
That is why <,> the power of the people is very much imposed <,> in
we <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#74:1>
And <w> that's </w> a very important aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#75:1>
Never before in India was such a principle stipulated

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#76:1>
That is the basis of democracy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#77:1>
We <,> <w> that's </w> basis of uh <,> our functioning now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#78:1>
It was not there before

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#79:1>
But it happened <,> when we became free

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#80:1>
Therefore the sovereignty <,> of the people was established <,> or
made <,> clear <,> in the preamble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#81:1>
The second point that we see <,,> are the different principles that
are enshrined <,> uh in the uh preamble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#82:1>
Enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble <,> stipulated in
the preamble <,,> uh put forth in the preamble

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#83:1>
And those principles are <,> sovereign <,> <&> cough </&> socialist
<,> secular <,> democratic <,> republic

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#84:1>
<}> <- > India to be </-> <,> <=> India to be </=> </}> <,> a
sovereign <,> socialist <,> secular <,> democratic <,> republic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#85:1>
Now we will see what every word <,> means <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#86:1>
So that we will have a better understanding <,> of uh <,> the
preamble <,> and also of these basic principles which are there in the
preamble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#87:1>
Sovereign

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#88:1>
When we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence
India was not sovereign <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#89:1>
In other words India was not free <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#90:1>
In other words someone else was ruling <,,> on our territory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#91:1>
In other words the <}> <-> <.> pre </.> </-> <=> people </=> </}>
were the subject <,> and the rulers were someone else <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#92:1>
Also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their
own government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#93:1>
There was one monarchy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#94:1>
So all that was there prior to independence was different <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#95:1>
Therefore India was declared to be sovereign <,> indicating that <,>
India is free <,> indicating that no other country has any power over India
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#96:1>
Indicating that <,> India is free to make its own laws and its own
constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#97:1>
That is why that word sovereign <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#98:1>
Sovereign means <,> all powerful <,> all powerful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#99:1>
So it very plainly lays down <,> the principle of India being free
<,> India being independent <,> and that was very essential for us

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#100:1>
That is why the people <,> or the freedom fighters fought for

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#101:1>
They wanted to be free <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#102:1>
They were not going to be satisfied with anything short of <,>
sovereignty

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#103:1>
Therefore the first principle of being sovereign <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#104:1>
When we talk of the word socialist <,> or socialism <,,> there was
socialism in the world uh <,> when India was striving for freedom <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#105:1>
Socialism in Russia <,> socialism in China <,> and other parts of
the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#106:1>
Socialism was uh <,,> stipulating or bringing out the idea that all
people are equal and therefore <,> the property <,> the land and the wealth
of the country must be divided equally <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#107:1>
In that everything belongs to the state <,> and nothing belongs to
an individual <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#108:1>
Therefore socialism because of <w> India's </w> <,> specific
condition <,> because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic
in those days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#109:1>
Therefore socialism was liken by the people of India

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#110:1>
And therefore it was framed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#111:1>
But the socialism that we adopted was not <,> that of Russia or
China <,> or not that kind <,,> where everything was owned by the nation <,>
where everything was nationalized <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#112:1>
Nothing was private <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#113:1>
It was of that kind of socialism that we adopted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#114:1>
The <,> the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar
kind of socialism that we had <,> was mixed economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#115:1>
Mixed economy means <,> that part of the economic activity in India
<,> would be nationalized <,> and part of the economic activity in India
would be private <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#116:1>
Therefore all those important industries which are of national
benefit <,> are nationalized <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#117:1>
Banks are nationalized <,> mines are nationalized <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#118:1>
All wealth of nations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#119:1>
Therefore those railways <,> are natioanlized

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#120:1>
They are the wealth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#121:1>
They are for the importance of all the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#122:1>
They are for the need of all the people

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#123:1>
Therefore those uh <,> industries or that part of the economy which
is required by all is nationalized <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#124:1>
And that part <,> which uh <,> remains in the hands of the private
people

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#125:1>
There are some industries which belong to the private people

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#126:1>
So therefore we have a mixed <}> <-> <.> eco </.> </-> <=> economy
</=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#127:1>
Nationalised economy <,> and private economy

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#128:1>
So our kind of socialism is not that which is <,> likened to the
socialism in Russia <,> or in China <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#129:1>
Secular is the <}> <-> next </-> <=> next </=> </}> <,> uh ideal
that we have chosen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#130:1>
Secular or secularism <,,> we might wonder what it is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#131:1>
There are a few countries <,> in the world <,> which have a state
religion <,,> specially in the middle-east <,,> there is the state religion
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#132:1>
But there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have
a state religion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#133:1>
India was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen
forty-seven <,> where there were important <,> major religions in India <,,>
Jainism <,> Buddhism <,> Hinduism <,> Sikhism <,> Christianity and so on and
so forth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#134:1>
Now in a situation like this <,> the leaders were confronted with a
dilemma <,> or problem <,> where they didn't know what to decide <,,> or
which religion should get importance <,> though there was a Hindu majority
<,> there was a Muslim minority there was a Christian minority <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#135:1>
Therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#136:1>
So they opted for a secular state <,> indicating that India <,> will
not <,> propogate <,> any state religion <,> that India is <,> secular state
<,,> that India will not be biased <,,> to favour one religion <,,> and not
favour the other

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#137:1>
Therefore <,,> all religions are equal in the eyes of the state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#138:1>
No religion is more important than the other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#139:1>
Does not matter whether it has the majority <,> or a minority of
followers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#140:1>
Therefore this ideal <,> of secularism was very favourable so that
all could survive <,> within India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#141:1>
So that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for
centuries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#142:1>
The Hindus and the Muslims <,> the Hindus Muslims and the Christians
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#143:1>
These Hindus Muslims Christians Jains and the Buddhists <,> had been
surviving for the centuries <,> together and therefore it was thought that
they would continue to stay <,> in a secular state together as they had been
doing before <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#144:1>
The next ideal that we have <,> is democratic republic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#145:1>
Democracy as defined by <,> Abraham Lincoln <,> <quote> <w> it's
</w> a form of government <,> where the power lies with the <,> people <,,>
<w> it's </w> a <,> form of govrnment <,> which is <,> of the people <,> by
the people <,> and for the people </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#146:1>
<}> <-> A very a very uh </-> <=> a very </=> </}> ideal thought <,>
a very ideal uh type of government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#147:1>
Therefore whatever is done the people are responsible <,> whatever
is decided the people are responsible <,> because it is for the benefit of
the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#148:1>
And the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people
<,> uh with the method of election <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#149:1>
So a very ideal pattern that was choosen for India was democracy
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#150:1>
Socialism was there <,> <}> <-> a very <,> a very <,> </-> <=> a
very </=> </}> uh <,> likeable ideal <,> because there was a <,> a difference
of rich and poor in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#151:1>
If socialism <,> uh if socialism was adopted in India as it was in
Russia or China perhaps the <}> <-> country </-> <=> country </=> </}> could
have been made economically different <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#152:1>
But in other matters it would have been different

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#153:1>
Therefore <,> they chose democratic republic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#154:1>
We were free <,> and we will rule <,> the country that is why we the
people the sovereignty of the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#155:1>
Republic in that we had our own constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#156:1>
We did not mean the <,> uh the <,,> constitution of another country
to rule us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#157:1>
But we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic
republic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#158:1>
Therefore <w> it's </w> a very balanced view that of the
constitution that we get in the preamble

<ICE-IND:S1B-014#159:1>
We the people rule the country and <,> those principles which will
make India a strong state is sovereign <,> secular <,> socialist <,>
democratic <,> republic <,,> </I>
