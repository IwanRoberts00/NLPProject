Question number one forty-three <indig> Shri </indig> Chitto
Basu <,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X2:1:A>
( a) Whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent
growth rate during the current year <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X3:1:A>
( b) Whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted
growth rate during the current financial year <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X4:1:A>
( c) If so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the
last year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X5:1:A>
( d) The reasons for poor growth rate of exports <,> and ( e) <,>
the steps taken to remedy the situation </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#6:1:A>
Sir question one four three <,,> the statement is laid on the
table of the house <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#7:1:B>
Sir <,> uh from the statement <,> it appears <,> uh that there
has been wide <,> fluctuations <,,> in the percentage growth rate of exports
<,> uh during the months <,> April ninety-four to August ninety <,> uh
August ninety-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#8:1:B>
Sir it was <,> uh sometimes it declined <,> to six percent <,> in
August <,,> uh not in July <,> it declined to six percent <,> and the next
month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#9:1:B>
Sir <-> it </-> <,,> to me <,> this phenomenon seems to be unusual
<,> and that also indicates <,> that there has been <,> some fundamentally
wrong <,> and defective method <,> in <,> in this uh <,> in the effort of the
governemnt to <,> step up the exports <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#10:1:B>
May I know from the honourable minister <,> what are those
fundamentally wrong and defective <,> uh uh defects in the system <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#11:1:B>
Uh if those systems have been <.> id </.> uh this <,> if those
wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified <,> and if identified
growth in the <,,> export in the month of <,> April <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#12:1:B>
April it was twelve percent <,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#13:1:B>
May June July these three months it was single digit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#14:1:B>
And thereafter it has started picking up <,> August September and
October <,> it has been more than twenty-four twenty-five <,,> twenty-seven
percent <,> <{2> <[2> <O> one or two words </O> <,> if you compare <,,> with
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three <&> recording
broken </&>

<$Z> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#15:1:Z>
<[1> Uhn </[1> </{1>

<$Z> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#16:1:Z>
<[2> <O> One or two words </O> </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#17:1:C>
Two twenty-nine percent plans <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#18:1:C>
Therefore sometimes it happens <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#19:1:C>
One of the reason why it happen during this time <,,> mainly
because the <,,> engineering exports <,> where one <,,> incentive scheme was
available to them we replaced it <,,> because the GATT subsidy which they
wish to <,> have to meet the <,> differences between the <,> international
price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of April <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#20:1:C>
So it had some impact and <,> the contribution of engineering <,,>
goods to the overall market is about twelve percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#21:1:C>
Because of <,,> local levy our rice <,,> became <,,> less
competitive

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#22:1:C>
So the agricultural product particularly rice <,> that also <,,> uh
rice export came down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#23:1:C>
Because of shortage of cotton we had to <,,> reduce the exports of
cotton <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#24:1:C>
Therefore there has been some reasons <O> one word </O> analysis we
are making <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#25:1:C>
But <,,> corn case also it happened like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#26:1:C>
Therefore <,,> I <,> do hope <,> that at the end of the year <,>
there could be two <O> one word </O> <,> if I take the average of the first
seven months <,> the exports goods may not be fourteen fifteen percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#27:1:C>
But in this range <,> from the August onwards it continues <,> and
one good point <,> that impact of plague which was thought that it would have
some adverse impact <,> but from the figure of September October it indicates
that <,,> it is not so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#28:1:C>
So if this trend continues then we may end with <,> eighteen
nineteen percent growth

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#29:1:C>
But there is nothing <,> basically fundamentally <,> wrong in the
system

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#30:1:D>
Sir may I know from the honourable minister <,> whether <O>
one or two words </O> whether it is a fact <,,> that the government of late
has decided to slash down the export target for the year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#31:1:D>
May I also further know from the honourable minister <,> uh if not
<,,> what is the target for the current year <,> and uh <,> whether it is
also a fact <,> that uh <,> the <,> uh the tariff was on other forms of
resistances <,> are being increased in our tradition of export market <,>
particularly in the United States of America <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#32:1:D>
If that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and
attain the target for the current year <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#33:1:C>
Sir so far the target is concerned it is <,> for the period of
the full five years that is <,> to co-terminate with the <O> one word </O>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#34:1:C>
From ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of
percentage <,> that thirteen point six percent should be the <,,> enhancement
of export in volume terms in US dollar terms it should be around fifteen to
twenty percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#35:1:C>
And in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year <,> our
exports should be thirty-three point five billion US dollar <,> at the price
level of ninety-one ninety-two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#36:1:C>
In order to achieve that target first year we could not reach <,>
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion
US dollars <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#37:1:C>
Ninety-three ninety-four it is about <,> twenty-two billion US
dollars <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#38:1:C>
Therefore informally I suggested that if we could reach <,> a
target of twenty-five twenty-six billion <,> US dollars <,> in the year
ninety-four ninety-five

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#39:1:C>
Perhaps <,> with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the
target at the <,> terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five
billion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#40:1:C>
That is the target we have

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#41:1:C>
In regard to the question of <,> having some <,> uh restrictions of
export of some of the Indian products to <,> US market <,> one item is <O>
one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#42:1:C>
They have raised some <,> issues which we are contesting <,> but in
the first five months <,> the overall trade <,> of our exports to USA is
encouraging

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#43:1:C>
There has been <,> of the total <,,> share of US market in our
total exports upto April to <,> October is about twenty-two percent <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#44:1:A>
Question number one forty-four <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X45:1:A>
( a) <,> The number of proposals received and cleared during
nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X46:1:A>
( b) The terms and conditions for the foreign investment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#X47:1:A>
( c) Whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of
export earnings <,> and ( d) If so <,> the anticipated export earnings from
foreign investment during the current five year plan </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#48:1:C>
( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three
and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto October <,,> one
thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have
been received and cleared <,> and receiving foreign direct investment of
<indig> rupees </indig> nineteen thousand six hundred and four point <,>
three six <indig> crores </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#49:1:C>
Proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy
nineteen ninety-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#50:1:C>
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir <,> however the date on amount of export
earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#51:1:E>
Mr Speaker sir <,,> I have <}> <-> <.> specica </.> </-> <=>
specifically </=> </}> asked for the terms and conditions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#52:1:E>
The minister has given <,> a short reply <,,> that there are for
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#53:1:E>
Speaker sir <,,> it is good sign <,> that about <,,> twenty
thousand <indig> crores </indig> of foreign investment is coming <,> in one
year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#54:1:E>
But at the <}> <-> <.> si </.> </-> <=> same </=> </}> time <,,> it
appears that there are <,,> bad side effects also <,,> because <,,> this
industry <,,> this investment <,,> there is a tendency <,> to cluster around
<,,> the metropolitan cities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#55:1:E>
And <,> because of that <,,> if we take the example of <,,> Bombay
itself <,,> the prices of local <,> flats <,,> have increased from eight
hundred <,> per square feet to five thousand <indig> rupees </indig> per
square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#56:1:E>
It is for their executives <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#57:1:E>
On the one hand <,> and on the other hand <,> because of lot <{>
<[> of lot of </[> labour employment <,> there will be growth of uh <,>
<indig> zhuggis </indig> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#58:1:A>
<[> What is your question Mr </[> </{> ?

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#59:1:E>
Sir I would like to know from the honourable minister <,>
whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked <,,> to
<,,> set up their industries <,,> in the <,,> newly <,> uh decided <,> growth
centres <,> of countries which are in remote areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#60:1:E>
So what is the incentive being given to them <,> and what <}> <->
is </-> <+> are </+> </}> the <,,> guidelines for that <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#61:1:C>
Mr Speaker sir <,,> in <O> one word </O> industrial policy <,>
statement of July nineteen ninety-one <,> government had explicitly stated
<,> that <,> environmental <,> protection measures will be taken to ensure
that there is no concentration of industries <,> in the metropolitan cities
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#62:1:C>
And that <,> Act is kept in view <,> while sanctioning approval <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#63:1:C>
So I cannot agree with this opposition <,> that Bombay is <,> uh
suffering because too much of <.> invest </.> <,> foreign direct investment
is coming it is certainly true <,> that <w> Bombay's </w> attractiveness as a
financial centre has increased

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#64:1:C>
That certainly has put pressure on land prices <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#65:1:C>
I think there is a <,> way to deal with that

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#66:1:C>
We have existing <,> uh restrictions <,> uh on land transactions
which in my view <,> I think are having bad adverse effects

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#67:1:C>
Well the answer to that is not that we should <,> uh prevent the
growth of Bombay as one of the <w> worlds' </w> leading financial centre <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#68:1:E>
Mr Speaker sir <,,> I had also asked <,,> about the quantum of
<,,> export earnings <,,> that may be <,> obtained <,> after the full
investement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#69:1:E>
But it has been answered <,,> that such data <,> is not being
maintained <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#70:1:E>
My specific query was because <,> there is a general apprehension
<,,> that the foreign investors <,,> are coming to invest in India <,,>
looking <,,> mainly towards the local domestic market <,,> and <w> that's
</w> why <,,> after the domestic market is flooded with <,,> uh the
industrial goods of the <}> <-> <.> for </.> </-> <=> foreign </=> </}>
investors <,> the local industries will also suffer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#71:1:E>
That is the apprehension and <w> that's </w> why <,> what measures
are being taken I would like to know <,> for <,,> uh keeping this foreign
investors <,> in line with others and for asking them <,> to export certain
<,> quota of goods produced <,> in their industry

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#72:1:C>
Sir <,,> eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct
investment <,,> since <,> the introduction of the new policy uptil October
nineteen ninety-four <,> have been in the priority <,> sector <,> which are
<,,> mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of July
<,> ninety-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#73:1:C>
These <,> apparel <,> oil refineries <,> electronics <,> chemical
and food processing <,> telecommunication <,> transportation <,> industrial
<,> machinery

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#74:1:C>
So the <,> assumption that large segment of this <,> investment is
going to consumer goods <,> or nonessential goods <,> is simply not correct
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#75:1:C>
Even where in certain cases <,> we <}> <-> <.> ha </.> </-> <=>
have </=> </}> allowed <,> uh foreign investement in consumer goods <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#76:1:C>
We have ensured <,> that there will be an obligation on the part of
those investors <,> to ensure <,> that their export earnings will match <,>
the dividends outflow for the period of <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#77:1:C>
Also <,> I would <,> uh further like to mention <,> it is not
possible to <,> uh mention <,> or to calculate at this stage what will be <,>
the foreign <.> ex </.> <,> foreign exchange earnings <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#78:1:C>
I preside over the empowered committee <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#79:1:C>
My own feeling is <,> that <-> is </-> very large part of proposals
are <,> directly export oriented and in years to come <,> you will see the
beneficial effects of this on the countries exports

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#80:1:C>
Even in terms <,> of employment uh <,> here of course I am
mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#81:1:C>
This includes the foreign investors and domestic investors <,>
filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil August nineteen <,>
uh uptil <.> Sep </.> October nineteen ninety-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#82:1:C>
They show that the total planned investment is <,,> three <indig>
lakhs </indig> twenty-five thousand five hundred <,> eighty <indig> crores
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#83:1:C>
And when these projects are completed there would be <,> a minimum
addition of over three million jobs <,> to the manufacturing sector

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#84:1:C>
So the assumption that these <,> investments are going to take away
jobs is not correct

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#85:1:C>
In fact they are going to add to the <,> amount of employment in
<w> Indias' </w> manufacturing sector <,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#86:1:F>
Sir I am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#87:1:F>
This is a very important question <,> and according to government
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty <,> uh proposal have
been received and cleared directly <,> from the <,> Central government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#88:1:F>
Sir may I know from the honourable minister <,> minister has
admitted that there are some regional <,> imbalances <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#89:1:F>
Sir specially for the Eastern region sir the Bihar Orissa West
Bengal and other parts of the country <,> where the foreign investment flow
is very poor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#90:1:F>
Will the minister see the matter seriously so that <,> the N R I
can ivest more and more money

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#91:1:A>
This is uh <,> this is replied to <,> <{> <[> sir <,> just two
minutes back

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#92:1:F>
<[> Sir </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#93:1:F>
Sir <,> sir Bihar Orrissa and West Bengal whether the minister
will take up the matter with the <,> State government and the foreign
investors so that they can invest more and more money <,> and specially I
will ask for the Agro-based industry sir <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#94:1:A>
Yes <,> will you persuade the State government <O> one word
</O> <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#95:1:C>
Sir I interact <,> with the honourable chief ministers of many
states <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#96:1:C>
I find today <,> uh there is much greater awareness among the State
governments to create the requisite <,> climate in which investments will
flow <,> and I believe for examples <,> uh take the case of the West Bengal
<,> itself

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#97:1:C>
West Bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which I
think is a forward looking documents

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#98:1:C>
Today I think West Bengal is aggressively seeking foreign
investment

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#99:1:C>
Honourable Somnath Chatterjee is not here

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#100:1:C>
He had been to Australia <,> he had been to Singapore <,> and when
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy <,> he had stated
this is a <O> a few words </O> <&> noise </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#101:1:A>
Mr Finance Minister <,> Mr finance minister <,> your <,> your
praise of his <,> should not create problem for this house <&> noise </&> <O>
a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#102:1:A>
Yes Mr Chavan <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#103:1:G>
<indig> Aap sunlein to pata chal jata hai </indig> <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#104:1:G>
Mr Speaker sir

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#105:1:F>
<indig> Is ka jawab mil gaya </indig>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#106:1:G>
The foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen
fifty proposals <,,> with twenty thousands co-investments <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#107:1:G>
But sir I complaint <,,> that very few projects have started
functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#108:1:G>
The foreign investors are complaining that there is still <,> too
much of red tape <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#109:1:G>
I would like to ask the minister if there is a <,,> machinery
within the government <,> to monitor the progress of these units <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#110:1:C>
Sir <,> the honourable member is right there have been gap in
monitoring <,> but <,> in the last few months <,> we have ensured that the
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry <,> of industry <,> will
monitor <,> these proposals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#111:1:C>
With regards to the actual in flow <,> as against the approval <,>
which <,,> my colleague had mentioned <,> in the last three and a half years
the actual <,> disbursement <,> has exceeded five thousand <indig> crores
</indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#112:1:C>
So it is not entirely correct <,> that these proposals are being
implemented <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-056#113:1:C>
Total amount of disbursement as of now <,> as a proportion of
approval <,> are about twenty-three percent which is not bad <,> considering
that this policy has been in operations <,> only for nearly three years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-056#114:1:A>
Question hour is over <,,> </I>
