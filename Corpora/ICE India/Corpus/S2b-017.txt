Germany should not only join the western military alliance <,> but also be a
base for nuclear weapons <X>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#X27:1:A>
We are looking <,> at this alliance <,> not as an instrument <,,>
of confrontation <,> but as an element <,> of cooperation in a new security
step <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#X28:1:A>

Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences <,> said the surgery had to be performed <,> otherwise the boy

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#97:2:A>
After seven gruelling hours of surgery <,> Jisukh is fine <,> and
he is under observation <,> at the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#98:2:A>
Our correspondent Hemant Kumar has more details <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-017#99:2:B>
This child had a serious heart disease <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#100:2:B>
Two of his major arteries in the heart <,> were cross linked <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#101:2:B>
The human heart has four chambers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#102:2:B>
The right artium <,> the right ventricle <,> and the left artium
and the left ventricle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#103:2:B>
The right artium and the right ventricle receive impure and used
blood <,> from all over the body <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#104:2:B>
A blood vessel <,> called the pulmonary artery carries the impure
blood into the lungs for purification <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#105:2:B>
The pure oxyginated blood then enters the left artium and travels
to the left ventricle <,> the pump house of the heart <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#106:2:B>
From the left ventricle the artery aorta carries the pure blood to
the rest of the body <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#107:2:B>
In the case of this child however the two blood vessels <,>
pulmonary artery and the aorta were wrongly connected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#108:2:B>
The pulmonary artery was connected to the left ventricle <,> and
the aorta to the right ventricle <,> so that all the impure blood was
returning to the body <,> via the pulmonary artery <,> and the purified blood
was flowing back to the lungs <,> through the aorta <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#109:2:B>
The baby was turning blue for lack of oxygen and could have died
had the surgery not been performed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#110:2:B>
What Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the Institute did was in
several stages <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#111:2:B>
First the child was anaesthetize <,> a very difficult task to
perform on an infant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#112:2:B>
Then his rib cage or the thorax <,> was cut open and the
frantically throbbing heart was exposed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#113:2:B>
His heart was then by passed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#114:2:B>
All the impure blood was rooted to an apparatus called the
heartlung machine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#115:2:B>
It purifies the blood and returns it to the body <,> totalling
bypassing the heart

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#116:2:B>
So that it does not beat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#117:2:B>
The heart was then cut open and the arteries exposed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#118:2:B>
Then the arteries were switched <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#119:2:B>
The Aorta was removed from the right ventricle and sewn to the
left ventricle its natural place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#120:2:B>
The pulmonary artery was removed from the left ventricle and
placed at the right ventricle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#121:2:B>
The entire operation took seven hours <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#122:2:B>
And Dr Rao says it was only as risky as any other open heart
surgery <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#123:2:B>
But normally it has very high <,> success rate <,,>

Bharat Pura one of the major rivers flowing from the Western
<indig> Ghats </indig> <,> is facing the grim possibility of fading into
oblivion <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#136:2:A>
The river which was a kilometre broad gush of deep blue water <,>
is now just a sand bed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#137:2:A>
A report from a Trivandrum correspondent <,> John Ulanand <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-017#138:2:C>
Bharat Pura is <w> Kerala's </w> longest river flowing from
the Western <indig> Ghats </indig> into the Arabian sea <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#139:2:C>
Legends surrounding the river go back to the epics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#140:2:C>
It has not only been the key to the prosperity of northern Kerala
<,> but also an integral part of the people <,> and their culture for
centuries <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#141:2:C>
But today <,> the entire course of the river has dried down to
mere sand bed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#142:2:C>
The ground water level has gone down to about ten metres below the
bed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#143:2:C>
Reasons for the <w> river's </w> fate are many <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#144:2:C>
The indiscriminate exploitation of the water resources <,>
deforestation in the catchment areas <,> and collection of the sand from the
bed <,> are a few of them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#145:2:C>
The people of Prithala one of the river side town recently got
together to discuss the need to revive Bharat Pura <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#146:2:C>
The solution they suggested is to save the water that flows into
the Arabian sea <,> during the monsoon month <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#147:2:C>
They requested the government to build a check dam to regulate the
flow of the river <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-017#148:2:C>
A group of environmentalist also have launched a campaign to save
the river <,,>
