<ICE-IND:W2D-001#3:1>
With a broad conspectus, the author first <quote> ` defines the
concept of organisational mission, </quote> discusses its significance,
possible ways of generating creative mission, and the factors contributing to
the success of mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#4:1>
He then takes a critical look at Indian organisational scenario
pointing to the grave dangers of neglecting promotion and practice of genuine
mission - - particularly in governmental and public sector organisations - -
and emphasises the need for permeation of mission in our organisations. </it>
</p> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#5:1>
MOST ORGANISATIONS in this country do not have a mission; in fact,
they are too disorganised to have it; at the same time, it is obvious that
organisation can derive very substantial benefit from developing a mission
around which it should set its operational goals and functional strategy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#6:1>
Even so, it is the general practice that enterprises here do not pay
any attention to this significant subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#7:1>
For most organisations, the word <mention> mission </mention> has
a very restrictive connotation, i.e., a narrow meaning associated with
just definiting the <}> <-> bussiness </-> <+> business </+> </}> that the
organisation is in.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#8:1>
But that hardly reflects the correct position or the whole truth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#9:1>
In a broader sense, the term must include the purpose, strategy,
vision, values and behaviours that make up the <w> organisation's </w> unique
personality. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#10:1>
<h> DEFINING MISSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#11:1>
Mission, in short, must define the following: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#12:1>
<h> ( a) <it> A Purpose </it> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#13:1>
The reason why an organisation exists; its basic rationale, its
focus, its orientation, and its stake. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#14:1>
Examples:

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#15:1>
Certain enterprises set their antena towards shareholders; some
others to customers; some, again, dedicate themselves to employees; still
others to the suppliers, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#16:1>
Choice of a specific purpose <}> <-> involves' <-> </+> involves <+>
</}> resolving competing claims of <w> enterprise's </w> very many
stakeholders.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#17:1>
Because of this, several times there is a confusion and consequent
diffusion of purpose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#18:1>
Successful organisations must rise above the interests of any one
stakeholder, for developing a purpose which is at a higher level and <O> <&>
page </&> 15 </O> can be recognised to be an <quote> ` end' </quote> in
itself, quite independent of - - in fact, transcending - - each such
particularistic objective.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#19:1>
By thus creating a purpose greater than that of any one
stakeholder, an organisation avoids competing claims, tension and conflict
amongst various interest-groups, and achieves the loyalty and support of all.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#20:1>
( b) <h> <it> A Strategy: </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#21:1>
Definition of the business or the activity-charter of the enterprise,
the lines of action-programmes that the organisation wishes to follow.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#22:1>
Strategy must support the purpose and, in that sense, goes to
effectuate the basic objective.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#23:1>
It must, apart from the long-term tactics of goal-realisation,
also cover critical standards and behaviour of the management and employees.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#24:1>
( c) <h> <it> System of Values: </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#25:1>
The beliefs that characterise <w> organisation's </w> management
system, its relationship to employees and other stakeholders and, last but
not the least, its ethics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#26:1>
The value system resonate with strategy and reinforce the purpose,
besides furnishing a necessary, indeed essential, link between purpose and
behavioural styles.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#27:1>
Without values, maintenance may be possible but not sustenance into
long-term future.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#28:1>
Values are barometers, indicating that behaviour, action,
response, etc., are not only good as strategy but also good in themselves in
the sense <mention> that is the right way to behave, that is the right
ethical conduct, unconnected with the transient or exigent contingencies
</mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#29:1>
( d) <h> <it> Standards and behaviours: </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#30:1>
Representing the relevant and befitting normal framework within
which enterprise actions, inter- and intra-relations, behavioural patterns
and norms are framed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#31:1>
They reflect a code which is central to the <w> organisation's </w>
philosophy, ideology and idiom, merging both the strategy and values. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#32:1>
A strong mission exists when the links between behaviour
strategy, values and purposes are not only transparent to all concerned but
reinforcingly established and maintained.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#33:1>
And without a mission, the organisation is without a soul and motive
force.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#34:1>
Mission, then, provides both head and heart to the flesh and blood
and anatomical structure of the organisation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#35:1>
<h> <it> Significance of Mission </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#36:1>
Psychologists and ( organisation) behaviourists have recognised,
beyond doubt, that people at all levels search for meaning in life, including
working life, though the quality and character of meaning may be different to
different strata of people.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#37:1>
If an organisation can give this meaning to the men at work, on top
of and in addition to, pay and other conditions of service, that will inspire
greater involvement, commitment and <}> <-> loyality </-> <+> loyalty </+>
</}> in them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#38:1>
People obviously are better motivated and work with single-minded
dedication and devotion, if they believe in what they are asked to do and are
required to do what they believe in, within the overall framework of <w>
organisation's </w> holistic belief.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#39:1>
This, in turn, signifies that there is a fusion of mission of the
organisation, on the one hand, and <w> individual's </w> , on the other.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#40:1>
This linkage, this marriage between enterprise-values and
individual-values, impinging on mutual behaviour and action, provides the
most enduring and purposeful driving force for productivity, progress and
dynamic future. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 16 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#41:1>
That a sense of mission arising out of harmonisation of meanings,
strategies and values can be self-motivating and equally productive is
self-evident in the case of religious organisations, charities, Boy
Scouts, and even political parties with clearest ideologies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#42:1>
Motivation and commitment may, no doubt, come from, being the
bye-product of strategies, excitement of achievement, honour of being the
best, thrill of award-winning, recognition, and self-actualisation but
they all are sustained through internalisation of an organisational mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#43:1>
Commercial organisations are, however, hard on inculcating that
<quote> ` spirit' </quote> of values and hence, often lack in mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#44:1>
On a limited scale and shorter time-horizon, they succeed through
other short-term strategies and monetary-cum-material methodologies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#45:1>
Strategies, like better decision-making, clearer communication,
greater delegation, humaner management-styles, etc., do equally give good
scores but a mission, hightened by values, can bring additional lasting
benefits. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#46:1>
<h> <it> Advantages of Mission </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#47:1>
Regarding advantages of having a mission in organisation, apart
from ensuring loyalty and commitment of the management and employees, it
also generates greater cooperation and trust, mutual respect, spirit of
working together, besides serving holistic interests.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#48:1>
Consensual decision-making strengthens the will of collaborative
implementation of programmes and makes the task of goal realisation easier.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#49:1>
Sense of mission is a great facilitator of selection and development
of people through a search for likemindedness and constitutes, thus, an
integrating factor.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#50:1>
The point for caution is that this mission must not be woven around
wrong or inappropriate values or misdirected beliefs which then can be
self-destructive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#51:1>
Too much of ossified mission can sometimes lead to a kind of
organisational thrombosis, making change difficult and reforms impossible.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#52:1>
Vitality of thinking and organisation versatility become in such
circumstances an instant casualty by sacrificing flexibility of action and
behavioural response. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#53:1>
<h> GENERATING CREATIVE MISSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#54:1>
How to generate such a creative mission?

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#55:1>
There obviously cannot be one unique way, nor is it amenable to any
easy formulation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#56:1>
Basically, there have to be at least two tasks required to create a
sense of mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#57:1>
The first is the intellectual or conceptual exercise of defining the
purpose, developing strategies and values, reinforcing each other, and
identifying standards and behaviours that are the manifestations of mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#58:1>
The second is the communication and the management task of making the
mission come alive in the organisation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#59:1>
It has to be perceived and appreciated that culture is a function of
cultivation and internalisation, assimilation and systemisation which may
often require long years of fertilisation and efforts at synthesisation; it
is certainly not an exercise in superficial or supercilious adoption of
uncommitted type. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 17 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#60:1>
It is in this sense that a <quote> " culture audit" </quote> is
often a first step to developing values.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#61:1>
And, of course, ultimately <quote> " a corporate identity programme"
</quote> is a must for symbolising the mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#62:1>
The particular method to be chosen must be tailored to the corporate
ambience, outer interactive environment, personalities of the top management
group and other dominant realities as well as dormant traits of the
organisation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#63:1>
<h> <it> Charisma and Mission </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#64:1>
Often times, such missions grow and develop around the charisma
of the founder or a leader of an enterprise, whose personality, vision,
behavioural styles, and pursued corporate policies govern the basic
parameters of the mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#65:1>
A deep sense of integrative instincts emerge amongst all the people
in the organisation if the well-communicated messages emanating from such a
top visionary, can have strategic, i.e., operational as well as fundamental,
value connections. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#66:1>
Quite apart from the charismatic or instinctive build-up, there
is also intellectual approach under which senior management works out a
mission - - a statement which guides the corporate affairs, besides strategic
conduct of business.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#67:1>
This statement is the result of multilevel consultation within the
organisation ( though concensus is well-nigh impossible and hence it is
often a compromise) and, as a document ( written out and published), it is
generally used as a <quote> " centre piece" </quote> of major policy frame,
communication network and referral point of corporate identity programme.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#68:1>
<h> <it> Image Building </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#69:1>
Sometimes, a purely operational approach is also adopted.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#70:1>
Organisations pick up one or two pragmatic, functional themes which,
though related to their basic purpose, have some glamour, <quote> `
sex-appeal' </quote> ( so to speak), and consensual acceptability on a
wider scale.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#71:1>
They represent a kind of capsulised slogans, attractively articulated
and professionally packaged, which click with the customers, give some
directional push to work-force, impart some competitive edge to the
organisation in relation to others.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#72:1>
Enterprises must, however, take precaution about routinisation of
these <quote> ` instant formulae' </quote> and see to it that the external
shine does not wear off too soon!

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#73:1>
Importantly, the people in the organisation are to be made to feel
that crucial management mean them as part of their own and organisational
value sytem, and are honest about them, linking them with deeper mission, and
do not use them as a handy tool or a mere advertising copy for image-building
and an exercise in marketing novelty.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#74:1>
In the latter event, it may degenerate into cynicism and
disillusionment, which may be counter-productive in the long run. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#75:1>
<h> <it> Components of Mission Success </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#76:1>
Some of the conditions for <w> missions' </w> success are: - -
Futuristic vision, - - Value consensus, <O> <&> page </&> 18 </O> - -
Effective communication, - - Leadership continuity, - - Top-team visibility,
- - Programme implementability, - - Dynamic personality, - - Adoptive ( and
adaptive) sincerity, - - Vigorous propagation, and - - Proper timing.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#77:1>
Since action is a better and more potent communicator than words,
the mission must have to be implementation-worthy at all levels; the top
team, the leaders must prove its value and validity by action rather than
empty talk or lecture, and personalised involvement.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#78:1>
The organisational managers must not only believe but be seen to
believe in the reality and utility, productivity and profitability of such
missions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#79:1>
Missions come alive when the leaders try them out themselves and not
when they deliver speeches or send messages.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#80:1>
Lack of consistency in regard to content, too much of strategic
instability at the leadership level, too much variance in management styles
or flexibility of programmes to envision the mission may act to its grave
detriment.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#81:1>
Mission without internal justice and fairplay, integrity and
discipline is bound to fail, whereas value, culture and character give
validity to it and, who does not know, they are the best guarantees of
success, progress and prosperity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#82:1>
Human organisations cannot do without them. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#83:1>
<h> CRITIQUE ON INDIAN ORGANISATIONS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#84:1>
Unfortunately, Indian organisations fail on almost all these
requisite indices and have not particularly been careful in giving
themselves the glory of being <quote> ` mission-motivated' </quote>
enterprises.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#85:1>
In fact, the crucial mission-factor has been missing from the <w>
country's </w> organisational management scenario.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#86:1>
It is a pity that this vital ingredient of sustained growth and that
of prospect of prosperity for any organised endeavour has been neglected.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#87:1>
Organisations do come up - - at least when they are set up - - with
some handy set of objectives as <quote> " objects and reasons" </quote> ,
some <quote> " overalls of goals" </quote> as rationale for creation of the
organisation, some <quote> " agenda of action" </quote> as their basic
functional charter.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#88:1>
But these are not to be confused with the <quote> ` mission' </quote>
which has as much deeper, much more intrinsic significance in relation to <w>
organisation's </w> survival, growth and futuristic progress.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#89:1>
Mission, being different and distinct from maintenance, has to be
related to the soul, the spirit, the totality of ethological character and
operational culture of an organisation, and it does not seem that here is
this country, there is much awareness of developing, far less promoting, such
an ambience which nurtures the existential life of organisations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#90:1>
If our organisations are poor in providing for missionary input,
they are bad in maintenance-output also.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#91:1>
In fact, many perceptive management-analysts and
organisation-watchers have come to the <O> <&> page </&> 19 </O> conclusion -
- not perhaps without reason - - that Indians are incapable of running big
organisations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#92:1>
If one looks at the <quote> ` king-size' </quote> service,
manufacturing, productive or distributive enterprises, one would be aghast at
their monumenttal achievement ( ! ) in the field of goal slippage, norm
displacement and programme miscarriage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#93:1>
Reason for it has to be sought in the singular lack of generating a
sense of mission amongst promotors, operatives and its functionaries. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#94:1>
<h> <it> Lack of Competitiveness </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#95:1>
Part of the explanation for such colosal lapse into slumber of
inefficiency, ineffectiveness and managerial intrasigence of several of
our large-sized organisations lies in the lack of competitiveness arising out
of their monopolisation ( state-induced or otherwise) of the market, where
the clientele, i.e., the people are at the mercy of manoeuvring mercenaries
and unmotivated managers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#96:1>
These monopolisers are not idealiser - - they are not even
optimisers - - with respect to input-output correlation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#97:1>
They are wanting in ideology, ideal, a philosophy, a directive
purpose; they lack dream, inner drive, vision and, above all, a mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#98:1>
How will they enthuse others when they themselves have no enthusiasms
to transmit?

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#99:1>
And the enthusiasms is a function of an internal urge, a spirit,
faith, and commitment to a cause.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#100:1>
Our organisation-men have lost these on the way - - perhaps they
never had them at the start itself.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#101:1>
That is why a lamentable mismatch is in evidence all over the
organisational life, and its character and culture being the obvious
casualty. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#102:1>
<h> <it> Mere Gimmickry </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#103:1>
But there is no dearth of gimmickry.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#104:1>
Attempts at manipulating the market through superficial
sloganisation unconnected, in actuality, with the <w> organisations' </w>
operative styles and performance, far removed in any case from any basic
purpose, are much in vogue.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#105:1>
For a Department to flash <indig> <it> Aharnisha Sevamahe </it>
</indig> in the logo when, in practice, in its behaviour and day-to-day
operation <indig> <it> seva </it> </indig> is the missing dimension ( at
least, that is the popular perception on the basis of experience) is, on the
face of it, self-contradictory, and wholly unconvincing as to its profession
of mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#106:1>
People suspect not only lack of seriousness on the part of the
organisation to translate into reality what it projects as its charter but
may further go to the extent of doubting the bonafides of intention and
honesty of purpose.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#107:1>
In such a situation, organisational credibility dips into the
lowest, reinforced by a clientele perception of breach of faith on account of
constant dereliction of duty.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#108:1>
Similarly, to announce <quote> " For you, with you, always" </quote>
by an organisation which has not distinguished itself by being with you -- with
anybody for that matter-ever, would appear a hypocritical publicity stunt
and it often turns out to be counter-productive, destructive ( and not
promotive) of the organisational image. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#109:1>
<h> <it> Dangers </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#110:1>
The lesson then is that unless the organisation <foreign> <it>
ab initio </it> </foreign> internalises a <O> <&> page </&> 20 </O> mission
reflective in its policy, programmes, styles, behaviour, relations,
actions and interactions as well as other indicators turn out to be mere
media copy, catchy in words but empty in substance, and cannot go far to
retrieve the situation of a developing gap between promise and performance
and precept and practice.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#111:1>
An organisation must prove by its action what it says or purports to
be doing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#112:1>
Organisation without mission, as is the prevalent situation in
this country, generates antipathy, withdrawal syndrome and, at worst,
antagonistic antibiosis!

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#113:1>
An organisation proclaiming <quote> " We enjoy people" </quote> must
not indulge in commerical exploitation of the people who come to it but must
redeem its pledge by service.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#114:1>
Otherwise, they may writen on papers whatever they feel like but
people, <it> i.e., </it> the customers do not enjoy it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#115:1>
The slogan is not worth the paper it is written on. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#116:1>
<h> SUMMING UP </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-001#117:1>
Indian organisations either do not seem to believe in missions
or, if they do, do not mean practising it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#118:1>
They neglect the mission which, in virtual retaliation, almost
eludes them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#119:1>
Along with it, the missing dimension on organisational life is
the total lack of consciousness about the seminal significance of
generating a constructive and honest corporate culture which should not only
internalise but also enlarge, in practice, the mission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#120:1>
The result is pathetic, if not tragic.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#121:1>
To avoid the continuing tragedy of absence of mission, what is
needed is a cultural commitment, concomitant corporate culture and an
abiding faith in ideology, a vision of a man with missionary zeal, a leader
who is not afraid of dreaming, a combination of being a realist as well as an
idealist.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#122:1>
That, no doubt, is a tall order but is an inescapable ingredient
of organisational sustenance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-001#123:1>
Mission is, indeed, the life breath of <w> organisation's </w>
existence, permeating in its ambience, and ensuring a place in the sun for
it. </p> </I>
