<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-009#1:1:A>
All right now <w> we've </w> been looking at <w> Catford's </w> theory
of <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#2:1:A>
That doesn't mean uh you should not write <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#3:1:A>
Okay just because <w> it's </w> being recorded doesn't mean that you
shouldn't take down notes <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#4:1:A>
Of course you will have to <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#5:1:A>
Uh <,> let us first look at the way he <,> uh <}> <-> we have seen at
uh </-> <=> we have looked at his </=> </}> theory of language <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#6:1:A>
This is basically a model of language <,> description which is
borrowed from <,> Halliday <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#7:1:A>
Uh which is known as a scale in category model of <,> uh English <,,>
grammar <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#8:1:A>
Now <w> let's </w> turn to his discussion of and classification of
translation type


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#9:1:A>
Now <w> Catford's </w> theory of translation is essentially <,> a
product oriented theory <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#10:1:A>
Why do we call it a product oriented theory ?


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#11:1:A>
Because <,,> his main attempt is <,,> to look at <,,> different kinds
of translation <,> and classify <,,> these translations into different
categories <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#12:1:A>
<w> He's </w> not looking into the mind of a translator <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#13:1:A>
He is looking at the object <,> of translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#14:1:A>
The object that the translator has produced <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#15:1:A>
Which means that he is looking at the empirical <,,> product of
translation <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#16:1:A>
What has been actually produced <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#17:1:A>
And he is not looking at <,> what was going <,,> behind the
translation <,> in the mind of the <,> translator <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#18:1:A>
So this theory is often called a product orientated theory of
translation because the approach here is empirical <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#19:1:A>
It tries to analyse <,> classify categorise <,> translations <,>
products of translations into different types <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#20:1:A>
Now for <,,> Catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned
<,> with a certain type of relation between languages <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#21:1:A>
And therefore he calls it a branch of Comparative Linguistics <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#22:1:A>
Now in this <,> <}> <-> he is very much </-> <=> his approach is very
much </=> </}> like the approach of Halliday <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#23:1:A>
Halliday also if you remember <,,> argues that translation is not an
independent <,> branch of <}> <-> <.> dis </.> or </-> <=> discipline </=>
</}> <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#24:1:A>
Uh it is a branch of Comparative Linguistics <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#25:1:A>
Where you compared languages <,,> so to establish the comparability
between languages <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#26:1:A>
How far they are structurally similar or dissimilar <,,> you use
translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#27:1:A>
Catford however goes on to define the translation process <,,>
further <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#28:1:A>
He says translation is always unidirectional <,,> that is <,> you can
always <,> translate at one time <,> from one language to another and not
vice versa <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#29:1:A>
That is translation has a direction <,,> from English into Marathi or
Marathi into English <,> unidirection <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#30:1:A>
One direction <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#31:1:A>
At one time you can't translate from both English into Marathi as
well as Marathi into English <,> it will have to be a unidirectional process
from one language to another <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#32:1:A>
That language <,,> from which you translate <,> is called a source
language <,,> and the language into which you translate is called a target
language <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#33:1:A>
And translation is defined <,,> as <,> <quote> the replacement of
</quote> <,,> write down the definition please <,> <quote> the replacement of
textual material in one language <,> that is S L <,,> by eqivalent textual
material in another language </quote> <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#34:1:A>
Now obviously <,,> there are two key terms in this definition <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#35:1:A>
One is <,,> <quote> textual material </quote> <,> and another is <,>
<quote> eqivalent <,> textual material </quote>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#36:1:A>
The term <quote> eqivalent </quote> <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#37:1:A>
So essentially he is talking about a particular type of text <,,> and
a particular type of eqivalence <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#38:1:A>
These are the key operations key terms in translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#39:1:A>
So before we go on to to discuss the term <-> of <,> the term </->
<quote> eqivalent </quote> <,> let us look at the types of translation <,,>
uh <,> that he argues there exist <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#40:1:A>
These categories of translations or types of translations <,,> are
<,,> proposed in terms of <,> extent of translation <,> level of translation
and rank of translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#41:1:A>
Level of translation <,,> extent of translation <,> and rank of
translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#42:1:A>
Let us first look at the classification <,,> according to <,> the
extent of translation <,,> that he proposes <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#43:1:A>
<-> There are </-> in each of these there are two types of
translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he
proposes <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#44:1:A>
So <,> according to the extent to which you translate a text <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#45:1:A>
How much <,> of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense
<,> in the linear sense


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#46:1:A>
Syntagmatic means linear <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#47:1:A>
So are you taking the full text <,> for translation or are you taking
only half of the text for translation <,,> ?


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#48:1:A>
How much <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> the text are you taking up
for translation <,,> based upon <}> <-> this </-> <=> this </=> </}> is known
as the extent <,,> of translation <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#49:1:A>
Now <,> he says if you take the entire text <,> for translation it is
known as full translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#50:1:A>
If you take only half of the text <,> it will be partial translation
<,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#51:1:A>
So full versus partial translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#52:1:A>
Now this text may be anything <,> alright


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#53:1:A>
It may be a single poem <,> it may be a book of <,> <-> short stories
</-> collection of short stories


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#54:1:A>
It may be essays <,> a novel whatever <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#55:1:A>
It can be only a sentence also <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#56:1:A>
Text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit <,,> which
can be <,> once again of course sub-divided into different units


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#57:1:A>
If you <,> take the totality of the text in translation <,,> uh you
translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part
of it it is known as <,> partial translation


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#58:1:A>
And this relates to the term extent of translation


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#59:1:A>
So he proposes three terms extent <,> level and rank <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#60:1:A>
And the first classification according to the extent is full versus
partial translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#61:1:A>
Now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the
text are left untranslated <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#62:1:A>
This may happen for various reasons <,,> for example if you are
translating the description of a marriage ceremony <,> uh from Marathi into
English <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#63:1:A>
If there is a sentence <,> <quote> <indig> sanaiche mangal sur <->
hote </-> <,> ghumat hote </indig> </quote> <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#64:1:A>
How will you translate the term <quote> <indig> sanai </indig>
</quote> <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#65:1:A>
You can't <,> because there is no equivalent for <quote> <indig>
sanai </indig> </quote>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#66:1:A>
Now in that case probably <w> we'll </w> have to keep some of these
terms <,> just like that in the translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#67:1:A>
You will have to say uh <,,> I don't know how you would translate
this into English but you will have to keep the word <quote> <indig> sanai
</indig> </quote> if you might probably say <quote> <indig> shahnai </indig>
</quote> <,,> okay


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#68:1:A>
To make it sound different from the Marahti item


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#69:1:A>
But you are not proposing any English eqivalent term for <indig>
shahanai </indig> or <indig> sanai </indig> <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#70:1:A>
So <,> there may be different reasons why you increase parts


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#71:1:A>
Sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent
concepts also <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#72:1:A>
In that <}> <-> case </-> <=> case </=> </}> you will have to keep
the term as it is <,,> uh in the <,> uh translated text


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#73:1:A>
So there are different reasons for why you <,,> uh have to <,> adopt
the processes of <,> partial translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#74:1:A>
Now <,> the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the
level of language in question <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#75:1:A>
This classification <,> according to the level of translation <,> uh
<,> is proposed <,> as total translation versus restricted translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#76:1:A>
Now total translation means <,> translation made at all levels of the
source language <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#77:1:A>
When we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing <,> he
discussed <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#78:1:A>
He said that he <,,> talks about different levels of organization of
language for example there is a phonological level <,> there is a
morphological level <,> there is a syntactic level <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#79:1:A>
These are all different levels of language


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#80:1:A>
Now <,> what level are you translating <,,> for example he gives
later on an example of <,> if you write <quote> Indian Airline </quote> <,>
the word <mention> Indian word </mention> Indian Airline you can write that
in English <,> I N D I A N A I R L I N E S <,> or you can also write write it
in <,> <mention> E </mention> <,> and then <,> a <indig> nukta </indig> on
top <,> <mention> D </mention> <,> with <indig> kana matra ya </indig> and
<indig> na </indig> <,> this is also possible


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#81:1:A>
You can use uh Devanagari script in other words


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#82:1:A>
So <,> in <,> restricted translation in total translation you are
taking <,> you are proposing translation equivalence <,,> at all levels of
<,> the text <,,> morphological syntactic etcetera


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#83:1:A>
And graphalogical also <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#84:1:A>
Now the problem is only <,> uh you don't have equivalence between
graphalogical level <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#85:1:A>
You can't have equivalence between graphological level because these
are two <,> substances <,> so there won't be any equivalence between these
two


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#86:1:A>
But you can say that there is equivalence in <,> sentence structure
<,> noun phrases <,> uh <,> word <,> okay or <,> uh clauses <,> main
clause-main clause <,> relative clause-relative clause <,> this can happen


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#87:1:A>
So in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in
restricted translation <}> <-> you have </-> <=> you have </=> </}>
replacement <,,> uh <-> of </-> only of few levels okay


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#88:1:A>
Uh <,,> once again the third is <,,> uh <,,> the rank of translation
<,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#89:1:A>
Now we use in traditional terminology we use <,> <quote> free
</quote> translation <,,> uh as a term <quote> literal </quote> translation
or <quote> free </quote> translation <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#90:1:A>
Now Catford classification of translation type here <,> <quote>
unbounded </quote> and <quote> bounded </quote> translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#91:1:A>
<mention> Bounded </mention> is rank bound translation and unbounded
is <,> translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the
scale <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#92:1:A>
Now let us look at what this means exactly <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#93:1:A>
If <-> is </-> there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb
phrase <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#94:1:A>
You translate noun phrases as noun phrases


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#95:1:A>
So article by article adjective by adjective <,,> a noun by noun <,,>
phrase by phrase clause by clause


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#96:1:A>
<}> <-> This is that is the rank of </-> <=> there are different
ranks </=> </}> we know <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#97:1:A>
The rank of clause sentence phrase <,> word <,,> and sound <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#98:1:A>
Your translation may be tied to these ranks <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#99:1:A>
As I said <,> article by article <,> noun by noun adjective by
adjective adverb by adverb <,> this is verb by verb


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#100:1:A>
This is possible when you translate like this <,> it is known as
rank bound translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#101:1:A>
Sentence by sentence translation <,> that is also rank bound
translation


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#102:1:A>
Within that sentence you may have <,> rank shifting <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#103:1:A>
When we were discussing <,,> the scale of rank <,,> rank shifting
<,> we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a
sentence a clause for example functions as part of N P we say that a <,>
clause is actually in the higher category <,> and the word or the phrase is
actually in the lower category <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#104:1:A>
But a clause can function as a part of the phrase <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#105:1:A>
Right <,> ?


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#106:1:A>
When we say <quote> the boy who was standing in the corner </quote>
<,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#107:1:A>
Now <mention> who was standing in the corner </mention> is a clause
which is part of a phrase <,> noun phrase <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#108:1:A>
Here we see rank shifting taking place <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#109:1:A>
Where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded
translation <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#110:1:A>
It is not rank bound <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#111:1:A>
Sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that <,,> this
translation is literal translation and this translation is <,> uhm <,> free
translation


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#112:1:A>
These are the terms which we usaully proposed


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#113:1:A>
You might be asked a question on this <,,> uh <quote> the difference
between traditional terminology of describing translation products and <,>
terminology used by Catford </quote> <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#114:1:A>
Now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal <,,>
in both senses <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#115:1:A>
Right <-> in </-> when we talk about <quote> literal translation
</quote> <,> we may mean <,,> uh <quote> word by word translation </quote>
<,,> literal translation


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#116:1:A>
Word by word <,> or we may also mean sentence by sentence
translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#117:1:A>
The traditional classification is rather vague <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#118:1:A>
Sentence by sentence also becomes literal <,> word by word also
becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#119:1:A>
If you translated a phrase such as <indig> Kakhet kalasa </indig>
and <indig> gavala valasa </indig> <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#120:1:A>
If you translate this literally word by word <,,> it will give some
very funny meaning I suppose in English <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#121:1:A>
That will be literal translation <,> where you are totally ignoring
the meaning <,> uh <,> you are translating each word <,> but that meaning is
not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#122:1:A>
There can be <,> also example I gave you some examples from the
Bible <,,> <indig> Je majakadun tijmadhye janmvile te </indig> <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#123:1:A>
A case of <,> rank bound translation <,> case of rank bound
translation <,> case of literal translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#124:1:A>
But remember rank bound is much more clear and definite <,> clearly
defined <,> because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or
phrase or word or sound <,> for phoneme <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#125:1:A>
Whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague <,> because
in literal translation it can be anything <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#126:1:A>
It can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word <,>
meaning by meaning <,> okay <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#127:1:A>
But <,> literal translation will always be rather awkward <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#128:1:A>
Unless the two languages are absolutely identical which <,> would
very rarely be the case <,,> it would be a very awkward translation <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#129:1:A>
Whereas <,,> unbounded translation <,,> see we are establishing <,>
clarity between the terms that Catford proposes and the terms that have been
proposed in traditional translation criticism <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#130:1:A>
Catford proposes terms like <,,> <quote> unbounded and bounded
</quote> <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#131:1:A>
<mention> Bounded </mention> is according to the <,> traditional
terminology <,> <mention> literal </mention> translation <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#132:1:A>
And we saw the difference between these two terms <,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#133:1:A>
In <,,> uh <,> <mention> unbounded </mention> translation <,,> you
can take liberties with the text <,,> that means that sometimes a whole
sentence may be translated in a word


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#134:1:A>
It is possible to do that <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#135:1:A>
Or one for one word you may use <,> one sentence <,,>


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#136:1:A>
Sometimes in unbounded translation <,> Catford doesn't discuss this
possibility but it is possible to even delete <,,> or add <,,> portions of
the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the
text


<ICE-IND:S1B-009#137:1:A>
This is possible <,> </I>
