<ICE-IND:S2A-023#1:1:A>
Chalk <,> with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my  
disposal <,> because that is what we are all use to <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#2:1:A>
But uh <,> this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that I  
will not be able to move from the <,,> uh dais uh here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#3:1:A>
Now <,> I have chosen for my talk today <,> a subject <,> <w>  
India's </w> science and technology policy <,,> and the possible role of  
universities in its implementation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#4:1:A>
While choosing this topic I had two view points <,> in mind <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#5:1:A>
First <,> that as <,,> citizens rather than as teachers you should  
know <,> in what direction <,> our government is moving <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#6:1:A>
What should be <,,> the basis of our technological <,> programmes  
<,,> and <,,> how should we really go about it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#7:1:A>
Secondly <,> I thought that as teachers of the university <,> you  
should <,,> know what we should be doing in order to assist <,> our national  
programmes 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#8:1:A>
And therefore <,,> partly informative <,> partly I could say <,> a  
request of what you should really be doing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#9:1:A>
Now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right  
from the beginning <,,> say from the invention of the wheel <,> you have  
found that the scientific discovery <,> has been followed by some sort of a  
major sociological development <,> or economic development <,> where the life  
patterns have changed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#10:1:A>
You <,> as I said you could start with the invention of the wheel  
<,> you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine  
brought the revolution <,> or you could come to the present day where the  
computer <,> uh chip is bringing about such a revolution <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#11:1:A>
And therefore <,> it is very essential to plan our <,> scientific  
programmes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#12:1:A>
So you can say that the industrial revolution <,> which swept  
Europe <,> say in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries <,> highlighted the  
fact that the economic growth <,> of a nation <,> is largely depend upon the  
scientific and technological advances <,,> it can achieve <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#13:1:A>
And therefore <,> we must have a consistance science and technology  
policy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#14:1:A>
Now you may have a policy <,,> it may be perfectly laid down <,>  
every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy <,> only  
<,> if the proper environment is present <,> and if you have got a trained  
personnels to implement that policy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#15:1:A>
This applies not only to science and technology it <,> applies to  
every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#16:1:A>
We may <,> know that our M Sc syllabii for example must contain A B  
C D <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#17:1:A>
We also <,> know that all these things must be taught 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#18:1:A>
But unless <,> the whole atmosphere in the university is such that  
we can really teach those aspects <,,> and we got trained personnels who are  
capable of teaching we find that <,> this sort of thing doesn't work <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#19:1:A>
And therefore the first point we must always remember <,> while  
considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is  
<,> that the proper background has got to be developed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#20:1:A>
Thus <,,> you will find that when we finally come to the  
implementation <,> of the national policies <,> the brunt will have to come  
<,> on the university and on the teaching system 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#21:1:A>
Because we are going to provide them <,> the men who are going to  
later <,> uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our  
scientific and technological development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#22:1:A>
Now this aspect <,> was <,,> well thought out by our national  
leaders even before we became independent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#23:1:A>
The <,> science and technology policy <.> gre </.> owes a great  
deal <,> to the foresight of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#24:1:A>
Even before <,,> we achieved independence in the days <,> of  
pre-independence <,> uh you will find that in one of the <.> In </.> uh <,>  
uh Indian National Congresses he had outlined our policies <,> in nineteen  
hundred forty-six when his <mention> Discovery of India </mention> came out  
<,> there were statements <,> which clearly showed <,> that he realized <,>  
that the social <,,> upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic  
scientific policy was designed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#25:1:A>
And <w> I'll </w> just quote one sentence <,> from his <mention>  
Discovery of India </mention> which will <,> let you know what his thinking  
was <,> this in quotes is <,> open quote <quote> It is science alone that can  
<,,> solve the problems of hunger and poverty <,> of insanitation and  
illiteracy <,> of superstition and deadening customs and traditions <,> of  
vast resources running to waste <,> of a rich country inhabitate by starving  
<,> people </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#26:1:A>
And therefore <,,> looking at all the problems he tried to set  
right the scientific background <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#27:1:A>
And while <,> setting right the scientific background he did not  
<,> think in terms <,> of the natural uh resources alone <,> in terms of say  
<,> laboratory development but he emphasised <,> the need of what is known as  
the scientific temper <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#28:1:A>
So the very basis of the science and technology policy as  
visualized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru <,> was the development of a scientific  
temper <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#29:1:A>
Even <,> in any field this could be <,> uh applied and it basically  
means that you should be able to think in a logical manner <,> you should be  
able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is  
going to lead to <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#30:1:A>
Whether your uh <,> actions are correct or incorrect <,> whether  
they can be <,> supported <,> or not supported that is what the scientific  
attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means <,>  
and that is what he emphasised 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#31:1:A>
So the basic <,> understanding is <,,> that <,> you should first  
learn <,> to think logically <,,> and to act logically <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#32:1:A>
Now with this <,> background <,> he <,,> set about <,> uh <,,> to  
creating <,,> a background on which technologicl development took place <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#33:1:A>
Firstly we all know that <,> he <,> said that we have got to  
provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more  
rapidly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#34:1:A>
The <,> spinning wheel or the <indig> charkha </indig> <,> had its  
own symbolic value 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#35:1:A>
It had its value as far as the villages were <}> <-> <.> con </.>  
</-> <=> concerned </=> </}> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#36:1:A>
But <,,> simply by producing <,> say <indig> khadi </indig> we  
would not survive in the world of competition 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#37:1:A>
And therefore for a even <,> such a small thing <,> as <,> a  
<indig> charkha </indig> he introduced <,> the mechanized type of <indig>  
charkha </indig> which is known as the <indig> amber charkha </indig> or it  
was known as the <indig> amber charkha </indig> in those days <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#38:1:A>
Similarly he said about building <,> dams <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#39:1:A>
Uh <,,> he said about <}> <-> <.> bui </.> </-> <=> building </=>  
</}> up heavy industries 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#40:1:A>
In fact <,> the knowledge that the storage of water was essential  
for our agricultural development <,> led to our policy of big dams 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#41:1:A>
It was at that time in the early uh the late uh <,,> say <,> uh  
late forties and early fifties that we thought of Hirakud and uh <,> Bhakra  
and so on <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#42:1:A>
And in those days he emphasised that dams <-> our </-> <,> are the  
temples of modern India 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#43:1:A>
He did not want people to go <,> uh to uh a temple in the religious  
way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects <,>  
which <,,> could be emulated <,> which <,> could serve <,> as <,> a symbol of  
progress should be our real temples <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#44:1:A>
At the same time he <,,> set about <,> setting up large research  
laboratories 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#45:1:A>
The first was of course <,> the National Chemical Laboratory at  
Poona then you have the National Physical Laboratory and a chain of National  
Laboratories came <,> uh forward <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#46:1:A>
Today <,,> there are people <,> and there is who think that these  
steps were probably not in our best interest 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#47:1:A>
For example <,,> uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water  
it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological  
aspects or of the environmental aspects <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#48:1:A>
You can say <,> that a national laboratory <,> created certain  
small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory  
<,> deprived you can say the university 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#49:1:A>
These are things <,> <-> we </-> which we find in hind-side 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#50:1:A>
But it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific  
base <,> which was <w> Nehru's </w> <,> real contribution to <,> our  
development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#51:1:A>
And in terms of this uh <,> contribution <,,> the first thing that  
India did <,,> was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what  
was known <,> as a scientific policy resolution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#52:1:A>
Do you mind if I <,,> treated it like a class-room sir <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#53:1:A>
Because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#54:1:A>
It was at this point <,> that <,,> we adopted in nineteen hundred  
and fifty-eight <,> what is known as the scientific <,,> policy <,,>  
resolution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#55:1:A>
Now this scientific policy <,> <}> <-> <.> res </.> </-> <=>  
resolution </=> </}> <,,> was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific  
programmes in future <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#56:1:A>
Now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#57:1:A>
The first major point was <,,> to foster <,> promote <,> and  
sustain the cultivation of science <,> and scientific research in all aspects  
<,> pure applied and educational <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#58:1:A>
So <,,> the promotion <,> of research was the main <,> framework or  
the main bullwork on which our science policy was based <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#59:1:A>
The second point was <,> to ensure an adequate supply <,> of  
research scientist of high quality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#60:1:A>
It was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific  
equipment but the scientific personnel <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#61:1:A>
The third <,> uh point was <,> to encourage and initiate <,> with  
all possible speed <,> programmes for the training of scientific and  
technical persons <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#62:1:A>
The next was <,,> to ensure that creative talent <,> is encouraged  
<,> and finds full scope in scientific activity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#63:1:A>
And <,,> encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and  
desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#64:1:A>
And lastly <,> to secure for the people of the country <,> all the  
benefits that can accrue <,> from the acquisition <,> and application of  
scientific knowledge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#65:1:A>
So these are the points which I will give you <,> later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#66:1:A>
But here we have got to emphasis the fact that <,> what was  
required was one <,> <}> <-> <.> bui </.> </-> <=> building </=> </}> up the  
scientific <}> <-> <.> infra </.> </-> <=> infrastructure </=> </}> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#67:1:A>
Second <,> building up this uh scientific <,> personnel required  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#68:1:A>
Third <,> was to ensure <,> that <,> scientific knowledge was  
dessiminated to the people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#69:1:A>
And above all what is most important <,> was to see <,> that any  
scientific <,> uh programme or any scientific discovery <,> did not lie in  
science alone <,> but it was transmitted to the <,> people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#70:1:A>
Now in much later you will find that uh <,> in the late eighties  
this came out in the form of our technological mission which I will talk to  
about later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#71:1:A>
But the building up of the infrastructure <,> the building up of  
the personnel require <,> the transformation of information <,> and <,> the  
transformation of the benefits of science <,,> to <,> uh the rural <.> popu  
</.> uhn people or to the poorer section that was the main <,> thrust or the  
main <,> basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and  
fifty-eight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#72:1:A>
Uh <,> the <O> one word </O> basic difficulty about this <,,>  
scientific policy resolution which the <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> adopted was  
<,> it spoke of science <,> but it did not <}> <-> spoke </-> <=> speak </=>  
</}> of technology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#73:1:A>
So the next step came <,> in <,,> nineteen hundred and  
seventy-three <,> when a national committee for science and technology <,>  
was formed to advise on how <,> the scientific achievements or the scientific  
material could be transferred into technology 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#74:1:A>
And that is when <,> the people came in <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#75:1:A>
Now this <,,> uh committee <,> on science and technology <,,>  
presented an approach paper <,> in nineteen hundred seventy <,> three <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#76:1:A>
So this is the science and technology <,> committee <,> report <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#77:1:A>
And this science and technology committee report <,> emphasised  
again four or five points <,> which are <,,> firstly <,,> the resources  
allotted to research and development in India <,> and other developing  
countries were grossly inadequate 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#78:1:A>
That was the first point <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#79:1:A>
The second <,> the transfer or import of technology <,> from  
developed countries <,> was not in the interest of developing countries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#80:1:A>
Thirdly <,> many required technologies could be indigenously <,,>  
developed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#81:1:A>
Fourthly <,> quality and relevance of education in schools and  
universities <,> had to be ensured <,> so as to stop <,> the stupendest waste  
in human resources <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#82:1:A>
And <,> next <,> an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor  
<,> evaluate <,> correct <,> and redirect various programmes in science and  
<,> technology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#83:1:A>
Now <,> if you look at <,> the basic points of the report of the  
nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee <,> you  
will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and  
ninety-one that is the eighteen years later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#84:1:A>
We are not saying anything <,> quite new <,> we are again stating  
the same fact that we don't have enough money for research <,> that we should  
not import technology from outside <,> we should develop our own technology  
<,> the quality of our education should improve <,> and <,> that an adequate  
machinery should be <,> formed to transfer the benefits of science to society  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#85:1:A>
So in other words <,> though our thinking process have been proper  
<,,> though we have realized what should be done <,,> though we know the path  
on which we have to travel <,> we are not being able to implement it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#86:1:A>
And this <,> if you can recall brings <,,> uh that out my opening  
remarks <,> that what is necessary is not only a science and technology  
policy <,> but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to  
promote the policy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#87:1:A>
If after twenty years <,> we still can not find an answer <,,> to  
<,,> uh the questions <,> which we set ourselves <,> uh a long time back then  
there is something wrong <,> and that wrong is that we have not developed the  
right <,> attitude in which our scientific development <,> can <,> take place  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#88:1:A>
Then <,,> the next step <,> is in nineteen hundred and eighty <,>  
three <,,> when <,> the government gave what is known <,> as the technology  
policy statement <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#89:1:A>
Now this technology policy <,> statement <,,> tried to <,,> say  
what should be our programmes of technological development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#90:1:A>
And this is essentially something <,> which is more or less a  
repeat <,> of what has been visualized in the science and <,> technology <,>  
policy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#91:1:A>
So the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology  
policy statement <,> according to which the basic objectives of a <w>  
nation's </w> technology policy were stated to be <,> firstly <,> development  
of indigenous technology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-023#92:1:A>
Second <,> acquisition of imported technology and its efficient  
absorption <,> and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources  
<,,> </I>
