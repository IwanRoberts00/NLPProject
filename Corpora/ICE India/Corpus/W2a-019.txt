<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> Life Insurance
Corporation of <w> India's </w> Group Superannuation Scheme is an instrument
for providing annuity to the employees or their dependants at the time of
superannuation, retirement or death, as the case may be.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#4:1>
The annuity is paid from the moneys contributed by the employer to the
fund during the service span of an employee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#5:1>
Most of the well reputed companies in India have their own approved
superannuation fund, and the sums contributed to the fund, on behalf of
employees, together with accumulated interest, are utilised for purchasing an
annuity from <mention> LIC </mention> , at the time of retirement or death of
each employee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#6:1>
The main object of creating a superannuation fund is to provide for a
regular income in the form of annuity to the employees after their retirement
from the service. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#7:1>
Various annuity plans of <mention> LIC </mention> have come up for
criticism as the annuity paid to the employees at the time of superannuation,
retirement, as the case may be, is so meagre and inadequate that such amount
paid work out to a bare 11 per cent interest on the total corpus accumulated
from the sums contributed by the employer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#8:1>
The <mention> LIC </mention> , by taking advantage of mandatory
provisions of rules 89 and 91 of the Income-tax Rules, which allows
commutation of annuity to the extent of one third, where an employee receives
gratuity, and one half in other cases, appropriates, the balance amount,
i.e., 66.66 per cent or 50 per cent, as the case may be.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#9:1>
Moreover, the annuity paid to the employees also ceases after a
specified guaranteed period.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#10:1>
If the employers are allowed to create their own funds and invest
similar amount in safe securities like <mention> NSS, </mention> <mention>
NSC, </mention> bank deposits, <mention> UTI </mention> , etc., the principal
amount is not only secured but the return on investment in such securities
would be far higher than what is offered under the annuity plans of <mention>
LIC </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#11:1>
The LIC has recently introduced a new annuity plan to overcome
many of the shortcomings of its earlier annuity plans.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#12:1>
The new annuity plan provides for return of capital to the nominee /
beneficiary of the employee at the time of death.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#13:1>
This provision was not there in its earlier schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#14:1>
An attempt has been made in this article to compare the benefits
offered under the new annuity plan which guarantees payment of annuity for a
specified period and life thereafter with other annuity plans.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#15:1>
A comparison has also been made on the rate of return on sums
invested in the new annuity plan and <quote> <mention> ` Jeevan Dhara'
</mention> </quote> , as it is felt that such comparison would be more
meaningful as both are deferred annuity schemes administered by <mention> LIC
</mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#16:1>
Moreover, the contribution under <quote> <mention> ` Jeevan Dhara'
</mention> </quote> would qualify for deduction upto Rs. 40,000 from the
gross income of an employee under section 80 CCA of the Income-tax Act. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#17:1>
<h> SUPERANNUATION FUND </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#18:1>
The objective of the superannuation fund is to provide for
annuity to the employees and their dependants on superannuation, death or
retirement as the case may be.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#19:1>
The sums contributed by the employers to the fund, during the service
tenure of the employee, gets accumulated together with interest and is
utilised by LIC for purchasing an annuity policy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#20:1>
Any other investments, other than Group Superannuation Scheme of
<mention> LIC </mention> , would not receive the approval of the Commissioner
of Income tax, and will also not qualify for deduction on business
expenditure under section 36 of the Income-tax Act. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#21:1>
The mandatory provisions of rule 89 of the Income-tax Rules make
it obligatory for an employer to constitute a trust for payment of annuity
by:

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#22:1>
( <roman> 1 </roman> ) entering into a scheme with <mention> LIC
</mention> established under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 ( 32 of ]
956 ) ; or

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#23:1>
( <roman> 2 </roman> ) accumulate the contribution in respect of each
beneficiary / nominee and purchase an annuity from <mention> LIC </mention>
at the time of retirement or death of each employee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#24:1>
Rule 90 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, allows for commutation of
annuity, provided such commutation of annuity does not exceed: ( a) in case
where an employee receives any gratuity, the commuted value of one-third of
the annuity which is normally entitled to receive; and ( b) in any other
case, the commuted value of one-half of such annuity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#25:1>
Such commuted value of annuity being determined having regard to
the age of the recipient, the state of his health, the rate of interest and
officially recognised tables of mortality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#26:1>
The commuted value of annuity, as specified in rule 90, is exempt
from the income tax, and only payment of annuity made to the employee or his
dependants are treated as salary income for the purposes of tax. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#27:1>
The Life Insurance Corporation of India offers two types of
superannuation plans: </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#28:1>
<h> 1. <bold> Money purchase scheme </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#29:1>
The rate of contribution payable by the employers in respect of
its employees it decided in advance in relation to his salary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#30:1>
As per the present provision of the Income tax Rules, such rate of
contribution cannot exceed 15 per cent of the salary, if the <w> employer's
</w> contribution to provident fund is equivalent to 10 per cent of the <w>
employee's </w> salary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#31:1>
The total contribution made by an employer towards superannuation and
recognised provident fund cannot exceed 25 per cent of the <w> employee's
</w> salary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#32:1>
The contribution made by the employer is utilised by <mention> LIC
</mention> to secure appropriate pension. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#33:1>
<h> 2. <bold> Benefit purchase scheme </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#34:1>
The amount of annuity is invested by the employer in advance <O>
<&> page </&> 943 </O> in relation to the salary by an employee in the year
of retirement or the average salary drawn in the last 3 or 5 years, prior to
retirement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#35:1>
For example, 2 per cent of the annual salary for each year of
service, subject to a maximum of 60 per cent of the salary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#36:1>
LIC will determine the premium payable with respect to the employees.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#37:1>
The employee has also the option to elect any one of the
following types of annuities:

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#38:1>
( <roman> 1 </roman> ) Annuity payable throughout his life time;

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#39:1>
( <roman> 2 </roman> )

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#40:1>
Annuity payable during his life time, but also guaranteed for a
specific minimum number of years ( 5, 10 & 15 years ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#41:1>
If he dies during the guaranteed period, the annuity will continue to
be paid to his beneficiary for remaining part of the period;

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#42:1>
( <roman> 3 </roman> ) Annuity is payable throughout his life time
with death benefit equivalent to purchase price along with <mention> GPT
</mention> Bonus;

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#43:1>
( <roman> 4 </roman> )

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#44:1>
Annuity payable during the joint life time of the employee and his
wife, and continue thereafter during the life time of the survival: and

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#45:1>
( <roman> 5 </roman> )

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#46:1>
In the event of cessation of service or death of a member while in
service, prior to superannuation age, the moneys standing to the credit of
the employee would be utilised to provide pension to him or to his
beneficiary, as the case maybe. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#47:1>
<h> <bold> JEEVAN DHARA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#48:1>
The Life Insurance Corporation of India introduced a new
financial instrument known as <it> <quote> <mention> " Jeevan Dhara"
</mention> </quote> </it> for ensuring regular payment of annuity to persons
at the time of their retirement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#49:1>
<mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> offers the following additional
benefits:

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#50:1>
- - Attractive annuity rates;

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#51:1>
- - Enhancement of <it> <quote> ` GIVE' </quote> </it> ( Gross
Insurance Value Element) at the time of verifying by way of bonus which
correspondingly increases the annuity; and

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#52:1>
- - On death after annuity payment commences, enhanced <it> GIVE
</it> with an additional lump sum bonus is payable to the heirs. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#53:1>
<h> <bold> COMPARATIVE STUDY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#54:1>
For the purposes of this study, the rate of return under the <w>
LlC's </w> new annuity plan has been compared with <w> <mention> LlC's
</mention> </w> annuity plan guaranteed for 15 years certain and life
thereafter and <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#55:1>
<h> <bold> ASSUMPTIONS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#56:1>
The following assumptions are made for the purposes of comparing
the rate of return under the Group Superannuation Scheme and <mention> Jeevan
Dhara </mention> :

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#57:1>
( a) The normal date of retirement has been taken as 55 years in both
Group Superannuation Scheme and <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#58:1>
The rate of contribution, which is limited to 15 per cent of the <w>
employee's </w> annual salary as provided in Rule 88 of the Income-tax Rules,
have been pre-determined till the age of retirement of an employee;

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#59:1>
( b) An employee receives gratuity at the time of his retirement; and

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#60:1>
( c) An employee commutes his/her annuity at the time of retirement,
as such commutation is not subject to income-tax. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#61:1>
<h> <bold> NEW ANNUITY PLAN v. ANNUITY GUARANTEED FOR 15 YEARS
CERTAIN AND LIFE THEREAFTER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#62:1>
It will be seen from the table <it> ( published on page 946 )
</it> that an employee entering the scheme at the age of 25 years on a salary
of Rs. 6000 per month, the cash accumulation under the 15 years scheme, on
contribution remitted @ 15 per cent of salary for a deferment period of 30
years would be Rs. 20,86,492.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#63:1>
The employee would also be eligible to commute one-third of the cash
accumulation standing to his credit at the time of retirement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#64:1>
The annuity payable, if an employee commutes one-third of his
annuity, would be Rs. 13,395 per month guaranteed for a period of 15 years
and life thereafter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#65:1>
However, if an employee dies, say, at the age of 65 years, his / her
beneficiary / nominee would receive annuity only for the balance period of 5
years under this plan, and thereafter, the payment of annuity will cease.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#66:1>
Thus, the sums receivable in the event of death of an employee would
work out to Rs. 14,99,197 ( annuity of Rs. 8,03,700 calculated @ Rs. 13,395
per month for the balance period of 5 years plus commuted value of annuity
amounting to Rs. 6,95,497.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#67:1>
In other words, under the scheme, <mention> LIC </mention> would be
appropriating Rs. 5,87,395 otherwise would have been legally payable to the
nominee / beneficiary of the employee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#68:1>
At all age and income levels, there is a loss of capital amounting to
<indig> lacs </indig> of rupees under this plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#69:1>
In the new annuity plan, the sums receivable in the event of
death of an employee would be Rs. 13,90,995, if an employee commutes his
annuity at the time of retirement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#70:1>
The total sums receivable on account of commutation of annuity and
the sums receivable by the legal heirs would be Rs. 20,86,492 as against Rs.
6,95,497 ( commuted value of annuity) offered under the 15 years scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#71:1>
There is, thus, a net gain of Rs. 13,90,995 in the new annuity plan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#72:1>
It will be seen from the table that for all age and income levels,
the sum receivable under the new plan is higher compared to the annuity plan
guaranteed for 15 years certain and life thereafter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#73:1>
This is primarily because of the provision of full return of capital
under the new annuity plan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#74:1>
In the annuity plan for 15 years certain and life thereafter, 66.66
per cent or 50 per cent of the capital, as the case may be, is appropriated
by <mention> LIC </mention> by virtue of mandatory provisions of rules 89 and
91 of the Income tax Rules. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#75:1>
In the example quoted above, the annuity payable under the new
plan would be Rs. 12,096 per month as against Rs. 13,395 per month in 15
years plan, i.e., a net loss of annuity amounting to Rs. 1299 per month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#76:1>
Although, lot of important features have been introduced under the
new annuity plan like return of capital with terminal bonus in the event of
death of an employee, there appears to be a considerable reduction in the
matter of payment of annuity to the employees as compared to the 15 years
guaranteed scheme. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#77:1>
<h> <bold> NEW ANNUITY PLAN v JEEVAN DHARA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-019#78:1>
The rate of return on sums invested in <it> <mention> Jeevan
Dhara </mention> </it> is comparatively higher to the return offered under
the new annuity plan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#79:1>
For example, for an employee entering the scheme at the age of 25 on
a salary of Rs. 6,000 per month, the payment of annuity at the end of
deferment period in <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> would be Rs. 22,686 per
month as against Rs. 19,051 per month ( annuity plus interest on commuted
value of annuity ) under the new annuity plan; a net gain of Rs. 3,635 per
month in <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> <O> <&> page </&> 944 </O> policy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#80:1>
Similarly, the sums receivable by the nominee / beneficiary in the
event of death of an employee under <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> would
be Rs. 22,68,611 as against Rs. 20,86,492 under the new annuity plan: a net
gain of Rs. 1,81,690.

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#81:1>
It will be seen from the table that for all age and income levels,
the sums receivable under the new plan is much less compared to <mention>
Jeevan Dhara </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#82:1>
Similarly, there is also a reduction in the payment of annuity for
all age and income levels, as compared to annuity offered under <mention>
Jeevan Dhara </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-019#83:1>
The only drawback in the <mention> Jeevan Dhara </mention> policy is
that there is no provision for commutation of annuity, which is available in
the new annuity plan. </p> </I>
