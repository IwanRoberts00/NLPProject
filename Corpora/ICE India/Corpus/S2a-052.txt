<ICE-IND:S2A-052#1:1:A>
It is commonly believed that the only way to cook <indig> kabab
</indig> is in a <indig> tandoor </indig> or on a grill <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#2:1:A>
Nothing could be farther from the truth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#3:1:A>
There are several ways to cook <indig> kabab </indig> <,> and there
are many <indig> kabab </indig> which can be cooked in several ways <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#4:1:A>
To cite an example the <indig> tikka </indig> of kid or lamb <,> can
be roasted in the <indig> tandoor </indig> <,> cooked on a grilled <,>
shallow fried on a girdle <,> or in the Rajastani style cooked in a <indig>
hundi </indig> or pot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#5:1:A>
There is another fine example where <indig> tikka </indig> or fish
<,> or can be grilled in the <indig> tandoor </indig> <,> or as in the case
of uh <indig> Amritsari machali </indig> deep fried in a <indig> kadhai
</indig> which is a <O> one word </O> of worth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#6:1:A>
Moreover let me assure you <,> that <indig> kabab </indig> cooked on
grills <,> with those and in <indig> kadhai </indig> are as popular as those
roasted in the <indig> tandoor </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#7:1:A>
Yet <,> it is the <indig> tandoori kabab </indig> especially <indig>
tandoori </indig> chicken <,> which helped Indian cuisine build its
international reputation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#8:1:A>
Based upon the success <,> Indian masters not only gave a
gastronomic accent to the rustic <indig> kabab </indig> <,,> but created
delicacies so sublime and subtle <,,> that they expand best selling
restaurants which made curry <,,> places curry houses look ordinary in
comparison

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#9:1:A>
At least as far as the bottom line was concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#10:1:A>
Hi Manjeet <,> why so smug ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#11:1:B>
Hi Jack <,> not smug but satisfied <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-052#12:1:B>

<,> when there was <,> nothing for vegetarian and today <,> today it has much
more to offer
