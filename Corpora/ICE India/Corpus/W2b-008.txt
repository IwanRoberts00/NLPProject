<h> <bold> Shakespeare and politics </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#2:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> DURING </smallcaps> </bold> my recent visit to
Stratford-upon-Avon to attend and give a paper at the conference of <w>
Shakespeare's </w> scholars, I could not imagine my stay abroad without being
able to be exposed to the media obsessed with the reunification of Germany
and the Gulf crisis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#3:1>
Appropriately, the title of the conference was <quote> " Shakespeare
and Politics" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#4:1>
Shakespeare has many adjectives like <quote> " vile" " scurvy"
</quote> to describe a politician and he had scant regard for judges, who
dressed with brief little authority played ducks and drakes with the lives of
people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#5:1>
The media did not bother about the Shakespeare conference. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#6:1>
I had a busy week attending and giving a lecture, participating
in seminars and going to the theatre to see <w> Shakespeare's </w> plays at
Swan and National theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#7:1>
Radio and television put out the news on the German reunification and
the Gulf crisis, hour after hour, Saddam who had not <quote> " changed from
bad old days" </quote> , the disappearance of the Wall and the German
reunification. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#8:1>
At <w> Holl's </w> Croft Club where <w> Shakespeare's </w>
son-in-law lived, now a very academic place, we discussed <it> Troilus and
Cressida </it> a play that we watched at the Swan theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#9:1>
There was heated discussion on <w> Cressida's </w> infidelity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#10:1>
It looked as if Cressida played by Amanda Root came alive to the
discussion table, the Greeks and Trojans were imagined to be haunting and
alive, as alive as the American troops around the Gulf.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#11:1>
The discussion highlighted passages of moral truths and political
wisdom, the <w> Ulysses's </w> speech on degree and the universal obligation
of the law of order which when disturbed lead to chaos. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#12:1>
With business slowly fading into pleasure we went to
Shakespeare centre were there is a blind statue of the poet,
symbolising an eternal inward eye, a well stocked library where one could
feel, as if the ashes of Shakespeare kept perched in the urns among the book
shelves were burning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#13:1>
The members of the conference cut across a wide range of disciplines
which explains the absence fo intellectual parochialism and professional
jealousy one normally encountters at meetings of similar organisations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#14:1>
Hence the topics of discussion acquired topical interest : <quote>
" Shylock and the discourse of terrorism" </quote> , <quote> " Julius Ceasar
and the conspriators" </quote> , <quote> " Macbeth and MacBird : the dark
side of human nature." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#15:1>
<it> MacBird </it> by Barbara Garson is a political satire in the
model of Aristophanes written to shock respectability of President Johnson
and his involvement in the Vietnam during the latter part of the <w> 1960's
</w> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#16:1>
It is indebted to <it> Macbeth </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#17:1>
Discussions embodied references to the events of the day - - the
Gulf crisis and the German reunification.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#18:1>
Even the production of <it> King Lear </it> had a slight stint
towards contempo rary events. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#19:1>
The Stratford <it> Lear </it> was visibly happier to present the
division of the kingdom as a family row rather than a conclusion of State.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#20:1>
The Director, Nicholas Hytner, was clearly interested in the dynastic
dimension : the power-struggle between the <w> king's </w> daughters and
their faction in Act Four goes for little. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#21:1>
The politics of the family were another matter, and the first two
acts offered some penetrating suggestions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#22:1>
Unlike Peter <w> Brooke's </w> production of 1962, which <O> <*>
line across column 2 & 3</*> </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#23:1>
<bold> by H. H. Anniah Gowda </bold> </O> <O> <*> line across column
2 & 3</*> </O> was famous for refusing to endorse <w> Lear's </w> claim
that he is a man more sinned against than sinning and for suggesting that
there might be something to be said for Goneril and Regan after all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#24:1>
As now played by Estelle Kohler and Sally Dexter, they were certainly
more psychologically plausible than the pelican daughters of tradition.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#25:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> IT </smallcaps> </bold> would have been strange,
of course, if an English Sunday paper would not have carried an article about
Germany or the Gulf crisis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#26:1>
The <it> <mention> Sunday Times </mention> </it> , however, seemed to
have difficulties to mention the rest of the world at all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#27:1>
But <w> India's </w> cricket performance received its share.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#28:1>
The news review section devoted almost a full page to a laudation of
the German ambassador in London and middle page describing Saddam Hussain
as <quote> " a wolf with manicured claws" </quote> and sanctions against
Iraq. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#29:1>
There was some praise for <w> Jordan's </w> King <w> Hussain's
</w> abortive peace efforts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#30:1>
But I was puzzled at the laudatory article on Kohl - - and certainly
not in an English newspaper about a German politician.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#31:1>
<w> Saddam's </w> portrait was of his having borrowed his cigar from
Churchhill, his sword from <}> <-> Harum-al-Rashid </-> <+> Harun-ul-Rashid
</+> </}> , and his hat from Roosevelt.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#32:1>
He deserves the attack for having disturbed the wrld. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#33:1>
I turned the page only to encounter the Nicholas Garland cartoon
of Chancellor Kohl a Hitler moustache and a slapdash lock for hair which
accompanied the <it> <mention> Spectator </mention> </it> interview with
Nicholas Ridley which caused his downfall probably more than the outrageous
words which he had uttered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#34:1>
But that was not the end of the teutomania or obsession with the
Gulf to the exclusion of other world news which the <it> <mention> Sunday
Times </mention> </it> displayed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#35:1>
The focus section contained not less than two pages in which <quote>
" five eminent young Germans" </quote> were giving advice to the British
Prime Minister how to run Britain in a more efficient way, in other words,
how to imitate the sucessful Germans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#36:1>
The word <quote> " ougrageous" </quote> renders the tone of
the article itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#37:1>
My German colleagues found what Ridley said almost refreshing and
more honest than the diplomatic statements one is likely to hear over the
radio and television. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#38:1>
There we were in Stratford without an Indian newspaper we did not
need it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#39:1>
The English papers were full of German and the Gulf stuff.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#40:1>
I was reminded of a character in <it> <mention> <w> All's </w> Well
that Ends Well </it> </mention> , <quote> " Is not a language I speak? - - A
most harsh one." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#41:1>
At Stratford, Lafeu did not recognise us talk about harsh language
enough for academic discussion, applying Shakespeare to contemporary
events. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#42:1>
From a French colleague, I borrowed <it> <mention> Paris-March
</mention> </it> once again to read of Chancellor Kohl and Saddam Hussein who
dominated the Western press : one is praised and the other is blamed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#43:1>
The entire society is to be viewed as a scene from shakespeare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#44:1>
For one who participated in the conference on <quote> " Shakespeare
and Politics" </quote> , the world scene gathered from the English
newspapers, can be summed up in <w> Touchstone's </w> wise saying, <quote>
" I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#45:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ALTHOUGH </smallcaps> </bold> the spirit of the
text was violated, one felt the relevance of Shakespeare to <w> today's </w>
world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#46:1>
One of the strengths of John <w> Wood's </w> <it> Lear </it> was that
he made it immediately clear that the old man was becoming - - has
probably long been - - impossible to live with.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#47:1>
It was made out that the way the sisters behaved was his fault.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#48:1>
As in Shakespeare <it> Lear </it> had lost his marbles, and the power
of intellectual consistency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#49:1>
However, the insanity that John Wood so intellilgently
signalled proved disappointing in the theatrical event because it became
increasingly difficult to distinguish between the self regard of the
character and that of the actor playing him.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#50:1>
There was a lack of emotional penetration in the reunion with
Cordelia and fine moment of speculative in tensity when he talked of
him self and Cordelia being <w> God's </w> spies, prepared to take <w>
upon's </w> the mystery of things; but not enough sense, earlier of a sudden
access of compassion for the poor naked wretches caught in the pitiless
storm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#51:1>
He was clearly fascinated by the unaccommodated man that Edgar
has made himself into, but the tone of <quote> " Is man no more than this?"
</quote> was rather one of academic interest than of mystical insight or
appalled revelation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#52:1>
<quote> " As flies to boys are we to the Gods?" </quote> indicates
the helplessness of its victims, and the <w> tragedy's </w> almost
intolerable extremism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#53:1>
<w> Lear's </w> violent speeches, the <w> play's </w> gigantism,
its expansiveness and its implied lesson of abdication came close to the
modern thinking.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#54:1>
Walking out of the theatre and musing on the deeply felt episodes,
sauntering along the river Thames and watching the swans swimming and the
memorial to Shakespeare with some of his characters all around the Hamlet,
in particular, with the <w> Yorrick's </w> skull in hand philosophising
made us forget the <w> day's </w> chores but the political events
demonstrated that the heads which wore the crown were uneasy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#55:1>
When I came to my lodging, I came across copies of the <it> Times
</it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#56:1>
One of our British colleagues had told us that on Sundays an
intellectual had to read the <it> <mention> Times </mention> </it> and the
newly launched <it> <mention> The Independent </mention> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#57:1>
The world news section of the <it> <mention> Times </mention> </it>
carried an article on Helmut Kohl with the heading <quote> " Kohl gets
bigger every day." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#58:1>
It was wisely timed because the German Chancellor had gone from the
Caucasus to Lake Wolfgangsee in Austria where he tries to lose weight and
normally succeeds for a week or two. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#59:1>
All world politicians in power take a holiday.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#60:1>
President George Bush goes to the family seaside holiday home at
Maine, where he heard the disturbing news from the Gulf and others have their
places of choice.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#61:1>
No irony could be found in the article on Kohl.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#62:1>
However, it was full of admiration and praise for the man who was
emerging with startling rapidity as <w> Europe's </w> Number One.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#63:1>
This was corroborated with glee by my German colleague and who
like other intellectuals believed in the dictum of Arnold that the moment
produces the man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#64:1>
There is Kohl on the tide of history. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#65:1>
On the same page John Cassidly was reporting from New York
that the Caucasus conference had put American noses out of joint and had
created a new Raphallo - - like arrangement between Bonn and Moscow.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#66:1>
Once again I was looking in vain for a glance of irony or a grain of
criticism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#67:1>
Rather, so it seemed to me did the author express a certain <it>
<foreign> Schadenfreude </foreign> </it> because Germany now seemed to be
able to achieve what England could not do after the second world war : it
emancipates itself from American supremacy. </p> </I>

<bold> Financial </bold> and commercial ties are important.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#70:2>
But infinitely more important are cultural and spiritual ties which
cannot be measured in terms of money.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#71:2>
Of all our trading partners Japan has the closest cultural and
spiritual ties with India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#72:2>
Now that India has adopted globalization as its official policy, this
is the time to strengthen the bonds between the two countries which are
<quote> " eternal friends, natural partners" </quote> in the words of Toshio
Yamanouchi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#73:2>
It is remarkable how many common creative wavelengths have
been sought over the centuries by Japan and India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#74:2>
Between the two countries we can complete the Story of the Beautiful
- - hewn in the marbles of the Taj Mahal and embroidered with birds and
flowers upon the fan of Hokusai at the foot of Fujiyama. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#75:2>
The Japanese have studied our civilization and absorbed its
values.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#76:2>
We would be well advised to study their civilization and
assimilate its values.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#77:2>
What a transformation would take place on the Indian scene if we
had the humility to learn and translate into action the priceless lessons
which Japan has to teach us.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#78:2>
For instance, we should study carefully the Japanese system of
partnership between the public and private sectors and between the
employer and the employee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#79:2>
Again, there is no highly developed country where litigation
is so infrequent as it is in Japan.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#80:2>
The total number of lawyers in that country being only 14,000, there
is no lawyer-stimulated litigation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#81:2>
Japan has a history, as interesting and variegated as that of
India, going back about 2,600 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#82:2>
In the nineteenth century, Japan effectively abolished feudalism,
serfdom, and slavery, as it was abolished in France in 1789, in Russia in
1862, and in the USA in 1863.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#83:2>
In India, slavery and untouchability have been abolished only on
paper by the Constitution in 1950.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#84:2>
The ambition of Japan now is to be transformed from a mere economic
powerhouse into a <quote> " lifestyle superpower" </quote> by the early
twenty-first century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#85:2>
The two largest democraies of Asia are Japan and India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#86:2>
Unfortunately, neither has great moral leadership at present, (
for that master, no democracy in the world has today great moral
leadership.)

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#87:2>
But in Japan this desideratum does not have discernible ill-effects
because the people are totally disciplined, <O> photograph </O> characterised
by exemplary dedication, and there is hundred per cent literacy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#88:2>
By contract, we Indians, who lack discipline and dedication and
have at least half of our population literally illiterate, find ourselves
rudderless in the absence of moral leadership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#89:2>
We suffer acutely from four plagues - - regionalism,
communalism, casteism, and corruption.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#90:2>
There are various categories of democracies - - democracies, guided
democracies, and misguided democracies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#91:2>
The four plagues have made it possible for self-seeking politicians
to convert our democracy into a misguided democracy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#92:2>
India produced Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest moral force of this
century, but today it is pathetically lacking even in mediocre moral
leadership. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#93:2>
Some years ago, when the population of India was a little over
600 million and that of Japan 100 million, the then Japanese Ambassador
delivered a frank talk in Bombay and invited questions from the audience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#94:2>
A young Indian got up and asked, <quote> " We Indians are no less
intelligent than you the Japanese; how is it that you are on top of the world
and we are still <O> <*> a red line below the column </*> </O> <O> continued
on page 8 </O> <O> continued from page 1 </O> <O> <*> line below the column
</*> </O> wallowing in poverty?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#95:2>
The amlbassador gave a very pithy and pregnant answer, <quote> "
My young friend, the explanation is simple.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#96:2>
In Japan we have 100 million <bold> citizens </bold> ; in India you
have 600 million <bold> individuals </bold> ." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#97:2>
The Japanese are, by nature, clean, honest and like to remain on
the right side of the law.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#98:2>
Cleanliness comes as naturally to the Japanese as filth and
slovenliness come to large segments of the Indian people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#99:2>
Seven hundred and fifty million Indians live with no access to basic
sanitation, according to the latest Human Development Report of the
United Nations Development Programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#100:2>
By temperament the Japanese are lawabiding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#101:2>
A historian wrote some years ago: <quote> " I have lived in
districts where no case of theft had occurred for hundreds of years, where
the newly-built prisons of Meiji remained empty and useless". </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#102:2>
It can be said without exaggeration that of all the resources
with which a national can be blessed, the most valuable, in fact the
invaluable, resource is the character of the people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#103:2>
Among the economically dynamic nations of the world, Japan is
tragically the poorest in fuels and minerals which are indispensable to
industry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#104:2>
But it more than makes up for this deficiency by the character of
the people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#105:2>
Theirs is a homogeneous society with total dedication to their
motherland and an unmatched work ethic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#106:2>
They had the good sense to have ethical socialism which inculcate
social justice to all strata of society, and they practised ethical socialism
during the four decades that India practised ideological socialism which
kept us mired in poverty and squalor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#107:2>
As Ambassador Shunji Kobayashi pointed out three years ago, the
advantage of a low wage level in India is unfortunately offset by the low
productivity level, and an irrational <quote> " exit" </quote> policy which
results in labour being treated like spoilt children, ( Unfortunately,
despite verbal assurances to the contrary, the same pernicious exit policy
still continues). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#108:2>
Japanese manners are a model of diplomatic courtesy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#109:2>
In Japan a formal humility clothes a fierce <O> <&> <bold> Eternal
friends, natural partners </&> </O> <O> photograph of the Buddha </O> <O> map
across column 2 & 3 and on it names of cities </O> <O> caption </O>
self-respect.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#110:2>
As Will Durant points out, the typical Japanese has all the
qualities of a warrior - - pugnacity and courage, and unrivalled readiness
to die; and yet, very often, he has the soul of an artist - - sensuous,
impressionable and almost instinctively possessed of taste.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#111:2>
He is sober and unostentatious, frugal and industrious, curious and
studious, loyal and patient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#112:2>
He has a nimble intelligence, not highly creative in the field of
thought but capable of quick comprehension, adaptation and practical
achievement.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#113:2>
He transforms creatively what he absorbs through imitation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#114:2>
Flowers are the religion of the Japanese; they worship them with
sacrificial fervour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#115:2>
Buddhism which originated in India 2,600 years ago, spread
through China for five centuries and then, in the sixth century A.D., it made
rapid conquest of Japan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#116:2>
There are over one hundred Buddhist sects and groups in Japan
and there are 75,000 Buddhist temples.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#117:2>
Out of a total population of 123 million, no less than 75 million
are Buddhists.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#118:2>
Out of ancestral worship came the older living religion of Japan - -
Shinto - - the Way of the Gods.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#119:2>
The majority of the Japanese believe both in Buddhism and in
their ancient religion, Shintoism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#120:2>
They are generally taken by their parents to be blessed in Shinto
shrines at birth but are given Buddhist funerals when they die. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#121:2>
If only Indian authorities had any imagination and sensitivity,
we would be flooded by a large inflow of Japanese tourists who are keenly
interested in visiting places of interest associated with the Buddha.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#122:2>
But the sad fact is that out of eleven million japanese citizens who
travel abroad every year, less than one <indig> lakh </indig> come to India.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-008#123:2>
I have no doubt that a closer contact with Japan would not only
enrich India economically but enrich Indian life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#124:2>
It would serve as a cleansing influence on our polluted environment
and filthy public places.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#125:2>
It would also uplift our national character and refine our religious
sensitivity to the point where we can have religion in place of religiosity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-008#126:2>
It would also bring home to us the vital difference between
socialism and social justice. </p> <&> <it> ( Mr Palkhivala was in Japan a
few weeks ago as a guest of the Japanese government). </it> </&> </I>
