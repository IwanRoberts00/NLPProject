<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#1:1:A>
Uh <,> right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#2:1:A>
I am Rana Nayar <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#3:1:B>
And I am Sudeep Minhas <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#4:1:A>
So <,> Sudeep what do you think we should talk about this
morning <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#5:1:B>
<w> That's </w> what I am thinking <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#6:1:A>
Why don't you set the ball rolling <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#7:1:B>
<w> That's </w> what I am thinking

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#8:1:B>
<w> Let's </w> talk about feminism

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#9:1:B>
<w> Let's </w> just continue <,,> the <w> yesterday's </w> <,>
discussion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#10:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> very interesting <,> <}> <-> I I </-> <=> I
</=> </}> wasn't participating yesterday <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#11:1:A>
Right

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#12:1:B>
So I <{> <[> would like </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#13:1:A>
<[> But that </[> </{> was <,> uh more personal in nature
because <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#14:1:B>
Yes we won't talk

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#15:1:A>
I was just <,> uh drawing upon my personal <{1> <[1>
experience </[1> and talking about it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#16:1:A>
Uh and how of course I <,> started <{2> <[2> off as the feminist
<,,> and uh became more of a male chauvinist later </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#17:1:B>
<[1> Experience </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#18:1:B>
<[2> <O> A few words </O> </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#19:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#20:1:A>
So <,> why don't you share <,> a bit of <,> your experience
<,> so <{> <[> that we will be on </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#21:1:B>
<[> About feminism </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#22:1:B>
About how <,,> man <{> <[> feel </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#23:1:A>
<[> Even </[> </{> ground <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#24:1:B>
How man feel

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#25:1:A>
How strongly you feel about <,> this whole idea of <{> <[>
feminism </[> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#26:1:B>
<[> Feminism </[> </{> right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#27:1:B>
Uh now <w> I'll </w> we can't say how strongly I feel about it

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#28:1:B>
But I think it <,,> most of the personal experience is that you
slowly <,> begin to realise that <,> being a working woman makes you more of
a <,,> you know <,,> a target of male chauvinism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#29:1:B>
Had I been a <,> housewife I think I would have certainly <,,>
enjoyed more privileges <,> than I do now <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#30:1:A>
Do you regret being a career woman <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#31:1:A>
<{> <[> Is that what you are trying </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#32:1:B>
<[> No I think the satisfaction </[> </{> <,> the satisfaction
for my subject gives me <,> uh I mean <w> it's </w> a kind of <,,> balances
the whole thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#33:1:B>
But sometimes I think <,> uh I certainly wish I just could relax at
home and you know <,,> the chores that I do <,> now I mean <,> if were to do
just those chores and I would feel certainly much more happier <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#34:1:A>
But that will <{1> <[1> not </[1> really make you <,,> uh
feminist <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#35:1:A>
Then then <{2> <[2> what </[2> you are asking for <,> <{> <[> no
<,> is some kind of a <{3> <[3> typical </[3> role that is <{4> <[4> assigned
</[4> to women

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#36:1:B>
<[1> Well I </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#37:1:B>
<[2> No </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#38:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#39:1:B>
<[3> Exactly </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#40:1:B>
<[4> No the </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#41:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> saying I am saying <,,> this is what I had
encountered <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#42:1:B>
Not that I want to be like that

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#43:1:B>
This is what I have encountered from <{> <[> me </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#44:1:A>
<[> Given </[> </{> a choice <,> you won't like

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#45:1:B>
Exactly <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> exactly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#46:1:B>
I mean <,,> uh we have certain dreams I feel all <,> young girls
have certain dreams and uh <,,> then uh <,> when I was about twenty-five
twenty-six <,,> just before my marriage

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#47:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#48:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#49:1:B>
I I had this kind of a dream that <,> okay <w> I'm </w> going
to set certain rules <,> if <w> I'm </w> working <,> and he is working we are
going to divide <,,> uh what we are going to do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#50:1:B>
But I think <,,> and I ended up with a lot of problems <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#51:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#52:1:B>
Got lot of problems

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#53:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#54:1:B>
So I think uhm <,> <w> that's </w> what when you were talking
about yesterday <O> one word </O> better you know that <,,> yes one <,,> sets
out thinking that yes one is <,> feminist but <,,> when actually slowly you
<,> when you when you actually <,,> uh face the realities <,> when you come
down to the ground realities <,,> I think one is so much more happier in the
conventional truth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#55:1:B>
<w> Same's </w> happened with me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#56:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#57:1:B>
When I think it would have been <,> I think my mother is in a
much better position and a situation than I am <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#58:1:B>
She is much more respected <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#59:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#60:1:B>
I am the one who is supposed to be you know <,> going out and
having fun but still I am working the most of the <O> one word </O> you know
<,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#61:1:B>
And my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of
the house

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#62:1:B>
She has so much more respect <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#63:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#64:1:B>
And uh <,> I think I <,> lose out on that

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#65:1:B>
And I sometimes wish and I crave for that kind of <,> an adoration
and looking upto <,> <O> laughter </O> looking upto <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#66:1:A>
Are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become
more of <,,> uh man or more of woman <,> uh <{> <[> is that the </[> idea ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#67:1:B>
<[> Now about the <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#68:1:B>
Yes <,> I mean have we <,> I mean <,> I think had I been given
enough uh <,,> <.> wh </.> what should I say <,,> had the situation been
different <,,> and the convention been different then I would have certainly
loved to be a liberated <,> woman or the <,> or as we say <,,> the working
woman or a professional kind

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#69:1:B>
I would have certainly loved to be that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#70:1:A>
Would you like to say that all <,> working women are liberated
in that sense <{> <[> in your words </[> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#71:1:B>
<[> No they are not </[> </{> no no <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#72:1:A>
Then ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#73:1:B>
I mean I would have loved

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#74:1:A>
Opting for a career only way of seeking liberation <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#75:1:B>
Yes it is of course to <{1> <[1> uh to <.> ce </.> </[1> to a
great extent <,> yes <}> <-> I I </-> <=> I </=> </}> agree <{2> <[2> with
that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing <O> one word </O> </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#76:1:A>
<[1> Is it not </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#77:1:A>
<[2> Uh would you like to think of liberation purely in
ecnomic </[2> </{2> terms

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#78:1:B>
<w> It's >/w> not just that Rana <,> <w> it's </w> not just
that

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#79:1:B>
<w> It's </w> so much more you can <,> I mean sometimes I think you
just tend to <,> uh build a <,> build up so much when you are at home and
this is some kind of an outset

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#80:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> <,> not just economical <w> it's </w>
psychological also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#81:1:B>
And the <,> the very fact of moving out of the house <,> I think
<,,> man enjoys that don't they ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#82:1:B>
I mean you make them sit at home for <,,> uh say about <,> uh uh
not even a week <,> say two days I mean <,> <{> <[> right <,> if they have a
prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get <,> irritated <}> <-> they
</-> <+> <=> they </=> </}> won't move <O> one word </O> <,,> they feel
confined <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#83:1:B>
I think <,> the very fact <,> you know this <,> this <,> breaking
of the psychological barrier yes that <,> even I am moving out <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#84:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#85:1:A>
Right

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#86:1:B>
This is physical moving out <,> is sometime equated <,> uh
with the <,> with the psychological uh <,> opening up <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#87:1:A>
Right <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#88:1:B>
Right <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> I mean you can carry on <,> <{2>
<[2> uhm <,> I mean I don't know what to think about that <,> <O> laughter
</O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#89:1:B>
I hope

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#90:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#91:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#92:1:A>
Of course we can always <,,> agree to differ <,> <{1> <[1> as
far </[1> this <{2> <[2> is concerned because </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#93:1:B>
<[1> Oh yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#94:1:B>
<[2> Why not why </[2> </{2> not why not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#95:1:B>
Of course he has got an absolutely different <,> uh say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#96:1:A>
No because I am a staunch believer in uh <,> what I call <,>
biological determinant <,> <{> <[> you see </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#97:1:B>
<[> Now what </[> </{> is biological determinant ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#98:1:B>
<{> <[> Please explain that you were saying yesterday also </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#99:1:A>
<[> Uh I know uh uh I know </[> </{> I know <O> laughter </O>
I know I am going to raise lot of hackles when I say that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#100:1:A>
But this is exactly what <,,> uh what my life experience is that
<,,> things are what they are because of <,> <.> bio </.> biology and biology
is what conditions are <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#101:1:A>
And we cannot really be any different <,> or we cannot really go
very far <,,> from <,> <{> <[> where we start </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#102:1:B>
<[> I think don't </[> </{> we give meanings to <,> biology
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#103:1:B>
I think let to itself it would have been much more simpler

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#104:1:B>
I mean <,> it would have been much more <,,> uh on the equal
ground had <,> I mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#105:1:A>
I am not really trying to

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#106:1:B>
And this is <,> I don't know anything about <{> <[>
biological determinism exactly </[> <,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#107:1:B>
I have no <,> scholarly <,> <O> laughs </O> background about this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#108:1:A>
<[> So do impose and stuck upon </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#109:1:A>
Nor do I for that matter

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#110:1:B>
And <O> two words </O> justify thing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#111:1:A>
And if <,> not really meant be scholarly discussion but <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#112:1:B>
I know <,> no <,> but still I don't what it is <,,> but I
<,,> somehow feel personally that we give a lot of meaning <,,> because <w>
that's </w> the way we want it to be <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#113:1:B>
<w> That's </w> the way our <,,> society wants it to be <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#114:1:A>
Yeah <,> that would be another way of looking at it but uh
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#115:1:B>
You mean biologically men are stronger than women ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#116:1:A>
I am not <.> talk </.> talking in terms of relative strength
<,> that men are <,> stronger and women are weaker <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#117:1:A>
But <,> what I am trying to suggest is that <,> whether it is
psychology or <,> sociology <,> or cultural pattern <,> or behaviourial
pattern <,> all stem from <,,> a certain kind of biological makeup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#118:1:A>
Everything else follows <,> you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#119:1:A>
Everything else comes later <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#120:1:A>
It begins there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#121:1:B>
No I think <{1> <[1> it </[1> begins <{2> <[2> no no no </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#122:1:A>
<[1> And </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#123:1:A>
<[2> And and </[2> </{2> perhaps <{1> <[1> you see </[1> <}>
<-> when when </-> <=> when </=> </}> women talk in terms of <,> liberation
uh <,,> <.> ar </.> are they talking in terms of being <,,> more of men than
<,> women

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#124:1:A>
Is that what they want <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#125:1:A>
Equality with men <,> does it mean that <,> they want to be like
men <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#126:1:A>
I I would not really be very happy with that kind of situation <,>
if women were to be <,> like men <,> or <{2> <[2> where try </[2> to become
men <,> because

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#127:1:B>
<[1> I feel </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#128:1:B>
<[2> This is I can I </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#129:1:B>
<w> That's </w> true <,> I mean they

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#130:1:A>
As far as that goes <,,> reversal of roles can never take
place <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#131:1:B>
I I uh <{> <[> I <-> am </-> agree </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#132:1:A>
<{> <[> For instance </[> one of the extreme is <,> one of
the extreme <,> position that I think of is that <,> man can never give birth

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#133:1:B>
I was thinking of it <,> I was thinking <{> <[> of it </[>
<,> so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#134:1:A>
<[> So to say </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#135:1:A>
You see that is something which <,> <{> <[> women </[> alone
can do

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#136:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#137:1:B>
But that does not

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#138:1:A>
Call it a previlege or <,> whatever <,> <{> <[> yes <,> but
<w> it's </w> granted only to uh <,> I think men are <,> poorer for this
reason <,> that they are <,> they cannot give birth

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#139:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#140:1:B>
No but <w> that's </w> <{1> <[1> I think </[1> that is a <{2>
<[2> very fine </[2> way of saying we <{3> <[3> are poor so we </[3> should
be allowed to do this <{4> <[4> we should </[4> be allowed to do this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#141:1:A>
<[1> Because </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#142:1:A>
<[2> Because </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#143:1:A>
<[3> This is this is </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#144:1:A>
<[4> This is </[4> </{4>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#145:1:A>
One way in which they can somehow satisfy <,> a creative
impulse <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#146:1:A>
A man is always trying to <,> <O> laughs </O> give expression to
it in so many different ways

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#147:1:A>
And I think half the time he doesn't succeed <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#148:1:B>
I don't know about that problem but I think you know <,,> uh
<O> laughter </O> <w> what's </w> more important is as I was saying <,> the
husband is <O> one word </O> <,> I mean as you were saying about this
reversal of role <,> I believe in it <,> yes and I think <,> that should not
be <,,> just by giving birth I think she should not be denied <,> of other
things

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#149:1:B>
I mean I think she feels proud of it yes <,> that she is a mother
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#150:1:B>
And it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of
relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of
<,> <{> <[> right <,> but it develops slowly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#151:1:B>
But <,> again <,> is that an excuse for her <,> not <,> being <,>
I mean <,> so that she should not be taking <,> such and such role <,> she
should not be doing this and this thing <,> is that some kind of a constraint

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#152:1:B>
Just because she happens to be a mother

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#153:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#154:1:A>
Certainly not <,,> and I want <,> I don't even want to <,>
suggest that <,> it should be <,> a kind of a constraint <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#155:1:A>
The idea is <,> you first identify yourself with what you are

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#156:1:A>
You accept yourself for what you are

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#157:1:B>
Yes right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#158:1:A>
You accept your limitations <,> you accept your strength <,>
and from there you proceed <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#159:1:B>
Very fine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#160:1:A>
You see <,> a woman <,> may be or a man for that matter let
me not talk <,,> only of women <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#161:1:A>
If a man also wants to <,,> liberate himself then I think every
man needs to liberate himself or <,> all human beings need to liberate
themselves because <,> all of us have this basic impulse <,> to move towards
some kind of an autonomy <,> growth <,> <{> <[> may be </[> this is something
that we all <,> think about

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#162:1:A>
And this is <,> exactly what I mean by liberation <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#163:1:B>
<[> Exactly </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#164:1:B>
Exactly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#165:1:A>
Moving towards some kind of a higher state <,> <{> <[> yes
<,> of growth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#166:1:A>
Growth which you may measure in <,> whatever terms you <,> chose
to <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#167:1:A>
First <O> one word </O> maybe <,> social <,> psychological <,>
spiritual <,> material <,,> any term you chose to

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#168:1:A>
Terms you can define for yourself

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#169:1:A>
But <,> I am talking about the basic idea of growth <,> and that
alone <,,> means liberation to me

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#170:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#171:1:B>
Exactly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#172:1:A>
So <,> for that kind of growth I think <w> it's </w> very
important <,> I mean <w> that's </w> the way I look at it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#173:1:A>
For a man and <,> for that matter even a woman <,> to accept <,>
himself herself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#174:1:A>
And this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really
count most <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#175:1:B>
Exactly as it is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#176:1:A>
Which becomes a hindrance <,> in a way <,> <{> <[> and </[>
this in itself is a kind of bondage <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#177:1:B>
<[> I </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#178:1:B>
Right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#179:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> give you <,> <w> I'll </w> give you <,> uh a
personal example for that matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#180:1:B>
When you were saying that <,> when woman want to be <,> uh woman
want to be liberated <,> are they trying to be like man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#181:1:B>
I will give you an example <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#182:1:B>
My husband <,> likes <,,> a very clean house

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#183:1:B>
He <,> likes to remain at home <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#184:1:B>
He likes to do all the things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#185:1:B>
And believe it he loves to do needle work also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#186:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#187:1:B>
I don't <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#188:1:B>
I am the one who would rather sit and have a <O> one word </O>
newspaper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#189:1:B>
Yes I love to <,> that is one thing I like to <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#190:1:B>
But he <}> <-> do </-> <+> does </+> </}> all the other things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#191:1:B>
Whenever we are together <,,> on the weekend

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#192:1:B>
You know <,> thinking <,> is generally thought to be a <w> man's
</w> priority <,> right <,> I I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#193:1:A>
Not necessarily <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#194:1:B>
No yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#195:1:A>
Not necessarily

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#196:1:B>
Yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-079#197:1:B>
I I I <,> you know I will give you <{> <[> so many examples from
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#198:1:A>
<[> Men are warriors not </[> </{> thinkers <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-079#199:1:B>
No <,> <O> laughter </O> </I>
