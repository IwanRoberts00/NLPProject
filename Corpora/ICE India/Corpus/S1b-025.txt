<ICE-IND:S1B-025#1:1:Z>
This is All India Radio <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#2:1:Z>
Taking sides <,,> in our national programme tonight we bring you a
discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the
electronic media <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#3:1:Z>
Since only the very rich can afford these private channels <,> will
the content of their programme reflect their bias <,,> and the bias of the
advertisers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#4:1:Z>
The programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#5:1:Z>
All those who run these channels <,> be persuaded to aim them at the
poor <,> and the backward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#6:1:Z>
We view the electronic media <,> as an instrument of social and
economic upliftment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#7:1:Z>
In short will the social attitude and economic compulsions <,> of
the fourth estate <,> force them <,> as it has in the past <,> to take sides
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#8:1:Z>
Taking part in the discussion are Kuldeep Nayyar <,> the emminent
<,> coloumnist <,> Madhu Trehan <,> executive producer News Track <,> P C
Chatterji former director general All India Radio <,> and <,> B G Verghese
<,> the noted columnist who also moderates the discussion <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#9:1:B>
We are discussing this evening <,> uh social attitudes <,> on
the part of the media <,> uh broadcast <,> print and the other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#10:1:B>
But the very main point to start with <-> the </-> is the
discussion that has been initiated <,,> uh rising out of the congress
manifesto <,> which suggest <,> the need for privatisation <,> uh
broadcasting or atleast <,> some competitive challenge through public <,>
co-operation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#11:1:B>
Will this really change <,> broadcasting <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#12:1:B>
Will the content of programmes <,> undergo any change <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#13:1:B>
And will the viewers and listeners get something more <,,>
different <,> from what they get now <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#14:1:B>
Uh Madhu <,> what do you think <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#15:1:A>
<}> <-> First </-> <=> first </=> </}> of all I think the
government has to make its position clear <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#16:1:A>
Nothing has been clarified by the minister <,> about what exactly
they are planning to do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#17:1:A>
Uh there is a lot of confusion and if <,> this is any indication
for what the new channel is going to be like I don't think there will be much
opening up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#18:1:A>
First of all they have to take a <}> <-> <.> de </.> </-> <=>
decision </=> </}> on whether they are going to clear <indig> Doordarshan
</indig> <,> because if they do open up a second channel as it should be <,>
as one <O> one word </O> a free channel <,> then who would watch <indig>
Doordarshan </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#19:1:A>
So they have to take a very gutsy decision <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#20:1:A>
We are <O> two words </O> <indig> Doordarshan </indig> to open up a
channel

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#21:1:A>
I don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in India
today

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#22:1:B>
I <O> a few words </O> suggestion that the <,> government
channel <,> state channel existing channel be extinguished <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#23:1:B>
<indig> Prasar Bharati </indig> <,> will take over

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#24:1:B>
That will be <,> there will be a transformation <,> as far as All
India Radio and <indig> Doordarshan </indig> are concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#25:1:B>
And then the other will be a private or competitive channel or
channels <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#26:1:A>
But who will watch it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#27:1:A>
Who will watch <,> uh <indig> Doordarshan </indig> when you have a
private channel to compete ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#28:1:B>
Well <w> let's </w> ask Kuldeep <,> and

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#29:1:C>
Then they will have to improve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#30:1:C>
Actually the analysis is <,> if <indig> Doordarshan </indig> is
just like what it is today nobody will <,> switch it on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#31:1:C>
But uh <,> if there is a private uh <,,> channel which is producing
a better programme naturally <indig> Doordarshan </indig> will have to <,>
produce better <,> or not to <,> see it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#32:1:C>
But George <,> I don't know <,> my feeling is <indig> ki </indig>
this <,> whole thing <,,> is being confused purposely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#33:1:C>
I think the government does not want to impliment any <indig>
Prasar Bharati </indig> Bill <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#34:1:C>
And the whole thing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#35:1:B>
<O> A few words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#36:1:C>
<w> I'm </w> sorry <w> I'm </w> sorry <,> <w> it's </w> a mess
now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#37:1:C>
So <-> it </-> the whole thing has been introduced just to delay
<,> postpone things

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#38:1:C>
I don't think the government is serious <,,> about giving <,>
control of this media <,> in the hands of independent people <,> uh though
government control still states <,> but state government is not willing to
<,> part ways with that kind of authority

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#39:1:B>
Well let us presume <,> that the idea is <,> to <,> go ahead
<,> with the <indig> Prasar Bharati </indig> Act

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#40:1:B>
Though <w> it's </w> been very slow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#41:1:B>
Uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#42:1:B>
Now as a former <,> Director General of <,> All India Radio or
Broadcasting <,> what would you say <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#43:1:D>
Well the first thing that government has to do <,> is to
invite legislation <,,> to set up its body <,> an independent body which is
going to assign frequently <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#44:1:D>
<w> It's </w> not the government that has it in a <,> in few
countries it is an independent body that does it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#45:1:D>
The next thing is to draw up <,,> the sort of priorities that you
want <,> of the <,> alternative programmes that <,> you think <}> <-> to </->
<+> of </+> </}> continuing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#46:1:D>
Yes it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#47:1:D>
If the only alternative that you can think of <,> is commercial <,>
then probably uh uhm <,,> there may be trouble <,> but I think <w> it's </w>
a mistake to suppose Madhu as you <,> as I think you were <,> making <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#48:1:D>
Mainly <,> that if uh <,> a private channel <,> comes or a
commercial channel <,> nobody will watch <indig> Doordarshan </indig> <,> <O>
one word </O> or listen to All India Radio <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#49:1:D>
Fact is that people thought that would happen to the B B C

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#50:1:D>
It didn't

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#51:1:D>
The B B C still does <,> mm control <,> a vast section of the
audience

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#52:1:D>
So <w> what's </w> the loss <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#53:1:D>
But they still do <,> and we are still setting the standard for <,>
for what ought to be <?> insat </?> doing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#54:1:D>
Now the question is <,> on what basis do we allot channels <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#55:1:B>
But the <,> the basic question is <,> <?> why </?> count and
change ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#56:1:B>
What do you want broadcasting to do <,> in terms of <,> what it is
now <,> and what it might be ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#57:1:B>
And what is the kind of change that you would <?> envy </?> <,> in
terms of the new <,> order <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#58:1:C>
Yes which we are thinking of uh <,> a second channel <,,>
again in the hands of the people <,> who are going to compete <,> uh who are
going to <,> attract more <,> listeners and viewers <,> on the basis of <,>
showing may be <,> some <,,> films or programmes which is is really in that
consumerism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#59:1:C>
Now my feeling is <indig> ke </indig> <,> the purpose is partly
lost <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#60:1:A>
Consumerism would be end of what <,> middle classes you say

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#61:1:C>
Yes definitely

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#62:1:C>
For example <,> <}> <-> the <.> ho </.> </-> <=> how </=> </}> do
we <,> ensure in this country <,> that uh <,,> this vast country <,> where
the people have certain <,,> other kind of ethos <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#63:1:C>
How do we appeal to them ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#64:1:C>
Because <,> if this second channel comes <,> and it is competitive
<,> as it should be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#65:1:C>
And if it is in the hands of some people <,> who can afford it <,>
then there aim would be <,> to <O> one word </O> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#66:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#67:1:C>
<w> They're </w> not very <,> who are going to be worried
about <,> uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#68:1:C>
I think they may need more than two channels <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#69:1:C>
Maybe third channel <,> or may be fourth channel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#70:1:C>
Some channel given to the university <,> some <}> <-> <.> ch </.>
</-> <=> channel </=> </}> given to the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#71:1:C>
Because <,> the purpose I have in view is <,> of course one view is
<,> of course <,> entertainment <,> <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#72:1:C>
But <,> other way I think is we must do something for <,> the
uplift of the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#73:1:C>
Use <,,> the <,> TV <,> use the <,> whatever this medium is <,> for
uh <,> fighting some prejudices <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#74:1:B>
Right

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#75:1:C>
Like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#76:1:B>
Well <w> let's </w> ask <,> Madhu here

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#77:1:A>
Well I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#78:1:B>
What kind of content would you <,> have if you were to have
<,> this opportunity <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#79:1:A>
I think uh <,> I disaggre with <}> <-> <.> Ku </.> </-> <=>
Kuldeep </=> </}> in that

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#80:1:A>
But I don't think there is a hard line <,> between uh <,> social
purpose <,> uplift of the people and entertainment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#81:1:A>
I think that had been the problem with <indig> Doordarshan </indig>
<,> that it catagorised so strictly that either <w> it's </w> cheap vulgar
entertainment <,> or it is <,> boring programmes for education which is so
boring that nobody in the right mind can watch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#82:1:A>
I think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger
of the two <,> an <?> infertainment </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#83:1:A>
And <}> <-> <.> up </.> </-> <=> uplift </=> </}> of people will
come from people who want to watch programmes <,> which is so interesting
that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are
being broken down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#84:1:A>
Things like that like uh <,> uh the tragedy that took place in
Sindhu recently where <,> lower caste people have been uh <,> butchered and
put in gunny bags <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#85:1:A>
I don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional
beautiful film was made <,> which made the higher caste people <,> aware of
the feelings

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#86:1:A>
And made the <,> the lower caste <?> mess </?> anonymous to them
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#87:1:A>
I think the large part of it is the anonimity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#88:1:A>
So I think that all this <,> I think that just making money making
revenues is looked down upon <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#89:1:A>
I don't think that so I think that making <}> <-> <.> re </.> </->
<=> revenue </=> </}> should be <,,> uh tied-up with the fact <,> that you
know that you can make money by doing things that will move people

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#90:1:B>
Right

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#91:1:B>
But we hear <,,> uh you are really talking about <,,> uh news <,>
and uh <,> daily affairs <,> current affairs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#92:1:B>
What about extention <,> education other things that are not really
marketable ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#93:1:B>
Where would the money come from <,> and what would it cost to put
up <,> such <,> a channel <,> such a network <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#94:1:B>
Because there is no scope in just of the metro <,> or the larger
cities <,> or the country as a whole

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#95:1:B>
And we talk of people <,> which are these people that we are
talking about ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#96:1:B>
Where do they live <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#97:1:B>
What is their level of understanding <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#98:1:B>
What language do they understand ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#99:1:B>
<}> <-> Is it </-> <=> is it </=> </}> English <,> or is it all our
fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal
languages <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#100:1:A>
Then don't you know that it is a major issue because <,> what
you are talking about the languages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#101:1:A>
If there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if <,>
they <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#102:1:B>
Again time and again we have dealt with this problem and <,>
<{> <[> uhm <,> and on radio <,> I think <w> you've </w> you have got to do
it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#103:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#104:1:B>
But you have also <+> to </+> be interested <,> in going
outside the framework <,> of All India Radio and <,> and <indig> Doordarshan
</indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#105:1:B>
How would you address this problem which people <,> what caste <,>
how do you <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#106:1:A>
You see uh a programme to uh <,,> not very well up and what
the cost would be on television but I know that there would be some thing
like ten times <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#107:1:A>
Uh atleast ten times if not for uh <,> for uh a <O> one word <O/>
worth in capital and then the exenditure

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#108:1:A>
But <,> take a small thing like <,> <O> one word </O> radio <,>
that is people are <,,> they are interested in each other <,> they have
common problem <,> they come and participate <,> they discuss their problem
<,> then they go ahead and <,> try to do something better <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#109:1:B>
Now uh I mean <,,> the question is <,> where does the money
come from <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#110:1:A>
Well <,> I think we really have to go out into the market to
see where the money is and where it comes from <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#111:1:A>
This opposition that people are not interested in uh <,,> a in
anything but making money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#112:1:A>
Uh I think <w> it's </w> a mistake <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#113:1:A>
There are any number of trust <,> <w> they're </w> running
hospitals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#114:1:A>
<w> They're </w> doing various other things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#115:1:A>
If the <?> said </?> uh uh <,> potential in radio and television
<,> <w> I'm </w> sure they will come forward

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#116:1:B>
Now you told us about <,> look up station video or radio <,>
even otherwise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#117:1:B>
<w> We're </w> talking about <,> four five six <indig> crores
</indig> <,> not more than that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#118:1:B>
But you know <w> I'm </w> talking of national hook-ups <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#119:1:B>
When <w> we're </w> talking of hundreds of <indig> crores </indig>
<,,> Kuldeep where do you think uh <,> uh <,> our options lie <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#120:1:B>
Because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense
<w> we've </w> national broadcasting then regional broadcasting <,> local
broadcasting in the sense is yet to come

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#121:1:C>
The communities <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#122:1:B>
Now <,> if you think of starting from the bottom then it
becomes managable

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#123:1:B>
As <,> you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or
university <,> people want to spend that

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#124:1:B>
Because the <?> career teaching </?> is that it needs it <,> and
<w> it's </w> useful <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#125:1:B>
Our teacher talking about current affairs <,> <}> <-> <.> talk
</.> </-> <=> talking </=> </}> about <,> you know since it is a very high
level <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#126:1:B>
Then one is really talking about <,> films that may be a of <,> of
<,> of uh interest <,> to high <?> guard </?> people <,> to well educated
people <,> and to very weak <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#127:1:B>
Otherwise <w> we're </w> talking to farmers <,> simple people in
their language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#128:1:B>
How would they manage this ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#129:1:B>
This is the question <w> I'll </w> ask to <,> ask to Kuldeep and
Madhu you also

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#130:1:B>
Because this is really <,> were the <?> boiling </?> butter comes
in <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#131:1:C>
I think the idea of a local station <,> is a very good idea

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#132:1:C>
I think <w> it's </w> been tried abroad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#133:1:C>
Uh and uh <,> I think while Madhu was commenting on my <,,> uh <?>
vocation </?> that I <O> one word </O> counter view I <O> one word </O> <,> I
think Mr Madhu was missing <,> one <,> side of it <,> and that is what I want
to answer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#134:1:C>
And it is <,> take for example <,> the <mention> Mandal Commission
</mention> <,> report <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#135:1:C>
How many people really explained <,,> what it meant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#136:1:C>
Of course <,,> our TV picked up the stories that little boys were
killed <,> the boys were that

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#137:1:C>
But <,> this look here <,> this is wrong with the Hindu society
<,> that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being
for thousands of years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#138:1:C>
Maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#139:1:C>
But was it <?> exploited </?> if these now stations are there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#140:1:C>
Maybe these were like <,> small kinds of uh <,> outlets <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#141:1:C>
Maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing
because these are the people from below <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#142:1:C>
These are the people at the grass roots <,> and help them to
overcome their prejudices

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#143:1:B>
Kuldeep I wanted to button there if I may

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#144:1:B>
And also doing <O> one or two words </O> what Madhu was speaking
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#145:1:B>
In a programme of that kind what is happening to people in
different parts of India <,> I think uh <,,> the important thing is <,> not
that you tell people who know about themselves

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#146:1:B>
But you tell others <,> in different parts of the country that
look <,,> this is how people are living in a certain part

The network would be important

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#148:1:B>
And I think <,> uh Madhu where I very much agree with you <,>
there is enormous interest of people <,> in other people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#149:1:B>
We know <,> next to nothing but so many <,,> extremely interesting
groups in our country <,> and I think <,> television could <,> and radio
could <,> help the broadcast

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#150:1:A>
But can we do that ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#151:1:C>
Unless there is some kind of a right <,> unless there is some
kind of break up <,> unless there is some vague <O> one word </O> nothing
alse can work

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#152:1:B>
<{> <[> In that way </[> Kuldeep <,> is one thing that nobody
can disagree with the regional station

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#153:1:B>
I think that is the way that <,> that India should go

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#154:1:B>
Because with that many languages <,> I think <w> it'll </w> be
crucial if we give <,> uh local stations atleast a certain amount of <,>
hours before the <,> before the national hook-up <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#155:1:A>
<[> <O> One or to words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-025#156:1:B>
I think <w> we're </w> talking about explaining to people
about why something like <mention> Mandal </mention> took place

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#157:1:B>
About the vote bank <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#158:1:B>
I think <w> that's </w> their patronising <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#159:1:B>
I think that I don't think we have to explain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#160:1:B>
I think what we have to do is to bring <,> whatever is happening
<,> to them and deal and <,> and show that this is not <,> this a channel <,>
this is a person <,> this is human being <,> this is <w> what's </w>
happening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#161:1:B>
And I think <,> I trust <,> our people <O> one word </O> Indians
<,> wherever we live in India <,> that they will <,> respond <,> that they
will feel <,> that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the
woman that had been raped <,> this is the man that has <,> suffered injustice
<,> and I think people will really respond when we <,> when we remove <,> the
anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the
distances <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#162:1:B>
Which is something that our electronic media has done

<ICE-IND:S1B-025#163:1:B>
And when we see <,> constantly you see on programmes <,> people
are fake <,> they are artificial <,> nobody talks like that <,> they normally
do in their life <,> even the language is <,> is not colloquial <,> </I>
