<ICE-IND:S2A-061#1:1:A>
May it please Your Honour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#2:1:A>
Now <,> this is a case <,,> in which originally there were five  
accused persons <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#3:1:A>
There were five accused persons <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#4:1:A>
And the police was able to <,,> get the presence of only three  
persons they could arrest three persons <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#5:1:A>
So we have started with the case <,,> against these three accused  
<,,> two have clarified right from beginning <,> <&> interruption </&> they  
are not there <,> no one of them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#6:1:A>
Thereafter <,,> Your Honour was pleased to frame a charge against  
them <,,> on two accounts <,,> the charges <,> execute them <,,> <&>  
interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#7:1:A>
Against three persons <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#8:1:A>
Three accounts <,,> <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#9:1:A>
Which is that charge number sir <,,> ? <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#10:1:A>
That is there <,> that <w> I'll I'll </w> I will be giving up that  
charge Sir <,,> thirty seventh <,,> read is Bombay Police Act <,,> for that  
purpose I have not laid the evidence sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#11:1:A>
Because in order to prove the charge under Bombay Police Act <,,>  
it is necessary for the prosecution to show <,,> that the <?> promolgation  
</?> order <,,> was <,,> duly exhibited <,,> and it was promulgated <,,> in  
various parts <,,> and not only that but there was it was specially also  
there <&> interruption </&> yes yes the Bandra police station <,> then I have  
to examine the constable <,,> I have to examine the police officer <,> I have  
to produce the diary entries <,,> showing all those things <,> which has not  
been done in this particular case <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#12:1:A>
Therefore as it has <}> <-> <.> cou </.> </-> <=> code </=> </}>  
number three <O> two words </O> Your Honour can take it <,> that the  
prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#13:1:A>
Therefore now the first charge is <,,> that your accused number one  
two three <,,> along with absconding accused <,> <@> Motu </@> <,,> <@> Mota  
Umesh </@> <,> and <@> Kadam </@> <,,> on or about the third day of April  
nineteen <,,> eighty-eight <,,> at about eleven ten hours <,,> in presence of  
the common intention <,,> at open place <,,> near Harbour railway line <,,>  
<}> <-> <.> shun </.> </-> <=> shunting </=> </}> track Pragati nagar <,,>  
Matunga <,> Dharavi Bombay at nine <,,> committed murder by intentionally  
<,,> and all knowingly causing the death of <@> Iyengar </@> <,,> <@>  
Silkrumal Pandu </@> <,> and thereby committed an offence punishable under  
section three naught two <,,> read with section thirty-four of the Indian  
Penal Code <,> and within the cognizance of this court <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#14:1:A>
Now second this is one charge of murder <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#15:1:A>
Murder in respect of <@> Iyengar </@> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#16:1:A>
Second charge is <,,> under section three nought seven Sir <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#17:1:A>
That charge is <,,> that you accused number one two three <,,>  
along with the <,,> absconding accused <@> Umesh </@> and <@> Kadam </@> <,,>  
on about third April on the same day <,,> at about eleven thirty-five <,,> in  
presence of common intention did an act <,,> of <,,> causing <,,> with  
<indig> Rampuri </indig> knife and <indig> koyta </indig> <,,> causing heart  
attack near Government Milk booth <,,> opposite <,,> Madrasis <,,> Masjid Dr  
Ambedkar road <,,> Matunga Bombay <,,> with such intent <&> interruption </&>  
ahn <,,> with such intention <,,> and under such circumstances that if by  
that act <,,> you had caused the death of <@> Kadu </@> <,> <@> Hosappa  
Achari </@> <,> <@> Kadu Hosappa Achari </@> <,,> you would have been guilty  
of murder <,,> but the <@> Kadu </@> he is survived <,> and therefore <,,>  
and that <,> you caused the hurt to the <O> two words </O> and thereby  
committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the  
Indian Penal Code <,> with read with section thirty-four of the Indian Penal  
code <,,> and within the cognizance of Your Honours court Sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#18:1:A>
Now therefore there are two charges <,,> one charge <&>  
interruption </&> yes <&> interruption </&> because I have not laid any <&>  
interruption </&> in entire view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#19:1:A>
No evidence has been laid <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#20:1:A>
Therefore as we got third cause <,> Prosecution itself is <,,> that  
they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there <,,> on  
the third charge Sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#21:1:A>
Now Your Honour <,,> as far as the background of this case is  
concerned <,,> actual <,,> <&> interruption </&> actually we started  
recording the evidence <,,> on fourteenth October ninety-two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#22:1:A>
Prior to that this case <,> went from various courts to various  
courts <,> and thereafter ultimately it came to this court Sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#23:1:A>
Till then the accused <?> prevent </?> at the Trial Court <,> from  
commencing the trial Sir <,,> <&> interruption </&> did not allowed <&>  
interruption </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#24:1:A>
They made all efforts to see that the accused <,,> that the  
advocates are made to run away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#25:1:A>
They would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want  
that advocates <,,> and ultimately <,,> even the court also cancelled those  
prosecutors <,> they made allegations against the court also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#26:1:A>
All types of allegations were made <,> and subsequently the case  
has come to this court <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#27:1:A>
Moment the case came to our court <,,> we <,> we immediately framed  
the charge <,,> and started with an assertion <,> proceeded from day to day  
<,,> right upto <,,> eighteen December <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#28:1:A>
On eighteen December ninety-two I closed my case <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#29:1:A>
Thereafter it was expected <,,> that immediately Your Honour will  
<,> take upto thirtieth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#30:1:A>
That Your Honour has done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#31:1:A>
And after <O> two words </O> <,> judgement of the accused <,,> it  
was expected that I should start with the argument <,,> and the defence  
should do <,> immediately <,,> commence with their arguments <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#32:1:A>
Unfortunately Mr Seth <,,> the Defence Advocate <,> on behalf of  
number two and three went out of Bombay <,,> making a promise to this court  
<,> that <,,> he is going to <,> give a written argument <,,> or if he is not  
<,> then he will come and argue himself <,,> and at the most it will take  
another two or three months so Your Honour was to give then didn't <&>  
interruption </&> by March <,> <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#33:1:A>
And he said that <,,> but he promised that even <,> prior to that  
<,,> he would send the written argument <,,> so the <&> interruption </&>  
<indig> haan </indig> they have got this to say <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#34:1:A>
But nothing of this kind <,> kind was done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#35:1:A>
<w> It's </w> only about couple of weeks that <,,> only two or  
three weeks back <,,> that he happened to be here in Bombay <,> and that is  
how we have fixed up this particular date for <?> argue </?> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#36:1:A>
Therefore lot of delay has been caused <,,> in recording the  
evidence <,> and the arguments <,,> because we started with the <,,>  
recording of the evidence on fourteenth October <,> and on now on fifteenth  
September <w> I'm </w> arguing the matter <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#37:1:A>
Therefore <w> I'm </w> sorry that I will have to take Your Honour  
through the evidence of each witness <,> because nobody is expected <,> it is  
not expected the court to remember <,> what <,> evidence was laid <,> one  
year back <,> practically one year back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#38:1:A>
So I will have to go through each and every <,> witness <,,> read  
the evidence and thus start commenting on it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#39:1:A>
So I will start with the first witness P W one Sir <,,> <&>  
interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#40:1:A>
In all <,,> in all in this particular case are examine <,>  
twenty-four Prosecution <&> interruption </&> witnesses <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#41:1:A>
To divide this into <,,> two separate compartments <,> because some  
of the witnesses will be in respect of murder <,,> some will be in respect of  
the second charge <&> interruption </&> and some witnesses will be common  
witnesses <,,> namely <,> when both <,> both the accused both the <,> persons  
were taken to hospital <,> the same constable there he made diary entries  
etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#42:1:A>
So there would be some common witnesses Sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#43:1:A>
Then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common  
witnesses will be there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#44:1:A>
So now <w> we'll I'll </w> start reading <,> P W one Sir <,> so  
that will give the list of F I R <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#45:1:A>
If Your Honour wants this facts <w> I'll </w> give the this facts  
Sir <,> <&> interruption </&> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#46:1:A>
Now this has not been done in chronological order <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#47:1:A>
We have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#48:1:A>
Therefore some witnesses are pertaining to <,,> first charge  
immediately some pertaining to second charge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#49:1:A>
So whichever witness was available <,,> those witnesses were  
brought by the officers <,,> because <,,> the accused <,> as I have said <,>  
in the beginning when I open up the case <,,> I said <,> that these accused  
are notorious type kind <,,> of notorious character <,> bad character <,>  
accused <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#50:1:A>
And witnesses were afraid of coming <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#51:1:A>
So the police officer Mr Ansari <,,> and other officers they had to  
take lot of pains <,,> to go and collect them <,,> search them <,> and then  
get them here in the court <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#52:1:A>
So it <,> which ever is available <,> I started examining <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#53:1:A>
So normally otherwise what happens <,> normally our <,,> practice  
is <,,> <}> <-> <.> a a </.> </-> <=> all </=> </}> prosecutors <,> that <,>  
when we find that there is charge of murder <,> then we start examining all  
the witnesses regarding <,> that particular charge in a chronological order  
<,> then three nought seven <,> same order <,> and then some common things  
<,> Doctors etcetera they are all common thing which are there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#54:1:A>
But in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not  
possible <,> because victims were afraid <,> they were running away <,,> and  
the officer has to go <,,> get them <,,> locate them <,> and then <,> they  
were brought here <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#55:1:A>
Yes because they were afraid <,,> running away means <,> they were  
they made themslves <,> scared to the police officer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#56:1:A>
The moment they <,,> found that some officer from Dharavi police  
station <&> interruption </&> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#57:1:A>
The people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution <,>  
two accused are <,> were abscounding <,,> and they are still abscounding <,,>  
and and those <,> <}> <-> <.> accu </.> </-> <=> accused </=> </}> persons  
has a gang <,> and this gang was moving in that area <,> with the use of this  
<.> tho </.> constant fear in the minds of witnesses <,,> that these two  
other persons may <,,> not directly but through some other persons <,> may  
attack them and therefore they were not willing to come <,> <&> interruption  
</&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#58:1:A>
These <&> interruption </&> of course <,,> this gang consisted of  
this main five persons <,,> out of which two are now <}> <-> <.> ab ab </.>  
</-> <=> absconding </=> </}> <&> interruption </&> ah yes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#59:1:A>
And apart from those <,> those two persons again formed another  
gang because these three persons were not there <,> they formed another gang  
<,,> but then they were not directly coming in Dharavi <,> area <,> they were  
sending those persons in Dharavi area because they knew <,,> the moment they  
come to Dharavi area <,,> these officers from Dharavi Police Station Ansari  
<,,> and other other Jadhav <,> they will definitely arrest them <,> because  
they would arrest them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#60:1:A>
Therefore they would not come personally <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#61:1:A>
They would send their other <indig> gundas </indig> there in that  
locality <,> to settle everything <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#62:1:A>
And therefore this is the <,,> this therefore <,> when I read the  
evidence some of the witnesses will be <,> for first account <,> some of the  
witnesses of second account <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#63:1:A>
So I will then up <,> subsequently <,> while <,> concluding the  
argument <O> cough </O> I will see that <,> all those witnesses are I will  
<,> some arrange <,> and then I will say that <,> I will point out <,> the  
exact <&> interruption </&> <indig> haan </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#64:1:A>
Then I will say therefore in this case <,,> this is the scene  
regarding this this witness is regarding this <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#65:1:A>
That we can register afterwards <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#66:1:A>
So therefore I will now start with the P W one <,,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#67:1:A>
Now <,,> the important point in this particular case is <,,> that  
this incident that taken place on the on the <,,> on Sunday <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#68:1:A>
It was on Sunday <,,> third October <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#69:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sorry third April sir <,,> was Sunday <,> <&>  
interruption </&> no third sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#70:1:A>
It was third April <,,> nineteen eighty-eight <,,> <&> interruption  
</&> <indig> haan </indig> <,,> nineteen eighty-eight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#71:1:A>
It was Sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#72:1:A>
Eleven ten or so <,,> morning time <,> <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#73:1:A>
At an open place <,,> near Harbour railway line <,,> shunting track  
<,,> that was the <&> interruption </&> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#74:1:A>
So I am I am talking about the first offence of murder <&>  
interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#75:1:A>
So now was of <,> the <&> interruption </&> Masjid Masjid <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#76:1:A>
So now what I am giving is the first <,,> offence of murder took  
place first <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#77:1:A>
So therefore I am giving this place <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#78:1:A>
At open place <,,> near <,> Harbour railway line <,,> <&>  
interruption </&> Matunga <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#79:1:A>
Harbour railway line <,,> shunting track <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#80:1:A>
This track which was not operated <,> except for shunting purposes  
<,,> Pragati Nagar <,,> hutment at Matunga Sir <,,> <O> One word </O> <,,>  
but <,,> <&> interruption </&> Dharavi sir <&> interruption </&> no it comes  
in Dharavi sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#81:1:A>
And now as it has <,> this is the incident regarding murder <,,> of  
<@> Iyengar </@> <,,> and now <w> I'm </w> giving the timing of the <,,>  
other persons <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#82:1:A>
That is uh <}> <-> <@> Kaju </@> </-> <,> <=> <@> Kadu </@> </=>  
</}> <@> Hosappa Achari </@> <,,> regarding three naught seven <,,> there the  
timing is about eleven thirty <&> interruption </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#83:1:A>
No because <,> we have started with the <.> evid </.> I am why I am  
<}> <-> <.> tak </.> </-> <=> talking </=> </}> about this <,> because the P  
W one is <@> Kadu Achari </@> <,,> when I read the evidence <,> <w> I'll </w>  
be reading the <,> the evidence of <@> Kadu Achari </@> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#84:1:A>
Therefore <w> I'm </w> giving the timing Sir <,,>

And this took place <,> at about eleven thirty sir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#88:1:A>
Now <,> there is a connection between this murder and that murder  
in the sense <,,> that <,,> <@> Iyengar </@> happened to be the <,,>  
brother-in-law of <@> Achari </@> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-061#89:1:A>
