<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#3:1>
PRIME minster V.P. Singh today declared he would not use Indian
Air Force planes or helicopters for electioneering during the coming Assembly
polls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#4:1>
Talking to newsman on his return journey from his parliamentary
constituency Fatehpur, he said he would not use any official machinery for
the electioneering and hoped other chief ministers would also set such an
example. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#5:1>
Replying to questions, he said he would not use State Government
aircraft or helicopters for election purpose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#6:1>
Mr. Singh, however, clarified that he would use the IAF services
to reach Delhi for <quote> " official purpose only." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#7:1>
Otherwise he would use the Indian Airlines services for tour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#8:1>
The Prime Minster said he wants to bring about real democratic
norms in electioneering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#9:1>
<bold> Asked about seat adjustments for the ensuing Assembly
polls, Mr. Singh said the National Front would strive for <quote> "
one-to-one" </quote> contests.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#10:1>
Although there could be differences at local levels, there was
<quote> " great willingness" </quote> for such adjustments, he said.
</bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#11:1>
According to him, the <quote> " one-to-one" </quote> adjustment
was the best in most constituencies to ensure the complete defeat of the
Congress(I). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#12:1>
On the question of army deserters, after <quote> " Operation
Bluestar" </quote> in Punjab, Mr. Singh, who also holds the defence
portfolio, said there were only about 24 of them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#13:1>
Since they could not be taken back into the army he had asked the
State Government to provide them other jobs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#14:1>
<bold> Replying to other questions, the Prime Minister said since
most of the appointments of governors were <quote> " purely political"
</quote> , the Government would consider shifting them <quote> " based on
reports about their activities." </quote> </bold> </p>

elections are over.

<quote> " We will get an overall picture only after that" </quote> ,
Mr. Singh said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#20:1>
However, he did not rule out inducting a <quote> " small number of
ministers" </quote> to his Council before that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#21:1>
Addressing a meeting in his Fatehpur <indig> Lok Sabha </indig>
constituency, Mr. Singh said the Government would go ahead with its decision
to give autonomy to the electronic media to strengthen democracy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#22:1>
He said the Government would give special attention to the
development of Bundelkhand and hill regions to remove regional
imbalances in the State. </p> </I>

<h> Grain dealers to reject entry tax </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#30:3>
<bold> By A <@AS> Staff Reporter {#} </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#31:3>
<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> Jan. 5 {#} :
The Bombay Grain <w> Dealers' </w> Association has, for the first time,
come out publicly against the proposed <quote> " entry tax" </quote> system
in lieu of octroi and resigned from the Indian <w> Merchants' </w> Chamber
( IMC) following differences with other members of the Chamber. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#32:3>
The Association, with about 5000 members in the city, maintained
that entry tax would cause untold hardships to small shopkeepers and stated
that compared to octroi, entry tax is the greater evil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#33:3>
At a press conference today, soon after submitting their
resignation from the IMC, the <w> Association's </w> president Popatlal Shah
and other office-bearers, reiterated that their opposition to the Kasbeker
Committee recommendations for replacement of octroi with entry tax was
well-documented. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#34:3>
The Indian Merchants Chamber has failed to grasp the situation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#35:3>
It is seeking to pass the buck to the retailers who in turn, will
pass it on to the consumer, Mr. Shah said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#36:3>
Admitting that octroi does give revenue to urban local bodies, the
Association said <quote> " we are not here to justify or criticize octroi"
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#37:3>
The <w> Association's </w> stand promises to further queer the
pitch in the raging controversy over the octroi abolition/retention debate.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#38:3>
As it is, traders have threatened to agitate from January 9 even as
civic <w> employees' </w> unions have sworn to launch a counter-agitation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#39:3>
Mr. Shah said that the immediate provocation for the <w>
Association's </w> public position on the issue came after the news of the
January 9 agitation by traders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#40:3>
According to the Association, all shopkeepers, however small
their trade, must file their returns, maintain separate accounts for local
goods produced by another registered or unregistered dealer in the same area,
take on the job of maintenance of records etc.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#41:3>
The entry tax may also spawn corruption with visits from inspectors
and maintenance of books of accounts, they fear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#42:3>
The Association, which disclaims any connection with the <quote> "
Save octroi committee" </quote> of civic employees unions and mayors of
local bodies, plans to contact associations of grain dealers in other parts
of the State to press for their demand against entry tax.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#43:3>
The Association does not, at present, have any alternative to either
octroi or entry tax, a spokesperson said. </p> </I>

<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> January 6 {#} :
The additional commerce secretary, Mr V.S. Venkatraman, has called
for increasing the <w> country's </w> share in the world jewellery trade
to five per cent from about one per cent at present as India exported gold
jewellery worth Rs 165 <indig> crore </indig> during 1988-89. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#59:7>
Inaugurating the five-day Jewel <indig> Yatra </indig> 90, fifth
in the series, organised by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council
here on Saturday, Mr Venkatraman said the <indig> yatra </indig> had led to a
growth of 115 per cent in the past two years in cut and polished diamonds
exports. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#60:7>
He said diamond exports during 1988-89 at Rs 4230 <indig> crore
</indig> registered 73 per cent increase over Rs 2440 <indig> crore </indig>
of 1987-88, which was 40 per cent more than Rs 1960 <indig> crore </indig> of
1986-87. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#61:7>
Mr Kaushik M. Mehta, council chairman, said exemption of sales
tax on loose diamonds would have far reaching results on the export trade.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#62:7>
The <w> council's </w> request for exempting coloured gem stones and
pearls from sales tax in jewellery as well as loose form was still pending

<h> Control pollution of Delhi, urges Maneka </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#66:8>
<@PR> NEW DELHI {#},
<@DR> Dec. 31 {#} ( <@SR> UNI {#}):
The Union minister of state for environment and forests, Ms Maneka
Gandhi, has urged the Delhi administration to take immediate measures to
arrest the growing air pollution in the capital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#67:8>
Expressing serious concern in a letter to the lieutenant governor
of Delhi, the minister said Delhi had acquired the dubious distinction of
being one of the most polluted cities in the world in terms of ambient air
quality and automobile exhaust. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#68:8>
According to an official release, the minister has asked the
administration to effectively enforce the emission standards for
automobiles which will come into force on an all-India level from March 1.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#69:8>
The minister also suggested an awareness programme for the
road-using public to be undertaken to help prevent pollution.

<ICE-IND:W2C-001#70:8>
She felt that a circular railway system in Delhi with proper
integration with the Delhi Transport Corporation and private routes could be
explored as a medium-term solution to ease overloading problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-001#71:8>
The minister also emphasised the need to replace the exceedingly
large number of obsolete buses and to ensure enough supply of <}> <->
effecient </-> <+> efficient </+> </}> fuel injection systems and piston
rings to prevent excessive emission of smoke and other pollutants. </p> </I>
