<ICE-IND:S2A-051#1:1:A>
Indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty
<,> and spicy <,> meaning chilli hot <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#2:1:A>
Nothing should be farther from the truth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#3:1:A>
It is unfortunate that the excessive use of <,> <indig> desi ghee
</indig> which is clarified butter <,> or vegetable shortening and spices <,>
by a handful of half baked cook <,> made as a misunderstood food <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#4:1:A>
Our food is rich <,> but not fatty <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#5:1:A>
It is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than
necessary <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#6:1:A>
But the amazing thing about Indian cuisine is that the cooking is
deemed complete <,> when the fat leaves the sides or comes on the surface <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#7:1:A>
In other words <,> the ingredients <,> expose all fat <,> when fully
cooked <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#8:1:A>
The excess fat merely uses the cooking process <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#9:1:A>
In any event <,> it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is
served <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#10:1:A>
In fact the drained fat <,> which we call <indig> rogan </indig>
<,> can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma
of spices <,> acquired during the cooking of the dish <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#11:1:A>
Of course <,> the <indig> rogan </indig> cannot be used again and
again <,> but just once again <,> which is not to say that this series <,> is
even for one solitary moment <,> recommending that to use a gram or a
mililitre of extra fat <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#12:1:A>
The same applies for that nasty word <mention> spicy </mention>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#13:1:A>
The fact is <,> our food is spicy <,> not chilli hot <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#14:1:A>
We make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and
aroma <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#15:1:A>
The use of red chilli <,> on the other hand <,> is at <w> one's
</w> own discreation <,> like to burn yourself <,> do so <,> don't want to
<,> don't burn others as well <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#16:1:A>
There are however <,> some regions which <,,> are using more red
chillies than the others <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#17:1:A>
They are the exceptions rather than the rule <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#18:1:A>
Having said that <,> this episode is guarantee to give lovers of
hot food <,> a vicarious thrill <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#19:1:A>
Those with feeble guts <,> I advice to stay away from <w> today's
</w> fiery delight <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#20:1:A>
Hey Manjit <,> <w> what's </w> this pungent nose testing aroma ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#21:1:A>
What you are smelling is <,> red chillies <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#22:1:A>
And <,> believe it or not <,> we are going to use <,> sixty-four
red chillies <,,> with two and a quarter pound of meat <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#23:1:A>
He is going to make us the spice chop called <indig> lal maas
</indig> <,,> translated <,> that means red meat <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#24:1:A>
One of the kinds you and I know about <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#25:1:A>
The red here refers to this <,> red chillies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#26:1:A>
And he is going to use sixty of them <,> mind boggling figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#27:1:A>
Of course <,> this is arguably <,,> the hottest dish in the land
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#28:1:A>
As you can see <,> this guy is just about ready to burn my in all
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#29:1:A>
You if you have <,,> steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy
for you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#30:1:A>
Whatever my fears about red chillies <,> <w> I've </w> got a health
mandate and get into my dig <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#31:1:B>
Welcome to this Dawat <,,> the first dish in <w> today's </w>
menu is <indig> lal maas </indig> or red meat <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#32:1:B>
Pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#33:1:B>
A dish guaranteed to wake up your insights <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#34:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> begin with a list of ingredients <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#35:1:B>
Two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb <,> deboned and cut it
into one and a half inch cubes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#36:1:B>
Sixty red chillies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#37:1:B>
One and a quarter cups <,> finely sliced onions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#38:1:B>
One third cup <,> peeled and sliced garlic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#39:1:B>
One cup <,> yoghurt <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#40:1:B>
One teaspoon <,,> roasted cumin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#41:1:B>
Four teaspoons <,> corriander powder <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#42:1:B>
Half a teaspoon turmeric powder <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#43:1:B>
Five tablespoons refined oil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#44:1:B>
The preparation time for this dish is one hour <,,> and the cooking
time is fifty minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#45:1:B>
With accompaniments <,> this dish serves approximately four people
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#46:1:B>
The method <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#47:1:B>
Remove stems from the red chillies <,,> slit them <,,> beseed and
soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water <,> for fifteen minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#48:1:B>
Before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used <,>
here is a reassuring word about red chillies <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#49:1:A>
While Manjeet prepares the other ingredients <,,> let me clear
some cobwebs about red chillies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#50:1:A>
For a long time <,> especially outside this country <,> the word
spicy has been synonymous with chillies <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#51:1:A>
To us Indians <,> the word spicy means a combination of exotic
spices <,> of which chilli is just one measly part <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#52:1:A>
Eaten in the right quantity <,> and the prescribed limit is one
teaspoon <,> or two or three whole red chillies per person per day <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#53:1:A>
Chillies are said to prevent cold <,> cold sweats induced by
tension <,> and cholera <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#54:1:A>
Now in the last thing <,> it is important <,> to consume a little
bit of chilli during the monsoon <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#55:1:B>
Proceeding with the preparation <,> whisk one cup of yoghurt
in a bowl <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#56:1:B>
Add the red chillies <,,> shake a dry girdle and add one
teaspoonful of cumin seeds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#57:1:B>
Roast lightly <,,> <&> noise of roasting </&> until the cumin pops
and emits a unique aroma <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#58:1:B>
Now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture <,,> <&> noise of
stirring </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#59:1:B>
Add four teaspoons of corriander powder <,,> half teaspoon turmeric
powder <,,> and stir in salt to taste <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#60:1:B>
Whisk <,> and set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#61:1:B>
Some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the
garlic and yoghurt in this recipe <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#62:1:B>
Without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those
red hot chillies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#63:1:B>
And now for the cooking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#64:1:B>
Heat five tablespoons of refined oil <,,> add the sliced garlic and
set over a medium heat until golden <,,> <&> noise of stirring </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#65:1:B>
Add the onions and stir again until golden brown <,,> <&> nise of
stirring </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#66:1:B>
Finally <,> add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave
the sides of the pan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#67:1:B>
This process is also called pruno <,> and takes approximately five
to six minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#68:1:B>
Now add the chilli yoghurt mixture <,> and stir fry until the
moisture evaporates <,,> <&> noise of stirring </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#69:1:B>
To complete the cooking <,> add three and one third cups of water
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#70:1:B>
Bring to a boil <,,> cover and simmer <,,> stir occasionally until
the meat is cooked <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#71:1:B>
To check if the meat is done <,> take out a piece <,> and break it
apart <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#72:1:B>
The gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#73:1:B>
Check the salt <,> and the fiery red meat is done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#74:1:B>
But this is best eaten with the steamed rice or <indig> chapati
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#75:1:B>
Arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter <,,> and spoon on
the sizzling <indig> lal maas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#76:1:B>
The second dish on our menu today is Pepper Chicken or <indig> mori
curry </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#77:1:B>
Chicken with a totally unique flavour <,> salty chicken taste buds
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#78:1:A>
Pepper chicken is from the Chickena district in Tamil Nad <,>
which is home to the trading community of Chickenna <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#79:1:A>
They however call it <indig> murgakoli chickenna </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#80:1:A>
In it they use an inordinately large quantity of coarsely ground
black pepper powder <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#81:1:A>
I can see Manjeet is getting a bit little impatient <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#82:1:A>
And <w> I'll </w> tell you a little bit more about the pepper <,>
later in this programme <,,>

<$B>

This will take approximately ten to twelve minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#109:1:B>
While we wait for the chicken to cook <,> a brief word about black
pepper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#110:1:A>
Talking about <?> chetinad </?> it is inevitable that I
should tell you about pepper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#111:1:A>
Foremost <,> pepper is said to cure and prevent asthma <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#112:1:A>
Taken with honey <,> it is said to give relief in heavy cold <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#113:1:A>
It is good for the heart <,> and is said to ease stomach aches <,>
and cure piles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#114:1:A>
Sprinkled on fruits <,> or other foods along with salt <,> sea or
rock it is supposed to make for an excellent digestive <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#115:1:B>
To serve make a bed of the gravy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#116:1:B>
Arrange pieces of chicken <,,> and garnish with fresh corriander
<,,> and more fresh ground pepper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#117:1:B>
In fact celebrity panel does not feel rich tonight with the
<indig> lal maas </indig> <,> black will definitely be the other colour
scheme <&> Interuption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#118:1:B>
Let us proceed to the dining table <,> while our guest try out
this <?> coveted </?> dishes <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#119:1:C>
You know what we are eating is <,> <indig> murgakoli </indig>
chikenna <,> when translated what that means is Pepper Chicken <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#120:1:C>
I thought they ate really spicy food <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#121:1:D>
Uh it is spicy but it is slightly <,> fried <,> means a
little oil to go head off

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#122:1:D>
You know he makes the second dish for that <O> laughs </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#123:1:E>
Fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are
these ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#124:1:C>
Yeah this chicken we have used the uh <,> thigh of the
chicken <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#125:1:C>
So that you have the consistency <,> uh is there in the base <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#126:1:C>
I thought it is the same and <,> that every <,> every person gets
the same part that is important

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#127:1:E>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#128:1:C>
Actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are
talking about now <,> is <?> dinapsychology </?>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#129:1:C>
Uh <,> and the objective here is to make sure that <,> everybody
is <,,> cut off meat or <,> the the shape of the vegetable is identical so
that <,> when you peep into somebody <w> else's </w> plate you don't have
this terrible sense of envy as if you know <,> uh <,> say Arti has the better
piece and Romi hasn't got the one that she like <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#130:1:C>
So we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by
providing an identical cut <,> all are being identical size of vegetables
<,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#131:1:E>
But this what about <O> one word </O> may be a particular
guest would prefer to have another piece

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#132:1:C>
Romi <w> it's </w> not as if we sort of you know done this at
random

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#133:1:C>
But we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery <,> uh
<,,> in Indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really
can't <,> uh provide any good uh delicacies

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#134:1:C>
So we consulted our butcher and <,> as per his advice decided for
example the case of the <indig> murgakoli </indig> chickenna but the ideal
stuff would be <,> the thigh <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#135:1:C>
May be Manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#136:1:D>
Yes its your own choice also <,> and uh <,> whether it may be
that must need one <?> dine </?> <,> whether you use <?> dine </?> from the
thigh or the <O> one word </O>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#137:1:E>
I see that means originally <,> from the chickenna if they
have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#138:1:D>
Well this uh <,> they feel that one <O> one word </O> of the
meat should to be used in a particular curry <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#139:1:D>
Originally <,> <w> I've </w> got some chicken of it used <,> <w>
that's </w> to as a matter of fact if I may say I am looking a bit

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#140:1:D>
You know in the South <,> in considering the <O> one word </O> as
a major Brahminical influence

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#141:1:C>
And consequently you will uh <,> notice that when you go down
south that <,> uh the pieces of meat are usually cut into very small <,>
sizes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-051#142:1:C>
And they are really nugget size pieces <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#143:1:D>
But they originally do it for snacks you they will know only
use of this size

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-051#144:1:C>
Normally it can be looked this size <,,> </I>
