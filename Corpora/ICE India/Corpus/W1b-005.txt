Dear Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#4:1>
I recall you had mentioned that you were likely to
leave the  
country for a conference - - I hope my telegram reached you on
time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#5:1>
In fact I had sent a consent telegram in response to
your request  
earlier on 20. 4. 90. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#6:1>
This one got delayed as I was in Delhi. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#7:1>
I would need a formal invitation from you for
collaboration with  
specific reference to the project & that it would not involve
financial  
liabilities for the University. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#8:1>
Once I have that letter from you I shall write back,
but I have to  
route it through Head, Dean & Registrar, so that I keep them
informed right  
from the start. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#9:1>
I can start that process on receiving a letter from
you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#10:1>
Unfortunately our MA Part I exams have been
postponed &  
rescheduled for first week of July. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#11:1>
Our experience has been that external examiners tend
to be too  
liberal in assessment & I would caution you against that. </p>

 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#12:1>
The next few weeks are full of anxiety - - till
Deb gets  
admission & settles in well. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#13:1>
Our teaching materials for Commerce are ready but
due to  
formalities of permission for publication, are yet to go into
print. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#14:1>
We have been approached by Macmillan & by Oxford. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#15:1>
Due to the delay - - The Shivaji book continues for
another year. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#16:1>
Do you advise that we write to the publishers ? </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#17:1>
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#24:1>
I was rather shocked to receive your letter and to
know of the  
deep agony that you & your family must have gone through
during the last few  
months. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#25:1>
The fact that you mention that it took you an hour to
write a page  
speaks of the depth of your distress - - but it also speaks of
the depth of  
affection we have managed to retain since 1977. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#26:1>
It is a great blessing that you are now poised for
full recovery. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#27:1>
You will have to be patient, but I am confident and I
pray to God  
that you gain your full strength and spirits at the earliest. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#28:1>
As Debashish mentioned as he read your letter - -
Well, uncle  
certainly has not lost his sense of humour ! </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#29:1>
I am so very happy to know that both Patil & Laxmi
have been  
appointed. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#30:1>
<w> Laxmi's </w> appointment is a victory not only for
her, but for  
you & I, and for the cause of justice. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#31:1>
Please convey my heartiest congrats to her & to Patil.


<ICE-IND:W1B-005#32:1>
Only Pandey & his dynamism would bring victory. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#33:1>
I shall look forward to my next visit to Shivaji
University &  
specially to seeing you & the family. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#34:1>
Vijay unfortunately was down with such a sevre attack
of allergy that  
had affected even the joints & during the time of the
interview he was unable  
to move. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#35:1>
There was no way I could leave him & go to Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#36:1>
He has recovered but he continues to go through spells
of allergy  
quite frequently & remains quite disturbed about it. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#37:1>
Our seminar on Creative Writing with my sister
Bharati & her  
husband Clark, who is the Director of the International
Writing Program, Univ  
of Iowa, went off superbly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#38:1>
I am planning to send a proposal to UGC for DSA grant.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#39:1>
Keep well and do keep in touch. </p>

Dear Shastri 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#53:1>
It was good to hear from you & to know that you
are planning to  
relocate to <@> Rune </@> in the near future. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#54:1>
And its marvellous that you have succeeded in
persuading that wily  
<@> Laxman </@> to offer facilities in the Dept. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#55:1>
This means that your heroic effort on the corpus can
continue. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#56:1>
I am enclosing the questions provided in the format
for proposal. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#57:1>
However I notice that the questions are relevant to
publication of a  
text book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#58:1>
So I suggest that you select the items and write your
proposal  
accordingly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#59:1>
Atleast this series of items will help in structuring
your proposal.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#60:1>
From the annexures I am not very clear on what
stage the project  
is now at. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#61:1>
Has the UGC responded to request for funds on the
basis of the  
progress report ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#62:1>
Without sophisticated equipment, collection & analysis
& entry of  
data would be impossible.

Do keep me informed. </p>

the  
counteraction ( ! ) - - Dr. Katikar was unwell - - reason - -

for such a long time.

Yes, she has copies of the final product but as she
gave me to  
understand, there isn't much done by way of editing /
correcting. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#111:2>
2) Report-writing by MBA students in their subject of

time<->.</-> - - 55 minutes.

3) Yesterday, there was the annual seminar of our
M.B.A. students. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#114:2>

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#139:2>
Thank you for the call yesterday night.

As desired by you, I have just written a letter
to Dr ( Mrs.)

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#144:2>
I have also written that you are in the process of
contacting him. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#145:2>
You may <del> also </del> do so at your earliest so
that you will  
have some kind of assurance from his end. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#146:2>
Well, Dr. <w> Katikar's </w> health is not as
good as one would  
wish. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#147:2>
He suffered a <quote> ` silent' </quote> heart-attack
in the last  
week of July 96. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#148:2>
After 3 weeks of hospitalization he is O.K. but with
many  
restrictions, no moving out, no climbing stairs, and a heavy
diet of  
medicines. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#149:2>
The doctor who treated him here had advised us to go
to Pune for a  
second opinion. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#150:2>
We were in Pune <}> <-> bet. </-> <+> between </+>
</}> 16 and 25  
Feb.<+>,</+> when we had an appointment with a famous
cardiologist Dr.  
Hiremath. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#151:2>
<del> This wa </del> He advised a few tests which
included  
angiography and on the basis of it he has suggested bipass
procedure. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#152:2>
We are now exploring the possibilities <del> of
</del> <}> <-> reg.  
</-> <+> regarding </+> </}> when, where, by whom etc. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#153:2>
In any case we want to wait till 31 March, when I
shall be totally  
free. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-005#154:2>
One good ( but equally bad ! ) aspect of the
issue is that he  
himself is most disinclined to even talk about his illness. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#155:2>
Luckily, he is able and is allowed to move about in
the house, do a  
bit of his astrological consultancy ( which keeps him <del>
both </del>  
occupied and so happy <}> <-> - </-> <+> ; </+> </}> it gives
him a chance to  
meet people without moving out. ) but to any query <}> <->
reg. </-> <+>  
regarding </+> </}> his health he has a standard line - - <w>
I'm </w> fine !  
I - - all of <del> ou </del> us - - are in a tricky situation
- - a  
hush-hush atmosphere ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-005#156:2>
<w> It's </w> very difficult to answer calls
enquiring after his  
health - - since he is always around ! Well, <w> that's </w>
