<h> <&> chapter </&> 23 </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#4:1>
I <smallcaps> BECAME </smallcaps> an American in an apartment on
Claremont Avenue across the street from a Barnard College dormitory.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#5:1>
I lived with Taylor and Wylie Hayes for nearly two years.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#6:1>
Duff was my child; Taylor and Wylie were my parents, my teachers, my
family. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#7:1>
I entered their life on a perfect spring Sunday.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#8:1>
Kate and I left Sam in his corner of the loft, baking on a rock pile
underneath a sunlamp, in the middle of a <w> child's </w> plastic wading
pool, and took a bus all the way up Broadway to 116th Street, at the gates of
Columbia University.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#9:1>
The sky had a special penetrating blueness, the temperature and
humidity made it seem we were breathing through our skin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#10:1>
We went down the hill toward the river, then turned in at the first
building.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#11:1>
The street was Claremont Avenue and all the apartments belonged to
Columbia teachers, true <indig> professorjis </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#12:1>
I expected the air itself to crackle with so much intelligence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#13:1>
Wylie and Taylor and their little girl, Duff, met us with tea and
biscuits.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#14:1>
They were in their early thirties, and dressed like students in
T-shirts and cords.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#15:1>
Taylor had teeth as crooked as mine - the first crooked teeth <w> I'd
</w> seen in America - with a gap between his front teeth wide enough to hold
a matchstick.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#16:1>
He had a blondish beard.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#17:1>
Wylie was tall and blond, thin as a schoolgirl, with a pair of dark
glasses pushed high in her hair, and a pair of regular glasses resting on her
chest, held by a chain around her neck.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#18:1>
Duff immediately asked my name and where I was from.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#19:1>
<X> <quote> " You know where India is, darling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X20:1>
Remember, we found it on the map." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#21:1>
She took out a piece of paper and tried to spell my name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#22:1>
I had never seen a small child, especially a girl, who could
immediately relate to adults, call them by their first names, and break into
their conversations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#23:1>
She asked Kate, <X> <quote> " <w> Where's </w> my Sammy?"
</quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#24:1>
Kate reminded her that Sam and city buses were not on good terms.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#25:1>
The one time <w> she'd </w> taken him on a bus, wrapped like a baby
but for his breathing holes, the crested tail had popped from the blanket,
the tongue had darted, and a man sitting next to them had drawn a knife in
self-defense.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#26:1>
Thereafter she left him at home in what Duff called <w> Sammy's </w>
Ocean. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#27:1>
I asked what kind of pets the Hayeses had.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#28:1>
Fortunately, the university permitted nothing as exotic as iguanas
and snakes, only the usual dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils - none of
which Duff could tolerate because of allergies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#29:1>
<quote> " We might have to move if Duff wants an ostrich or
something," </quote> said Taylor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#30:1>
Duff giggled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#31:1>
Kate prompted me to smile. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#32:1>
Silence fell.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#33:1>
I nibbled a biscuit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#34:1>
<quote> " I hope

$95 a week is satisfactory," </quote> said Wylie.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#35:1>
<X> <quote> " <w> I've </w> checked around, and <w> that's </w> a
little low, but there really shouldn't be any other expenses - " </quote>
</X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#36:1>
I had not imagined money, <it> dollars </it> , for sleeping with
a child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#37:1>
<quote> " That is very good," </quote> I said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#38:1>
<quote> " <w> I'm </w> not going to ask you for references,
Jasmine," </quote> she went on.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#39:1>
<X> <quote> " <w> Kate's </w> already told us something about you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X40:1>
Lillian <w> Gordon's </w> word is solid gold with us.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X41:1>
You will be part of the family.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X42:1>
Families don't go around requiring references." </quote> </X>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#43:1>
<quote> " Anyway, Sam already approved you," </quote> said
Taylor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#44:1>
<X> <quote> " Being cold-blooded, he doesn't warm to many people.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X45:1>
In fact, he has a godlike perspective on the whole mammal class."
</quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#46:1>
He smiled his crooked-toothed smile, and I began to fall in love.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#47:1>
I mean, I fell in love with what he represented to me, a professor
who served biscuits to a servant, smiled at her, and admitted her to the
broad democracy of his joking, even when she didn't understand it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#48:1>
It seemed entirely American.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#49:1>
I was curious about his life, not repulsed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#50:1>
I wanted to know the way such a man lives in this country.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#51:1>
I wanted to watch, be a part of it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#52:1>
He seemed wondrously extravagant, that Sunday morning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#53:1>
<quote> " He likes to be rubbed on the stomach," </quote> I said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#54:1>
<X> <quote> " Fastest way to an iguanas heart.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X55:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#56:1>
<X> <quote> " Oh, Daddy, <it> really </it> ." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#57:1>
Duff frowned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#58:1>
<quote> " I can tell you are a refined person," </quote> Wylie
continued.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#59:1>
<X> <quote> " We ask only for affection and intelligence in dealing
with Duff.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X60:1>
A child raised by affectionate, intelligent people with a good sense
of humor will grow up all right." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#61:1>
<quote> " That, and getting into Brearley," </quote> Taylor
remarked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#62:1>
<quote> " I don't think I have much humor," </quote> I said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#63:1>
The decent Americans <w> I'd </w> seen on television seemed a
whimsical people, always making jokes, like Kate and Taylor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#64:1>
Wylie was a serious woman, all duty and business, like Lillian
Gordon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#65:1>
The ones <w> I'd </w> met in person were not too funny.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#66:1>
<w> Humor's </w> the hardest thing to translate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#67:1>
Duff, she said, was enrolled in a play school at the Riverside
Church.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#68:1>
This would leave my mornings free.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#69:1>
There would be lunch to prepare, her nap, and maybe strolls in the
park or trips around town.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#70:1>
Very little television.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#71:1>
I was to stimulate her with questions, engage her with stories, read
to her, go to museums, puppet shows, galleries.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#72:1>
Next year she might be in an all-day school, which would leave me
free to investigate classes myself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#73:1>
<w> They'd </w> help any way they could. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#74:1>
<X> <quote> " <w> You're </w> probably tired of Americans
assuming that if <w> you're </w> from India or China or the Caribbean you
must be good with children," </quote> </X> said Wylie. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#75:1>
<quote> " Thank you," </quote> I replied.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#76:1>
What else could I say?

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#77:1>
I had never heard such a thing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#78:1>
The Chinese I had always thought of as genetically cruel to women and
children - - even in Hasnapur we knew about foot-binders - and my experience
of Caribbeans was a mixture of fear and pity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#79:1>
<quote> " Ancient American custom, dark-skinned mammies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#80:1>
Don't be flattered by it," </quote> said Taylor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#81:1>
<quote> " In fact," </quote> said Wylie, <quote> " we assume <w>
there'll </w> be times when you absolutely hate her and want to wring her
neck." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#82:1>
<quote> " We suggest counting to ten first," </quote> said
Taylor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#83:1>
Duff was drawing and coloring and didn't raise her head. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#84:1>
Wylie showed me around.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#85:1>
<quote> " Sixteen hundred square feet," </quote> she said, <quote> "
so I don't think either of us will feel crowded." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#86:1>
She opened and shut doors of closets, pulled open drawers on the
smoothest of rollers, revealing gadgets I had no idea how to use, patted
dials on the dishwasher, and rested fingertips on the start-up panel of a
sleek microwave.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#87:1>
<quote> " If you have a thing about radiation, you don't have to use
it," </quote> she said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#88:1>
<X> <quote> " You just let us know when we upset you, all right?"
</quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#89:1>
<quote> " I don't have a thing about radiation," </quote> I said.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#90:1>
We stood on the narrow balcony and looked out on Claremont Avenue
as Wylie gave me facts about Taylor, Duff, and herself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#91:1>
Taylor, a <indig> professorji </indig> , was an expert in an area of
subnuclear particle physics.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#92:1>
Wylie was a book editor for a publisher on Park Avenue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#93:1>
About her work she said, dismissively, <X> <quote> " You can call my
writers the New Sob Sisters.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X94:1>
We ghoul around courtrooms and develop projects." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#95:1>
She explained about the money to be made signing up celebrity
interviews, writing about divorces and drug cases, society murders, child
abuse, and rape.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#96:1>
She made them sound like grave robbers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#97:1>
I didn't have the slightest understanding of anything they said,
and they didn't bother explaining.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#98:1>
I liked that the assumption behind it. </p> <&> three blank lines
</&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#99:1>
Wylie said that Duff was adopted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#100:1>
<quote> " Low sperm count," </quote> she explained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#101:1>
I blushed, but neither Wylie nor Taylor noticed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#102:1>
<quote> " Hockey injury," </quote> Taylor protested. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#103:1>
They planned to tell Duff everything when she was old enough.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#104:1>
<w> They'd </w> even let her meet her natural mother currently a
sophomore at Iowa State University.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#105:1>
Their lawyer had placed ads in small-town Iowa and Nebraska and
Kansas newspapers, asking pregnant unwed girls to contact him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#106:1>
Wylie and Taylor were paying for the <w> girl's </w> education.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#107:1>
I remember thinking an Iowa newspaper must be in a language called
Iowan, like a Punjabi or a Spanish newspaper.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#108:1>
I liked the mystery.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#109:1>
Duff looked perfectly American. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#110:1>
<quote> " We could have gotten a child out of Paraguay,"
</quote> Taylor explained.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#111:1>
<X> <quote> " The Needhams on the sixth floor got their baby from
Paraguay.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X112:1>
They had to go down and hang around for six weeks in this nothing
village full of Nazi war criminals, and the way they described the whole
thing, it sounded awful, sort of like a direct sale." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#113:1>
I could not imagine a non-genetic child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#114:1>
A child that was not my own, or my <w> husband's </w> , struck me as
a monstrous idea.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#115:1>
Adoption was as foreign to me as the idea of widow remarriage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#116:1>
I looked out into the dorm windows across Claremont Avenue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#117:1>
The windows were long, bright, shadeless rectangles of light.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#118:1>
No window shades, no secrets.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#119:1>
Barnard women were studying cross-legged on narrow beds, changing
T-shirts, clowning with Walkmans clamped to their heads.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#120:1>
They wore nothing under their shirts and sweaters.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#121:1>
Men were in their room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#122:1>
Even on the first morning I saw naked bodies combing their hair in
front of dresser mirrors.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#123:1>
Truly there was no concept of shame in this society.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#124:1>
<w> I'd </w> die before a Sob Sister asked me about Half-Face. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#125:1>
The love I felt for Taylor that first day had nothing to do with
sex.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#126:1>
I fell in love with his world, its ease, its careless confidence and
graceful self-absorption.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#127:1>
I wanted to become the person they thought they saw: humorous,
intelligent, refined, affectionate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#128:1>
Not illegal, not murderer, not widowed, raped, destitute, fearful.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#129:1>
In Flushing, I had lived defensively in the midst of documented
rectitude.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#130:1>
I did not want to live legally if it also meant living like a
refugee. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#131:1>
<quote> " <w> We'll </w> give you <w> Taylor's </w> study,"
</quote> Wylie said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#132:1>
<X> <quote> " <w> We'll </w> move his junk into the dining room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#X133:1>
<w> You'll </w> have your own room that way." </quote> </X> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#134:1>
<X> <quote> " Junk!" </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#135:1>
Taylor laughed.

<X> <quote> " Junk!" </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#137:1>
The gap made him look sardonic.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#138:1>
Back in his hockey-crazy town in upstate New York, <w> he'd </w>
lost a number of teeth and they were never replaced with bridgework, so the
teeth he had left - - chipped teeth, crooked teeth - had drifted and settled
deep in his gums, leaving gaps between them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#139:1>
The teeth seemed to mock whatever he said.

I could not imagine a small child sleeping alone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#147:1>
I had trouble enough with it myself, never having spent a night
alone until I got to Lillian <w> Gordon's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#148:1>
That was <w> Lillian's </w> pride: that she could give me <w> Kate's
</w> old room, by myself, not with the Kanjobal women.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#149:1>
I would have preferred sleeping on a floor mat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#150:1>
In Flushing I could at least hear the snoring of <indig> Professorji
</indig> and his father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#151:1>
I had lain awake in the Florida cottage, watching ghosts flit across
the ceiling, wrap themselves in the curtains, creak from room to room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#152:1>
When Kate had told me of a possible job looking after a child, I had
imagined myself in a narrow bed with a baby, and the thought had brought me
comfort. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#164:1>
He was out early, back late.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#165:1>
I prayed he was not sorting hair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#166:1>
Wylie put on a <w> martyr's </w> face.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#167:1>
<w> I'd </w> been sleeping on a cot in his room, folding it up by
day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#168:1>
All my T-shirts and cords fitted into a plastic bag in the closet.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#169:1>
They thought I wanted a room of my own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#170:1>
I had no way of telling them it wasn't necessary, that I worried
about Duff all alone with her animal paintings and stuffed dolls.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#171:1>
She was a lovely child, easy to look after.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#172:1>
She was the only American, at the time, that I was capable of
totally understanding.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#173:1>
For her, I was a wise adult without an accent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#174:1>
For me, she was an American friend whose language I understood
and humor I could laugh at.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#175:1>
And she laughed at mine.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#176:1>
I did have a sense of humor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-007#177:1>
She was a pale child with pale eyes and pale hair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#178:1>
When she raced ahead of me in Riverside Park and I pretended to
chase her, it was like chasing a milkweed parachute or a feather.

<ICE-IND:W2F-007#179:1>
I was learning about the stores, the neighborhood, shopping, from
her. </p> <&> three blank lines </&>
