<ICE-IND:S2B-046#1:1:A>
My dear ladies and gentleman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#2:1:A>
I would like to speak on the relevance of <,,> English education <,>
andbeyond <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#3:1:A>
In fact uh <,,> I am not going to deal with <,,> <mention> the
beyond </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#4:1:A>
I am going to speakonly on <,> <mention> The relevance of <,>
English education </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#5:1:A>
Uh let me start with the <,> background<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#6:1:A>
There was a time <,> when <,> <quote> The sun did not set<,> from
the British Empire </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#7:1:A>
That is <,> the Empire spread almost all over the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#8:1:A>
Along with the Empire the English language also spread all over the
world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#9:1:A>
Now the sun almost <,> does not arise on the British Empire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#10:1:A>
But <,,> the English language has now <,,> become <,> an
international language <,,> known all over the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#11:1:A>
What is more <,,> it is the <,> intelligentia of the world language
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#12:1:A>
Now <,> less than half of the globe <,> speaks English <,> as its
native speaker <,,> native language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#13:1:A>
They are the inhabitants of <,> Great Britain <,> U.S.A. <,> Canada
<,> Australia <,> New Zealand <,> the Caribbean <,> and South Africa <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#14:1:A>
And this accounts for <,> three hundred million speakers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#15:1:A>
In the rest of the world <,> Englishis used <,> in various other
parts <,> either as foreign language <,> or a second language <,> including
in the U.S.S. <,> R.<,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#16:1:A>
However restricted in its <,,> way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#17:1:A>
Roughly <,,> there are three <,> major speech communities <,>
spoken <,> all over the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#18:1:A>
First <,> <mention> The native speakers </mention> <,> second <,>
<mention> Second language speakers </mention> <,> and third <,> <mention>
Foreign languagespeakers </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#19:1:A>
The predominant position of English in the world <,,> had something
to do with two <,,> factors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#20:1:A>
One <,> is the colonisation of British Empire <,> among otherminor
European powers <,> towards the end of nineteenth century <,> and stabilized
in the <,> year twentieth century <,,> until the <,,> outbreak of <,,> <->
south <.> wo </.> </-> Second World War<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#21:1:A>
And secondly <,,> The independence from the British colonies from
the <,> end of Second World <,> War <,,> which has been <,> on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#22:1:A>
The latest as you know is Hong Kong <,,> which will be free in
nineteen ninety-seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#23:1:A>
After independence <,> the new countries <,,> were <,> confronted
with theproblem of national language <,> and or <,> official language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#24:1:A>
A few African <,> and Asian countries opted for <,,> English<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#25:1:A>
The transition <,> was not very easy <,,> as many factors were
involved <,> particularly the size of the country <,> and the <,> size of the
speech communities <,,> whether they are<,,> <.> mon </.> mono-lingual <,> or
multi-lingual <,> communities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#26:1:A>
The case of India is a very special one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#27:1:A>
One thing that happened to India after independence was that <,>
the number of <,> Princely States <,> thanks to <,> Sardar Patel<,> were <,,>
integrated into the erstwhile British Provinces <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#28:1:A>
Secondly <,,> we have already <,,> by this time <,> a <foreign> de
facto </foreign> <,> <foreign> lingua franca </foreign> <,> in fact <,> two
<foreign> lingua francas </foreign> <,> if you like <,> English <,> and Hindi
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#29:1:A>
Now the position of English in India <,,> is that <,,> at the
time of independence <,,> English was the <foreign> de facto</foreign>
official language <,,> but soon <,> after that we decided to accept Hindi as
our national language <,,> as <.> en </.> enshrined in the <,,> Indian
Constitution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#30:1:A>
Along with Hindi <,> we decided to continue with English as an
Associate Official Language for <,> fifteen years <,> from the <,,>
commencement of the Indian Constitution <,> in nineteen fifty <,> up to
nineteen sixty-five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#31:1:A>
In the meantime <,> wedecided to cultivate and develop Hindi <,> to
take over from English<,> in the hope that <,> it would be <,> relegated to
the position of foreign language <,,> that is <,> for restrictive
functions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#32:1:A>
And Hindi would take over fully <,> not only as a national language
<,> but also as the official language <,,> and as the <,,> <foreign> lingua
franca </foreign> <,> of the pan-Indian language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#33:1:A>
However <,,> during the period of fifteenyears <,,> something seems
to have gone wrong <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#34:1:A>
Perhaps <,,> because of one of the <,,> uh factors <,> that is the
<,,> creation of Linguistic States <,> the position of Hindi seems to have
suffered a setback <,,> and we had to continue English<,> as an associate
official language <,> indefinitely <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#35:1:A>
So <,,> at the moment <,> our national language is Hindi <,,> our+
official <,> language is English <,,> and our<foreign> lingua franca
</foreign> <,,> <mention> link language</mention> <,,> seems to be divided
<,> broadly speaking English and Hindi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#36:1:A>
These link languages cut across the two regions <,> north and south
<,> on the one hand <,> and the two sections of society all over the country
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#37:1:A>
English as second language in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#38:1:A>
It might be useful to remember at the backof our mind <,> the
concept of <mention> Second Language</mention> before we go on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#39:1:A>
<mention> Second language </mention> by definition fulfills <,>
four important functions <,> namely<,,> <mention> instrumental <,> regulative
<,> interpersonal <,> and imaginative </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#40:1:A>
In India <,,> the main instrumental and regulative functions are
<,> fulfilled by <,> education and administration <,> respectively <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#41:1:A>
The interpersonal function is fulfilled by <,> one of the link
languages that is English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#42:1:A>
It is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language <,,>
speakers <,> especiallythose who do not understand Hindi <,> or even if they
<,,> knowHindi <,> will prefer it to <,> English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#43:1:A>
Finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of
<,> well established literature namely <,> <mention> Indian writing in
English </mention> <,,> next only to native English literatures <,> such as
British <,> American <,> Australian <,,> Canadian<,> and other literatures
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#44:1:A>
<mention> The ups and downs in the position of English </mention>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#45:1:A>
We can discern <,,> two phase <,,> phases <,> in post independent
era of English inIndia <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#46:1:A>
The first up to nineteen sixty-five <,> and the second after that
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#47:1:A>
Even before independence the medium of instruction at <,> regional
language at the secondary schools and <,,> English as second <,,> languages
<,> was taught in <,,> all such schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#48:1:A>
There were of course <,> certain <,> English medium schools also
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#49:1:A>
And the medium of instruction was uh <,> English throughout
post-school level<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#50:1:A>
As early as nineteen forty <,,> nine <,,> <mention> The University
Education Commission </mention> recommended a gradual <,> change over of <.>
mediu </.> <,> medium of instruction+ from English to <,> Indian languages
<,> at the higher stage <,> <-> at the </-> also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#51:1:A>
The three languages <,> regional<,,> federal <,,> presumably Hindi
<,> and English <,> are to be studied at <,> <.> seco </.> <,> at higher
secondary and <,> university stages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#52:1:A>
In the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two <,> <mention> The
Secondary Education Commission</mention> recommended that the study of
English <,,> should be given importance in secondary schools <,> and
facilities <,,> shouldbe made available at the middle school stage <,> for
its study on an optional basis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#53:1:A>
Thus <,> English was taught <,> as a<,> main second language <,> at
the <,,> school system <,> in all the stages <,> and in all the <,> States
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#54:1:A>
It was taughtfor <,,> anything between four to seven years <,,>
partly or wholly as a compulsory subject <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#55:1:A>
The report of the <mention> Official Language Commission nineteen
fifty-six </mention> <,> made a clear cut distinction between <,,> <.> lan
</.> <,> English language <,> and English literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#56:1:A>
Hitherto<,> English literature was taught <,> even <}> <-> with
</-> <+> at </+> </}> the <,,> school stage <,> but now <,> the regional
languages had <,> already become the medium of instruction throughout the
secondary schools <,,> and gradually it was <,> being <,> used as a medium of
<,> certain <,,> faculties <,> even at the university stage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#57:1:A>
Under the circumstances <,> the position of English has undergone a
great change <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#58:1:A>
Inthe words of the report <,> uh <,,> I quote <,,> <quote>
English has to be taught <,> hereafter <,> as a language of comprehension<,>
rather than <,> as a <,> literary language </quote> <,> unquote <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#59:1:A>
After the creation of the Linguistic States <,> we witnessed one of
the most controversial <}> <-> issue </-> <+> issues </+> </}> <,,> in Indian
Education <,> that is the place of English <,> in our educational set up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#60:1:A>
From<mention> <indig> angrezi hatao </indig> </mention> <,> <quote>
Downwith English </quote> <,,> at one extreme <,,> to <quote> English as the
sole medium of education </quote> <,> at the other <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#61:1:A>
 were widespread <,,> unrest <,> and riots all over the country
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#62:1:A>
It is in this context that <mention> The Three Language formula
</mention> was <,> proposed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#63:1:A>
It was subsequently modified in the <,> Kothari Commission Report
<,> nineteen sixty-four sixty-six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#64:1:A>
<mention> The three language formula </mention> sought <,,> I quote
<,> <quote> to establish <}> <-> equally </-> <+> equality </+> </}>
with regard to the study of language between Hindi and non-Hindi <}> <->
speaker </-> <,> <=> speaking </=> </}> <,> areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#65:1:A>
It recommended that <,,> as against the third language <,> Hindi
<,,> along <,,> uh <}> <-> another <,,> <.> lan </.> </-> <=> another Indian
language </=> </}> <,> besides Hindi and English <,,> should be studied by
<,,> pupils in Hindi speaking area </quote> unquote <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#66:1:A>
This almost amounts to <,> punishment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#67:1:A>
There was no motivation whatsoever for the Hindi speaking <,> pupil
<,,> to learn another modern <+> Indian</+> language <,> modern <}> <->
English </-> <+> Indian </+> </}> language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#68:1:A>
Thus <,> <mention> The three language formula </mention> seems to
have failed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#69:1:A>
In the meantime <,> the role of English <,,> has undergone change
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#70:1:A>
As we have mentioned earlier <,> instead of English literature <,>
we have sought to cultivate <,> English language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#71:1:A>
Pioneering work has been undertaken by the Central Institute of
English C.I.E. Hyderabad <,,> created in nineteen fifty-eight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#72:1:A>
English began to be <,> considered as second language <,,> and the
appropriate methods of teaching English were <,,> proposed<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#73:1:A>
In course of time <,,> several other institutions like the Regional
Institute of English <,> R.I.E. <,> State Institute of English S.I.E <,> and
so on <,,> spread <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#74:1:A>
And on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously
increased<,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#75:1:A>
Not only in school level <,> but also at the college and university
levels <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#76:1:A>
The latest <mention> All India Education Commission Kothari
Commission Report </mention> <,> has advocated the study of <,> English <,>
on an optional basis<,> at the primary level <,> that is <,> from <,> fifth
to seventh <,,> and on <,> secondary basis at the secondary level <,> that is
<,> eight to ten <,> and again <,,> optional <,,> basis<,,> higher secondary
level <,> that is <,,> uhm eleven to twelve<,,> in its scheme of <,> seven
<,,> uh twelve year school <,,> and three year degree course <,> for the
entire country <,> that is <,> ten plus two plus three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#77:1:A>
And the position of English has been <-> prescribed sorry </->
described <,> as a <,,> library language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#78:1:A>
Today <,> <-> English is </-> <,,> English in India <,> is an
important <,> if not compulsory <,> secondary language <,> at all stages of
education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#79:1:A>
Now let me <,> uhm <,,> look at <,,> <mention> The National
Policy of Education </mention> and <,> <mention> Plan Action </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#80:1:A>
Two decades of intense planning and <,> implementation of mass
education <,> that is <,,> quantitative <.> improve improve </.> <,>
improvement <,> the government of India hasnow turned to the <,> qualitative
improvement of <,> uhimprovement of educational facilities <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#81:1:A>
In the year nineteen eighty-six <,> the national policy of education
and plan of action <,> popularly <,,> known as <,,> <mention> NPE </mention>
and <mention> POA </mention> <,> modified in nineteen ninety-two<,> were
launched <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#82:1:A>
It then reviewed the National Policy from nineteen sixty-eight to
nineteen eighty-six <,,> and noted that <,> there have been <,> slow progress
in the implementation of these recommendations <,> and emphasised the need
for a <,> dynamic approach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#83:1:A>
As far as the development of language is concerned <,> the medium of
instruction at the <,> university stage <,> has been <,,> unsatisfactory on
account of two factors <,> ( a) the preparation and production of these text
books<,,> has not <,> synchronised with the universities decision to switch
over <,> to <,> <}> <-> modern English </-> <=> modern Indian </=> </}>
languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#84:1:A>
And ( b) <,,> secondly <,> second<,> uhm uhm university teacher <,>
having received education through English <,> find it difficult to teach
through their <,> English language in Indian languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#85:1:A>
More importantly <,> the universities are reluctant to change their
medium ofinstruction in regard to <,,> Indian languages because <,,> the lack
of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#86:1:A>
There is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter
on higher education in this document <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#87:1:A>
However <,> the development of English language <-> trained </->
<,,> uh training institution is encouraged <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#88:1:A>
+ centres <,,> have been set up for <,,> imparting training to
English language teacher <,,> at <,> school stage<,> and <,,> have trained
one point five <indig> lakh </indig> of English teachers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#89:1:A>
Now <,,> among other things <,> the <,,> NPE suggests <,> the
delinking of degree requirement for employment <,,> wherever <,,> feasible
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#90:1:A>
One of themost important measures taken in respect of <,>
qualitative improvement of the <.> Engl </.> education <,> was the creation of
<-> institutes </-> <,,> institutions of <,,> excellence<,,> uh <mention>
Navodaya </mention> Vidyalaya <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#91:1:A>
Since nineteen eighty-six <,,> <mention> Navodaya </mention> <->
Vidya Vidyanagar Vid </-> <mention> Vidyalayas </mention> were set up in two
hundred and eighty districts <,> spread over <,> twenty-nine States <,> and
Union <-> Territories of </-> <,,> Territories for <,> children <,> who are
potentially high <,,> achiever <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#92:1:A>
<mention> Acharya Rammurthi CommissionReport </mention> notes <,>
that <,,> in the name of qualitative improvement of education <,> the
National Policy of Educationand Programme of <,,> Action <,,> have been
criticised for the<,,> <-> <.> reclu </.> </-> uh exclusion of the poor <,>
from the educational process <,> and he <,,> decries <,,> elitism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#93:1:A>
The relevance of English education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#94:1:A>
We have now to ask a question <,> how relevant <,,> English
education is <,> in our country ? <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#95:1:A>
<w> I've </w> been asked to make a statement not only about the
relevance of <,,> English education butalso beyond it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#96:1:A>
But <,,> first <,> <+> let me </+> make certain statements of the
first part <,> <mention> How relevant <,> English education is </mention> ?
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#97:1:A>
You will find from the <,> fifth uh fifth <,> <mention> All India
Education Survey </mention> of the NCERT nineteen ninety-two <,> compiled
in<,> nineteen eighty-six that is <,> ten years ago <,,> there were two major
language <,> <-> medium </-> <,,> uh medium schools all over the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#98:1:A>
One <,> <-> Hindi medium </-> <,,> <mention> Hindi medium schools
</mention> and two <,> <mention> English medium schools </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#99:1:A>
Apart from these<,,> there were several Indian language medium
schools <,> particularly mother tongue <-> languages </-> <,> language
schools <,,> which were <,> minor ones <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#100:1:A>
All put together <,> there were six point four <indig> lakh
</indig> of schools in the country <,> at all levels <,> primary <,> upper
primary<,> and secondary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#101:1:A>
Out of these <,> the majority of English medium schools account for
two point four four <indig> lakhs </indig> of <,> schools <,> followed by
<,,> uhm zero point nine nine <indig> lakh </indig> that is <,> less than one
<indig> lakh </indig> of Hindi medium schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#102:1:A>
That is to say <,> that all the media of instructions in the whole
of India <,> there were six point four <indig> lakh </indig> of schools <,>
outof which <,> English medium schools account for <-> four </-> two point
four four <indig> lakhs </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#103:1:A>
That is more than one third of all the schools in the entire
country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#104:1:A>
What is more interesting is that <,,> the English medium
schoolswere much more <,,> both in the urban <,> and the <-> ural </-> uh the
rural <,,> sections <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#105:1:A>
In the rural areas <,> there were seventy-five thousand Hindi
medium schools <,,> as against two <indig> lakh </indig> of English medium
schools that is <,> two and a half time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#106:1:A>
Similarly in the urban sector <,> there were only <,,> twenty-four
thousand Hindi medium schools as against uh <,,> forty-nine thousand English
medium schools <,> that is <,,> as much as double the number <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#107:1:A>
In that <,> there were more number of English medium schools in
rural areas <,> than in urban <,> ones <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#108:1:A>
These statistics <}> <-> <.> perve </.> </-> <=> pertaining </=>
</}> to the <,> prevailing year nineteen eighty-six <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#109:1:A>
Today in the year nineteen ninety-six <,> what <,> that is <,,>
ten year after that <,> what is the real situation ? <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-046#110:1:A>
We do not know the <,> statistics now <,> but <,> we can project
it <,> on an <-> impressional</-> <,,> uh impressionistic basis for example
<,> a small town my own place <,> Kolhapur <,,> </I>
