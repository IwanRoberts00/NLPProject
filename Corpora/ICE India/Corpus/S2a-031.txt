Professor Kamath <,,> professor Dixit <,,> professor Joshi <,,>  
other members of the <indig> Vidyaprasarak <,,> Mandali </indig> <,,> members  
of the staff <,,> of both the Kannada and the English high school <,,> my  
dear students <,,> ladies and gentlemen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#2:1:A>
I feel it an honour <,,> to have been invited <,,> to deliver the  
first <,,> Dr Maker endowment lecture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#3:1:A>
I should like to take this opportunity <,,> to compliment <,,>  
professor Kamat and his colleagues <,,> on the management of this institution  
<,,> to have thought of an activity <,,> in which the community around this  
school <,,> can participate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#4:1:A>
One of the weaknesses <,,> of educational institutions in our  
society <,,> has been their failure <,,> to forge active links <,> with the  
community outside <,,> we have talked about <,,> many ideas <,,> linking the  
school <,> with the society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#5:1:A>
We have talked of school school complex <,,> we have talked of  
school college complex <,,> we have also talked of school community complex  
<,,> but very little has been done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#6:1:A>
Although a great deal can be done <,> even within the limited  
resources <,> of the schools and colleges <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#7:1:A>
We have not been able to accomplish much <,,> in this very important  
<,,> task <,,> of forging creative link <,,> with the community outside <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#8:1:A>
The activities in the school <,> and in colleges <,,> are meant for  
the children and the teachers of those institutions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#9:1:A>
But there are very few if any <,,> activities <,> in which the  
public can participate <,> and feel one <,,> with the school <,> or with the  
college <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#10:1:A>
This failure <,,> has <,> affected the ability of the educational  
institutions <,> to draw vital sustainance <,,> financial and otherwise <,,>  
from the community <,> which is in a position to help the institution <,> in  
diverse ways <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#11:1:A>
I am happy therefore to note <,,> that the society approached <,>  
and received positive response from Dr Maker <,,> in whose name <,,> this  
lecture series <,,> is instituted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#12:1:A>
It is an honour for me <,,> to be the first <,,> speaker <,,> and I  
hope that for many many years to come <,> the experts on various subjects  
<,,> connected with education and society <,,> because that professor Kamat  
told me <,,> is the general topic <,,> education and society <,,> and under  
the rubbering of this general topic <,> more selected more specific topics  
<,> will be taken up <,> by experts for exposition in future lectures <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#13:1:A>
I have been <,,> I have chosen rather <,> not that I have been  
asked to <,,> the general topic was suggested to me <,> and I was given the  
option of selecting any particular topic under the <,> general theme of  
education and society <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#14:1:A>
And I have chosen to speak on education and development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#15:1:A>
At the very outset <,> one understands that education and  
development <,> is part of a larger question <,,> namely <,,> what is the  
relationship of education to society <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#16:1:A>
Historically <,,> the inter relationship between the two <,,> has  
never been universally accepted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#17:1:A>
The traditional view of education has been <,,> that it is geared  
<,,> to the specific <,> interest <,> aptitude <,> and needs of the  
individual <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#18:1:A>
And education is defined as <,> an activity <,,> whose purpose <,,>  
is to promote <,,> and develop <,> various aptitudes in the child <,,>  
cultivate active habits in him <,,> and develop such skills and values and  
attitudes <,,> as would finally result <,> in a well-rounded personality  
development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#19:1:A>
In other words <,,> education has most often been looked upon <,>  
as the principal <,,> means <,> of individualist purpose of developmemnt of  
ones own personality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#20:1:A>
It is his aptitude <,,> it is his interest <,> it is his need <,>  
to develop his own personality <,> that have constituted the main focus <,>  
of education as an activity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#21:1:A>
The question <,> and in my view the more important question <,,>  
what should such a <,,> educated individual do <,,> or <,,> what ought such  
an individual <,> educated <,> individual <,,> what ought such an individual  
to do for his society <,> or for his country is seldom raised <,> in the  
field of educational discussion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#22:1:A>
That is supposed to be <,> for each individual to decide <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#23:1:A>
We give him a package <,,> over a period of ten fifteen or twenty  
years of education <,,> cultivate certain attitudes in him <,> cultivate  
certain values in him <,> cultivate an outlook on life in him <,> and then we  
send him out in the wide world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#24:1:A>
Let him decide what he wants to do <,> whether he wants to lead a  
life <,> entirely devoted to personal development <,> or whether he wants to  
be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a  
decision which the individual is supposed to take <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#25:1:A>
Therefore <,,> before going into the specific question <,,> of the  
role of education in development <,,> it may be useful to raise the general  
question <,,> whether education is an end in itself <,,> or whether there are  
larger societal purposes which education must serve <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#26:1:A>
The question has acquired urgency in modern times <,,> because  
education has become <,> one of the key activities in the very process of  
modernisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#27:1:A>
Relationship between education <,> and society has become the most  
fundamental problem <,> of our age <,,> because education has become at once  
<,,> the principal means of preservation <,> as well as of change <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#28:1:A>
Traditionally <,> society has looked upon education as a process by  
which <,> to conserve <,> to enrich <,> and to transmit to succeeding  
generation <,> the accumulated knowledge <,> skills <,> beliefs and values  
<,> on which <,> the <w> society's </w> cohesion <,> and permanence depends  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#29:1:A>
But in more recent times <,> and especially in the developing world  
<,> and India belongs to the developing world <,> education has increasingly  
come to be looked upon <,> as one of the most potent instruments of  
development <,> and also of change <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#30:1:A>
As professor James Coleman <,,> said <,> and I quote <,> <quote>  
once regarded as essentially conservative <,> culture preserving <,> and  
culture transmiting institutions <,> education now tends to be viewed <,> as  
the master determinent <,> of all aspects of growth and change </quote> <,>  
unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#31:1:A>
Society has probably changed more <,,> in the last thirty years <,>  
than it did in the preceding three hundred years <,,> and this is equally  
true <,,> of both the developed world and of the developing world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#32:1:A>
It is this continuous <,> and often profound societal change <,>  
and the salient role of the education in it <,> that have brought to the fore  
the question concerning the nature of relationship <,> between education and  
society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#33:1:A>
Two major post second world war developments <,> account for this  
new awareness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#34:1:A>
One is the emergent from colonial rule <,> of the countries of Asia  
and Africa <,> whose leaders at once turned to education <,> as an effective  
instrument of modernisation and national development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#35:1:A>
The other <,> is the growing awareness among the industrially  
advanced nations <,> that in the continued emphasis on education lies the  
assurance <,> of their scientific <,> technological and industrial leadership  
<,> and even hegemony <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#36:1:A>
The earlier attitude <,,> of treating education as though <,> it  
were a self sufficient <,> and autonomous system <,> functioning in isolation  
of prevailing socio-economic realities <,> was largely abandoned in favour of  
the more positive concept of education <,> as a social sub-system <,>  
interrelated with <,> and interacting with other sub-systems like the  
economic sub- system or and the political sub-system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#37:1:A>
There are at least three ways <,> in which education has direct  
relevance to society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#38:1:A>
First is the way <,,> education produces <,> suitably trained  
persons in required number <,> to man the million institutions through which  
<,> society lives and grows <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#39:1:A>
This I call <,> the leadership function of education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#40:1:A>
Second <,> is the contribution education makes <,> to economic  
development <,> both in terms of skills and attitude <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#41:1:A>
Everywhere <,> and particularly in the developing countries <,> the  
belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship <,> between education and  
long term economic development <,> has become almost an article of faith <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#42:1:A>
The rulers of these countries <,> have been relying increasingly  
<,> on considerations of economic development to justify <,> greater state  
support <,> as well as greater state control of education <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#43:1:A>
Underlying this emphasis on economic development <,> is another  
article of faith <,> namely <,> that rapid economic development <,> is the  
minimum indispensable requisite <,> of democratic political development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#44:1:A>
I call this the development function of education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#45:1:A>
The third and equally important role of education <,> relates to  
its socialization <,> including political socialization function <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#46:1:A>
What do I mean by socialization function <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#47:1:A>
Socialization refers to that process <,> by which individuals  
acquire values <,> attitudes and feelings <,> towards the social system <,>  
and towards their distinctive role <,> in the social system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#48:1:A>
Every social system is based upon <,> its own unique value system  
<,> and seeks to perpetuate itself <,> by creating an <}> <-> <.> app </.>  
</-> <=> appropriate </=> </}> ideological support structure <,> through  
shared values and beliefs <,> among members of that society <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#49:1:A>
Education is the principal agency for this purpose <,> which begins  
at birth <,> and continues through both formal and non-formal ways <,> all  
through life <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#50:1:A>
For example <,> a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its  
members <,> values of freedom <,> tolerance <,> dignity <,> and autonomy of  
the human personality <,> justice and fair play <,> respect for truth <,> and  
belief in human reason <,> and its capacity to solve human problems <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#51:1:A>
A democratic society <,> also seeks to encourage <,> a healthy  
scepticism <,> towards authority and power <,> and especially towards all  
forms of dogma <,> and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#52:1:A>
I just now spoke <,,> of the increasing expectations from education  
<,,> in social development in political development as well as economic  
development <,,> and I used the word development <,,> not merely <}> <-> in  
the </-> <=> in the </=> </}> rather narrow sense of economic development <,>  
I used the term development in a more comprehensive sense <,> of economic <,>  
social as well as political <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#53:1:A>
As against the nineteenth century liberal view of education <,,>  
there is the other view of education <,> as an agent of change and  
development <,> and it is that view which prevails in India among official  
and non-official circles dealing with educational policy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#54:1:A>
It is argued <,> that India is not yet a free society <,,> <}> <->  
in a <.> fun </.> </-> <=> in a fundamental </=> </}> sense <,> if by freedom  
we mean something more than political independence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#55:1:A>
The Indian <w> society's </w> hierarchical structure <,,> its caste  
system <,,> inequitus economic system <,> and its anti-labour intellectual  
culture <,> are formidable barriers <,,> to its development as free society  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#56:1:A>
And education will have to make a major effort <,> to create a more  
egaliterian social order <,> as a means to real freedom <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#57:1:A>
Unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from  
the state <,> in India <,> and in other developing countries freedom means  
freedom from want <,> hunger <,> ignorance and disease <,> in the eradication  
of which <,> the state is expected to play <,> a pivotal role <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#58:1:A>
In such a situation <,> education for freedom <,> would have <,> a  
far more positive content <,> than is visualised in liberal education concept  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#59:1:A>
It would need to have <,> two components in its curricular content  
<,> to enable students to relate their educational experience <,> to their  
immediate social environment <,> by participating creatively in the  
transformation of that environment <,> to desired end <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#60:1:A>
The first component would consist <,> of the conserving aspect of  
education <,> and would be dealing with knowledge <,> information <,> beliefs  
<,> values and attitudes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#61:1:A>
The second would be <,> the participatory component <,> which would  
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect <,> such as work experience <,>  
or socially useful productive work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#62:1:A>
I do not have to <,> tell an audience of school teacher <,> what a  
mess we have already made <,> of both these useful concept of work experience  
<,> and socially useful productive work <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#63:1:A>
In India <,> education is critically relevant <,> in as much as it  
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending <,> but also  
managing development <,> and change which are two crucial input <,> in our  
pursuit <,> of a modern nation making <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#64:1:A>
Education being a catalystic having a catalystic role <,> it is  
wrong to look upon it <,> as a self-contained <,> neutral <,> and autonomous  
system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#65:1:A>
Rather it needs to be consciously oriented <,> towards the building  
up of India <,> as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals  
<,> of a rapid economic development <,> in which the standards of living <,>  
for all people will continually be rising <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#66:1:A>
Education is thus <,> a very important element in the process of  
development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#67:1:A>
But let me pause here for a moment <,,> and ask the question <,>  
what sort of development <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#68:1:A>
We all want to develop ourselves <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#69:1:A>
There are no two <,> opinions about that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#70:1:A>
And we want to develop as fast as we can <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#71:1:A>
No two opinions about that either <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#72:1:A>
But what sort of development do we want <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#73:1:A>
Because much will depend upon <,> our <,> clarity <,> in the  
conceptualization of <,> quote unquote development <,> that our curriculum in  
education <,> that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in  
schools and colleges <,> the character of the activities in schools and  
colleges <,> will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus  
we are able to build on this central concept of development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#74:1:A>
Until twenty or thirty years ago <,,> developing countries like  
India <,,> answered the questions <,> what sort of development do you want  
<,> by saying <,,> we want much the same sort of development <,> that  
industrialised countries of the west have achieved <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#75:1:A>
In other words <,> we want to imitate England <,> we want to  
imitate the United States <,> we want to imitate Germany Japan <,,> Soviet  
Union or France <,> we want <,,> to become <,,> like the western  
industrialised society <,,> whose high standards of living <,> have been made  
possible by a rapid process of industrialization <,> with central emphasis on  
basic industries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#76:1:A>
We want large scale industrialized <,,> civilization <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#77:1:A>
It is only when we have <,> that kind of process of development  
<,,> based on rapid industrialization of the economy <,> that we shall be  
able to call ourselves <,> modern India <,> a developed India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#78:1:A>
An India in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing  
standard of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#79:1:A>
That was <,,> the general acceptance of the western model <,,> and  
there was a near unanimity <,> on the need to adopt and imitate the western  
models of development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#80:1:A>
But now <,> things are changing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-031#81:1:A>
Things are changing both in India <,,> in other developing  
countries <,> but more importantly <,> things are changing in the industrial  
world <,,> the western world itself <,> as they have begun to see <,,> that  
the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not  
necessarily applicable all over the world <,,> </I>
