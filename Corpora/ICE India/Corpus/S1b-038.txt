<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#1:1:A>
Count down <,> to the Ayodhya <,> climax is on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#2:1:A>
And if you will stand <,> for a mixed <,> metaphor <,,> <-> the </->
<,> everything is about to reach <,> a crescendo <,> in <,> the next <,,>
four or five days

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#3:1:A>
And we have <,,> in this panel <,,> uh <,> Mr Soli Sorabjee <,> a
very well known lawyer <,> and <,> Mr P Upendra <,> member of Parliament

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#4:1:A>
I wish <-> we </-> to balance <,,> the panel we also had somebody
<,> from the establishment <,> and <,> uh a member <,> from the BJP <,> that
could have probably <,> made for a more <,> more meaningful discussion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#5:1:A>
But Soli <,> why don't we get down to the the basic point <,> the
legal aspect of it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#6:1:A>
Uh the Supreme court <,> has set certain things <,,> uh just to <,>
to clarify things for the viewers <,> what is that the Supreme Court had said
<,> and what are the implication <,> of what it has said <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#7:1:B>
The Supreme Court has restrained <,,> any construction activity
<,> on the site <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#8:1:B>
Be it of a permanent nature <,> or a temporary nature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#9:1:B>
The Supreme Court has also directed <,,> that no construction
material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#10:1:B>
At the same time <,,> having regard to the religious sentiments of
the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#11:1:B>
Having regards to the fact <,> the sculpture about the Ram <,> the
Supreme Court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent <,,> <indig>
karseva </indig> in the form of singing of <indig> bhajan </indig> <,,> and
certain religious versions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#12:1:B>
And that this part of the order the Supreme Court has emphasised
should be publicised and made clear to the <indig> kar sevak </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#13:1:B>
So that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and
what it is <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#14:1:B>
That is the net effect of the Supreme Court order as it is <,>
today in force

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#15:1:A>
But even as you and I are talking <,,> uh there is a matter
being before the supreme court now <,> just now <,> <{> <[> yes <,> and <,>
<}> <-> which is <,> which which <,> </-> <=> which is </=> </}> on what
basically focussing on that issue

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#16:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#17:1:B>
Well the petition is there <,> I think <+> you </+> want to
know what contengency plan the state government has <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#18:1:B>
Because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government <,>
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking <,> that they will
see that the mosque is not damaged <,> no construction activity takes place
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#19:1:B>
But <-> the </-> both thing they are out of hand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#20:1:B>
Because after all <,> all depends upon how many <indig> karsevak
</indig> gather <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#21:1:B>
What sort of speeches are made by various leaders there <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#22:1:B>
Suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a
situation <,> thereby the supreme court order cannot <-> be </-> comply <O>
one word </O> even despite the best efforts of the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#23:1:B>
Then what are the plans the government has I think <w> that's </w>
the application which is being <,> argued at the movement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#24:1:B>
<w> What're </w> the plans they have <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#25:1:B>
How do they want to prevent any damage to the <,> mosque

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#26:1:A>
What is your reading Mr Upendra <,> because uh <,> Kalyan
Singh has <,> said various things on this on this issue <,> the chief
minister of U P <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#27:1:A>
Uh <,> do you get a cacophony coming out of the <mention> BJP
</mention> camp <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#28:1:A>
Or do you <,> do you see a co-herent line of action <,> being
outlined <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#29:1:C>
No there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action
<,> even among themselves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#30:1:C>
Uh different tones are being heard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#31:1:C>
Apparently there is a <,,> difference of opinion also <,> among the
<,,> leaders of the <mention> BJP <,> Vishva Hindu Parishad <,,> Bajrang Dal
</mention> and others <,,> uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#32:1:A>
As it is <,> that must be within the <mention> Congress
</mention> camp also <,> I mean there must be difference of opinion

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#33:1:C>
But more or less here the <,> issue is very clear that <,,>
the mosque should be protected <,,> and the <indig> karseva </indig> should
not be done in violation of the <w> court's </w> order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#34:1:C>
This was <,> on this side the line of action is very clear

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#35:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#36:1:C>
But on the other side the matter has been <,,> complicated
with the supreme courts effective intervention <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#37:1:C>
And probably now <,> <mention> the BJP <,> the Vishva Hindu
Parishad the RSS </mention> and the <,> others <,> involved in this <,,> are
in a fix to <,> decide what to do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#38:1:C>
They can't abandoned the <indig> karseva </indig> <,> straight away
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#39:1:C>
And there has to be some action as announced by them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#40:1:C>
Because by announcing the <indig> karseva </indig> <,> even before
the talks have ended <,,> even before the final round of talks <,> are over
on the November eight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#41:1:C>
I feel they have got themselve into trouble <,,> inavoidable
trouble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#42:1:C>
Had they waited for the final round probably this situation would
have been avoided <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#43:1:C>
And today <,,> a responsible particular leadership <,,> I have
great respect for the leaders of the <mention> BJP </mention> <,,> who are no
doubt patriots <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#44:1:C>
They are very clear minded <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#45:1:C>
And the <mention> BJP </mention> the <,,> major opposition party in
the parliament running four state governments <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#46:1:C>
For they can't turn down and say we don't uh <,> accept the courts
order

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#47:1:C>
So <w> we'll </w> defy the court orders <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#48:1:C>
<w> That's </w> one predicament they are in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#49:1:C>
At the same time they have to keep up their own mandate <,,> of
building the temple <,,> and going ahead with the construction <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#50:1:A>
So <w> they're </w> in a dilemma

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#51:1:C>
Yes just now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#52:1:C>
And <O> two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#53:1:A>
Dilemma <,> sorry <,> <O> one word </O> go ahead

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#54:1:C>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#55:1:C>
Now it requires all the political sagacity on their part <,,> to
get out of the situation <,,> and uh I must say appreciate the <,> effective
intervention of the Supreme Court <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#56:1:C>
<w> They've </w> tried to save the situation both for the
government and the <,> the the other party <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#57:1:C>
And one should take advantage of this <,> position <,> and wriggle
out of this situation

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#58:1:C>
I don't know how they will do it in the next few days <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#59:1:A>
Do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the
<,> the <,> the whole <,> uh arena of uh <,> shall we say contest <,> and now
mm Mr Advani is going to <,> start from <,> Kashi <,> Kashi Vishvanath <,>
and I think <,> Dr Murali Manohar Joshi is starting <,> his <indig> Rath
Yatra </indig> from Mathura <,> and they all converging <,> converging in uhm
<,> Ayodhya on a certain date <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#60:1:A>
Is this <,> do you think <w> they're </w> widening the area of
contention or <,> is this the only <,> uh diversionary move that they have
<,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#61:1:C>
No they <,> they did a lot of explaining also <,> both for the
people and their cadres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#62:1:C>
Uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and
turn down the <,> uh contest and uh turn down the action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#63:1:C>
They have to explain it to the people

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#64:1:C>
Probably that is the part of <-> is this part of </-> their
campaign probably these people <-> have </-> <,> are going round the <,> from
the state <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#65:1:C>
But uh if you <,> analyse the situatiion in its entirety <,,> two
years back when <,,> Mr <&> name </&> government fell <,> on this very same
issue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#66:1:C>
The main issue was <,> how to protect the mosque <,,> and today <->
the </-> <,> it has the <,> problem has been extended outside the mosque <,>
to the land acquired <,> by the U P <,> U P government <,> on which they want
to do the <indig> karseva </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#67:1:C>
But the already problem has been now uh <,> extended <,> to outside
the this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#68:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> <O> one word </O> Soli the other <,> other area
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#69:1:A>
Soli there is another case before the Allahabad High Court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#70:1:A>
On the acquisition of the land <,> and the expectation was that a
judgement should come before the <indig> Dharam Sansad </indig> of the force
<,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and therefore the <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#71:1:A>
But apparently <,> they <-> I they </-> have been <,> uh now they
are going to get the judgement only on the seventh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#72:1:A>
<}> <-> Is is is that your </-> <,> <=> is that your </=> </}>
understanding

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#73:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#74:1:B>
Well I don't know about fix case <,> but in their acquisition
proceeding <,> the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the
tourism

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#75:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#76:1:B>
<w> It's </w> challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior
purpose

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#77:1:B>
But Syeed what I want to <,> a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#78:1:A>
Why did they arrange that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#79:1:B>
The fact is that <,> these orders are passed in interim
nations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#80:1:B>
The Allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a
decision <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#81:1:B>
And <w> they've </w> been <O> one word </O> December <,> but it may
be soon thereafter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#82:1:B>
So I don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any
responsible political leader <,> in complying with the supreme court orders
which they do not construct till that time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#83:1:B>
And in the mean time as Upendrajee said there is a dilemma created
by their own <,> uh uh doings and action which very well they were very
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma <,> by complying with the
supreme <w> court's </w> order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#84:1:B>
Because supreme court has announced us <,> to its not its not
complete this of the <indig> karseva </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#85:1:B>
The <indig> <w> karsevak's </w> </indig> aspirations also can be
fulfill <,> they don't feel frustrated <,> that they have it <-> will </->
build up that they are going to <indig> karseva </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#86:1:B>
Okay have a <indig> karseva </indig> in a symbolic form <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#87:1:B>
Held in this particular manner <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#88:1:B>
My uh problem is <,> that <,> why does I say we do not dump the
sincerity of any of the person <,> but suppose by their action or omissions
they allow a situation to be created <,> whereby the protection of the mosque
may become very difficult <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#89:1:B>
What I am trying to drive at is that there is still the
responsibility <,,> on the part of the central government also to see that
the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident <,> may lead to unleashing
of passions and <{> <[> argument </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#90:1:A>
<[> The state </[> </{> the state government in fact has
complained <,> that <w> you've </w> been rushing in forces without taking the
state government into confidence

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#91:1:A>
What is the constitutional position of that one ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#92:1:B>
Well that it is a debatable point

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#93:1:B>
Formally there was a provision in the constitution <,> I think it
was article two fifty-seven A <,> I may be mistaken I think it was that <,>
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces <,,> in the
state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#94:1:B>
Now that has been deleted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#95:1:B>
But at the same time there is another constitutional provision
which makes it the duty of the Union to protect the state <,> against the
external aggression which is not here at all <,> <{> <[> uhm uhm <,> or
internal disturbance <,> that also <O> one word </O> will know internal
distrurbance or <,> to see that the government of the state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#96:1:B>
Now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the
order of highest court has to be respected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#97:1:B>
If you do not respect the highest <w> court's </w> order <,> if you
flop the order of the supreme court then it is <,> very arguable that you are
not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that
may enable the central government to take the forces

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#98:1:B>
But as I said I would not like to be dogmatic about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#99:1:B>
But <w> it's </w> not a question if I can say so Syeed on
constitutional provision interpretation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#100:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#101:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#102:1:B>
The whole question is to see that the whole things are very
subject matter of the dispute if I may say so <,> is not damage or destroyed
when the decision is given <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#103:1:A>
Right

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#104:1:C>
No there is another point which I want to add here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#105:1:C>
On this very point today the Home Minister made a clarification in
the <indig> Rajya Sabha </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#106:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#107:1:C>
He said that <quote> the Utter Pradesh government was
informed of the <,> deployment of this additional forces in the state
</quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#108:1:C>
<w> That's </w> why I don't think there is any scope for
controversy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#109:1:B>
No that mean <}> <-> it is a </-> <+> <w> it's </w> </+> </}>
consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as <w> I've </w> said but
their <O> one or two words </O> <{> <[> really get great </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#110:1:C>
<[> But that </[> </{> <O> a few words </O> <w> it's </w> not
uh <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#111:1:C>
As far as that prior consent should be taken

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#112:1:C>
The state government must be informed <,> central can move its
forces wherever it want it wants <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#113:1:C>
But deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state
government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#114:1:C>
<w> That's </w> very clear <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#115:1:A>
Now the other question which you in fact did not answer <,>
answer fully Soli <,> that this act interim order <,> on the land acquisition
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#116:1:A>
Now supposing this the high court says <,> okay uh <quote> it it
was <-> a </-> you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree
with you </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#117:1:A>
Thereafter but <,> the purpose for which the land was acquired was
tourism <,> and religious tourism and so on and so forth

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#118:1:A>
But if <,> taking advantage of that you go ahead and do <indig>
karseva </indig> <,> then are you violating a court order even so <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#119:1:B>
You know <,> <{1> <[1> yeah <,> the question <-> is </->
depends on the terms of the court order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#120:1:B>
If the court order has restrained <,> construction activity <,>
<{2> <[2> uhm uhm <,> till the decision is given then you violate the court
order if you do construction activity

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#121:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#122:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#123:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#124:1:B>
But Syeed I think the crux of the matter is <,> and <w>
that's </w> another thing which I think we should all apply our minds to <,>
about why cannot the highest court <,> either by way of a reference or under
article one thirty-eight <,> by enlarging jurisdiction <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>
decide that the basic issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#125:1:B>
Because now the controversy is narrowed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#126:1:B>
Now the issue is a historical fact <,> was there a temple <,> on
the site <,,> ? <SA>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#127:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#128:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#129:1:B>
Was the temple destroyed <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#130:1:B>
And has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the
temple <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#131:1:B>
Because as far as <w> I'm </w> understood <,> the muslim
leadership has also accepted the position <,> that if it is established <,>
<{> <[> uhm uhm <,> that there was a temple <,> and it was destroyed then the
mosque has no business to <,> be on that place <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#132:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#133:1:B>
Now <w> that's </w> an issue which is capable of judicial
determination <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#134:1:B>
I can't understand people saying court can't decide that <,> that
is something about religious <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#135:1:B>
We are not here trying to ask to determine the birth <,,> place of
Rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#136:1:B>
Just a historical fact <,> which can be established one way or the
other on the basis of evidence <,,> <{> <[> and </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-038#137:1:A>
<[> Now </[> </{> if we go back on that point

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#138:1:A>
<-> I if </-> last week I think it was that the whole debate
started

<ICE-IND:S1B-038#139:1:A>
Whether <,> one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?
</I>
