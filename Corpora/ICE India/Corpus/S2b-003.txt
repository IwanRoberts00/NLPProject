Gold has always been considered a status symbol in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#103:1:B>
In addition <,> people buy gold for security <,> and this keeps
them interested in its prices <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#104:1:B>
The abolition of the Gold Control Act has resulted in a
fluctuation in gold prices <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#105:1:B>
We have this <,> report from our correspondent Maya Sharma <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-003#106:1:E>
Gold in our country <,> is a precious symbol of wealth and
security <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#107:1:E>
But the gold market itself <,> does not glitter quite so much <,>
involving as it does <,> inflated prices and large scale smuggling <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#108:1:E>
The <w> government's </w> decision to abolish the Gold Control Act
<,> was followed by an initial drop in the gold price <,> from pre-budget
level <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#109:1:E>
But the cost of gold in India continues to be much higher <,> than
in the international market <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#110:1:E>
The domestic demands of gold <,> is estimated at two hundred and
fifty tonnes every year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#111:1:E>
Less than two tonnes is produced by Indian mines annually <,,> and
about fifty tonnes is obtained from recycled gold <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#112:1:E>
The huge gap between supply and demand is filled to a large extent
by smuggled gold <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#113:1:E>
Those in the trade believe the current blanket ban on gold import
<,> should be lifted <,,> arguing that this should bring down the gold prices
<,> encourage export of jewellery <,> and also curb smuggling <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#114:1:E>
The government stand is that gold is not an essential item <,> to
justify expenditure of foreign exchange to import it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-003#115:1:E>
Whatever the <w> government's </w> decision <,> and regardless of
the price <,> the desire for gold is only likely to increase <,,>
