<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#1:1:A>
This man was lucky <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#2:1:A>
Mr Doraswamy <,,> who has been in captivity now for weeks <,,> of
agonizing weeks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#3:1:A>
Agonizing both for his family <,,> and for the nation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#4:1:A>
We still don't know when he is <,> and if he is going to be released
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#5:1:A>
Now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#6:1:A>
But holding hostages <,,> is even worse <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#7:1:A>
We have here now <,> on my immediate left <,,> Mr George Verghese
<,,> the distinguished journalist <,> and Mr Jamanadas Akhtar <,> the
distinguished writer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#8:1:A>
Both happened to be members of the Press Council <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#9:1:A>
But we have resisted the temptation of discussing <,> <w> George's
</w> famous report <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#10:1:A>
Because <,> George has better <,> face his critics <,> not his
supporters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#11:1:A>
Now George <,> would you give us some of the national <,> and
international dimensions of <,> this holding hostages <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#12:1:B>
Well taking of hostages has been <,> with us for sometimes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#13:1:B>
Uh throughout history hostages have been <,> used as a means of
building up pressure <,,> on authority of whatever kind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#14:1:B>
In more recent times we have seen <,> high-jacking <,> as taking up
hostages in the air <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#15:1:B>
Whole groups of <,> perfectly innocent people <,> who are flying
from <,> one place to some other destination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#16:1:B>
And using that <,,> to ask for <,> whatever it is <,> left the
captors wanted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#17:1:B>
Around the ground as <w> we've </w> seen <,> in many part of the
world and in our own <,> country <,> uh the taking of hostages is again being
used <,> as a means to pressurise <,> authority <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#18:1:B>
To use to specific demands <,> that are made <,> by various <,>
groups that take them <,> in captivity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#19:1:B>
<w> We've </w> just <,> seen the clip about <,> the Swedes <,> who
were taken hostages in Kashmir <,> and U F F to Mr Doraswamy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#20:1:B>
But we have the same problem <,> in other parts of India <,> in
Assam <,> in Andhra Pradesh <,> may be in Punjab <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#21:1:B>
And in other parts of the world <,> in Iran <,> in Lebanon and uh
<,> elsewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#22:1:B>
So that this is becoming a universal phenomenon <,> and one which
<,> civilize nations <,> and government <,> and communities have to fight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#23:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not an easy task <,> because it is traumatic <,> both
for the individuals and their families <,> as well as to the governments who
have to decide <,> and <,> for the community at large <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#24:1:A>
Miss Akhtar with a special <,> background of Kashmir
connection <,> would you like to through some light <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#25:1:C>
Yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#26:1:C>
I would like to <,> confine myself <,> <+> to </+> the problem in
Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#27:1:C>
I remember that in <,> nineteen seventy-seven <,> when I was in
Birmingham <,> the Kashmir Liberation Front leaders were there

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#28:1:C>
They had their headquarters <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#29:1:C>
They had abducted <,,> a senior diplomat from the <}> <-> India
</-> <+> Indian </+> </}> High Commission <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#30:1:C>
They wanted to get <,> release Mr Makbul Butt <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#31:1:C>
But when the government didn't release <,> they killed <,> that
Indian diplomat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#32:1:C>
And after <,> that Makbul <}> <-> Gutt </-> <,> <=> Butt </=> </}>
was hanged in Tihar jail <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#33:1:C>
The same <,,> Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front <,> British <?>
news alleged </?> <,> Major Amanulla <,> had their head quarters in
Muzaffarabad <,> and also in Karachi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#34:1:C>
<}> <-> He went </- > <=> he <,> run </=> </}> away to America <,,>
when the government wanted to arrest him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#35:1:C>
He <}> <-> came back to Kashmir and </-> <=> came back to Kashmir
</=> </}> and Pakistan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#36:1:C>
He organized a gang <,,> and he started terrorism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#37:1:C>
Uh at <-> the </-> first <,> uh his <,> uh party didn't <,,> uh
indulged in kidnapping <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#38:1:C>
But <w> there're </w> other groups in Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#39:1:C>
The main group is Hizbul Mujahideen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#40:1:C>
It is controlled by the Jamait-e-Islami of Pakistan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#41:1:C>
And its head in Pakistan is <,> Kazi Hussain Ahmed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#42:1:C>
<}> <-> This </-> <=> this </=> </}> Jamait <,> as you remember I
think <,> that in the last phase of the Bangladesh government <,> these
Jamait Islami workers <,> they picked up several <,,> uhm professors <,>
doctors <,> and others <,> and killed them <,,> in Dacca <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#43:1:C>
And this Jamait Islami <,> it was accused of <,,> uh hiring the
services of <,> uhm of Sayed Akbar <,> who had assassinated Mr Liyakat Ali
Khan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#44:1:C>
Another worker of the Jamait Islami <,> had assassinated Dr Khan
Sahib <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#45:1:C>
And now <,> they have uh <,> so many workers <w> there're </w> so
many terrorist <,> <}> <-> <.> a a </.> </-> <=> armed </=> </}> terrorist
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#46:1:C>
They had uh <,> fighting

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#47:1:C>
They were fighting in Afghanistan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#48:1:C>
Then they shifted to Muzaffarabad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#49:1:C>
They are infiltrating into <-> Kashmir </-> valley of Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#50:1:C>
And mainly this <,> this gang is responsible for kidnapping <,> the
uh <,> intellectuals <,> professors <,> engineers and others

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#51:1:A>
You imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#52:1:C>
Yes it is actively involved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#53:1:C>
<}> <-> He will not <,> it will </-> <=> he will not </=> </}> say
that he is actively or <,> any way involved <+> in </+> it

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#54:1:C>
For instance <,> in ninety-seven <,> forty-seven <,> when Pakistan
attacked Kashmir <,,> the Pakistan government said <quote> no <w> we're </w>
not involved <+> in </+> it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#55:1:C>
These are some tribals <,> who are <,> who has gone there to help
their brothers </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#56:1:C>
In sixty-five <,> when Pakistan again attacked Kashmir <,> General
Ayub Khan said <quote> no we are not concerned with it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#57:1:C>
The people of Kashmir has <,> risen in rebellion </quote> <,> in
nineteen seventy-one they attacked <,> again Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#58:1:C>
And when general Zia <-> at uh </-> induced <}> <-> <.> or </.>
</-> <=> organized </=> </}> <-> a </-> rebellion in <,> in Afghanistan he
said <quote> no <w> we're </w> not concerned with the rebellion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#59:1:C>
<w> We're </w> just helping these <,> uh uh <indig> sharnarthis
</indig> from <,> Afghanisthan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#60:1:C>
<w> We're </w> not giving anything <,> uh uh arms or weapons or
other anything to these <,> uh persons </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#61:1:C>
Now this same group <,> headed by that <,> Gulbadan Hikmat Yar <,,>
is organizing these raids <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#62:1:C>
<{> <[> Pakistan </[> government is supplying weapons <,,> and <,>
we know <,> that what is going <,> going on in Karachi now <,> Jamait Islami
says that its workers are being kidnapped and <,> and tortured and
assassinated in Karachi by their political elements <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#63:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#64:1:A>
Are there training schools for kidnapping too <,> do they

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#65:1:C>
Yes they have <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#66:1:C>
<}> <-> They </-> <=> they </=> </}> have kidnapping and training
schools for kidnapping <,> and terrorism <,> around Muzaffarabad <,> and then
in tribal area <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#67:1:A>
George do you agree with this <,> uh analysis or view <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#68:1:B>
Well I <w> I'm </w> not sure about the background and the <,>
uh details

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#69:1:B>
Because <,> question of kidnapping and hostages is not confined <,>
to Kashimr as I said <w> it's </w> a phenomenon <,> one finds <,> uh in <}>
<-> many </-> <=> many </=> </}> places in our own country and abroad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#70:1:B>
The question is <,> why is it done <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#71:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a form of psychological warfare <,> to build pressure
<,> whether for political aims or for other aims <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#72:1:B>
Now in Kashmir there are several groups <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#73:1:B>
You mentioned <,> the Swedes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#74:1:B>
I think <,> uh they were <,> detained by particular group <,> I am
not sure whether <,> <{> <[> Jungbaz Jungbaz <,> the the Jungbaz force <,>
<w> I'm </w> not sure whether it is the same group that has uh <,> kidnapped

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#75:1:C>
<[> Jungbaz Jungbaz </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#76:1:A>
Is it true that the groups run into hundreds now <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#77:1:C>
More <{> <[> than one </[> hundred

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#78:1:A>
<[> What the </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#79:1:A>
More <,> the official count is about one hundred and
forty-three

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#80:1:C>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#81:1:B>
But here again <,> the the problem that the authorities face
<,> is in dealing with <,> uh a multitude <,> of different groups <,> which
have perhaps different <,> sub-motivations within a larger purpose <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#82:1:B>
And the question that the country has to face is whether in the
Kashmir or elsewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#83:1:B>
How does one deal with this <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#84:1:B>
Does one submit ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#85:1:B>
Does one give in <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#86:1:B>
Or does one hold out <,> and with what consequences ? <,> <{> <[>
but it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#87:1:B>
I think this is the central issue that needs to be faced <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#88:1:A>
<[> But it </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#89:1:A>
It it <,> suits our friendly neighbour <,> to have as many
groups as possible

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#90:1:A>
So that <,,> you know you can't deal with anyone particular <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#91:1:A>
<{> <[> So </[> that no political solution is possible <,> isn't it
<,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#92:1:B>
<[> Well </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#93:1:B>
Well that <,> well that may be so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#94:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#95:1:B>
But as I would say if one looks at the problem in Assam <,>
Alpha <,> or peoples war group <,> in Andhra <,> <w> it's </w> a different
set of circumstances there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#96:1:B>
But kidnappings <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> have been used as a prime
instrument <,,> of pressure

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#97:1:B>
Therefore <w> it's </w> not just Kashmir <,> and I think we need to
look at this not as isolated problems

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#98:1:B>
Kashmir or Andhra <,> or Assam or anywhere else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#99:1:B>
But to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the
problem that could adopt <,> anywhere for the variety <,> of political <,>
and other reasons

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#100:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#101:1:A>
But you see <,> even the former Home <,> <w> Minister's </w>
<,> daughter <,> was kidnapped <,> and there was prompt action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#102:1:A>
One criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the Home
Minister of the country <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#103:1:C>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#104:1:A>
Now in the case of others <,> it drags on as in case of
Dorayswamy for weeks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#105:1:A>
Would you view this as a moral problem <,> as a legal problem <,>
as a national problem <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#106:1:A>
How would you categorise this problem George <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#107:1:B>
Well <w> it's </w> not a legal problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#108:1:B>
<w> It's </w> <,> really illegal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#109:1:B>
<w> It's </w> beyond the bounds of the law and <,> and <,> and the
constitution

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#110:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#111:1:B>
It is a moral problem <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and a political
problem

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#112:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#113:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#114:1:B>
The kidnapping of the Home Minister the former Home Minister
Mufti <,,> uh <w> Sayeed's </w> daughter <,,> uh Rubia <,> Sayeed was perhaps
the first of this latest series <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#115:1:B>
And may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new
chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release <,>
uh to negotiate <,> with the <,> uh captors of this young lady and secure her
release

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#116:1:B>
And the other view was the government should have held out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#117:1:B>
Because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman
<,> which was considered to be <,> unIslamic <,> against any of the
traditions that were being upheld <,> uh as the course which <,> the struggle
was being waged <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#118:1:B>
But for what ever reason the government <,> gave in <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#119:1:B>
I must confess that I myself for that time went along with the
feeling that all right <,> if the release <,> is granted <,> uh and <,> this
young hostage is released Miss Sayeed <,> uh may be <w> that's </w> a good
thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#120:1:B>
But I think perhaps we need to think afresh <,> because once that
<}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> happened <,> it has made it more difficult
for the government in <,> successive cases <,> to take a stand because the
question immediately <,,> uh raised is <,> well <,> why aren't you
negotiating <,> for the release of this hostage <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#121:1:B>
Is it because <,> he or she does not have <,> a Home Minister <,>
as a father <,> or some other <,> very important person <,> as a brother <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#122:1:B>
And <,> does not the life of an ordinary average person count as
much <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#123:1:B>
That is the dilemma that we now face <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#124:1:B>
Perhaps the time has come <,> when I think across the board <,> we
have to take a view <,> whether it is Kashmir <,> or Andhra <,> or Assam or
<O> one word </O> <,> or anywhere else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#125:1:B>
Whether it is a government of one complexion or another <,> call
an all party meeting to take a national view <,> of how the nation should
deal with hostages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#126:1:B>
Otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line
everywhere <,> by anybody <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#127:1:A>
What do you think Miss Akhtar Mansoor

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#128:1:C>
<O> Two word </O> I feel <,> that there is no difference <,>
between <,> kidnapping for ransom <,> or kidnapping for putting pressures <,>
to get the criminals released <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#129:1:C>
What happens <,> a man murders <,> six seven eight <,> twenty <}>
<-> <.> per </.> </-> <=> persons </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#130:1:C>
When he is arrested <,> his party <,> kidnaps any person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#131:1:C>
Maybe two three four persons

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#132:1:C>
A professor may be a doctor may be engineer or <,> or a high
official <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#133:1:C>
And they say <,> that <,> you release our criminal friend <,>
otherwise we will assassinate <,> your persons

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#134:1:A>
Yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#135:1:C>
Now <,> this is I think this is a <,> crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#136:1:C>
And no government should <,,> give in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#137:1:C>
What happens when you start releasing <,> these <-> the </->
persons <,> the kidnappers <,> they feel that their position has become
strong <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#138:1:A>
George if I may express my own view <,> <quote> life is more
complex <,> than <,> particular <,> formulation </quote>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#139:1:C>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#140:1:A>
Uh there can not be a white and black case of <,,> either you
release or not release <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#141:1:A>
Situations will differ <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#142:1:A>
Circumstances will differ <,> personalities will differ <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#143:1:A>
How <,> and in a democracy <,> public opinion will met <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#144:1:B>
Well personalities will <,> differ yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#145:1:B>
But will principles <,> differ ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#146:1:B>
That is the question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#147:1:B>
And I think as <,> Jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining
<,> with criminals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#148:1:B>
Take the case of Mr Doraswamy <,,> some people have been released
<,> as part of the bargain <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> which was not kept <,> by the
other side <,> according to the government <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#149:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#150:1:B>
Uh the kidnappers want <,> one of their leaders I think it is
uh <,> Mr Shalla <,> to be released <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#151:1:B>
Now according to the official <,> version <,> Mr Shalla was
responsible <,,> uh for the killing <,> earlier <,> of uh <,,> some hostages
<,> including Prof <}> <-> <.> Na </.> </-> <=> Nashirul </=> </}> Huque <,>
the very distinguished <,> Vice Chancellor of Kashmir University <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#152:1:B>
And subsiquently <,> Mr Khera <,> the General Manager of the H M T
plant <,> in Shrinagar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#153:1:B>
Now if <,> because of the pressure of Mr <w> Doraswamy's </w>
kidnapping <,> a killer of two other hosteges earlier <,> is to be released
<,> then what is the principle <,> involved <,> and where <}> <-> is </-> <+>
will </+> </}> it end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#154:1:B>
Because this will <-> be </-> go on <,> from one hostage to
another <,> and the government will be made to yield <,> all along the line
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#155:1:B>
And that would be unacceptable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#156:1:B>
I think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm
<,> there is no black and white <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> that is true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#157:1:B>
But some governments <,> the Israeli government for instance has
taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#158:1:B>
And let the kidnappers <,> face the consequences <,> of killing
<,> their hostages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#159:1:B>
Let public opinion <,> and their own <,> people turned against
them <,> because they too are under psychological pressure <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#160:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#161:1:A>
So I think we need to take a national view

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#162:1:A>
Otherwise I can't see <,> this problem <,> being uh <,> whisked
away <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#163:1:A>
<w> It's </w> going to sail us <,> week after week <,> in one
situation or another <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#164:1:A>
What I think we need to do <,,> is that <,> to get together all
political parties <,> to discuss this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#165:1:A>
What should be the national policy that is taken <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#166:1:A>
Whether it is a Congress government in Andhra <,> uh Congress
government in <,> uh <{> <[> Assam </[> <,> and opposition government in some
other place <,> <w> President's </w> rule <,> George

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#167:1:C>
<[> Assam </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#168:1:B>
Frankly I I <O> one or two words </O> any unanimity on any
problem in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#169:1:B>
Name me one problem on which the country <,> is whole heartedly
<,> unanimously agreed <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#170:1:A>
Well if it is not easy <,> but I think if one tries to be
still what are the principles <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#171:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#172:1:A>
Are all hostages of the same ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#173:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#174:1:A>
Is the motivation the same ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#175:1:A>
Is it political ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#176:1:A>
Is it criminal ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#177:1:A>
What is the background <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#178:1:A>
Can one then <,> distill some principles on the basis which public
opinion will assert itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#179:1:A>
Certainly it is one thing to negotiate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#180:1:A>
But I think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking <,>
of wearing down the opponent

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#181:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#182:1:A>
Get them confused <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#183:1:A>
Get them to contridict themselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#184:1:A>
Develop rival force and pressures in the other camp <,> weaken
their resolve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#185:1:A>
Give more time to investigative forces to find out where these
hostages are <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#186:1:A>
See if <,> if they can be rescued

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#187:1:C>
I think <{> <[> that </[> barring a <,> two or three
political parties <,> extremist may be in Punjab <,> all other political
parties <,> will join hands and support the government if the government <,>
wants to take some strong step <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#188:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#189:1:A>
George would you <,,> favour <,> that there should not be
compromise at any cost <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#190:1:A>
What is your personal view ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#191:1:B>
Well as I say I started out in this round <,> <{> <[> ah <,>
personally taking a view that is alright <,> if Rubia Sayeed was <,> was
released <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#192:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#193:1:B>
I now feel perhaps that was <{> <[> a mistake </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#194:1:A>
<[> A mistake </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#195:1:B>
Because <,> once <,> we did that we were on the slippery
slope <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#196:1:B>
And it has been said by others <,> are we not as good <,> as <,,>
that young lady <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#197:1:B>
Is it not the same blood <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#198:1:B>
Does the <,> more recent hostages not have parents <,> relatives
<,> friends

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#199:1:A>
Miss Akhtar what is <,> your solution <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#200:1:C>
My solution is that the government should take strong <,> uh
uh position <,> and should get co-operation from the opposition parties <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#201:1:C>
Mr Sahay the difficulty is <,,> that in Punjab <,> Mr Verghese
knows <,> though the news have not been appeared <,,> they are not so flashed
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#202:1:C>
But actually there are so many cases <,> in which the government
<}> <-> have </-> <+> has </+> </}> released criminals <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#203:1:A>
But <{> <[> gentleman </[> would it be a fair summing up <,,>
if we <,,> say that we agree <,,> that holding hostages is <,> one of the
most <,> criminal acts <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#204:1:C>
<[> And </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#205:1:B>
Absolutely

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#206:1:C>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#207:1:A>
We are agreed <,> that there is <,> uh a need for a national
consensus on this <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#208:1:C>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#209:1:B>
National and international

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#210:1:A>
And international <,,> and also we are agreed <,> that the
political parties should meet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#211:1:A>
Perhaps to that we may add <,,> that <,,> <w> it's </w> not enough
for political parties to meet <,> intellectuals <,> social workers <,> others

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#212:1:B>
The inter-state council <{> <[> so that state government
brought in </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#213:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#214:1:A>
Yes brought in <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#215:1:A>
But that it is not merely a government problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#216:1:A>
<w> It's </w> an emotional and human problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#217:1:B>
Absolutely

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#218:1:C>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#219:1:A>
And it has to be dealt with <,> at that level <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#220:1:C>
Hope so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#221:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#222:1:A>
Would you like to add something in <,> about a minute <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#223:1:C>
I think that uh <,,> your solution is correct <,> and uh we
must support it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#224:1:A>
George <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#225:1:C>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#226:1:B>
Well it is uh <,> not merely necessary to built that uh <,>
that <,> that consensus <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#227:1:B>
But also try and understand the psychology <,> at work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#228:1:B>
So that we can deal with it

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#229:1:B>
It is a form of psychological warfare

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#230:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#231:1:B>
So the nation has to be prepared to accept that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#232:1:B>
And public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters <{>
<[> and that needs </[> to be educated

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#233:1:A>
<[> Than </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#234:1:A>
We may perhaps end this discussion on the note <,> that we
<-> have </-> fervently hope and pray <,> that Doraswamy <,> or whoever else
<,> or whoever is held captive <,> probably is released <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#235:1:A>
And the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#236:1:B>
Naturally our hearts goes to <,> Mrs Doraswamy and family <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#237:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#238:1:B>
And to all others <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#239:1:B>
But this is a problem that we really must confess <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#240:1:C>
Significantly the Liberation Front has also appealed for his
release <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#241:1:A>
I hope <,,> I mean he gets released soon

<ICE-IND:S1B-024#242:1:A>
On this note gentleman I thank you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#243:1:C>
Thank you

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-024#244:1:B>
Thank you </I>
