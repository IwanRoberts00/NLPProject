actress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#31:1:A>
Personalities from <,,> various fields <,,> of Indian cinema <,>

of course acting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#32:1:A>
These are people who have gathered here <,,> from all parts <,> of
India <,,> representing <,> all the languages in which <,> Indian films are
made <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#33:1:A>
Regional Indian cinema has always played <,> a very important role
<,,> in the progress of Indian cinema <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#34:1:A>
And <,,> the best actor there <,,> waiting in anticipation <,,> for
the <w> V I P's </w> to arrive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#35:1:A>
The programme begins in just a few minutes <,,> from now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#36:1:A>
The cameraman with their shutter bags <,,> ready <,,> they are
waiting <,> for the moment to arrive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#37:1:A>
As we wait for the <w> V I P's </w> <,,> and there is <,,> the
evergreen hero Ashok Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#38:1:A>
A previous Dada Saheb Phalke award winner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#39:1:A>
And this year <,,> he is going to present <,> some of the awards
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#40:1:A>
We know Ashok Kumar as <,,> singer <,,> writer <,> and of course an
actor <,,> whose carrer has spanned several decades <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#41:1:A>
More decades than I could care to count <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#42:1:A>
Of late we see <,,> a lot of <,> crossing over of fields <,,> of
actor and actresses <,,> venturing into direction <,,> or the other way round
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#43:1:A>
One of the examples is right here in front of us on the screen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#44:1:A>
Neena Gupta who has won an award <,> for her first <,,> documentary
film <,,> on <,> <mention> Baja Sitaram </mention> <,,>

The award uh <,> function is being held here Vigyan Bhavan after

recently been renewed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#47:1:A>
For the film buffs of course <,> this is the time to <,,> come and
meet <,,> some of their favourite actors <,> and singers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#48:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#50:1:C>

Honarary Minister of Information and Broadcasting <indig> Shri

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#57:1:D>
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#58:1:D>
To honour the artists and technicians <,> who have <}> <-> <.> con
</.> </-> <=> contributed </=> </}> to cinematic excellence <,> during the
course of the year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#59:1:D>
Indian cinema has today <,> carved out a place for itself in
popular imagination <,> and convincingly left behind <,> all other forms of
entertainment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#60:1:D>
The credit for this <,,> goes to those innumerable artists <,> who
constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection <,,> while adhering to
the Indian spirit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#61:1:D>
Over the years <,,> as a number of films produced has gone up <,,>
so has the number of national awards confer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#62:1:D>
Three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen
fifty-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#63:1:D>
Today <,,> one hundred sixteen persons <,> involved in fifty-one
films will receive awards <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#64:1:D>
We do need to review regulations for these awards <,> and make
further improvement <,> to effectively encourage <,> the best in Indian
cinema <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#65:1:D>
Shall we take this opportunity <,> to greet all the award winners
who are assembled here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#66:1:D>
We take justifiable pride in their achievements <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#67:1:D>
And I earnestly hope that this recognition of their merit <,,> will
act as an incentive to them <,> to strive for greater excellence <,> in their
chosen disciplines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#68:1:D>
We have with us Shri K P Singh Deo honourable minister for
Information and Broadcasting <,> to grace the occassion with his presence

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#71:1:D>
We should be welcoming him in our midst <,> later this evening <,,>

for feature films <,> Mr Vikram Singh <,> who chair the jury <,> for
non-feature films <,> and <indig> Shri </indig> Khalid Mohammad <,> Chairman

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#75:1:D>
Thank you <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-017#76:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-017#77:1:E>
Good evening <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#78:1:E>
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr K P Singh
Deo <,> the Secretary Information and Broadcasting Ministry <,> Mr Bhaskar
Ghosh <,> Dadamuni <,,> Bhupenda <,> Jairaj Saab <,> Chairman of jury <,> and
distinguished guest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#79:1:E>
Perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received <,>
for the best popular cinema <,> and this film criticism <,> where by large
<,> mediocre <,> and substandard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#80:1:E>
On a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting
exercise <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#81:1:E>
To plough through the entries and separate <,> the wheat from the
chaff <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#82:1:E>
A handfull of the books and articles indicate us <,> that there is
hope yet <,> for analytical <,> and insightful writing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#83:1:E>
The award wining book <mention> Nalu Nenu </mention> <,> by the
veteran actress Dr Bhanumati Ramakrishna <,> underscores the point that we
need more candid <,,> and informative autobiographies from film personalities
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#84:1:E>
I need to hardly remind you <,> that biographical accounts <,>
written in West <,> have been important adjuncts <,> to the process of film
making <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#85:1:E>
For instance <,> many of us have cherished the life stories <,>
authored by the greats of cinema <,> ranging from memorable biography <,> of
Charlie Chaplin <,> <mention> To the flashback on the life and career
</mention> by Vanessa Redgrave <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#86:1:E>
Curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen
to paper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#87:1:E>
It would indeed be wonderful <,> if directors technicians <,,> and
the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst <,> with the art and
craft of film making <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#88:1:E>
At this point I must regret the tendency of most Indian publishers
to capitalise on the deaths of film personality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#89:1:E>
Whether it was the legendary Meena Kumari or the grand showman <,>
Raj Kapoor <,> scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own
lifetime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#90:1:E>
In addition a note of caution has to be struck <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#91:1:E>
The year nineteen ninety-five <,> will be celebrated as the
centenary of cinema <,> the world over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#92:1:E>
If the event becomes an excuse for sketchy <,> and quickly
assembled books on cinema <,> it would indeed be a pity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#93:1:E>
Both research and reflection are essential <,> before any major
endeavour in film writing is undertaken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#94:1:E>
To come now to film criticism <,,> on the whole the entries in this
section displays a thorough lack of humour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#95:1:E>
Most of the reviews and the report submitted <,> were weighed down
<,> by excessive verbiage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#96:1:E>
Without adding anymore verbiage of my own <,> let me conclude with
a small request <,> to the authorities <,,> from me and my colleagues on the
panel <,> Miss Vasudev and Miss Uday Tara Nair <,> could the cash prize in
the categories of the best book on cinema <,> and best film criticism be
increased from the current amount of <indig> rupees </indig> fifteen thousand
each <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#97:1:E>
Dare we say to <indig> rupees </indig> twenty-five thousand each
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#98:1:E>
That would be an extra incentive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#99:1:E>
Here is ending then <,> on the note of optimism <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#100:1:E>
Thank you <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-017#101:1:C>
Thank you very much Khalid for presenting your comments <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#102:1:C>
I now like to invite the Chairman of the non- feature film jury
<,> <indig> Shri </indig> K Vikram Singh to present his address <,,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-017#103:1:F>
Good evening <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#104:1:F>
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting <,,> <indig>
Shri </indig> Singh Deo <,> Secretary Information <}> <-> <.> Broad </.> </->
<=> Broadcasting </=> </}> <indig> Shri </indig> Bhaskar Ghosh <,> fellow
film makers <,> ladies and gentleman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#105:1:F>
It has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non-
feature film jury <,> to see and select films <,,> for the non-feature film
awards <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#106:1:F>
I am happy with report <,,> that the documentary film in India is
in a state of good health <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#107:1:F>
And the short drama film <,> is also picking up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#108:1:F>
This is despite the fact <,,> that the number of entries in the
non-feature category <,> has declined from one fifty nineteen eighty-five <,>
to only sixty-eight this year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#109:1:F>
This decline <,,> I think is mainly on account of the fact <,,>
that is lot of non-fiction work <,> has shifted from the film format <,> to
the video format <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#110:1:F>
This body of work on video format <,> is still going largely
unrecognised <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#111:1:F>
This jury has therefore <,,> separately recommended <,> that
documentaries and short films on the video format <,> should be brought
within the fold of the national awards <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#112:1:F>
How that can be done <,,> is left to an expert committee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#113:1:F>
But there is one field of documentary film <,> which is facing
imminent death <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#114:1:F>
This is the yarn of political documentary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#115:1:F>
There were very few political documentaries <,> in this years
entry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#116:1:F>
It is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this <O> one
word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#117:1:F>
Perhaps the real reason is <,,> that the culture of respecting
dissent <,> is fast disappearing from our social political life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#118:1:F>
And therefore <,> the social funding political films <,> have died
out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#119:1:F>
If different and even clashing views <,> are not battled and
sorted out on the floors of legislative body <,> and in the media <,> they
are bound to violently overflow <,> on the streets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#120:1:F>
There is an urgent need therefore <,> for creating a framework <,>
on our statefunded television <,> that is <indig> doordarshan </indig> <,>
within which voices of dissent <,> can be responsibly expressed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#121:1:F>
I would urge the government <,> as a research step <,> <indig>
doordarshan </indig> should air off a weakly slot which may be called the
other vaults <,> the other views

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#122:1:F>
In this research oriented documentaries of the political nature
<,> should be shown <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#123:1:F>
These should be funded by <indig> doordarshan </indig> <,> but the
overall <?> thing </?> is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a
non-political body <,> <}> <-> of <.> indepen </.> </-> <=> of independent
</=> </}> intellectual <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#124:1:F>
National film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#125:1:F>
A beginning was made several years ago <,> to name an award <,>
after Dada Saheb Phalke <,> and another award <,> after Nargis Dutt <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#126:1:F>
It is time we took another step in this direction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#127:1:F>
I suggest <,> that the government should name the awards for the
best film <,> on social issues <,> in the non-feature category after S <?>
Suth </?> Ray who still remain <,> inadequately recognised <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-017#128:1:F>
I would also suggest that the government should name the best
feature films award <,> after Satyajit Ray <,> who is without question the
greatest film writer <,> and one of the finest mind <,> that India has
produced in this century <,,> </I>
