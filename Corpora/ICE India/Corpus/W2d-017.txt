<ICE-IND:W2D-017#3:1>
NEARLY seven million hectares of land is salt-affected and lying
uncultivated, although the soils are potentially productive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#4:1>
The saline soils are found mainly in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#5:1>
The alkali soils are predominent in the Indo-Gangetic plains,
encompassing the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Bihar and
Rajasthan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#6:1>
Isolated patches of alkali soils also occur in some parts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#7:1>
With the advent of canal irrigation, salinity and alkalinity are
extending to large areas of fertile cultivable lands. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#8:1>
<h> <bold> HOW SALT-AFFECTED SOILS ARE FORMED? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#9:1>
Salt-affected soils are formed whenever soil and hydrological
conditions favour the accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone of
soils, even though temporarily.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#10:1>
Salt-affected soils generally do not occur extensively in the humid
areas.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#11:1>
This is because the salts get continuously leached out of the soil
root zone by the leaching action of rain water.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#12:1>
Leached salts are transported to other areas through surface and
subsurface flows, the areas of discharge depending on the geohydrological,
soil and climatic features.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#13:1>
Salt-affected soils are of common occurence in the semi-arid and arid
regions which receive an inadequate rainfall to accomplish leaching of salts
originally present in the soil profile. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#14:1>
The saline / alkaline soils are developed by any one or more of
several means, as follows: </p> <*> small circle to left </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#15:1>
In arid regions, where there is low rainfall and high
temperature, there is always a tendency for the accumulation of soluble salts
near the surface due to intense evaporation and less percolation. </p> <*>
small circle to left </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#16:1>
The ground water of arid regions usually contains considerable
quantities of soluble salts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#17:1>
If it is used for irrigaiton it spoils the good soils.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#18:1>
The extent of damage depends not only upon the salt content of
irrigation water but also on the nature of salts and type of soils on which
the water is to be used.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#19:1>
The sodium salts are more harmful than Ca and Mg and amongst them,
NaCl is the worst culprit. </p> <*> small circle to left </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#20:1>
Sometimes the salts may have originated directly from chemical
weathering of rocks and deposited on good soils. </p> <*> small circle to
left </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#21:1>
When excessive applications of irrigation water have raised the
ground water level sufficiently to permit concentration of salts from saline
ground water at the surface by capillary action through intense evaporation,
it leaves ever-increasing salts at the surface. </p> <*> small circle to left
</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#22:1>
When seepage from leaky canals and lateral channels, which run at
a higher level, has resulted in a high water table, formation of
saline/alkali soils takes places. </p> <*> small circle to left </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#23:1>
Poor drainage keeps the salts in the surface soil and prevents
the leaching of salts down below the root zone. </p> <*> small circle to left
</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#24:1>
When the use of irrigation water is erratic, that is flooding at
one time followed by intense drying and long breaks.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#25:1>
When the total supply of water is limited and irregular this would
also leave the salts in the root zone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#26:1>
Salt-affected soils occur in all continents, but they are very
unevenly distributed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#27:1>
They occur most extensively in the arid and semi-arid, and in
subhumid regions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#28:1>
They may also occur in the humid regions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#29:1>
According to FAO study, salt-affected soils occupy nearly seven
per cent of the <w> World's </w> land area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#30:1>
The latest survey indicates that salt affected area has increased
to about 10 million ha.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#31:1>
It is also feared that several <O> <&> page </&> 6 </O> million ha.
of productive land in the newly irrigated areas will soon deteriorate if
preventive steps are not taken. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#33:1>
<h> <bold> Saline soils: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#34:1>
The saline soils have excessive concentration of natural soluble
salts mainly of chlorides, sulphates and carbonates of calcium, magnesium and
sodium.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#35:1>
The electric conductivity of saturated soil extract at 25<sp>o</sp>C
is more than 4 mm hos/cm, exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 per
cent and pH less than 8.5.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#36:1>
Saline soils are in flocculated condition and consequently have
satisfactory physical characterists.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#37:1>
They are also called <quote> " white alkali" </quote> or <quote> "
solonchak" </quote> soils. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#38:1>
The best way of diagnosis is to collect ( 0.15 cm) composite soil

However, some of the visual characteristics, by which one can
diagnose the affected soils in the field itself, are given below: </p> <*>

are left as a crust when the water evaporates. </p> <*> small circle to left

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#44:1>
In areas having relatively more moist conditions the prominent
growth of plants like Sueda species is observed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#45:1>
<h> <bold> Alkali soils: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#46:1>
In these soils the percentage of exchangeable sodium content is
greater than 15 per cent as a result the pH is between 8.5 and 10.0.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#47:1>
The electric conductivity is below 4 mm hos/cm at 25<sp>o</sp>C.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#48:1>
Because of the high sodium content, both the clay and organic matter
are dispersed, and the result is close packing of the soil particles and
reduced pore space and aeration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#49:1>
The poor aeration and high sodium content, which is often toxic, make
alkali soils difficult and expensive to reclaim.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#50:1>
Under field conditions the following symptoms will be seen: </p> <O>

Practically no crops can stand satisfactorily and land gives a

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#58:1>
<h> <bold> Saline alkali soil: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#59:1>
These are both saline and alkali in various stages of transition
having electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract more than 5 mmhos/cm
at 25<sp>o</sp>C, exchangeable sodium in excess of 15 per cent and pH above
8.5 depending upon the relative amounts of exchangeable sodium and soluble
salts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#60:1>
When soluble salts are leached downward, the pH will rise above 8.5,
but when the soluble salts again accumulate the pH may again fall to 8.5.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#61:1>
There may not be salt deposits on the surface.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#62:1>
However, the hard clay pan in the lower layer obstructs the drainage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#63:1>
There may be a lime pan at lower depths.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#64:1>
They usually suffer from water-logging. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#65:1>
<h> <bold> HARMFUL EFFECTS ON GROWING PLANTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#66:1>
The saline soils do not support plant growth primarily because of
excessive salts in the soil solution which, due to high osmotic pressure,
prevents absorption of moisture and nutrients in adequate amounts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#67:1>
Thus, in saline soils the wilting co-efficient is high and the amount
of available moisture is low.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#68:1>
An excess of sodium ions also exert antagonistic effect on the
absorption of calcium and magnesium.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#69:1>
Under alkali soil conditions, the damage is not due to salt
concentration, since the conductivity of the soil solution is low.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#70:1>
The sodium absorbed by soil clay and organic colloids causes
dispersion of clay which results in a loss of desirable structure and the
development of puddied effect.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#71:1>
Such effect on physical properties reduce drainage, aeration and
microbial activity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#72:1>
Under saline-alkali conditions, the crop may suffer due to high
salinity as well as due to unfavourable effects of alkalinity on the nutrient
availability </p>

<h> <bold> RECLAMATION OF SALT-AFFECTED SOILS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#74:1>
<h> <bold> Alkali soils </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#75:1>
Basically reclamation or improvement of alkali soils requires the
removal of a part or most of the exchangeable sodium and its replacement by
the more favourable calcium ions in the root zone.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#76:1>
This can be accomplished in many ways, the best dictated by local
conditions available, rotation of the crops to be grown and reclamation of
the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#77:1>
Levelling and bunding of salt-affected fields are major components of
their reclamation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#78:1>
<h> <bold> Amendments </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#79:1>
The alkali soils in the Indo-Gangetic plains are mostly calcarious.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#80:1>
Therefore, there is a wider choice of amendments like calcium sources
or acid.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#81:1>
Calcium carrying amendments include gypsum and phosphogypsum which
are very commonly used as direct source of calcium to replace exchangeable
sodium. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#82:1>
In India, as in many countries, gypsum/pyrite is the most widely
used amendment for alkali soil reclamation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#83:1>
Soil Na+ + CaSo4 - Soil Ca++ + Na2 So4 Na+ ( Leached)

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#84:1>
Many other amendments, e.g., sulphuric acid, calcium chloride can
also be used and are as much or even slightly more effective than gypsum, but
these materials are generally expensive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#85:1>
Quantity of an amendment needed for alkali soil reclamation
depends upon the amount of exchangeable sodium that has to <O> <&> page </&>
8 </O> be replaced.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#86:1>
These depends both on the amount of sodium absorbed into the soil and
the alkali tolerants, including the rooting depth of the crops to be grown.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#87:1>
<h> <bold>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#88:1>
HOW THE AMENDMENTS REACT AND BRING THE SOIL TO NORMAL CONDITIONS?
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#89:1>
<h> <bold> Gypsum </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#90:1>
The gypsum converts sodium soil into calcium soil by cationic
exchange, with a desirable lowering of pH and an improvement in soil physical
conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#91:1>
The gypsum powder to be applied should be of 30 mesh fineness and be
mixed in top 10 cm soil with the help of a disc or M.B. plough.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#92:1>
The reactions involved in the soil are: 2Na - clay+CaSo4 = Ca - clay
+ Na2 So4 ( Leached out) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#93:1>
<h> <bold> Sulphur </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#94:1>
In extreme cases of high alkalinity, the reduction in pH can be
brought about by the use of sulphuric acid.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#95:1>
However, it requires expert handling and is quite expensive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#96:1>
The sulphur added to the soil is oxidized to sulphuric acid with the
help of microbiological oxidation which converts calcium carbonate to calcium
sulphate and Ca<sp>++</sp> replaces Na<sp>+</sp> in the clay complex. </p> 2S
+ 30<sb>2</sb> = 2 So3 So3 + H2o = H2So4 H2So4 + Caco3 = CaSo4 + Co2 + H2O 2
Na - clay + CaSo4 + Ca - clay + Na2So4 ( Leached out)

<p> <bold> Organic matter </bold> :

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#97:1>
The addition of organic matter ( FYM / green manure ) helps in
lowering the pH, improving the soil structure and availability of nitrogen to
the crops.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#98:1>
The organic matter is especially helpful where sulphur is added to
correct the alkalinity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#99:1>
Since the organic matter supplies food for the sulphur oxidising
bacteria and enhances the oxidation of sulphur to sulphuric acid, the
combination fo sulphur, organic manure and gypsum can also be used with
success. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#100:1>
<h> <bold> Iron sulphate </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#101:1>
Iron sulphate is sometimes used as a chemical amendment, which forms
sulphuric acid on additon to soil.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#102:1>
The sulphuric acid reacts with native and / or added calcium
carbonate and form CaSO<sb>4</sb> which replaces Na in the clay complex: </p>
FeSo4 + H2O = H2So4 + Feo H2So4 + Caco3 = Caso4 + H2o + Co2 2 Na-Clay + CaSo4
= Ca-clay + Na2So4 ( Leached out)

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#103:1>
<h> <bold> Molasses, pressmud and basic slag : </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#104:1>
The use of molasses alongwith pressmud and basic slag is also found
good.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#105:1>
The molasses provide the source of energy for micro-organisms which
on fermentation produce organic acids.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#106:1>
The organic acids reduce alkalinity and increase the availability of
phosphate.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#107:1>
The addition of pressmud, which contains calcium, produces soluble
calcium salts that help in reducing exchangeable sodium.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#108:1>
Under conditions of a good supply of available phosphate in the form
of basic slag, the nitrogen fixation is also benefited. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#109:1>
<h> <bold> Choice of crops </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#110:1>
Growing crops tolerant to excess exchangeable sodium can ensure
reasonable returns during initial phases of reclamation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#111:1>
Rice is favoured as the first crop, because it can tolerate standing
water and medium levels of ESP and exerts reclamative effect on the soil
through root respiration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#112:1>
With the judicious management, properly amended alkali soils can
produce three to four tonnes of paddy per hectare in the very first year,
besides, introducing favourable changes in the physico-chemical soil
properties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#113:1>
Crop production in salt-affected soils demands managerial skills
of a higher order turned to the physico-chemical status of the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#114:1>
Apart from judicious fertilisation, other agronomic practices that
demand specific treatment include seed-bed preparation,
seeding/transplanting, weeding, irrigation, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#115:1>
The organic matter content of the alkali soils is often very
low.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#116:1>
Organic manures including farmyard manures, <O> <&> page </&> 9 </O>
compost and green manures have an important place in reclamation of alkali
soils. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#117:1>
Grasses are, in general, more tolerant of alkali conditions than
most field crops.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#118:1>
All these can be grown successfully in strongly alkali soils.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#119:1>
Grasses also improve the soils so that after a few years other field
crops could be taken. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#120:1>
<h> <bold> Saline Soils </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#121:1>
Reclamation of saline soils involves leaching of excess soluble
soils from the root zone, lowering of water table below the critical depth,
selection of suitable crops and their varieties and adoption of agronomic
practices conforming to the need for keeping root environment safe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#122:1>
Removing the salts that have accumulated on the soil surface by
the mechanical means has had a limited success although many farmers resort
to this procedure.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#123:1>
Although scraping of salts might temporarily improve crop growth,
the ultimate disposal of salts still poses a major problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#124:1>
Washing away the surface accumulation of salts by flushing water
over the surface is sometimes to desalinize soils having surface salt crust.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#125:1>
This method is not very sound from a practical standpoint because
the amount of salt that can be flushed off the soil is rather small. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#126:1>
Leaching involves removing excess salts to reduce root zone
salinity to a desired level.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#127:1>
The efficiency with which salts can be leached per unit of applied
water depends upon factors like soil type, characteristics of soil profile,
depth of applied water, method of application, absorption and exchange
reactions during leaching and the initial wetness of the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#128:1>
The amount of salts removed depends entirely on the quantity of
water that passes through the soil and depends upon the quality of water used
for leaching.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#129:1>
Leaching is effective only if the drainage facilities are adequate.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#130:1>
Surface drainage provides an efficient means for lowering water
table and to prevent secondary salinization.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#131:1>
In addition to the initial cost of installing a drainage system,
problems of disposal of drainage waters could assume serious proportions in
areas where no natural outlet like sea is available.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#132:1>
This problem can be solved to some extent by ( i) minimising
leaching of this volume of drainage water, ( ii) disposal of saline drainage
water by evaporation in salt pans, collecting drain water in selected areas,
( iii) using stored drainage waters for brackish water fishculture, and ( iv)
reuse of such waters with good quality waters for irrigation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-017#133:1>
Salt-affected soils may also contain those salts which are very
toxic to plants even at low concentrations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#134:1>
Some salts are not as readily leached out or eliminated as others.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#135:1>
Such peculiar situation must be dealt with after diagnosing the
problem.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#136:1>
Good post-reclamation management of once salt-affected soils leached
extremely is important because soil degradation process can again start under
poor soil and crop management.

<ICE-IND:W2D-017#137:1>
A close monitoring of soil health to sustain productivity level of
reclaimed land is necessary. </p> <footnote> <sp> * </sp>
