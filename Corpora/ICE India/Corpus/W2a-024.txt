<h> <bold> 1 Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#7:1>
Since the advent of solid state nuclear track detectors (
SSNTDs ) in the late 1950s, and the discovery in the next decade that
plastics can record nuclear tracks <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> , there has been
rapid progress in the application of these detectors in various
disciplines.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#8:1>
The tailored plastic CR-39 made its mark in the 1970s as an efficient
detector even for low-energy light particles <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#9:1>
The remarkable discovery of Tarle <it> et al </it> . <fnr> <sp> 3
</sp> </fnr> that the addition of about 1 % DOP ( dioctyl phthalate ) to
CR-39 monomer greatly improves its optical quality and surface smoothness
even after prolonged etching, made CR-39 ( DOP ) detectors widely used
in different areas.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#10:1>
Since then many new plastics and their variations have been tried
for the suitability of recording nuclear tracks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#11:1>
Recently, a Japanese group <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> has
discovered that a variation of CR-39 monomer with suitable additives is
very sensitive to low energy nuclear particles and that the sensitivity is
as large as three times that of CR-39 ( DOP ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#12:1>
This latter variety, which is not yet commercially released, goes
under the code names SR-86 ( 10 ) , SR-86 ( 20 ) , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#13:1>
There are also slight differences in the physical behaviour of CR-39
( DOP ) detectors manufactured by different companies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#14:1>
Having studied these differences in some of these detectors, we
decided to undertake a systematic study of etch track formation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#15:1>
We present our results on CR-39 ( DOP ) ( manufactured by Pershore
Moulding Ltd., U.K. ) , MA-ND/a ( made by ATOMKI, De-brecen, Hungary ) ,
SR-86 ( 20 ) , and cellulose nitrate plastic detector, CN-85 ( manufactured
by Kodak Pathe ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#16:1>
The MA-ND/a is a new type of CR-39 track detector ( allyl
diglycol carbonate ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#17:1>
Etch track formation related calculations have revealed its high
sensitivity to alpha particles <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#18:1>
And SR-86, which is another new type of polymeric track
detector as reported by FUjii <it> et al</it>. <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> ,
has been obtained by introducing sulphonate groups to thermosetting resins
with three-dimensional network structure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#19:1>
We have used SR-86 ( 20 ) in this present piece of work, which is a
test sample of copolymer of CR-39 with 20 % of diethylene glycol bis ( allyl
sulphonate ) , i.e. DEAS.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#20:1>
The details about this detector can be obtained from Ref. 4. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#21:1>
In order to have a comparative study, we have included CN-85 (
KODAK ) cellulose nitrate plastic track detector, which has been in use since
a long time.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#22:1>
It is a clear and transparent film of cellulose nitrate containing a
small amount of camphor, which serves as a plasticizer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#23:1>
This platicizer is neither attacked nor soluble in etchants (
which in our case is 6.25 N NaOH ) <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#24:1>
<h> <bold> 2 Experimental Details </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#25:1>
In irradiating the detector foils and thereafter etching these
samples chemically to make them ready for scanning under an optical
microscope, there are so many factors affecting these processes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#26:1>
Parameters such as etching time, etch temperature, concentration of
the etchant to name a few, are very important.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#27:1>
We propose to establish and standardize relationships between these
parameters which will be very useful in th etching laboratories.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#28:1>
As a first step, two parameters, etching time ( <it> <mention> t
</mention> </it> ) and etch temperature ( <it> <mention> T </mention>
</it> ) have been chosen and attempts are made to establish a relationship
for all the four types of detectors mentioned above, which are widely used as
nuclear particle detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#29:1>
For this the effect of these two parameters on these detectors have
been studied separately, and then the relationships have been established.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#30:1>
The work is divided into three parts; the first part <O> <&> page
</&> 108 </O> being the study of track diameter versus etching time
characteristics, the second one being the track diameter versus etch
temperature studies, and the final part dealing with the results obtained
and their verification.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#31:1>
For irradiating the detector foils a mixed source of <w> a's </w> (
Am, Cm, Pu ) of energy around 5 MeV ( 5.49, 5.80 and 5.16 MeV ) has been
used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#32:1>
In the histograms of frequency versus diameters of the etched
tracks in CR-39 ( DOP ) [ Fig.1 ] one can clearly see the three peaks
corresponding to the major energy groiups of the alpha particles in the
mixed source.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#33:1>
Thus it is advantageous to use the mixed source instead of a
monoenergetic source. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#34:1>
<h> <bold> 3 Results and Discussion </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#35:1>
<h> <bold> 3.1 Diameter ( <it> <mention> D </mention> </it> ) versus
etching time ( <it> <mention> t </mention> </it> ) characteristics </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#36:1>
Detector foils were irradiated with collimated alpha particles at
normal incidence from the above source for 6 hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#37:1>
The etchant used in etching these samples was 6.25 N NaOH aqueous
solution, all other parameters affecting the etching ( except etch
temperature which was different for different detectors being the same as
reported earlier <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#38:1>
The irradiated samples of CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND a were etched at
70<*>degree</*>C for 3 hr. of SR-86 ( 20 ) at 70<*>degree</*>C for 20 min;
and of CN-85 ( KODAK ) at 50<*>degree</*>C for 2 hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#39:1>
After drying, the samples were scanned separately under a Leitz
optical microscope fitted with a filar micrometer eyepiece of 450 x
magnification.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#40:1>
For finding out the most probable diameter, the surface diameters
of about 300 tracks have been measured to study the diameter distribution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#41:1>
The class interval chosen for grouping the diameters measured to
obtain histograms was 0.2 um. </p> <O> histogram </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#42:1>
Then the samples were successively etched for different times
separately, i.e. the etching time varied in steps without changing the
etch temperature; and at each step, after scanning most probable diameters
were found out.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#43:1>
Typical histograms for various etching times are shown in Fig. 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#44:1>
The nature of variation of track diameters with etching time is shown
in Figs 2 and 3 for all the detectors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#45:1>
Bohus and Greaves <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> have shown that in
the case of CR-39 ( DOP ) detectors, the variation of track diameter with
etching time is non-linear for etching time below 40 min and above this
critical etching time and up to 80 min a simple linear relation could fit the
data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#46:1>
In our studies we have etched the CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a
detectors from 3 hr onwards and it is observed that the variation is
linear in the whole range of etching time considered for CR-39 ( DOP )
detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#47:1>
But the data for MA-ND/a could not be fitted with a single straight
line.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#48:1>
From t = 3 to 6 hr the variation is linear, and after 6 hr of etching
this variation is still linear but with considerable increase in the
slope.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#49:1>
In case of CN-85 ( KODAK ) detectors, this variation deviates from
linearity after 4.5 hr of etching.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#50:1>
But we could not proceed further to see if it behaved in the same
manner like MA-ND/a, because after prolonged etching, the surface
smoothness and the optical qualities deteriorated to such an extent that the
measurement of diameter of etchpits was not accurate enough to extract any
information definitely.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#51:1>
In case of SR-86 ( 20 ) the variation of track diameter with
etching time is linear up to an etching time <it> <mention> t </mention>
</it> = 60 min <O> graph </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 109 </O> (
slope = 0.16 <*> mu</*>m/min ) and it still possesses this behaviour up to
100 min but with a fair increase in the slope.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#52:1>
The nature of this variation is similar to that shown by Fujii <fnr>
<sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> and is shown in Fig. 3.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#53:1>
Etching conditions in Ref. [ 9 ] were 7N NaOH aqueous solution at
70<*>degree</*>C. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#54:1>
The slopes of linear portions of the curves for all the detectors
have been calculated which are listed in Table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#55:1>
The straight lines in each case are computer <O> graph </O> <O> caption
</O>  best fits ( i.e. least square analysis has been done for each
curve ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#56:1>
<h> <bold> 3.2 Diameter versus etch temperature characteristics
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#57:1>
The existence of the effect of etch temperature on response of
CR-39 detector has been definitely established <fnr> <sp> 10 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#58:1>
Somogyi has carried out simulation experiments with electron
irradiated CR-39 foils, choosing both the electron dose and etch
temperature as the varying parameters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#59:1>
The results thereafter show the response to be much more sensitive
to changes in high damage densities <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#60:1>
Our attempt is to study the effect of change in etch temperature
using all the four types of detectors mentioned earlier.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#61:1>
Keeping the concentration of the etchant and all other parameters
affecting etching constant, the temperature is varied in steps, etching a
new, freshly irradiated sample of each detector every time separately for
a fixed time, which is different for different detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#62:1>
The etching time for CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a is 3 hr. for SR-86
( 20 ) it is 30 min and for CN-85 KODAK it is 2 hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#63:1>
After scanning the samples, the arithmetic mean value of track
diameters ( <it> <mention> D </mention> </it> ) were plotted against etch
temperature ( <it> <mention> T </mention> </it> ) as shown in Figs 4-6.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#64:1>
It is well-known that track diameters of charged particles grow
non-linearly with the etch temperature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#65:1>
The bulk etch rate obeys the Arrhenius relation <mention>
V<sb>B</sb> ( T ) = V<sb>o</sb>exp ( - - Q/kT </h> </mention> where <mention>
V<sb>o</sb> </mention> and <mention> k </mention> are constants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#66:1>
<mention> Q </mention> is the activation energy for the bulk
etching and <mention> T </mention> is the etch temperature in degree
Kelvin.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#67:1>
For a normally incident particle, <O> Table 1. </O> <O> caption </O> <O>
<&> page </&> 110 </O> <O> graph </O> <O> caption </O>   the diameter
<mention> D </mention> = <mention> 2V<sb>B</sb>t </mention> ( where <mention>
t </mention> is a constant ) is not a linear function of the etch temperature
<fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#68:1>
Our data have been fitted with the above relation and the fits are
shown in Fig. 3 for CR-39 ( DOP ) , MA-ND/a and CN-85 ( KODAK ) detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#69:1>
These exponential curves have been broken into two linear parts for
all the detectors ( except SR-86 ( 20 ) ) and these are shown in Fig.4 ( our
aim is to calculate the slopes in these two regions and relate them with
their respective ( dD/dt ) <sb> T</sb> slopes ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#70:1>
In the case of CR-39 ( DOP ) , the slope ( dD/dT ) ? , increases
remarkably after 75<*>degree</*>C ( from 0.468 <*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C to
1.6 <*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C ) and this is also the trend in case of
MA-ND/a, where the slopes below and above 75<*>degree</*>C are 0.372 and 1.44
<*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#71:1>
When the etch temperature is raised beyond 80<*>degree</*>C, the
CR-39 ( DOP ) foils start losing their transparency and the surface
becomes rough; but MA-ND/a foils are still beautifully smooth and
transparent, which suggests that one can go above 80<*>degree</*>C without
causing much damage to the detector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#72:1>
But we could not go beyond 82.5<*>degree</*>C, because of the
limitations in our temperature bath. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#73:1>
However SR-86 ( 20 ) is a bit different from others in this
respect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#74:1>
The <it> <mention> D </mention> </it> versus <it> <mention> T
</mention> </it> variation in the range 60<*>degree</*>C <*> equal to or
greater than</*> <it> <mention> T </mention> </mention> </it> <*> equal to or
greater than</*> </*> 73<*>degree</*>C is linear with a slope of 0.36 <*>
mu</*>m/ <*> degree</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#75:1>
In an attempt to see if it behaves in a manner similar to the
above two detectors, it was observed that as we went above
77.5<*>degree</*>C, the detector foils started losing their optical
properties and perceptible damage to the detector occurred.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#76:1>
At 80<*>degree</*>C it was badly damaged and the surfaces became
irregular and the diameter of tracks were no longer circular.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#77:1>
At 82.5<*>degree</*>C this irregularity was the worst and the detector <O>
graph </O> <O> caption </O> was totally damaged.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#78:1>
However, in the region where it possesses linearity in D versus T
variation, the detector foils exhibit remarkable optical clarity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#79:1>
It is observed that this detector can be successfully used below
77.5<*>degree</*>C. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#80:1>
CN-85 ( KODAK ) behaved in a manner similar to CR-39 ( DOP ) and
MA-ND/a in its response to changes in etch temperature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#81:1>
The D versus T variation <O> <&> page </&> 111 </O> is
exponential in nature ( Fig.3 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#82:1>
As stated in the case of CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a, its slopes in the
two regions below and above 52.5<*>degree</*>C are 0.566 and 0.8 <*>
mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#83:1>
This could be studied up to 60<*>degree</*>C, because at higher
temperatures the detector foils became rough and lost their optical
properties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#84:1>
Thus it is observed that each of these detectors exhibits a
certain type of behaviour up to a critical etch temperature, say T<sb>e</sb>,
which is a characteristic of the detector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#85:1>
And at temperatures above T<sb>e</sb>, certain changes may be
occurring in the material that its behaviour changes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#86:1>
This temperature has been mentioned as critical, just to show that
the behaviour of the detectors changes notably and the trend of variation
of track diameter with etch temperature starts to change sharply above this
temperature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#87:1>
This T<sb>e</sb> for all the detectors are listed in Table 1. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#88:1>
Thus it is clear that only Ma-ND a is the highest temperature
resistant among the four types of detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#89:1>
However, SR-86 ( 20 ) is the best of all, as long as it does not get
damaged.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#90:1>
Its sensitivity to the variation of these two etch parameters is
remarkable. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#91:1>
<h> <bold> 3.3 Relationships and their verification </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#92:1>
The relationship between etching time <it> <mention> t </mention>
</it> and etch temperature ( <it> <mention> T </mention> </it> ) has been
obtained as follows: <O> equation </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#93:1>
The negative sign indicates that <it> <mention> t </mention> </it>
decreases with increasing <it> <mention> T </mention> </it> and vice versa
for constant <it> <mention> D </mention> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#94:1>
Hence to keep the diameter constant, if we increase the etch
temperature the etching time should be proportionately decreased and vice
versa, in accordance with the above relation while keeping all other factors
affecting etching such as concentration of the etchant, etc., unchanged.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#95:1>
From the nature of variation of track diameter with etch
temperature for all the four detectors, it is seen that the variation is
exponential in the range of etch temperature considered for each detector (
Fig. 4 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#96:1>
As can be done with any exponential curve for such nature, each curve
has been broken into two linear parts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#97:1>
The slopes of these two linear regions have been related with their
respective dD/dt ) <sb> T</sb> slopes and the relationship between etching
time and etch temperature has been derived and attempted for verification.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-024#98:1>
Let us first consider CR-39 ( DOP ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#99:1>
The <it> <mention> D </mention> </it> versus <it> <mention> t
</mention> </it> variation is linear in the whole range of etching time
considered.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#100:1>
Its slope is 2.6 <*> mu</*>m/hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#101:1>
The slope dD dT ) , up to 75<*>degree</*>C is 0.468 <*>
mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#102:1>
In accordance with the relation mentioned above, ( dt/dT ) <sb>
D</sb>= - 10.8 min/<*>degree</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#103:1>
The most probable diameter obtained after three hours of etching at
70<*>degree</*>C is taken as the reference point ( D=5.8 <*> mu</*>m ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#104:1>
After irradiating a fresh sample of the above detector for 6 hr, it
was etched at 75<*>degree</*>C for [ 3 hr - - ( 5 x 10.8 ) min ] 2 hr 06 min
( since ( dt/dT ) <sb> n</sb> for this detector is - 10.8 min/<*>degree</*>C
in the temperature range 65<*>degree</*>C <*> left arrow</*> <it> <mention> T
</mention> </it> <*> left arrow</*> 75<*>degree</*>C, see Table 1 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#105:1>
Scanning under the optical microscope yielded the most probable
diameter to be 5.8 ( <*> plus or minus</*> 0.2 ) <*> mu</*>m.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#106:1>
which is well within the experimental error.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#107:1>
Another freshly irradiated sample was etched again at
65<*>degree</*>C for 3 hr 54 min; and after scanning the most probable
diameter was found to be 5.8 ( <*> plus or minus</*>0.2 ) <*> mu</*>m.

<ICE-IND:W2A-024#108:1>
In the same fashion the relations for SR-86 ( 20 ) and for CN-85
( KODAK ) were verified in the temperature range mentioned against each of
them in Table 1. </p> </I>
