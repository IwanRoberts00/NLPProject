<ICE-IND:W2B-013#4:1>
<bold> One </bold> cannot help being tentative while commenting on
the provisional results of a census.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#5:1>
One must await the results of the <it> final </it> count for any
degree of confidence in making comments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#6:1>
Invariably, the final figures are <it> higher </it> though marginally,
than the provisional figures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#7:1>
While interpreting the results of a population census, one must
observe certain ground rules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#8:1>
To my mind, the first such rule concerns <it> comparability </it> of
data at two points of time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#9:1>
It may be recalled that there was no consensus enumeration in Assam in
1981 because of disturbed conditions whereas the 1991 census enumeration has
yet to take place in Jammu & Kashmir.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#10:1>
The 1981 census figure for India includes the projected population of
Assam while the 1991 census figure for India included the projected
population of Jammu & Kashmir.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#11:1>
The statistical implications of the exclusion of some states from
census enumeration and the inclusion of the projected figure for some other
states while comparing the results of two census ( say, 1981 and 1991) have
to be worked out before one can comment with confidence on the decadal growth
rate of population. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#12:1>
I believe that the 1991 census enumeration was, on the whole, a
fairly good enumeration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#13:1>
Nevertheless, I would argue that the net undercount at the 1991
census would have been at least double that of the 1981 rate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#14:1>
There are at least two reasons for this ( I) during 1981-91 there
has been rapid urbanisation and this tends to increase the coverage error of
the census ( i.e., the total count) and ( 2) the general boom in consumerism
and the increasing dissatisfaction on the part of the vast army of 1.7
million enumerators with the paltry honorarium given to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#15:1>
In other words, if in 1981, we missed roughly 20 out of 1000
persons enumerated, in 1991, one would guess that we might have missed double
the number per thousand persons ( i.e., under enumeration of roughly 4 per
cent).

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#16:1>
This difference of 2 per cent itself means an addition of 17 million
to the provisional figure of 1991 if the <it> higher </it> rate of
under-enumeration is taken into account.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#17:1>
In short, the <it> actual </it> population of India by this logic is
861 million ( for comparing it with the 1981 figure of 685 million) and 878
million if note is taken of the <it> total </it> under-enumeration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#18:1>
But the Indian census never adjusts the data for
under-enumeration because it is possible to give the characteristics of
persons who have not been counted. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#19:1>
<h> <bold> Decadal Growth Rate </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#20:1>
According to the provisional total population figure for India,
the growth of population during 1981-91 was 23.5 per cent, compared to 24.7
per cent in the 1971-81 decade.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#21:1>
Thus, the growth rate during the last decade has only marginally
declined.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#22:1>
This is certainly a reflection on our family planning programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#23:1>
While interpreting statewise figures, one has to estimate the net
migration ( both legal and illegal before pronouncing the final) judgment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#24:1>
In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal, the decadal growth
rate has gone up during 1981-91: migration must have played an important role
in contributing to the higher growth rate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#25:1>
In West Bengal, the continuing migration from Bangladesh adds to
the miseries of that state. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#26:1>
<h> <bold> Remarkable speed in publication of provisional tables
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#27:1>
The Census Commissioner, Mr A.R. Nanda and his colleagues, in
particular, Mr N. Rama Rao, Deputy RegistrarGeneral, deserve
congratulations on the successful completion of the massive census operation
in spite of the disturbed situation in Assam and Punjab and his colleagues
also deserve the fullest credit for bringing out the provisional results with
such remarkable speed ( they have kept up the census tradition) within
three weeks of completion of the revisional rounds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#28:1>
There are not many countries in the world ( including the developed
countries with their advanced computers ) which can match this
achievement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#29:1>
Paradoxically enough, this speed was attained only because the
data were not fully computerised for arriving at the total population figure
of India: hand tabulation by millions of census enumerators made this
possible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#30:1>
As they say in New York, often the fastest way to get to a place is
to walk and not go in your car.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#31:1>
This is true of the Indian census also: hand tabulation is faster
then the electronic computers!

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#32:1>
But one must hasten to add that there are limits to hand tabulation
and it is tragic to note that, in spite of the increasing computerisation of
Indian census table, it takes years for all tables to be published.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#33:1>
It is very frustrating for the users of census data to wait for six
to eight years to get the detailed tables and, by that time, the data get
obsolete and preparations are on for the next census. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#34:1>
<h> <bold> Total population of India </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#35:1>
According to the 1991 census headcount, the total population
of India ( including the projected population of Jammu and Kashmir ) is
843.93 million or 844 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#36:1>
This is certainly lower than what was generally expected.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#37:1>
The projections ranged from 844 million to 865 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#38:1>
Interestingly enough, the Planning <w> Commission's </w> standing
committee of experts on population projections had revised the earlier
estimate of 837 million to 843.6 million or roughly 844 million in 1991.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#39:1>
In short, the census count almost exactly tallies with that
projected figure, namely 844 million. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#40:1>
<h> <bold> Declining sex ratio </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#41:1>
Perhaps the most disquieting feature of the 1991 census is the
unexpected decline in the sex ratio ( number of females per 1000 males).

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#42:1>
In 1981, the government quickly claimed that the increase in the sex
ratio from 930 in 1971 to 934 in 1981 was because of the impact of the MCH (
mother and child health) programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#43:1>
Now we are confronted with a figure of 929, indicating <O> <&>
page </&> 23 </O> a five point decline in the last decade, a figure which is
even lower than the figure in 1971.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#44:1>
Has our MCH programme failed along with the family planning
programme?

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#45:1>
There is no doubt that <w> women's </w> organisations which have
relentlessly campaigned for a better coverage of <w> women's </w> work in
the 1991 census will be very disappointed by this dimension of census result.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#46:1>
<h> <bold> Literacy rate </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#47:1>
In spite of the rapid increase of literates during the last
decade, the literacy rate continues to be low in several major states of
India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#48:1>
It is poor consolation that the number of female literates has
increased rapidly during the last decade when one considers the end result;
as of 1991, the female literacy rate in India as a whole is less than 40 per
cent and in a state like Rajasthan it is less than 21 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#49:1>
The rural/urban breakdown in not yet available but literacy rates
would certainly be lower in the rural area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#50:1>
The six states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, which comprise 51 per cent of <w> India's </w>
population, account for 59 per cent of the illiterate population of India.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#51:1>
It is certainly encouraging to note the high rates of literacy (
male and female) in Kerala which is on the way to attaining 100 per cent
literacy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#52:1>
The overall literacy rate in India in 1991 is 52 per cent for the
total population; it is 64 per cent for males and 39 per cent for females.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#53:1>
While interpreting literacy data, it is important to remember that
these rates do not necessarily imply that all the literate persons go to
school or had some schooling.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#54:1>
The 1991 census asked separate questions on school attendance and
educational level but the results are not yet known.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#55:1>
One can be literate without having any worthwhile educational level.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#56:1>
Then there is the problem of relapse into illiteracy by persons who
were once literate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#57:1>
Literacy figures should therefore be interpreted with caution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#58:1>
One cannot help observing that in spite of the literacy missions,
etc. the overall situation is appalling in India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#59:1>
There is no doubt that the country must give highest priority to the
eradication of illiteracy in the shortest possible time. </p>

<p> An intriguing feature of the projection exercise concerns the state of
Assam where no census could be conducted in 1981 because of disturbed
conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#60:1>
The earlier projection for the population of Assam in 1991 was 25.0
million while the revised projection ( as of 1991) put the figure as 24.8
million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#61:1>
The actual census count in 1991 revealed a figure of 22.3 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#62:1>
Compared to the 1981 projected figure of 19.9 million for Assam, the
rate of growth of <w> Assam's </w> population would have been only 12.1 per
cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#63:1>
This would have implied a high degree of under-enumeration which
would not have been surprising in view of the disturbed conditions there
even in 1991.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#64:1>
The <}> <-> Cenesus</-><+>Census</+> </}> Commission, however, chose
to rewrite demographic history by adjusting the 1981 Figures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#65:1>
By this process the growth rate of Assam was jacked up to 23.6
per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#66:1>
It does appear to us that in view of the high level of
underenumeration in Assam in 1991, the Census Commission reworked the
total population of India in 1981 and the growth rate figure for the 1981-91
decade of India just to show a more acceptable growth rate for Assam.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#67:1>
To our mind this problem could be avoided by adding a footnote to the
Assam figure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#68:1>
It may be recalled that the 1981 census did not make any adjustment
for the longer duration of the inter-censal period ( between 1971 and 1981
because of the delay inconducting the census of 1971 by one month on
account of general elections). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#69:1>
We believe that the projected population of Assam for 1991 was
a more realistic figure than the actual count.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#70:1>
It is also not necessary to adjust the 1981 figure of Assam.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#71:1>
According to our estimate, the 1991 population of India is roughly
846 million ( adjusted for the under-enumeration in Assam).

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#72:1>
Generally speaking, the difference between the provisional figures
and the final figures is of the order of 2 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#73:1>
This will push up the total figure to 848 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#74:1>
It may be recalled that in 1981, the net under-enumeration was of the
order of 1.8 per cent or roughly 2 per cent, if we assume the same degree of
under-enumeration, we have to add another 17 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#75:1>
This brings the total population to 865 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#76:1>
As we have already pointed out, in view of the rapid urbanisation
during the 1981-91 decade, the underenumeration would be higher than 2 per
cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#77:1>
An additional factor was the lack of motivation on the part of the
enumerators who grudged the paltry honorarium given to them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#78:1>
We believe that the extent of underenumeration at the 1991 census
would be around four per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#79:1>
My estimate of the " correct" population of India would be between
870 to 880 million as of 1991. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#80:1>
As noted earlier, the Indian census data do not adjust for
underenumeration for the simple reason that, even if the total count is
adjusted, it would not be possible to present the characteristics of the
under-enumerated population in regard to the table are prepared on the
basis of the census.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#81:1>
Interestingly enough, the post enumeration check ( PEC) data in the
Indian census do not give the statewise figures but the zonewise figures (
based on grouping of several states).

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#82:1>
This is done in order not to expose the Directors of Census in
different states.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#83:1>
But, on statistical grounds, there is a good case for presenting PEC
data statewise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#84:1>
For example, we have reason to believe that, in Bihar, there must
have been considerable under-enumeration and, in particular,
under-enumeration of females.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#85:1>
In Tamil Nadu and Bihar, the quality of the economic census
conducted along with the houselisting operation in 1990 was so poor that
the Director General of the Central Statistical Organisation ( CSO) did
not include these states when the provisional results of the Economic Census
were announced. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#86:1>
<h> <bold> Role of BIMARU states in population stabilisation </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#87:1>
The 1991 census data fully confirm our prognosis that the crux of
<w> India's </w> population problem lies in the four problem states of Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh ( in alphabetical order, the
acronym is BIMARU ) which account for 39 per cent of <w> India's </w>
population and 42 per cent of the net addition of the population of India
during the 1981-91 decade.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#88:1>
UP and Bihar are the most populous states of India and MP and
Rajasthan are the two largest states in terms of area.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#89:1>
In south India, Andhra Pradesh is demographically the most backward
<O> continued on page 71 </O> <O> <&> page </&> 24 </O> <O> continued from

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#90:1>
<w> Orissa's </w> population growth rate is low but this state is
certainly not comparable to <}> <-> demographiclly </-> <+>
demographically </+> </}> modernised states like Punjab.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#91:1>
Orissa has high levels of mortality and infant mortality, the
nutritional levels are appalling and the segment of population below the
poverty line high.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#92:1>
Orissa deserves special attention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#93:1>
Kerala, demographically our most modern state ( if one leaves out
the tiny state Goa ) had unfortunately a very high level of unemployment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#94:1>
One is reminded of George Bernard Shaw who said: <quote> " There are
two tragedies in life: one is not to get your <w> heart's </w> desire, and
the other is to get it." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#95:1>
The demographic modernisation of Kerala has not been matched by
economic growth which goes to show that harping on population growth alone
is not enough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-013#96:1>
It was migration and Gulf money which came to the rescue of Kerala to
some extent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-013#97:1>
Finally, it should be crystal clear that unless the BIMARU states
progress socially, economically and demographically, India can never be on
the path of population stabilisation. </p> <&> a footnote at the end of the
