<h> <bold> <w> Patil's </w> defiance </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#2:1>
At a time when the grave situation created by the eruption of
communal passions in Karnataka calls for the <w> government's </w> undivided
attention, the Congress-I in Karnataka is caught in a crisis with Mr Rajiv
Gandhi asking Chief Minister Veerendra Patil to quit within four days.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#3:1>
The confabulations that preceded the decision and the manner of its
announcement make it clear that last <w> week's </w> rash of riots have come
in handy to jettison Mr Patil on the specious plea that the stroke he
suffered on September 24 has impaired the efficiency of the administration.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#4:1>
There must have been lapses on the part of the State government in
containing the disturbances or providing relief to the riot-hit but there was
little justification for the decision to axe the Chief Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#5:1>
The decision to ask the Congress-I legislature party to meet on
Wednesday and to elect a new leader is undemocratic as there was no demand
from among the MLAs for a change of leadership.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#6:1>
Mr Gandhi should have anticipated that Mr Patil might defy the party
high command and create a piquant situation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#7:1>
Whatever the outcome of the present crisis, the State Congress-I is
not likely to enjoy stability.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#8:1>
It also proves that the claim that Central leadership of the party had
smooth ties with the governments headed by the Congress-I was wrong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#9:1>
Much before Mr Patil fell ill, it was apparent that he had lost
favour with the Congress-I high command as he was suspected of building up a
power base for himself.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#10:1>
As criticism of his style of functioning began to be voiced openly,
Mr Patil found himself engaged more and more in a rearguard battle to save
his chair.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#11:1>
Mr Patil could not have been unaware of the design behind the growing
criticism, notably by AICC-I general secretary C.K.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#12:1>
Jaffar Sharief.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#13:1>
The continuance of the tirade, despite Mr Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w>
personal assurance to the Chief Minister that Mr Sharief will be pulled up,
only underscored the fact that it had the blessings of the high command.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#14:1>
Much the same scenario obtains in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where
Dr Chenna Reddy has been pinned down by the dissidents.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#15:1>
In view of the Congress-I high <w> command's </w> antipathy to
leaders who prefer to stand on their feet and the general tendency of
legislators to safeguard their political future by looking to Delhi for
guidance, Mr Patil stands to gain little by his defiance unless he has chosen
to pursue his career under a different party label.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#16:1>
It is not certain yet that by asking Mr Patil to quit Mr Rajiv Gandhi
is conveying a message to Dr Chenna Reddy and Mr Sharad Pawar that he
continues to believe that as party President he will decide who should rule a
State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#17:1>
But the two Congress-I Chief Ministers are likely to read meanings in
the ongoing developments in Bangalore. </p> <*> line in the middle </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#19:1>
Kamlapati Tripathi was a product of Varanasi and what it
represents - - and of the freedom movement.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#20:1>
Though he was on the Delhi scene for nearly two decades, it was
fitting that he went back to Varanasi to breathe his last.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#21:1>
Like Govind Ballabh Pant and Lal Bahadur Shastri, he left Lucknow
with reluctance.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#22:1>
That he did not rise to the stature of the other two in national
politics was due in part to the different nature of politics during his time
in Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#23:1>
Though he was totally loyal to his leader, like Shastri was to Nehru,
in Mrs Indira Gandhi he had a person who, unlike her father, would not like a
person to bcome too powerful, particularly in her home State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#24:1>
It would not be unfair to say that he did not show the same degree of
administrative skill as the other two.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#25:1>
He was forced to resign as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh after the
PAC revolt in 1973 and then again as Railway Minister in 1980 following Mrs
<w> Gandhi's </w> criticism of the way he was handling the portfolio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#26:1>
Kamlapati Tripathi was essentially a political being and must
have revelled in the ways of Congressmen of his days, but he also understood
its principles and ideology.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#27:1>
He joined the Congress at the age of 15 to fight in the freedom
movement and when he died on Monday at the age of 85 he was still a party
member - - one moreover who had never defected or even wavered in his loyalty
to the party which he thought was the only one which could rule India.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#28:1>
But somehow he equated loyalty to the party to loyalty to four
generations of the Nehru clan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#29:1>
His support for Mrs Gandhi during the 1969 and 1978 splits in the
Congress was crucial for her specially in the most populous State of Uttar
Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#30:1>
Despite Mrs <w> Gandhi's </w> nature, she recognised this trait in
him and made him working President of the party in 1983.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#31:1>
But loyalty alone is not of permanent value.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#32:1>
His influence declined during Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w> tenure as Prime
Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#33:1>
But maybe the latter would have been better off had he listened to
his sage advice.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#34:1>
The loss has been that of Mr Rajiv Gandhi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#35:1>
Like Jawaharlal Nehru, Pandit Kamlapati Tripathi had a deep
belief in secularism.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#36:1>
This was all the more notable for unlike Nehru he was an orthodox
Hindu whose morning <indig> puja </indig> could not be disturbed on any
count.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#37:1>
This belief was epitomised last year when he spoke out against the
move to demolish the Babri Masjid, in fact saying he would physically try to
stop this happening.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#38:1>
This standing by a principle in the face of rising fanaticism is a
trait in short supply among our leaders these days.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#39:1>
In his person he reflected a tolerant and composite culture that used
to be <w> Uttar Pradesh's </w> pride - - as also of India. </p> <*> line in

<h> <bold> A matter of shame </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#41:1>
The cruellest aspect of a dismal showing at an international
sports meet is that the participants tend to get all the blame.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#42:1>
The nation will doubtless be disappointed with <w> India's </w> gold
drought at a Beijing Asiad which ended on Sunday.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#43:1>
But it would be unkind to hold the athletes and other sportspersons
responsible for the failures in their medal hunt.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#44:1>
It is possible some of them did not deserve to be in the squad, but
made it to Beijing through favours.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#45:1>
But there is no need to doubt the genuineness of the efforts of most
of them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#46:1>
The cause of <w> India's </w> worst performance in Asian Games in
their 40-year history is to be found elsewhere.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#47:1>
The record book will note that the only gold India won was in
kabaddi, which South Asians have played for generations and others are barely
familiar with.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#48:1>
The cynics predict even this gold will elude India at the next Asiad
at Hiroshima, for four years are enough time for the Chinese or Koreans to
reach the level of excellence in any game.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#49:1>
It had been hoped India would win seven or eight golds in a medal
tally of around 45.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#50:1>
But the tally of 23 medals is barely half of the modest expectations.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#51:1>
<w> India's </w> sports-politicians own it to the nation to
absolve themselves of the charge that they have done the most to bring shame
on the country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#52:1>
Favouritism and nepotism and faction fights begin at the level of
political administrators of sports.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#53:1>
The disgusting tug-of-war between factions of officials over who
should represent India at Beijing not only made this country an object of
ridicule, but must have affected the morale of the Indian competitors in the
Chinese capital.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#54:1>
This event alone should propel the Government of India to take a hard
look at the entire question of sports administration, creating facilities
like playgrounds, swimming pools and stadia, and the way our sportsmen and
women are being groomed and trained.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#55:1>
What is at stake is not the gold, but to ensure that we are not
pushed out of even the bronze spot.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#56:1>
The Government should rise above petty political considerations in
selecting the persons who will administer sports, pool the best brains that
can advise on recruiting domestic and international coaches, and help in the
preparation of a rigorous plan to raise sports standards, preferably within a
two or five-year time-frame.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#57:1>
There is no time to lose in finding out why we have been sliding down
while other countries are constantly improving their performances. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Unstable UP </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#59:2>
Having played a key part in precipitating the Janata Dal split at
the national level, Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav naturally finds himself embroiled
up to his neck in its fallout in his home State of Uttar Pradesh, where the
two factions are engaged in a desperate struggle for supremacy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#60:2>
The advantage of having backed the <quote> " winning side" </quote>
at the Centre and the lure of governmental patronage in Lucknow may not be
enough to help the Chief Minister ward off the threat to his position in case
the re-alignment taking place in the State unit of the party conforms to
the line-up in Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#61:2>
In fact, the reason why Mr Yadav has not declared his outift as the
Janata Dal(S) even after expelling 31 MLAs could be because of the
realisation that he has not been able to muster the majority of the 210
Janata Dal legislators to survive in office even with the support of the
94-strong Congress-I.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#62:2>
Though only 55 of the 96 MLAs belonging to the former Lok Dal(A) of
Mr Ajit Singh and Mr <w> V.P. Singh's </w> Jan Morcha group have come out
openly demanding the dismissal of Mr Yadav, he cannot view with equanimity
the resignation of five Ministers, who have accused him of needlessly
widening the communal divide over Ayodhya.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#63:2>
The failure of the Janata Dal to elect a leader of the legislature
party after expelling Mr Yadav from the primary membership of the party
provides little consolation to the Chief Minister in view of the growing
resentment among partymen at his <foreign> volte-face </foreign> in siding
with the Chandra Shekhar-Devi Lal faction after giving the impression of
having been with Mr V.P. Singh over both Mandal and Ayodhya issues. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#64:2>
That the V.P. Singh camp also has not succeeded in enlisting the
support of the majority of the legislators is evident from the statement of
Mr Ajit Singh that the election of the new leader would take place only after
the Chief Minister faces the trial of strength in the Assembly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#65:2>
The new strategy adopted is to force Mr Yadav to seek a vote of
confidence, which would compel him to obtain Congress-I support in the House
with an effective strength of 423, where the backing of the 13-member Bahujan
Samaj Party and the 30 Independents alone may not be enough to ensure his
survival.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#66:2>
While opposition within the State unit of the Congress-I to any move
to bail out Mr Yadav is building up, the Chief Minister himself would like to
avoid this course in view of the electoral damage it could do to the platform
of fierce anti-Congressism on which he had built his political career.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#67:2>
This has raised the stakes for the two factions in mobilising maximum
support among legislators through all manner of inducements.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#68:2>
It is a measure of the success the V.P. Singh group has registered
with its campaign that in ditching it Mr Yadav has compromised on secularism
and social justice that he felt obliged to prove his <foreign> bona fides
</foreign> by raising the reservation quota of backward castes in government
jobs from 15 to 27 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#69:2>
While this cynical decision is unlikely to enhance Mr <w> Yadav's
</w> pro-Mandal credentials, it has the potential of reviving the embers of
the caste war in UP.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#70:2>
Whatever the outcome of the power struggle, the <w> nation's </w>
biggest State is in for a period of political instability. </p> <*> line in

<h> <bold> What next in Gulf? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-003#72:2>
Three months after Iraq swallowed up Kuwait, the situation still
remains poised between war and a diplomatic solution.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#73:2>
Except for American and British hawks and some in the Arab world,
most countries would prefer the latter.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#74:2>
The resumption of efforts to hold an Arab summit by Morocco has led
to hopes that this might be in the offing.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#75:2>
The visits by Soviet envoy Yevgeni Primikov and Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen to Baghdad among other West Asian capitals are in line
with the rejection by Moscow and Beijing of a military solution and search
for a diplomatic one.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#76:2>
US Secretary of State James Baker also could not rope in many
Security Council members during his peregrinations abroad to pass a
resolution immediately to authorise the use of force against Iraq.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#77:2>
More worrying in a way for President George Bush is the increasing
opposition at home with Republicans, Democrats and others cautioning the
President especially after his decision to send another 100,000 trops to the
Gulf.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#78:2>
Some Senators are asking the President to explain why liberating
Kuwait <quote> " is in our vital interests" </quote> or why the US should be
the <quote> " sole policeman" </quote> with Senator Patrick Moynihan bluntly
saying that it will be a war which <quote> " cannot be won" </quote> and
warning that if a war takes place <quote> " we will leave the Gulf in ruins
and we will destroy the presidency in the process." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#79:2>
It is thus doubtful if President Bush would be able to get
Congressional approval for a declaration of war.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#80:2>
If he launches one without such approval it could divide the nation a
second time since Vietnam.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#81:2>
It thus seems probable that short of an accident, war - - or at least
a land war - - can be ruled out. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#82:2>
Those who have been to Iraq say that the sanctions have not begun
to bite.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#83:2>
There is plenty of food and a relaxed atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#84:2>
On the other hand most knowledgeable commentators are agreed that
Iraq ultimately will agree to pull out of Kuwait, except from some border
areas including the Rumaila oilfield and a couple of islands.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#85:2>
This might not amount to punishing the aggressor, as some would like
to, but it would certainly show that aggression does not pay.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#86:2>
War, moreover, would result in thousands of casualties and the
destruction of the oil wells.

<ICE-IND:W2E-003#87:2>
The US and its allies also have to keep in mind that a military
action would not only turn the Arabs against the United States but would make
Syria and Iran stronger - - not an eventuality the West can view with
unconcern. </p> <*> line in the middle </*> </I>
