<ICE-IND:S2B-030#1:1:A>
Reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#2:1:A>
For this to occur sperm <,> a male gamete <,> and the ovum <,> the  
female gamete are necessary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#3:1:A>
A proper understanding of a male reproductive system <,> is  
essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#4:1:A>
The male reproductive system <,> provides for the production and  
subsequent delivery <,> of a highly specialised <,> male gamete called sperm  
<,,> which is produced in the testies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#5:1:A>
<}> The <-> <.> ca </.> </-> <=> the cell </=> </}> consists of  
paternal genes <,> and this genetic complement <,> is transferred to the  
female gamete <,> during the act of fertilisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#6:1:A>
To facilitate <,> the essential function <,> a male reproductive  
system forms a <}> <-> <.> complet </.> </-> <=> complete </=> </}> structure  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#7:1:A>
The organisation of the male reproductive system <,,> comprises a  
pair of testes <,,> epididemus <,,> vasaeference <,> a complex array of  
accessory male genetic glands <,,> penis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#8:1:A>
In many animals <,> the testes is a scrotal imposition <,> just as  
in the case of man <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#9:1:A>
But in some species <,> testes occupy abdominal positions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#10:1:A>
There are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#11:1:A>
The position of the testes <,> in different groups of mamal shows  
enormous variation <,> in terms of its location <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#12:1:A>
For example in the case of elephant <,> higher access <,> the  
testes lies just behind the kidney <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#13:1:A>
In the case of hedgehog <,> and some other insectivores <,> the  
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#14:1:A>
In the case of <,> pigs <,> rats <,> horses <,> rabbits <,> dogs  
and cats <,> the position of the testes <,> is in non pendulum scrotum <,> is  
underneath the anus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#15:1:A>
In dolphins <,> armedillos <?> cavity <?> slogs <,> the testes is  
located at posterior end of <,> abdomen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#16:1:A>
In the case of moults shoos and some species of birds <,> the  
testes is located at the base of the tail <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#17:1:A>
In sheep <,> cattle <,> and other ruminants also in some primates  
<,> the scrotum is pendulous <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#18:1:A>
The typical male reproductive system consists of <,> pair testes  
<,,> which may be located in the scrotum <,> or may be present in the abdomen  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#19:1:A>
The testes <,,> are uh provided <,> with a thick fibres cover <,>  
called tunica alveginia <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#20:1:A>
The testes is divided into many compartments <,> and consists of  
many coil <,,> tibules which are called as semeniferous tibules <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#21:1:A>
In between seminiferous tibules <,> lie special type of cells <,>  
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#22:1:A>
The semeniferous tibules <,> in a section <,> consists of large  
number of <,> cell types <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#23:1:A>
Basically these cell types <,> are two <,,> the germs cells <,> and  
the cells of sattory <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#24:1:A>
The germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa  
<,> while the cells of sattory basically have the nutritive function <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#25:1:A>
If the cross section of the <,> semeniferous tibule is examined <,>  
one would find <,> the upper pair <,> of cells to be spermatogonia <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#26:1:A>
These themselves are of several types <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#27:1:A>
They have been classified into spermatogonia of the a <,> b and  
intermediate type <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#28:1:A>
Even the a and b type of spermatogonia <,> are of several subtypes  
<,> which are classified on the basis of <,> their cytological  
characteristics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#29:1:A>
The first generation of primary spermatocites cells <,,> these  
undergo <,> myosis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#30:1:A>
The myosis itself is of two types <,,> reduction division <,> where  
a number of chromosomes is reduced to half <,> and myosis two which is an  
equational division <,> where there is an increase in the number of cells <,>  
unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#31:1:A>
A primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites <,>  
which I have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid  
cells <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#32:1:A>
The secondary spermatocites <,> grow into round spermatics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#33:1:A>
These spermatics <,> undergo a process of differentiation <,> which  
is called as spermeogenesis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#34:1:A>
There are essentially four basic steps in this process <,> one is  
called as gorgie <,> followed by a cap phase <,> and agrosome phase and a  
maturation phase <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#35:1:A>
The <,,> spermatozoa which are derive from spermatics <,> are  
highly organised <,> cells <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#36:1:A>
From a genetic point of view <,> these sperms are half cells  
because they contain <,> haploid or half the number of chromosomes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#37:1:A>
If you take the example of human <,,> the deployed number <,> for  
dual number chromosomes is forty-six <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#38:1:A>
At the end of spermatogenesis therefore <,> the sperm contains <,>  
twenty-three chromosomes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#39:1:A>
These sperms may contain <,> either x chromosome or y <,> and  
genetically <,> therefore they are dimorphic <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#40:1:A>
This text just enumerated above <,> describe a typical structure of  
the seminiferous epithilium <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#41:1:A>
However this should be understood <,,> that the <,> cells present  
in the seminiferous epithilium <,> are in a stage of progressive development  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#42:1:A>
All seminiferous epithilium cells <,> do not show the same <,>  
associations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#43:1:A>
That is <,> that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous  
tibules is different <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#44:1:A>
Sometimes <,> a large variety of <,> cells can be seen in  
successive stages of development <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#45:1:A>
The cell association <,> is the term used to describe <,> the  
arrangement of cells <,,> that is spermatogonia the primary spermatocites <,>  
despermatates and the differentiation <,> process that is seen <,> in the  
process of sperm formation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#46:1:A>
In the case of man there are six cell associations <,> and fourteen  
different cell types have been identified <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#47:1:A>
The <,> cycle of development in the seminiferous epithilium <,>  
which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm <,> is  
called as <,> sex cycle of the seminiferous epithilium <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#48:1:A>
It takes about seventy-four days <,> for a sperm to be derived from  
<,> the spermatogonia <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#49:1:A>
The sperm formed in the testes <,,> are incapable of <,>  
fertilization <,,> and therefore <,> they have to <,,> be <,> uh <,> they  
have to transit through <,,> <}> <-> <.> o </.> </-> <=> other </=> </}>  
parts of the reproductive system <,> particularly <,> the epididamus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#50:1:A>
The root of spermatozoa is quite definite <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#51:1:A>
From the testes they go into the retitestes <,> and from where they  
go through <,> a small ducts which are called as vasaefeverence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#52:1:A>
The vasaeference lead these <,> sperms into <,> the epididamus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#53:1:A>
The epididamus itself consists of three main parts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#54:1:A>
The top part which sits <,> as a cap on the testes <,> is called as  
cafort epididamus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#55:1:A>
The second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called  
as corpus <,> and the terminal or tail part of <,,> the epididamus is called  
as corder <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#56:1:A>
During their transit <,> from cafort to corpus and finally to  
corder <,> this sperm undergo <,> vast and complex maturational changes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#57:1:A>
It can rightly be said <,> that the epididamus is the main point  
<,> where the sperm undergo morphological <,> biochemical and physiological  
changes <,> which endorsed and <,> the property of <,> fertilizing the egg  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#58:1:A>
The <,,> sperm <,> principally <,> uh undergo <,> changes in their  
membrane property <,,> in the maturation of uh <,> the acrosome <,> in the  
<,,> uh ability to <,> be more motile as they <,> come into the corder <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#59:1:A>
It has also been seen <,> that the sperms on the cafort are  
incapable of fertilizing the egg <,> and at best <,> the rate of  
fertilization is about five percent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#60:1:A>
Corpus sperm usually <,> are better about twenty percent but by the  
time they reach the corder epididamus <,> they their fertilizing potential is  
about ninety-five percent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#61:1:A>
From the corder <,> they are <,> transported to vasaeference <,>  
and from there they are mixed with <,> secretions of the essentially male  
genetic glands <,> the prostate <,> the seminal cycles <,> the valbo electral  
glands also called as scoupers <,> and some other minor glands which are  
found <,> in some species but not in others <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#62:1:A>
The mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#63:1:A>
The typical mamalian spermatozoa <,> consists of three main parts  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#64:1:A>
The head <,> the mid piece <,> and the tail <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#65:1:A>
The head is not <,> itself a simple structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#66:1:A>
It contains on its interior aspect <,> a structure which is called  
as acrosome <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#67:1:A>
<-> The </-> <,,> under the acrosome <,,> lies the nucleus which  
takes on the same shape <,> as the head itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#68:1:A>
The second part <,> of the sperm is called as <,> the mid piece <,>  
which contains <,> the powerhouse of the cell <,,> called mitochondria <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#69:1:A>
These mitochondria helically arranged <,> and contains the  
necessary enzymes <,> which can use the nutrients of the seminal fluid <,>  
for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#70:1:A>
The acrosome itself <,> contains three different types of enzymes  
<,> which are used in the process of fertilization <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#71:1:A>
The tail consists of three main parts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#72:1:A>
The <,> principal piece the end piece <,> and a <,,> place where  
the mid piece joins the <,> tail <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#73:1:A>
The tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine  
peripheral filaments <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#74:1:A>
The shape of this spermatozoa <,,> is very variable in the animals  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#75:1:A>
The number of sperms produced <,> is also highly variable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#76:1:A>
For instance in the case of humans <,> the number of sperms  
produced in one ejaculate <,> is of the order of two hundred to four hundred  
million <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#77:1:A>
The <,> physiological function of the testes <,> depend on a  
complex interplay <,> of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine  
secretions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#78:1:A>
In principle <,,> extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are  
involved <,> with the stimulation of the nervous system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#79:1:A>
A part of the nervous system called hypothalamus <,> contains  
special type of nerve cells <,> which are called as neurosecretary cells <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#80:1:A>
These cells <,> secrete hormone <,> which is called as <?>  
gonadotropin </?> releasing hormone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#81:1:A>
These hormones <,> can be transported to the pituitry <,,> by a  
vascular root or thorugh nural connections <,,> and it stimulate cells of the  
pituitry <,,> which in turn produces two types of hormones <,> F S H <,> and  
L H <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#82:1:A>
The F S H act from the seminiferous epithilium <,> and brings about  
<,> the development and differentiation of various egg cell types namely <,>  
from spermatogonia <,> to spermatocites <,> of primary and secondary type to  
spermatits <,> and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#83:1:A>
The F S H also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal  
elements <,> and these in turn secrete certain proteins <,> which bind with  
the androgene produced in the ladic cells <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#84:1:A>
Such <}> <-> bound androgene proteins </-> <=> androgene bound  
proteins </=> </}> <,> hormones are again carried to <,> the testicular  
germinal epithelium <,> where they bring about <,> sustenance of  
spermatogenesis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#85:1:A>
The second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as  
L H <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#86:1:A>
But in the case of male it is called as <?> interstitial </?> cell  
stimulating hormone <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#87:1:A>
This hormone acts on ladic cells <,> of the testes <,> and <,> <}>  
<-> <.> cau </.> </-> <=> causes </=> </}> the release of androgene <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#88:1:A>
Androgene are important for large number of functions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#89:1:A>
For instance androgene <,> which are bound to androgene binding  
protein produce certoli cells <,> are important for spermatogenesis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#90:1:A>
Androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland  
functions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#91:1:A>
Androgenes are also involved <,> with the development and  
differentiation of secondary sex characteristics <,> and they are also  
concerned with libido <,> and sexual behaviour in the case of animals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#92:1:A>
In many animals <,,> the these events of endocrine <,> secretions  
occur cyclically <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#93:1:A>
For instance there are many animals in which <,> these phenomena  
occurs only once a year <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#94:1:A>
In others where this <,> events may occur twice a year <,> or in  
still others <,> this <,,> event may occur several times in a year <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#95:1:A>
In the case of man <,,> the process of spermatogenesis once it has  
started continues <,,> for a very long period of time <,,> to the age of  
seventy or even eighty years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#96:1:A>
However <,> the limiting factors in the start of reproductive  
activities in the <,> endocrine elements as well as in the <,> testicular and  
ladic cells <,,> depends on the attainment of puberty <,> which are complex  
sexual maturational changes <,> that are <,> time dependent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#97:1:A>
In the case of human male they begin <+> to </+> occur at the age  
of <,> fifteen years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#98:1:A>
The testicular spermatozoa thus produced <,,> find a way into <,>  
the epididamus where <?> sperms <?> <,> undergo maturational changes <,>  
described above <,,> as well as <,,> they transit into <,> the vasaeference  
</?> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#99:1:A>
The flow of sperms from epididamus to <,> the vaseeference is  
partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#100:1:A>
From vaseeference <,> the <,,> sperms are mixed with the seminal  
secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#101:1:A>
They come into the urethra <,,> and uh <,> the terminal part of  
the urethra <,> is the penis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#102:1:A>
This penis is of <,> two main types <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#103:1:A>
In the case of humans <,> the penis is described as <,> a vascular  
type <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#104:1:A>
Because the erection of the penis depends on <,> congestion of  
blood <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#105:1:A>
There are two main mechanisms for this erection <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#106:1:A>
One is reflexogenic <,> by spinal stimulation <,> and the other is  
<,> by vasocongestion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#107:1:A>
The <,> vasocongestion in this case <,> may be psychogenic in <,>  
in the case of man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#108:1:A>
The second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other  
carnivores <,> is called as <,> the vibroelastic type <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#109:1:A>
For copulation <,> the sperms are deposited in female genital  
tract <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#110:1:A>
The <,,> sperm <,> uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#111:1:A>
This has an alcaline ph <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#112:1:A>
The place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#113:1:A>
In the case of humans <,> the sperms are deposited in the vagina  
<,> but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the  
uterus <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#114:1:A>
Irrespective of the site of deposition <,> the millions of sperms  
<,> face very hostile environment <,> in the vagina and in the cervix <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#115:1:A>
The <,,> ninety-nine percent of the sperms <,> or even more are  
destroyed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#116:1:A>
In the case of human female <,,> the sperms are able to reach the  
felopian tube where the egg awaits them <,> and nearly one thousands to three  
thousands such sperms may surround the egg <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-030#117:1:A>
Of these only one will <?> one </?> fuse with the egg <,> and this  
ensures <,> the beginning of a new life <,,> </I>
