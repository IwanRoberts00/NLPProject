Tomorrow <,> is to observe this event we now bring you a talk
entitled <,> <mention> Higher education and women </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#X4:1>
The speaker is Dr Vasanti Rasam <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#X5:1>
And she is highlighting <,> the factors responsible for such a low
female literacy <,> and makes certain recommendation <,,> </X> </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-034#6:1:A>
Problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of
system <,> with varying degrees <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#7:1:A>
Neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way
in achieving equal status to that of man <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#8:1:A>
On the other hand <,> Indian women have been oppressed in all the
fields at two levels <,> at the caste and class level <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#9:1:A>
In educational sphere too <,> women have been opressed under the
traditional set up of our society <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#10:1:A>
Recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the
conditions of women in India considering them <,> to be a part of national
development process <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#11:1:A>
The major thrust of the <mention> Seventh Five Year Plan </mention>
<,> was on the development of women <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#12:1:A>
The basic approach would be <,> to enable women to acquire
confidence in themselves <,> and <,> to develop a sense of responsibility <,>
towards the overall development and betterment of society <,> and their
individual personality <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#13:1:A>
All this comes in a country where <,> horrifying atrocities have
been committed against women since ages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#14:1:A>
Even fifty years ago <,> female infanticide <,> child marriage <,>
and subsequent widowhood <,> <indig> sati devdasi </indig> etcetera <,> were
widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#15:1:A>
With independence came <,> the age of social reform to eradicate
the evils against women <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#16:1:A>
But still today <,> even if you just scratch the surface of Indian
culture <,> we are exposed to the male dominated society <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#17:1:A>
Where did we go wrong then <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#18:1:A>
Why does the Indian women still reveal in stereotype role <,> of
self sacrifice rather than <,> those of self awareness <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#19:1:A>
The blame must surely lie <,> at the doors of our educational
system <,> which is nearly a ritual <,> rather than an effective means of
equalising opportunity <,> and erasing the sex bias <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#20:1:A>
Education for girls was <,> and is still influenced by a wide range
of factors <,> which are considerably different from those that affect boys
education <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#21:1:A>
It can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged <,>
and tolerated after an age or after certain standard <,> at which <,> it can
do little good or little harm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#22:1:A>
The notion that education itself whether primary secondary or
higher <,> is harmful <,> was prevalent upto yester years and is still
relevent <,> as far as higher education is concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#23:1:A>
This notion <,> limited the exposure of women <,> to the external
world and influences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#24:1:A>
The basic conviction that there is something special about womens
nature <,> which could be destroyed by excessive education <,> portrayed the
uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii <,> of boys and
girls <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#25:1:A>
The rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle
work <,> embroidery <,> and vernacular language <,> were being regarded as
more than adequate for girls <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#26:1:A>
Once a demand for <w> women's </w> education came from the social
reformers <,> for their emancipation <,> there was also demand for educated
bride <,> for a new western educated breed of men <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#27:1:A>
Thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent
wife and mother to <,> intelligent companion <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#28:1:A>
The liberational role of education <,> emphasised by the radicals
had been subordinated to the social goal of <,> willing <,> admissal and not
a questioning and an enquiring mind <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#29:1:A>
Here one can note the conflict between the ideals of <,> womenhood
of our society <,> and the ideals of education <,> which lead to creation of
a certain measure of independent thought <,> a spirit of enquiry <,> and of
objectivity <,> which as a bind by men of our society <,> could threaten <,>
the well maintained differences between the sexes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#30:1:A>
And <,> they also feared that their control over women <,> would be
marginalised <,> with too much of education of wrong kind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#31:1:A>
This ideological difference continued to be preserved today <,>
despite the efforts made by various planning commissions <,> for the
improvement of <,> female literacy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#32:1:A>
<mention> Mrs Durgabai Deshmukh committee </mention> put forth the
view that in no way was education a threat to family life <,> and that today
<,> there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of
work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#33:1:A>
This opinion was reiterated <,> by the <mention> Kothari Commission
</mention> also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#34:1:A>
<mention> The Hansa Mehta Committee </mention> holds that
inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men <,> and women through
socialisation <,> which continues to be extremely powerful <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#35:1:A>
Which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in
India in ninety seventy-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#36:1:A>
Of recent <,> the <mention> Seventh Five Year Plan </mention> <,>
threw <,> the challenge to education a policy perspective <,> listed some
laudable goals of education for women also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#37:1:A>
Despite the above effort <,> and an increase in the girls
enrollment at primary and middle school level <,> the percentage of absolute
<,> or absolute magnitude as compared to boys is still low <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#38:1:A>
Further <,> even though the performance of girls <,,> compared
favourably with that of boys <,> only a limited number of girls <,> seek
admission into higher education <,> or professional courses other than those
pertaining to medicine <,> <w> teachers' </w> training and nursing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#39:1:A>
The drop out rate also in case of girls <,> at middle school level
is much higher than <,> boys <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#40:1:A>
What then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#41:1:A>
One of course <,> is poverty <,> where a <w> family's </w> economic
<,> and financial problem <,> do not give an opportunity to girls <,> where
preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter <,> who is to be
married off and sent to <-> some </-> another family <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#42:1:A>
The second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural
biases of society <,> and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent
to the future role <,> expectation of a wife and a mother <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#43:1:A>
It may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls
to distant or coeducational institution <,> and are averse to those in which
there are no women teachers <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#44:1:A>
While for the rural women <,> education is considered unnecessary
<,> for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage
market <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#45:1:A>
Despite the fact <,> that the system has the attitude <,> the
brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#46:1:A>
This is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to
social and familiar expectation <,> as to <,> what a girls basic role in life
is to be <,> a good bride <,> intelligent companion <,> but not an enquiring
mind <,> but <,> a devoted mother <,> and who may if she has time work at
most as a teacher or as a clerk <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#47:1:A>
It is also unfortunately true that <,> even girls at large choose
to believe <,> that there can be no fulfilment in combining many roles <,> or
to compete <,> in the male dominated area <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#48:1:A>
Interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post
graduate level <,> is higher than <,> at the undergraduate level <,> which
shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of
prejudice <,> they proceed to acquire further degree and perhaps a job <,>
not doubting their aptitude <,> but have mental ability of <,> her mind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#49:1:A>
Indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current <,>
on one hand <,> she is a best <-> by </-> model handed down by our
traditional society <,> and on the other <,> she is being communicated by
various agencies <,> negating these morals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#50:1:A>
Woman therefore <,> is responsible <,> themselves <,> partially as
she does not take <,> a stance even when she is badly pushed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#51:1:A>
Those who have an opportunity to get higher education <,> even as
far as post graduation and doctorate <,> are not able to decide for
themselves <,> to make a career <,,> as <,> it would depend once again on the
man <,> her husband <,> or in-laws to decide for her future after her
marriage <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#52:1:A>
<w> There's </w> no doubt <,> state of women literacy is improving
<,> yet as compared to that of male literacy is still low <,> more so in
rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#53:1:A>
Moreover <,> even today <,> educational institutions are not
regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training
for a good vocation <,> but as respectable <,> waiting rooms for girls who
are to be married off <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#54:1:A>
Thus the function of education also will <,,> relatively <+> be
</+> different in case of girls and boys <,> to date <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#55:1:A>
The dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world <,>
coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is
result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas <,> or otherwise called the
safe educational realms of study for girls <,> and avoiding others <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#56:1:A>
The major efforts of the <}> <-> <.> libera </.> </-> <=> liberal
</=> </}> forces to improve womens educational status <,> by raising the age
of marriage <,> and emphasising education as an important means of
emancipation <,> cannot be denied <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#57:1:A>
Yet <,> the liberal view of education <,> as a liberating force <,>
is however undermined or the limit <,> to access <,> <-> to </-> education
posed by womens role in the family <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#58:1:A>
For all the classes of women <,> the content in role of education
victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#59:1:A>
Thus <,> if education is to play a due role in translating <w>
women's </w> equality from the pages <,> of the constitution to actual
reality <,> then <,> education policy must introduce basic issues like as
access or reduction <,> and later elimination of gender disparity <,> within
the educational process <,> which also reflects in employment socio-political
participation opportunities <,> for personal growth <,> and competence which
alone can build defences against <,> degradation <,> exploitation or
oppression <,> and lead to <,> self confident individual <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#60:1:A>
This requires <,> educational system <,> to take up the task of
changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society
<,> to one of the equal participation <,> in all socio- <,> economic and
political processes <,> and national and international development <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#61:1:A>
For this <,> the educational programme for female literacy needs to
be re-evaluated <,> and formulated a new <,> in the light of experience of
the bygone years <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#62:1:A>
A general plan for education which is not taken into account <,>
the specific problems <,> faced by women <,> fails to benefit them <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-034#63:1:A>
Thus <,> a kind of grassroot input <,> is necessary <,> so that <,>
the programmes planned at the ministerial level <,> translate themselves into
meaningful developmental input <,,> </I>
