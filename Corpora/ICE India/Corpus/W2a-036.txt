<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#13:1>
Developed in England, slow sand filtration has been used for
treating drinking water from the beginning of the nineteenth century.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#14:1>
It has been proven to be an effective process for the removal of
microorganisms if operated under proper conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#15:1>
Even though the most commonly used method of filtration now a days is
<mention> rapid sand filtration </mention> in which water moves down at a
much greater rate than in slow sand filtration, high construction cost and
maintenance requirements make it unsuitable for application in rural areas of
developing countries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#16:1>
Considerable pretreatment, namely <mention> coagulation-sedimentation
</mention> is necessary for a rapid sand filter for effective
purification.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#17:1>
Though sand filtration is effective in the removal of particulates
including microorganisms, it is not efficient in removing other contaminants
from water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#18:1>
Recently, attempts have been made to modify sand siliceous materials,
like <mention> diatomaceous earth </mention> by coating it with different
chemicals, such as <mention> metal hydroxides </mention> and to use the
modified materials in the removal of various contaminats from <mention> water
</mention> and <mention> wastewater </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#19:1>
This paper briefly reviews the research on <mention> slow sand
</mention> and <mention> diatomaceous earth filtration </mention> , and
discusses the results of recent investigations on the application of
<mention> modified sand </mention> and other <mention> siliceous materials in
water </mention> and <mention> wastewater treatment </mention> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#20:1>
<h> <bold> REMOVAL OF MICROORGANISMS BY SLOW SAND FILTRATION </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#21:1>
In slow sand filtration, uncoagulated water is applied to a
sand bed of about 1 m deep at a filtration rate of 0.1 m / hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#22:1>
Impurities in water are removed by a combination of <mention>
processes-sedimentation </mention> , <mention> straining </mention> ,
<mention> adsorption </mention> and <mention> biological action </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#23:1>
During the first few days, water is purified mainly by mechanical
and physical processes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#24:1>
The resulting accumulation of sediments and organic growth forms a
biologically active scum layer ( schmutzdecke ) on the sand surface.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#25:1>
As the water enters the schmutzecke, biological action breaks down
some of the organic matter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#26:1>
Impurities carried deeper into the filter bed come into contact with
and become attached to sand grains, and the sand particles become covered
with a thin layer of organic materials and microorganisms which in turn
adsorbs the impurities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#27:1>
When the resistance in the filter skin increases, filtration
capacity can be restored by draining off the supernatant water and
removing the top 1 - 2 cm of the sand bed including the schmutzdecke. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#28:1>
<mention> Slow sand filtration </mention> has proven to be an
effective process in the removal of various microorganisms, if operated
correctly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#29:1>
Most of the studies <O> <&> page </&> 582 </O> showed more than
99.0 % removal of coliform bacteria.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#30:1>
Uncertainty exists about the role of schmutzdecke in bacterial
removal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#31:1>
While most of the studies showed a decrease in bacterial removal
after the removal of schmutzdecke, Cullen and Letterman ( 1985 ) did not
notice any effect of filter ripening on the bacterial removal while
evaluating municipal slow sand filters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#32:1>
Datta and Chaudhuri ( 1991 ) observed that a mature filter was
well-populated throughout with active microorganisms, with its maximum in
the top 20 - 25 cm layer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#33:1>
Virus removal by slow sand filtration has been evaluated by many
researchers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#34:1>
Poynter and Slade ( 1977 ) found that <it> <mention> Escherichia coli
</mention> </it> removals were similar to or slightly less than poliovirus
removals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#35:1>
The mechanism of virus removal by <mention> slow sand filtration
</mention> is not clearly resolved.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#36:1>
Robeck <it> et al. </it> ( 1962 ) reported that removal of
poliovirus by <mention> clean sand beds </mention> was not significant which
suggests that adsorption did not account for most of the virus removal
accomplished in a slow sand filter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#37:1>
On the other hand, McConnell <it> et al. </it> ( 1984 ) did not find
any effects related to the ripening of the sand bed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#38:1>
They reported that influent reovirus, concentrations were reduced
by greater than 5 log units in a slow sand filter having either clean sand
or aged sand.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#39:1>
This suggests that microbiological actions may not necessarily be
responsible for observed virus inactivation in the sand bed and that
virus may adsorb onto sand very readily. </p>

<h> <bold> REMOVAL OF MICROORGANISM BY DIATOMACEOUS EARTH
FILTRATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#41:1>
<mention> Diatomaceous earth filtration </mention> was developed
during the second world war primarily to ensure complete removal of <it>
<mention> Endamoeba histolytica cysts </mention> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#42:1>
A number of studies have been reported on the effectiveness of
<mention> diatomaceous earth filtration </mention> in the removal of
bacteria, virus and <it> Giardia </it> cysts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#43:1>
Lange <it> et al. </it> ( 1936 ) evaluated <it> Giardia </it> cysts
removal by diato maceous earth filtration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#44:1>
They operated a diatomaceous earth test filter at different flow
rates over a temperature range of 3 to 15 <*> degrees</*>C and with different
particle size distribution of diatomaceous earth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#45:1>
<it> Giardia </it> cyst removal always exceeded 99 % and exceeded
99.9 % in 50 % of the runs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#46:1>
Schuler <it> et al. </it> ( 1991 ) reported that diatomaceous
earth filtration can be expected to remove 100 % of <it> Giardia </it> cysts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#47:1>
Lange <it> et al. </it> ( 1986 ) evaluated removal of coliform
bacteria by diatomaceous earth filtration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#48:1>
Removal varied with the grade used, ranging from 30 to 70 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#49:1>
Schuler <it> et al. </it> ( 1991 ) reported that removal of coliform
bacteria was profoundly affected by the grade of diatomaceous earth used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#50:1>
Coarse grades obtained removals between 0 and 57 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#51:1>
Removal in excess of 99 % could be obtained when a finer grade of
diatomaceous earth was used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#52:1>
Brown <it> et al. </it> ( 1974 ) evaluated removal of viruses
using <mention> bacateriophage T2 </mention> and poliovirsus by <mention>
diatomaceous earth filtration </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#53:1>
They observed average bacteriophage removals in the range of
73-100 % depending on the grade used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#54:1>
Finer filter grades were more effective.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#55:1>
Poliovirus removal ranged from 60 to 100 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#56:1>
They concluded that diatomaceous earth filtration can reduce the
concentration of viruses in water; but the most effective technique
requires either conditioning of the raw water or conditioning of the
diatomaceous earth to enhance virus attachemnt to the diatomaceous
earth during filtration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#57:1>
Chaudhuri <it> et al. </it> ( 1974 ) observed that there was little,
if any, removal of bacteriophages by filtration through diatomaceous
earth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#58:1>
However, filtration through diatomaceous earth coated with
cationic polyelectrolyte resulted in significant virus removal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#59:1>
They also found that the efficiency of virus removal was affected by
several variables, like pH, type of diatomaceous earth, turbidity and
filtration rate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#60:1>
From the above, it is clear that diatomaceous earth filtration has
the capacity to remove a variety of microorganisms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#61:1>
It is most effective when microorganisms are in the size range of
<it> Giardia </it> or <it> E. histolytica </it> cysts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#62:1>
Smaller organisms may also be removed, however, if the removal
mechanisms is straining, the diatomaceous paraticle size must be finer as the
size of target organism decreases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#63:1>
If this surface attachment is the removal mechanism, coarse grades of
diatomaceous earth can be coated with metallic hydroxide flocs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#64:1>
The resulting positively charged diatomaceous earth can remove
microorganisms by surface attachment. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#65:1>
<h> <bold> VIRUS REMOVAL USING METAL HYDROXIDE COATED DIATOMACEOUS
EARTH </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#66:1>
The ability of metallic hydroxides to adsorb viruses in water has
led to efforts to use such precipitates in flowthrough systems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#67:1>
But poor adhesion of the precipitate to the filter material and
clogging have been encountered in using insoluble metallic hydrodixe
flocs in conjuction with filter supports ( Farrah <O> <&> page </&> 583 </O>
<it> et al., </it> 1991 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#68:1>
To overcome these difficulties, Farrah <it> et al. </it> ( 1991 )
modified diatomaceous earth by <it> <foreign> in situ </foreign> </it>
precipitation of metallic hydroxides, such as aluminium, calcium, iron or
magnesium and used it for removal and recovery of viruses from water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#69:1>
The modification decreased the negative charge on the diatomaceous
earth and increased its ability to adsorb viruses in water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#70:1>
Filter containing diatomaceous earth modified by <it> in situ
</it> precipitation of iron and aluminium adsorbed greater than 80 % of
enteroviruses ( poliovirus 1, echovirus 5 and coxsackievirus B5) and
coliphage MS2 present in tapwater at ambient pH ( 7.8 - 8.3 ) , even after
filtration of 100 lit of tapwater.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#71:1>
Electrostatic interactions were found to be more important than
hydrophobic interaction in virus adsorption to modified diatomaceous
earth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#72:1>
In another study, Farrah and Preston ( 1991 ) coated diatomaceous
earth with magnesium peroxide and used this medium for adsorbing
viruses from water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#73:1>
Filters containing 3.5 g of diatomaceous earth adsorbed an average of
greater than 90 % of <mention> MS2 </mention> , poliovirus 1 and
coxsackievirus B5 in tapwater at approximately pH 8.5 even after
filtration of 100 lit of tapwater through the filter. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#74:1>
<h> <bold> ARSENIC REMOVAL BY SAND FILTRATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#75:1>
Excess arsenic in groundwater has been reported from different
parts of the country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#76:1>
Recent discovery of arsenic as carcinogens has added new dimension
to the established health effects, such as gastrointestinal damage due to
arsenic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#77:1>
The conventional methods of arsenic removal, such as precipitation,
adsorption and ion exchange are not suitable for application in villages as
these processes are cost- and energy-intensive, and require skilled
operation and maintenance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#78:1>
In view of this, Guha and Chaudhuri ( 1991 ) conducted studies to
develop low-cost point-of-use treatment devices for use in rural areas of
developing countries, like India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#79:1>
They conducted laboratory studies employing <mention> As ( <roman> 3
</roman> ) - spiked groundwater </mention> to screen sorbent, such as
bituminous coal, lignite, crushes coconut shell, illite, kaolinite, rice
husk, flyash, charcoal and sand.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#80:1>
Based on batch and short-term column studies, sand emerged as the
most potentially useful medium.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#81:1>
Sand was more effective in arsenic removal above pH 7.0.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#82:1>
In long duration column study ( sand depth 90 cm, flow rate 0.12 m/
hr, and influent arsenic concentration 1.0 mg / lit ) , sand produced
effluent arsenic level below the WHO guideline value for drinking water (
0.05 mg / l ) for 32 hr.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#83:1>
Among the different regenerant tested, 0.2 N NaOH was observed to be
most suitable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#84:1>
Vaishya and Agarwal ( 1993 ) also employed sand as sorption medium
for treating ground water containing low level of <mention> As ( <roman>
3</roman>) </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#85:1>
In batch experiments conducted at As ( III) concentrations of 0.1
- 1.6 mg / l at different sand doses of 5 - 40 g / l, the maximum removal was
observed to be 0.024 mg / g of sand. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#86:1>
<h> <bold> SILVER COATED-SAND FOR DOMESTIC WATER FILTER </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#87:1>
Silver which is known for its bacteriostatic and bactericidal
properties has also been coated on sand.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#88:1>
The Karachi laboratories of the <mention> Pakistan Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research </mention> ( PCSIR, 1985 ) developed
and tested several silver-based devices for the treatment of potable water in
the developing countries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#89:1>
The one most suitable for use in rural settings consists of nylon
bags with silver-coated sand.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#90:1>
Preliminary test with <it> <mention> Salmonelle typha </mention> ,
<mention> Escherichia coli </mention> , <mention> Shigella dysenteriae
</mention> </it> and <it> <mention> Staphylococcus spp. </mention> </it> have
indicated that there is a 90 % decrease in number of viable bacteria when
samples of experimentally contaminated water are filtered through the bags
at a flow rate of 1 l / min </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#91:1>
<h> <bold> IRON OXIDE-COATED SAND FOR REMOVAL AND RECOVERY OF HEAVY
METALS FROM WASTEWATER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-036#92:1>
Amorphous iron oxide ( ferrihydrite ) is an excellent regenerable
adsorbent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#93:1>
Studies have shown that ferrihydrite can remove copper, cadmium,
zinc, nickle and chromium from metal-plating wastes to levels lower than
that attainable by precipitation ( Edwards and Benjamin, 1989a ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#94:1>
Ferrihydrite is formed inconventional metal plating waste
treatment by precipitation of iron salts, which are often added to help
coagulate precipitated metal hydroxides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#95:1>
Metal removal by adsorption onto ferrihydrite is an important side
benefit of this practice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#96:1>
Since adsorption is not effective when large quantities of adsorbent
are present, a higher coagulant dose will improve treatment efficiency in
most cases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#97:1>
However, increasing the ferrihydrite concentration leads to a
corresponding increase in the sludge mass which adds substantially to the
cost of sludge disposal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#98:1>
To overcome this drawback, Edwards and Benjamin ( 1989b ) developed
methods of coating sand with iron oxide to produce an adsorbent with greater
flexibility of application, combining the advantages <O> <&> page </&> 584
</O> of adsorption and filtration processes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#99:1>
Depending on the solution pH, iron oxide-coated sand can adsorb
either cationic or anionic metals at alkaline and acidic pH, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-036#100:1>
Complexed and particulate forms of metals can also be efficiently
removed. </p> </I>
