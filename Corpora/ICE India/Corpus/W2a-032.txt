the city of Visakhapatnam was performed using an Energy Dispersive X-Ray
Fluorescence ( EDXRF ) system.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#4:1>
Similarly water and hair samples was studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#5:1>
The results of these investigations are reported and discussed in this

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#7:1>
Our earlier studies ( Sankara Rao <it> et al., </it> 1985 a and b;
Sree Krishna Murty <it> et al., </it> 1987 ) on trace element analysis in
aerosol samples of the industrial region of Visakhapatnam using a high
resolution EDXRF spectrometer have shown high levels of Pb and Zn which are
of toxic nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#8:1>
In these studies aerosol samples were collected during particular
hours of the day and a continuous sampling was not made to look for diurnal
and seasonal variations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#9:1>
In the present an attempt was made to look for diurnal and seasonal
variations in the trace element distribution in air particulate matter for
the years 1987 and 1988 by collecting aerosols continuously over a period of
20 hr in a day at different sites.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#10:1>
The preliminary results were reported in Sree Krishna Murty <it>
et al. </it> ( 1987 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#11:1>
We have also analysed trace elements in open well water samples
located in the industrial and non-industrial zones using energy
dispersive X-ray fluorescenee ( EDXRF ) method.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#12:1>
The results of this study were reported in Sree Krishna Murty <it> et
al. </it> ( 1988 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#13:1>
The human head hair samples collected from polluted and non pollured
areas were qualitatively analysed using the present technique.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#14:1>
The results of the analysis of different types of environmental
samples concerning the city of Visakhapatnam are correlated and discussed
in this paper. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#16:1>
<h> <bold> Sampling </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#17:1>
The aerosol samples were collected on TFA 41 and Whatman 541
glass fibre filter papers using a high volume air sampler at a height of 5 -
10 m from the ground level.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#18:1>
The sites where the air sampling was conducted are shown in the map
of city of Visakhapatnam ( Figure 1 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#19:1>
To study the diurnal variations in the aerosol composition, the
samples were collected continuously at time intervals of 4 hr and the same
was done in different seasons to look for seasonal variations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#20:1>
The volume of air collected at each place was of the order of 120
m<sp>3</sp>. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#21:1>
<h> <bold> EXPERIMENTATION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#22:1>
The EDXRF system used for the trace element analysis of
environmental samples was described in Sastry <it> et al. </it> ( 1984 ) and
Sankara Rao <it> et al. </it> ( 1985 a and b ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#23:1>
It is an integrated system comprising of a low power X-ray generator
( 25 W ) to excite the samples and a high resolution ( 160 eV at 5.9 keV )
detector system coupled to a microprocessor controlled multichannel
analyser.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#24:1>
The system was operated at a tube voltage of 25 KV and a tube
current of 100 <*> mu<*/>A.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#25:1>
The procedure followed for data collection, determination of net
characteristic X-ray intensities emitted by different trace elements in a
sample and the quantification of the characteristic X-ray intensities were
described in Sastry <it> et al. </it> ( 1984 ) and Sankara Rao <it> et al.
</it> ( 1985 a and b ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#26:1>
Typical characteristic X-ray spectra at a place called Mindi
Village surrounded by the industrial belt corresponding to winter and
summer months are shown in figures 2 and 3 respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#27:1>
These spectra are also due to a particular time interval in a day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#28:1>
The same for the Andhra University region which was taken as control
are given in figures 4 and 5 respectively. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#29:1>
<h> <bold> RESULT AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#30:1>
Ten aerosol samples were standardised at Air Monitoring
Section, BARC, Bombay using a <sp> 55</sp>Fe source which emits 5.9 keV K -
X-rays and X-ray tube fitted with a secondary target ( Mo ) which emits 17.44
keV X-rays as primary source of excitation for low Z and high Z elements,
respectively ( Sadasivan <O> <&> page </&> 935 </O> <O> figure 1. </O>
<O> caption </O> <O> two graphs ( figures 1 & 2 side by side </O> <O>
captions </O> <it> et al., </it> 1982 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#31:1>
Thin film standards namely, Ca, Fe and Pb were used as targets to
determine the product <mention> I<sb>0</sb>G </mention> , where <mention>
I<sb>0</sb> </mention> is the primary flux and <mention> G </mention> is the
geometrical factor in different regions of Z.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#32:1>
Necessary corrections for absorption in the sample and in the
filter paper were applied to get the net final intensities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#33:1>
Then, the elemental concentrations in different aerosol samples were
determined using the net characteristic X-ray intensities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#34:1>
They are summarized in tables 1 and 2 for the Mindi village and 3
and 4 for Andhra University.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#35:1>
These tables also include the meteorological parameters recorded
while sampling.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#36:1>

936 </O> <O> figure 4 ( graph) </O> <O> caption </O> <O> figure 5 ( graph)
</O> <O> caption </O> is of the order of 15 % which arrises out of counting

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#37:1>
The presence of high levels of Zn and Pb in aerosol samples is
attributed to the surrounding industries which are close to the site of
sampling.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#38:1>
The diurnal variations in the present case are due to the
atmospheric conditions like wind velocity and favourable wind directions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#39:1>
Thus, Zn and Pb may be regarded as of an anthropogenic origin.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#40:1>
The variations in the levels of Ca and Fe at different timings of the
day are mainly due to earth crustal dust raised into the atmosphere by the
vehicular traffic and winds.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#41:1>
It is also to be noted that the levels of Zn and Pb are high during
winter months when compared with those of summer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#42:1>
It is ascribed to increased fuel burning and local inversions which
lead to poorer dispersion of pollutants during the winter season ( Padmanabha
Murty <it> et al., </it> 1984; McDonald <it> et al., </it> 1979 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#43:1>
From tables 1 - 4 the high levels of Ca and Fe found in the aerosol
samples collected during summer months which are of earth crustal origin are
understood as due to heavy winds and vehicular traffic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#44:1>
From the tables 3 and 4 representing the control area it can be
seen that the concentrations of different trace elements are less than
those of industrial area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#45:1>
However, the trends in seasonal variations in the levels of Zn and
Pb are the same as those for the Industrial area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#46:1>
The diurnal variations in control area are found to be not
significant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#47:1>
From the present studies extending over a period of 3 year it is
found that the average of total suspended particulate matter of different
sites in Visakhapatnam is 160 <*> mu<*/>g / m<sp>3</sp> while the same ranges
from 140 to 540 <*> mu<*/>g / m<sp>3</sp> in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#48:1>
It is fonnd that 35 % of the air particulate matter during the winter
season accounts for the trace elemental composition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#49:1>
Thus, the unaccounted mass would consist of other major crustal
elements Na, Mg, Si, Al, O<sp>2</sp>, N<sp>2</sp> and in particular C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#50:1>
<h> <bold> WATER SAMPLES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#51:1>
The results on the trace element analysis of different ground
water samples collected from open wells <O> <&> page </&> 938 </O> belonging
to the city of Visakhapatnam were reported in Sree Krishna Murty <it> et al.
</it> ( 1988 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#52:1>
They show that the Pb levels are not only high in the samples of the
industrial zone but also in those at two remote sites free from
industries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#53:1>
The high levels of Pb in the water samples belonging to the
industrial region could be attributed to the Pb pollution in the aerosol
samples of this region.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#54:1>
The same at sites free from industries may be due to gasoline burning
because of heavy vehicular traffic and also may be in the well site itself.

<h> <bold> ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS OF HAIR SAMPLES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#56:1>
16 head hair sarnples belong to the people of Mulagado village
close to the city of Visakhapatnam and exposed to several industries were
collected and 17 of normals were also collected for the purpose of trace
element analysis using the present EDXRF technique.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#57:1>
The hair was thoroughly washed with mixture of acetone and de-ionised
water in the ratio of 3 : 1 and then dried.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#58:1>
The same was ashed and a few mg of each sample was uniformly spread
on a cello tape.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#59:1>
The samples were exposed to the primary source of exciting radiation
( X-ray generator ) and the data were collected as in the case of air and
water samples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#60:1>
Two typical XRF spectra are shown in figures 6 and 7 belonging to the
normal and the Mulagada village respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#61:1>
No quantification of the characteristic X-ray intensities emitted
by each element in a hair sample could be done because of the
non-availability of a suitable hair standard.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#62:1>
However, the characteristic X-ray intensities were computed in the
usual manner.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#63:1>
From figures 6 and 7 it can be seen that the characteristic X-ray
intensities of Pb from the industrial sample is higher than that from the
normal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#64:1>
The average characteristic X-ray intensities for the hair samples
from the polluted and non-polluted regions are given below :

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#65:1>
Average Pb X - ray intensity of belongs to normals people = 151 <*>
plus or minus</*> 31

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#66:1>
Average Pb X-ray intensity of belongs to inhabitants exposed to
pollution = 4565 <*> plus or minus</*> 97 </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#67:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-032#68:1>
The present trace element analysis of environmental samples shows
that the lead levels in general are high in the industrial region of the city
of Visakhapatnam.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#69:1>
Our earlier analysis ( Sankara Roo <it> et al., </it> 1986 ) of 200
blood samples of the inhabitants <O> ( figures 6 & 7) graphs </O> <O>
captions </O> of Mindi village have shown low Fe levels in 164 samples
indicating anaemic condition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#70:1>
Pb pollution is likely to interfere with haemglobin synthesis
process.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#71:1>
However, malnutrition could also be one of the reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-032#72:1>
A social survey of this region will give an idea about the real
situation. </p>
