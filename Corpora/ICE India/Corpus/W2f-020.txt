She was sitting with him in her drawing room, protectively
ensconced in her favourite chair in a corner, a warm, deep, plush sofa
into which she would snuggle like she never did with anyone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#8:1>
She was nearing thirty, more than twelve years married, but without
love.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#9:1>
She sat up. </p>

He was sitting across the room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#21:1>
He kept sitting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#22:1>
Trapped by the otherness of his position.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#23:1>
She was so nervous.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#24:1>
But she had never known what it was to take solace in the arms of a
man.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#25:1>
So it didn't occur to her that she could do so now or that she should
even want to.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#26:1>
Wasn't it enough that he should be there, his presence wafting
towards her like a soft breeze from across the room?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#27:1>
She could not see his eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#28:1>
This time it was his voice which filled her body and mingled with her
tears. </p>

<quote> " Shreya, Shreya, Shreya," </quote> he repeated her name
softly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#30:1>
It was like an averment that yearned its way to her from that
distance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#31:1>
He did not move.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#32:1>
He did not get up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#33:1>
But his voice was like a physical call whose touch she could feel,
not just hear.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#34:1>
She trembled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#35:1>
She did not look at him. </p>

He came and stood near her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#57:1>
She looked at him, the tears flowing onto her full, blood red lips.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#58:1>
the stillness between them was like the flames of the ritual
<indig> havan </indig> or fire which sear the worshipping bodies arranged
around it. <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#59:1>
Shreya felt her body dissolving into those flames and again, once
again, the incense rose from her pores and enveloped her as she looked at
him through that aromatic haze.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#60:1>
Her lips rose to his, his breath must smell like roses, she thought,
it must smell like roses <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#61:1>
It did, it did. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#62:1>
The telephone screeched through the stillness like a
murdering shriek in the night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#63:1>
It was Brijesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#64:1>
Cold, matter of fact, his voice as blank as his eyes, informing her
that he would not be home for dinner. </p>

Anand had not brought his driver or the escort who normally
accompanies the Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate wherever he
travels in his district.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#68:1>
The D.C. in his town is like a minister in a state capital, easly
recognizable, the object of constant gossip and speculation whose
private life and personal habits are like the ingredients for a heady
cocktail which are mixed, shaken and drunk by an eager populace.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#69:1>
While held in awe for the supreme authority he wields, he is
totally vulnerable to the machinations of local political bosses who, if he
is too strict and unresponsive to their personal recommendattions, start
nibbling away at his reputation to the point of causing such
bureaucratic embarrassment that he has to be transferred out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#70:1>
In the final analysis the politician emerges, as the winner, even if
it is at the cost of the implementation of his own declared public
policies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#71:1>
The Indian Administrative Service cadre has an in-built security
system provided in the constitution however that gives it a staying power and
resilence which cannot be destroyed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#72:1>
Only harrassment can weaken its will or dilute its idealism, never
the prospect of dismissal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#73:1>
Shreya had been in Lucknow long enough and also been active
enough to perceive that <O> in column no. five in the middle tantalizer 1
</O> <O> PUBLISHED BY UBS PUBLISHERS DISTRIBUTORS LTD. PRICE RS 125. P.P. 310
</O> <O> <&> page ( not numbered) </&> 77 </O> <&> in column one in the
midddle tantalizer 2 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#74:1>
Anand was known to temper his Independence of spirit, his zest for
efficiency and resistance to political manoeuvrebilities with a
sobriety and understanding that had ensured him the good will, if not the
compliance of his subordinates and a certain degree of cooperation from
the politicians.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#75:1>
She had gleaned this from the stray comments she heard, and of
course, from the unity of reaction both of the underpriviledged class like
the servants and those right up the ladder who were close to the chief
minister whom she had seen on occasions looking at Anand with seasoned
opproval.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#76:1>
Perhaps this <O> drawing spread over column 1 & 2 </O> was because
the chief minister in U.P. was also, like Anand, a Brahmin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#77:1>
Hari Prasad Trivedi was only in his forties but not above extracting
his dose of conventional obeisance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#78:1>
Both temporal power and a sense of Brahmanical superiority
combined in him to produce an attitude of mind which expected young and
old to touch his feet as a routine gesture.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#79:1>
And they did, thrusting their hands down to the ground just above his
feet when he was standing and bending low over his knees if he were
sitting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#80:1>
Sometimes she would see him push his foot forward almost
involuntarily as soon as someone came near him, so habituated was he to this
practice and so confident in his expectation of this act of reverent
genuflexion from his worshipping subjects which included even officers
belonging to the state service. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#81:1>
Shreya saw that Anand maiantained his official aloofness as a
member of the privileged Indian Administrative Service or perhaps took
shelter behind it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#82:1>
He reminded her a litle of her father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#83:1>
There was the same arrogant tilt of the head and at times the same
milish refusal to budge from a stand taken in full faith against political
interference or pressure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#84:1>
His rapport with the people gave additi nal credibility to his
position.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#85:1>
The thought that he could even be posted away as a punishment
therefore had never occurred to Shreya.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#86:1>
Nor did she have the apprehension that if she were to be seen
alone in his house in the evening it would lead to a scandal and that his
image would suffer as a consequence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#87:1>
It was she who was also vulnerable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#88:1>
But she didnot think of that either.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#89:1>
She did not feel married.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#90:1>
She felt untouched, pure, virginal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#91:1>
She did not feel she was going to <w> Anand's </w> house alone as a
married woman, the wife of Brijesh with the blank eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#92:1>
She felt she was going as Shreya, virgin and free, even if she had a
husband and three children.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#93:1>
Her body was afire without her knowing why. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#94:1>
Later, she shook with gusts of awareness, again and again, the
wind ripping through the defending branches of her body and leaving her bare,
born anew, a beloved.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#95:1>
Each time at the mere thought of what was happening to her body would
ripple like the suddenly excited waters of a tranquil pond.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#96:1>
She would feel the tremors running like spirits all through her
veins.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#97:1>
She could not believe that the face she saw above hers as she lay on
his bed was actually his and that, at last, no shadows lay between.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#98:1>
They were one, the smells and the sounds of a dream, and the reality
that pierced her with the black of its burning eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#99:1>
She could no longer distinguish between the fires that flamed in
her heart and the fires that leapt in her limbs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#100:1>
Was this love, or whatever it was?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#101:1>
She did not know.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#102:1>
Shreya could not think. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#103:1>
She could only react to the winds that ripped through, the
waters that rippled, the tremors that shook her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#104:1>
She was like a person who had been dosed with slow poison, numbed
into lethargy and the gradual demoralisation of the senses and was now
caught in violent seizures that tore her from her reserves.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#105:1>
Her eyes flew wide open, her mouth, her legs, her heart, were opened
to receive, each pore an open receptacle for the showers of ecstasy that
rained down upon her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#109:1>
She had fallen asleep.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#110:1>
For the first time in the arms of a man.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#111:1>
Never once in all those years with Brijest had this happened
despite his earnest and persistent efforts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#112:1>
Poor kind, brown eyed husband, thought Shreya, drowsily.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#113:1>
Never to have known this fever, never to have been loved.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#114:1>
Poor brown eyes, poor, kind Brijesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#115:1>
Poor Brijesh, poor Brijesh, poor Brijesh <*> dotted line</*> hunched
in shoulders shrunk over indeterminate breasts, no, no, that was her, not
him, she, with her disused nipples which were now pushing their way into her
consciousness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#116:1>
Poor Brijesh, poor husband with no nipples but a persistent cock
that crowed and crowed in vain <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#117:1>
She sat up in a panic.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#118:1>
She couldn't face him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#119:1>
What would she say?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#120:1>
She was drenched in ecstasy, it was spilled all over her, it would
be there with its heavy monsoon shower from him to see, see that she was not
the same as before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#121:1>
She clung to Anand in panic.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#122:1>
I can't, I don't want to, I can't <*> dotted line</*> go with
another face, I can't.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#123:1>
Please. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#124:1>
Brijesh was not at home when Anand dropped her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#125:1>
She went and flung herself on her bed, her first and permanent
refuge, then burrowed into it, hiding from herself, from him, from that
<*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#126:1>
But the more she snuggled into herself the more conscious did she
become of that other and soon the incense began to rise from her body, rising
and enveloping her and sucking her into its sensusous cloud.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#127:1>
Brijesh found her like that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#128:1>
She looked so ready, so pliable, in a daze, so warm <*> dotted
line</*> the Shreya of his dreams, in a drunken daze, so full of her own
ecstasy that no cries of her old protests came to her when he slid in with
her and into her and she swam again and again with him in a sea of
receptivity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#129:1>
Oh Shreya, oh Shreya, oh Shreya, the voice of her husband cried over
the sea of faces that mingled in her eyes and the gentle waves that lapped
over her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#130:1>
There was nothing except the sea in her body and all of the secrets
of its heady movements opening up to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#131:1>
Shreya, Shreya, she heard her <w> husband's </w> <O> <&> page
</&> 78 </O> <O> <&> column N. one, tantalizer 2 in the middle </O> voice
whisper in wondering delight and slowly as the waves receded, without a
ward, a murmur, a protest, Shreya sank into sleep. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#132:1>
She hated him when she woke up the next morning and found him
looking at her with the milky tenderness in his eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#133:1>
She was appalled of what had happened.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#134:1>
She had never felt with Anand that she had betrayed her marriage.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#135:1>
She felt now with her husband that she had betrayed her love or
whatever that was.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#136:1>
It should have been the other way round.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#137:1>
The hate in her was like rapids in her bloodstream, jostling,
crashing, tumbling and running for outlets.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#138:1>
She shut her yes so that he should not see the hate in them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#139:1>
Her head swam in a haze of moral confusion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#140:1>
What was right?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#141:1>
What was wrong?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#142:1>
What had she done?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#143:1>
What had happened to her?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#144:1>
If he touches me, <w> I'll </w> scream.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#145:1>
She slipped a veil of blankness over her eyes when she looked back
at him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#146:1>
<quote> " Shreya <*> dotted line</*>" </quote> he hesitated.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#147:1>
I hate him, she thought.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#148:1>
He had no business to defile me with this, with his gentleness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#149:1>
<w> He's </w> always doing that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#150:1>
Defiling me with that gentle brown in his eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#151:1>
He was standing still, in front of her, his arms hanging straight
down on either side.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#152:1>
He was not going to move towards her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#153:1>
He was still and quiet and helpless in his desire for her
response.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#154:1>
And patient.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#155:1>
And glowing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#158:1>
She felt sick.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#159:1>
The red in her cheeks flared up to match her lips.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#160:1>
She turned her face away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#161:1>
What had she done! <O> drawing </O> <O> caption </O> what had he
done?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#162:1>
Used her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#163:1>
Found her ready and warm with Anand, oh Anand - - and used her with
his horrible gentleness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#164:1>
I hate him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#165:1>
I hate him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#166:1>
I hate him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#167:1>
She kept quiet, with her head lowered demurely in front of him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#168:1>
I - I have become like her, she thought fearfully.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#169:1>
Like Zahida, the prostitute, with her many men.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#170:1>
What have I done?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#171:1>
She who had no desires, only vague stirrings, she, who didn't even
know what love was, she, who was so normal, so ordinary that nothing
extraordinary could be accommodated in the routine grooves of her mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#172:1>
What have I done?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#173:1>
What has happened to me?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#174:1>
No, it was not Brijesh, her husband, not the man with the kind,
brown eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#175:1>
No, I can't hate him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#176:1>
It is him, with the incense and the black in his eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#177:1>
It was the incense, it was him, it was the black in those eyes; her
heart kept pounding this refrain beneath her hunched in breasts and her
lowered lids.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#178:1>
It is he who has done this, he, Anand, not this kind man with his
gentle, brown looks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#179:1>
It was love <*> dotted line</*> was that love, or whatever it was?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#180:1>
I can't hate love, can I?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#181:1>
I can't hate love. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#182:1>
Somewhere, inside her, fear took root in a panic seed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#183:1>
She became aware of the accountable threat to her marriage.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#184:1>
Brijesh was marriage, safe, Anand was love, unpredictable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#185:1>
She could not think, no, she wouldn't think.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#186:1>
She couldn't let Brijesh touch her, she would not look at him, she
was afraid it would show in her eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#187:1>
She did not want him, she did not want him, she did not want to lose
him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#188:1>
Suddenly she knew what she had to do.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#189:1>
Take refuge in her pretensions agains, felgn the physical pain that
had never been there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#190:1>
She looked up at him helplessly and slowly her face began to move to
the contortions dictated by her imagination, with the stomach beginning
to churn at the thought of those cold thrusts in her vagina she was so afraid
of, no, not cold any more.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#191:1>
Even he must know, she thought in panic, even he must know that
there was a mask out there between her legs <*> dotted line</*> </p>

<quote> " Oh," </quote> she doubled up, <quote> " its c-come ag-
again, m-my stomach - - " </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#193:1>
It was there, the pain was real, she was so afraid, she could
feel it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#194:1>
At least it was in the stomach, not in that hot, clammy centre,
where she would usually get it or feel it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#195:1>
Hadn't she called out with pain the night before?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#196:1>
Hadn't she felt it through the dazed experience of that awful
repeat?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#197:1>
Had she or had she not?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#198:1>
She could not let it happen again, she couldn't.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#199:1>
She shut her eyes and groaned.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#200:1>
She did not realise that for the first time, the onset of a tantrum
or her declared agony had not brought Brijesh running to her with
concern.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#201:1>
She looked up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#202:1>
He had gone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#203:1>
Shreya was so shocked that she forgot she was supposed to be in
pain.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#204:1>
She sat up, like a puppet that is suddenly jerked to perform.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#205:1>
She could not even call out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#206:1>
She had never, like a true traditonal Indian wife, called her
husband by his name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#207:1>
The husband with no name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#208:1>
<w> That's </w> whom she had been married to.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#209:1>
So she had found a l-lover w-with a n-name, Anand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#210:1>
She clamped her head with her hands to stop the throbbing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#211:1>
Anand, Anand, Anand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#212:1>
Perhaps she should call out to her husband by his name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#213:1>
Would he then become a l-lover and m-make the incense rise from
her b-body?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#214:1>
She tried to form the word <mention> B-r-i-j-e-s-h.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#215:1>
She faltered </mention> , she stumbled on each consonant, on each
vowel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#216:1>
No sound emerged from her being.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#217:1>
He couldn't become real, this husband without a name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#218:1>
She got up from the bed and ran out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#219:1>
He was nowhere in the house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#220:1>
She stood panicked into stillness, her pulse beating a nervous
tattoo in her body.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#221:1>
Where could she go now?

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#222:1>
What would happen? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#223:1>
She was so frightened that she rang up Anand. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#224:1>
<quote> " A-n-a-n-d." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-020#225:1>
She could say it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#226:1>
Anand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#227:1>
The nervous rhythm of her heart steadied to an even beat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#228:1>
A-n-a-n-d.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#229:1>
She could call him by his name.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#230:1>
Did that mean he could never be her husband? </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#244:1>
The telephone screeched through the stillness like a murdering
shriek in the night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#245:1>
It was Brijesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#246:1>

Brijesh was not at home when Anand dropped her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#248:1>
She went and flung herself on her bed, her first and <O> drawing
</O> permanent refuge, then burrowed into it, hiding from herself, from him,
from that <*> dotted line</*> <&> tantalizer 3 on page 79 column number one

He had no business to defile me with this, with his gentleness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-020#251:1>
<w> He's </w> always doing that.
