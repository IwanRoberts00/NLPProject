<h> Only way to cut Gulf air fares </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#33:2>

<@PR> TRIVANDRUM {#}, <@DR> Jan. 6 {#}

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#36:2>
THE clamour for reduction of Air- <w> India's </w> fare on the
Trivandrum-Gulf sector is unlikely to yield much till Trivandrum is
given the <quote> ` international' </quote> status, or foreign airlines,
particularly the Gulf ones, are allowed to land here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#37:2>
Ever since the Trivandrum-Gulf operations of Air-India were
launched over a decade ago, there have been demands to reduce the fares.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#38:2>
The proponents of fare reduction, like the <quote> `
Gulf-Trivandrum airfare forum' </quote> , a Dubai-based outfit formed
recently to fight for the demand, point out that though the direct
Trivandrum-gulf service does not come to Bombay, they are charged for that
distance too. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#39:2>
The flown distance from Trivandrum to Delhi direct is 2,963
kms while from Bombay to Dubai it is 1,935 kms.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#40:2>
If the plane were to cover the Trivandrum-Bombay distance, for which
fare is collected from the passengers from Trivandrum, it would have flown
3,205 kms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#41:2>
In effect, therefore, the Trivandrum-Dubai passenger <}> <->
which </-> <+> who </+> </}> flies direct pays for the 242 kms he does not
travel, the pro-fare-cut lobby contends. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#42:2>
Informed sources in the airlines say that the Gulf sector fare
was calculated basing Bombay and Delhi as the <quote> " gateway points"
</quote> and for any travel from Bombay/Delhi to any other point within the
country the fare was added on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#43:2>
A highly-placed Air-India official here, who sought anonymity,
told the TOINS that it was erroneous to look at things in pure distance
terms.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#44:2>
He pointed out that the aircraft cannot take short cuts and fly
whichever route they want.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#45:2>
They will have to fly through certain air corridors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#46:2>
In any case, the Trivandrum-Dubai passenger by the direct flight
reaches his destination earlier with less botheration, he added.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#47:2>
If the passenger was to take a flight via Bombay he would have to,
among other things, wait for hours to catch the next flight to his
destination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#48:2>
<quote> " In fact, we should be slapping a surcharge for reaching
them early but we do not because we are bound by IATA ( International Air
Transport Association) fares," </quote> he reasoned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#49:2>
The official pointed out that Air-India was in no position to
reduce the fares unilaterally because it was guided by IATA fares and
bilateral agreements.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#50:2>
It is not that Air-India does not want to do anything.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#51:2>
<X> <quote> " <*> dotted-line</*>.As regards the reduction of fares,
the government of India has informed that air fares on the Gulf-India route
have been fixed unanimously by all the concerned countries at the IATA forum
and approved by the concerned governments.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#X52:2>
The Union government has stated that it is therefore neither
possible nor permissible for Air-India to unilaterally charge lower fares <*>
dotted-line</*>" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#53:2>
The <quote> ` Gulf-Trivandrum-air-fare forum' </quote> does not
agree.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#54:2>
It is the representatives of different airlines operating in the same
sector which formulate a fare, it feels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#55:2>
To the forum, <w> IATA's </w> role was only to send the
formulated fare to the governments concerned for approval and then publish
them after the approval is got. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#56:2>
It reasons that since the Trivandrum-Gulf sector was the
<quote> " monopoly" </quote> of Air-India there was no question of a
formulated fare or the IATA coming into the picture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#57:2>
According to Air-India, any unilateral cut in fares, if at all
that was possible, would result in the Gulf countries closing their doors to
our carriers because the business of their national carriers would be badly
hit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#58:2>
Gulf Air alone operates at least 26 flights a week to the Gulf
from Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#59:2>
It also has six from Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#60:2>
Then there are the Emirates, Saudia, Cathay Pacific, Kuwait, Syrian
Arab Airlines etc, operating in the gulf sector from Bombay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#61:2>
Therefore, in the event of a fare reduction, the government will
have to willy nilly throw open Trivandrum airport to at least the Gulf
carriers and allow them to compete for the Keralite passenger who accounts
for the bulk of the Gulf traffic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#62:2>
Proponents of the fare reduction feel that once Trivandrum was
opened to the foreign airlines Air- <w> India's </w> monopoly would be
threatened.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#63:2>
Also, it would have to pull up its socks and improve its <quote> "
none-too-impressive" </quote> service if it wanted to be in the hunt.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#64:2>
They also contended that Air-India had burnt its fingers by allowing
certain foreign carriers to operate in areas which hitherto were its
monopoly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#65:2>
In essence, Air-India has a vested interest in not allowing
forcing airlines to land in Trivandrum, the pro-cut lobby alleges. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#66:2>
The Bombay hotel lobby is also said to be interested in seeing
that Trivandrum airport does not get an international status.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#67:2>
For, it is argued, passengers from Trivandrum to the Gulf via Bombay
alone account for an estimated 600 rooms a day.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#68:2>
Also, most of the passengers do not occupy the rooms for more than
10-12 hours because they have to fly out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#69:2>
This naturally benefits the hotels more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#70:2>
Another argument for seeking reduction in fare is that the per
kilometre rate on the Dubai-Trivandrum-Dubai sector was three times
more compared to the Bombay-New-York-Bombay sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#71:2>
Similarly, it is pointed out, that the per kilometre rate on the
Bombay-London-Bombay and Dubai-Bombay-Singapore-Bombay-Dubai sectors
were cheaper compared to the Dubai-Trivandrum-Dubai sector.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#72:2>
Air-India, for its part, argues that it is the short-distance
passenger who invariably subsidised the long-distance passenger.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#73:2>
And it was not true only in the case of airlines but also with any
mode of transport, it is reasoned. </p> </I>

<h> Commerzbank plans to enlarge Indian operations </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#75:3>
<bold> By Our <@AS> Financial Editor {#} </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#76:3>
<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> January 12 {#}:
Commerzbank, one of West <w> Germany's </w> big three banks, has
opened a representative office in Bombay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#77:3>
According to Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, member of the board of
managing directors of Commerzbank AG, the office in Bombay will offer
Indian and German clients a broad range of assistance, including consultancy
services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#78:3>
The Bombay office will serve as an intermediary for Indian
corporations seeking to tap either the German or World capital markets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#79:3>
Talking after the formal opening of the representative office, Mr
Kohlhaussen said that over many decades the bank had been actively involved
in building and strengthening the economic ties between India and Germany.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#80:3>
It had played a key role in handling Indo-German trade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#81:3>
He said the bank had been very active in arranging bond issues
and syndicated loans for Indian borrowers, especially in the Deutsche Mark
sector.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#82:3>
It was instrumental in opening up the Euro-DM market for Indian
borrowers and had handled numerous deals for borrowers like Industrial
Development Bank of India, Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Steel
Authority of India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#83:3>
He said with the office in Bombay, the bank should be able to
reinforce its position as an intermediary for offering Indian companies more
than its century-old expertise in global fund raising.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#84:3>
It would also help entrepreneurs from both the countries intending
to set up joint ventures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#85:3>
At the end of October 1989, the <w> bank's </w> consolidated
business volume totalled 200 billion DM ( around Rs 160,000 <indig> crores
</indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#86:3>
The <w> bank's </w> substantial international commitment is
reflected by its worldwide presence extending to some 70 foreign outlets, and
holdings in over 30 countries, with a network of 900 offices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#87:3>
Referring to the <w> bank's </w> role after the recent events in
Eastern Europe, Mr Kohlhaussen said that the bank would open an office in
East Berlin soon.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#88:3>
It was contemplating to have offices in Budapest and Warsaw. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#89:3>
He said banks in Western Europe were watching the situation
carefully.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#90:3>
German banks would be very much interested in having a focus on
Eastern Europe in general and East Germany in particular.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#91:3>
However, his <}> <-> banks </-> <+> <w> bank's </w> </+> </}>
interest in this region would not result in reducing its commitments to
the rest of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#92:3>
He felt that private investment was attracted to the regions
which provided best attractions in terms of legal and political environment
and availability of technical manpower. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#93:3>
He felt that India should have ongoing process of
liberalisation to continue to attract more direct foreign investment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-003#94:3>
Referring to international banking field, he said DM would be
stronger as a currency.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#95:3>
In the first half of 1990, he did not expect any slow down in the
German economy.

<ICE-IND:W2C-003#96:3>
Interest rates in U.S. might go down in the short run. </p> </I>
