 <bold> W</bold><smallcaps>HEN</smallcaps> I started my career in
Calcutta in 1951, I was drawing a salary of Rs. 1,050 per month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#6:1>
 With this money I had a comfortable living.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#7:1>
 I could pay the rent of my flat which was Rs. I25 per month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#8:1>
 I could afford a servant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#9:1>
 I bought a secondhand car and ran it by employing a driver and
above all, I sent my brother to UK for higher studies by remitting him
<indig> Rs. </indig> 400 per month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#10:1>
 During the last 40 years things have changed drastically and we have
been faced with unprecedented inflation which we all know has been caused by
many factors such as high degree of deficit financing, increased
population and shortage of goods and services not matching the demand.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#11:1>
 In other words, <quote> ` too much money is chasing too few goods and
services.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#12:1>
 Over and above all this, there is considerable waste of the
available resources such as men, money and materials which are not put to
optimum use. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#13:1>
 <h> <bold> Impact of Inflation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#14:1>
 Efforts of the various agencies both governmental and private
including the National Productivity Councils did not have the desired effect
in increasing the availability of goods and services to check inflation
within a reasonable limit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#15:1>
 Today we have to face reality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#16:1>
 Inflation is there which means heavy overrun in the <O> <*> line in
column</*>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#17:1>
 * <footnote> The author is a member of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India. </footnote> </O> cost of various projects
necessitating more finances and deficit financing still further.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#18:1>
 We have to find ways and means to beat inflation so that its
impact is reduced.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#19:1>
 It will not be possible to mitigate it altogether.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#20:1>
 Government needs money to finance its various five-year plans and has
to resort to heavy deficit financing year after year thus pumping Rs.
8,000 to Rs. 10,000 crores every year in the economy of the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#21:1>
 From my work experience of 40 years in various industries and
profession, I feel that there is urgent need to control waste in various
spheres of economy which will help reduce the impact of inflation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#22:1>
 In other words, we need to ensure optimum use of our resources.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#23:1>
 <h> <bold> Waste Control - - Personal Situations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#24:1>
 In the personal sphere I can cite the examples like the use of
car, electricity, gas etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#25:1>
 It is possible to get greater value from the same quantity of petrol
if the visits are properly planned.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#26:1>
 Before starting, a mental planning is to be made of the various
places to be visited in a row so there is no overlapping.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#27:1>
 It is my experience that considerable amount of saving in petrol
consumption is possible at a time when its price is very high and also
there is acute shortage in the country necessitating the need for its
conservation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#28:1>
 Similarly, there is scarcity of electricity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#29:1>
 If public is educated to use austerity and put off switches of
lights, fans, air-conditioners etc., after there use, a certain amount of
saving is possible in electricity consumption which otherwise is in short
supply.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#30:1>
 Whatever electricity is thus saved can be made available for use in
factories, farms etc., to help increase production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#31:1>
 My experience with LPG cylinder is that in a normal household
it can work up to 40 days with a little care, but it can finish in 20 / 22
days if not handled carefully.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#32:1>
 The wastage can be controlled with a little care. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#33:1>
 There can be many more instances where wastage occurs and this
needs to be controlled with a little effort, thus partly mitigating the
impact of inflation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#34:1>
 <h> <bold> Waste Control - - Industrial Situations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#35:1>
 During my 40 years of service in industry, I have come across a
number of cases where industry flourished when it controlled waste and
it went to dogs when there was no such control. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#36:1>
 <h> <it> Improving Design </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#37:1>
 My company used to construct pile foundations for multistoreyed
tall and heavy buildings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#38:1>
 The piles were designed to carry load of 100 tonnes each.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#39:1>
 In order to ensure that the piles did not fail after construction
they were tested to a load of 200 tonnes each.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#40:1>
 It was soon discovered that the safety margin of 100 % was <O> <&>
page </&> 721 </O> unwarranted as our competitors started undercutting us by
providing a safety margin of 50 % only which was acceptable to the customers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#41:1>
 Ultimately, my company also decided to reduce the safety margin to
the extent acceptable to the customers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#42:1>
 My general manager who was a Scotsman used to say: <quote> " Why give
a Rolls Royce where Morris Minor can do." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#43:1>
 The wastage was not apparent, but was in the design and if not
corrected in time could have put the company to heavy losses and driven it
out of the business. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#44:1>
 As much as 26,000 tonnes of steel was used in the construction of
Howrah bridge in early 40s, but only 12,000 tonnes of steel was used in the
construction of Mokameh Bridge ( now Rajender Pul ) in Bihar in 1959 which is
not only double decker but is four times the length of Howrah bridge.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#45:1>
 My company finished the construction of the bridge well ahead of the
schedule with proper planning and earned profit much more than originally
budgeted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#46:1>
 Saving in steel was due to improved design. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#47:1>
 <h> <it> Better Logistics </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#48:1>
 It is imperative in any construction project that there is
regular flow of materials to the works place so that the labour and plant are
not kept idle.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#49:1>
 Any idle labour and/or plant has always added losses to the
business. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#50:1>
 In yet another case my company used to manufacture, supply and
erect Water Treatment Plants for the private and public sector clients.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#51:1>
 It was a practice with the company to despatch monthly whatever
equipment was manufactured so that it could claim 90 % advance payment from
its clients.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#52:1>
 The erection engineer would visit the site after the last
instalment was despatched.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#53:1>
 On reaching the site, he would find to his horror that half the
equipment was not traceable at the site.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#54:1>
 The client would not accept any responsibility for the missing
equipment as he had placed a firm order for the complete supply of equipment
including erection and guaranteed output.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#55:1>
 This would mean that the company had to supply the missing parts for
the second time which would add to its costs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#56:1>
 The site engineer who would in the normal course have completed the
job in a fortnight was forced to stay at the site for more than three months
with the result that the company instead of making profit made heavy
losses and also made itself liable for penalty for not completing the job in
stipulated time.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#57:1>
 This was the position with almost all the jobs and the management was
worried about the mounting losses.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#58:1>
 When I took over the charge of the unit, I studied the problem in all
its aspects and came to the conclusion that material would not be despatched
to the site in piecemeal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#59:1>
 Instead, they would be kept in the works till all the parts are
manufactured and then sent to site under the supervision of the engineer
responsible for completion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#60:1>
 Although it meant a temporary loss to the company in not being able
to claim 90 % advance payment, it was fully compensated by turning the loss
making job into profit making jobs. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#61:1>
 <h> <it> Be Fair and Firm </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#62:1>
 When I started my career in a professional firm in Calcutta,
one of the senior partners who was dealing with staff matters told me in the
lift just before I was to join a commercial company; <quote> ` Mittal, you
will have to deal with labour in your new assignment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#63:1>
 Be fair and firm.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#64:1>
 Till date I have not forgotten his advice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#65:1>
 I had to deal with staff and labour matter in all my working life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#66:1>
 It was not always easy and there were many anxious moments but his
advice stood the test of time.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#67:1>
 In my first job we used to undertake big construction jobs involving
thousands of contract Iabour.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#68:1>
 Every problem was resolved through negotiations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#69:1>
 Not that we met all their demands but it was a process of give and
take.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#70:1>
 All the projects were completed satisfactorily.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#71:1>
 In my second job it was a large mining company and its labour
strength was almost 10,000.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#72:1>
 Before I took charge of the company I was told that it was a
difficult posting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#73:1>
 I was told that every year 7 to 10 deaths took place due to
inter-union rivalry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#74:1>
 I was in charge for 12 years and I can say with satisfaction that
during those 12 years, not a single working day was lost due to strike, go
slow and / or lock-out.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#75:1>
 What I did was that I would call the union for discussion at the
first indication of trouble and the problems were always sorted out across
the table. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#76:1>
 <h> <it> Where there is a Will, there is a Way </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-011#77:1>
 My company used to enter into long-term contracts of, say, 10
years or more duration with steel plants for supply of essential raw
materials and these contracts included escalation clauses to cover
increases in costs that may occur during the course of the contracts due to
circumstances beyond the control of the company such as statutory imposition
etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#78:1>
 One such increase took place when payment of Bonus Act was enacted
in l965 and it imposed liability on employers for payment to its employees
a minimum bonus initially @ 4 % of the annual salary/wages and later on
increased to 8.33 % irrespective of the fact whether the employer has any
distributable surplus or not.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#79:1>
 When I took charge of the affairs of the company in 1969 I studied
the contracts with particular reference to the Escalation Clause and it
became clear to me that the additional liability for minimum bonus was a
justifiable claim against the steel plants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#80:1>
 Similarly, the payment of Gratuity Act imposed liability on
employers for payment of gratuity to all its employees who have done service
of five years or more at the time of their leaving the employment at the rate
of 15 days salary / wages last drawn for each year of service.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#81:1>
 This was applicable to all existing and future employees.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#82:1>
 It imposed a very heavy burden on my company employing almost 10,000
employees which the company was finding it beyond its means to carry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#83:1>
 I approached the Chairman of my company and told him that we had a
clear case, according to my thinking, for passing on the additional burden
of the payments of bonus and gratuity to the steel plants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#84:1>
 He dissuaded me by saying that no steel plant would ever accept
our claim and suggested that I should rather forget about this issue.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#85:1>
 I explained to him that the situation would not be any worse by
taking up the matter with them as in any case we were not getting any
reimbursement from them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#86:1>
 He reluctantly agreed that I might get some good legal advice before
approaching the clients.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#87:1>
 I contacted the local lawyer whose advice was that there was a
possibility of getting our claims admitted from the clients under the
existing contracts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#88:1>
 I requested the legal advisor of the company to probe the matter
still further and if possible to get the expert advice from the eminent
jurist Mr. N.A. Palkhivala at Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#89:1>
 He prepared the requisite brief, made an appointment with Mr.
Palkhivala and we went to <O> ( Continued on page 728) </O> <O> <&> page </&>
722 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#90:1>
 <h> <bold> Resources Management and Waste Control </bold> </h> <O>
<&> ( Contd. from page 722) </&> </O> Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#91:1>
 As Mr. Palkhivala was associated with the Tatas, he asked whether his
interpretation of the contract would in any way affect <mention> TISCO
</mention> and we replied in the affirmative.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#92:1>
 Then he asked for a letter signed by the Chairman of our company
saying that whatever advice whether in our favour or against us would be
binding on us with regard to the contract with <mention> TlSCO </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#93:1>
 The letter signed by our Chairman was duly given.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#94:1>
 After a few months we got his written advice and he opined in no
uncertain terms that the payment of minimum bonus and gratuity liability were
elements of costs and were payable by the steel plants under the terms of the
contract.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#95:1>
 The Company submitted its claims supported by the legal opinion
and we were able to mobilise <indig> lakhs </indig> of rupees from steel
plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-011#96:1>
 Minimum bonus and gratuity were included as elements of cost in all
future price negotiations. </p> </I>
