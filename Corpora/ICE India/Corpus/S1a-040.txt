Hi Tina

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#2:1:B>
Hi Jenny

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#3:1:A>
How was your journey Tina from Harihar

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#4:1:B>
Oh God I can't tell you it was terrible you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#5:1:A>
What happened <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#6:1:B>
The students from <,> the Ranebennur College you know <,> <w>
they're </w> having <,> problem for conveyance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#7:1:B>
So they stopped all these buses

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#8:1:A>
All

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-040#9:1:B>
Only government buses uhn K S R T C buses <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#10:1:B>
And then my God you can't <,,> they were throwing stones <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#11:1:B>
And I was sitting in the bus near the window you can't believe it I
was so terrified by this <,,> the <O> one or two words </O> <,> down and then
uh <,> some fellow <,> he came and he said </quote> don't worry if anything
happens like that <w> I'll </w> take you home </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#12:1:B>
And then the whole bus went back to this <.> kum </.> Kumarapatnam
police station <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#13:1:B>
And then they stopped over there and then I wanted to ring up daddy
from there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#14:1:B>
But then I thought if I ring him up then again <w> he'll </w> take
me back home and then I have to come back tomorrow another day <w> I'll </w>
be wasting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#15:1:B>
So what I did <,> I just sat there for one hour and three hours
there in that <,> village you know in middle of nowhere and <w> there's </w>
nothing to eat also that was the worst part and I thought mostly <w> they'll
</w> reach home in the night <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#16:1:B>
But nothing like <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#19:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#20:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#21:1:B>
And <,> in Hubli my God so many <,> guys got into the <,> bus and
you should have seen that they were almost falling on you all over the place
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#22:1:B>
And then there was one fellow who was <,,> uh and there was this
one fellow who was sitting next to me <,> and then you know he was pushing
the bag so that he could get closer to me <O> laughter </O> and then I pushed
the bag again <,> and I sat like <,> then <,,> he got the message I think so
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-040#23:1:B>
And what are you doing <,> two two days when I had gone home <,>
