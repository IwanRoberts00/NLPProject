Respected Chairman <,,> distinguished guests <,,> and fellow  
<,,> delegates <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#2:1:A>
I would like to say at the outset <,> <w> I'm </w> very much  
illequipped paper reader <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#3:1:A>
Actually I didn't <,> I was not aware of the <,> change in the  
schedule <,,> which was not really supplied to me yesterday <,> I was one of  
the first paper Readers put down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#4:1:A>
But anyhow I am happy that I am able to <,> read it <,> read it out  
today <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#5:1:A>
And taking into consideration <,> the limitations of time usually in  
such <,> seminars I have jotted down <,,> some stray thoughts <,,> that too  
on a known author well discussed by you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#6:1:A>
Of course I am not a committed feminist or anything like that but  
<,> based on my own reading <,,> I would like to share a few thoughts on  
Sylvia <w> Plath's </w> poem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#7:1:A>
Of course with a slight difference <,,> from the normally vaulted  
<,,> past <,> adpoted by most of the <,> major voices <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#8:1:A>
Uh the actually <,> I <,,> struck upon this idea <,> when I was  
reading Yung in some another context <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#9:1:A>
And I had a feeling that uh <,> perhaps uh <,,> <w> Plath's </w>  
insistance <,> struggle or some sort of an obssession <,> with the definition  
or redefinition of self <,,> could be looked at from <,,> the complex concept  
of sex as <,,> sorry of the individual <,> in which <,,> two polarities the  
male and female are combined <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#10:1:A>
But anyhow I have not made a very deep analysis of that problem  
here <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#11:1:A>
But on the other hand I have taken up a few poems <,> and try to  
suggest why don't we look at this way <,> and try to see <,,> a perhaps <,,>  
another major concern of Plath <,> rather than labelling her as <,,> an out  
and out feminist <,,> or a committed confessional poet <,,> or anything of  
that sort 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#12:1:A>
Perhaps I think one of the major <,,> problems which could still be  
studied <,> in relation to her poetry <,,> is the integrity <,,> of the self  
<,,> without being <}> <-> <.> st </.> </-> <,> <=> strictly </=> </}> <,,>  
related to <,,> any gender <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#13:1:A>
Or the thrust of my paper <,> which I have intend to <,> elaborate  
later on is <,,> to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps  
studied <,> in relation to her poems <,,> could be quite free from the gender  
concerns <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#14:1:A>
She takes into consideration the problems created <,,> by the male  
<,,> as well as the female <,> in defining a self intact <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#15:1:A>
So with this <,,> introductory remarks <,> I am <,,> reading my  
paper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#16:1:A>
The self in Sylvia <w> Plath's </w> plays it is different <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#17:1:A>
In a very general sense Sylvia <w> Plath's </w> poetry <,> as a  
whole has been <,> an insistant search to find and define the self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#18:1:A>
Though she is often labelled as a confessional poet <,> in her  
perception <,> of the self and the poetic process <,> she is quite different  
from <,> say Dorothy <,> Robert <?> Loyal </?> <,> John <?> Berryman </?> and  
<,> Annie Saxon and the like <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#19:1:A>
She links private motives <,> and images <,> into sequences that  
form the part of a coherent drama <,> a symbolic enactment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#20:1:A>
The approach adopted by her <,> in the last poem <,,> about which I  
am making some observations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#21:1:A>
The last poem <,> contained <mention> An aerial </mention> <,>  
adventurous spirit <,,> throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and  
peculiar perception of the self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#22:1:A>
The victim sends <,> feminist stance <,,> concessional strain <,>  
and the suicidal mania <,> gain relevance <,> and meaning <,> when one should  
read to link these factors <,> with her self <,> or in other words herself  
<,,> with a difference <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#23:1:A>
<w> Plath's </w> feminism her confessionalism and suicide <,> are  
to be seen in relation to her relentless <,> poetic <,> transformation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#24:1:A>
An inevitable rebirth through death <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#25:1:A>
A hightened awareness of the individuals painful <O> one word </O>  
<,,> in contemporary society <,,> becomes <,,> the central <,,> focus <,,> of  
their I mean contemporary <w> poet's </w> <,> poems <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#26:1:A>
<w> Plath's </w> poetry <,> <}> <-> of <}> <-> <.> imit </.> </->  
<=> of initiation </=> </}> <,,> transformation <,,> thus appears within its  
general social framework <,> as a means of escape <,> from the identities and  
forces <,> that imprisoned the self in <,,> America <,> or perhaps elsewhere  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#27:1:A>
In the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty  
context <,,> there is some scope for looking at <w> Plath's </w> work <,,>  
from a feminist point of view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#28:1:A>
This view centres upon her supposed <,,> victimisation <,,> by a  
male dominated world <,> and her consequence <,> <w> feminist's </w> stance  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#29:1:A>
Lack of recognition <,,> in a male dominated world <,> shocking  
childhood experiences <,,> and the separation <,> from her husband <,,> of  
course these are all autobiographical factors <,> which may or may not be of  
relevance <,> paranthetically <,> might have contributed to shape her fury  
<,,> and even to unchange <,> her true self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#30:1:A>
Feminist <,> views her death <,,> as a form of martyrdom <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#31:1:A>
Her life <,,> a case history in the devilish cultural politics <,>  
that favours men over women <,> and destroys <w> women's </w> creativity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#32:1:A>
Actual biographical details of <w> Plath's </w> may not augment  
this stance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#33:1:A>
However <,> because I think she had <,> sufficient <,,> acclaim <,>  
her poetry was <,> fairly well ratified <,,> but in the particular time at  
which she was writing say <,,> I think poetry was <,> at a lower base <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#34:1:A>
I think even now it is applied <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#35:1:A>
When we list this <O> one word </O> <w> I'm </w> sure <,> the  
response will be much better <,> when we discuss poetry probably the response  
is limited because <,,> it shows <,> on the one hand the <w> readers' </w>  
response <,> response <,> and I think poetry is not in great demand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#36:1:A>
So that may not be something very peculiar to Plath <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#37:1:A>
However <,> the distinguishing feature of <w> Plath's </w> self in  
her poems particularly her later ones <,,> is that she looks at the world  
from the point of view of an oppressed one <,> not strictly gender bound <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#38:1:A>
In the last poems there is a rare fury <,> a total release from  
fear <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#39:1:A>
The recourse to <-> a </-> aggression in the last poem is neither  
abreast <,> nor <,> aesthetically uncalled for <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#40:1:A>
I think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her  
earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems <,> this trend could  
be seen <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#41:1:A>
This was some sort of a progressive release <,,> from the clutches  
<,> of fear <,> and which culminates in a sort of fury <,> which I think  
render possible <,> the liberation <,> of the self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#42:1:A>
Of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#43:1:A>
<}> <-> I <.> ci </.> </-> <=> I quote </=> </}> a few lines from  
<,,> a poem which is usually quoted <,> to cite her <,,> feminist strength in  
<indig> <mention> Pardah </mention> </indig> for example <,,> she makes a  
declaration of independence <,,> <quote> I shall unloose <,,> from the small  
jewelled form <,,> from the small <,> jewelled doll she got like a heart <,>  
the lioness <,,> the shriek in the barks <,> the cloak of whole </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#44:1:A>
In another poem which is a longer poem <,> <mention> Three Women  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#45:1:A>
Through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl <,> she brings  
to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being <,> an approved  
mother <,,> with a son <,,> a woman <,> with a miscarriage <,> and a girl <,>  
with an accidental <?> daughter </?> <,,> whom she gives <,> away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#46:1:A>
Here one would perceive <,,> the subtle variation that Plath effect  
<,> to bring to the fore <,> herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#47:1:A>
Perhaps even in this period of emotional fury <,> and psychological  
collapse <,,> she plucks at courage and pronounces rather forcefully <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#48:1:A>
I quote <,,> from <mention> Winter Tree </mention> <,> <quote> I am  
no shadow <,,> though there is a shadow <,> starting from my feet <,> I am a  
wife <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#49:1:A>
The city waits and aches <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#50:1:A>
The little grasses <,> cracked through stone <,> and they are green  
<,> with light </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#51:1:A>
This robust <,,> assertion on the elemental beauty of life <,,>  
green with life <,,> brings in the difference in <w> Plath's </w> self <,,>  
even while being one <,,> with a <O> one word </O> <,> a feminist <,> or <,>  
a confessionist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#52:1:A>
While looking at <w> Plath's </w> poem from a feminist point of  
view one has to bear in mind two vital points <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#53:1:A>
One <,,> Sylvia Plath <,,> may not be a feminist as one is likely  
to believe <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#54:1:A>
For she does not commit herself to <,> ideological problems in her  
writings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#55:1:A>
If that is a major concern <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#56:1:A>
There is limited gender based <,> class hatred in her poems <,> to  
my mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#57:1:A>
Time and again she directs her anger <,> against select individuals  
<,> her father <,> her husband <,> or their symbolic representatives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#58:1:A>
Even the passages of a hot nature when I quote <,> that we find in  
a poem like <mention> Lady Lazarus </mention> <,,> further <,> <mention> The  
Applicant </mention> and <mention> Three Women </mention> <,> may not be  
sufficient evidence <,,> to argue that Plath had a <,,> committed <,,> well  
defined <,> feminist <,> politics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#59:1:A>
At best one could say <,> that in such lines <,> I quote from  
<mention> Daddy </mention> <,> <quote> Her boss her Lucifer <,> <?> devour  
devour </?> out of the ash I write with my red hair <,> and I eat men like  
air </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#60:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sorry <w> I've </w> quoted these lines from <,>  
<mention> Lady Lazarus </mention> <,> <O> one word </O> <,,> <quote> They are  
<,,> dancing and <}> <-> scanting </-> <+> jumping </+> </}> on you <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#61:1:A>
They always knew it was you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#62:1:A>
Daddy <,> daddy <,> you <?> bastard </?> I am through </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#63:1:A>
Plath <,> directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her  
dead father <,> and against her husband <,,> into an attack on marriage and  
men <,> or in a more inclusive way <,,> which I think maybe more <,,>  
beneficial <,> against violence <,> against total violence perhaps <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#64:1:A>
<mention> With your permission </mention> <&> to the audiance </&>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#65:1:A>
The strength of her mature poetry <,,> suddenly lies in her ability  
to coilate polarities <,> particularly the male female polarities <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#66:1:A>
Yielding a delicate <,,> or even diabolic of course it is  
questionable <,> balance in the human strain <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#67:1:A>
This aspect is borne out by her poems <,,> <mention> <?> Lasposs  
<,> Medusa </?> </mention> <,,> and the other <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#68:1:A>
Really she <,,> lashes out with equal violence <,,> on women <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#69:1:A>
I quote <,> <quote> Violent attacks on women in this well sort of  
<,> not far and few </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#70:1:A>
This only points to herself with a difference <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#71:1:A>
In <mention> <?> Lassposs </?> </mention> she mocks <,,> any bounds  
that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender  
<,> or shared oppression <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#72:1:A>
I have quoted <,,> the poet herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#73:1:A>
I quote from one of her poem <,,> <quote> Your voice <,,> my earing  
<,> flapping and sucking blood loving bath <,,> <w> that's </w> that <w>  
that's </w> that <,> you peer from the doors sad had every woman <,> is a  
whore <,> I can't communicate </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#74:1:A>
So I think her problem of defining the self or her problem of  
establishing a camaraderie <,> is not strictly regimented to <,> or confined  
to the men <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#75:1:A>
But on the other hand she has been <,> more or less undergoing this  
dramatic experience in relation to women also <,> which I think critics have  
not very often taken into <,> serious consideration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#76:1:A>
<w> That's </w> my feeling <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#77:1:A>
It may be noted that one of her recurrent images of <-> for </->  
women <,> is the <?> Medusa </?> image <,,> which I think <,> is not a very  
enduring one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#78:1:A>
Plath unlike the later feminist <,> never struck to any particular  
ideology <,> in relation to male <,> female conflicts <,> or what we have now  
begun to term as <,> even the male female crisis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#79:1:A>
Depending on the poetic situations <,> she shifted her views on the  
male female issues <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#80:1:A>
For her the prime concern <,> is the integrity of herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#81:1:A>
Perhaps <,,> the difference in her perception and hence her self  
lies in her existencial streak <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#82:1:A>
I think <w> I'll </w> be in agreement with previous paper reader  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#83:1:A>
She strikes again the male and female <,> with equal venom and  
vehemence <,> whenever they <,> irrespective of the gender <,> become a  
threat to her self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#84:1:A>
Plath discusses <,> a consciousness of political issues <,> but the  
focus of her politics was neither women nor <w> men's </w> role in <w>  
women's </w> oppression <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#85:1:A>
As she explained in a B B C interview <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#86:1:A>
I quote <,> <quote> She was imaginatively involved in those  
historical political events <,> that are closest to the concerned voice in  
her poems </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#87:1:A>
She herself has listed a number of concerns <,> Hiroshima <,> atom  
bomb <,> <O> one word </O> and Nazism <,> which again points to <,> her  
protest against the general violence total violence <,> rather than the  
violence <,,> impeached on women <,> by men <,> strictly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#88:1:A>
The sequence of her late poems <,> <mention> The bee <w> keeper's  
</w> daughter </mention> <,> is quite revealing in this <,> sense <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#89:1:A>
In a way it anticipates the Lady Lazarus mood <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#90:1:A>
The crux of the sequence in a quest <,> is <,,> a quest for an  
independent queenly self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#91:1:A>
The first poem the <mention> The Bee Meeting </mention> <,> just  
describes the usual practice of replacing old hives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#92:1:A>
But it soon becomes an awful ritual <,> for the protagonist <,,>  
for <,,> it is directed by <,,> I quote <quote> dreary <,> depersonlised <,>  
a <O> one word </O> like figures <,> of a midwife <,> a rector and a sexton  
<,> as they are also agents <,> respectively of birth marriage and death  
</quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#93:1:A>
The poem turns out to be <,> the first step in a cyclic exploration  
of the self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#94:1:A>
Curiously <,> these agents are protected <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#95:1:A>
But the protagonist is utterly exposed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#96:1:A>
I quote <,> <quote> nude as a chicken <?> neck </?> </quote>  
unquote <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#97:1:A>
However the mood of aggression <,,> asserting the peculiar strength  
of her self <,> is sustained in the arrival of the Bee-box <,> and <,> stings  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#98:1:A>
The end of the Rabbit catcher <,> another good poem to be looked at  
from this point of view <,> clearly suggest <,> the constraints set by <,,>  
the man in personal relationships <,> maybe <,> a male female relationship  
<,,> maybe a male <,,> say a female female relationship <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#99:1:A>
Obviously here too she is concerned <,> with the integrity of the  
self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#100:1:A>
She abhors <,> I quote <,,> <quote> And we two had a relationship  
<,,> tight wire between us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#101:1:A>
Takes too deep to approve <,> and a mind like earring <,> sliding  
shut on some quick <,> sand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#102:1:A>
The constrict <,,> the constriction <,> killing me also <,,> <O>  
two words </O> </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#103:1:A>
Even in this way <,,> the difference in her self is reflected in  
her persistance on <,,> themes relating to children and rebirths <,> in the  
poems of her last phase <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#104:1:A>
Sylvia <w> Plath's </w> confessional mood <,,> and mood <,> is a  
designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#105:1:A>
<mention> Morning Song <,> Nick and the Candletick <,> Death and  
Company <,> Cuts the Bee-Meeting <,> Tulips </mention> etcetera are some  
poems <,,> which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical  
revealations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#106:1:A>
These poems record <,> I quote <quote> Personal experience <,> in  
the patterns <,> that obtain an objective character of <,> though repetition  
<,> illusion <,> and symbolic inactment </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#107:1:A>
Unquote <,> Plath right from the beginning to the end <,> in her  
creative essay <,> has been experimenting with the integrity of the self <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#108:1:A>
I underline the integrity of the self <,> through a series of  
emotionally charged <,> even hyper charged explorations <,,> by her feminist  
concerns <,> confessional overtures <,,> suicidal leaps <,,> and through her  
bold linguistic innovations <,,> she could present a self <,> with a  
difference <,> to the reading <,,> public <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-044#109:1:A>
Thank you <,,> </I>
