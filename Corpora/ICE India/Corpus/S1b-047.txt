<&> Recording broken </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#2:1:A>
A legend in his lifetime <,> known as the greatest gentleman tennis
player of the world

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#3:1:A>
Certainly <w> India's </w> greatest tennis player ever

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#4:1:A>
And right now he is with us in our studios Mr Ramanathan Krishnan
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#5:1:A>
Mr Krishnan <,> welcome to our studios and thank you very much for
<,> being with us

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#6:1:B>
Thank you Deepak <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#7:1:A>
Uh we would like to take you down memory lanes <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> we would like to travel into the past

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#8:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#9:1:A>
Tell us about how you <,> got involved in tennis ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#10:1:B>
Yes <,,> uhm see I come from a tennis playing family <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#11:1:B>
It all <,> my father started the whole thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#12:1:B>
And he used to be a good player <,> in his playing days that was
before the war time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#13:1:B>
And he used them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#14:1:B>
He was the best player in the south and <,> he was one of the top
ranking Indian player <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#15:1:B>
So he <,> he put me into tennis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#16:1:B>
And then <,> infact he put Ramesh also <}> <-> to </-> <+> into
</+> </}> tennis <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#17:1:A>
Who coached you in your earliest days <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#18:1:B>
My father has been my main <,> my main coach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#19:1:B>
Uh he started coaching me when I was about <,> ten years old <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#20:1:B>
That <-> was </-> used to be <,> you know that you <,> people used
to consider quite younger that time

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#21:1:B>
But today <,> they start as early as <,> five or six <,> know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#22:1:B>
I started when I was about ten years old <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#23:1:B>
And uh <,> my father went <}> <-> to </-> <+> for </+> </}> some
rigorous programmes for me

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#24:1:B>
Lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh <,> it was hard
work <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#25:1:A>
Uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much
as on <,> proficiency in the game <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#26:1:A>
And at the time when you were being coached <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#27:1:B>
Well Deepak it has been the same <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#28:1:B>
I mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#29:1:B>
And in fact people ask me <,> <quote> How do you compare a champion
of a <,> nineteen twenties or thirties </quote> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#30:1:B>
You know <,> <w> I've </w> not seen them but <,> you know I talked
to people and uh <,,> champions <,> of todays

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#31:1:B>
I think that one common factor <,> that is physical fitness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#32:1:B>
They all had to be <}> <-> <.> phy </.> </-> <=> physically </=>
</}> very fit <,> and uh <,> it is only athletes <,> who can play this game
well <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#33:1:A>
What kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you
started playing tennis <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#34:1:B>
Well uh <,> you can't compare it with todays <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#35:1:B>
Facilities are much more today <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#36:1:B>
But in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden
rackets <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#37:1:B>
Now you see <,> no rackets of graphite and aluminium and uh <,> <w>
there're </w> so many varieties of rackets now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#38:1:B>
<w> It's </w> an improvement because with uh <,> less effort <w>
you're </w> able to get more pace <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#39:1:B>
The pace is an advantage for the modern players

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#40:1:B>
We didn't had that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#41:1:B>
But then <,> <w> we're </w> good players of the time like <,> take
Rod Laver

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#42:1:B>
Uh I mean he played with the wooden rackets

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#43:1:B>
And <,> Lu Hoad or Jack Kramer they hit the ball as hard because
<,> they had a very good timing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#44:1:B>
So <,,> <w> it's </w> a question of I mean I do agree that the
equipment is better <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#45:1:B>
But you know once you <,> you know as an athlete who is very
talented <,> I mean you <,> you give <}> <-> my </-> <+> him </+> </}>
broomstick he can play tennis well <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#46:1:A>
Was it possible to <,> make a living out of tennis <w> I'm
</w> sorry to put such a material <,> <{> <[> no no <,> question to you

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#47:1:A>
Was it possible to do that ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#48:1:B>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#49:1:B>
Very interesting question

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#50:1:B>
Very good question <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#51:1:B>
And it used to be amateur sports those days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#52:1:B>
Like I was an amateur player

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#53:1:B>
And <,> Rod Laver in his earlier days and Lu Hoad <w> they're </w>
all amateurs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#54:1:B>
Then they turn professional later on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#55:1:B>
And uh <,> it was <-> a </-> mainly an amateur sports <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#56:1:B>
In fact those days unfortunately they used to look down <,> on the
professionals you know

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#57:1:B>
So they were very few in number <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#58:1:B>
They used to be under group under Jack Kramer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#59:1:B>
And uh <,> in nineteen sixty things have changed

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#60:1:B>
And the status of the game has changed now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#61:1:B>
Now <w> it's </w> a professional sport <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#62:1:B>
A full time job and uh <,,> <}> <-> <.> luc </.> </-> <=> lucrative
</=> </}> career for the top players <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#63:1:A>
Mr Krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have
always wanted to ask you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#64:1:A>
Forgive me for this question but <,> having reached the peak <,>
<{> <[> yeah <,> all of a sudden Ramanathan Krishnan just sort of went away

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#65:1:A>
Hang out his racket and he went away <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#66:1:A>
Uh <,> you you didn't <,> get interested in coaching you didn't
want to take an active part in <,> the management of tennis in this country

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#67:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#68:1:B>
Well uh <,,> I didn't hang up my racket quickly

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#69:1:B>
I mean I had a pretty long innings <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#70:1:B>
I mean I played for quiet a long time you know I had a long innings
you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#71:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#72:1:B>
I played nearly <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> twenty-five to thirty
years <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#73:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#74:1:B>
In fact I had three <w> life's </w> in tennis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#75:1:B>
First I was playing you know <,> my best playing days is in the
fifties and the sixties <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#76:1:B>
Then I quit for sometime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#77:1:B>
And uh when Ramesh started improving his tennis <,> I thought <w>
it's </w> a good idea to <,> you know compete with him and uh <,> you know
practice with him which would help him which it did <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#78:1:B>
So I came back in the <,> seventies <,> seventy-four or
seventy-five around that time

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#79:1:B>
And Ramesh was coming up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#80:1:B>
Then Ramesh was on his own feet <,> improved and went you know went
the circuit

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#81:1:B>
I quit again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#82:1:B>
And finally in the early eighties <,> around eighty-two <,> they
introduced a new event called the grand masters <,> meant for <,,> ex-tennis
players <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#83:1:B>
You know <w> who've </w> <,> done well in the earlier years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#84:1:B>
But <w> they're </w> too old to <,> compete in regular competition

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#85:1:B>
They call it a grand masters events <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#86:1:B>
It was the assembly of <,> ex-champions ex-tennis players <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#87:1:B>
So I was invited to take part in that <,> in the main in United
States and a few tournaments in Europe <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#88:1:B>
So I competed again <,> again against people like <,> Rod Laver
Kanross Wall all big legendary names you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#89:1:B>
I enjoyed it <,> and uh it was lot of fun and <w> that's </w> also
finished now because <,,> you know the reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#90:1:B>
New forty-fives are now coming in <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#91:1:B>
You know when I was forty-five

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#92:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> fifty-four now <,> played for nearly nine ten years
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#93:1:B>
And I <,> we had lot of fun and we had good competition <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#94:1:B>
And now the new forty-fives you know <,> for event like that you
always need some new blood <,> <{> <[> ah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#95:1:B>
So the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#96:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#97:1:B>
They are already professionals in the rally

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#98:1:B>
<w> We're </w> not professional <,> <{> <[> yes <,> but the new
persons are coming in

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#99:1:B>
So that event is going on now

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#100:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#101:1:A>
Well this this <,> senior collegue of mine here is nine
hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to <{> <[> learn tennis
</[> in a little while

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#102:1:B>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#103:1:B>
Ah ha

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#104:1:A>
But there is the question that <,> that I I want to repeat it
again Mr Krishnan <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#105:1:A>
Why has uh <,> Mr Krishnan never been available for coaching ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#106:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#107:1:B>
Yeah you asked me that question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#108:1:B>
You see <,> as I said that I kept playing uh <,,> the lesson
important like I played the grand masters for eight nine years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#109:1:B>
Then in between I was <,> travelling with Ramesh trying to help
him for a few years

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#110:1:B>
When he need <,> when he needed it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#111:1:B>
And I firmly believe <,> that <,> in this game <,> you know <w>
it's </w> uh <,> <w> it's </w> a long process <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#112:1:B>
This coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes
years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#113:1:B>
If I take up <,> two or three boys or four boys and <,> <w> I've
</w> to live with them be with them right through

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#114:1:B>
And I couldn't do anything else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#115:1:B>
And <w> it's </w> a long process <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#116:1:B>
I couldn't afford the time

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#117:1:B>
And I didn't want to you know <-> takes stuck </-> take up
something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#118:1:B>
So this is one of the main reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#119:1:B>
And uh <,,> in this country <w> we've </w> good coaches who teach
the fundamentals of the game alright <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#120:1:B>
Where <w> we're </w> lagging behind is <,,> when they improve the
tennis <w> they're </w> a bit directionless <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#121:1:A>
We here <,> a little dicky bird a little rumour <w> that's
</w> <,> Ramanathan Krishnan is now going to go in for coaching <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#122:1:A>
Is there any truth in this ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#123:1:B>
Well uh <,> yes <w> I'm </w> in the capital for two reasons
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#124:1:B>
One is to watch the Davis Cup match <w> that's </w> going on
between <,> India and Korea

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#125:1:B>
Which is at a very interesting stage

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#126:1:A>
In which <,> in which your son played <{> <[> brilliantly
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#127:1:B>
<[> My son played </[> </{> very well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#128:1:B>
<w> He's </w> been good yesterday <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#129:1:B>
And uh <,> <w> I'm </w> here also for another important reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#130:1:B>
I met again dynamic man called Bobby Singh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#131:1:B>
Who is uh in organising a tennis academy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#132:1:B>
Uh tennis for tennis academy

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#133:1:B>
I believe <w> he's </w> going to have it <,> in the capital <,> in
this area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#134:1:B>
And uh object is to <,> unearth talents <,> tennis talents <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#135:1:B>
And then give them all the opportunities and uh <,> you know give
them the coaching and training facilities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#136:1:B>
So that <,> you know <,> take a group of some thirty forty boys
and girls <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#137:1:B>
So that out of the <,> quantity <,> a few good quality player may
be three or four will come out in three years time

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#138:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a very good idea <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#139:1:B>
So he asked me when I was here last month passing through Delhi
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#140:1:B>
He Asked me whether I could help them or give them a little <,>
few few tips and all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#141:1:B>
So I thought <w> it's </w> a good idea and uh <,> you know <->
I've </-> did <?> away </?> lot pressure out of game <,> lot of things out of
this game <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#142:1:B>
So I said why not give that to game <,> in some small way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#143:1:B>
So <-> I said </-> I agreed and uh <,> right after the Davis Cup
match <,> I think around the nineth or tenth <,> or a week <,> <w> I'm </w>
going to be working with this uh <,> young children

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#144:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#152:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sorry I said he was nine hundred and something
he says <w> he's </w> five thousand years old

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#153:1:B>
<w> You'll </w> have to be very young to <,> <O> one word
</O> this game and play this game <,> you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#154:1:A>
Which is very young <,> <O> laughs </O> <w> he's </w> five

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#155:1:B>
<O> Laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#156:1:A>
Mr Krishnan what do you consider <,> which match do you
consider your greatest match ever <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#157:1:B>
Well as stated earlier I had a long inning

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#158:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#159:1:B>
So <,> I had to mention two or three of them <{> <[> you know
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#160:1:A>
<[> Alright </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#161:1:B>
I think uh <,,> I would always I mean <,> all the listeners
would expect me to say this <,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#162:1:B>
The match against Thomas Coss which I played <,,> inter-zonal
final against <,> Brazilian Davis Cup competition nineteen sixty-six <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#163:1:B>
That is very important <,> because I was playing the fifth match

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#164:1:B>
It was two match for I was playing the fifth match <,> and of
course <,> out on grass court <,> which tend out to be a <,> a marathon match
a deciding match which I happen to win <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#165:1:B>
<w> That's </w> very important because that took the country to
the <,> final position they used to call it a challenge you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#166:1:B>
The challenge for the Davis Cup was there for the first time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#167:1:B>
You know first time is always very important <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#168:1:B>
And I always take pride in that that I broke that ice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#169:1:B>
And you know <w> we've </w> got to the finals

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#170:1:B>
It was a thrilling moments for other players Thomas Coss <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#171:1:B>
And uh <,> well <,,> uh <w> that's </w> about thirty years ago <,>
nearly <O> laughter </O> twenty-five years ago

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#172:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#173:1:A>
Yeah <,> then <w> you're </w> going to mention one or two other
matches that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#174:1:B>
This is the main one because you know <w> it's </w> a Davis
Cup match <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#175:1:B>
Another one is uh <,> I always remembered <,> my matches against
Roy Emerson the quarter final at Wimbledon

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#176:1:B>
We played on the central court <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#177:1:B>
I was seeded number seven

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#178:1:B>
He was number four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#179:1:B>
He was a favourite <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#180:1:B>
I played exceptionally well on that day and <,,> I managed to be
in great state <,,> uh which took me to the semi-final of Wimbledon for the
second time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#181:1:B>
That was a very important match uh <,> quality wise

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#182:1:B>
I played good tennis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#183:1:B>
And another one which I always remember is <,> as against Rod
Laver in the opening round the opening match of the <,> Davis Cup competition
inter-zone finals between India and Australia <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#184:1:B>
We played the match in the United States <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#185:1:B>
You know those days the rules of the games

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#186:1:B>
The rules of the Davis Cup competition were such that <,> you know
the nation that was holding the Cup

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#187:1:B>
You know today <w> it's </w> not like that

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#188:1:B>
Today everybody plays no ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#189:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#190:1:B>
But those days <,> the nation which was holding the cup the
holders <,> they played only one match

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#191:1:B>
They played winners of the <,> rest of the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#192:1:B>
So on that that year <,> I mean United States was holding the Cup
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#193:1:B>
Which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone
finals <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> in the United States <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#194:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#195:1:B>
I played that match in Boston and beat Laver

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#196:1:B>
I mean I must confess that Rod Laver was that great

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#197:1:B>
He played afterwards with everybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#198:1:B>
But even then <,> he was the Wimbledon <,> finalist and uh <,>
that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because I realise how talented he
was and uh <,> I won in four serve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#199:1:B>
I always remember that match <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#200:1:A>
When you reached <,> the semi-finals of the Wimbledon for the
first time <,> <{1> <[1> yeah <,> before went to play that match <,> <{2>
<[2> yeah <,> what did you do <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#201:1:A>
And after you played it what did you do ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#202:1:A>
<{> <[> You knew that <w> you've </w> beaten </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#203:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#204:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#205:1:B>
<[> Ah yeah <w> I'll </w> </[> </{> tell you something

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#206:1:B>
Looking back <,> well I know certain things which I shouldn't have
done

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#207:1:B>
<w> It's </w> too late <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#208:1:B>
Thats what <}> <-> happened in </-> <+> happens </+> </}> you know
<+> in </+> all walks of life <,> you make some mistakes

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#209:1:B>
I did make a mistake <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#210:1:B>
Somewhere on I was over awed at that occasion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#211:1:B>
But I got in the semi-finals at Wimbledon

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#212:1:B>
I was over awed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#213:1:B>
You know <w> it's </w> only two matches to win to win the title I
was very close to it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#214:1:B>
And the people who <w> I'm </w> playing <,> I had beaten them here
and there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#215:1:B>
You know <w> it's </w> not that they had always beaten me <,> but
uh <,> <w> I've </w> one occasion I lost to Neil Fraser neat serve uh another
occasion <,> Rod Laver

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#216:1:B>
Second level Rod Laver in sixty-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#217:1:B>
And you know <,> <w> it's </w> interesting to know that <w> I've
</w> not lost to Lord Laver until then <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#218:1:B>
But on that occasion I was over awed <,> and they were two <,> two
of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#219:1:B>
It so happened I had to play them on fast grass court

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#220:1:B>
This I wouldn't play well and uh <,> they were the better players

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#221:1:B>
But I think if uh <,,> I should have been little more you know it
is <O> one word </O> <,> a little more ambitious <,> and you know <,> I
played normally

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#222:1:B>
I should have done something extra bit you know

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#223:1:B>
On an occasion like that <,> you can't afford to play just normal
tennis and get away

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#224:1:B>
<w> You've </w> to do something extra

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#225:1:B>
Which I didn't do <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#226:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#235:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#241:1:A>
Uh Mr Krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman
tennis player

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#242:1:A>
Now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to
but <w> I've </w> heard again from your comtemporaries <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>
that if there was ever a line called <,> which the empire awarded in your
favour <,> but you thought that it belong to the <,> to your opponent <,>
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#243:1:A>
Is that true ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#244:1:A>
That you would <,> you would you know equalise

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-047#245:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-047#246:1:B>
