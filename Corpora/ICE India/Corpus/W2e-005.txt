<ICE-IND:W2E-005#2:1>
A GROWING AWARENESS of the inadequacy of the development effort
and, in particular, of the raw deal meted out to the rural poor underlies
the National Front <w> Government's </w> search for a strategy in the
economic sphere.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#3:1>
Time is not obviously on the side of a minority government in the
matter of sculpting a model that will not fail to close the gap between the
urban upper and middle income groups and the predominant rural population
caught in economic deprivation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#4:1>
Nor is it inherently logical to expect a quick breakaway from a path
pursued over the last four decades, one which was characterised largely by
the funneling of the investible resources into modernisation, whether in
agriculture, industry or the associated service sector.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#5:1>
The action plan of the V. P. Singh Government, released at the dawn
of the New year, stresses the commitment to the objective of shifting the
centre of gravity of the process of development to rural India.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#6:1>
The central element of the new strategy is that, from the annual plan
for 1990-91, <quote> " at least 50 per cent of investible resources" </quote>
will be canalised into the agricultural and rural sector.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#7:1>
How exactly can this be brought about and what kinds of policy
package would be needed?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#8:1>
If budgetary experience has any lessons to offer, the point needs to
be made that, during the first four years of the Seventh Plan period, the
total outlay on agriculture, rural development, irrigation and flood
control, has not been more than 25 per cent of the aggregate expenditure.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#9:1>
It may not be difficult to redesign plan accounting to provide
segregated data relating to the rural compolnent in such categories as
social services, transport and energy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#10:1>
But the quantum of resources pumped into the rural areas in the
past has been such that the proposed enlargement of outlay will mean a
colossal addition to it.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#11:1>
The annual plan outlay of the Centre for 1989-90, for instance, was
budgeted at <indig> Rs. </indig> 34,446 <indig> crores, </indig> of which the
explicit rural share was hardly <indig> Rs. </indig> 3,500 <indig> crores.
</indig>

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#12:1>
Assuming that the outlay for the first year of the Eighth Plan
will be stepped up by 20 per cent, what the resolve of the Government will
imply is that additional resources of at least <indig> Rs. </indig> 15,000
<indig> crores </indig> will have to be made to flow into the rural sector.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#13:1>
It is all very well to pledge bigger support for the needed
revitalisation of agriculture and the rural living conditions in general.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#14:1>
The critical lacuna in the policy, as has often been the case in
the past, is an integrated multi-sector startegy whereby employment,
income and consumption expenditure can be raised along with - - or even as
a precursor of - - a larger availability of wage goods.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#15:1>
An action plan without specific details about how the requisite
strategy will be set in motion might end up the way <foreign> ad hoc
</foreign> employment generation schemes such as NREP, IRDP and RLEGP have
done, that is to say, scatter financial resources over a wide area ( with the
concomitant diversions of funds into unauthorised and illlicit channels)
without endowing the poor with land or other assets or strenghtening the
employment-wages structure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-005#16:1>
The action plan does encompass land reforms, the expansion of
the network of rural warehouses and a comprehensive national housing policy
which can itself set the pace for a host of developmental stimuli in the
rural areas.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#17:1>
But given the fact that land reforms have been thwarted over the
years through the dilution of ceiling laws, the notorious absence of
authentic land records and the extensive resort to <indig> benami </indig>
transactions, it would be a mistake to hope for any dramatic redistribution
of land among the landless peasants.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#18:1>
In any case, one has to contend with the basic shortage of
cultivable land in relation to the population.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#19:1>
A decision to strengthen the system of farm price support
should be taken with a view not only to compensating the agricultural
producers for inflation and the higher wage cost entailed in the new
policy line but also to making the remunerative price an abiding reality.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#20:1>
It will then help serve as a key corrective to the accumulated
distortions in the terms of trade which have dampened investments in
agriculture.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#21:1>
What will the increased official flow of funds into the rural economy
combined with remunerative prices presage for the urban industrial and
service sectors?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#22:1>
A new regime of cost push inflation?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#23:1>
A chronic shortage of capital with the conse quent slowdown of
industrial activity?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#24:1>
If budgetary deficits are contained firmly and the exportimport
policy framework is effectively geared to serving the twin needs of import
substitution and export diversification, there is no inevitability about a
rural thrust operating to the detriment of an expanding industrial system.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#25:1>
Nor need there be any apprehensions about investible savings not
being generated at an adequate rate.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#26:1>
The promise of a new long term fiscal policy apart, what ought to
guide the Planning Commission and the Government from now onwards is a vision
of national economic well being built around the regeneration of the hope
of concrete benefits rather than the mere raising of expectations among all
sections of the people. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#28:1>
FEW AMONG THE Opposition in Myanmar ( Burma) will be inclined
to see the <w> Government's </w> decision to relax martial law in the
troubled regions of Mandalay and Sagaing and the removal of restrictions on
five politicians as a step towards democracy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#29:1>
Given the tactics adopted by the State Law and Order Restoration
Council ( SLORC) in the last few months, the latest development will be
viewed as nothing more than a public relations exercise, partly intended
to convince the people and the international community at large that
elections slated for May 27 are proceeding according to schedule.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#30:1>
The real question is the extent to which the polls are going to be
free and fair with the government guaranteeing the participation of all
the political parties irrespective of their relationship to the military
authorities.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#31:1>
Even in the context of the latest partial relaxation of martial
law, it is said that the regime was forced to move in that direction in the
face of small but determined protests in parts of Mandalay.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#32:1>
That things are far from normal is seen from the fact that the
military has the <quote> ` legal' </quote> sanction to enforce curfew, ban
groups of more than five people gathering, besides restricting freedom of
speech and political discussion.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#33:1>
Silencing dissent by placing Opposition politicians under house
arrest has become quite common - - witness, for instance, the curbs placed on
the former Prime Minister, Mr. U Nu, late last month.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#34:1>
And the treatment meted out to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi of the National
League for Democracy has been no different - - apart from keeping her under
house arrest since July last year, the military brass has, from time to time,
indicated that she may be put on trial. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-005#35:1>
If the regime in Myanmar is really serious about doing away with
the harsh laws and setting in motion a genuine democratic course, it has to
do away totally with the martial law, and that too before the May elections.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#36:1>
Elections under controlled conditions will certainly not be
acceptable to the people, much less the comity of nations.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#37:1>
Detaining Opposition politicians under one pretext or another or
sentencing them to prison terms is hardly the way to go about ushering in
qualitative changes in the political system.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#38:1>
Of what use are the polls if people like Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi are not
allowed to take part?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#39:1>
And putting her to trial before the polls on filmsy and trumped up
charges will only make matters worse.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#40:1>
Arguing that foreign powers are trying to disintegrate the state
under <quote> " a new form of colonialism" </quote> is not going to work, for
the SLORC is yet to refute international allegations on human rights abuses
in any meaningful fashion.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#41:1>
The leadership may want to believe that they have got over the
international economic pressure by signing contracts with foreign firms for
the exploration of oil and for the exploitation of natural resources.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#42:1>
This may have augmented or even improved the <w> country's </w>
foreign exchange reserves but the strategy is bound to go nowhere from a
longer term perspective.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#43:1>
Foreign debt is estimated at around

$5 billions with about two-thirds of this owed to Japan and West Germany; and
there is hardly any indication of these two nations writing off the loans
unless repression ends and political reforms are instituted.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#44:1>
More than the international economic or political pressure, the
military rulers in Myanmar would do well to keep in mind what went on the
Eastern Europe and other parts of the world in the last three years where
then inability of leaderships to gauge the popular mood led to to their
downfall.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#45:1>
Even the powerful armed forces in a few societies joined the
movements for democracy, hastening the exit of authoritarian regimes. </p>

<h> <bold> Eighth Plan uncertainities </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-005#47:2>
THE EIGHTH PLAN has had a chequered course right from the
beginning.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#48:2>
The finalisation of the document has been unduly delayed because
of the changes in government and differing approaches to the issues
involved.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#49:2>
It had been hoped that the Chandra Shekhar Government at least
would enable the Planning Commission to complete its work and the document
would be approved by the National Development Council before the end of
the month.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#50:2>
But new uncertainties have crept in with the exit of the Chandra
Shekhar Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#51:2>
It is <w> anybody's </w> guess what will be the eventual size and
content of the Plan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#52:2>
There has however been no Plan holiday, though the progress made in
1990-92 may not be at the desired rate and a big effort would have to be made
in subsequent years to reach the high targets visualised by various
working groups. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-005#53:2>
The progress in financial terms in 1990-91 has of course been
satisfactory having regard to the resources crunch and changes of horses mid
stream.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#54:2>
The total outlay of the Central and State Governments and Union
Territories is actually higher at <indig> Rs. </indig> 65,002 <indig>
crores </indig> in the revised estimate for 1990-91 against <indig> Rs.
</indig> 64,716.80 <indig> crores </indig> ( budget).

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#55:2>
But there has been a shortfall in Plan expenditure in the Central
sector and only a marginal increase in the share of the States.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#56:2>
The Union Territories have accounted for the bulk of the rise, their
expenditure being <indig> Rs. </indig> 2,348 <indig> crores </indig> against
<indig> Rs </indig> 1,071 <indig> crores. </indig>

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#57:2>
The shortfall in outlay in the Central sector has made it difficult
for even the modest physical targets to be realised.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#58:2>
With the paucity of resources and mounting non-Plan expenditure,
the prospects for 1991-92 too were not encouraging.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#59:2>
But the need for executing ongoing schemes and sustaining the tempo,
albeit on a lower key, has been responsible for the decision to increase
the public sector Plan allocation by 10.9 per cent over the revised outlay
for 1990-91.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#60:2>
While the Centre will be stepping up its spending by 10.8 per cent to
<indig> Rs. </indig> 42,148 <indig> crores, </indig> the States and the Union
Territories will be incurring higher expenditure of <indig> Rs. </indig>
29,300 <indig> crores </indig> against <indig> Rs. </indig> 26,950 <indig>
crores. </indig> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-005#61:2>
Having regard to the double digit inflation and slow start for
the Plan, a higher financial target should have been fixed.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#62:2>
But the inadequacy of funds is posing serious limits and other
agencies will have to be in the picture for achieving the higher growth rate
of six per cent now being contemplated.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#63:2>
However, the projects relating to the power, coal, oil, railways
and steel sectors will be accounting for over 50 per cent of the available
funds, though there is greater reliance on internally generated resources
of public sector enterprises and borrowing.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#64:2>
The budgetary support for Plan schemes has thus increased only
slightly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#65:2>
The schemes of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Oil India and
others will, as before, be financed largely by owned and borrowed funds.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#66:2>
This will be feasible as profits are at high levels.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#67:2>
The projects of the Steel Authority of India and others too will get
modest assistance from the Government and the balance will have to be found
from within and outside.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#68:2>
Does it mean that there will be an increase in prices for steel
products?

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#69:2>
The Railways have been given a raw deal as only in their case the
allocation will be lower than in the current financial year.

<ICE-IND:W2E-005#70:2>
In view of the latest developments, it is unlikely that there will be
any increase in the size of the Annual Plan and much will depend on how
the private and joint sectors are helped to play an important role in
taking up projects in the core sector. </p> </I>
