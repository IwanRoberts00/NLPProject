<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#1:1:A>
The <?> accord </?> took place under some very very special
circumstances <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#2:1:A>
To what extent was this this <?> accession </?> has the consent of
people of the state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#3:1:A>
To what extent it has has the integration of the state into the
Union <,> being possible ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#4:1:A>
And what have been the deficiency <,> in this <,> uh process of
integration itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#5:1:A>
And perhaps <,,> uh to examine these <,> uh major question to which
we must <O> one word </O> others <,> if we are ever to find the solution to
problems <,> that faces us <,> uh in the state <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#6:1:A>
We could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#7:1:A>
To my left is Prof <,,> A R Punjabi <,,> a well known law scholar
<,> from Kashmir University

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#8:1:A>
Who is currently associated with <,> uh the JNU <,> uh in <,> New
Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#9:1:A>
To the left of him <,> Prof C P Bhambri <,,> a well known
constitutional expert and political scientist also from <,> JNU <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#10:1:A>
And <,,> to his left <,> Prof Ravindra Kumar <,> Historian <,> and
Director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and <,> Library <,> New Dehli <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#11:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> uh start at the beginning <,> and go back to the
whole <,> issue of <,> the accession itself before we come down to the
problems of <,,> uh the present <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#12:1:A>
At present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh <,,> the accession
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#13:1:A>
Professor Punjabi <,> if I may put it to you this way <,> to what
extent do you think <,> that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian
Union in October nineteen forty-seven <,> to what extent did it have the
consent of the <,> people of the state <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#14:1:B>
Well you see this accession took place under various <,,>
special and typical circumstances <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#15:1:B>
On fifteenth of August when two dominion came into existence that
India and Pakistan <,,> people of Kashmir were too <,,> struggling to have
<,,> uh their own government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#16:1:B>
They wanted to <,> end the autocratic rule of Maharaja Hari Singh
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#17:1:B>
And uh <,> they <}> <-> want </-> <+> wanted </+> </}> to speak
with someone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#18:1:B>
And the struggle was going on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#19:1:B>
Well in this Independence Act <,> provided the opportunity to <,>
the the Prince State <,> to accede to the either domain <,> India or Pakistan
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#20:1:B>
But the Maharaj of Kashmir was undecided on this issue

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#21:1:B>
He did not <,> decide and uh <,> he asked for time

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#22:1:B>
In the mean time <,,> he asked for a <O> one word </O> agreement
<,> which was agreed to uh Pakistan and <,,> India wanted some time and some
clarifications <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#23:1:B>
In the mean time when <,> all these things were going on <,> there
was suddenly a tribal attack <,,> from <-> the </-> across the border of
Pakistan on Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#24:1:B>
So this created a <O> one word </O> situation <,,> whereby some
decision had to be taken <,,> and <,,> uh states defence was involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#25:1:B>
But at the same time <,,> it was not the question of <indig>
Maharaja </indig> alone <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#26:1:B>
There was <,> a very popular political party <,> who had launched
the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#27:1:B>
So therefore <,,> uh the accession took place under these
circumstances <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#28:1:A>
Prof Ravindrakumar if I may just uh <,> get to you as a
Historian <,> how do you <,> uh visualize in this prospect <,> the <,>
struggle in Jammu and Kashmir of the National Conference <,> of uh Sheikh
Abdullah <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#29:1:A>
I mean <}> <-> <.> ho </.> </-> <=> where </=> </}> is this placed
in the history of our freedom struggle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#30:1:A>
In other words <,> I mean is there a link between the struggle that
was going on in Jammu and Kashmir <,> and the struggle in rest <,> rest of
India <,> for liberation from British rule

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#31:1:C>
Of course there is a very close and integral link

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#32:1:C>
And <,> I would like to add one or two observations by way of foot
note to what <,> my friend Riaz has already said <,> in this regard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#33:1:C>
I think the people of Jammu and Kashmir <,> under the leadership of
Sheikh Abdullah <,> were fighting on two fronts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#34:1:C>
They were fighting the autocratic government <,> of the ruling
dynasty at the time <,> and the same time <,> they were fighting the British
in Kashmir <,> as do the rest <,> of South Asia <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#35:1:C>
So that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the
aegis of Sheikh Abdullah <,> and the National Conference party of those <,>
particular days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#36:1:C>
I think it is important to remember that at the same time as <,>
the State acceeded to the Indian Union <,> a popular government <,> under the
leadership of Sheikh Abdullah was created <,> in Shrinagar the capital of the
state of Jammu and Kashmir

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#37:1:C>
So that <,> both the struggles in a way <,> came to a successful
conclusion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#38:1:C>
But uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was
given <,,> by the uh <,,> government in New Delhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#39:1:C>
As was true <,> in the case of all sub-states say like Junagadh <,>
or Hyderabad <,> that the <,> will <,> that the decision of the ruler <,>
would be backed at the later stage <,> by an expression of will <,> by the
people of that state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#40:1:C>
And I think this <,> in a way would make the accession <,> truly
<O> one word </O> <,> and truly firm <,> as was done in subsequent years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#41:1:A>
Prof Bhambri uh <,> but don't you think I mean on the basis of
what <,,> uh Ravindra just said <,> do you think that though something you
see over and above distance uh <,> accession in human history <,> there were
certain special circumstances <,> which uh <,> the other just explained

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#42:1:A>
And I think <,> uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact
that you see Jammu and Kashmir was treated on a seperate footing <,,> and the
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined <,> in a
special status for Jammu and Kashmir

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#43:1:A>
In a sense <,> give a very special status to the state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#44:1:A>
Some argue that that is the root <,> of the problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#45:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> say that this is something which would serve as a
model for the future <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#46:1:A>
Now where exactly do you think I mean what <,> uh if <,> uh was a
special feature <,> that were enshrined in the constitution <,> were both of
India as well as the constitution of the Jammu and Kashmir state <,> which
made <,> the the special status <,> or ensured the special status for Jammu
and Kashmir <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#47:1:D>
Chander as Ravindra Riaz have very clear pointed out <,> that
instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances <,,> to
provide first the <O> one word </O> foundations to confront the tribal
raiders <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#48:1:D>
At the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical
developments of <,> the content of struggle in <O> a few words </O> was
ignored <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#49:1:D>
They were always kept uppermost in mind <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#50:1:D>
And once this raiders issue is resolved <,> Jammu <,> and Kashmir
problem <,> not special <,> not particular <,> but specifically in the
context of historical development <,> would be taken care of <,> by the
constitutional makers of India <,> which were enshrined <,> under article
three hundred seventy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#51:1:D>
That is <,,> the provisions of accessions <,,> and with limited
powers of the central government <,,> especially on the defence and foreign
affairs <,> would be taken <-> of </-> care of by central government <,> and
later on <,> the democrate forces <,> in Jammu and Kashmir <,> as represented
by <,> the popular leaders under <,,> Sheikh Abdullah of National Conference
<,> would through their own democratic process <,> form a constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#52:1:D>
And that constitution will provide them with the <,> beginning of
democratic involvement of Kashmir society as far as the <,> and a larger
problems of Indian polity of democracy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#53:1:D>
Which was a construction of <,> democratic technique <,,> as part
of <,> constitutional <O> one or two word </O> <,> it was accomodation of
special history <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#54:1:D>
It was not a concession to call it even special <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#55:1:D>
Special means as a significant <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#56:1:D>
It was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate <O> one word </O>
of the historically marked struggle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#57:1:D>
And aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#58:1:D>
And hence establishment of democratic polity in Kashmir <,> as a
first step <,> is under this constitution

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#59:1:A>
I see that Riaz is getting impatient to <O> one word </O> also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#60:1:B>
See I think uh <,> we would like to push we should I think
take note of two important things that one <,,> in nineteen fifty <,> when
the constitution of India was promolgated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#61:1:B>
Now we have article one of the constitution of India which define
the critical situation of India

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#62:1:A>
Right <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#63:1:B>
So by virtue of article one <,> of Indian constitution <,,>
Jammu and Kashmir state was placed in a part B state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#64:1:B>
Because there were A B C D four categories of states <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#65:1:B>
And Jammu and Kashmir fell in the category of part B state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#66:1:B>
Uh that is those states which were not directly <,> uh cannot have
the impression <?> of paramouncy </?> but uh <,> while the <,> result of the
process <,> of integration <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#67:1:B>
And in nineteen fifty-six of course in category B state were
abolished so <,> Jammu and Kashmir state fell in the category of part A state
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#68:1:B>
<w> That's </w> one part of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#69:1:B>
Second part of it article three seventy <,,> which guarantee
special status under the <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#70:1:B>
Now <,,> as far as article one <,> and is concerned uhm <,>
precisely because that article one was being debated in the Constituent
Assembly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#71:1:B>
Uh B R Ambedkar said that <,> there is one special feature about
article one Indian constitution that <,> Indian Union is not a volantary
union <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#72:1:B>
Secondly that <,> no unit has the right to secede from the Union
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#73:1:B>
So keeping you <,,> in mind that have article one <,> whether this
Jammu Kashmir state and the Indian Union <,,> one

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#74:1:B>
Second is this <,,> what <,> became perhaps <,,> the uh at the root
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders <,> was the extent
of other constitutional <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#75:1:B>
Because <,> after <,> determining the relationship constitutional
relationship by means of article one <,,> of the Indian Constitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#76:1:B>
Uh then just as this is quantum relationship <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#77:1:B>
But I think uh <,,> the quantum <?> relationship </?> was not fully
defined to what was the problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#78:1:B>
I think there was <,> some difference of perception <,> as well <,>
as for as the quantum relationship is concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#79:1:B>
You know because I <w> I'm </w> refering to article one because <,>
very often that it is made important point of view often <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#80:1:B>
And I think that it is perhaps in this context then <,> George <?>
Corobel </?> wrote the book <,> uh <mention> Danger in Kashmir </mention>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#81:1:B>
He was member of <,> <mention> UNCIP United Nation Commission India
and Pakistan </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#82:1:B>
He said <quote> it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue
before Security Council <,> either India or Pakistan </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#83:1:B>
That is perhaps the <,> <O> two words </O> has report the article
one <,> one was recognised <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#84:1:D>
Sorry for <?> minor </?> interruption <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#85:1:D>
The this question on article one in the Constitution not only by Dr
Ambedkar remaining others <,,> also showed awareness of some of this
secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country
also <,> especially North-East India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#86:1:D>
So the assurance was given to everyone <,> including Jammu and
Kashmir the secessions <?> are rejected </?> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#87:1:B>
Uhm yeah <{> <[> but it is not </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#88:1:A>
<[> Yeah I I think </[> </{> I think this is an important
point the one which <w> you're </w> making but I will also refer back to the
<,> question of Kashmir having a special status

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#89:1:D>
I don't think Kashmir had any special status at all in the
sense that <O> one word </O> state throughout the country there was an
understanding by the national status who came to power in <,> New Delhi on
the fifteenth of August <,> nineteen forty-seven

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#90:1:D>
When the popular will <,> of those who live in the princely state
<,> would be affected <,> in the case of Kashmir <,> uh article three seventy
went as far as saying <,> that in actual Constituent Assembly within the
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the
relationship <,> between Kashmir and the rest of the Indian Union <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#91:1:D>
Finally I would think that when that Constituent Assembly made its
announcement <,> in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#92:1:D>
Those announcement as <,> has been suggested by Riaz and <O> one
word </O> Shah but <O> two words </O> developing <,> and changing <,> uh
announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#93:1:D>
It was seen as a revolving <,> situation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#94:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> transgressing my role as moderator but I can't do
not quite agree <,> what your <,> observation on uh you know there have not
been a special status

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#95:1:A>
Because after all you see article three seventy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#96:1:A>
And <,> you see from the <,> things that are enshrined in it uh
such as there being a separate uhm <,> constitution for Jammu and Kashmir

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#97:1:A>
And some other <,> some symbol of uh <,> that that is there <,> a
separate emblem <,> uh separate flag and uh

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#98:1:D>
Of course

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#99:1:A>
No <,> no I think you see these were uhm <,> uh has was wasn't
concession it as I said earlier <,> see this could <,> uh many people argue
that this could serve as a model for for their for their future

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#100:1:A>
There have been demands from other parts of the country <,> that
article three seventy should be extended to other places <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#101:1:A>
On the other hand there is other tendency which says that this <->
is </-> three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a
special <,> relationship with Kashmir the integration of Kashmir <,> with the
main stream of India was never <,> uh complete

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#102:1:C>
Chander uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#103:1:A>
Uh how would you uh <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#104:1:C>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#105:1:C>
But I honestly want to say <indig> ke </indig> <w> you're
</w> misunderstanding my position

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#106:1:C>
What <w> I'm </w> saying is the communality lay <,> in the
declaration of the New Delhi leaders <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#107:1:C>
That the <w> people's </w> voice would be consulted throughout the
region of princely states you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#108:1:C>
Of course <,> the very fact that a Constituent Assembly was given
to <,> the people of Jammu and Kashmir means giving them <,> uh a special
status but that special status doesnot at all consent <,> that the place <,>
of Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir <,> within the Indian Union or the <?>
inter-media </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-037#109:1:A>
Of course <,> certainly <,> certainly not

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#110:1:A>
But uh what the focus of <,> uh what <w> we've </w> brought
perhaps I think you know <,> is the time we suspect <,> has come to see what
<w> we've </w> seen as <,> uh happening in Kashmir over the last few years

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#111:1:A>
Actually I think uhm <,> very <,> very sad because in a sense that
Kashmir <,> uh state have a special place in the heart of <,> most Indians

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#112:1:A>
And to see <w> what's </w> happened <,> to the Valley <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#113:1:A>
<w> It's </w> something which <,> you know pain <,> all uh <,,>
those committed to Democracy and federalism in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#114:1:A>
And considering that those indeed certain special provision made
for Jammu and Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#115:1:A>
Why ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-037#116:1:A>
Why did this happen I mean <}> <-> what </-> <+> where </+> </}>
really we went wrong </I>
