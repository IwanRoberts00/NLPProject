<ICE-IND:S1A-025#6:1:A>
And uh you <O> one word </O> <,> last week when uh you came
from your own place <,> from the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#7:1:B>
Yes yes I came from <,> uh Nelambur

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#8:1:A>
Nelambur

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#9:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#10:1:A>
Oh then Nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#11:1:B>
Ah northern part of Kerala

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#12:1:A>
Northern <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#13:1:C>
But it is a border district I believe

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#14:1:B>
<w> It's </w> border district

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#15:1:A>
Between Karnataka <{> <[> and uh </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#16:1:B>
<[> Between Karnataka </[> </{> and Tamil Nadu

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#17:1:A>
Oh I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#18:1:B>
So <w> I'm </w> teaching there <,> uh in one of the <,> uh
private college

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#19:1:C>
Uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#20:1:A>
Yes I teach in <,> in some higher secondary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#21:1:A>
But basically I am a mathematics teacher but <,> uh in my school I
teach uh English

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#22:1:C>
Oh ho ho <w> it's </w> fantastic job you are doing no <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#23:1:A>
<w> It's </w> <,> <w> it's </w> a rainy season <,> in our
place <,> and we have plenty of rain this year <,,> so our <,> crops uh
agricultural crops are <,,> very good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#24:1:A>
Then what about you <,> sir uh in your village <,> is it a village
or town ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#25:1:B>
Yes <w> it's </w> a village <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#26:1:A>
<w> It's </w> village

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#27:1:B>
Not uh big town a small town <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#28:1:A>
<w> What's </w> the main cultivation there <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#29:1:B>
<w> It's </w> paddy <,> <{1> <[1> and <,> then uh <,> rubber
<,> <{2> <[2> rubber <,> and uh <,> maize <,> <w> that's </w> all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#30:1:A>
<[1> And </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#31:1:A>
<[2> Rubber </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#32:1:C>
Uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#33:1:C>
Usually in <.> Ke </.> Kottayam is supposed to be the <,> I mean uh
<,,> a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#34:1:A>
So you get uh <,,> more income

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#35:1:C>
But you know the <.> pro </.> uh recent uh trends <,,> because
now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up <,> now the good
prices are <{> <[> not </[> coming

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#36:1:A>
<[> Oh <w> that's </w> </[> </{> everywhere in Kerala <,> we
can't uh

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#37:1:C>
<w> That's </w> it

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#38:1:C>
But the only advantage

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#39:1:A>
We can't help it because the population

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#40:1:C>
Only advantage is that uh <,> rubber is now enjoying a basic
price or something like that in a fixed price <,> which is uh almost good

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#41:1:B>
Not that bad

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#42:1:C>
So but actually we still remember the day <O> one word </O>
years till a few years back <,> Kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh
places even in the whole of India <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#43:1:A>
Yeah <w> that's </w> right

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#44:1:C>
And you know educationally <,> culturally <,> by all means and
you know <,> uh or uh our area <,> I mean the <.> who </.> the whole place
<w> it's </w> almost cultivable cultivated and uh <,> we have access by roads
<,> trains and <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#45:1:C>
So we cannot say that it is in a <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#46:1:C>
We have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#47:1:A>
Uh ours is a remote area and our <{> <[> people </[> <,> uh
yes hilly area

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#48:1:A>
Our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products <,>
uh like uh pepper <,> paddy <,> uh then coffee <,> coffee seeds <,> uh tea
plantations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#49:1:A>
These are the main crops we <,> we <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#50:1:C>
<[> Hilly region </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#51:1:C>
You have

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#52:1:A>
Yeah we have <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#53:1:A>
And uh <,> educationally our area is very <,> backward

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#54:1:C>
Ah uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#55:1:A>
Because most of the people <,,> uh migrate to from southern
part of Kerala <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#56:1:B>
But they must be <,> uh be belonging to some <,> I mean uh
good I mean families no <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#57:1:A>
They <O> a few words </O> we don't have enough uh facilities
<{> <[> for education and or plant rotation </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#58:1:C>
<[> Facilities that should be arranged </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#59:1:A>
<O> One word </O> is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#60:1:A>
And uh <,,> a very good percentage of our <,> population <,,> is uh
<,> uh tribe <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#61:1:A>
So <,> they are backwardly you know they are <,> educationally and
socially they are backward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#62:1:A>
Actually they don't <,> want to <,> live with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#63:1:A>
They want uh their own lives as it is

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#64:1:C>
Ah I still remember <,> I was told by some social workers <,>
that whenever <,> the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal
people <,> they are show their uh uhm what to say <,> uh unwillingness to
come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#65:1:B>
Yes yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#66:1:C>
Now there are various projects I think <,> to give them for
<{> <[> a main stream </[> even then you know I personally don't uh uh agree
with many of the policy because you know <,> one way we are destroying their
natural habitat

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#67:1:A>
<[> Yes uh there are uh yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#68:1:A>
Uh where they are used to

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#69:1:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#70:1:A>
Yes <w> that's </w> true <w> that's </w> true

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#71:1:C>
And you know the days are gone when we could see we could
think of <,> uh people bringing honey etcetra from the <,> forest and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#72:1:A>
Forest and uh they had a very good <,,> life

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#73:1:C>
Ah yeah <,> they have their own cultural I mean we destroyed
everything anyway whatever it is

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#74:1:C>
So one way <w> it's </w> a good <,> I mean when we think about uh
this one of government policies are concerned <,> government have to bring
all the people to the <,,> main stream or whatever it is <,> and uh uh what
time you have come ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#75:1:B>
Uh today

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#76:1:C>
What about your job and uh <,,> family in Nelambur sir ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#77:1:B>
Yes uh <,> as I told you everyting

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#78:1:C>
You belong to that particular district

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#79:1:B>
No no I belong actually to <,> uh Yernala district

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#80:1:C>
Oh ho from Yernala

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#81:1:B>
You see <w> I'm </w> settled in Nelambur

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#82:1:A>
Uh then how do you <O> a few words </O> work <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#83:1:B>
Yeah my field of work is uh <,> I teach I told you know I was
I am teaching in one of the private colleges <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#84:1:B>
You see we don't have uh <,> <{> <[> <w> it's </w> run by you <,,>
<w> it's </w> run by me

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#85:1:C>
<[> <w> It's </w> run by you </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#86:1:C>
Ah ha ha

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#87:1:B>
We don't have uh many <,> regular colleges or <,> any <,> high
schools run by the government or <,,> recognised by the government and
nominated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#88:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a migrated area

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#89:1:A>
Yes <,> so this a boon <,> your step <w> it's </w> a boon to
your <,> uh progress and your people

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#90:1:B>
In a way you can say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#91:1:A>
You provide certain education facilities for them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#92:1:B>
Yeah uh <,> see I am actually running a parallel college <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#93:1:A>
A parallel college

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#94:1:B>
Yes ah a parallel college

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#95:1:C>
And uh who else is there to assist <,> you some other teachers
or employees

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#96:1:B>
Ah to assist there some teachers are there <,> and uh together
we conduct the classes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#97:1:B>
And there are many people <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> many people <,>
because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh
many in our area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#98:1:B>
You see this parallel colleges they run a group

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#99:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#100:1:A>
Yes of course

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#101:1:A>
But still I have a doubt uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#102:1:A>
Actually these parallel colleges uh <,,> are the main reasons for
the <,> uh melting of so many <,,> graduates in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#103:1:A>
And uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment
uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#104:1:B>
And uh after getting education they don't want actually to do
other work <,> <{> <[> other work <,,> uh like uh <,> what uhm you call <.>
aga </.> agriculture

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#105:1:A>
<[> Other work </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#106:1:A>
Yes especially the Indians have the <{> <[> uh </[> <,> uh
tendency to keep away from <,> parrallel work and uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#107:1:B>
<[> Tendency </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#108:1:B>
Ah parallel work yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#109:1:A>
Everybody wants a white collar job

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#110:1:B>
White collar job

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#111:1:A>
Yes this uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#112:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a big problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#113:1:B>
So we have uh what you call this uh <,> unemployment problem <,,>
uh in our uh place <,> in plenty

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#114:1:B>
So people <,> wanted to go abroad in search of jobs <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#115:1:A>
Not only in your place everywhere in India <{> <[> these
these </[> unemployment problem

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#116:1:C>
<[> Ah yes uh </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#117:1:C>
The tendency to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#118:1:A>
So they seek <,,> job in other countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#119:1:A>
But uh <,> to go abroad uh it is very difficult <O> one or two
words </O> because uh <,> the problem of language <,> the financial
background everything comes in the way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#120:1:A>
Uh uh when we talk about these things <,,> uh what do you feel
about the <,> standard <,,> of English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#121:1:A>
Is it necessary <,> these English education is <.> necess </.> is
it necessary in our country ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#122:1:B>
So <w> that's </w> a <O> one word </O> <w> I'm </w> a strong
uhm <,> arguer <,> for the <.> main </.> maintenance of good standard of
English throughout <,> uh across this life

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#123:1:A>
Yes yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#124:1:B>
<}> <-> Because </-> </=> because </=> </}> the reason is
that <w> it's </w> a world language you know <,> and

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#125:1:C>
And uh and uh language see in India in particular <,> if a
country like ours <,> we need uh what you call a link language

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#126:1:A>
Because uh <,> our country has a <,> multi uh <,> <{> <[>
lingual background <,,> lingual background

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#127:1:C>
<[> Lingual background </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#128:1:A>
Every state has uh <,> their own languages <,> so in order to
communicate with them <,> uh I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#129:1:B>
We must have uh a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#130:1:A>
Link languages <,> and we usually depend on <,> this English

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#131:1:B>
Or in other words <,> uh if you don't know English <,> if you
want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh
ten fifteen languages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#132:1:B>
Whereas if you know English you could serve <,> I mean it could
serve your <,> purpose throughout India and even outside the world

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#133:1:C>
But actually the politicians spoil the <O> one or two words
</O> <,> I think so <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#134:1:B>
Yes they actually spread the regionalism <,> communalism and
all

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#135:1:C>
Because they have uh their own uh motives you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#136:1:C>
They have their own personal motives <,,> uhm they have to <,,>
stand <,,> for I mean their survival

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#137:1:A>
Uh their survival <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#138:1:C>
And uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot
<,,> have any thing to <,,> to go to the people <,,> uhm I mean again for
something else or so <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#139:1:B>
So I think there are two sets of people I think <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#140:1:B>
One is favouring <,> uh this uh <,> English language and there are
other people who are

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#141:1:A>
Those <w> who're </w> against them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#142:1:B>
Against <,> them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#143:1:A>
Yes <w> that's </w> true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#144:1:A>
But when we consider the facts <,,> uh we are supposed to follow
<,> this English language as long as <,> uh we have another link language

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#145:1:C>
Link language yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#146:1:A>
<w> That's </w> very <,> important

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#147:1:C>
Important <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#148:1:C>
But not only that <,> for our higher studies uh purposes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#149:1:A>
<O> One word </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#150:1:C>
If you want to <,> go through any <,> material <,,> this is
the only uh <,> language by which we can communicate

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#151:1:C>
Uh I mean <,,> uh <w> we'll </w> get the only material in English
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#152:1:C>
In especially higher <,> <{> <[> upper higher school <,,> higher
level <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#153:1:A>
<[> Upper higher school </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#154:1:B>
What about the cultural uh uh <,> background in your place do
your people still <,> uh maintain that uh traditional cultural programmes <,>
like Kathakali Turgal etcetra in your place ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#155:1:C>
Yes they do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#156:1:C>
But even they are on the decline no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#157:1:B>
It is very you know in our place you know many of the items
are not uh there <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#158:1:A>
But it is because of the influence of this uh city culture
you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#159:1:A>
They are always after these <,> uh so called modernism <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#160:1:B>
Yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our
childhood you know <,> even uh my own <,> I mean the school where I studied
our <,> I mean usual <,> uh uniform was the very much traditional Kerala
<indig> mundu </indig> and uh shirt <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#161:1:C>
Now most of the schools in have changed to <,> uh uh <O> one
word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#162:1:C>
But I I feel it has become an inevitable uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#163:1:A>
That truth uh <,> and we blindly follow <,> the tradition of
uh European people uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#164:1:B>
But does this mean that you know

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#165:1:C>
My sir I mean my guess is that you know people must have uh
<,> chosen a convenient way <,> rather than uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#166:1:A>
No I don't think how can it be a convenient way because <,>
uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#167:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a <O> one word </O> you mean uh <,> that <w>
it's </w> not at all suited for <w> Kerala's </w> climate uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#168:1:B>
One way <w> it's </w> true

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#169:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not hygenic especially during the month of June July

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#170:1:B>
But you know still <,> more than that uh <,> <O> cough </O> sorry
there is an element of uh <,> imitation or uh going after the <,> uh foreign
traditions in every country <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#171:1:A>
Yes of course we can follow the language <,> European
languages <,> I mean this English

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#172:1:A>
But <{> <[> the practice being </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#173:1:C>
<[> But the practice </[> </{> if we follow their culture uh
tradition <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#174:1:B>
But you know <,> see anyway English study is that has brought
a <,> number of good things to India and <,> whatever it is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#175:1:A>
Yes <,,> then

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#176:1:B>
I see what about the cultural no <,> see the cultural uh <,>
programmes and other items <,> uh Mr Joy you said that uh the <,> <w> there's
</w> a decline in your part

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#177:1:C>
Yeah sure

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#178:1:B>
And uh what is the reason behind it

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#179:1:C>
Actually there the thing is that you know for example
Kathakali art I mean this <,> uh uhm cultural items like Kathakali Turgal <,>
it needs a life time <,> I mean uh mean practice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#180:1:C>
For example six or seven years to master

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#181:1:A>
Ha true

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#182:1:C>
And you know <}> <-> nobody is </-> <=> nobody is </=> </}>
that patient enough to practice it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#183:1:B>
Even from our area know <,> <w> it's </w> entirely different
know <,> that people they like <,> they wanted to study all these uh old uh
things <,> older things you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#184:1:A>
Uh not only that uh <,> usually these days the people have a
tendency to look down upon such a traditional <,> <{> <[> yeah yeah <,,> uh
programme you know traditional <,,> uh cultural programmes of

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#185:1:C>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#186:1:B>
I see

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#187:1:A>
That is the one of the main reason <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#188:1:C>
Uh people always go after pop music <,> uh dance cabarait
dance <,> uh and all <}> <-> those </-> <=> those </=> </}> things <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#189:1:A>
Of course this is well and good but should we <,,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> <w> that's </w> not uh our own <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#190:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-025#191:1:B>
But in our area it is totally different

<ICE-IND:S1A-025#192:1:B>
I think uh now people have <,> uh more liking or you can say <,>
they love to learn <,> uh Kathakali Bharatnatyam and uh see people do </I>
