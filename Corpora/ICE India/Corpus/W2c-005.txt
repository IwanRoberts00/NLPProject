<h> Traffic chaos at Rajinder Ngr crossing </h> <O> drawing </O>

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#16:2>
<bold> By a <@AS> Staff Reporter {#} </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#17:2>
For many days commuters at the Shankar road Rajinder Nagar
crossing are having great problems as the traffic lights are not working at
the intersection.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#18:2>
The lights in the area are generally switched on well after 8 am
the chaos can be well imagined since the area has a high rate of vehicular
traffic due to presence of a school in the vicinity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#19:2>
A few weeks back the area around the traffic lights was dug up to
lay some MTNL cables and the lights were uprooted.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#20:2>
Despite the fact that the uprooted lights stayed unattended for
almost four days no effort was made by the traffic police to substitute the
traffic lights by a <}> <-> policemen </-> <+> policeman </+> </}> who
could ensure that the vehicles at the crossing <}> <-> moves </-> <+> move
</+> </}> smoothly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#21:2>
Even after the dug up area was filled and the traffic lights
reinstalled they have yet to start functioning.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#22:2>
Yesterday morning speeding buses on the main Shankar Road made it
extremely difficult for the traffic from inside the colony to come on to the
main road.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#23:2>
The chaos takes dangerous dimensions since in the morning a large
number of TSRs and other vehicles carrying school going children are forced
to zig zag their way through the speeding buses.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#24:2>
The surprising part is that a mere 100 metres away at the Ridge road
Shankar road round-about as many as four policemen are stationed
completely ignoring the chaos that is developing at a stone throwing
distance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#25:2>
Although traffic police claims that the <}> <-> nonfucting </->
<+> <?> nonfunctioning </?> </+> </}> lights are put to order within minutes
of their going wrong, the lights in this crossing seems to have been
totally overlooked.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#26:2>
The traffic police must realise that with the presence of school in
the colony the volume of traffic that tries to enter the colony or leave it
is substantial and the lights and the traffic at the intersection must be
regularised to ensure that no traffic mishaps occur. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#27:2>
Would the DCP traffic Maxwell Pereira please do the needful and
ensure that chaos does not reign supreme at the intersection and, even if the
lights start functioning, station traffic policemen for the sake of the
children and general public who commute the area, at least during the rush
hours. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#31:3>
There were hardly a dozen floats witnessed at the Saturday
evening Carnival parade here.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#32:3>
However the traffic arrangements were so poor that there were <}> <->
intermitant </-> <+> intermittent </+> </}> traffic jams along the route.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#33:3>
The organisation was equally bad, for the parade scheduled at 4
p.m. was held up by about 2 hours, near the Mapusa courts building.

<ICE-IND:W2C-005#34:3>
Possibly they were testing the patience of the only one thousand
and odd domestic and foreign <}> <-> tourist </-> <+> tourists </+> </}> who
had gathered there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#35:3>
Unlike in previous years for the first time, the Carnival floats
were taken out on Saturday evening at Mapusa while there was a similar parade
at Panjim city on the same day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#36:3>
The organisers <-> , </-> seemed to be almost lost, when the
programme was nearing the end. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#37:3>
After a long time it was decided to converge at the Gandhi
<indig> Chowk </indig> thereby further paralysing the transport from and
to Mapusa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-005#38:3>
Although prizes for the best three were announced, no on was
