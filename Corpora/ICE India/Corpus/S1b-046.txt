<ICE-IND:S1B-046#1:1:A>
Today <w> we've </w> <,> Prof H K Das <,> in the studios <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#2:1:A>
And <,,> we will uh enter into discussion with Prof H K Das <,,> on
various aspects of uh <,,> modern research which is going on in the Biology
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#3:1:A>
Prof Das <,,> is Director <,> of Genetic Engineering Unit <,> in
Jawaharlal Nehru University <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#4:1:A>
And currently <,> he is the chairman <,> of <,,> uh Centre for
Biotechnology <,> in the same university that is Jawaharlal Nehru University
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#5:1:A>
Prof Das <,> I would like to ask you <,> what is uh <,,> the
background or the history <,> of Genetic Engineering Research <,> in India
<,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#6:1:B>
Yes uh bb I think it will be <,> interesting to trace back the
history <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#7:1:B>
Uhm <,> you see somewhere around nineteen <,> eighty-two <,> uh Prof
M G K Menon <,> had called <,> some of the Biologists <,> of the country <,>
uh <,> for a meeting at Baroda <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#8:1:B>
Trying to discuss <,> as to <,> what are the areas that <,> should
receive thrust <,,> for research in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#9:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> where uh people like us <,> uh had emphasised
<,> that uh <,> we are <,> running out of time and we should initiate genetic
engineering research in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#10:1:B>
You see prior to that <,> uh the science administrators <,> had
always felt that genetic engineering <,> is too sophisticated and uh <,> it
cannot be done in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#11:1:B>
It can be done only in the highly developed countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#12:1:B>
But <,> we we could convince Prof Menon that there is nothing <,>
nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology
<,> and it can very well be done <,> uh in our country

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#13:1:B>
Uh and <,> he didn't take long <,> to understand the point <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#14:1:B>
And uh <,> it was decided that the Department of <,> Science and
Technology uh <,> should start some core research units <,> uh to <,> to
initiate genetic engineering research in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#15:1:B>
Uh <,> applications were invited and uh <,> <w> that's </w> how <,>
<-> a </-> three <,> units were established

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#16:1:B>
One <,> in the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore <,> uhm
another in Bose Institute Calcutta <,> and the third one in Jawaharlal Nehru
University <,> in Delhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#17:1:B>
Later another unit was added and uh <,> that was uh <,> in Madurai
<,> Kamraj University

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#18:1:B>
Uh <,> the purpose was that <,> they should serve as a focal point
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#19:1:B>
So that <,> people from the nearby area could come and learn the
techniques <,> and genetic engineering research <,> can spread in the country
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#20:1:B>
Uh you know this has worked very well

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#21:1:B>
Now <,> almost <,> in all <,> good biological laboratories in the
country <,> genetic engineering is being used <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#22:1:B>
But <w> that's </w> how the whole thing was started <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#23:1:A>
Uh coming to the next one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#24:1:A>
In fact I wanted to ask you after this <,> brief background which
is not a very <,> long history for genetic engineering to start in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#25:1:A>
Eighty-two is not far off <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#26:1:A>
What is the current status of genetic engineering research <,> uh
in India or in <,> <w> it's </w> labs of India <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#27:1:B>
Uh uh <,> the current status uh <,> is is a very encouraging I
must say

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#28:1:B>
And uh <,> uhm if I may go back again uhm <,> to what I was saying

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#29:1:B>
Uh <,> each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh
<,> was uh <,> entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic
engineering research <,> in the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#30:1:B>
Uhm <,> uhm the unit in <,> Jawaharlal Nehru University was
supposed to work on <,> uh the molecular genetic of nitrogen fixation <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#31:1:A>
You have mentioned that your unit <,,> of which you are the
director <,> is endowed with the <,> responsibility of uh carrying out
research <,> on nitrogen fixation

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#32:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#33:1:A>
So uh <,> will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen
fixation ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#34:1:A>
Because we keep hearing about <,> nitrogen fixing <,> <{1> <[1> yes
<,> microbe <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,> and perhaps they have some other

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#35:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#36:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#37:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#38:1:B>
The the <,,> meaning of nitrogen fixation chemically <,> uh is
reduction of a molecular nitrogen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#39:1:B>
And uh when I was a student or you were a student <,> <w> we've
</w> heard about the Hoberbosh process <,> <{1> <[1> yeah <,> of uh <,>
industrially reducing nitrogen

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#40:1:B>
Uh <,> but uh <,> you know there are micro-organisms <,> who can
also reduce nitrogen on that

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#41:1:B>
Reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#42:1:B>
You don't have to <,> go very high <,> uh in the temperature or
pressure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#43:1:B>
And this micro-organisms <,> uh reduce nitrogen <,> and form amonia
and its derivatives <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#44:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> what <,> is biological nitrogen fixation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#45:1:B>
And I don't have to <,> uh overemphasis the importance of this
because <,> uh uh this is the only source of all nitrogenous compounds <,> in
the living world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#46:1:B>
Like the meat or fish we consume today <,> though <,> uh the the
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen <,> they live on plants <,> <{2> <[2>
right <,> and and the plants cannot fix nitrogen <,> so they get the nitrogen
fixed from the microbes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#47:1:B>
So <-> so bb </-> this fixed nitrogen <,> is is the only biological
source in addition to of course the industrially <,> fixed nitrogen

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#48:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#49:1:A>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#50:1:A>
Fixed nitrogen

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#51:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#52:1:A>
So these nitrogen fixtures <,> as you say are microbes and
your work <,> is also related to them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#53:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#54:1:A>
So uh there may be many <,> types of uh <,> <{> <[> nitrogen
fixing or of many types </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#55:1:B>
<[> Sure there are many there are many types </[> </{> uh uhm
<,> if I may classify them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#56:1:B>
Uh generally speaking <}> <-> <.> wa </.> </-> <=> you </=> </}>
could <,> uh uh group them <,> in <-> a </-> <,,> classes like <,> symbiotic
nitrogen fixation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#57:1:B>
Uh which means that <,> the micro-organisms by themselves <,>
cannot fix nitrogen but they must <,> uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement
<,> with a particular plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#58:1:B>
Uh uhm <,> and the genous risobium <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> and uh <w>
I'm </w> sure this is a very familiar name <,> uh is is the one which does it
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#59:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#60:1:B>
So uh <,> the genous the various species of risobium <,> would
enter into symbiotic relationship <,> with various <,> leguminous plants <,>
except <{> <[> for one or two plants </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#61:1:A>
<[> For one or two plants </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#62:1:A>
By <.> legu </.> excuse me by leguminous plants you mean <,>
the pulses

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#63:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#64:1:A>
Uh uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#65:1:B>
Leguminous plants <,> uh uh are <,> are the pulses <{> <[> <O>
one word </O> yeah and uh since <,> India is uh a a big <,> vegetarian uh <,>
diet consuming <,> uh country <,> the pulses are very important source of <,>
uh nitrogen

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#66:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#67:1:A>
Nitrogen or protein <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#68:1:B>
Even if one is a non-vegetarian <,> because the cost of
non-vegetarian food is very high

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#69:1:B>
So <,> the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian
dishes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#70:1:B>
And the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#71:1:A>
So these risobia <,,> they uh <,> enter into an association
<,> with these leguminous plants

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#72:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#73:1:A>
And then <-> the <,> what have </-> what is the benefit of
that association

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#74:1:B>
I will tell you

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#75:1:B>
The form what you call <,> nodules <,> which can be very small or
slightly big <,> in the roots <,> of these plants

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#76:1:B>
And some stray instances of shoot <,> or stem nodules also

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#77:1:B>
But generally speaking root nodules <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#78:1:B>
And as a result <,> uh a lot of <,> fix nitrogen would be given to
the plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#79:1:B>
So that the legumes <,> uh would <}> <-> <.> fo </.> </-> <=> form
</=> </}> the crop <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#80:1:B>
Uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using <,> these bacterial
species <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#81:1:B>
Uh this is one kind uh

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#82:1:B>
There is another kind which we call <,> associative nitrogen
fixation <,> where the plant <,> uh would associate themselves with <->
micros </-> micro-organisms

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#83:1:B>
But there is no <,> uh uh rigid symbiotic arrangement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#84:1:B>
And that uh <,> kind of <.> syn </.> uh uh fixation of nitrogen
<,,> is very important for nonlegumes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#85:1:B>
The cereal plants for <{> <[> example </[> like <,> uh we rice <,>
rice etcetera

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#86:1:A>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#87:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#88:1:B>
And as a spirillum <,> this is one important genus <,> uh
which enters into association with cereal plants <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#89:1:B>
There could be a third class where there is no association <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#90:1:B>
The micro organisms can fix nitrogen <,> in a free living state

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#91:1:B>
Doesn't need any plant nothing <,> and as agrobactor <,> is an
example of the third class

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#92:1:B>
And <,,> today in India <,> both as a spirillum species and as
agrobactor species are used in the fields <,> for cereal plants to augument
the crop production

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#93:1:B>
And there is absolutely no doubt <,> that both these uh <,> impart
beneficial affect to cereal crop production <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#94:1:A>
Prof Das you are working on uh <,> <?> a agrobactor </?> <,>
uh on NDIE <,> <{> <[> uhm uhm <,> uh which is a free <,> living nitrogen
fixture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#95:1:A>
So why have you uh <,> selected this field <,> to work out its
genetics or bio fixing ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#96:1:B>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#97:1:B>
You see uh uh I <w> I'm I'm </w> basically a bio-chemist

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#98:1:B>
And uh <,> I I had been uh quite attracted by a agrobactor <,> uh
because of <,> uh mainly two reasons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#99:1:B>
One is that <,> though in general <,> this nitrogen fixation <,> a
machinery inside a cell <,> is very sensitive to oxygen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#100:1:B>
In agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air <,> in the <{> <[>
presence of oxygen </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#101:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#102:1:B>
So it has its own mechanism <,> by which it protects the
nitrogen fixation machinery <,> which is not there in other organisms

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#103:1:B>
Uh uh <,> some organisms can protect but only when some
specialised structures are formed

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#104:1:B>
But in agrobactor <,> the the cell by itself <,> does it

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#105:1:B>
This was <,> one very interesting point for us to get interest in
agrobactor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#106:1:B>
The other point was of course <,> that uh <,> we wanted to work
with something <,> that would be useful for cereal crops <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#107:1:B>
Uh because <w> that's </w> by far <,> uh the <,> uh the more
important crop in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#108:1:B>
Uhm <,> and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many
other interesting points in agrobactor as we have <,> worked with agrobactor
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#109:1:B>
Like it has <,> some alternative pathways of nitrogen fixation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#110:1:B>
Which uh <,> possibly is not there in the other conventional <,>
uh bacterial species

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#111:1:A>
So besides uh <,> this alternative <,> pathway for nitrogen
fixation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#112:1:A>
Uh what are the other uh unique findings <,> that have uh <,> uh
been done in your <,> lab ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#113:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#114:1:A>
Or in under <-> in </-> your directorship ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#115:1:B>
Sure <,> uh uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#116:1:A>
Or you can elaborate that this <{> <[> is the only thing
which contains everything itself </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#117:1:B>
<[> Yes if I can tell everything itself </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#118:1:B>
Yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#119:1:B>
Agrobactor we have learnt <-> the </-> <,> has another unique
character <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#120:1:B>
Uh and that is it has a huge amount of DNA in it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#121:1:B>
DNA as you know is the <,> is the genetic material <,> and uh <,>
uh for a bacteria <,> uh it is really huge

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#122:1:B>
Uh <,> the standard in bacteria is considered to be <,> the micro
organism <O> one word </O> which <,> all of us have in the <,> in organs

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#123:1:B>
<w> It's </w> friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#124:1:B>
And agrobactor has as much as forty times more DNA <,> in in its
single cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#125:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> <{> <[> what has attracted </[> our attention
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#126:1:A>
<[> Might have <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#127:1:B>
And we have recently uh uh <,> established that agrobactor
<O> one word </O> has <,> as many as eighty chromosomes in it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#128:1:B>
Which are almost the size <,> uh of an <O> one word </O>
chromosome <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#129:1:B>
But uh <,,> altogether eighty chromosomes <,> uh looks like all of
them are similar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#130:1:B>
And nobody knows why they are there <,> and what they are doing
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#131:1:B>
And this is what <,> is of interest to us <,> at this present
moment

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#132:1:B>
So in addition to the nitrogen <,> fixation uh <,> interest that
we have first agrobactor this is also another <,> interesting point uh <,>
that needs attention in agrobactor <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#133:1:A>
Uh these <,> microbes that <,> you have talked about <,,> are
also doing another job that is they are economising on the <,,> fertilizer
requirement <{> <[> of the crop </[> that means it has some <,> application
in agriculture

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#134:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> right </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#135:1:B>
Very much <,> so very much <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#136:1:A>
So uh can you please elaborate on <,> on those aspects <,>
<{> <[> <w> that's </w> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#137:1:B>
<[> You see </[> </{> uh uh <,> you see the most effective
<-> the </-> biological fertilizer is of course risobium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#138:1:B>
The effect that you get is is a <,> much more striking <,> in case
of risobium <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#139:1:B>
Uh but the problem with risobium is that <,> uh you can use it
only <,> for legumes

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#140:1:B>
Or the or the pulses

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#141:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#142:1:B>
Uh <indig> dals </indig> that we take <,> uh

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#143:1:B>
And <w> there's </w> absolutely no doubt that <,> it it brings up
yield <,> several wholes high <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#144:1:B>
But <,,> in the case of <O> one word </O> agrobactor <w> it's </w>
not as good as <,> as risobium

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#145:1:B>
But again <,> uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#146:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#147:1:B>
And for cereal crops <,> uh it has been established that <,>
uh again <w> it's </w> in the field <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#148:1:B>
Not not just in the lab <,> that uh <,> uh it it <,,> it gives an
yield somewhere <,> could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#149:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#150:1:B>
And for some <,,> fodder crops <,> the yield could be even
double <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#151:1:B>
And specifically only for fodder crops

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#152:1:B>
<{> <[> Using uhm agrobactor </[>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#153:1:B>
So you simply <,> uh inoculate the seed <,> with these bacteria
<,> and then sow the seed <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#154:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#155:1:B>
And there the <,> micro organisms multiply <,> and then
supply the nitrogen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#156:1:B>
And the other point is that it not only <,> uhm has the good
effect on that crop <,> the crop that comes next <,> also gets the benefit
because <,> some of the fix nitrogen stay on in the soil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#157:1:B>
And the next crop also <{> <[> getting gets </[> the benefit <,>
of this inoculation <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#158:1:A>
<[> Gets the benefit </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#159:1:A>
Uh since you are <,> uh heading such a <,> good <,,> and
dedicated <,> scientists team <,,> of genetic engineering unit <,,> uh there
previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#160:1:A>
Now we hear quite often of biotechnology <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#161:1:A>
Uh since you are an expert in this area <,> can you uh tell us <,>
uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap <,,> or they
are <,> one and the same thing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#162:1:B>
No uh <,> let me put it this way uh <,> Genetic Engineering
is included in biotechnology <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#163:1:B>
Uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today <,> I
dare say <,> is because of genetic engineering

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#164:1:B>
Because <,> biotechnology was there <,> like like the wine that
was there from the time immemorial

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#165:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#166:1:B>
You you you could consider it <,> as a biotechnological <,>
uh uh phenomenon <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> preparing a wine <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#167:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#168:1:B>
Or even <,> the <indig> gober </indig> gas that you hear so
much about <,> <{> <[> is biotechnology </[> uh but <,> <w> it's </w> the
genetic engineering <,> uh development of genetic engineering that has given
a real boost to biotechnology <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#169:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#170:1:B>
Uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but
biotechnology <,> uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#171:1:B>
Which is also very important today <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#172:1:B>
Like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#173:1:B>
And those are disease free plants <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#174:1:B>
And there there is no genetic engineering <,> but thats included
in biotechnology <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#175:1:B>
Or or even this conventional <,> vaccine making <,> is is
biotechnology

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#176:1:B>
But I am sure you heard that <,> now <,> you you have better
vaccines <,> which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools
or <O> one word </O> tools <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#177:1:A>
That means biotechnology was already there <,> <{> <[> very
much <,> but genetic engineering provided <,> uh tools which <,,> has hasten
the process of

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#178:1:B>
<[> Very much </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#179:1:B>
<w> That's that's </w> the way I I I would look at
biotechnology today <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#180:1:A>
Prof Das do you think that whatever you are doing <,> or your
group or <,> genetic engineers are doing in India or all over <,> do they
have <,> any relevance to the people or masses <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#181:1:A>
Like your organism for example has <,> uh the direct benefit <,>
in agriculture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#182:1:A>
What are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this
<,,> uh genetic engineering unit <,> or genetic engineering researches <,> or
researches in modern biology

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-046#183:1:B>
There can be many examples <,> and some of these have been
tried abroad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#184:1:B>
I I I will start with an example which I always give <,> and <w>
that's </w> the example of human insulin <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#185:1:B>
You know the uh all diabetics <,> must take insulin <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#186:1:B>
Now insulin <,> is naturally made in the pancreas of animals
including us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#187:1:B>
So <,> when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take
insulin from outside <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#188:1:B>
And that insulin used to come <,> only from animal pancreas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#189:1:B>
So animals would have to be slaughtered <,> and the insulin would
have to be isolated <,> and then processed and we take injection <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#190:1:B>
Uh so <w> that's </w> what they have done is they had projected
the need of insulin <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#191:1:B>
And they have found that they would soon come <,> when you just
would not able to kill as many animals <,> to supply the <,> uh insulin

<ICE-IND:S1B-046#192:1:B>
This is point number one <,> </I>
