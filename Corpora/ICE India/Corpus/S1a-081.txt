<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#1:1:A>
I am uh Professor Prem Singh of the Department of the
Linguistics University of Delhi <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#2:1:B>
I am Ravindra Gargesh <,> also of the Department of Linguistics
University of Delhi <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#3:1:A>
Uh well <,> since <,> uh we were talking about <,,> the
problems <,> uh that we face <,> in analysis of literary text <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#4:1:A>
Uh you see besides <,> you know <,> the text in stylistic analysis
<,> uh what other things you are paying attention to ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#5:1:A>
You see I am also engaged along with that the whole problem of <,>
uh uh translation and <,> uh and in that you see I have told you that <w>
I've </w> <,> been dealing with this problem that <,> all translations are at
the <.> le </.> <,> level of parole <,> not at the level of langue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#6:1:A>
Now how does this fitting include <,> your theory of stylistics and
understanding of a text <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#7:1:B>
Ah <w> that's </w> very interesting <,,> you see <,> uh first
of all what comprises <,> textual analysis <,,> because coming from the <.>
dis </.> discipline of linguistics <,,> we have to be micro approach to begin
with the micro approach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#8:1:B>
Now in the micro approach <,,> we have to see what the text is
constituted of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#9:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#10:1:B>
That is the text is a larger <,> <{> <[> uhm uhm <,> symbol
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#11:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#12:1:B>
But what is that symbol made of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#13:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#14:1:B>
And when we break it into its uh <,> constituent parts <,> <{>
<[> uhm uhm <,> then we have to look at it <,> in terms of its language
structures

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#15:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#16:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#17:1:B>
Language structures in the sense of <,> in linguistic terms
<,> as well as in let us say metalinguistic terms <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#18:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#19:1:B>
In the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the
<,,> uh how the <,> uh particular sensitivities are issues are coded <,> or
certain concepts are coded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#20:1:B>
And then how that codification <,,> does not remain only the prime
way does not contain only primary limits <,> but it is to have secondary
limits <,,> within a larger context <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#21:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#22:1:B>
So we have to look at <,> uh the language at two levels <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#23:1:B>
First level is the level of linguistic structures <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#24:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#25:1:B>
And in second level will be level of lexical significations
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#26:1:B>
Significations within <,,> textual context <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#27:1:A>
So what your significance is not really significant in the
sense of <,> uh the contemporary or French school <,> in the sense that <,> a
particularly there is <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> company where they are
trying to <,> deconstruct <,> the text <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#28:1:A>
You don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any <,> significant
way where either the <,> the entire <?> structuation </?> of signification uh
<,,> falls apart in a way <,> but at the same time it gives you the peep <,>
a peep into human minds

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#29:1:A>
It also believes <,> a kind of psychological and philosophical and
historical forces involved <,> in understanding of a text <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#30:1:B>
Very right <,> very right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#31:1:B>
Uh we are <,> I mean the kind of analysis that I am doing <,> these
are variants between French school different way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#32:1:B>
But that was primarily <,> because I think the text as way odd
identity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#33:1:B>
And uh <,> perhaps I would not like to begin analysis wherever I
want <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#34:1:B>
So that is one defect <,> because for the <,> in the deconstruction
<,> one can bring in anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#35:1:B>
You can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#36:1:B>
Whereas <,,> if text is structured <,> if human mind is structured
<,> or if language is structured <,> then definitely the text must also uh
<,> get restructured <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#37:1:B>
And if the text has a structure <,> we have to go from some recent
structure towards the end <,> or towards significations <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#38:1:A>
Basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a <,>
grammar of <,> of stylistics and grammar of analysis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#39:1:A>
And you know if I quote uh that these <quote> all grammars leak
</quote>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#40:1:A>
So what are the leakages in your <O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#41:1:B>
Yes the grammar is weak and there are <,> major weaks in this
grammar <{> <[> so that </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#42:1:A>
<[> Even </[> </{> even you see <,> though in all linguistic
analysis we know <,> that <,> in Panini grammar which is called the perfect
grammar <,> is is <,> really an imperfect grammar otherwise <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> Katyayana would not need to write <,> uh would not have needed to write
separately <,> and then openly didn't need to get up and defend Panini
against Katyayana

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#43:1:A>
And sometimes uh you know <O> one word </O> makes a <,> uh fun of
himself

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#44:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#45:1:B>
Oh alright <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#46:1:A>
<O> Two words </O> fool of himself when defending <?> Panini
</?>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#47:1:B>
Ahn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#48:1:A>
Uh <,> so <O> one word </O> worried about is <,> what are the
leaks <,,> in your grammar of style and your grammar of literary analysis <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#49:1:B>
Well there are many leaks

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#50:1:A>
Ahn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#51:1:B>
<w> It's </w> leaving of <w> it's </w> leaving everywhere

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#52:1:B>
Because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh
<,> literary analysis that <O> one word </O> you can put it like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#53:1:B>
There is no comprehensive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#54:1:B>
For example <,> for poetry <,> for poetic analysis we require <,> a
separate set of parametres <,,> for analysis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#55:1:B>
For drama <,,> which may be a non-poetic text particularly <,> <w>
we'll </w> require separate uh <,> uhm parametre for analysis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#56:1:B>
And for stories <,> or narratives we would require still separate
parametres of analysis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#57:1:B>
So you see there are multiple levels of analysis

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#58:1:A>
I I <,> <{> <[> and <,> could say <,> to catch that I say one
is the phonological one is the morphological level <,> third is <,> a
syntactic level in that way <,> you can't you want to <,> say that at this
parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#59:1:A>
I say alright <,> poetry is a kind of <O> one word </O> level <,>
phonology and <,> uh a drama at the level of uh <,> morphology and <,> and
text <,> analysis of a <,> a fiction is at the level of syntax

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#60:1:A>
How would you defend <,> uh your position against mine this this
<{> <[> your view </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#61:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#62:1:B>
<[> Yes that </[> </{> would be uh my position will be at
variance <,> somewhat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#63:1:B>
Uh for poetic analysis I would agree with you that uh <,>
phonological patterns are significant <,> morphological pattern are
significant <,> syntactic patterns are significant <,> semantic
configurations will be in the sense of figurative language <,> are
significant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#64:1:B>
And how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger
meaning constructs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#65:1:B>
But in drama <,> things are going to be different <,> because by
and large we may have sentences which are incomplete <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#66:1:B>
So there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would
be line laced or stanzas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#67:1:B>
But in drama <w> we'll </w> have to be very different <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#68:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> have to bring in discourse <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#69:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> have to talk about speech events <,,> and we will
have to analyse language <,> as constituting speech event <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#70:1:B>
And the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events
put together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#71:1:B>
And we will have significations speech <w> that's </w> all about it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#72:1:A>
Well I think there are <,> but I still think uh <,,> that <O>
one word </O> more and more about it <,> that most of this analysis <,,> is
at the <.> le </.> at the level of parole <,> not at the level of langue
because it doesn't go <,> into the soul of literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#73:1:A>
Uh so then I think there needs to be some compromise between old
<,> what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#74:1:A>
There must be now <O> two words </O> now just say <,> <w> it's </W>
a <.> phenolo </.> <w> it's </w> <?> phonologian </?> don't want to touch it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#75:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#76:1:A>
Uh if we do that <,> then your analysis is primarily based on
the theories of Roman Jacobs <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#77:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#78:1:A>
And over <w> Jacob's </w> and <w> Bob's </w> <,> to a most of
the time <,> what you will <,> what modern people will dismiss as
phonological analysis <,> so that Roman <w> Jacob's </w> and <O> one word
</O> pushed in <w> it's </w> nothing <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#79:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#80:1:A>
But <,> uh but phonological analysis <,> so we have one needs
to kind of going to uh <,> certain other aspects and we need to broaden <,>
uh uhm from or your uh uh <,> your theory of style <,> uh then say <,> <w>
you're </w> basically <w> what's </w> <w> you're </w> doing is <,> as a
modifying <?> partial </?> position <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#81:1:B>
Ah yes <,> in a way you can say that for <.> Ra </.> Roman
Jacobsan I would say that his theory was a brilliance with <w> it's </w>
practice <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#82:1:B>
In practice he was a grammarian <,> <O> cough </O> in theory he was
a phonetician <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#83:1:B>
And the two well there was a significant between the two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#84:1:B>
Uh whereas uh uhm for Bob <,> <w> Bob's </w> known known uh
linguistic facts as well

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#85:1:B>
He would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#86:1:A>
<{1> <[1> For the present <O> one word </O> </[1> yes Bob was
not interested in language for say <,> Roman Jacobson was interested
primarily and <,> in a very fundamental way <{2> <[2> Uh uh the uh the </[2>
language <,> <{1> <[1> yes <,> or the <O> one word </O> work uh verbal
shiftance <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,> in Russian

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#87:1:A>
Uh Russian phonology <,> <{3> <[3> yes <,> or French phonology

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#88:1:B>
<[1> Phonographs like uh like </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#89:1:B>
<[2> Yeah uh in a way yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#90:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#91:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#92:1:B>
<[3> Yes </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#93:1:A>
History of <{> <[> French phonology </[> and uh you know and
uh his you know work on Lithuvanian and Latin accent

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#94:1:B>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#95:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#96:1:A>
They all <,> you know basically he was <,> concerned with
language

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#97:1:A>
Even his work on <O> one word </O> is basically how <,> we as a
linguist can handle and help <,> those unfortunate people <,> for this <,> uh
uh speech disorders

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#98:1:B>
Yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the <O> one word
</O> mood

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#99:1:A>
But uh but I think <w> Bob's </w> was not concerned about any
of these things

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#100:1:A>
And needed <,> needed and <O> a few words </O> any of them is
concerned with these issues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#101:1:A>
So <w> they're </w> <,> actually they should be separated in a way
totally <,> as to separate <,> theorotically approaches to our understanding
of literary texts

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#102:1:A>
Am I right <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#103:1:B>
Well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned
surely they are talking different things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#104:1:B>
But when we approach uh <,> a problem theoritically <,> surely we
have a right to sympathise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#105:1:B>
And uh I for one would like to sympathise <w> Simpson's </w> side
<,> rather extend the Jacobsonian model <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#106:1:B>
Because if you see the different analysis that Jacobson has made
<,> of the different texts in French and English and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#107:1:B>
Always what he has done is <,> he has broken down a text books
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#108:1:B>
And that was the <O> one word </O> against him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#109:1:B>
That the elements that Roman Jacobson formed in a <O> two words
</O> could be found in a pattern of a newspaper as well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#110:1:B>
So he has dramatical patterning <,> or he does not <{> <-> wants
</-> <+> want </+> to do the text

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#111:1:A>
I don't think that <,> that the correct position as for as
<,> Roman Jacobson is concerned because <,> Roman Jacobson is very much
concerned about metres <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#112:1:A>
You can't have him <,> that cut a newspaper text and say there is
a <O> one word </O> constructed <,> every year

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#113:1:A>
Say for example his analysis of uh <,> great French poet <O> one
word </O> <,> alright <{> <[> where </[> he talks about metres

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#114:1:A>
Pushkins he talks about metres <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#115:1:A>
You know while <,> no where Bob doesn't mentioned metres <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#116:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#117:1:B>
So while he had <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#118:1:A>
That you also have been uh they have been doing it <,> but
trying to escape <,> metres <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#119:1:B>
No I have not never try to escape metre <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#120:1:B>
In fact I begin with metrical analysis <,> I begin in phonological
analysis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#121:1:B>
That the first level of <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#122:1:A>
The look what I mean is this is <,> that you have not started
<,> <{> <[> yes <,> building a theory <{1> <[1> new theory </[1> of metres

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#123:1:A>
Specifically using the same old metrical <?> Hollan </?> and
metrical structures and trying to apply them <,> in new thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#124:1:A>
This kind of thing was done by <,> Kaiser and Holla in here <{2>
<[2> very interesting </[2> book on <,> you know that they have book on
English metres

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#125:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#126:1:B>
<[1> Yes yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#127:1:B>
<[2> Yes Kaiser and Holla </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#128:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#129:1:A>
Alright <,> so what do we do <,,> probably how do we my my
concern is <,> how to integrate all these things <,> into main theory of
linguistic analysis <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#130:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#131:1:A>
And we must sit down <,> must <,> you know put our minds <,,>
into understanding <,> these problems <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#132:1:B>
I agree with you basically <,> uh but with one difference
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#133:1:B>
Role of ours is <,> uh analyse is given the <,> uh theoritical
perspective of the analysis of narratives

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#134:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#135:1:B>
take for example Chaucer to come back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#136:1:B>
So we can't say that he was not language <O> one word </O> <,> or
he was not <,> uh doing literary kind of analysis <,> he was not taking
literature as <,> part of his <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#137:1:B>
He was taking literature as well

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#138:1:B>
But of course his preoccupations much large <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#139:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#140:1:B>
And uh <,> what I mean to say is that of course there is need
to integrate everything

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#141:1:B>
Integrate <,> more into this stylistic theory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#142:1:B>
What we have done so far is not that sufficient <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#143:1:B>
Metre must be seen afresh from new perspective I do agree with you
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#144:1:B>
And uh <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#145:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> move back to again

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#146:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#147:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> try to understand <,,> uh the relationship of
Saussure with all these people <,> particularly Saussurian type <O> one word
</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#148:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#149:1:A>
And how people have been using them <,> and now and then <,>
sometime literary people without even understanding <,> uh what is meant by
it <,> you know contrast and opposition it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#150:1:A>
What is meant by the Saussure thing that <,> uh all linguistic
analysis <,> is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#151:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#152:1:A>
Alright <,> uh even if we leave out all other

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#153:1:B>
But this is exactly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#154:1:A>
And if really think of that <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> two things
come out of Saussurian <?> analysis </O> very clearly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#155:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#156:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#157:1:A>
One is <,> that <,> people don't understand

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#158:1:A>
That this whole theory is based upon <,> <O> two words </O> theory
of <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#159:1:B>
Ah ha <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#160:1:A>
And other thing that come up <,> very clearly <,> uh all sort
of Sassurian these people are not kind to uh <O> one word </O> I don't
understand <,> that the concept of opposition <,> is basically again Red
Indian and foreigners <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#161:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not Saussure

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#162:1:B>
Would you like to elaborate on that ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#163:1:A>
Ah yes I can

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#164:1:A>
See <,> uh when you <,> when Saussure talks about that X and Y <,>
and G <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> are in opposition

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#165:1:A>
And they are in a net <,> net <O> one word </O> of contrast is
there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#166:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#167:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#168:1:A>
Alright

<ICE-IND:S1A-081#169:1:A>
Then the same kind of thing was being said by <,> pre-Paninian <,>
uh <O> two words </O> authentic

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#170:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#171:1:A>
That sounds are primarily <,> in a system of contrast and
opposition they do not exist by themselves

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-081#172:1:B>
Ah <w> that's </w> wonderful <,> </I>
