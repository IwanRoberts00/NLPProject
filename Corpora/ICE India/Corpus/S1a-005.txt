<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#1:1:A>
Uh <,,> hello Basu <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#2:1:A>
How are you

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#3:1:B>
Uhm <,> hello <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#4:1:B>
Chakraborti how are you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#5:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> fine

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#6:1:A>
Uh you for the last uh <,,> ten to fifteen days <,> for the last ten
fifteen days <,> we are going to have a <,> uh new political <,> uh <,> the
transformation <,,> both in the State and <,,> the Centre

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#7:1:A>
What is your opinion

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#8:1:A>
What you think about it <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#9:1:B>
Actually mm <,,> what I think is uhm <,,> that uh <,> I was
reading a newspaper today <,,> in the morning <,,> and uh <,> I found that uh
<,> some <,,> uh some foreigners commented <,> that <,,> it is <,> uh why the
people of India are crying uh <,,> or crying about the <,,> possibility <,,>
of the <,> future democratic

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#10:1:B>
It is <,> that means it is why they are <,> crying so much about
the <,> about the <,> uh existence of democracy in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#11:1:B>
This is this is their comment and I think that uh <,,> okay if it
happens like that <,> uh and uh <,> this uh formation of government <,> which
<,> because it is a democracy so so many parties are there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#12:1:B>
So <,,> if it is uh <,,> uhm <,,> most of the <,> uh <,> parties
they if they join together I think the country will run <,,> well <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#13:1:A>
<w> Don't </w> you think Basu <,> in your home in Japan in <,>
Israel even in <,> uh Sri Lanka <,> in these countries <,> uh <,> there are
many governments which are formed <,> uh by many parties <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#14:1:A>
Single party <,> uh is ruling the country like India

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#15:1:A>
This type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade <,> and
if that be so <,> if Japan can have a government formed by <.> man </.> by
many parties say three or four parties

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#16:1:A>
Israel has got a government recently and that government <,> is
formed by three parties

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#17:1:A>
France in Europe France <,> France has <,> uh got uh uh so in the
government <.> Fre Fre </.> French government you find that a Communists or
Socialists have have joined <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#18:1:A>
Mitterand has got one <,> uh <.> ca </.> cabinet colleague <,> who
belongs to the radical party or that communist party

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#19:1:A>
Naturally if Mitterand President Mitterand can run his government
for a period of ten years <,> uh why <.> In </.> India cannot have a
government <,> consisting of <,> some <,> uh party uh national party national
party representing the national capital or some progressive elements <,> uh
uh in some some political parties like Congress-I Congress-S <,> or even
Janata Dal <,> with <,> some <,> uh radical members belonging to <,> uh
communist party or socialist party <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#20:1:A>
Why we <.> ca </.> we can have a very beautiful government very
viable government very feasible government in our country

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#21:1:A>
Uh <,> and the government and the <,> and the composition of that
government can be <,> uh say uh some members belong to Congress-I some
members belong to C PI-M some members belong to Janata Dal but all these
elements should be progressive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#22:1:A>
So in that way we can form a government

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#23:1:A>
What is your opinion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#24:1:B>
I as I think <,> uh that uh <,,> the people of India are not
very used to this this kind of situation because uh <,,> in the in the past
they had not uh <,> this kind of <,,> I mean the <,> long past <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#25:1:B>
Only <,> only one party <,,> uh uh ruled the <,> our country <,>
one party <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#26:1:B>
But now it is the something different <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#27:1:B>
It is different means uh <,,> because that is why I I say that <,>
because of we are not used to that <,> because <,> we are traditionally <,,>
and <,,> we think that <,> uh only if there is only one party then <,> uh
this <,> uh our country <,,> will progress and if so many parties come
together <,> uh there is a ideological differences <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#28:1:B>
So naturally there will be clash and uhm <,> our democracy <,>
would wouldn't be able to survive

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#29:1:B>
This is the this is the fear <,> this is the fear

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#30:1:B>
I <w> I'm </w> not very much <,,> uhm <w> I'm </w> not very much
<,,> sure whether <,,> uh this government is going to <,> survive <,> <{> <[>
uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#31:1:B>
But uh <,,> let us see <,,> that is <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#32:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#33:1:A>
Okay Basu <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#34:1:A>
Just think what I what I want to say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#35:1:A>
First of all <,> the people of India <,> of the sixtees <,> or the
seventees <,> were not adequately exposed to <,> the West <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#36:1:A>
One of the reasons of Indian <w> people's </w> exposure to the West
is undoubtedly television <,> and <,> the proximity between Indian people and
the western people <,> uh which has been made through different types of
exchange

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#37:1:A>
Political exchange <,> uh tourist exchange tourist <,> exchange or
scholars exchange of scholars <,> or <.> ex </.> exchange of technocrats

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#38:1:A>
So west is not <,> at present times <,> totally alien to us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#39:1:A>
I think <,> there is a kind of close proximity between the <,> west
and the east <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#40:1:A>
Naturally if the governments in those countries are viable <,>
first of all <,,> if that <.> gover </.> if those governments in Europe and
Japan <,> and in <.> Is </.> Israel even in Sri Lanka <,> if those
governments are viable or can run smoothly <,> uh we also can have a
government of that type

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#41:1:A>
When <,,> the so called national party Congress-I has disintegrated
<,> uh itself into different segments <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#42:1:A>
First of all Congress-I has no power <,> of of what do you think

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#43:1:A>
Do you think that India is <,,> basically has got one culture

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#44:1:A>
Or do you believe that India <,,> has got an unity in diversity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#45:1:A>
Or if you <w> don't </w> believe it <w> don't </w> you think that
this is a concept which has been imposed by the British upon the Indians <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#46:1:A>
India in the ancient past was not together <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#47:1:A>
India in the <,> even in the Muslim period India is not <,> was not
<,> one was not a one country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#48:1:A>
India became one <,> and united during this time of the British <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#49:1:A>
Naturally British united India for the sake of the smooth
administration <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#50:1:A>
Now we are running after the same <,> cultural <,> uh identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#51:1:A>
We are running after that that uh that same cultural identity

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#52:1:A>
I I I <w> don't </w> say that India should be disintegrated

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#53:1:A>
No not that

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#54:1:A>
But cultural <,> uh I mean uh India has got a a heterogeneous
culture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#55:1:A>
Heterogeneous national entity <,> and for the sake of the interest
of all the communities belonging to different cultures <,,> should <,> all
the communities should live together peacefully <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#56:1:A>
I mean it is a mutual interest <,> and Congress-I cannot offer us
at present a <,> a a a cannot <.> ca </.> cannot present us a viable
government with the help of which it can <,> rule the whole of the country
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#57:1:A>
What is your opinion <,> about the cultural entity of <,> our
nation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#58:1:A>
<w> What's </w> your opinion what do you say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#59:1:B>
Uhm now now see Chakraborti <,> it is uh <,,> the proverb goes
like that that uhm <,> <quote> too many cooks spoil the broth </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#60:1:B>
Uh this is a <,> proverb and I think that <,> in <,> the present
situation <,,> uh this <,,> proverb uh <,> can go well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#61:1:B>
But still <,,> uhm though I <w> don't </w> stick to this kind of
proverb <,> because uh <,> yes I do agree with you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#62:1:B>
Sometimes <,,> uhm the people <,,> uh sorry people <,,> of India
<,> they are <,,> they belong to different communities <,> and they have
their separate cultures <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#63:1:B>
Naturally <,,> every nation has as India has a particular culture
Japan has a particular culture British has a particular culture uh America
has got a American people have got their own culture

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#64:1:B>
So <,> there is there is a cultural dissimilarity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#65:1:B>
Yeah yes <,> uh a separate culture means <,> uh within the country
<,> not so vast <,> uh the variations <,> the variety

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#66:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> talking about the variety <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#67:1:B>
Variety in Indian culture is something <,,> uh something which you
<w> don't </w> find in uh the western countries <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#68:1:B>
Uh particularly in European

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#69:1:A>
In what sense do you think that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#70:1:B>
<w> Let's </w> suppose our we are Bengalis <,> and uh <,> some
<,> there are some other states <,> where <,,> some other <,> uh communities
live and there is a there is a cultural difference <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#71:1:A>
<w> Don't </w> you think that it is the religion which can
unite <,> all the people belonging to different cultures <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#72:1:B>
No I <w> don't </w> think that <,> uhm because <,,> religion
is something <,> uhm something which <,> uh should <,,> uhm ennoble <,> the
mind of a person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#73:1:B>
It it it goes like that but <,> you see in our India <,,> religion
is something <,,> which is <,> uh <,,> manipulated in some <,> in order to
gain something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#74:1:B>
You are putting some aspersions on religion <,> or those religious
<.> reli </.> religious leaders <,> who <,> uh uh who try <,> to use their
religion <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#75:1:A>
Actually frankly speaking I <w> don't </w> believe in the <,>
in any kind of religion because <,> religion only <,> means when I say that I
am <,> a Hindu and you are a Muslim or he is a <,> uh Buddhist like that that
<,> separates us us <,> that creates a wall between us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#76:1:A>
Only the <,> religion is uh the humanism <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#77:1:A>
Humanism is our religion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#78:1:A>
Humanity <,,> so <,> uh I think that only this should exist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#79:1:A>
Nothing else <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#80:1:B>
So <,> so you have come to the same point again that India is
a country in which <,> peoples of different cultures <,,> people of uh
divergent <,> states <,> are living together should live together in the
years to come atleast in the <,> thousand years to come <,> for the interest
of all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#81:1:B>
So how can you expect <,> that one particular political party say
Congress-I should rule <,,> or can rule <,> such a big country with vast <,>
uh number of <,,> <.> pa pa </.> I mean with a vast population <,> belonging
to different cultural entities

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#82:1:B>
How can you think

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#83:1:B>
I can't make out this thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#84:1:B>
How can you think a political party like Congress-I should rule <,>
for our country <,> because he is a single cook <,> and you <w> don't </w>
allow other cooks to work together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#85:1:B>
I think if all the cooks are invited <,,> and the taste will be
miscellaneous divergent <,> and as the pople <,> in India are of divergent
qualities <,> divergent traits and characters <,> these dishes <,> which will
be prepared by different cooks <,,> will be palatable to all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#86:1:B>
So you must <,> you too at <,> if I accept your <O> one word </O>
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that <,,> we should have different
cooks in New Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#87:1:B>
<w> What's </w> your opinion <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#88:1:A>
Yes that is uh okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#89:1:A>
That is very right

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#90:1:A>
That <,,> uh in the present situation we <w> don't </w> have any
other alternative <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#91:1:A>
We must have to invite <,> uh so many cooks <,> uh so that uh our
country will <,,> so that our country survives <,> and uh <,> it can prosper
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#92:1:A>
Uh it can prosper <,,> uh otherwise uh our country is <,> uh you
know that it is going through a very <,> uh critical <,> time <,> and uh in
order to survive that we must join our our hands together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#93:1:A>
Otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in
future <,> so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#94:1:B>
What type of difficult situation you anticipate

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#95:1:B>
If this government fails in the months <,> to come say two or two
three months

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#96:1:B>
After two months if this government or or say after three months if
this government fails <,> what type of <,> uh <,> what type of apprehensions
<,,> what type of misgivings <,> you think <,> you anticipate <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#97:1:A>
I think that uh <,> in different parts of India <,,> uh you
know that <,> uh about Punjab and <,> uh Assam <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#98:1:B>
Oh it was also during that uh Punjab problem was very much <,>
uh the living <,> <.> dur </.> even during the time of <,> Mrs Indira Gandhi
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#99:1:B>
Uh Assam problem of Assam <,> was also a very <,> burning problem

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#100:1:B>
Burning one during the time of Mrs Indira Gandhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#101:1:B>
So <,> these problems are new to us <,> almost due due to
mishandling of some political leaders <,> uh these handlings <,> these
problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#102:1:B>
So these problems are not new <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#103:1:B>
These problems are very common to us we are habituated

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#104:1:B>
We are accustomed to these problems <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#105:1:A>
Yes we are accustomed but uh see that if <,> uh uh Punjab was
the first <,> then Assam came <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#106:1:A>
And we know that uh there are uh suppressed <,> uh supressed <,>
anger <,> in uh different parts of India

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#107:1:A>
We know that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#108:1:A>
So that exact due to the <,> uh is the is that due to the lopsided
growth or uneven growth <,> of <,> uh uneven growth of particular regions at
the cost of others <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#109:1:A>
Do you think so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#110:1:B>
I think uh that is very much true that sometimes <,> uh uh
that government <,,> uh <,> just intentionally <,,> they say that Bihar is a
very <,,> uh backward because the people of Bihar are <,> very uh idle <,>
and uh very <,,> uh <,,> they <w> don't </w> work at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#111:1:B>
And so they uhm they uhm they uh <,> this state will not <,>
develop <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#112:1:B>
And if it happens like that <,,> uh in the allocation of money
<,,> if it happens like that then naturally the people of Bihar <,,> is going
to revolt against this type of uh <,,> uh behaviour

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-005#113:1:A>
So you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement
management financial mismanagement of the Central government is one of their
important reasons <,> for <,> uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth
in our country and one region is <,> uh being developed at the cost of other
regions

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#114:1:A>
Naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions <,> uh
like eastern regions

<ICE-IND:S1A-005#115:1:A>
Uh people living in the eastern regions <,> are lagging behind and
they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political
or ethnic crisis or <,,> sometimes <,> in secessionist movements <,> </I>
