<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#1:1:A>
Okay today we are going to do the topic <,> <mention> Cell
Specialisation </mention> that is <,> how cells are specialised to form
tissues <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#2:1:A>
So far we have learnt all about <,> <.> mi </.> uh <,> unicellular
organisms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#3:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#4:1:A>
How a single <,> <}> <-> plant looks </-> <=> plant cell looks </=>
</}> like <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#5:1:A>
How a single animal cell looks like <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#6:1:A>
What all it contains <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#7:1:A>
What are the organisms within a cell <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#8:1:A>
Also now we have to study <,> how many cells <,> are <,> arranged
together <,> or when they are grouped together what do they form <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#9:1:A>
What is the form of cell organization ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#10:1:A>
Please raise your hands <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#11:1:S>
A collection of cells <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#12:1:A>
Forms <,,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#13:1:C>
Tissues

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#14:1:A>
Tissues <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#15:1:A>
So this is what we are going to study <,> a collection of cells <,>
forms a particular tissue <,> and why are the cells organized together to
form the tissues ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#16:1:A>
<w> It's </w> because <,> they have to carry out a specific
function <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#17:1:A>
So far you have seen that one single cell carry carries out all the
activity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#18:1:A>
Now when a group of cells get <,> get together they will carry out
<,> the same activity but at a larger level

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#19:1:A>
At the more quicker rate of doing it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#20:1:A>
One cell and ten cells doing the work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#21:1:A>
It is just like <,> one person doing <,> one work <,> and ten
persons doing the same amount of work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#22:1:A>
Which will get over faster <,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#23:1:C>
<{> <[> Ten persons </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#24:1:A>
<[> Ten persons </[> </{> doing the amount of work

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#25:1:A>
So <,> the specialisation of cell <,> to form a tissue is to carry
out a work and this is mainly found up in <,> higher animals and plants <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#26:1:A>
Now the definition of the tissue is <,> <quote> a group of cells
<,> specialised for a particular function </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#27:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#28:1:A>
A group of cells <,> specialised for a particular function <,> to
perform may be absorption of water <,> in the plants <,> or to perform <,> uh
energy <,> uh energy production <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#29:1:A>
Okay that is work in plants and animals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#30:1:A>
Or like chlorophyll production in plants <,,> or the enzyme
production in animals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#31:1:A>
So for a typical function in the cells are grouped together <,> a
set of cells are known as <,> tissues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#32:1:A>
Today we are going to study about <,,> the types of, plant tissues
as well as animal tissues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#33:1:A>
The plants and animals are totally different <,,> from each other

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#34:1:A>
Both of them are basically living organisms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#35:1:A>
But what is that one <,,> one feature which distinguishes plants
and animals <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#36:1:S>
Plants prepare their own food <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#37:1:A>
And animals do not prepare their own food <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#38:1:S>
They take it from others <,> from the plants

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#39:1:A>
What is it present in the plant cell ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#40:1:S>
Chlorophyll <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#41:1:A>
The presence of <,,> chlorophyll

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#42:1:A>
What is chlorophyll <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#43:1:S>
Green colour <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#44:1:S>
Green colouring matter

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#45:1:A>
Green colouring matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#46:1:A>
What does this green colouring matter do ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#47:1:A>
What ability does it have <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#48:1:A>
Yes ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#49:1:S>
It gives the green colour to plant

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#50:1:A>
No <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#51:1:S>
It is <?> brown </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#52:1:A>
No

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#53:1:A>
Yes uh anybody <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#54:1:S>
It absorbs the heat of the sun

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#55:1:A>
It is the only substance from which the plant which has the
ability to absorb the <w> sun's </w> rays <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#56:1:A>
Do you understand any animals which can absorb the <w> sun's </w>
light and prepare their own energy ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#57:1:C>
No no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#58:1:A>
So the green chlorophyll that is uh <,> the green colouring
matter the green pigment within the cell <,> of a plant <,> has the ability
to absorb out the <,,> <w> sun's </w> rays and convert it uh <,> use it for
the preparation of <,> starch that is the basic food material of plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#59:1:A>
Now what are the plant tissues <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#60:1:A>
Plant tissues are of <,> two types <,> one is <,> <{> <[>
meristematic tissue <,> and the second is permanent tissue </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#61:1:C>
<[> Meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue
</[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#62:1:A>
For example <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#63:1:A>
And the second is ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#64:1:C>
Permanent tissues <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#65:1:A>
Now meristematic tissues are usually found at <,> the tip
where <,> tips of the plants where active growth is taking place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#66:1:A>
Like <,> the tip of the root <,> the tip of the shoot <,> that is
when leaves are being produced <,> or the bud that <,> the bud is going to
give rise to a plant <,> or the lateral graticules which you are going to
give direct to the animal plant cell and leaves etcetra <,> or the auxillary
bud <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#67:1:A>
What does the auxillary bud forms <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#68:1:A>
Uh auxillary bud is the thing which will give rise to leaves
etcetra <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#69:1:A>
Now meristematic tissues <,> are uh those cells which are found at
the tips of actively growing parts of the plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#70:1:A>
These cells are <,> polygonal in shape <,> and it has a centrally
<,> placed large nucleus <,> a very dense cytoplasm <,> and they do not have
any <,,> vacuoles in them

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#71:1:A>
No air pins are present <,> and there are no intercellular spaces
within these meristematic tissues <,> okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#72:1:A>
And these tissues are contrary devices they form in larger size and
give rise to a new set of cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#73:1:A>
And the main function is to form new tissues for the plants <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#74:1:A>
Then you have the second set of plant uh <,> the second set of
tissues sorry <,> and that is the <{> <[> permanent tissues </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#75:1:C>
<[> Permanent tissues </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#76:1:A>
Now in the permanent tissues you have again two types <,,> as

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#77:1:C>
Simple permanent

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#78:1:A>
Simple permanent <,> and

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#79:1:C>
<{> <[> Complex tissues </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#80:1:A>
<[> Complex tissues </[> </{> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#81:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#82:1:A>
The simple permanent tissues are <,> they are not uh <,> very
complex in their structure and also their functions are not very <,> high

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#83:1:A>
That is <,> they do not have to <,,> perform extremly vital
functions for the plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#84:1:A>
Vital means <,> those functions which are vital for the <,> life of
the plant

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#85:1:A>
So the uh <,> to see that the plant keeps alive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#86:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#87:1:A>
These types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital
functions are the permanent permanent tissues

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#88:1:A>
And the simple tissues <,> the simple form of <,> permanent tissues
are the one <,> which form a support adding support for the plant or which
forms the main structure of the stem or the root or the leaves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#89:1:A>
And it provides support mechanical support <,> to the plant and to
some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#90:1:A>
Okay you have learnt about plastid <,> in our previous chapter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#91:1:A>
Then we have learnt Plastid as the starch <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#92:1:A>
One is the <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#93:1:S>
<}> <-> <.> Chlor </.> </-> <+> Chloroplast </+> </}>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#94:1:A>
Please raise your hands <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#95:1:A>
Girls <,,> Durga ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#96:1:S>
Chloroplast

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#97:1:A>
Yes

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#98:1:C>
<{> <[> Chloroplast <,> chrmoplast and <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#99:1:A>
<[> Chloroplast chrmoplast and <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#100:1:A>
Now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#101:1:A>
Chromoplast gives <,> <{> <[> colour <,> colour to the plant other
than these <,> and it use of <?> flower </?> is very important one with
starch present in the <?> flower </?> <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#102:1:S>
<[> Colour </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#103:1:A>
So the simple permanent tissues <,> some of them I mean the
leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch <O> one word
</O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#104:1:A>
The preparing of the <O> one word </O> now suppose if you put
simple permanent tissues in the <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#105:1:A>
There is no simple permanent tissues when the name of five <O> a
few words </O> and these which help out in the preparation of starch

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#106:1:A>
Okay <,> now which are the type of simple permanent tissues we
have to see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#107:1:A>
The first one is <,> parenchyma <,,> the second is <{1> <[1>
collenchyma <,> collenchyma <,> <{2> <[2> and the third <,> and the third is
<{> <[> sclerenchyma </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#108:1:C>
<[1> Collenchyma </[1> </{1>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#109:1:S>
<[2> And the third is </[2> </{2>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#110:1:C>
<[> Sclernchyma </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#111:1:A>
We are learning what is it <,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#112:1:C>
<&> Noise </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#113:1:A>
Okay <,> now <,,> out of these simple permanent tissues <,>
the most simple structure is of a <,> parenchyma cell

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#114:1:A>
These are usually <,> green in colour <,> they are spherical <,,>
root in <,> cell there are lot of intercellular spaces in between them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#115:1:A>
They have a large nucleus <,,> and <,,> many vacuoles <,> around
along the thin cyctoplasm <,> plus the other cell uh <,> cellular orgnelles
are present <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#116:1:A>
And they are filled with a number of <,> plastids <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#117:1:A>
These plastids help in the preparation of <,> food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#118:1:A>
The parenchyma cells that is revived <,> they are circular in
shape <,> loosely spaced <,> having a lot of inter-cellular spaces <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#119:1:A>
The cell walls are thin <,,> and they have a large nucleus which
push to one side by the secondary based vacoule <,> plus <,> the plastids are
present in large number in the case of parenchyma cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#120:1:A>
Plastids are not <-> are </-> present in the leaves and the <,>
cells

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#121:1:A>
And if you have to release the very green in colour in the
presence of the green colour plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#122:1:A>
Then we have <,> a second <,> okay the function of the parenchyma
is preparation of <,> food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#123:1:A>
The second type of cells are the <,> collenchyma cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#124:1:A>
These have got <,> a very definite structure <,,> and <,> they
provide mechanical strength to the whole plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#125:1:A>
There is a <}> <-> <.> charact </.> </-> <,> <=> characteristic
</=> </}> thing about the collenchyma is that <,> they are <,,> a firm
thickening at the corners of the four corners of the cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#126:1:A>
This is <,> one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma
cells that is <,> the cell corners show thickening of a specific substance
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#127:1:A>
The thickening is made up of <,,> cellulose <,,> plus pectine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#128:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#129:1:A>
These are substances which are found <,> uh mainly in plant <,> uh
plant bodies rather than animal cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#130:1:A>
Do you know that the cell wall in <,> in plant is made up of
cellulose which you studied in your lower classes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#131:1:A>
Okay but uh <,> collenchyma cells are made up of <,> uh additional
substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more
tougher than the normal other cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#132:1:A>
Even though parenchyma cells <,> contain cellulose in their cell
walls <,> yet <,,> uh which gives it a definite shape around the <,> around
the structure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#133:1:A>
But uh <,> collenchyma cells are <,,> I told you they provide
mechanical support to the plants <,> and for this sake they have to contain a
certain hard structure in their cell body <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#134:1:A>
And this is made by <,> a combination of cellulose plus pectine
and this is <}> <-> <.> fo </.> </-> <=> found </=> </}> in the presence of
in the form of <,,> cell thickenings at the corners of the cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#135:1:A>
Also then the rest of the structures are there like the vacuole or
<,> nucleus <,> the other chloroplasts and the cytoplasm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#136:1:A>
So remember collenchyma provide mechanical support to the plant
body <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#137:1:A>
They are mostly present in the outer layers of a structure like
<,,> the periphery of the leaf uh <,> of the cross section of the leaf or <,>
the borders of the stem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#138:1:A>
Okay the outer walls of the stem <,> to give that thickness to the
stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of <,> collenchyma cells
and it gives that stiffness to the plant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#139:1:A>
Do you understand <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#140:1:A>
Now the last type of permanent permanent tissues <,> uh sorry
simple permanent tissues <,> is the sclerenchyma cells <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#141:1:A>
These are <,,> single shaped cells <,,> and <,,> as it is growing
or as it is maturing <,> what happens is <,> the central part of the cell <,>
starts moving in cytoplasm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#142:1:A>
And in fact the part gets tougher after sometime <,> and it <,> it
becomes very hard and tough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#143:1:A>
And the collection of sclerenchyma <,> forms uh <,> structure
called as <,> <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#144:1:A>
What do they form <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#145:1:A>
<{> <[> <O> One word </O> </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#146:1:C>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#147:1:A>
Okay this is <,> the <O> one word </O> formed in the
sclerenchyma cells start moving and start moving <,> moving out in the inner
part of the cytoplasm

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#148:1:A>
And what <,,> what is important is that <,,> the sclerenchyma <,>
gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and
uh <,> from the jute plant and the hemp plant okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#149:1:A>
So these fibres which we use for making sack <,> or for making
even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#150:1:A>
All these can be obtained from our sclerenchyma fibres <,> which
on maturing <,> have got certain stone cells or <O> one word </O> <,> and
these stone cells give <,> a toughness to the cell and they end up <,>
becoming the fibres of the plant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#151:1:A>
Thus the sclerenchyma cells are found in large numbers in certain
type of plants like the coconut <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#152:1:A>
The coconut palm <,> then you have your jute uh <,> tree or your
hemp <,> etcetra where fibres are obtained from these plants

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#153:1:A>
I shall tell you about these again we use for variety of uh <,>
provisions like making of rope <,> of choirs <,> or even matresses coir
matresses or then <,> the latest is <,> jute cloth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#154:1:A>
So this completes our <,,> uh one topic that is <,> simple
permanent tissues <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#155:1:A>
These tissues have not <,> uh have not totally lost <,> their
ability to <,> divide

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#156:1:A>
That is if we want <,> we can bunch their form <,> they can still
undergo cellular division and form new set of cells

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#157:1:A>
This is what distinguishes <,,> simple permanent tissues from
complex permanent tissues

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#158:1:A>
They have not totally lost their ability to divide that means <,>
when the cell is formed <,> it grows in size but also it has a necessity <,>
it can also divide and form another set of cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#159:1:A>
What we have learnt is that only meristematic cells are capable of
function cell doesn't it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#160:1:A>
But in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo
<,> uh cell division if the need arises though not always <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#161:1:A>
Then you have <,> a large size <,> of <,> <-> cell </-> plant
cells <,> and that is <,> the complex <,> permanent tissues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#162:1:A>
These are the most important tissues of the plant because they
perform <,> the very vital functions <,> like conducting of water <,> and
conducting of <,> food materials <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#163:1:A>
This cell <,> the complex <,> uh permanent tissue <,> which <,>
conduct water are known as your <,> <{> <[> xylem cells </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#164:1:C>
<[> Xylem cells </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#165:1:A>
And the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food
materials are known as your <,> <{> <[> phloem cells </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#166:1:C>
<[> Phloem cells </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-015#167:1:A>
These are found in the innermost regions of the plant or <,>
of the plant structure like the stem the root or the leaf <,> of the tree <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#168:1:A>
The inner most structure of these <,> is form of these root
structure the Xylem and the phloem <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#169:1:A>
Why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because <,>
the word complex is a very key word <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#170:1:A>
If these cells once they are formed <,> once a particular cell is
formed <,> it loses its ability to divide

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#171:1:A>
It can not divide again and form another xylem cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#172:1:A>
It remains by itself <,,> and it goes on performing its function
and after a period of time <,> when it has finished its <,> uh life <,> life
cycle life period it might die off

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#173:1:A>
Then a new xylem cell might come in its place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#174:1:A>
But this cell on its own will not give rise to a new set of cells
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#175:1:A>
Now both these <,> uh cells that is xylem and phloem <,> are found
in the form of tube <,,> towards the whole <,> length of the stem or the
whole length of the root or the whole length of the leaf <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#176:1:A>
They are perfectly arranged in such a way to form a tubular
structure or tube like structure so that <,> conduction of the material
becomes much easier

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#177:1:A>
But even <,> may be in the form of water based minerals <,> or it
might be <,> food materials in the case of <,> phloem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#178:1:A>
Okay <,> xylem <,> conduct water through out the plant body <,>
and phloem conduct waste food material <,> towards the plant body <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#179:1:A>
Now if you want to see the individual structure of xylem and
phloem <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#180:1:A>
The xylem has got <,,> you have two sets of cells again in the
xylem and they are called as <,,> tracheids and vessels <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#181:1:A>
Okay <,,> so you have xylem tracheae and xylem vessels <,> and
both these are found <,> in association with each other

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#182:1:A>
You will never find only a xylem tracheae or you will never find
only a xylem vessel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#183:1:A>
And in the phloem you have two types of cells <,> you have <,,>
sieve <,> and companion cells <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#184:1:A>
And one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that <,> at
the top walls <,,> okay <,> the top walls are not continous <,> but they have
got fine pores in them to form a mess like structure <,> or matting like
structure in between the two top walls the top wall structure in between two
cell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#185:1:A>
And this fine mess like structure acts as a sieving place <,> for
all the materials food materials that passes along the wall <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#186:1:A>
So only a certain type of food material can pass pass through the
phloem tubes having a definite size <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#187:1:A>
All the larger materials will not pass through the sieve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-015#188:1:A>
The food material can be easily accumulated by the <,> rest uh <,>
the leaf of the plant through the <O> one word </O> of plant <,,> </I>
