Institute of Management, Bangalore.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#3:1>
<bold> P</bold><smallcaps>ARTIES</smallcaps> concerned with
financial reports should take note of the following recent developments in
India:

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#4:1>
1. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( <mention> ICAI
</mention> ) has constituted an Accounting Standards Board to assist its
Council in the preparation of accounting standards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#5:1>
2. <mention> ICAI </mention> has set up the Auditing Standards Board
again to assist in its Council the preparation of auditing standards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#6:1>
3. The Government of India has set up the Securities and Exchange
Board of India ( <mention> SEBI </mention> ) to regulate the functioning of
the stock market and the securities industry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#7:1>
4. There has been an increase in the opportunities available to
investors to channel their funds into equity investments through financial
intermediaries like mutual funds.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#8:1>
5. There has been an increase in the number of stock brokers in the
country in response to the increased volume of trading and investment in
securities during the last few years.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#9:1>
6. There has been an explosion in the number of investment magazines
seeking to provide investors with data on a more timely basis than is done by
the <w> company's </w> annual report.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#10:1>
7. The Companies Act as amended in 1988 provides for the circulation
of abridged financial statements to investors, departing from the time
honoured practice of providing the users of financial statements like
shareholders with complete data as required under the company law.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#11:1>
8. Financial institutions have jointly established a credit rating
agency. Credit Rating and Information Services of India Ltd. as an autonomous
body to publish credit ratings of companies. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#12:1>
<h> <bold> IMPACT OF CHANGES ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF REPORTING </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#13:1>
The current corporate financial reporting scene in the light of
the above developments is analysed below in order to understand the emerging
role of financial reporting, with audited financial statements at the core.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#14:1>
Conventionally, accountants have assumed that audited financial
statements are the sole source of information to the decision-makers who use
financial statements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#15:1>
It is normally presumed that the ordinary investor is <quote> "
native" </quote> , meaning <it> thereby the investor takes the financial
figures presented to him uncritically. </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#16:1>
It is necessary to ponder over the continued relevance of these
assumptions on the part of accountants in the context of the available
evidence: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#17:1>
( a) Investors do not use the financial information directly to
make investment decisions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#18:1>
They have options of engaging specialists like analysts and brokers
to interpret financial information or to assign their investment activity to
specialist financial intermediaries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#19:1>
This is possible in India in the new context with the availability of
a larger number of stock brokers, investment advisers and counsellors and
mutual funds like the ones started by <mention> SBI </mention> Capital
Markets, Unit Trust of India and Canbank Financial Services.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#20:1>
Hence, the assumption that investors are solely responsible for
interpreting financial data seems to be an over-simplified view of the
investment scene. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#21:1>
( b) Investors also have the opportunities of getting more timely
information from financial dailies and investment magazines.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#22:1>
Besides presenting timely and relevant information, these periodicals
also provide a critical evaluation of the accounting and auditing practices
concerning some companies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#23:1>
( c) Information on the direct use of financial statements by
investors is not available in India as no major study has been conducted to
ascertain their reliance on financial statement data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#24:1>
Recently, a survey of investors has been commissioned by some leading
financial institutions in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#25:1>
In the absence of clear evidence to show that investors use
accounting numbers, such as earnings per share, to improve the quality of
reporting, entailing substantial costs to prepares may be of doubtful value.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#26:1>
<h> <bold> REGULATION OF ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING STANDARDS </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#27:1>
The formation of the Accounting Standard Board by <mention> ICAI
</mention> for developing accounting standards is an important development
for several reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#28:1>
<it> Firstly, this is the maiden attempt by any agency in India to
reduce </it> the number of accounting alternatives available to management.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#29:1>
So far, <mention> ICAI </mention> has only reacted sporadically to
financial reporting issues, for example, capitalisation of interest,
treatment of retirement gratuity in financial statements, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#30:1>
<it> Secondly, </it> <mention> ICAI </mention> has made it clear that
it would like to <it> enforce </it> accounting standards on industry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#31:1>
Enforcement of accounting standards is sought to be done by requiring
external auditors of companies to point out deviations from the standards
declared to be mandatory by <mention> ICAI </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#32:1>
The legal position in India is that company management shall present
financial statements that show a <quote> " true and fair view" </quote> of
profit and financial position.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#33:1>
The need for accounting standards which seek to ensure uniformity in
accounting policies followed by various enterprises has to be justified in
the light of the <quote> " true and fair view" </quote> approach under the
Companies Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#34:1>
The <mention> ICAI </mention> has no formal powers of enforcement of
accounting standards on preparers of financial statements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#35:1>
<it> Thirdly, </it> Securities and Exchange Board of India (
<mention> SEBI </mention> ) had declared its intention to develop appropriate
accounting and auditing standards in consultation with <mention> ICAI
</mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#36:1>
<mention> SEBI </mention> is going to be a statutory body ( currently
it is functioning as an agency of the Government ) responsible to Parliament
for its functioning.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#37:1>
Whether SEBI can assign its role in formulating financial reporting
requirements including accounting standards to a non-Governmental <O> <&>
page </&> 935 </O> professional body such as <mention> ICAI </mention> is an
open issue.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#38:1>
Alternatively, <mention> SEBI </mention> may find it attractive to
require ICAI to develop accounting standards and subject the standards to
some scrutiny ( real or nominal as may be required ) before giving legal
sanction to them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#39:1>
The involvement of <mention> SEBI </mention> in setting accounting
standards is also likely to take the accounting standards into the political
arena resulting in technical issues of measurement receiving lower attention.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#40:1>
Economic consequences of accounting standards such as fall in the
rates of capital formation, change in resource allocation, etc. may receive
greater attention at the hands of a statutory body like <mention> SEBI
</mention> compared to the amount of attention paid to such consequences by
<mention> ICAI </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#41:1>
<w> <mention> SEBI's </mention> </w> involvement in setting
auditing standards is also likely to have a major impact on the regulation of
the auditing profession in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#42:1>
At present, the auditing profession in India regulates its affairs
within the limits laid down under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#43:1>
<mention> SEBI </mention> may assume a more active role in exercising
control over the quality, quantity and type of professional services auditors
may render.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#44:1>
These projections are supported by developments in the U.S.A. where
the Securities and Exchange Commission has emerged as a powerful regulator in
the securities business in general and financial reporting in particular.

<h> <bold> SOME COMMENTS ON MANAGEMENT BEHAVIOUR </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#46:1>
The annual report of a company generally contains the following:

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#47:1>
1. Financial statements, i.e., profit and loss account and balance
sheet;

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#48:1>
2. Notes on financial statements;

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#49:1>
3. <w> Auditor's </w> report on financial statements and notes;

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#50:1>
4. <w> Directors' </w> report providing a review of the <w> company's
</w> activities; and

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#51:1>
5. <w> Chairman's </w> statement on the <w> company's </w> prospects.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#52:1>
There has been frequent criticism of the practices followed by
companies in reporting some items in financial statements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#53:1>
The allied criticism has been on the role of auditing in relation to
practices considered unsuitable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#54:1>
It would be inappropriate to comment freely on the practices of
companies in financial reporting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#55:1>
There is no comprehensive code of generally accepted accounting
principles ( <mention> GAAP </mention> ) in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#56:1>
While certain principles like accrual are well established,
exceptions to these principles in practices are not unknown, often ignored by
auditors reporting on the statements-for example, accounting for bonus on
cash basis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#57:1>
More importantly, it would be simplistic to expect a corporate
management to adopt a set of accounting policies considered <it> technically
</it> sound by some users or by some other companies since the objectivies of
corporate management in financial reporting are likely to be different from
the objectives of other parties and, perhaps, righly so.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#58:1>
Hence, there appears to be no end to many of the so called accounting
<quote> " abuses" </quote> one always comes across in corporate reports.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#59:1>
There are situations in which management thinks it has to report
figures differently from what GAAP would require it to do.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#60:1>
If necessary, the management may even opt for a qualified audit
report rather than blindly follow GAAP.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#61:1>
The only issue then would be whether the management explains the
circumstances for a departure from <mention> GAAP </mention> in sufficient
details so that users of financial statements are given the information
necessary to compare financial information of the company with its past and
with other companies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#62:1>
So long as the information is provided by the management and the
auditor, there may not be much point in users complaining of non-uniformity
in financial statements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#63:1>
The point made earlier that faced with a choice between GAAP and
qualified audit report the management would opt for the latter, was proved a
few years ago in the case of the widespread accounting practice of
capitalisation of interest relating to the post-commissioning period.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#64:1>
If a company management had cared for the so called technical
considerations in accounting, it would not have accepted qualified audit
reports.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#65:1>
By choosing to have qualified reports, corporate managers made it
clear that their stakes in a dispute concerning the amount of investment
allowance were too high to be ignored in order to satisfy some accounting
requirements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#66:1>
Such behaviour of the management is to be expected and considered by
accounting policy-makers. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#67:1>
<h> <bold> ROLE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-020#68:1>
<w> Auditors' </w> reports sometimes contain serious
qualifications.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#69:1>
The claim that financial statements give a <quote> " true and fair
view" </quote> subject to the qualifications is contradictory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#70:1>
One approach is to consider whether the qualified report should be
done away with.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#71:1>
Another approach is to prescribe materially standards for items in
the financial statements, which would ensure that once a materiality
threshold is crossed, qualification of the report becomes automatic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-020#72:1>
The Auditing Standards Board of ICAI may study the circumstances
under which audit reports are qualified to gain insight into the causes and
extent of qualified reports. </p> <*> small square</*> </I>
