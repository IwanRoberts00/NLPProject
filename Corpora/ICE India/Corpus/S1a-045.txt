Anywhere because we are now <,> in whose who <,> so that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#13:1:A>
<indig> Haan haan </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#14:1:B>
Uhm actually I was not expecting anything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#15:1:B>
One fine day one letter came <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#16:1:B>
You know Joshi <,,> this our <,,> uh this man <indig> yaar </indig>

Diwakar <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#18:1:B>
He was in B E L no <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#19:1:A>
Oh our Joshi okay I I got <,> got him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#20:1:B>
Okay you got him

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#21:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#22:1:B>
<O> one word </O> Joshi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#23:1:B>
He was that uh <,> there at my house that day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#24:1:B>
I suddenly got that letter from one <,,> editor

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#25:1:A>
<indig> Haan haan </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#26:1:B>
And he told <,,> we have selected you for publishing <,,> uh
<w> who's </w> who <,> in Asia and <{> <[> some so called </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#27:1:A>
<[> But how how come </[> </{> he got your address then <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#28:1:B>
Then I started looking at it

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#29:1:B>
It looked as if it had come through the <,> alumini association of
I A S C

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#30:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#31:1:B>
Because it was uh <,> styled in the same way that is he passed
<,> B E in so and so year from this college and M E also in this college and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#32:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#33:1:B>
Working in so and so Company <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#34:1:A>
So his name also <,> got included into that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#35:1:B>
No he is not from I A S C <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#36:1:B>
Then I checked up with two or three my friends who were in <,> I A
S C

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#37:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#38:1:B>
Their names also had appeared <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#39:1:A>
So this was actually whatever uh <,> thought you you were
proud of yourself that your name is in <w> who's </w> who <,> but you don't
feel all those <w> bugger's </w> names also <O> laughter </O> not included in
that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#40:1:B>
Not so but <,> it <,> the <,> initially pressure was very high

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#41:1:B>
But now it is not so

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#42:1:B>
Whether <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> not that uh <,,> something is
of great achievement

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#43:1:B>
Many people who have done <,,> who had excelled in education also
there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#44:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#45:1:B>
Like that it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#46:1:B>
It is some achievement who has done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#47:1:B>
Man of achievement in Asia or something like that they are probably
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#48:1:A>
No <w> that's </w> what I was surprised because <O> laughter
</O> I don't know what actually you had done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#49:1:A>
Well <,> really you have to enlighten me on that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#50:1:B>
That uh okay you have spoken for me also <,> <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#51:1:A>
Uh well uhm how <,> have you told this thing to your boss then

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#52:1:B>
He don't know <,> <w> it's </w> not worth because <,> the
bosses and other people in the factory

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#53:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#54:1:B>
They <,> really are hell bent upon <,> pulling you down <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#55:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#56:1:B>
In the sense <,> now <,> well I have been for <O> one word
</O> because to avoid those <,,> fellas but uh <,,> they are saying that we
will not complete <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> myself and <O> two words </O> simply
getting troubled

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#57:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#58:1:A>
Why why why they are not allowing you to <,> give enough you
are not allowed to do

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#59:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#60:1:A>
Studies or things like that or <,> collect some data <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#61:1:B>
No the thing is atleast upto this January I need free time to
study and <,> uh prepare for my comprehensive exam

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#62:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#63:1:B>
And these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done <,>
which are most silliest in nature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#64:1:B>
And after getting some twenty years of experience <,> <{> <[> uhm
<,> you really feel <,> that technical knowledge is instead of increasing
getting <,> reducing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#65:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#66:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#67:1:B>
You cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply
because <,> you will be getting in trouble <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#68:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#69:1:B>
Now if you enlighten them <,> they will come to know <,> and
tomorrow they will pull your leg

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#70:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#71:1:A>
But I didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#72:1:B>
Uh well some <,> small things <,,> something to be done like
<,,> uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#73:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#74:1:B>
<w> It's </w> supposed to be done by that fellow

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#75:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#76:1:B>
He simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has
done it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#77:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#78:1:B>
So he will transfer it to me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#79:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#88:1:A>
He only has suggested your name <,> name for this

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#89:1:B>
No chance <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> no chance <,> that fellow he

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#90:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#91:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#92:1:A>
Now <,> he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go
for PhD or <,> something like that something <,> <{> <[> no no <,> nothing
like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#93:1:B>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#94:1:B>
He <{> <[> cannot go </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#95:1:A>
<[> You know that </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#96:1:A>
You know <indig> pucca </indig> sure that he cannot uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#97:1:B>
Yeah <,> he cannot go

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#98:1:A>
Yes <,> okay <,,> so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#99:1:B>
Now tell me something about <,> yourself your achievement and
<,> so on and so forth <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#100:1:A>
Look <,> it is the same thing as you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#101:1:A>
Uh only difference is that <,> uh <w> I've </w> <w> I've </w> not
also achieved anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#102:1:A>
But uh <,,> lack of achievement uh <,> uh doesn't mean that now
<w> I'll </w> <w> who's </w> who <w> I'm </w> still not there

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#103:1:A>
Maybe <w> I'm </w> trying to underachieve something may be <O>
laughter </O> hoping that some day my day also will come in a way

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#104:1:B>
Sure

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#105:1:A>
Right now the <,> <w> it's </w> something uh <,,> doing lot
of hard work and like that some project missions are there <,> and uh <,> <{>
<[> with international company </[> then see what what has happened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#106:1:A>
Working hard

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#107:1:B>
<[> I don't know </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#108:1:B>
Specially today this software companies are <,> having lot of
<,,> work actually

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#109:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#110:1:B>
Recently I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#111:1:A>
You see they are growing growing too fast <,> that is that is
idea so <,,> uh basically you are always under staff <,> <{1> <[1> yeah <,>
when you are working <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#112:1:A>
And <,> uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too
fast so I think <,> one of the <,> major problem in software world over is
that uh <,,> we <,,> <O> one word </O> basically we always underestimate the
work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#113:1:A>
That is the problem known all over the world

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#114:1:A>
Always we underestimate our work by <,> some three hundred percent
<O> laughter </O> <,> <{2> <[2> okay <,> so that is that is our true problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#115:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#116:1:B>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#117:1:B>
And what about this uh <,,> what is called as uh sending
programmers to USA as a cheap labourer

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#118:1:A>
Body surfing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#119:1:B>
Yeah body surfing <w> I've </w> read that in computer
magazine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#120:1:A>
<indig> Haan haan </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#121:1:B>
September issue <,> they have send it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#122:1:B>
That uh <,> simply one fellow with a phone will hire some guys <,>
<{> <[> exactly <,> and send there for one year

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#123:1:A>
<[> Exactly </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#124:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#125:1:B>
He will earn lot of money

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#126:1:A>
<w> That's </w> true

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#127:1:A>
There are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#128:1:B>
Uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#129:1:A>
They tell you which uh <,> this thing but the person who is
going there that is also happy because <,> normally once he goes <,> he just
quits that company and joins another company there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#130:1:B>
But that uh <,> <{> <[> H H one </[> visa or something has
change no

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#131:1:B>
B one visa is change to H one visa something

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#132:1:A>
<[> What has happen </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#133:1:A>
Yeah but still still <,> uh what has happened actually it is
not exactly the <,> cheap labour I will say that is also one portion like <,>
uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that <,> like think
about a situation like uh <,,> would you like to go today <,> as a well
qualified person <,> and go <,> and work in Shimoga <,,> or some place called
Shirshi <,> would you like to work like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#134:1:B>
They will not serve

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#135:1:A>
You won't like <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#136:1:A>
You like to work in indutrial base like Bombay <,> Pune <,>
Bangalore <,> Delhi

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#137:1:B>
No no <,> not definitely with the Bombay Calcutta

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#138:1:A>
Okay prefer anywhere uh place in <w> let's </w> say <,> <{>
<[> Bangalore <,> Pune </[> think like that place you won't like to go a
small place

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#139:1:B>
<[> Bangalore or Pune </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#140:1:A>
That is what exactly happens <,> most of the jobs <,> some of
the jobs are in villages in US <,> and <,> people there don't want to go
there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#141:1:A>
Okay but a person going from US <,> uh going from India to USA he
feels that okay America <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#142:1:B>
America <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#143:1:A>
So he is ready to live anywhere

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#144:1:B>
And and another thing <,> one dollar equal to thirty-five
<indig> rupees </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#145:1:A>
Yeah that is one of the thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#146:1:A>
So <,,> that is basically things which keeps you <w> it's </w> so
and there also <,> when you are in the small place <,> there of saving
potential is more and something

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#147:1:B>
But one <,> one thing I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#148:1:A>
Everybody is happy that that is the idea basically <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#149:1:A>
The person who goes there will be happy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#150:1:A>
The person who sent him will be happy

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#151:1:A>
The company who has hired him happy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#152:1:A>
So everybody is <,> so far so far it has been very well situatiion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#153:1:B>
So it is a goody goody happy happy situation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#154:1:A>
Yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he
was there <,> then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go
to big companies

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#155:1:A>
Maybe when he realise <,> when he has enough money then he will
realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-045#156:1:A>
Then then <,> <w> he'll </w> try to

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#157:1:B>
No but the thing is they want they they <,> they try to move
to better but they never come back to India <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#158:1:A>
No some <{> <[> people are </[> there some people have come
back I know <,> lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have
come back <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#159:1:B>
<[> Because that is </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#160:1:B>
Uh ha which company <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-045#161:1:A>
