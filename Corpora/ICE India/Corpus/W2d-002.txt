<bold> CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE OF INDIA : A CRITIQUE </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#3:1>
Taking a close critical look at the present Indian State, the author
first analyses the main constitutional provisions which justify calling it a
modern constitutional democratic State and then discusses its afflictions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#4:1>
He also analyses several factors that weaken the State before drawing
his conclusion regarding growing policisation of Indian State. </it> </p>
</&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#5:1>
FORMAL, LEGAL and institutional arrangements for the governance of
India have been laid down in great details by the Constitution of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#6:1>
The philosophy and legality underlying the Constitution establishes a
democratic, federal, secular and welfare State in India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#7:1>
Carl J. Friedrich, in his classic <it> Constitutional Government and
Democracy </it> , observes:

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#8:1>
Constitutionalism by dividing power provides a system of effective
restraints upon governmental action.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#9:1>
For studying it, one has to explore the methods and techniques by
which such restraints are established and maintained.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#10:1>
Putting it in another, more familiar, but less exact way, it is a
body of rules ensuring fairplay, thus rendering the government <quote> `
responsible' </quote> <sp> 1 </sp> . </p> CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#11:1>
The constitutional democratic State of India is the best example
of <w> Friedrich's </w> picture of consitutionalism.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#12:1>
The Indian Constitution has provided for complex web of checks and
balances to ensure <quote> ` accountability' </quote> and <quote> `
responsibility' </quote> of every public institution and public functionary.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#13:1>
Parliamentary democratic State ensures accountability of the
political executive and competitive politics and periodical elections, on the
basis of universal adult franchise, are meant to ensure <it> popular </it>
control over the political executive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#14:1>
The political executive is dependent on the verdict of the voters and
it has to abide by the decisions of the independent Supreme Court which is
the <it> Guarantor </it> of the Constitution and the Rule of Law. </p> <O>
<&> page </&> 250 </O> <it> Modern State </it>

<p> R. M. MacIver, in his classic, <it> The Modern State </it> , observes
that <quote> " Representative government distinguishes the modern State from
all other" </quote> . <sp> 2 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#15:1>
The Indian Constitution makers established a <quote> ` modern
State' </quote> by evolving a scheme of representative government at the
Centre, the State and the local levels in a federal country and <w> Maclver's
</w> essential principle, like <w> Friedrich's </w> , is fully contained in
the Indian Constitution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#16:1>
Further, modern Marxist and Liberal Democratic Theories demand a
few new things from the modern States at the close of the Twentieth Century.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#17:1>
The Liberal Theorists evaluate a Constitutional Democratic State on
the basis of the effectiveness of the institutions of the State to protect
and promote <it> individual rights and justice </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#18:1>
The State is a means to an end.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#19:1>
The development of a liberated individual is the goal of all social
institutions, including the State and autonomous civil society is an
essential condition for promotion of individual personality and
potentialities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#20:1>
Edward Shils elaborates on this theme of homogenisation of the
individual and local communities by the power of the Centre which is a threat
to the peripheries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#21:1>
Shils observes: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#22:1>
The growth of national societies, of national and international
intellectual and professional communities, of ethnic communities--all of
these have grown at the cost of local communities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#23:1>
The primacy of kinship, as a criterion on the basis of which
solidarity was formed, has receded.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#24:1>
The attachment to locality has been attenuated by the extension of
attachment to larger territories, to provincial or national territories.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#25:1>
There are even instances where attachment to national territories has
become very ineffectual and attachment to transnational territories and to
humanity beyond kinship, ethnicity and nationality. <sp> 3 </sp> </p> <it>
Limitations </it>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#26:1>
The Constitutional Democratic State of India operates under the
limitations of Part III of the Constitution which provides for Fundamental
Rights for individuals which protect not only the political rights but also
cultural rights of every citizen of India, including the minorities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#27:1>
The Supreme Court of India, as a guardian of the constitutional
democracy, is a watchdog of Fundamental Rights of the Indian citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#28:1>
The concept of individual rights has expanded in the Western Liberal
Democratic theory where good governance depends on deference to Human Rights
of the citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#29:1>
Durga Das Basu observes: <quote> " The ambit of the freedom of
religion guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 has been widened by the judicial
interpretation that what is guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 is the right of
<O> <&> page </&> 251 </O> the <it> individual </it> to practise and
propagate not only matters of faith or belief but also those rituals and
observances which are regarded as integral parts of a religion by the
followers of its doctrine" </quote> . <sp> 4 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#30:1>
Thus, the greatest human right of Indians, in a highly religious
society, which also happens to be the home of all major religions and belief
systems of the world, has been fully guaranteed by the consitutional
democratic State of India and Durga Das Basu observes: <quote> " The
sum-total of the above provisions make our State more secular than even the
United States of Aemrica" </quote> . <sp> 5 </sp> </p> <it> Human Rights as
the Yardstick </it>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#31:1>
Secularism in India is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
for the modern liberal theorists to accept that individual citizen in India
has enough freedom to develop his own potential. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#32:1>
Stephen Macedo in <it> Capitalism, Citizenship and Community
</it> states that <quote> " The authors of <it> Habits of the Heart </it> (
Robert N. Bellah, Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, Ann Swindler, and
Steven M. Tripton) charge that America is losing the institutions that help
to create the kind of person who could sustain a connection to a wider
political community and thus ultimately support the maintenance of free
institutions <+> " </+> </quote> . <sp> 6 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#33:1>
If the home of liberal democracy is castigated for crippling
individual rights, liberal democrats cannot fully accept that the Indian
State protects, preserves and promotes Human Rights.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#34:1>
Stephen <w> Macedo's </w> own position is: <quote> " Liberals who
take Tocqueville seriously should be concerned about <w> people's </w>
connections with larger wholes than sustain their allegiance while supporting
their individuality, their liberty, and their capacity for self-government.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#35:1>
It is not enough to hold out a vision of a selfless social harmony
that is incapable of attracting the energetic support of people as we know
them" </quote> . <sp> 7 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#36:1>
The yardstick of the Western Democratic Liberals is freedom for
the individuals and the nature of the State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#37:1>
Every Democratic and Constitutional State will be scrutinised on the
basis of its Human Rights record and India cannot be an exception to this
rule.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#38:1>
The critique of Indian State by the Indian liberals is on the basis
of the actual practice of the institutions of the State in dealing with the
issues of individual rights and justice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#39:1>
The European Marxist writers, like Ralph Miliband and N.
Poulantzas from 1970s and early 1980s, drew their inspiration from Italian
communist philosopher Gramsci and they have maintained that <quote> <+> "
</+> the capitalist State has ideological apparatuses and administrative
coercive apparatuses to govern for the extraction of surplus value.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#40:1>
Every capitalist State hegemonises on the <O> <&> page </&> 252 </O>
basis of its ideology and the citizens are conditioned to view the capitalist
State a <quote> ` legitimate' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#41:1>
A critique of State emerges only when we concentrate on the issues of
State Hegemony, Legitimacy and the role of the apparatuses of the State"
</quote> <sp> 8 </sp> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#42:1>
The sum and substance of the discussion in the preceding paras is
that the formal, legal and institutional structure of the democratic,
pluralist, federal and welfare Constitutional State of India is a framework
which is based on normative and many ethical principles with emphasis on
legality which takes care of political and social morality.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#43:1>
But the actual practice of the constitutional State of India cannot
be understood without focusing attention on some real processes of politics
which seem to be contrary to the images of the Constitution makers. </p> <it>
Mirrors Reality of Indian Politics </it>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#44:1>
It was the explicit and the implicit premise of the Constitution
makers that universal adult franchise with regular elections will make a
highly apathetic and a political society quite politicised and socially
assertive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#45:1>
Constitutional Democratic State of India has held ten elections to
the Lower House of the Indian Parliament and regular elections for the State
Assemblies and by 73rd Amendment of the Constitution, regular elections for
the local self-governing institutions have been made legally compulsory.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#46:1>
A Democratic State gains in legitimacy where people participate in
governance through regular elections and hold the political executive
accountable and <quote> ` responsible' </quote> to use the concept of
Friedrich and Maclver.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#47:1>
For Marxists, if a State has strong legitimacy, its capacities to
hegemonise its citizens increase and the coercive apparatuses of the State
are not employed in a ruthless manner to deal with <w> people's </w> protests
and struggles.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#48:1>
Similarly the Western Liberal Democrats concede that States with
strong democratic and electoral legitimacy are relatively better in
protecting Human rights than the States which have weak democratic
legitimacy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#49:1>
The democratic legitimacy of the Indian State has been seriously
questioned by the Liberals and the Marxists.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#50:1>
The Liberals in India have maintained that the election process is
completely vitiated and rigged.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#51:1>
The glowing corruption of the electoral process has eroded the
legitimacy of the demoratic and constitutional State of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#52:1>
The Indian political class is manufacturing electoral legitimacy
through completely unfair electoral practices.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#53:1>
The consitutional democratic State of India has lost its moral
foundations because it is based on manipulated and rigged electoral process.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#54:1>
The pillar of democratic and constitutional State of India is <w>
people's </w> vote and this pillar lies in shambles.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#55:1>
If elections have become illegitimate, if Indian democratic, federal
and constitutional State is also illegitimate, the <O> <&> page </&> 253 </O>
philosophy of the Constitution makers has met with its Waterloo because of
the actual practice of Indian electoral process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#56:1>
The Marxists and many socially <quote> ` marginal groups'
</quote> who are at the <quote> ` periphery' </quote> of the society maintain
that the democratic State of India has been derailed because instead of
<quote> ` negotiations' </quote> with the deprived groups on demands, it has
become confrontational State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#57:1>
The Constitution makers laid down the legal framework for <quote> `
accommodation' </quote> of demands of the labouring classES and cultural
minority groups.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#58:1>
It was expected that during the last 47 years this process of
political accommodation will get strengthened.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#59:1>
Unfortunately failure to accommodate has lead to a situation where
politics of coercion as concretised by the bureaucratic and police
apparatuses of the Indian State has emerged more significant than the
politics of accommodation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#60:1>
This trend of suppression of emerging social asseRtions has been
growing and the Indian State had to enact the Terrorist and Disruptive
Activities ( Prevention) Act ( TADA) 0f 1985.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#61:1>
Not only this, the traditional police and paramilitary forces, like
the Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and Armed Police
Force of every State Government has expanded in numbers and their budgetary
allocations have increased astronomicaly.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#62:1>
Further, new forces like the Rapid Action Force and 30 battalions of
the Rashtriya Rifles, a new para-military arm under the Army Command, has
been created in 1994.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#63:1>
The reason for the establishment of new <it> Rashtriya Rifles </it>
is that the army in India is over-stretched in maintaining domestic civil law
and order.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#64:1>
An Army Officer, makes a telling comment on the creation of the
Rashtriya Rifles as follow: <quote> " At present some of our boys on internal
security duties are not even managing one <w> night's </w> rest in a week"
</quote> . <sp> 9 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#65:1>
<it> India is witnessing growing politicisation alongwith
policisation of the society. </it> </p> EXPLANATIONS FOR WEAKENING OF
CONSITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#66:1>
Rajni Kothari, who has combined positions of superstructural
analysis in <mention> <it> Politics in India </it> </mention> <sp> 10</sp>
with philosophical anarchist perspective in <mention> <it> State Against
Democracy: In Search of Human Governance, </it> </mention> <sp> 11</sp> has
explained that the crisis of the constitutional State in India is
post-Nehruvian because the institutions for governance have been
delegitimised and destroyed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#67:1>
If this is the explanation, then institutions for governance should
be reformed and restored back to their strength.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#68:1>
Political executive, bureaucracy, judiciary, Indian federalism and
all democratic institutions have been completely weakened, and in <w>
Kothari's </w> analysis <quote> " restoration of democratic institutions is
the need of the hour <+> " </+> </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#69:1>
In this philosophical-anarchist mould, Rajni Kothari observes that
the <O> <&> page </&> 254 </O> model of Indian economic and political
development has led to the disenfranchisement of the tribals and the cultural
minority groups of India and it has led to peripheralisation of the majority
of the people.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#70:1>
The Indian State has lost its legitimacy because the <quote> `
peripheral' </quote> social groups have not been empowered to use Amartya <w>
Sen's </w> concept of Empowerment.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#71:1>
Amartya Sen has suggested that if India can spend more resources on
education, health and implement land reforms, democratic strength of India
can be restored. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#72:1>
<h> <it> Internal and External Vulnerability </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#73:1>
Marxist critique of the Constitutional Democratic State of India
is based on historical materialism and political economy approach.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#74:1>
Many streams of Marxist critique have emerged during the last 47
years.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#75:1>
First, India has a very <quote> ` skewed' </quote> market and the
absolute majority of the people do not have purchasing power.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#76:1>
This is a serious constraint on the political economy of the Indian
State and unless purchasing power is created by involving the labour classes
in the productive process of India, the Indian State will remain externally
and internally vulnerable.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#77:1>
It is a vulnerable State because it has a very narrow social base
because of the type of capitalist path of development followed by it. <sp>
12</sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#78:1>
India can resolve its multi-dimensional crises if it can tackle
<quote> ` demand constraint' </quote> by deepening and broadening the Indian
market.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#79:1>
The Indian State is in the danger of losing its sovereignty to global
capitalism if it does not address itself to the problems of rural India and
the deprivations of the working classes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#80:1>
Second, a Marxist critique is rooted in the history of State
formation in India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#81:1>
The Democratic and Constitutional State of India has emerged out of a
very powerful anti-colonial Third World nationalism, but it is a State in the
process of formation and it is a weak State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#82:1>
The essence of this State is weaker ideological hegemony, weak
political legitimacy and fragmented and fractionalised State institutions for
governance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#83:1>
This phenomenon needs explanation. <sp> 13</sp> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#84:1>
<h> <it> Weak Ideological Hegemony </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#85:1>
India is a multi-structural society where the India State is
building modern capitalism and modern institutions for governance on the
basis of social relations and values which belong to the past.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#86:1>
The present India is haunted by the legacies of the past, like caste,
community, territoriality and social exclusivity of superior-subordinate
cultural hierarchies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#87:1>
The Indian State does not have ideological hegemony because India is
involved in a <O> <&> page </&> 255 </O> basic struggle to fight against the
hangovers of the traditional identities with the values of egalitarianism,
secularism and democracy of the modern State system.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#88:1>
This social and cultural struggle is fundamental and it has complex
political manifestations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#89:1>
If on the one hand, the modern Indian State is crippled by the
hangovers of the appeals of the historical past, on the other, economic
development of India is based on class-differentials, regional differentials,
rural-urban disparities, rich States and backward States conflicts and the
global pressures of the New World Political and economic Order.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#90:1>
The leader of the New World Order sees India as a <quote> ` market'
</quote> and it demands from the Indian State maintenance of standards of
Western values of governance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#91:1>
This aspect of external dimensions of the Indian State cannot be
ignored because in the present inter-dependent and highly stratified global
power relations, the Indian State will have to respond to subtle and
sometimes open pressures of the aid-giving countries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#92:1>
It is not only the ideological hegemony of the Indian State which is
weak because of the conflicts between the continuing power of the past
historical consciousness and the emerging trends of modernisation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#93:1>
Such a conflict between the inherited loyalites of the past and the
weak rising forces of modernisation leades to weakening of the democratic
legitimacy of the State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#94:1>
The political class has defamed and drailed the electoral process,
and the fractions and fragments of the political class have intensified
caste, and community, region and religious divisions to create a political
constituency for winning elections.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#95:1>
In the process, every poliltical party has become weak and
sectionalised. <sp> 14</sp> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#96:1>
<h> <it> Elections and Sectarianism </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#97:1>
How can Indian political executive and bureaucratic institutions
gain democratic strength when elections have become contest of sectarianism?

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#98:1>
Political leaders have intensified sectarian violent conflicts and it
requires regular intervention and involvement of the para-military forces in
the routine governance of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#99:1>
Facts speak for themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#100:1>
The Indian Lower House of the Parliament was informed on August 25,
1994 that the expenditure on the Border Security Force has been increasing
every successive year since 1991 and it has reached a high level of Rs.
949.13 <indig> crore </indig> of 1993-94.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#101:1>
The annual expenditure on the BSF for 1991-92 was Rs. 719.24 <indig>
crore </indig> and for 1992-93 it was Rs. 80.52 <indig> crore.</indig> <sp>
15</sp> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#102:1>
<h> CONCLUSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-002#103:1>
It may be mentioned that if politics and elections are reformed
along with the reform of bureaucracy and judiciary, governance of India will
be according to the spirit and not to the letter of the Indian Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#104:1>
While reforming the <w> institutions' </w> is a necessary condition
for governance of the <O> <&> page </&> 256 </O> country, it is not a
sufficient condition to deal with the deeper multidimensional crises of the
Constitutional Democratic State of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#105:1>
If politicisation of India is a positive sign of democratisation of
Indian society, the growing policisation is a sign of growing social
discontent in the country.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#106:1>
India is involved in a dialectical process of a conflict between the
positive and the negative as reflected in the democratisation of society as
well as policisation of the country. <sp> 16</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#107:1>
Many post-Marxists, who believe in class politics, and liberal
democrats have drawn our attention to <it> the autonomy of the political
</it> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#108:1>
Without going into the details of the relative autonomy of the
State, it will suffice to say that if sectarianism of politics is continued
unchecked, the State apparatus will become captive for, by and of the
dominant sectarian groups.

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#109:1>
Such a process is at work in India which is reflected in caste <it>
versus </it> caste, community versus community, region <it> versus </it>
region and tribe <it> versus </it> tribe politics. <sp> 17</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-002#110:1>
In such a situation, relative autonomy of the State becomes a
distant dream. </p> <footnote> <sp> 1</sp> Carl J. Friedrich, <it>
