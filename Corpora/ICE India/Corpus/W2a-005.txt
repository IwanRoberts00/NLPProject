<h> <bold> A STUDY OF FEMINIST MOVEMENT IN POST-WAR AMERICA </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#3:1>
Feminist Movement characterises social history of post-war America
in true sense, for, no other single movement influenced American society and
culture as deeply as it seems to have done.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#4:1>
It surfaced in early sixties-unnoticed, unannounced, taking whole
nation by surprise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#5:1>
Women took jobs in increasing number throughout forties and
fifties with a view to acquire middle class status by supplementing family
income <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#6:1>
However, with growing participation in labour force came growing
realisation of heavy discrimination based on sex in matter of job, wage and
promotion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#7:1>
As it was typically a female problem, their continued participation in
Civil Right Movement wouldn't have helped them in successfully overcoming
it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#8:1>
Responding to demands of circumstances, educated middle class women
launched a movement of their own with foundation of National Organization of
Women, in 1960, to secure them social, economic and personal freedom <fnr>
<sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#9:1>
Their movement picked up quick momentum and spread rapidly without any
government encouragement or patronage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#10:1>
As feminist movement progressed, its aims and perceptions changed
distinctly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#11:1>
It acquired aggressive stances by mid sixties demanding day care
centres, women health collectives, repeal of abortion laws and absolute
equality with men in all respects <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#12:1>
Its attitude towards men in general shifted from being that of
strength and sisterhood in sixties to hard edged anger and animosity by late
seventies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#13:1>
<w> NOW's </w> advocacy of selfrespecting partnership with men at
earlier stage gave way to stiff resistence to what they perceived as male
chauvanism.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#14:1>
They not only condemned their treatment as mere sex object but went a
step further in eighties to demand control of their own productive life
through contraception and abortion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#15:1>
Reinterpretation of Bible from feminist point of view became one of
their pet demands <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#16:1>
<h> <bold> THE RESPONSES : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#17:1>
The Feminist movement drew positive response on various fronts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#18:1>
To begin with, Congress passed Civil Right Act in 1964, which
prohibited discrimination based on sex or race.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#19:1>
As a result, the classified advertisements <}> <-> slowy </-> <+>
slowly </+> </}> started dropping the words <quote> ` men wanted' </quote>
and <quote> ` women wanted' </quote> . <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#20:1>
State and Federal laws prohibited various kinds of discriminations
against women.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#21:1>
The equal credit <}> <-> opportinity </-> <+> opportunity </+> </}>
Act banned sex bias in granting of credits.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#22:1>
The Supreme Court, in its historical decision in 1973, upheld the
feminist demand of right of abortion. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#23:1>
On executive front, the Federal Government, initiated Affirmative
Action programs to end sex based discrimination in appointments and
promotions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#24:1>
Supreme Court ruled against Foreign Service Examination on grounds
that it discriminated against women, as a result, the State Department
cancelled the examination in 1989. <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#25:1>
<h> <bold> BACK LASH : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#26:1>
The Feminist movement provoked a back lash particularly in <w> '
80's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#27:1>
Right to life advocates vociferously demanded an <}> <-> antabortion
</-> <+> anti-abortion </+> </}> constitutional amendment.

Government curtailed welfare aid meant to finance abortion. <fnr>
<sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#31:1>
In 1989, Supreme Court reversed the <}> <-> historcal </-> <+>
historical </+> </}> decision of ' 73 and ruled out in favour of state
restrictions on abortions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#32:1>
Similarly, the concept of positive discrimination and Affirmative
Action Programme came to be challenged exceedingly in Supreme Court.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#33:1>
The states like Pensilvania passed laws against abortions. <fnr> <sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#34:1>
<h> <bold> ACHIEVEMENTS : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#35:1>
One of direct and substantial achievements of feminist movement
was in area of employment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#36:1>
The women participation in labour-force, more than doubled up between
1960-90.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#37:1>
In certain age group and in certain jobs, it not only equalled male
number but exceeded it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#38:1>
More important, the women entered in bigger number, the jobs defined
historically as exclusively male such as medicine, engineering, law,
architect, managerial, and administrative occupations. <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp>
</fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#39:1>
The doors of army, police, Firebrigade were thrown open to them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#40:1>
Under Carter administration ( 1976-80) the women were recruited in
every branch of army, and under Bush administration ( 1988-92) they were
actually involved as Fighters in Gulf War in 1992.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#41:1>
In sports, she made history in 1993 by entering what was always
regarded as exclusively male domain-Boxing.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#42:1>
Sandra Day O Conner, became the first women Supreme Court Judge in
1982.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#43:1>
Sally Ride shot to fame as the first woman astronaut in 1983.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#44:1>
Barbara Harris, a black divorcee civil right activist was first woman
to become Bishop in 1989. <fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#45:1>
Feminist movement created growing realisation on part of both
Federal and State administration that it could not sidetrack or be
indifferent to women in implementing Civil Right Policies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#46:1>
In political arena, the women power got acknowledged through the
historical nomination of Geraldine Ferraro by Democratic party for Vice
President in Presidential Election of <w> ' 84. </w> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#47:1>
Feminist movement also helped women psychologically.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#48:1>
Technological advancement, particularly, the rapid computerisation,
<}> <-> depersonilied </-> <+> depersonalised </+> </}> the work, restricting
the scope for human interaction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#49:1>
This resulted into a deep sense of growing loneliness which affected
the individual life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#50:1>
The feminist movement, particularly in <w> 70's </w> became a
powerful instrument to ally - loneliness inducing a sense of belonging.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#51:1>
It helped women free themselves of many of <}> <-> constrainests </->
<+> constraints </+> </}> which worked against them in past in realm of
personal freedom, self-realisation and autonomy. <fnr> <sp> 13 </sp> </fnr>
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#52:1>
<h> <bold> LIMITATIONS AND FAILURES : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#53:1>
The main and primary goal of equality, remains unfulfilled to
great extent so far.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#54:1>
To begin with, ERA is yet to be ratified in case of employment, job
and professions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#55:1>
Men do have a distinct edge over women in matters of wages and
promotions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#56:1>
Men professionals in <}> <-> engneering </-> <+> engineering </+>
</}> , <}> <-> medicne </-> <+> medicine </+> </}> , architect receive about
25-30 percent more than what their female counterpart do and also get -
promotions comparatively quicker. <fnr> <sp> 14 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#57:1>
In journalism schools women outnumber men but so far salaries are
concerned, former make about 40 percent less than later. <fnr> <sp> 15 </sp>
</fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#58:1>
No major Media Company is headed by women, perhaps with sole
exception of Washington Post, but, in this case, Katharin Graham handed it to
one of her sons and not her daughters. <fnr> <sp> 16 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#59:1>
Judith Martin ( Miss Manners) described her job as copy girl in
Washington Post as <quote> " momentus work with terrible hours and featuring
a take home pay of

$ 27.50 a week and the opportunity to get screamed a lot <+> " </+> </quote>
<fnr> <sp> 17 </sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#60:1>
Garmire, one of 21 women in the 1564 member National Academy of
Engineering, was only the second woman to become the President of optical
society of America in 1991 in the 77 years old organization <fnr> <sp> 18
</sp> </fnr> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#61:1>
Though it is true that many jobs were thrown open to women yet over
80 <O> <&> page centered </&> ( 67) </O> percent of female workers were
concentrated in 20 out of 420 occupations listed by Census Bureau. <fnr> <sp>
19 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#62:1>
A proper study and critical evaluation of feminist movement needs
taking into consideration two simultaneous developments - sexual revolution
and a phenomenon of feminisation of poverty - which together with first <}>
<-> ( .e. </-> <+> ( i.e. </+> </}> feminist movement) not only proved highly
detrimental and harmful to women themselves but rocked the very foundation of
American family and culture.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#63:1>
Sexual Revolution had roots in what educated and earning women
perceived as <quote> " male dominated repressive and antierotic culture."
</quote> <fnr> <sp> 20 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#64:1>
Gripped by a strong streak of permissiveness and pervertism, many
Americans lost faith and interest in sanctity of marriage institution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#65:1>
As a result, number of unmarried couples shot to 1.5 million in 1980,
divorce rate climbed up 100 percent between 1960-80, female headed households
doubled up between 1970-90 and those female headed households with children
increased by 7 percent in ' 70s. <fnr> <sp> 21 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#66:1>
This led to a phenomenon of feminisation of poverty.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#67:1>
Most of 11 million children who received assistance in 1980 under
Aids to families with dependent children belonged to female headed
households. <fnr> <sp> 22 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#68:1>
Consider this data which reflects growing negligence of children
caused by disintegration of family.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#69:1>
In 1950s in 70 percent families father worked and mother took care of
children.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#70:1>
In 1980s, this was true about only 15 percent of families.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#71:1>
In 1983, 13 percent children prepared their own meals and this
percentage rose by 23 percent in next ten years.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#72:1>
The juvenile crime rate doubled up between 1960-80 and about 90
percent juvenile offenders came from single parent family. <fnr> <sp> 23
</sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#73:1>
Under combined impact of feminist movement and sexual revolution,
the family institution collapsed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#74:1>
White woman suffered.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#75:1>
Black one suffered more.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#76:1>
In 80, the number of white female headed families rose to 14 percent
but that of black female headed familes rose to 47 percent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#77:1>
One out of every three black children was born to a teenage mother.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#78:1>
55% of all black babies were born out of wedlock but in inner city
Ghetoes the figure often climbed up above 70 percent. <fnr> <sp> 24 </sp>
</fnr> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#79:1>
<h> <bold> CAUSES OF FAILURE OF FEMINIST MOVEMENT : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#80:1>
Feminist movement suffered from lack of uniform support base
among women.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#81:1>
National Federation of <w> women's </w> clubs and League of women
voters took opposite views on basic issues such as Equal Right Amendement,
Right to live etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#82:1>
They usually followed individual pattern in voting unlike black
voters who voted in block.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#83:1>
It was quite evident in voting pattern in Presidential election of
84.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#84:1>
Electoral strategy of Democratic Party to cash in on women power by
roping in a woman candidate dashed to pieces.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#85:1>
In a survey before election, 16 percent women said they would not
vote democratic party because of her whereas 68 percent said her nomination
made no difference.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#86:1>
In fact majority of women voted for Reagan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#87:1>
As the Feminist movement progressed some of the basic but
controversial issues such as right of abortion came to be politicized and
blown out of proportion to such an extent that the human spirit behind it got
totally distorted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#88:1>
Similarly, certain international development such as <}> <-> hyke
</-> <+> hike </+> </}> in oil prices in early seventies adversly affected
the jobs which came to be defined exclusively as <w> women's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#89:1>
More important, as feminist movement progressed it developed a
conflict over the cultural assumption of traditional role of woman as mother
because of transformation of female labour force.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#90:1>
The percentage of married women in employment rose from 15 in 1940 to
80 in 1970 and that of mothers with small children in employment rose from 0
to 50 percent. <fnr> <sp> 25 </sp> </fnr> </p> <O> <&> page centered </&> (

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#91:1>
<h> <bold> THE ROLE OF WOMEN : </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#92:1>
Many social scientists, both male and female, blame women for the
negative stances, feminist movement took there by causing much damage to
American social and cultural fiber.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#93:1>
The main thrust of criticism against the movement is, it brought a
shift in values. <fnr> <sp> 26 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#94:1>
That, they ran after materialism recklessly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#95:1>
They mistook status, money, power as reward in themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#96:1>
The counter culture feminist and radicals denounced a family as
<quote> ` a secret suicide pact' </quote> and an <quote> ` ideological
conditioning devices in any exploitive society' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#97:1>
Betty Fridman, founder of <mention> NOW </mention> , compared
American Home to <quote> ` Comfortable Concentration Camp' </quote> and
appealed women to free <}> <-> theselves </-> <+> themselves </+> </}> from
it. <fnr> <sp> 27 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#98:1>
Some of <+> the </+> virtues advocated by Greer in her celebrated
work, Sex and Destiny, such as chastity, selfcontrol, motherhood, extended
family etc. remained sadly absent from what female activists <}> <->
propataged </-> <+> propagated </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#99:1>
Perhaps, she rightly hinted that American feminists were obssessively
interested in careers for women. <fnr> <sp> 28 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#100:1>
Career for sake of career, equality for sake of equality, freedom
for sake of freedom, proved ultimately not only meaningless but harmful too.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#101:1>
Charles Krauthamer, in Pietygate School for scandle, wrote,
<quote> " Ferraro didn't get to where she is by dint of cause, ideology or
even issue" </quote> . <fnr> <sp> 29 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#102:1>
Perhaps this is also true of later development of feminist movement
to some extent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#103:1>
In the absence of meaningful philosophy, positive ideology, the
feminist movement couldn't sustain itself.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#104:1>
Female activists, in name of right and equality, forgetting their
true identity, blindly imitated worst rather than best of male model, which
according to Anne Taylor Fleming <quote> " bodes ill certainly for women,
probably for men and for all children." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 30 </sp> </fnr>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-005#105:1>
What kind of role feminist movement played in post-war America
shattered by growing crisis, insane violence, abortion, drunken driving,
homosexuality, pervertism, drug abuse, rape and poronography ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#106:1>
According to Max Learner, the Feminist movement which assumed the
shape of liberation movement, failed to solve <w> women's </w> innermost
problems, instead gave them another and larger context and made them
problematic in different way.

<ICE-IND:W2A-005#107:1>
To quote Mary Anna Dolan, the Feminist movement did fail in this
respect and failure of <w> women's </w> movement is failure of women from
within. <fnr> <sp> 31 </sp> </fnr> </p>
