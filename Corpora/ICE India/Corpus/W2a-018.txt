GODFREY W. PIMENTA, Officer-Central Excise, Pfizer Ltd., Bombay.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#3:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> AFTER </smallcaps> </bold> the enactment of
Central Excises and Salt ( Amendment ) Act, 1985, the office of the Collector
of Central Excise has assumed greater importance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#4:1>
Ordinarily, under the Act, the show cause notice has to be issued
within six months from the relevant date.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#5:1>
However, proviso to section 11A ( I) stipulates that a notice can be
issued within five years from the relevant date if, the non-levy, short levy,
or erroneous refund has occurred on account of any of the following
conditions viz., - - <it> ( a) </it> fraud; <it> ( b) </it> collusion <it> (
c) </it> wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts; and <it> ( d) </it>
contraventions of any of the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act,
1944, or rules made thereunder, with an intent to evade payment of duty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#6:1>
The notice which is contemplated under proviso to section 11A ( 1)
is mandatory in nature and condition precedent before any action is to be
taken under the said proviso, for recovery of duties short levied or short
paid, erroneously refunded for breach of any of the conditions laid down
therein, which seeks to invoke the extended period of limitation specifically
devised by the Parliament. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#7:1>
This extraordinary power of invoking the extended period of
limitation of five years under proviso to section 11A(1) now vests in the
Collector of Central Excise by virtue of the Central Excises and Salt (
Amendment ) Act, 1985.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#8:1>
The object of bringing about this amendment is made clear in the
Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Central Excises and Salt (
Amendment ) Bill, 1985, which states that, show cause notice in regard to
duty of excise short levied or short paid, etc. by reason of fraud,
collusion, or any wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts should be
issued and such cases decided by the Collector of Central Excise instead of
Assistant Collector of Central Excise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#9:1>
Now the question of law that arises and which is subject matter of
conflicting decisions of various tribunals and Courts, is that whether the
Collector includes Additional Collector as contemplated in proviso to section
11A ( 1) to the Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#10:1>
But unfortunately, there is no clear cut decision on this vital
point, which has resulted in controversies between the assessees and the
Excise Department. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#11:1>
The word <quote> ` Collector' </quote> is not defined in the Act,
but rule 2 ( <roman> 2 </roman> ) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, defines
the word which means: ( A) in relation to excisable goods other than Salt - -
<*> dotted line</*> ( B) in relation to Salt, the Salt Commissioner; and
includes Additional Collector and any officer specifically authorised under
rule 4 or rule 5 to exercise throughout any State or any specified area
therein all or any of the powers of a Collector under these rules. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#12:1>
The definition of Collector as defined in rule 2 ( <roman> 2
</roman> ) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, was a matter of controversy
between various decisions of tribunals, <it> <foreign> inter alia </foreign>
, </mention> Khatri Biri Works, Beawar v. Collector of Central Excise ;
Jaipur </mention> </it> [ 1983 E.L.T. 645 ( C.E.G.A.T. ) ; <it> <mention>
Sunil Kumar Ghosh v. Collector of Central excise & Customs, West Bengal,
Calcutta </mention> </it> [ 1983 E.L.T. 1964 ( C.E.G.A.T. ) ; and <it>
<mention> S. Kumar and Others v. Collector of Central Excise and others
</mention> </it> ( 1983 E.L.T. 1057 ( C.E.G.A.T. ) ] </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#13:1>
This controversy was laid to rest by the decision of Calcutta
High Court which examined the issue in detail in case of <it> <mention>
Bansal Industrial Gases ( Bihar ) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise
</mention> </it> [ 1988 ( 37 ) E.L.T. 347 ( CAL. ) ] , wherein the Court has
held that the post of Additional Collector of Central Excise is the same and
equivalent to the post of Collector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#14:1>
However, it is to be noted that the decision of Calcutta High
Court referred to above was in the context of sections 33, 35 and 35B of the
Act, which is not the issue at present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#15:1>
There is an equally applicable decision of the Special Bench in
the case of <it> <mention> Mahavir Products v. Collector of Central Excise,
</mention> </it> [ 1989 ( 41 ) E.L.T. 491 ( Tribunal ) ] , wherein the
appellant had raised the preliminary objection on the ground that after the
Amendment Act of 1985, the Collector was not empowered under the Act to have
the proceedings transferred to himself from the Additional Collector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#16:1>
However, while negativating the above contention of the Appellant,
the Tribunal observed as follows:

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#17:1>
<quote> " The objection is not valid for two reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#18:1>
<it> First, </it> what happened on 27. 12. l985 was that by amendment
of sections 11A ( I) and ( 2), Collector became the competent adjudicating
authority in cases in which proviso to section 11 A ( I) ( for extending the
limit of 5 years ) had been invoked.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#19:1>
Since in the present case, the said proviso had been invoked, there
was nothing wrong in transferring the proceedings to the Collector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#20:1>
<it> Secondly, </it> both the Additional Collector and the Collector
had jurisdiction to adjudicate in the matter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#21:1>
Both were proper officers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#22:1>
Both were competent adjudicating authorities under section 33 and
further under rule 2 ( <roman> 2 </roman> ) , <quote> ` Collector' </quote>
by definition, included Additional Collector as well.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#23:1>
The appellants cannot complain of any prejudice or illegality so long
as their case was adjudicated upon by another officer having jurisdiction
after due notice to them and after granting them a fresh personal hearing.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#24:1>
There is no merit in the <w> appellants' </w> point that the
proceedings before the Collector were without jurisdiction" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#25:1>
However, it is respectfully submitted that, the observation of
CEGAT in case of <it> <mention> Mahavir Products </mention> </it> supra is
not correct, because in the statement of Objects and Reasons of the Central
Excises and Salt ( Amendment ) Bill, 1985, it was specifically and
categorically stated that, show cause notice in regard to duty of excise
short levied or short paid, etc. by reason of fraud, collusion, or any wilful
mis-statement or suppression of facts <O> <&> page </&> 941 </O> should be
issued and such cases decided by the Collector of Central Excise instead of
Assistant Collector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#26:1>
In this connection, it is relevant to mention the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of <it> <mention> Rib Tapes ( India) Pvt. Ltd
</mention> and Another <mention> v. Union of India and Others, </mention>
</it> [ 1986 ( 26 ) ELT 193 ( S.C. ) ] herein it was held: <quote> " It is
not in dispute that in order to interpret a particular provision and to infer
intention of the Legislature, the Objects and Reasons stated in the Bill,
when it is presented to the Legislature could be used" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#27:1>
It, therefore, follows that the Collector of Central Excise, who
has been named the only person in the Central Excises and Salt ( Amendment )
Bill, 1985, is the sole authority in whom the power to issue show cause
notice as well as to adjudicate upon the same under proviso to section 11 A (
1) is vested after the amendment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#28:1>
However, it is to be borne in mind that the Central Board of
Excise and Customs, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause ( b) of
section 2 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, and rule 4 of the
Central Excise Rules, I944, has been empowered to appoint such officers as it
deems fit and invest in him such powers as may be specified in the
notification issued in this behalf. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#29:1>
This provision as contained in the Act and rules made thereunder
cannot override the express provision of proviso to section 11 A ( 1).

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#30:1>
The Additional Collector of Central Excise, who is an authority
subordinate to the Collector of Central Excise cannot usurp the jurisdiction
of the Collector for the purpose of proviso to section 11 A ( 1).

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#31:1>
If that was the intention in law, then Parliament would have so
expressed it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#32:1>
However, it is respectfully stated that as per proviso to section 11
A ( 1), the power has been exclusively vested in the hands of the <quote> "
Collector" </quote> and Parliament has not anywhere in the Act defined the
expression <quote> ` Collector' </quote> as including an Additional Collector
or any other officer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#33:1>
In this connection, it would be relevant to mention the decision of
CEGAT in <it> <mention> D.C.W. Limited v. Collector of Central Excise,
Madurai </mention> </it> ( 1988 ( 35) E.L.T. 167 ( Tribunal ) , wherein it
was held: <quote> " The Central Excise Act has been amended by Central
Excises and Salt ( Amendment ) Act, 1985, with effect from 27. 12. 1985 to
the effect that after the amendment, the show cause notice for recovery of
duty falling under the proviso to section 11 A ( 1) shall have to be issued
only by the Collector of Central Excise and also the Collector is required to
determine the amount of duty excess demanded in the said show cause notice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#34:1>
In other words, the <it> Collector alone is given the exclusive
jurisdiction to issue the show cause notice as well as to determine the
amount of duty demanded" </quote> . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#35:1>
There is also a decision of the South Regional Bench of the
Tribunal in <it> <mention> Punalur Paper Mills Ltd v. Collector of Customs,
Cochin </mention> </it> [ 1987 ( 31) ELT 770 ( Tribunal ) ] wherein it was
held that <quote> " the show cause notice for recovery of duty for a period
beyond six months under that section has to be issued by the collector."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#36:1>
Now, another question which arises is that, whether the order
passed pursuant to adjudication by the Additional Collector under proviso to
section 11 A ( 1) after the Amendment Act of 1985 would be <it> non-est </it>
in law and, therefore, void <it> <foreign> ab initio </foreign> . </it> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#37:1>
Since the Collector is mandatorily required under proviso to
section 11 A ( 1) to issue show cause notice as well as to adjudicate upon
the same, it follows, that, if any show cause notice is issued by the
Additional Collector under proviso to section 11 A ( 1), the hearing and
adjudication, and passing of the order upon such adjudication would be a
non-entity in law, i.e., without jurisdiction and would be nullity since
jurisdiction cannot be conferred either by consent or by executive
instructions, if any.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#38:1>
In this connection, it is relevant to mention the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of <it> <mention> Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan
</mention> </it> [ AIR 1954 S.C. 340 ] wherein Justice Venkatramma Ayyar
observed as follows: <quote> " It is a fundamental principle well established
that a decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity and that
its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be
enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in
collateral proceedings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-018#39:1>
A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial or
whether it is in respect of the subject matter of the action, strikes at the
very authority of the Court to pass any decree and such a defect cannot be
cured even by the consent of the parties" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#40:1>
It is a well settled position in law, clinched by catena of
decision of tribunals and courts, that show cause notice invoking extended
period of five years under proviso to section 11 A ( I) has to be issued by
the Collector himself; otherwise, a show cause notice issued by any other
officer other than the Collector would not be legal and proceedings in
pursuance of such notice would be legally untenable as may be seen, <it>
<foreign> inter alia </foreign> </it> in the following decisions: <it>
<mention> Mysore Prefabs and Prefabs India v. Collector of Central Excise
</mention> </it> [ 1987 ( 27) ELT 487 ] ; <mention> Gujarat State Fertilisers
Co. Ltd. and Another v. <it> Union of India and Others </mention> </it> [
1988 ( 34) ELT 4421 ] ; and <it> <mention> H. Guru Instruments ( North India )
Put Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise </mention> </it> [ 1989 ( 40) E.L.T.
180 ( Tribunal ) ] . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-018#41:1>
To sum up, this anomaly in law will be unresolved till the same
is properly interpreted by the Supreme Court or the law as it stands today is
amended by the Parliament. </p> <*> square</*> </I>
