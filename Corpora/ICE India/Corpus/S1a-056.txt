So which topic

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#46:1:C>
So why why not talk something about the social <,> and all <,>
<{> <[> problems or something like that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#47:1:B>
<[> You should have listed some </[> </{> <,> something
socially relevant and most in thing <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#48:1:C>
Eh do you think uh <,> the <,,> funds that they are collecting
for the earthquake is real worth of <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#49:1:C>
When we have a feeling that nobody is using <,> I mean like <,,>
the population is not as much you know <,> <w> it's </w> <O> one word </O>
only there <,> and we are colleting more than uh <,> double funds only

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#50:1:B>
No they are creating a sort of reserve fund

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#51:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not fund <,> and in one month <{> <[> <O> two

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#52:1:C>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#53:1:C>
It is said that the politicians are only eating it up <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#54:1:B>
No it directly goes to charity associations <,> you <.> nee
nee </.> need not be afraid of uh <,> the funds <{> <[> being used
appropriatly </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#55:1:C>
<[> Not afraid I mean </[> </{> as a citzen I think I should

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#56:1:B>
Uhn <w> you've </w> to <.> di </.> directly send it to
government <,> okay government will supply the funds to non-government
organisation

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#57:1:C>
When the people are not existing only what you are doing with
the money

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#58:1:B>
What kind of people are not existing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#59:1:A>
There <{> <[> are people there are <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#60:1:B>
<[> There are so many people <,> uh the poor people </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#61:1:C>
But the funds that we are collecting

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#62:1:B>
Not for the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#63:1:A>
There are many villages

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#64:1:C>
But the funds that we are collecting <,> I don't think so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#65:1:B>
Not for the people that they are existing now <,> <{> <[> uhm
<,> but <w> it's </w> for people who have been crippled and who have been
disabled and who are suffering <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#66:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#67:1:C>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#68:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not for those who are uh fit and they are uh
<,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#69:1:C>
Then <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#70:1:B>
Then what <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#71:1:A>
Then what <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#72:1:B>
So how do you feel of this programme <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#73:1:A>
What programme <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#74:1:C>
M B A <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#75:1:B>
Programme M B A

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#76:1:C>
I think <,> uh M B A should be <,> strictly made for <,> uh
Commerce students and Engineering students <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#77:1:B>
No way <,> no way you cannot <{> <[> offer </[> management in
every field so

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#78:1:C>
<[> Why </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#79:1:A>
There are <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#80:1:C>
No management only <,> I don't think so <w> it's </w> easy for
the Arts students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#81:1:C>
Atleast they should have some programmes for the <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#82:1:B>
<indig> Nei </indig> you have some programmes <,> <{> <[> arts
<,> <indig> nei </indig> you have some programmes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#83:1:A>
<[> Arts </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#84:1:A>
Of course <O> one word </O> problems nothing like that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#85:1:C>
<w> It's </w> not problems I mean like we are not used to <,>
we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#86:1:C>
Many higher students have this problem

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#87:1:A>
I mean <{1> <[1> you people are hard working and </[1> usually
we have seen that Arts students are very lazy I mean like <{2> <[2> merry go
round </[2> type

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#88:1:B>
<[1> And the <O> one word </O> students yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#89:1:B>
<[2> Uhn very lazy </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#90:1:B>
Lazy <{> <[> sort of people <,> they are not used to obstacles
<w> that's </w> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#91:1:A>
<[> They are lazy people and <,> in the school time <,> <O>
one word </O> know that sort of </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#92:1:C>
I think they should have some training for the M B A beginners
<,> especially to the Arts students

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#93:1:B>
Oh <{> <[> you mean to have foundation course for </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#94:1:A>
<[> They should conduct separate classes </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#95:1:C>
Atleast <,> somehing no the basic foundation <,> should be
little bit strong

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#96:1:B>
<w> They'll </w> find that they need a foundation course <{>
<[> to Arts and the science students </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#97:1:A>
<[> What do you need it </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#98:1:A>
I think <w> you'll </w> have <O> one word </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#99:1:C>
No <,> means regularly I mean <,> you know even my doctor says
<,> <w> I'm </w> regularly irregular <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#100:1:B>
You <,> better enroll for M B A <,> this thing evening
programmes that would be better for you <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#101:1:C>
Now I am

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#102:1:B>
Not this problem are like <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#103:1:C>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{> actually <w> I'm </w>
definitely not interested in business

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#104:1:C>
I have something more interested in <,> <{> <[> Psychology <,>
Psychology doing B A psychiatrist <,> and work for the people especially the
mentally retarded <,> the abnormal <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#105:1:A>
<[> Psychology </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#106:1:B>
And why did you opt for M B A <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#107:1:C>
Means it was just <,> for the heck of it I appeared for it
<,> and I got <?> caught </?> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#108:1:B>
Yeah just for <O> one word </O> <,,> you need to mould your
<,> career <{> <[> and you know why </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#109:1:C>
<[> I don't think so </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#110:1:C>
I think it is pure luck

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#111:1:B>
Obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme
that you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#112:1:C>
No

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#113:1:C>
It was <,> actually after my graduation it was <,> of course M B A
was the first entrance exam that was out <,> <{> <[> so you know </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#114:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#115:1:B>
So because of success <,,> just <,> squeeze in it <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#116:1:C>
I don't know <,> I think

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#117:1:A>
Just tried your luck <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#118:1:C>
Pure luck <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#119:1:B>
<w> It's </w> <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#120:1:C>
I know that <w> it's </w> <,> pure luck <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#121:1:B>
So <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#122:1:C>
And I regret entering it

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#123:1:C>
Maybe <w> I'll </w> be very happy doing it <,> later on <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#124:1:A>
I mean <,> you are planning to do <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#125:1:B>
Many people give <{> <[> an excuse </[> of a sort <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#126:1:C>
<[> Continue </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#127:1:C>
<w> It's </w> not excuse <,> <w> it's </w> a reason but <w>
I'm </w> not <,> giving it up you know <w> I'm </w> standing by <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#128:1:B>
Just offering it <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#129:1:C>
No <w> I'm </w> going to do it <,> you know the first time

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#130:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{> sort of

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#132:1:B>
Yeah now you know <,> you have missed so many <O> one word
</O> in past <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#133:1:C>
I know <,,> <w> that's </w> one thing <w> I'll </w> never be

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#134:1:B>
So how do you feel <,> uh <?> aids </?> is research going on
now <,> how do you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#135:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> out of it <,> <w> I've </w> no idea about it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#136:1:B>
Come on <,> you should be aware of it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#137:1:A>
I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#138:1:B>
Everybody should be aware of it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#139:1:A>
Of course aware of it <,> but <w> I'm </w> <,> I mean I don't
know <,> much about it <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#140:1:C>
Hey what would you be after <.> te </.> <,> ten years from
now <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#141:1:B>
Ten years from now I visualise myself as a <,,> more of a

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#142:1:C>
<[> Hey in which field you are </[> </{> going to be in

<$B>

<w> It's </w> not that <,> only when you dream you think of

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#151:1:C>
You can use <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#152:1:A>
But that is impractical <,,>

<$C>

Not practical <,> you every man has to dream it <,> <w> it's
</w> practically proved <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#154:1:A>
Dream is something different than <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#185:1:C>

I'm </w> telling it out <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#191:1:B>
So you need a challenge always <,,> not guarding your <,> <{>
<[> perspective </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#192:1:C>
<[> Something </[> </{> I mean like <,> I have my own set of

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#195:1:C>
Because I don't <,> compromise with it <,> yes I listen to
you yes <,> yes <,> but I do whatever I want to do <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#196:1:B>
Compromise <,> means we should compromise <,> at times <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#197:1:C>
Look if it is <,> affecting somebody else fine <w> I'll </w>
compromise <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#198:1:B>
No you should compromise with yourself

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#199:1:C>
No <w> that's </w> my life <,> yeah <O> one word </O> <w>
it's </w> my life why <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[> force in my business

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#200:1:C>
Live and let live <,,> <w> that's </w> my policy <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#201:1:B>
<[> No way </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#202:1:B>
So others may be <,> <O> a few words </O> then what <w>
you'll </w> do <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#203:1:C>
Well <,> they are elders <,> yeah <,> I I I can't do anything
if <w> it's </w> my mother or my father <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#204:1:B>
So you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#205:1:C>
But <w> I'll </w> try to convince them no <,> <{> <[> I do it
</[> behind them no problem <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#206:1:B>
<[> So you </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#207:1:B>
So how do you react to your friends <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#208:1:C>
Friends

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#209:1:B>
When they suggest something to your <,> own way <{> <[> it
might means </[> compromise

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#210:1:C>
<[> Look <,> yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#211:1:C>
When <w> it's </w> my friends we <,> share a very different
kind of relationship like <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#212:1:C>
We are very frank <,> everybody knows who <,> how <,> and what she
is going to do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#213:1:C>
Like they can literally predict your every move <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#214:1:B>
Frankness doesn't always mean <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#215:1:C>
<w> I'm </w> telling you <{> <[> listen <,> <w> I'm </w> </[>
</{> telling you know <,> <w> I'm </w> not telling you <,> frankness means
frankness means <,> although <w> they're </w> telling what sort of friendship
<w> I'll </w> <,> share with my friends <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#216:1:C>
And everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood
friends

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#217:1:C>
They know what I am <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#218:1:C>
I mean they know I won't listen to anybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#219:1:C>
But still <,> as a <,> good friend they always give me the advice

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#220:1:C>
And if I find it worth <,> and if I can <,> feel that I can take
it <,> I do it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#221:1:B>
<[> Accept whatever </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#222:1:B>
You always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship <,>
always

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#223:1:C>
Like <,> if it <,> if if never imposed no okay <,> <{> <[> if
it </[> is together you are doing something yes <,> <w> I'll </w> co-operate
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#224:1:C>
Whereas I alone have to do it <,> no I don't take <w> anybody's
</w> advice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#225:1:C>
Of course I ask people <,> but the more you ask people the more
advice that people giving <w> it's </w> more complicating for you to decide
it <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#226:1:B>
<[> If it is </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#227:1:B>
So <w> let's </w> switch on to new topics <,> <w> it's </w>
already boring deciding a single particularly <O> one word </O> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#228:1:C>
I think Sumati should be speaking yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#229:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#230:1:A>
<[> What yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#231:1:A>
What man <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#232:1:C>
Sumati is more <{1> <[1> like a <O> one word </O> </[1> <,>
very good listener and usually you know good listeners <,> they won't like
they don't <{2> <[2> know anything </[2> of themselves <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#233:1:B>
<[1> <O> Two words </O> </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#234:1:A>
<[2> Keep quiet </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#235:1:A>
<O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#236:1:A>
<w> It's </w> true

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#237:1:B>
<w> That's </w> specially true about Capricorns <,> so you
<,> <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#238:1:C>
<[> Oh so </[> </{> you are Capricorn

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#239:1:A>
He must <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#240:1:B>
Definitely definitely <w> I'm </w> a Capricorn <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#241:1:C>
Oh come on <,> don't play tricks on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-056#242:1:C>
But you know what they say on Leos <,> because <{> <[> of that
</[> Leos <O> two words </O> the world the world is stable because of the Leo

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#244:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#245:1:A>
Why

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-056#246:1:C>
<w> I'm </w> not bosting <,> okay because <w> I'm </w> a Leo
<w> I'm </w> not bosting <,> </I>
