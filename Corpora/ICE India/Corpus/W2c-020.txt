<h> DETECTING CANCER PAINLESSLY </h> <O> photograph </O>

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#4:1>
<bold> Due to its simplicity, and rapid diagnosis with minimal
discomfort to patients, Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy ( FNAB) is becoming
increasingly popular among both physicians and patients </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#5:1>
A WOMAN came to the Cytology centre for the diagnosis of a lump in
the breast.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#6:1>
Totally distraught, she tearfully related her case history.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#7:1>
Just two months back, she had become a proud mama, having delivered a
healthy little baby girl.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#8:1>
The days following the delivery, were the happiest in her life.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#9:1>
Till one day, when while lactating her baby, she felt a lump in her
breast.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#10:1>
At first she ignored it.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#11:1>
But days and then weeks passed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#12:1>
The lump persisted.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#13:1>
Each time she palpated her breast, she could feel it lying there,
deep within.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#14:1>
She feared the worst, could it be cancer?

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#15:1>
What if she could die?

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#16:1>
What would happen to her precious baby? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#17:1>
The woman became a total wreck, mentally and physically.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#18:1>
Her family worried about her condition, and coerced her to see a
specialist.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#19:1>
His examination confirmed her fears.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#20:1>
There was a lump in her breast.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#21:1>
The specialist advised her to get an aspiration biopsy of the lump to
be done at the earliest.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#22:1>
A Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy ( FNAB) would establish clearly the
condition of the lesion, he said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#23:1>
The woman as directed, came for the FNAB. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#24:1>
The FNAB technique, in brief, involves puncturing of the lump,
with a fine needle attached to a syringe, and aspirating a few drops of the
fluid with cells from the suspected part, to be spread on the slide, stained
and studied under the microscope for establishing a definite pathological
diagnosis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#25:1>
When the biopsy was performed, instead of a few drops, a large
amount of milkish fluid was aspirated and in a fraction of a minute the lump
disappeared.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#26:1>
The patient, overcome with relief, burst into tears.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#27:1>
The lump was formed due to retention of milk in the breast and not
cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#28:1>
She was unable to believe her good luck.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#29:1>
A touch of the needle and all her fears, her agonies had evaporated
into the thin air.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#30:1>
<w> That's </w> the power of the Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (
FNAB). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#31:1>
Cancer of the breast is the second most frequent malignancy
amongst Indian females, the first being cancer of the osterine cervix.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#32:1>
However, a world wide survey puts breast cancer as ranking first
among cases of cancer in women, especially in the USA and the other western
countries.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#33:1>
In the USA, 27 per cent of women suffer from it and one out of every
11 women is expected to fall prey to this disease in her lifetime.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#34:1>
Fortunately, the incidence of breast cancer in Asian countries,
including India is relatively low; though evidence points to a definite
increase of the cases in the past few years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#35:1>
The cases of breast cancer diagnosed by the FNAB for the last eight
to nine years is indicative of this fact.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#36:1>
No doubt, one of the reasons for this increase is an awareness of the
disease amongst women.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#37:1>
A woman who finds any such abnormality in her breast now rushes to
the hospital or to a private specialist for an early diagnosis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#38:1>
Even after accounting for this, there is a sizeable rise in the
number of breast lesions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#39:1>
Aspiration biopsy done on 600 such patients in the last seven years
in the Goa medical college revealed a total number of 160 cancerous cases.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#40:1>
These figures do not support the general study of Goan females as
they cover only a part of the population.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#41:1>
Even so, there is cause for worry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#42:1>
Another worrisome feature is an increase in the number of breast
tumors amongst women below 40, and especially among girls aged between 10 to
15 years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#43:1>
Recently, there was a case of a girl of 10 years with a benign tumor
and also of a woman of 24 years with an advanced stage of breast cancer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#44:1>
It is commonly known that breast cancer occurs usually in women
in their late forties and fifties.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#45:1>
It is also common in women who had children at a later age or who
have no children at all.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#46:1>
It is widely prevalent amongst obese women and those mothers who do
not breast feed their babies.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#47:1>
However, these concepts are changing fast.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#48:1>
The high incidence of breast cancer amongst young women as observed
in the last few years, is a pointer to this fact, despite the fact that a
majority of Goan girls marry and beget children at a young age and a major
portion of them usually breast feed their babies.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#49:1>
In the USA, incidence of cancers in young people is attributed to the
average American diet, which is rich in fats, oily foods, eggs, meat and
tinned foods with chemical preservatives.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#50:1>
Vegetables and fibre foods are poorly represented in their diets.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#51:1>
The major offenders in this respect are the popular fast foods
joints, regularly patronised by the younger set.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#52:1>
Today, however the American public is heeding the warning of
dieticians, this should serve as a grim warning to our youngsters who blindly
ape the west in their food habits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#53:1>
Another important factor to be considered with respect to this
dreaded disease is the role played by heredity.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#54:1>
Cancer of the breast shows a double fold incidence amongst sisters
and daughters of cancer patients. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#55:1>
The early diagnosis of cancer is undoubtedly very important.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#56:1>
A proper examination of the affected portion is a must.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#57:1>
Breast cancer can be detected at two stages.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#58:1>
First, before it is clinically palpable.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#59:1>
Second, after it reveals itself as a lump.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#60:1>
In the first stage, the cancer is so tiny that it may only be
detected during routine check up by a mammography.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#61:1>
It is advisable for women between 30 and 40 and also those above 50
years ( peak ages) to have a routine mammography done every year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#62:1>
Unfortunately, this facility is limited to only a few major hospitals
in the country and therefore not available to a large section of the
population.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#63:1>
In the second stage, that is when the cancer is big enough to be
palpated, there are different ways to detect it.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#64:1>
Usually, the first person to sense its presence is the patient
herself.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#65:1>
It is therefore recommended to all females between 30 and 40 years
and after 50 years to perform a monthly self-examination of the breast.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#66:1>
The next step is a physical examination by a specialist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#67:1>
When the lump is detected in the breast, one should not panic.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#68:1>
Most of the time, the lump is no more than a benign tumor.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#69:1>
On the other hand, this is no excuse for negligence.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#70:1>
The immediate step should be its pathological examination by a biopsy
for final diagnosis and treatment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#71:1>
Till a few years back, the only method for the pathological
diagnosis of the lump in the breast or any other organ was an operation
biopsy where a few portions of the affected tissues were taken surgically for
a histopathological diagnosis.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#72:1>
For this, the patient had to be hospitalised and the operation was
carried out in most cases under general anaesthesia.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#73:1>
Thus the patient had to undergo twice the ordeal of an operation, one
for the diagnosis, the other for the subsequent treatment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#74:1>
The FNAB technique is a relatively new tool in the armoury of
early diagnosis of cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#75:1>
It is today widely used for the diagnosis of not only breast cancers,
but also that of other organs like thyroid lymph-node and many others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#76:1>
With the introduction of the FNAB, the whole biopsy process is
simplified.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#77:1>
It is painless, and patients accept it without facing any discomfort.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#78:1>
It is performed in the consulting room itself, thus eliminating the
need of an operation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#79:1>
It requires no use of any type of local anaesthesia.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#80:1>
Another very important advantage is that it gives immediate relief to
the patients, ( in the case of cysts pouches filled with fluid and not
cancer.)

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#81:1>
The advantage of choosing this method of examination is that the
report of the findings is ready within a few hours, much earlier than
operation biopsies, allowing the surgeon in the case of cancer, to plan the
line of treatment well in advance.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#82:1>
As mentioned earlier, the biopsies performed by puncturing the lump
with a fine needle attached to the syringe render the technique as simple as
an ordinary intramuscular injection.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#83:1>
Aspirating a few drops of the fluid on a slide and study of its
cellular contents under the microscope is the next part of the test.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#84:1>
The entire procedure hardly takes time.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#85:1>
The patient experiences no discomfort and can leave the consulting
room immediately. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#86:1>
Another advantage of obtaining an early report is that, in cases
of cancer, it prepares the patient well in advance of her condition and thus
of undergoing a radical operation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#87:1>
Due to its simplicity, rapid diagnosis, and minimal discomfort to
the patient, the FNAB technique is being increasingly popular amongst both
physicians and patients. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#88:1>
This method was introduced in the Goa Medical College in 1979-
<w> ' 80 </w> with a modest start of 170 aspirations in the year 1980.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#89:1>
It reached a sizeable figure of 450 <}> <-> aspiration </-> <+>
aspirations </+> </}> in the first half of 1988. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#90:1>
The simplicity of the technique is also enhanced by the fact that
it requires no heavy equipment and thus serves as an ideal method of
diagnosis by surgeons in rural areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-020#91:1>
Today FNAB is providing an increasingly popular method of early
diagnosis of breast cancer and by this, assisting both the doctor and the
patient to explore fresh avenues to cope with this dreaded disease.

<ICE-IND:W2C-020#92:1>
The FNAB is here to stay! </p> </I>
