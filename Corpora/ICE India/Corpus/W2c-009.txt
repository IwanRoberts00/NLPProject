<bold> From Our <@AS> Special Representative {#}

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#3:1>
<@PR> NEW DELHI {#}, <@DR> Jan. 6 {#}
- - The Prime Minister has asked the President to return the
controversial Postal Bill to Parliament.

<ICE-IND:W2C-009#4:1>
In a letter making that request to Mr R. Venkataraman today, Mr
V.P. Singh forwarded the opinion of the former Attorney-General that one
of the <}> <-> provision </-> <+> provisions </+> </}> of the Bill was
unconstitutional and seriously interfered with the <w> citizen's </w>
right to privacy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#5:1>
The Bill was approved by Parliament in 1986, the Government of
the day using its majority in both Houses to pass the piece of legislation
despite strong criticism in Parliament and outside it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#6:1>
The then President, Mr Zail Singh, had declined to give his assent
to the Bill which had sought to amend the Indian Post Office Act of 1898.

<ICE-IND:W2C-009#7:1>
He had left it for his successor, and Mr R. Venkataraman had asked the
Government to obtain the opinion of the Attorney-General. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#8:1>
It would now appear that the opinion of the former
Attorney-General, Mr K. Parasaran, was obtained by the Congress(I)
Government but was not submitted to the President.

<ICE-IND:W2C-009#9:1>
The matter had rested there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#10:1>
One of the commitments made by the National Front during its
election campaign was that the Bill would be scrapped. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#11:1>
An official spokesman said that today the Prime Minister wrote to
the President <quote> " suggesting it may be advisable to return the
Indian Post Office ( Amendment) Bill of 1986 to both Houses of Parliament
requesting that they may reconsider the Bill, especially clause 16"

<@PR> BUCHAREST {#}, <@DR> Jan. 6 {#}.
- - The Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, arrived on a
one-day visit to Romania today, the first by a Kremlin leader since a popular
revolt overthrew the Communist Government of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
report <@SR> Reuter {#} and <@SR> AP {#}. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#34:7>
Two weeks after the revolution in which Ceausescu was executed,
Mr Shevardnadze met the new Romanian Foreign Minister, Mr Sergiu Celac, amid
tight security at <w> Bucharest's </w> Otopeni airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#35:7>
Mr Shevardnadze was whisked away by car without speaking to
journalists waiting in the sub-zero temperature at the airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#36:7>
Security was tighter then normal in the capital, now calm after
last <w> month's </w> fighting between revolutionaries and secret police
units loyal to Ceausescu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#37:7>
The visit was expected to bring a promise of much-needed economic
help for the impoverished Romanian people and improve relations, long
strained by <w> Romania's </w> pursuit of policies independent of Moscow.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#38:7>
Army sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops and balconies
of the Intercontinental Hotel where Mr Shevardnadze was expected to attend a
Press conference later in the day together with members of <w> Romania's
</w> ruling National Salvation Front. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#39:7>
In an interview with Bucharest radio yesterday, Mr Shevardnadze
said the Romanian revolution <quote> " has enormous significance for the
interests of Europe and has an echo which can justifiably be considered
universal" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-009#40:7>
One sensitive issue likely to be on the agenda is relations with
Soviet Moldavia, consisting largely of territory annexed from Romania by
