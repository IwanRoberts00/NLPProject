<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#1:1:A>
Archana are you there <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#2:1:B>
Yes I am there

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#3:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#4:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#5:1:A>
How are you <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#6:1:B>
How are your studies going on <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#7:1:A>
They are going on pretty well but I am now reading for the
examinations that are going to come up in <,> April or May <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#8:1:B>
Why <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#9:1:A>
I don't know I have not been studying too much that is why <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#10:1:B>
What has happened Sonali you were a too studious girl I think
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#11:1:A>
Yeah may be because now-a-days I just keep thinking of <,> one
of the ideas I am getting

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#12:1:B>
Thinking of what exactly about getting married <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#13:1:A>
No <,> not marriage <,> marriage is another two to three years
<,> <{> <[> uh before that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#14:1:B>
<[> Uh too long </[> </{> I think Sonali

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#15:1:A>
No because before that I have to sit for my civil services <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#16:1:A>
I have to do I A S

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#17:1:B>
Oh <,> <w> it's </w> really fabulous thing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#18:1:A>
Okay now <,> I won't talk about that much of future right now

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#19:1:A>
I want to talk about may be say <,> November December <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#20:1:B>
About November December <,> I did not get it Sonali <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#21:1:A>
Okay <{> <[> I </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#22:1:B>
<[> Can </[> </{> you explain it <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#23:1:A>
Okay here we go <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#24:1:A>
I have this idea of <,,> conducting one fun-fair at the university
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#25:1:B>
Of conducting a pardon I beg your pardon <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#26:1:A>
A fun-fair <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#27:1:B>
Oh I think <w> it's </w> really a fabulous job <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#28:1:A>
Thank god you appreciate it and you like it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#29:1:B>
I think it will create a history in our department <,> uh not
only in the department but in the university itself <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#30:1:A>
Why <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#31:1:B>
Why because I think no one has uh <,,> conducted this fun-fair
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#32:1:A>
Before <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#33:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#34:1:A>
So that means <w> we'll </w> be the pioneers <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#35:1:B>
Yeah <O> laughs </O> probably so <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#36:1:A>
In fact you are the one who started the Mister English <,> and
Miss English competition also in the department <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#37:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#38:1:A>
Isn't it so ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#39:1:B>
Isn't it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#40:1:A>
Okay so now <,> <w> I'll </w> start up with the fun- fair <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#41:1:A>
The first thing is <,,> what you say <,> should it be done on a
Humanities <,,> department <,> or a Humanities level <,> as a whole or in <.>
Eng </.> English department level <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#42:1:B>
If you ask my idea I think my opinion is that it should be on
the Humanities level <,> so that <,> we can know each other <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#43:1:A>
Yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be <,> coming together

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#44:1:B>
So all the departments can come together we can just enjoy
have fun <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#45:1:A>
Yeah that will be gutsy imagine <,> eleven department one hand
<{> <[> oh <,> on one ground <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#46:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#47:1:B>
I am dreaming about that day <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#48:1:A>
Yeah but the thing is the first problem what I think we may
face is <,> the money <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#49:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#50:1:A>
Because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on
your hands

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#51:1:B>
So I think you have to plan it all <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#52:1:A>
Yeah <,> in fact I I just let me know because I am new around
here so I don't know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#53:1:A>
Is it possible for the department to <,,> dish out some money or
something <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#54:1:B>
Ah yeah <,> <w> it's </w> possible we can talk with Maya <w>
ma'am </w> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#55:1:A>
Yeah we can <,> otherwise we also have a I think <,>
department of social welfare <,> which can give us money

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#56:1:B>
Yeah yeah yeah <,> otherwise we can go for any sponsorship
<,,> Archies Hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#57:1:A>
But what will be the conditions <,> and what are we supposed
to <{> <[> offer them </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#58:1:B>
<[> Nothing conditions </[> </{> I think uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#59:1:A>
Okay like we can always talk about them <,> we can talk to
them if they are not charging going to charge or something very

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#60:1:B>
Okay <w> let's </w> see I will talk with them <,> and let you
know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#61:1:A>
Okay <,> and as for the stalls <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#62:1:A>
You know one of the stall ideas I have is a <,> request stall <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#63:1:B>
Request stall I did not get it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#64:1:A>
I will tell you what a request stall is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#65:1:A>
You are supposed to have a music system on your stall <,> that will
be only system and or <,> that is the only stall where you are supposed to
play <,> play music for the whole of the fun-fair <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#66:1:B>
<{> <[> <.> Ok </.> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#67:1:A>
<[> You </[> </{> can have a <,> may be forty songs on the
list <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#68:1:B>
I think <,> request songs is it ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#69:1:A>
Yeah request song it is and anybody paying you <,> the amount
you play their song for them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#70:1:A>
For them or for their <,> people around or something like <{> <[>
that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#71:1:B>
<[> Okay </[> </{> <,> so we can get money also I think <O>
laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#72:1:A>
Yes you can earn

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#73:1:A>
See the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be
coming together <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#74:1:B>
<{> <[> Okay </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#75:1:A>
<[> Secondly </[> </{> any fun-fair has to end in profit or in
<?> pour </?> income <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#76:1:B>
Yeah I think it <{> <[> is yeah </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#77:1:A>
<[> It is </[> </{> very difficult for a <,> fun-fair to end
up in a loss <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#78:1:B>
Yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#79:1:A>
Yeah monitory part is there but then again <,> some other
stalls <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#80:1:A>
Can you think of some other stall <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#81:1:A>
Can you think of some other stall <,> Archana <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#82:1:B>
I think you better think <O> laughs </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#83:1:A>
May be okay what do you say about an eats <,> you should have
something <{> <[> to </[> eat upon also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#84:1:B>
<[> Eats </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#85:1:B>
Yeah eatables I think <,,> <indig> samosas </indig> will do
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#86:1:A>
<indig> Samosas </indig> yeah <w> that's </w> not a bad idea
then <{> <[> the chips </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#87:1:B>
<[> Because </[> </{> they are <.> chi </.> uh cheap also <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#88:1:A>
Yeah chips can be there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#89:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#90:1:A>
And you can charge the double amount for them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#91:1:B>
I am getting hungry <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#92:1:A>
Same here <O> laughter </O> but <indig> yaar </indig> we have
to talk about it you know

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#93:1:A>
You have to talk about <,> this and tell to the other classmates
also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#94:1:A>
You have to take their <mention> yeses </mention> and <mention>
noes </mention> also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#95:1:B>
I think Sonali <,> you are the right person to take the
initiative <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#96:1:A>
Okay <w> let's </w> see that but uh <,> and the next stall at
but of course about double your money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#97:1:A>
I know <w> it's </w> a sort of gamble in the university campus <{>
<[> but </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#98:1:B>
<[> I think </[> </{> you should explain this thing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#99:1:A>
Yeah but <indig> Diwali </indig> is there <,> come on <indig>
Diwali </indig> is supposed to be a bit of gamble a bit of <indig> paisa
</indig> <,> money here and money there you know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#100:1:B>
So we can have a <indig> chakli </indig> stall also <O>
laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#101:1:A>
You <{> <[> may </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#102:1:B>
<[> Like </[> </{> <indig> Diwali </indig> stall <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#103:1:A>
Yeah we can have it <,> but in fact for double your money it
is always like uhn <,> you can have a car race stall <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#104:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#105:1:A>
That you through the dices and the <{1> <[1> person </[1> who
reaches at next end <,,> the earliest <,> the person <,> earns double the
money <,,> <{2> <[2> so </[2> if at one time you are getting ten people on
your stall <,,> you pay one person twenty bucks and still you have <,,> I
think ninety bucks on your hand <,> or <{> <[> okay <,> eighty bucks on your
hand

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#106:1:B>
<[1> Okay </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#107:1:B>
<[2> Okay </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#108:1:B>
<[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#109:1:B>
<w> It's </w> really a good idea I think <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#110:1:B>
Anything new <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#111:1:A>
The new thing may be <,> we may have a dance floor or
something <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#112:1:B>
Yeah I think rain dance <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#113:1:A>
Yeah rain dance <,> <O> laughter </O> but from where the
water is going to come <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#114:1:B>
We can go outside <,> <w> it's </w> raining <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#115:1:A>
<w> That's </w> not a bad idea at all <,,> but then we can
always have something of uh <,,> you know what they call that lucky draw <,,>
you <{> <[> know </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#116:1:B>
<[> Okay </[> </{> yeah yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#117:1:B>
Again we can have Miss personality Mister personality <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#118:1:A>
Yeah and we have a Miss Rose too <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#119:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#120:1:A>
How come there is no Mister Rose around <,> why is always
there is a Miss Rose you know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#121:1:B>
I think we <,> this time we will conduct a Mister Rose
competition also <O> laughs </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#122:1:A>
Uh Mister Rose competition

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#123:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#124:1:A>
Not a bad idea at all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#125:1:B>
The most handsome boy will get the award <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#126:1:A>
Yeah <,> and the most beautiful girl will get the award <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#127:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#128:1:A>
That is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from
the people <{> <[> around </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#129:1:B>
<[> I wish </[> </{> I could get the award <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#130:1:A>
Ahn <,> that has to be seen <,> there can be many competitors
at that time you know <,> but the thing is we have to let all the department
in the university know about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#131:1:A>
<.> In </.> infact the people <,> outside the department also <,>
may be the colleges or something <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#132:1:B>
Yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper <,> T V media like
the cable <{> <[> news </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#133:1:A>
<[> That </[> </{> is going to be an expensive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#134:1:A>
The thing can be <,> you can have some <,,> what you call the
notices <,> and then <,> just go and <,> just put them up in the colleges <,>
the different departments of the university physics department is there <,>
you don't have any interaction with the people from that department <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#135:1:B>
Yeah yeah yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#136:1:A>
Chemistry department the geography department is also there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#137:1:B>
I think we can make it on the university level also like <,>
all other departments <,> excluding uh including the humanities and also the
science <,> computer this thing we can include all of them <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#138:1:A>
But then that will consume lots of time and after December
<,> please no more <.> active </.> <{> <[> activities only </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#139:1:B>
<[> I know </[> </{> studies are there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#140:1:A>
Studies are there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#141:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#142:1:A>
And after this I will be thanking god like anything if I just
complete this M A with good marks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#143:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#144:1:A>
I hope <,> I really hope

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#145:1:A>
I scored pretty good marks in my first year <,> but I don't know
what is going to happen in second year <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#146:1:B>
You will score <indig> yaar </indig> believe in god <,> work
hard <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#147:1:A>
Hey speaking of this uh <,> M A and what do you plan to do
after M A <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#149:1:A>
God knows are you planning to get married or something <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#150:1:B>
I don't know probably may be <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#151:1:A>
May be of course <,> fifty percent of the class girls will be
<{1> <[1> married by the </[1> time M A completes up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#152:1:A>
Anyway I <,> I have in fact planned about <,> doing I A S now

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#153:1:A>
My parents <{2> <[2> wanted </[2> it <,,> and in fact first I was
thinking of becoming a lecturer only <,> but then something happened and now
<,> I am going to sit for I A S

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#157:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> that is <,> it is a job <,> and it is the
profession I love <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#158:1:A>
I love to teach <,,> but <,> <w> let's </w> see what happen in the
future <,> mean NET and SET are to big hurdles that are standing in the way
<,,> <{1> <[1> in </[1> I A S also <,,> <{2> <[2> similar <O> one word </O>
</[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#159:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#160:1:B>
<[2> But they </[2> </{2> are <}> <-> channel uh </-> <=>
challenged </=> </}> I think you can accept the challenge <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#161:1:A>

<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#178:1:B>
I think now-a-days everyone needs exposure <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#179:1:A>
Everyone <{> <[> needs </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#180:1:B>

Yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#182:1:A>

like when we have a welcome function <,> I was the only girl who danced <O>
two words </O> you know and rest of the girls <,,> okay there were another
two of them who were going to sing or something <,,> but <,> you you ask them
to do a <,> group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come
forward

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#183:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#186:1:B>

<,> friends <,> <.> gi </.> girl friends

<$B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#194:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-062#195:1:A>
In fact it is very <,> sometimes it is very hurting to see them
just sitting there like <,> somebody should go to them and then <,> they
should be told to do something <{> <[> no initiative </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#196:1:B>
<[> I think </[> </{> they need exposure <,> thats the <,>
lack <,> they are lacking it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-062#197:1:A>
Yeah that is why I <,> wish all of them should work atleast
for two months <,> on hand <,> and they should come to see the world properly
<,>
