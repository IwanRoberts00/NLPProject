<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#1:1:A>
We are here to discuss the priorities <,> of the eighth Five
Year Plan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#2:1:A>
The other day the national development council met and approved of
the directional paper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#3:1:A>
Uh which is <,> preceeding the actual meeting of the <,> eighth plan
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#4:1:A>
Uh there used to be approach papers <,> before every plan <,> and as
<,> an economist who also had a sense of humour once quipped <,> about the
fifth plan <w> it's </w> not the <,,> <w> it's </w> not the approach to the
fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#5:1:A>
Emphasisng the similarity <,> that exists <,> in all our plans <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#6:1:A>
Now one wonders whether <w> it'll </w> be different this time

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#7:1:A>
And to discuss such issues <,> <w> we're </w> going to <,> talk
about whether the <,> planning concept is still relevent into these world <,>
and if so <,> in what way <,> is the eighth plan going to be different from
the past plans <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#8:1:A>
We are going to discuss I think <,> the main thrusts <,> of the
eighth five year plan <,> whatever they are and whatever the priority there
may be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#9:1:A>
We are going to <,> reflect on the size and the shape and the
structure <,> of the eighth plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#10:1:A>
And finally I suppose the financing <,> aspect where the resources
are going to come <,> uh to meet the needs of the plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#11:1:A>
And while doing this <,> major issues like budget deficits <,> uh
shortage of resources <,> uh shortage of infrastructure <,> and also the
balance of payments questions <,> all these will come up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#12:1:A>
May I first ask <,> uh uh Dr Nitish Singh Sen Gupta who is with us
<,> other then and he is the Secretary of the Planning Commission <,> uh
other then Dr <,> Syed Hashim Raza <,> who is Advisor in Perspective Planning
in the Planning Commission <,> and Dr <,> uh Arvind Veermani <,> uh who is
Advisor in the Ministry of Finance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#13:1:A>
Uh it so happens that all of us <,> uh are doctors here you know
and <,> as Alexander Pope once quipped <,> <quote> who shall decide when
doctors disagree </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#14:1:A>
However <,> let me ask uh <,> Dr Nitish Sen Gupta <,> whether he
feel that the planning concept is still relevent today <,> and could we think
of the eighth plan as a <,> a matter relevent to todays time and change
circumstances <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#15:1:B>
Well at a time when <,> all over the world <,> there is a
general uh <,> debunking of the concept of planning <,> we feel that <,>
planning is very relevent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#16:1:B>
Although it is another thing that <,> any planning has to build on
<,> the gains reached <,,> earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the
development experience of <?> declinations </?> <,> following different <,>
<w> it's </w> way slightly different routes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#17:1:B>
In our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to <,>
shed off <,> a lot of the past traditions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#18:1:B>
It has to acquire <,> new traditions <,> and new experience
empirical knowledge <,> so as to make it uh <,> so as to acquire a new
meaning <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#19:1:B>
It is relevent <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#20:1:A>
What do you think uh <,> Dr Hashim Raza <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#21:1:C>
Uh the relevence of planning in our country <,,> is <,,> to be
seen <,> in the context of two very <,> important and major areas <,,> uh
where we need <,> to keep on the developmental phase <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#22:1:C>
One is the area of human development <,> human resources <,> which
includes <,,> the development of <,> taking care of the health <,> by and
large <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#23:1:C>
Uh taking care of the education <,> building up training <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#24:1:C>
Uh along with the provision of certain <,,> uh items of <,> minimum
needs <,> fulfilling the <,> basic <,> essential needs of the people in
general <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#25:1:C>
Now this is <,> what <,,> public sector will have to take care of
<,> particularly in a situation where <,> large gaps still exist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#26:1:C>
In the need for the <,,> services <,> these items public goods and
<,,> uh the provision which already exist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#27:1:C>
Another important area <,> where <,> I think planning will <-> be
</-> remain relevent <,,> in our country for quite a long time is <,> the
building up of infrastructure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#28:1:C>
This include <,> energy <,,> it includes transport infrastructure
communication <,,> uh and <,> it also <,> includes <,> infrastructure like
you know certain essential <O> one word </O> variations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#29:1:C>
Uh therefore in both of these two <,> though in the later part <,>
uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector
wherever possible

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#30:1:C>
For example in energy <,> private sector has been invited to take
part

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#31:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#32:1:C>
But <w> it's </w> <}> <-> <.> par </.> </-> <,> <=>
participation </=> </}> <,> in the coming next few years <,> will only be at
the margin <,> for private sector has to learn how to come in <,> <w> we've
</w> to learn <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#33:1:A>
But hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#34:1:A>
Uh I would like to ask Dr Veermani <,> an in-view of this new
trends towards privatization <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#35:1:A>
Uh an in-view of the fact that <,> uh the new policies of the
government in this country too <,> uh are talking of deregulations and
decontrol and handing things over <,> considerbly to the private sector

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#36:1:A>
Is there still some need for economic planning <,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#37:1:D>
Uh yes certainly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#38:1:D>
Uh and I would like to <,> add one more area <,> uh which has been
<,> uh not mention by Dr Hashim <,> and that is the area of micro-management
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#39:1:D>
In some sense <,> uh even countries which don't have <,> uh
planning in the sense that we have used this word <,> uh still have to plan
their micro-economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#40:1:D>
And that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all
these other three <,> uh have passed the way <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#41:1:A>
Then now let us come to the aspect on this and I would like to
ask Dr Sen Gupta <,> uh in what way <,> is the eighth five year plan
different from <,> uh the past plan ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#42:1:A>
Are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan <,> and
can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#43:1:B>
Eighth plan <,,> uh Prof Khushroo <,> is different from the
previous plans in quite a number of ways <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#44:1:B>
As I said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience
gained earlier <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#45:1:B>
We are starting against the backdrop of <,> very significant growth
rate of five point five percent <,> throughout the decade of the nineteen
eightees <,> and five point six percent during the seventh plan period

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#46:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#47:1:B>
Now so this <,> <}> <-> on the </-> <=> at the </=> </}> same
time because of our inprovidence in the recent past <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#48:1:B>
<w> We've </w> been subject to the need for this kind of rather <,>
uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#49:1:B>
<}> <-> Which is </-> <=> which makes </=> </}> our task somewhat
difficult

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#50:1:B>
Now this plan will seek to <,> <}> <-> <.> ma </.> </-> <=> make
</=> <-> <.> ta </.> </-> <=> take </=> </}> the maximum gain out of the
investment already made <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#51:1:B>
It will be a plan for consolidation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#52:1:B>
It is time we give up the <,> uh earlier race about <,> necessarily
making a plan bigger than the <}> <-> <.> pa pre </.> </-> <=> previous </=>
</}> one in terms of allocation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#53:1:B>
It is time we give up accepting <,> let us say five hundreds
schemes when <w> you've </w> got resources to complete <,> uh only about
hundred schemes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#54:1:B>
It is time to <,> uh give all attention to completing project some
time

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#55:1:B>
So as to avoid <,> time over run and cost over run <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#56:1:B>
Again it is also time to give up this earlier <,> uh uhm you know
misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a
lot of attention to running industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#57:1:B>
Now government has given up <,> uh vacated a large number of areas
in industry hoping that private initiative will take over <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#58:1:B>
Then secondly uh <,,> let us say things like literacy <,> and
population control <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#59:1:B>
Now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population
control

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#60:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#61:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#62:1:B>
Now <,> it is now understood that <,> if only if the <,> all
the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture <,> if
only we have been able to control our population <,> growth to the <,> rate
achieved by let us say China <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#63:1:B>
I think how much that <?> el </?> how much difference that alone
would have made in part of the terms <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#64:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#65:1:B>
Then secondly so today government will concentrate on
infra-structure as Prof Hashim mentioned mainly <,> transport <,>
communication <,> agriculture <,> irrigation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#66:1:B>
Not so much on industry now except certain <,> basic and heavy
industry whose area also has been drastically reduced <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#67:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#68:1:B>
Then we neglected social development very much <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#69:1:B>
We give up a <,> any attempt to achieve literacy <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#70:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#71:1:B>
Now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy
and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#72:1:B>
And then vocationalizing scondary education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#73:1:B>
It will not give <,> enough of direct governmental <,> uh attention
<,> <{> <[> uhm <,> to higher education etcetera etcetera <,> except to the
extent necessary for <,> upgrading <,> the requirement <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#74:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#75:1:B>
And there <,> a lot will depend on <,> uh utilizing private
initiative to supplement government efforts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#76:1:B>
So many <?> respectable </?> governments role will be the role of
<,> a facilitator for desirable activities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#77:1:B>
And doing <}> <-> <.> tha </.> </-> <=> taking </=> </}> direct
action <,> only in the infra-structure <,> and only in social human
development <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#78:1:A>
So it appears that uh <,> though there are important areas
which planning will address uh <,> even now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#79:1:A>
Uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of
the economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#80:1:A>
The private sector also would have something to do with it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#81:1:A>
Uh Dr Hashim do you <}> <-> <.> fe </.> </- > <=> feel </=> </}>
that there are innovations in this plan other than what Dr Sen Gupta has
mention

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#82:1:C>
Uh Prof Khushroo I will <,> suppliment what <,> Dr Nitish Sen
Gupta has said <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#83:1:C>
By emphasising one aspect <,,> of <,,> approach to this plan <,,>
in contrast with the <,> earlier plan <,> is that <,> this plan <,> very
prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of
things

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#84:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#85:1:C>
Which earlier was thought to be achieved just by <,> an outlet
<,> by financial expenditure

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#86:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#87:1:C>
It is very explicitly recognized in this <,> document <,> that
it is not <,> the financial expenditure that can achieve <,> everything

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#88:1:C>
In fact in course of time <,> expenditure has <,> diminishing
return <,> in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#89:1:A>
Ah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#90:1:C>
And therefore <,> involvement of people <,> which brings you
to the development of <,> rural institutions <,> <{> <[> ah <,> the proper
institutions <,> uh a phrase which was <,> used in the second five year plan
<,> I think <,> is becoming much more relevent now <,> developing
institutions adequate to the needs of the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#91:1:C>
And that will be one of the very important <,> I feel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#92:1:C>
This plan <,> this plan for the first time talks of indicative
planning

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#93:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#94:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#95:1:C>
Infact in India we had <,,> a <}> <-> <.> mix </.> </-> <=>
mixture </=> </}> of indicative planning as well as <,> direct planing <,> of
investment and targets in <,> certain areas of public sector <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#96:1:C>
Uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector
of agriculture <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#97:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#98:1:C>
Where the production <,,> is done by millions of farmers <,>
and yet <,> when the sixth food grain target <,> when we decided that we have
to become <,> self-sufficient in food-grain <,> production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#99:1:C>
We took a number of steps <,,> indirect steps by way of creating
infra-structure <,> by <}> <-> way <,> way of </-> <=> way of </=> </}> a
package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#100:1:C>
And to which we were able to achieve <,,> agricultural target <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#101:1:C>
Now we will be paying a little more attention <,,> to the
instrument and the methods of <,,> indicative planning and <,> in large area
widen the area of indicative planning <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#102:1:C>
So this will be another <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#103:1:A>
Now uh <,> I notice that <,> we have had a series of plan in
this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#104:1:A>
Every plan <,> has had a huge budget deficit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#105:1:A>
Uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and
borrowing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#106:1:A>
And therefore borrowing from abroad <,> and particularly borrowing
from the <mention> Reserve Bank of India </mention> <,> has been the order of
the day <,> that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the
economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#107:1:A>
And the story of Indian planning generally is a story of inflation
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#108:1:A>
It also is a story of balance of payment deficit <,> partly for
the same reason <,> that the domestic economy has been inflated <,> and
exports were not released from the domestic economy <,> considerably <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#109:1:A>
Uh Dr Veermani <,> uh would you say that there are some <,> new
things that there is some new thinking <,> or some innovations <,> in the <,>
in the area of budget deficit management <,> and in the area of balance of
payments management in this plan <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#110:1:D>
Yeah let me uh <,> uh just give couple of examples where I
think of genuine effort <,> has been made <,> uh to take account of the
resource constraint <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#111:1:D>
As the popular expression is to <,> cut your coat to <,> to fit
the cloth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#112:1:D>
Uh <,> one uh <,> both things have been mentioned by secretary of
planning <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#113:1:D>
Uh one is the area of social expenditure where <,> uh the focus is
on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money <,> uh
too far and wide and not achieving <,> uh specially <}> <-> <.> ta </.> </->
<=> targets </=> </}> like literacy population control and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#114:1:D>
And second is in the area of infra-structure <,> where if one may
put it a little strongly uh <,> earlier government may have had a kind of <,>
uh dog and the manger attitude <,> that uh <,> they said that everything had
to be done by the government <,> and if the gap could not be closed it was
postponed indefinately <,> sometimes for decades <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#115:1:D>
Uh the attitude now is <,> that if we can not do it <,> uh let us
uh have the private sector do it

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#116:1:D>
So that the goals are achieved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#117:1:D>
Uh so this is basically <,> is a reflection <,> for this attempt
<,> uh to take account of this resource constraints <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#118:1:D>
Uh I would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense <,>
uh because there are still assumptions <,> uh in the plan <,> that public
savings <,> uh the adverse <}> <-> <.> tre </.> </-> <=> trends </=> </}>
which have marked <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> short decade <,> would
in a sense be reversed <,> and the public saving performance would be
improved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#119:1:D>
I think that is critical <,> uh to the plan and perhaps <,> later
on we can discuss <,> in what ways that may be achieved <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#120:1:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#121:1:A>
Now <,> I would like to <,> come to <,> the area of the main
thrust of the <,> eighth five year plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#122:1:A>
What are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority
sectors <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#123:1:A>
What are the areas of achievements which are being uh <,> regarded
as uh thrust areas <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#124:1:A>
If you were to order priorities what would be the list of these
your priorities <,> Dr Sen Gupta <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#125:1:B>
I will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be
<,> in terms of one two three and four

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#126:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#127:1:B>
Now <,> agriculture for instance the idea is to carry <,> the
<mention> Green Revolution </mention> <,> from the North of India <,> where
it has been very much uh manifest <,> to those areas parts of the country
where it has not <}> <-> reach </-> <+> reached </+> </}> before <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#128:1:B>
And secondly to use agriculture <,> to build up exportable surplus
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#129:1:B>
The plan assumes that Indian agriculture has tremendous capacity
and <,> elasticity <,> about uh <,> to create providing a surplus which can
be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#130:1:B>
And also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#131:1:B>
Then population <,> <w> I've </w> already elaborated on the
importance

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#132:1:B>
But the idea is that the <?> crude </?> birth rate <,> should be
brought down from <,> thirty point four per thousand <,> till to about twenty
point uh <,> six by the end of the <,> uh seventh five year plan

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#133:1:B>
And the growth rate of population will automatically come down
from <,> uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point
eight percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#134:1:B>
We still have to go to achieve the rate which China has achieved

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#135:1:B>
And you can see what how China has progressed in terms of economic
development <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#136:1:B>
Then poverty alleviation in general <,> especially by
concentrating on <,> the rural areas and on the urban <}> <-> property </->
<,> <=> poverty </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#137:1:B>
And then employment <,> the plan promises to create ten million
jobs a year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#138:1:B>
And hoping that uh <,> by that by the end of the century with all
the problems of <,> all the problems of education all that <w> we'll </w> be
able to <,,> largely solve the <,> unemployment problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#139:1:B>
Then literacy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#140:1:B>
Literacy because that is very important and we propose to <,> uh
achieve full literacy by the end of this century <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#141:1:B>
By concentrative attention <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#142:1:B>
Then coming to infra-structure well <,,> roads have to be given
importance <,> communication has to be given importance <,> and irrigation
has to be given importance <,> and energy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#143:1:B>
But irrigation again <,> there is a kind of idea to switch on from
<,> the earlier exessive concentration on big project <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#144:1:B>
Recovering a <.> lo </.> involving a long <?> gestation </?> uh
period <,> and a lot of resources on to medium <,> and smaller size <,>
irrigation projects which can be applied very <,> sort of operative <,>
implimentated <,> march more quickly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#145:1:B>
So uh <,> and then uh of course <.> irri </.> uh energy of course
is very important because if we cannot uh <,> have <,> proper electricity of
the <O> one word </O> proper mix of hydel and thermal <,> practically all
development will come to a stop <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#146:1:B>
But there the problem of resources come in

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-026#147:1:A>
Dr Sen Gupta <,> I I did feel that bringing the the ambition
and the aim of bringing the growth rate of <.> popula </.> no not the growth
rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-026#148:1:A>
<}> <-> The the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> fertility rate or the
birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to <,> twenty per thousand
within a five year period is a <,> is a I think a pipe dream really <,> </I>
