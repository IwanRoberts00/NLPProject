<&> recording broken </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#1:1:A>
The journey was <,> by itself not attracting much attention <,> seem  
to take longer than usual <,> at last I was at the door step <,> and on  
entering the house <,> first thing that I learnt <,> was that my cousins had  
not arrived <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#2:1:A>
Suddenly the journey that I had just completed <,> appeared to be  
much more troublesome <,> than what it actually was <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#3:1:A>
Every part of my body <,> began complaining loud and clear <,> not  
being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by <,> by my aunt I  
slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake <,> would wake me up in the  
morning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#4:1:A>
The dawn passed <,> and so did the noon <,> and the sun had <}> <->  
began </-> <+> begun </+> </}> to set 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#5:1:A>
The phone bell rang <,> having grown tired of waiting <,> and having  
cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear <,> I was  
convinced that the phone carried a message <,> saying we would be arriving on  
twenty-sixth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#6:1:A>
But no <,> my spirits were once again reaching sky high <,> when I  
heard that Raju had rung from the <}> <-> <.> Pu </.> </-> <=> Pune </=> </}>  
railway station itself <,> and in no more than half an hour <,> there <,> we  
were all beholding this great man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#7:1:A>
He was indeed given a rousing welcome <,> under my leadership <,>  
after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members <,> I  
was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair <,>  
was not as much compared to mine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#8:1:A>
Trying to defend ourselves <,> of this adventure or misadventure <,>  
that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism <,> which was whole  
heartedly poured on us <,> we realised that it was just <,> a couple of <,>  
hours before the departure of the Jhelum <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#9:1:A>
Jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from Pune as scheduled <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#10:1:A>
And the two of us <,> sitting facing each other <,> deeply <,>  
engaged in studying the railway time table <,> where <,> we were to go and  
how <,,> the train <,> sped fast <,> and this was one of my first journey <,>  
in a vestibule train <,> which had an attached pantry car <,> and the sun  
<,,> was preparing to make way for the bright star of the night <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#11:1:A>
We decided to have our dinner <,> courtesy Indian railway <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#12:1:A>
Hardly <,> a few hours passed <,> we thought of stroll through the  
compartment <,> and believe me what a sight it was <,,> with the new  
considerations to our ages <,> there was enough happenings around <,> that  
made us a little uneasy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#13:1:A>
For a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas <,>  
being screened <,> all around 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#14:1:A>
When the noise of food <,> being served <,> made us rush back to  
our seat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#15:1:A>
The food was interesting <,> not delicious <,> as such <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#16:1:A>
My cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#17:1:A>
Sleep thrust <,> in with a mixed feelings <,> having decided to  
make all the purchases <,> that were to be done at Pune we reached Delhi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#18:1:A>
The train was to halt there for three hours <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#19:1:A>
The experience <,> in travelling <,> in a vestibule train <,> with  
an attached pantry car <,> the unknown destination and happiness or hardship  
that were to be part of the journey <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#20:1:A>
Both my cousin and myself <,> are always used to sound sleep <,,>  
in the night <,> immaterial of the time <,> place etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#21:1:A>
When the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of  
India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#22:1:A>
We were travelling through the terrain of Chambal valley <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#23:1:A>
The numerous hillocks <,> with tricky passages in between <,> we  
believed were the most apt for hideout <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#24:1:A>
Admittedly <,> many had discovered this fact much before us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#25:1:A>
The vast expanse of such similar pattern <,> did indeed put up a  
scenery <,> quite unforgettable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#26:1:A>
Suddenly this gave <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> instinct to my  
<w> cousin's </w> mind <,> <quote> Why not plan the return journey </quote>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#27:1:A>
We were to reach Delhi by eight p m <,> and the train was to halt  
there for full three hours <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#28:1:A>
If the journey through central India <,> is so beautiful how would  
it be to return along the west coast <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#29:1:A>
Brilliant idea indeed <,> and the railway time table was once again  
searched <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#30:1:A>
Before all this <,,> was completed we reached Jhansi station <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#31:1:A>
On the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary  
<,> a beautiful <,,> blue and yellow colour train <,> the engine shaped like  
an aeroplane <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#32:1:A>
<quote> O yes <,> it was indeed <,> the two thousand one up <,>  
Shatabdi Express <,> the fastest train in India </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#33:1:A>
And as though <,> to remind us all about the journey we had a  
glimpse of the derailed bogies <,> of the unfortunate <mention> Karnataka  
Express </mention> little further <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#34:1:A>
All this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#35:1:A>
As if to prove the station master right <,> when he writes below  
the time table in station <,> <quote> Trains are liable to gain or lose time  
</quote> <,> Jhelum Express screeched into the New Delhi station only three  
and half hours late <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#36:1:A>
Off <,> we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be  
enlightened by the vendor <,> that the counter in the station closed by five  
thirty p m <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#37:1:A>
All our hopes were dashed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#38:1:A>
We had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at New Delhi  
station <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#39:1:A>
We were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and  
transferred to Jammu Tavi <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#40:1:A>
We had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the  
food <,,> at New Delhi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#41:1:A>
Midnight vendor <,> and some <indig> fruitwalas </indig> made our  
appetite full <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#42:1:A>
The halt was cut down by an hour and a half <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#43:1:A>
And by one in the morning we started advancing further north <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#44:1:A>
The crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number <,>  
with large group <,> detraining at various stops <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#45:1:A>
The last of our companions <,> got down at Jallandhar <,> leaving  
only two of us from the original pack <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#46:1:A>
The pantry car too was disconnected at Delhi <,> and when we woke  
up in the morning <quote> My goodness <,> what a sight it was <,,> with green  
lustrious inviting plains <,> of Punjab </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#47:1:A>
<-> Far </-> as far as the eyes could see <,> spread over from one  
horizon to the other <,> the vast stretch of land as though somebody had  
levelled it <,> totally green <,,> thick with vegetation with a lot of  
streams running in between <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#48:1:A>
Oh what a place it was <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#49:1:A>
As the arrival time <,> at the Jammu Tavi station neared <,> we  
were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of Himalaya <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#50:1:A>
After <indig> chhole parathe </indig> at Pathankot the train did  
come to a halt on a platform which borne the name <mention> Jammu Tavi  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#51:1:A>
But where were the hills <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#52:1:A>
Sense dawned that they were to begin further north <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#53:1:A>
Trapped by a local commission agent <,> we were <,,> about to  
reside in a lodge <,> when yet another person showed us a bus standing right  
in front of us <,> which was bound to Shrinagar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#54:1:A>
It has the name board in Urdu <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#55:1:A>
Thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus <,> and the  
final leg of the journey had begun <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#56:1:A>
In sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was  
unique <,> the hills for which we had been longing for <,> so long <,> were  
right in front of us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#57:1:A>
And our bus began its quest towards Shrinagar <,> about two hundred  
and forty-eight kilometres drive <,> roughly five hours by our calculation  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#58:1:A>
The bus began to turn right <,> left <,> right and <,> I lost count  
at the number of turns <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#59:1:A>
There was a range of mountains in front of us <,> and slowly the  
bus began to scale its height 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#60:1:A>
And <,> just as the last curve took us to the <,> upper most point  
of it and there was yet another range of mountains <,> taller than that <,>  
of the previous one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#61:1:A>
At the end of it <,,> again there was yet another range <,> it was  
as if the Himalayas were unfolding themselves <,> layer by layer <,> and you  
never knew <,> what was beyond that curve <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#62:1:A>
There was <,> no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that  
were seeming sky high now <,> began appearing reasonable <,> and as night  
approached we reached Baltal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#63:1:A>
Just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of  
remaining journey in darkness <,> the driver announced that the bus was to  
halt overnight at Baltal 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#64:1:A>
And begin the quest early next morning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#65:1:A>
We were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#66:1:A>
The next morning as the mountains continued to show their great  
might and energy <,> with roaring of streams in the valley <,> getting louder  
around each curve <,> and streams themselves <,> becoming smaller in size  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#67:1:A>
The bus then was halted in a queue <,> and a curious stroll gave us  
the glimpse <,> of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#68:1:A>
The Jawaharlal Nehru tunnel <,> the longest of its kind and  
appropriately <}> <-> it was <.> insc </.> </-> <,> <=> it was inscribed </=>  
</}> <,> may your life be as long as this tunnel <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#69:1:A>
Photography was prohibited <,> and the journey through this  
twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of <,> another  
amazing array of mountains <,> each of them <,> trying to make the other  
appear smaller <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#70:1:A>
The clouds were almost with us now <,> and we did still <,> keep  
climbing higher and higher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#71:1:A>
It was almost began to seem endless <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#72:1:A>
I had in my school days <,,> seen Ooty <,> but by now we must have  
travelled the road to Ooty <,> say about ten times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#73:1:A>
Almost every inch of these mountains <,> had tall trees <,> trying  
to out do the mountains in reaching the sky <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#74:1:A>
Following this was again a long stretch of plain road <,,>  
impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land  
after this <,,> climb <,,> but then it was the Kashmir valley <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#75:1:A>
Admiring beautiful nature we never realised <,,> that our bus by  
now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at Shrinagar  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#76:1:A>
Oh god <,> what a journey it had been <,> not a bit of this kind  
had ever occurred to us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#77:1:A>
No not even in the wildest of our dreams <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#78:1:A>
From there we proceeded <,> straight to the youth hostel camping  
grounds <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-036#79:1:A>
Thus <,> if you look into the journey itself <,> a lot of things do  
happen <,> that teach us lessons <,> in the philosophy <,> practicability  
etcetera <,> only it needs a willful learner <,,> </I>
