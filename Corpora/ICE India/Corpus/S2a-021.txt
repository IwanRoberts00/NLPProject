<I> 
 
<$A>
<ICE-IND:S2A-021#1:1:A>
What I wanted to look at was <,> all communication <,,> between  
different workers in industries at different levels <,> in <,> various  
organisations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#2:1:A>
Uh <,> and I was looking at 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#3:1:A>
I wanted to look at in fact I was interested in looking at <,> both  
<,> the reported use of <,> <-> in uh </-> English in industries <,> and <,,>  
uh <,> the actual use of <,,> uh English in industries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#4:1:A>
Uh <,> because I thought there would be a difference <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#5:1:A>
What you imagine you use <,> is not always <,> what you actually use  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#6:1:A>
Uh <,> you imagine you use a particular language <,> but when you  
<,> uh when you <-> are </-> observed <,> you find that there is or you  
observe yourself <,> you find that you are in fact <,> not <,> actually using  
what you thought or what you imagined you use <,> uh in different contexts  
with different people for different purposes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#7:1:A>
So I thought I would study both the aspects and compare the two <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#8:1:A>
Unfortunately for me <,> I was not allowed to record <,> anything at  
all <,,> in industries <,> because <,> for uh they felt that for security  
reasons <,> they could not allow <,,> tape recorders <,> on <-> to </->  
campus 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#9:1:A>
Now this is one of the disadvantages <,> this is one of the  
constraints <,> under which I was working <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#10:1:A>
So I thought <,> well I confine myself to reported use only <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#11:1:A>
And how did I go about this <,> uhm <,> well <,,> I thought I would  
select industries in Andhra Pradesh <,> that is uh <,> for no other reason  
except that I work <,,> there and I thought it would be easy for me to have  
access to various industries in Andhra Pradesh <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#12:1:A>
Now how was I to decide <,> which industries I should take up for  
<,> my study <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#13:1:A>
Uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide  
initially <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#14:1:A>
Then I thought <,> I would look at <,,> uh a comparatively <,> uh  
industrially advanced area <,,> industrially advanced area <,> and a <.> sta  
</.> uh uh uh <,> a district that was industrially backward so that I would  
have the two extremes <,> uh uh for my study <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#15:1:A>
Uh <,> <.> ju </.> <,> for that reason I said <quote> okay  
Hyderabad is industrially more advanced <,> and Karnool district <,,> is  
industrially backward </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#16:1:A>
So I took up <-> these two districts </-> the industries in these  
two districts <,> for my study <,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#17:1:A>
Now what kind of <,> study was I going to <,,> get <,,> a  
representative industrial population from <,> that again was very difficult  
for me to decide <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#18:1:A>
Uh finally I did some reading <,> I uh <,> did a bit of study <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#19:1:A>
I tried to find out get information about the kind of industries  
one could have 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#20:1:A>
And <,> I broadly classified these industries <,> and there there  
is a classification available <,> uh in the literature <,> uh into public  
sector undertaking <,,> and private sector undertaking <,> undertaking <,>  
that was <,> the main classification <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#21:1:A>
And then the other <,,> factor that I thought <,> might affect <,,>  
the use of language <,,> uh was location of industry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#22:1:A>
And this was very convenient for me to do <,> because Karnool  
district being backward had a large number of <,> rural industries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#23:1:A>
Now let me explain what I mean by rural <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#24:1:A>
<-> I </-> by rural I don't mean <,,> a completely rural area <,>  
because that would be contradictory in terms 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#25:1:A>
You can't have an industry <,> where you don't have the  
infrastructure for <,> for an industry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#26:1:A>
So let us say <,> by rural I meant <,> very small towns <,> or <,>  
uhm <,,> probably you would understand <indig> Taluk </indig> better <,,> at  
the subdivision levels <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#27:1:A>
So uh <,> I classified my industries <,> and I <,> selected  
industries from Hyderabad <,,> public <,> and private 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#28:1:A>
And then Hyderabad <,> provided me with the urban sector <,> and  
<,> uhm Karnool with <,> rural <,> industries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#29:1:A>
Then I decided on how I was going to collect this data <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#30:1:A>
And uh <,> since I <,> had to <,> I was almost compelled to <,>  
look at only reported use <,> I had to think about <,> how I was going to go  
about <,> uh collecting data for reported use of English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#31:1:A>
Uh when I say English <,> uh please don't imagine that I <,> forgot  
about the Indian languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#32:1:A>
I always looked at the use of English <,> <foreign> vis a vis  
</foreign> the Indian languages that the <,> employees there <,> uh in these  
industries were using <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#33:1:A>
Now as far as methodology is concerned I thought <,> I would go  
about it <,,> by <,> first of all observing what went on <,> in these  
industries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#34:1:A>
So general uh <,,> observation <,,> and I followed this up <,> by a  
questionnaire <,,> and I refined my questionnaire as I went along on the  
basis of the observation <,,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#35:1:A>
After <,,> my informants filled in the questionnaire I went about  
interviewing <,> some of them 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#36:1:A>
I couldn't have interviewed <,> uh <,> all the informants because I  
had nearly four hundred informants <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#37:1:A>
But I <,> uh took a fairly large population <,> and uh <,> and  
therefore <,,> I was able to uhm <,> interview quite a large number <,,> of  
informants <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#38:1:A>
Uh <,> having collected the questionnaire <,> I would look at their  
responses and then base my interviews <,> on <,> the basis of those uh uh <,>  
of their answers to my questions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#39:1:A>
One <,> to check whether they were aware of what they had <,>  
answered <,> they were aware of the reasons for their answers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#40:1:A>
Also <,> to check whether they had <,> in fact <,> read the  
questionnaire carefully <,> and uh <,> had answered these correctly 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#41:1:A>
Some of them <,> in fact it turned out that some of them in fact  
were not aware of what they have done 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#42:1:A>
They had just put <,> <mention> ticks </mention> and <mention>  
crosses </mention> <,> uh <,> for the sake of <,> completing the  
questionnaire <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#43:1:A>
So I had to do that to cross check <,> to make sure that they did  
fill in <,> the questionnaires <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#44:1:A>
When uh <,> I <,> uh analysed this <w> I'm </w> I am saying all  
this very briefly because I wouldn't like to go into detail <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#45:1:A>
I analysed <,> uh <,> these questionnaires the <,> uh <,> all that  
I have collected and <,,> also <,> uh <,,> recorded my observations <,> of  
their behaviour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#46:1:A>
And I tried to look at <,> the association <,> or the relationship  
<,> between <-> the use </-> <,> their use of English <,> with <,,> their  
<,,> superiors <,,> equals <,,> and their juniors <,,> and <?> relation </?>  
to <,> the social variables <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#47:1:A>
That is the relationship between their use of English with <,>  
superiors <,> with equals and juniors <,> and with the social variables <,>  
type <,,> of industry <,,> that is either public or private <,,> location of  
industry <,> that is urban and rural <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#48:1:A>
Occupation <,,> and for occupation I had <,> the uh <,> higher  
level middle level and lower level of occupation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#49:1:A>
Education again <,> I had the higher level <,> middle level <,> and  
low level of education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#50:1:A>
Medium of instruction in school <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#51:1:A>
And <-> I had <,> I I </-> I chose medium of instruction in school  
because that is where <,> the the main differences is <,> some people have  
English and some people have <,> a regional languages or Indian languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#52:1:A>
And <,> exposure to English that is <,> whether they in fact <,>  
were exposed to a lot of English <,> as far as their reading was concerned  
<,,> magazines <,,> journals 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#53:1:A>
Now this would also be uh I I predicted that this would be <,> uh  
related to their jobs as well <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#54:1:A>
Depending on <,> what their job was they would probably read the  
kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#55:1:A>
Now in addition to this <,,> I also looked at their attitudes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#56:1:A>
And I must admit I found it very difficult to assess their  
attitudes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#57:1:A>
I did get some <,> uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#58:1:A>
Uh and I <}> <-> <.> ag </.> </-> <=> again </=> </}> related these  
attitudes their attitudes to English <,,> to the the variables that I had  
taken up earlier type and location of industries <,> occupation <,> education  
<,> medium of instruction <,> exposure to English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#59:1:A>
Uh <,,> now <,,> <O> cough </O> from my analysis <,,> of the  
questionnaire <,,> and on the basis of my observation of their behaviour <,,>  
on the basis of my interviews <,,> uh <,,> these were the <,> uh the  
conclusions <,,> I drew <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#60:1:A>
The most general <,> general conclusion that I drew was <,,> that  
<,,> these people <,,> who are professionals <,,> who work in these  
industries <,,> had a very <,> functional <,,> professional attitude <,> to  
the use of English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#61:1:A>
They don't have <,,> a political bias <,> at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#62:1:A>
They are not bothered about <,,> whether the language ought to be  
taught <,,> or introduced at school <,> or college or not <,,> except <,,>  
when a except uh uh <,,> they would be bothered of course <.> ex </.> only  
when <,> they were <,> uh they considered the utility of that language for  
their profession <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#63:1:A>
They felt <,,> that <,,> they needed English <,> for certain  
purposes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#64:1:A>
They needed English <,,> to talk to <,> uh their superiors for  
instance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#65:1:A>
Now <,,> looking at the variables <,,> I found <,,> that <,,> the  
location of industry <,> was a very very important <,> variable <,,> as far  
as <,> the uh use of English was concerned <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#66:1:A>
It was a very important variable <,> which affected the use of  
English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#67:1:A>
Employees in rural industries for example <,> specially those <,>  
who had to deal <,> with handloom <,,> for instance <,> who had to deal with  
spinning and weaving <,,> and who use only indigenous <,> uh technology <,,>  
did not need the use of English <,,> as much as did those who used foreign  
technology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#68:1:A>
And <,> in fact their view on this was <,,> that <,> <-> they </->  
as long as they were <,,> <-> uh they were </-> not as advanced <,,> as the  
western countries <,> and uh one of them used the word begging-bowl <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#69:1:A>
They had to use this begging-bowl <,,> for technology and knowledge  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#70:1:A>
They would <,> be compelled <,,> to use <,,> those languages <,,>  
that helped them to have access to <,,> science and technology <,> to all  
knowledge that would help them to <-> uh <.> adva </.> uh to uh </-> to be  
industrially advanced <,,> that was their view about <,> the use of English  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#71:1:A>
Now <,> the other <,> the the the other variable that I found was  
very important <,,> was interlocutors that is those <,> uh they the use of  
English <,> depended on whether <,,> an employee was <,,> conversing with his  
superior <,> equal <,> or <,> junior <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#72:1:A>
And more English naturally was used while conversing with superiors  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#73:1:A>
Another variable that was important was occupation 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#74:1:A>
This was another important variable that affected the use of <,>  
language <,> and that also included the nature of their job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#75:1:A>
Those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to  
talk about technical matters <,> more than those who were dealing for  
instance <,> with <,> administration who were not directly concerned with  
production <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#76:1:A>
Those who were directly concerned with production <,> used much  
more English <,> and felt they needed much more English <,> because their job  
required them to use more English than those who dealt with administrative  
matters <,> there were for instance <,> the personnel <,,> branch <,> where  
they had to deal even with the <,> with uh with all those workers <,> from  
the shop-floor <,> for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms  
and shoes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#77:1:A>
Now <,> they did not need English <,> to converse <,> with <,> <->  
those uh with with </-> workers from the shop-floor and doors 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#78:1:A>
So they needed to use English much less than those who were <->  
technically </-> <,> highly technically qualified <,> and uh were required to  
discuss technical matters <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#79:1:A>
Uh <,,> the another another factor that affected English <,> a  
great deal the use of English a great deal was context <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#80:1:A>
This was a very important <,> uh factor <,> which affected the use  
of English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#81:1:A>
Uh <,,> formerly for instance when they were at a meeting <,,> and  
I sat in them some of their meetings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#82:1:A>
When they were <,> uhm talking to <,> customers from outside <,,>  
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions <,,>  
they tended to use much more English <,,> than they did <,> when they were  
say at a social get together <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#83:1:A>
I attended some of their social get togethers <,> and I found <,>  
that their get togethers were much more relaxed <,,> much more informal <,>  
and therefore there was less and less use of English <,> more and more <,>  
use of Indian languages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#84:1:A>
Uh uh I am afraid I coudn't quantify <,> the exact <,> uh uh use of  
English <-> and </-> <,> versus the Indian languages but I can only say that  
there was a client <,> English at the level of formality <,> and this as we  
went down to more and more <,> informal levels <,> uh became <,> more and  
more minus English <,> and more and more plus Indian languages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#85:1:A>
And also their attitudes <,> as I said earlier <,> their attitudes  
to <,> uh the use of English <,> uh were all based on <,> the need for  
English <,,> the various functions they had to perform <,> and they felt <,>  
that if a language <,> helps them to do the job well <,> well that was the  
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a  
prestige value or not <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#86:1:A>
For them <,> it was uh <,> and some of them in fact said <,>  
sometimes it was an Indian language that uh <,> works as a lubricant <,> they  
call it a lubricant <,> if they wanted to <,> uh get a job done <,> they  
would suddenly switch over <-> to their uh </-> <,> to their mother tongue  
<,> or to the local language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#87:1:A>
They they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue  
<,> certainly not <,> which ever language they thought <,> they could <}> <->  
<.> effect </.> </-> <,> <=> effectively </=> </}> communicate in <,> was  
used between them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#88:1:A>
And of course <,> most of them felt <,> that English <,> was very  
essential for science and technology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#89:1:A>
Now this is very interesting 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#90:1:A>
It was very essential for an <w> individual's </w> job  
opportunities and success at work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#91:1:A>
It was very essential for interstate communication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#92:1:A>
It was <,,> not <,> at all essential for English at home <,> for  
for communication at home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#93:1:A>
Uh about English for education <,> it is interesting to note that  
<,> they had <,,> uh <,> different views <,> some of them felt <,> that <,>  
we should have English all the way <,,> so that all the sections of the  
people <,> would get uh <,> fair opportunity <,> to learn the language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#94:1:A>
And therefore go up the social <,> scale <,> and also <,> uh uh get  
more opportunities for work and for jobs <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#95:1:A>
Uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn English at uh  
uh upto primary school at the primary level <,> because we should be <,> we  
should give our children more opportunities <,> to learn our own <->  
languages </-> Indian languages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#96:1:A>
Some of them felt <,> that English should be introduced <,> only  
<,,> uh after middle school <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#97:1:A>
They they felt that there was no need to <-> do to </-> introduce  
English <,> and after middle school too <,> it should be taught only as a  
subject upto high school <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#98:1:A>
And it was only <,> uh they were all of course unanimous in saying  
that English should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of  
instruction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#99:1:A>
So these are some of the <,> <-> as if the the </-> findings of the  
study <,> I haven't gone into very great detail <,> because that would have  
taken me the whole day almost <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-021#100:1:A>
Uh these are some of the interesting findings that <-> we <,> uh  
that uh </-> I came up with <,> at uh at the end of the the the study <,>  
</I>
