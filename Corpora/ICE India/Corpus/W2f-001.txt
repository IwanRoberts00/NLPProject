<ICE-IND:W2F-001#3:1>
A surprising change was coming over Zeba.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#4:1>
She had started saying <indig> namaz </indig> and this had greatly
pleased her mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#5:1>
She also went to hold classes for the illiterate Muslim women of the
<indig> <it> mohalla </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#6:1>
Every day when her school finished she would go to teach these women,
which had again pleased her mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#7:1>
Many of her classfellows at school often came to her house and held
meetings there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#8:1>
They discussed ways of improving the lot of the Muslim residents of
the city.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#9:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb heartily approved of this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#10:1>
<quote> " I greatly appreciate what you are doing for their
betterment," </quote> one day <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb told <w> Zeba's
</w> friend, Mahmood.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#11:1>
<X> <quote> " But why don't you ask the Hindu boys and girls also to
join you?" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#12:1>
<X> <quote> " Hindus will tell them to learn Hindi while we teach
Urdu to these illiterate folk.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X13:1>
There is no arrangement for learning Urdu," </quote> </X> Mahmood
replied.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#14:1>
He was a handsome youth, belonging to a well-to-do family.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#15:1>
What he had said had undoubtedly some weight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#16:1>
Ever since Hindi had been declared the official language of the
state, Urdu had been pushed into the background.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#17:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb had heard that in schools even Muslim
children were required to learn Hindi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#18:1>
When an Urdu teacher retired his post was not filled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#19:1>
New schools were being opened just for the purpose of teaching Hindi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#20:1>
No Urdu books were being published and many Urdu magazines and
newspapers had closed down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#21:1>
Even the Urdu newspapers that were in existence were influenced by
Hindi papers such as <it> Milap </it> , <it> Pratap </it> , <it> Hind
Samachar </it> and <it> Tej </it> , to name only a few. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#22:1>
<quote> " Also, <indig> Ammijan </indig> , we are trying to get
jobs for Muslims," </quote> Mahmood explained to the <indig> Begum </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#23:1>
What winsome manners he had and how soft-spoken.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#24:1>
<X> <quote> " How can Hindu boys help there?

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X25:1>
We believe that Muslims should get jobs in the police, defence
services, in the factories and in the other government departments strictly
in proportion to their population.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X26:1>
For one thing, the‘ left vacant by the Muslims migrating to Pakistan
should have been filled by Muslims alone." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#27:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb was convinced that there was some
truth in what Mahmood was saying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#28:1>
<X> <quote> " And, <indig> Ammijan </indig> , what is of even
greater importance is that Muslims should be given full opportunities in
business and industry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X29:1>
The government should advance them loans on easy terms and freely
issue licences to them to establish new factories and mills.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X30:1>
If timely steps are not taken to correct the situation, the Indian
Muslims will end up as slaves of the Hindus.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X31:1>
We would be living at their mercy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X32:1>
We would have to look to them even for two square meals every day."
</quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#33:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb was inclined to agree with what
Mahmood was saying.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#34:1>
<quote> " Indian Muslims have to live and die in India," </quote> she
said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#35:1>
<X> <quote> " Their destiny is aligned with this country, their
interests must be safeguarded.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X36:1>
Now they must stop looking to Pakistan." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#37:1>
<X> <quote> " But why not?

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X38:1>
We created Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X39:1>
Pakistan is our destiny," </quote> </X> Mahmood argued. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#40:1>
<quote> " You mean you have no responsibility towards your own
country?" </quote> <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb asked in some surprise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#41:1>
<X> <quote> " My country?" </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#42:1>
Mahmood gave a bitter laugh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#43:1>
<X> <quote> " <indig> Ammijan </indig> , India has been partitioned
on the basis of the two-nation theory - the Hindus and the Muslims.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X44:1>
Now we have to see whether Hindus will allow remaining Muslims to
live here with dignity or not." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#45:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb kept looking at the young man but
her mind was somewhere else. </p>

No sacrifice can be too great for this.

We are prepared for it.

He was a victim of Hindu tricks.

This country has not produced a more bigoted Hindu than <indig>

Could there be a more hard-boiled politician than the <indig>
Mahatma </indig> ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X57:1>
If Sardar Patel and <indig> Pandit </indig> Nehru had not put their
foot down he would not have allowed Pakistan to come into existence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X58:1>
He was the one who created all the trouble for the Indian Muslims.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X59:1>
He always has a Muslim stooge at his beck and call - an Azad, a
Kidwai or a Zakir Husain.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X60:1>
His intention is to keep the Indian Muslims on the leash.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X61:1>
He is out to snatch away their language and fiddle with their jobs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X62:1>
As for trade and industry Muslims have already been sidelined.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X63:1>
In course of time they would despite themselves be carried away by
the Hindu stream.

Today Zeba is more proficient in Hindi than in Urdu.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X68:1>
She folds her hands and says <indig> namaste </indig> to everyone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X69:1>
I don't see her bowing her head and saying <indig> adaab </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X70:1>
There was a time when they used to broadcast <indig> naats </indig>
and <indig> hamzas </indig> , <indig> qawwalis </indig> and <indig> ghazals
</indig> from the Lucknow radio station.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X71:1>
Today you hardly hear an Urdu programme over the radio.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X72:1>
The language of the news broadcast from All India Radio is becoming
more and more unfamiliar as the days pass.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X73:1>
The other day someone was saying that these radio people do not
broadcast news in Hindi but they propagate Hindi in the news.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X74:1>
So far as I am concerned I fail to make much sense of our news
bulletins.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X75:1>
Every morning and evening I make it a point to tune in to Pakistan
Radio for the <w> day's </w> news." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#76:1>
As Mahmood took out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his
face a wad of hundred-rupee notes came out and fell on the floor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#77:1>
He quickly picked up the packet and put it back into his pocket.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#78:1>
Then he got up to go.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#79:1>
A car had come to fetch him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#80:1>
It was a big, shiny limousine, with a young boy at the wheel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#81:1>
There were other boys and girls in the car. </p> ‘

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#82:1>
Since that day <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb had relented towards
Zeba.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#83:1>
The girl was all the time collecting books on Islam and Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#84:1>
The Urdu programmes from Lahore radio station were most attractive.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#85:1>
She tuned in to these programmes morning and evening and listened
in to them along with her <indig> Ammi </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#86:1>
These days <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb drew great comfort by
listening to the Quran Shareef broadcast from the Lahore radio station.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#87:1>
So many troubles had assailed her all at one time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#88:1>
Recitation of <w> Allah's </w> name gave her great solace.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#89:1>
Once she sat down to listen to those <indig> qawwalis </indig> and
hymns, she found it difficult to tear herself away from the radio.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#90:1>
In contrast, All India Radio was such a bore - mostly singing of
classical music, news read in unintelligible Hindi or broadcasts relating to
national development projects.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#91:1>
All this just passed over her head. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#92:1>
At long last there was a letter from Lahore from Ismet which had
come by hand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#93:1>
Zeba spluttered with rage as she read the letter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#94:1>
The Amritsar police had not permitted the Recovery squad coming from
Lahore to arrest Seema.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#95:1>
The contingent had taken away truckloads of abducted Muslim girls
from Amritsar proper and from neighbouring villages.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#96:1>
But the local police had not allowed them to visit <w> Seema's </w>
house, their plea being that nobody could have abducted a graduate girl
against her wishes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#97:1>
Besides, <w> Seema's </w> mother was still living in India.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#98:1>
The <w> girl's </w> brother might be living in London but he was
still a citizen of India.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#99:1>
They had property worth <indig> lakhs </indig> of rupees in Meerut.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#100:1>
After the formation of Pakistan no member of their family had
migrated to Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#101:1>
No doubt they had some relations there but they had been living
there long before Pakistan came into existence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#102:1>
Ismet had written in her letter: <X> <quote> " My husband is not one
to admit defeat so easily.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X103:1>
He has planned with a member of the Pakistani police to bring back
Seema forcibly with the next batch of abducted girls.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#X104:1>
Once she crosses the border we shall manage the rest." </quote>
</X>

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#105:1>
Ismet was confident that her husband would succeed in his mission.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#106:1>
But it seemed that success had again eluded her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#107:1>
As days passed <w> Ismet's </w> hope receded.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#108:1>
It appeared they had‘ an iron wall around Seema which none could
demolish.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#109:1>
No one could lay hands upon her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#110:1>
She had even stopped writing to her mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#111:1>
In fact <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb herself wanted to break off
all connections with Seema.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#112:1>
She had developed a prejudice against her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#113:1>
For the last few days she had been struggling with the doubt that
maybe her late husband had been following the wrong trail and there was truth
in what her younger daughter was dinning into her ears day in and day out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#114:1>
Her doubts were enhanced by the other young men and girls who
regularly visited her house and tried to brainwash her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#115:1>
Then the doctor who was treating <indig> Sheikh </indig> Shabbir
suggested that he should be sent to Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#116:1>
Maybe that would put the <indig> Sheikh </indig> in a proper frame
of mind and lead to his cure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#117:1>
Even <indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb sometimes toyed with the idea of
migrating to Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#118:1>
Let the property go to hell.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#119:1>
The more important thing was to keep body and soul together for
which she had enough money.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#120:1>
She felt that if she stayed on in India she might also lose her
balance like her brother-in-law.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#121:1>
The pendulum of her life was already swinging violently between
India and Pakistan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#122:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb felt utterly confused </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#123:1>
<h> <&> chapter </&> 10 </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#124:1>
At last the <indig> Begum </indig> made up her mind to migrate
to Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#125:1>
This time she was firm about it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#126:1>
She started looking around for customers for her property.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#127:1>
A couple of deals had even gone through. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#128:1>
Zeba was pleased, very pleased.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#129:1>
And Ismet was the happiest of them all; in her letters she was
almost bubbling with joy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#130:1>
<indig> Sheikh </indig> Shabbir was equally happy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#131:1>
His sister-in-law would enhance his prestige in the community.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#132:1>
Her going away would add another feather in his cap.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#133:1>
Also, if she stayed back while he went, whenever communal trouble
broke out in India or a Pakistani leader made a statement against India,
Shabbir would worry about the <indig> Begum </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#134:1>
She could become the target of communal anger. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#135:1>
<indig> Sheikh </indig> Shabbir had sold his valuable property
for a song.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#136:1>
He made satisfactory arrangements to send his cash and gold and
jewellery to Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#137:1>
The only question that remained to be finally decided was as to the
place where he would ultimately settle down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#138:1>
All the cities of Pakistan were already overcrowded, with not an
inch of‘ left for the newcomers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#139:1>
A large number of migrants from India were still living in refugee
camps.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#140:1>
Nobody seemed to be anxious about rehabilitating them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#141:1>
The luckier ones could find shelter with their relatives for ten
days, twenty days, a month or even two months.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#142:1>
But what would they do after that?

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#143:1>
They could not be hangers-on for ever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#144:1>
<indig> Sheikh </indig> <w> Shabbir's </w> mind was already made
up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#145:1>
His people had decided that even if he and his family had to starve
they would prefer to die in Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#146:1>
He would not stay in India a moment longer than necessary because
his condition was deteriorating day by day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#147:1>
When <indig> Begum </indig> <w> Haseeb's </w> son who was living
in London learnt that she was thinking of migrating to Pakistan he strongly
advised her against such a step.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#148:1>
The conditions in Pakistan, he wrote to her, were none too good.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#149:1>
Even those who had migrated there in a hurry were now repenting at
leisure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#150:1>
The Panjabis of Pakistan would not allow an outsider to strike
roots there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#151:1>
They were specially hostile towards the Muslims of UP whom they
contemptuously called <quote> " <indig> Bhaiyyas </indig> " </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#152:1>
They never tired of making fun of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-001#153:1>
<indig> Begum </indig> Haseeb was in a dilemma again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#154:1>
As for Zeba, she was all the time praising the fashionable girls of
Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#155:1>
She had several pairs of <indig> salwar-kameez </indig> stitched for
herself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#156:1>
She was particular about the width of the <indig> salwar </indig>
and the girth of the <indig> kameez </indig> which should conform to the
Pakistani style.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#157:1>
And, above all, their colour scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#158:1>
A shop in the Anarkali bazar of Lahore was named Pazeb and another
went by the name of Kahkashan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-001#159:1>
Zeba had already become knowledgeable with the lay-out of Lahore and
bragged to her mother about it. </p> </I>
