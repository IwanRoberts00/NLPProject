<bold> TOP OF THE WORLD, MICROSCOPICALLY SPEAKING </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ON </smallcaps> </bold> April 22, scientists of
the Fermilab in the USA created, for the first time, a subatomic particle
called Top, fulfilling a 30-year-old dream. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#5:1>
According to the currently accepted theory of matter, quarks are
the basic building blocks of matter, making up certain subatomic particles,
like protons, neutrons and mesons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#6:1>
Most subatomic particles are built of five types of quarks - - Up,
Down, Charm, Strange and Bottom.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#7:1>
But the prevalent theory requires the existence of the sixth quark,
namely <mention> Top </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#8:1>
One thing about <mention> Top </mention> is that it is heavy, much
heavier than any other elementary particle, though scientist don't know why
this is so.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#9:1>
For this reason, Top could only be created by high energy collisions
where energy gets converted into mass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#10:1>
In April, <mention> Top </mention> was sighted in a collision of
high energy beams of protons and electrons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#11:1>
Its measured mass - - 174 giga electron volts - - is 300,000 times
heavier than an electron, and verifies the standard theory of matter. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#12:1>
<h> <bold> NO MESSAGE IN BOTTLE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#13:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> landscape of
communications technology has been reworked in the last few years,
particularly in this country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#14:1>
On October 15, with the successful launch of a remote sensing
satellite IRS-P2, India became the sixth nation in the world capable of
launching payloads upto 1,000 kg.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#15:1>
It is also a potential contender in the multi-billion dollar launch
services market, dominated today by a select few. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#16:1>
This year also saw the establishment of an underwater
information highway in the Indian ocean.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#17:1>
SEA-ME--WE-2 ( South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-2 ) ,
the <w> world's </w> hongest optical fibre submarine cable ( 18.190 km long )
, links India with 12 other countries, serving as much as one-third of the
<w> world's </w> population.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#18:1>
By carrying international telephone calis, SEA-ME-WE-2 will
ease the burden of communication satellites <O> photograph above column
two and three </O> <O> caption </O> - - it can carry 60,000 simultaneous
conversations ( without echoes or other disturbances), at transmission
times of 20 milliseconds, compared to <w> satellites' </w> 500 milliseconds.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#19:1>
Then, Motorola <w> Inc's </w> Iridium project - - a global
network of 66 satellites to provide pocket-telephone service from
anywhere to anywhere in the world - - is expected to start from 1998.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#20:1>
The satellites will be placed in low earth orbits ( 463 miles above
the surface of the earth, compared to the 22,300 miles at which a
geostationary satellite is found ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#21:1>
The Iridium project uses miscrowaves ( higher in frequency and
shorter in wavelength than radio waves, microwaves can be concentrated into
directed beams more easily, making them more effective to locate objects )
and an electronic component called the moriolithic microwave integrated
circuit ( MMIC), earlier developed for radar systems in missiles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#22:1>
MMICs installed in telephone handsets will receive the micro-wave
signals. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#23:1>
<h> <bold> THINK SMALL - - AND DO BIG THINGS. </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#24:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> SCIENTISTS </smallcaps> </bold> were thinking
small as never before this year, all with an idea of doing big things.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#25:1>
Nanotechnology means making things in dimensions comparable to
those of atoms and molecules ( <w> that's </w> less than a billionth of a
metre ) to harvest the properties of such small atomic clusters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#26:1>
Metallurgists find that making alloys with metal powders
having nano-sized particles will make the alloy extremely strong.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#27:1>
Vanes of turbojet generators, walls of the containers housing
fuel rods in a nuclear reactor, material for bullet-proof vests - - all
these need to have extremely high mechanical strength.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#28:1>
In the field of electronics, nanotechnology promises to further
shrink computers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#29:1>
Nanomachine builders ultimately aim to make the machines
make themselves - - growing piece by piece, starting from their molecular
components, <O> photograph below column three, four and five </O> <O> caption
</O> into mammoth machines like earth movers, drawing component parts from
a molecular soup.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#30:1>
No, <w> it's </w> not just fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#31:1>
A chemist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US
has been able to design a molecule which can reproduce itself in this way.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#32:1>
Nanomachines can help save lives.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#33:1>
Surgeons will soon be able to insert tiny machines into the body for
diagnostic purposes - - like inserting tiny cameras inside the chest
without making large incisions - - reducing, for example, standard operation
incision sizes from 25 cm to just three cm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#34:1>
Of course, for such precision work the surgeon will need a robot.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#35:1>
Robodoc awaits approval for general distribution by the US Food and
Drug Administration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#36:1>
Its very first assignment will be at a hip transplant operation,
where it will carve out a hole int he thigh bone, aided by a computer and do
the job 10 times more accurately than a regular human would. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#37:1>
<h> <bold> PLAYING WITH GENES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#38:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> AMONG </smallcaps> </bold> the new
applications of biotechnology reported this year, the most important for
us is perhaps the one which explains how malaria parasites actually get into
blood cells. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#39:1>
Researches from The National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in the UK used genetic engineering to identify the
modus operandi of the parasite - - how and to what part of the cells
surface it binds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#40:1>
This opens up the possibility of synthesising or genetically
engineering an antibody ( antibodies protect against harmful viruses and
bacterial ) in such a size and shape to keep the parasites out of the cell.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#41:1>
Another attractive fallout of genetic engineering is the
possibility of using genetically engineered plants, instead of
animals, to make antibodies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#42:1>
This would make available inexpen,l>sive antibodies, in large
quantities, for use in medicine, pollution control and industrial
processing ( aquatic plants could be engineered to produce antibodies
that extract pollutants such as heavy metals from industrial effluents ) .

<bold> <smallcaps> MARCH </smallcaps> </bold> saw the release of a
final design for a Space Station jointly run by the European Space Agency,
the USA, Japan, Canada and Russia.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#45:1>
The largest international research and development project ever
undertaken will cost about 30 billion dollars. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#46:1>
The Space Station, whose construction is meant to start in
1997, will accommodate six crew members when completed, in 2002.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#47:1>
The 376 metric tonnes include six laboratory modules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#48:1>
The abundance of solar energy will meet all energy requirements.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#49:1>
Space is known to be ideal for processing materials - - high
quality crystals can be grown there, as gravity-induced effects are neglible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#50:1>
Metals and alloys can be processed without the use of a container,
through magnetic suspension - - by floating them inside
current-carrying coils - - and doing away with contamination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#51:1>
Without gravity pulling them down, molten substances can be held
in place by weak magnetic fileds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#52:1>
Biological samples can be separated into their components using
electric fields to yield pure samples. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#53:1>
The Space Station is the first step to the setting up of space
factories.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#54:1>

<h> <bold> ZAPPING CANCER WITH A CURRENT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#56:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> IN </smallcaps> </bold> cancer treatment, new
techniques are emerging, to selectively destroy cancerous cells without
damaging healthy cells, a significant hazard in conventional chemotherapy
and radiation treatments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#57:1>
In the forefront of such methods is electrochemotherapy, or ECT,
which is especially convenient for tumours in the brain and neck regions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#58:1>
ECT combines an electric field and chemotherapeutic agents, to
increase the uptake of drugs by tumour cells. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#59:1>
The plasma membrane of a cell which forms its outer wall does not
normally allow external molecules to enter into the cell.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#60:1>
ECT works by sending a short-lived, high-intensity electric pulse to
the tumour site.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#61:1>
The plasma membranes of the target cells temporarily collapses,
pores form on its surface, allowing the drug to pass through.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#62:1>
When the current is stopped, the pores reseal and regain their
original form.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#63:1>
ECT ensures that the drug enters only tumorous cells, reducing the
unwanted effects of chemotherapy. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#64:1>
<h> <bold> TINY CHEMICAL PLANTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#65:1>
<foreign> <bold> <smallcaps> ZEOLITE </smallcaps> </bold> </foreign>
means <quote> ` a boiling stone' </quote> in Greek.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#66:1>
It was named so by a Swedish mineralogist who found that this curious
compound bubbled and appeared to boil when heated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#67:1>
Actually, it was nothing but water escaping from the
innumerable pores present in its tiny crystals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#68:1>
These solids can hold an enormous amount of water in the millions of
molecularsized channels they contain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#69:1>
If all the channels in a teaspoon of <foreign> zeolite </foreign>
crystal were opened up, and laid side by side, they would cover a football
field! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#70:1>
Because of their porosity and other unusual properties,
zeolites are finding many uses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#71:1>
They have the twin ability to work as molecular sieves and then
trigger chemical reactions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#72:1>
The large surface area on their hollow surfaces allows many chemical
reactions to occur at least 50 times more efficiently than otherwise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#73:1>
Synthesised zeolites are being used extensively by chemists as
chemical plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#74:1>
For example, cadmium sulphide superclusters, made by first
injecting cadmium ions and then hydrogen sulphide gas into zeolite pores,
have potential applications as optical switches ( they are opaque or
transparent depending on how much light shines on them ) and are found to
work much faster than cadmium sulphide made from conventional routes.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#75:1>
Some other things being made by these tiny chemical plants;
optical memories based on tiny crystals of a light-sensitive material
created within a zeolite; chemical sensors consisting of a thin layer of
zeolite crystals; molecular sized filaments of conducting polymers <*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#78:2>
<bold> MY </bold> textbook perception of deserts as barren,
lifeless worlds was shattered some years ago, while on a filming project in
the Thar-Deserts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#79:2>
I discovered, abounded with life, especially around oases.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#80:2>
There were plants, birds and other wildlife.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#81:2>
In a single day, I sighted 40 kinds of birds, including vast
congregations of cranes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#82:2>
Now, that was a real, natural desert.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#83:2>
The term <quote> " desert" </quote> implies a dry, barren, treeless,
usually sandy, water-starved region.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#84:2>
But the desert is just one more type of habitat on earth, with its
own wildlife, beautifully adapted for the rigors of desert life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#85:2>
Nearly one-third of the <w> earth's </w> surface is desert or
semi-desert.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#86:2>
This arid and semi-arid part of the world is home for more than 750
million people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#87:2>
Natural deserts, spread over five of the seven continents, are no
cause for concern.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#88:2>
It is true that some present-day desert regions were once fertile
lands.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#89:2>
Centuries of over-use turned regions like Mesopotamia, often
described as the cradle of civilisation into desert.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#90:2>
But what is more disturbing right now is the 12 to 20 million
hectares <w> that's </w> being desertified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#91:2>
Though desertification is evident all over the world, it is
most conspicuous in Africa.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#92:2>
In Asia, nearly 40 per cent of the land is at a high risk of being
desertified.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#93:2>
Likewise, considerable stretches of land in Australia and the eastern
US are also fast deteriorating. </p> <O> photograph on column two and three
above </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#94:2>
Desertisation is not the same as desertification.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#95:2>
While the latter is the result of human activity, desertisation is
the natural spread of desert and desert-like habitats - - a very slow
process.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#96:2>
The threat we face today is of desertification. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#97:2>
The issue of desertification was brought into international focus
by the Sahel disaster of the early 1970s.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#98:2>
But the dimension of the problem was not fully realised at the
time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#99:2>
Recent estimates indicate that nearly 70 million hectares of Africa,
south of the Sahara, have been desertified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#100:2>
The Indian scenario is not much better.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#101:2>
Nearly 12 per cent of the <w> country's </w> geographical area is
desert, mostly in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and parts of Punjab.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#102:2>
Then there are the cold high-altitude deserts of Ladakh and northern
Himachal Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#103:2>
Indian deserts are biologically rich though they lie in the zone of
lowest pressure in the monsoons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#104:2>
Some 600 species of plants, 50 species of mammals and over 100
species of birds are to be found here.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#105:2>
Indian deserts are also zones of immense economic value.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#106:2>
They are the most populated deserts in the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#107:2>
<w> India's </w> desert regions are home to nearly 20 million
people with a population densi,l>ty of 61 people/sq km: most other desert
regions have a density of about 4-5 people/sq km.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#108:2>
Worse still, there are 22 million cattle, sheep and goats grazing
and browsing in Indian deserts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#109:2>
Thus, man and beast are gnawing away into a fragile world,
degrading the miles of land surrounding these regions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#110:2>
It is officially estimated that over 50 per cent of the <w>
country's </w> total area is in some state of degradation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#111:2>
The reasons for desertification are directly connected to
human activities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#112:2>
We have over-cultivated traditionally poor soil and have let
livestock run havoc on land that was not geared to face this onslaught; we
have robbed our planet of nearly half its forests, including those in
critical upland watershed regions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#113:2>
Our improper irrigation practices have caused excessive
salinisation and alkalisation of soil, making it useless for
agricultural use and leading to desertification.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#114:2>
Developmental schemes devised to bring in more water are beginning
to backfire - - the desert ecology is not geared to absorb a flood of water.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#115:2>
The objectives of desert-related projects have been soil and
water management, management of pastoral communities and raising livestock
productivity levels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-027#116:2>
It has to be acknowledged that a judicious management of water (
and soil ) will be the key to <quote> " prosperity" </quote> in the <w>
world's </w> deserts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-027#117:2>
This does not mean the creation of water-choked labyrinths of canals
but the preservation of the origional, natural habitats, with their own
plant and animal communities, and a rational use of the surrounding lands,
which are most susceptible to becoming the lifeless, desolate places we
all think deserts are. </p> <*> overlapping diamonds, red & black</*> </I>
