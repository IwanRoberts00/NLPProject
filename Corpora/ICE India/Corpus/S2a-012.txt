<ICE-IND:S2A-012#1:1:A>
This is the captain of the Haryana side <,,> and <,> trying to
<,,> get back into <,> the Indian team <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#2:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#3:1:A>
Gurdeep Singh <,,> Sanjeev Ram Saran on the <,,> crossing there <,>
and uh <,,> empire Sachin Navadia <,> who was this side of the team at the
moment <,,> is supervising the match with uh <,> T S Bullard <,> on the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#6:1:A>
Kishan Singh <,,> stop there by Shakira <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#7:1:A>
Jagbir <,,> obstruct it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#8:1:A>
Narendra number two Gurdeep Singh <,,> he has been <,,> playing very
well I am sure in this tournament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#9:1:A>
Sanjeev Kumar kicks there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#10:1:A>
Sanjay Bisht India player <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#11:1:A>
Gurdeep Singh <,,> and there is Mukesh Kumar playing there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#12:1:A>
Still in possession still got the ball in position <,> now Balbir
Sahani hold out for off time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#13:1:A>
A gentle stroke <?> Saki </?> who picked up that ball for Haryana
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#14:1:A>
Ashok Kumar <,,> stopped it <,,> Gurdeep Singh <,,> on Baljit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#15:1:A>
Baljit in possession <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#16:1:A>
Ball <,> given to him <,> by <,> Baljit Singh <,> off there <,> he
knew his position all over the <?> island </?> <,,> and now Indian Airline
trying to make headway <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#17:1:A>
A beaten there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#18:1:A>
Sanjay Bhatia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#19:1:A>
Haryana into move now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#20:1:A>
Baljit <,,> coming five men across <,,> the struck in the process
<,,> ball over the striker <,> but no chance Ram Saran <,> could not get a
strike <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#21:1:A>
Good to be the goal <,> the play <,> he eject at last <,> certain
bid of the touch <,> to uh <,> a straight ball <,> and we have a goal out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#22:1:A>
But Ram Saran missed <,> and <,> the first chance for Haryana <,>
has gone a waste

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#23:1:A>
Manoj Kumar <,,> very <?> ferocious </?> outside <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#24:1:A>
The ball is in possession <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#25:1:A>
A sure goal there for Mukesh Kumar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#26:1:A>
He will play final decision into the crossway <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#27:1:A>
Oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was <,,>
Gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh <,> Mukesh lost possession <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#28:1:A>
Anyway they have a corner <,,> ball hit <,,> and now let us see
what uh <,> uh this Ranjit Kumar can do <,,> but then <,,> Gundeep has come
back there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#29:1:A>
Ram Saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed <,,> and
kicks <,,> watch again Gundeep <,,> men who gets a drift <,,> put the ball at
far square <,> on that uh <,,> Sanjeev Kumar got a catch from good run get
hold of the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#30:1:A>
Amar Singh Negi that was <,,> who were outside from the ball from
there <,> and uh <,> play it for uh <,> Indian Airline

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#31:1:A>
Shakeel Ahmed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#32:1:A>
Down to Mukesh Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#33:1:A>
Mukesh moving well today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#34:1:A>
He had a practice tournament here <,,> Baljit <,,> Gundeep <,,> on
to the Ram Saran <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#35:1:A>
Ram Saran still in the lead ahead <,> couple of yards <,> but I am
sure he knows that he is not there in his own position <,> and <w> that's
</w> end of a ball flight

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#36:1:A>
So <,> another cross wasted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#37:1:A>
Harvinder <,,> Sanjay Bisht <,,> Rajpal to Mukesh Kumar but ball
<,> a little bit uh <,> shallow and it goes out before he had it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#38:1:A>
Final of this Federation Cup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#39:1:A>
The first five minutes did not produce uh <,,> yielding <,,>
unexpected <,,> but Haryan definitely having as much of the game <,> as
Indian Airlines

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#40:1:A>
Gundeep trying to make headway <,> and uh <,> fully that ball out
in the <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#41:1:A>
Ball deflected out to corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#42:1:A>
So in the first corner <,> Indian Airlines the Airlines have won
<,,> and now its turn <,> of Haryana and taking the corner hit <,,> is uh
<,,> Gundeep Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#43:1:A>
He goes to a former <,> India player <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#44:1:A>
Gundeep <,> and they all charging here and deflected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#45:1:A>
Gundeep Kumar <,,> stop there by Mohammad Arif <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#46:1:A>
Tries his scoop doesn't do it well <,> and touch the <,> penalty
corner in a good way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#47:1:A>
Baljit Singh is going to take the <,> push <,,> and is going to be
<,,> well <,,> Gurdeep Singh <,,> for the hit <,,> also near him Ram Saran
<,,> Mukesh Kumar <,> and uh <,,> <w> that's </w> it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#48:1:A>
And what a lovely shot there <,> is a good short there <,,> tries
to the corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#49:1:A>
But got <,,> to face the <O> one word </O> Gundeep Kumar try to
make a big hit <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#50:1:A>
He was to make well <,,> but misfield but tries well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#51:1:A>
Second penalty corner on to a real big shot <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#52:1:A>
The Haryana boys are <,> putting the pressure <,> over Indian
Airlines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#53:1:A>
Another penalty corner <,,> second corner now <,,> <O> two words
</O> Baljit Kumar <,,> Baljit Kumar who played one play <,> ball is out there
<,> he always have to play around Sanjay Bisht <,,> <O> one word </O> teaming
up with Sanjay Bisht <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#54:1:A>
He is a bit of trying hard and driving <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#55:1:A>
It is secure there <,> by Kishan Singh <,> and given on to <,>
Gundeep <,> and over to Daljit <,> <w> it's </w> over to Sukumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#56:1:A>
<?> Saran </?> Kumar <,> has given up there uh moving this uh <,>
defence why middle of exchange of will serve

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#57:1:A>
And thinking of strucking by <,> and empire Sachin Navadia serving
the call to penalty corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#58:1:A>
<w> That's </w> Daljit <,,> taking <,,> collecting by Kuldeep side
<,> in time <,> ball deflected out <,> corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#59:1:A>
Here penalty corner kick <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#60:1:A>
He did it for <O> two words </O> but went for the straight shot
<,,> but uh <,,> the ball was deflected there by <,> goalkeeper <w>
Subbaiah's </w> stick <,,> and <,> in corner now Sanjay Bisht in possession
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#61:1:A>
Now that is uh <,,> Negi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#62:1:A>
A misfield for Haryana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#63:1:A>
Haryana definetly doing <,,> most of the attacking in this first
half <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#64:1:A>
And uh <,> considering that they are <,> the under dogs for this
final <,> is certainly well good cheer up to what Jagbir does now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#65:1:A>
And <,> crossing there and uh <,> again got the chance lost <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#66:1:A>
I mean the score still one <,> as it here appears over to Kuku
Wadia

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#67:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#68:1:A>
For our viewers <,,> now we have that man here <,> Mr K P S
<,,> Gill

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#69:1:A>
You have been watching Mr Gill <,> the <,> matches in this
Federation Cup practically everyday <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#70:1:A>
Did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#71:1:C>
Uh <,,> most of the players uh who were there in the camp <,,>
uh are <,,> again been asked <,> to join the camp and <w> we've </w> found
about seven <,> new faces here <,> who will be <,> asked to <,,> come into
the camp <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#72:1:C>
But watching Haryana <,,> <w> I've </w> been very impressed with
their play <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#73:1:A>
Yes specially Sanjeev Kumar is doing <,> exceptionally well
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#74:1:C>
Yes <,> uh and I want to <,,> have a <,,> separate look at
Haryana altogether

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#75:1:C>
I want to see <,> how they impress <,> so with such team <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#76:1:C>
And they have been really been playing together <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#77:1:A>
And I believe you have <,,> and the half the team from Punjab
<,> and half the team from Haryana <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#78:1:C>
Uh there are players from Punjab Sindh Bank there are players
from B S F <,,> uh but basically <w> it's </w> uh <,,> <w> it's </w> not of
<,> team which has played together for a long team

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#79:1:A>
Yes <,> they have impressed considerably <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#80:1:A>
Now what do you think uh <,,> should be done as far as uh <,,> if
you go round the whole Jalandhar you see the <,> boards <,> a revival of the
Indian hockey being planned <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#81:1:A>
Now what you are going about <,> doing that <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#82:1:C>
You see uh <,,> at the moment uh <,,> certain planning has
gone in <,,> as far as <,> Asian Games are concerned and <,> thereafter the
World Cup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#83:1:C>
But I will be looking after the <,,> uh Champions Trophy and the
Olympic Games <,,> ninety-five and ninety-six <,,> and uh <,> then after that
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#84:1:C>
And the objective will be to win these two <,,> tournaments <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#85:1:A>
So far as the Asian Games is concerned <,> uh <w> it's </w>
obvious the time is very short <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#86:1:A>
Now but do you have any <,,> graded procedures to <,> raise the
standard of hockey in India <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#87:1:C>
Uh <,,> for these <,> two tournaments <,> which <,,> are <,>
coming up <,> immediately <,,> there is nothing much we can add on to what
has been happening <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#88:1:C>
But for the <,> tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six
<,,> we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year
<,,> pick up a large number of good players <,,> and trained them at
different places <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#89:1:C>
And then try to see that there is an overall <,,> uhm raising of
the standard <,,> so that when we <,,> go into the <,> Champions Trophy <,>
and subsequently the Olympic <,> uh uh <w> we're </w> going as a combination
which is feared all over the world <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#90:1:A>
Now you have about forty odd boys <,,> in the camp at
Chandigarh <,,> juniors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#91:1:A>
Now what you are going to do about them <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#92:1:C>
Those are the boys <w> who've </w> been selected uh <,> from
various camps which were held in country <,,> including some boys from the
<,,> Academy <,> Airlines Academy and uh <,,> in Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#93:1:C>
Now <,,> we are <,> trying to constituent a team because we have
been invited for <,,> juniors <,> double games <,> in Australia and Spain <,>
and in Germany <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#94:1:C>
The idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#95:1:C>
And then watch for these players show <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#96:1:A>
May you also have a long term life <,> as concerning <,>
youngsters in the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#97:1:A>
What you want to do about them <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#98:1:C>
You see <,> <w> I've </w> been talking to people uh <,> <w>
who've </w> uh <,,> been associated with hockey <,,> and I find <,> that one
of the recommendations is that we should trust in young <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#99:1:C>
So by <,,> winter of this year <,,> November <,,> we shall be
launching a talent search <,> all over the country for the age group ten to
fourteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#100:1:C>
And we will try to <,> get these players into <,,> uh centre where
astro-turf is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#101:1:C>
So that they can start playing on astro-turf <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#102:1:C>
And uh also <,> they will be given <,,> uh <,,> all sort of uh
fitness uh <,,> programme <,,> over the next <,> few years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#103:1:C>
So that uh <,> they build up strength they build up stamina and
build up speed <,,> and simultaneously the hockey skills adopted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#104:1:C>
In addition to that uh <,,> thereafter from next year onwards <,>
we will keep on adding on <,,> by <,,> having a look at the boys ten years
old <,,> and selecting them <,> to keep on to <,,> uh enter this <,,> uh
stream

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#105:1:C>
So that we always have good players whenever you ask <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#106:1:A>
Anyway <,> <w> let's </w> hope <,> your leadership Mr Gill
<,> will uh <,> bring the revival of the Indian hockey <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#107:1:A>
Thank you very much

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#108:1:C>
Thank you <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-012#109:1:A>
Okay <w> let's </w> come down here at the Burlton Park
stadium <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#110:1:A>
And the pace in the game has slowed down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#111:1:A>
Also then Indian <}> <-> <.> Air </.> </-> <=> Airlines </=> </}>
are having a <}> <-> <.> diffi </.> </-> <=> difficult </=> </}> time <,>
containing this Haryana force <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#112:1:A>
Though they have nothing to fear <,,> <w> they'll </w> be making
the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill
now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#113:1:A>
So far as <,> Airline had three good chances very well done I mean
strike <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#114:1:A>
In fact <w> that's </w> Haryana it can goal

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#115:1:A>
He must be having to chose between and uh <,> <w> that's </w> the
ultimately it goes to <,> the penalty corner decision <,> and Mohammed Arif
has always been scoring for the Indian Airlines <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#116:1:A>
One penalty corner but he didn't do it to get

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#117:1:A>
And Haryana on to down this

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#118:1:A>
There is this new break in Haryana team

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#119:1:A>
Now after this kick <,> for Indian Airlines

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#120:1:A>
Good throw ball there <,,> for Rajinder Singh but Baljit Singh
takes ball there <,> and comes out in the clear still in possession <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#121:1:A>
Miracle there <,> by <,,> Sanjay Bhatia and <,> put it through
<,,> Sanjeev and uh <?> Kurian </?> <,> Indian Airlines but <w> that's </w>
true there is a lot of doing <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#122:1:A>
Sanjeev Bhatia <,,> trying to make headway down the left flank
<,,> not successful <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#123:1:A>
Free hit to be taken now by Gurdeep Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#124:1:A>
Now the the frail Haryana push back <,> and <,> Tandon given
service in this competition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#125:1:A>
Every match practically he has played very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#126:1:A>
Baljit <,,> Gundeep Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#127:1:A>
<?> Haryana side </?> in possession <?> Harinder </?> gets it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#128:1:A>
And lose it <,> call after to Bhutia <,,> and back to Harinder
<,,> and on to Mohammed Arif <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#129:1:A>
Arif is the India pull back <,,> who has been on the India team
<,> over the last four tournaments <,> abroad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#130:1:A>
And <w> let's </w> see what Shakeel Ahmed <,> the captain <,,> of
India <,,> do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#131:1:A>
It was a good throw there by Jagbir <,,> but uh it was twist there
by Kishan Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#132:1:A>
And a free hit for <,> Indian Airlines just outside <,> the
penalty corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#133:1:A>
Shakeel Ahmed <,,> back to Sanjay Bisht <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#134:1:A>
Getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#135:1:A>
That is as I talk <,> a little shower we had <,> <w> it's </w> the
<O> one word </O> now at the moment <,,> but uh towards uh this uh <,> <O>
one word </O> in this <O> two words </O> <,> on this to put up pace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#136:1:A>
Pick the ball now Sanjeev Kumar for Haryana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#137:1:A>
The ball there <,> by <,> Harvinder <,> of course he may <&>
recording broken </&> and Sanjeev takes it to the end <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#138:1:A>
It was through the drive reflection that was <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#139:1:A>
Harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side Gundeep Kumar <,> on
the other side <,,> Jagbir Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#140:1:A>
Both have been missing constantly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#141:1:A>
They drop the best chance anybody could have asked for <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#142:1:A>
But the one that Gundeep Kumar <,> had in the first half <,> when
uh <,,> Sanjeev Kumar put him through <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#143:1:A>
When he made <?> unstopper </?> to chance <,> and Haryana are
still fighting <,,> to get the ball <,> uptill now <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#144:1:A>
Indian Airlines on the attack now <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#145:1:A>
Ajay Singh in possession <,,> say in twist breath <,> first Rawat
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#146:1:A>
Gundeep Kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the
back over there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#147:1:A>
<?> Bhishan </?> had good match today <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#148:1:A>
Trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was
brought down by that water there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#149:1:A>
Even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush <,> but here is
water <,,> and <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#150:1:A>
And foul there <,> uh by <,> Sanjay Bisht <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#151:1:A>
And Sanjeev Kumar trying to make headway <,> and uh <,> driving
first Shakeel Ahmed who has gone down on the ground there <,> and he was
trying to push him through there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#152:1:A>
And uh <,> inadvertently Sanjeev Kumar stick went into his stomach
now look at it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#153:1:A>
It was not an intentional foul <,,> but uh <,> Shakeel went down
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#154:1:A>
And he is getting medical attention <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#155:1:A>
We are seeing the man with the T-shirt <,> and uh <,> the white
T-shirt and the red cap <,,> he was the former captain of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#156:1:A>
Have won and the final penalty corner hit as <,> in the game and
coming behind there <,> is Subbaiah <,,> being played and was <,> was played
by India on numerous occasion <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#157:1:A>
And uh <,> with the absence of Ashish Ballal <,> who has hurt his
knee <,,> in camp <,,> Subbaiah has been functioning <,,> all through <,,> uh
I mean all matches <,,> here <,> while uh if Ballal was there he would not
have been here <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#158:1:A>
So anyway <w> it's </w> why he doesn't to the occasion <,> and he
has functioned <,> very well indeed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#159:1:A>
Against Bombay he brought out on that lovely chase <,> and again
today <,> he is pitied against in fact <,> the reasons are behind Gundeep
Kumar not <,> making uh <,> sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if
he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat
Subbaiah <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#160:1:A>
So Subbaiah is <,> is slogging with <?> jats </?> <w> that's </w>
frustrating the Haryana forwards <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#161:1:A>
Though one must say that uh <,,> Gundeep Kumar and then Baljit
would have the chance to score <,> but they did not make <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#162:1:A>
Now later half begin <,,>

dangerous play <,> free hit for Haryana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#168:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-012#169:1:A>
Ram Saran still holding up the ball <,,>

He is looking out for a hit <,> somebody in the clear <,,> does
round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him <w> it's </w> <O>
