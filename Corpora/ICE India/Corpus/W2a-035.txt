Metallurgical industry has grown to be a major contributor to
environmental pollution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#5:1>
Emissions from an aluminium smelter located in India were monitored to
study the pollution problems created by the refining and smelting
processes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#6:1>
<mention> <w> Bayer's </w> process for alumina production and
Hall-Heroult process </mention> for smelting are in use in the plant
selected for study.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#7:1>
Keeping in view the manufacturing processes and various other
factors, <mention> SPM, SO<sb>2</sb>, NO<sb>x</sb> and fluorides </mention>
were selected as significant parameters for monitoring to establish the
work zone air quality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#8:1>
Based on the strength and location of fugitive emission sources and
meteorological parameters, 22 sampling stations were monitored within the
complex. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#9:1>
The observations suggest need for better technology in the
production of aluminium so as to minimize pollutant generation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#10:1>
In addition, use of pollution control measures, like <mention> ESPs
</mention> and <mention> scrubbers </mention> and their proper maintenance
and regular monitoring of air quality within the plant are required. </p>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#12:1>
Metallurgical industrial activity is one of the most important
examples of human ability to process, form, shape, treat and use various
natural resources.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#13:1>
Increase in metallurgical industrial activities in the past few
decades has no doubt ensured economic development but certainly at the
risk of environmental pollution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#14:1>
India has very large reserves of bauxite ore and aluminium industry
is known to be one of the major polluting industries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#15:1>
Continous disposal of wastes creates a problem where nature no longer
is able to disperse, absorb or dispose off unwanted residues in the natural
sinks of the environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#16:1>
This demands provision and efficient use of pollution control
measures to minimise the adverse environmental impacts due to emissions
from various unit opertions of aluminium industry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#17:1>
A number of processes are involved in the conversion of bauxite to
finish aluminium.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#18:1>
The major pollutants from any aluminium smelter include <mention>
gaseous emissions </mention> , <mention> solid wastes </mention> , <mention>
liquid effluents </mention> , <mention> dust </mention> , etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#19:1>
The molten cryolite bath used in smelting process has
considerable vapour pressure thereby resulting in formation of aerosols which
are partially hydrolysed to hydrogen fluoride.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#20:1>
Particulate fluorides are also present in aerosols.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#21:1>
<mention> Suspended particulate matter </mention> ( SPM) is
another major pollutant observed to be present within the plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#22:1>
SO<sb>2</sb> is also formed due to the oxidation of sulphur from the
anode coke.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#23:1>
Once fluorides are discharged into the atmosphere, their dispersal
and continued suspension in or loss from atmosphere are influenced not only
by meteorological conditions but also by their interaction with water
vapour in the atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#24:1>
Effect of airborne fluorides on man, such as crippling fluorisis
has been observed to result from long term exposures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#25:1>
The ingestion of fluoride by animals is likely to cause different
types of specific lesions, lameness and appetite impairment resulting in
decreased weight gain or diminished milk yield.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#26:1>
Accumultation of fluorides in plants can cause changes in
metabolism, production of foliar lesions and alteration in growth,
development and yield. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#27:1>
Studies were carried out in an integrated aluminium complex with
production capacity of 0.1 million tonne of aluminium and fabricated
products per annum.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#28:1>
The various units in the plant include <mention> smelter </mention> ,
<mention> alloy foundry </mention> , <mention> rolling mills </mention> and
<mention> carbon plant </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#29:1>
In this paper, an attempt has been made to describe the approach to
the problem along with the observations and suggested mitigative measures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#30:1>
<h> <bold> PROCESS DETAILS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#31:1>
<mention> <w> Bayer's </w> process </mention> has been adopted by
the industry for the production of refined alumina.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#32:1>
The process involves crushing and grinding of the ore which is then
made into a slurry by adding caustic soda; desilication followed by
digestion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#33:1>
The alumina liquor obtained is filtered, precipitated and calcined to
get alumina powder.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#34:1>
<mention> Hall Heroult process </mention> is used for <O> <&> page
</&> 561 </O> <O> table </O> <O> caption </O> conversion of alumina to
aluminium.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#35:1>
Vertical study Soderberg electrolytic cells are used for
electrolysis/smelting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#36:1>
As part of air quality monitoring programme, <mention> SPM
</mention> , SO<sb>2</sb>, NO<sb>2</sb> and total fluorides were monitored
inside the aluminium complex keeping in view the manufacturing process and
compliance parameters to identify sampling stations for work zone monitoring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#37:1>
After assessing the possible sources of pollutant emissions,
following units were selected for monitoring : ( a) <mention> Smelter
</mention> , ( b) <mention> G. M. smelter </mention> , ( c) <mention>
Administrative building </mention> , ( d) <mention> Silos </mention> , ( e)

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#38:1>
The objective of air quality monitoring was multifold, and,
therefore, number and height of monitoring stations at aforereferred sites
were varied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#39:1>
In cell hours 8 parallel rows of cells are present.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#40:1>
Fluoride is the major pollutant generated during cell house
operations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#41:1>
Air quality monitoring in cell house was carried out to determine
fugitive emission rates of SO<sb>2</sb>, NO<sb>2</sb>, SPM in general and
fluoride in particular.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#42:1>
Air quality moniotring was carried out on either side of smelters at
1.2 m height and 6 m away from smelters, <O> <&> page </&> 562 </O> <O>
figure 1, 2 & 3 </O> <O> captions </O> and some sampling stations were kept
at 6 m, height near roof level.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#43:1>
The detaile of air quality monitoring stations are depicted in
figure 1. <mention> SPM </mention> was observed to be the major pollutant
at <mention> silos </mention> , <mention> coal handling area </mention> ,
<mention> lime storage and handling area </mention> , <mention> caustic
storage and handling area </mention> , <mention> ball mill </mention> ,
<mention> bauxite yard </mention> and <mention> tippler site </mention> and
<mention> air monitoring at G.M. smelter building </mention> , <mention>
administrative building </mention> and <mention> engineering building
</mention> was carried out to determine air quality inside the plant
premises. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#44:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIAL AND METHOD </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#45:1>
Samples were analysed for total suspended matter, SO<sb>2</sb>,
NO<sb>x</sb> and fluorides, Sampling was carried out at intervals of 4 hr for
a period of 24 hr at each site and the samples were analysed immediately.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#46:1>

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#47:1>
The flow rate was maintained between 1-1. 2 m<sp>2</sp>/min.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#48:1>
Gravimetric method was used for estimation of <mention> SPM
</mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#49:1>
The gases were collected by wet impingement method using midget
impingers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#50:1>
<mention> West and Gaeke </mention> method was used for the analysis
of sulphur dioxide, 0.1 M sodium tetrachloromercurate was kept in the
impinger as the absorbing reagent and the gas was sucked into it at the rate
of 1 lpm.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#51:1>
The red-purple coloured para-rosaniline methyl sulphonic acid was
measured at 560 nm. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 564 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#52:1>
Nitrogn oxides were measured using the method suggested by
Jacobs and Hochheiser.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#53:1>
0.1 M sodium hydroxide was used as the absorbing medium.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#54:1>
The coloured complex formed was measured at 540 nm.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#55:1>
Total fluoride was analysed by adsorbing the air in 0.1 M sodium
hydroxide solution at a flow rate of 0.8 lpm.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#56:1>
The pore diameter of the impinger was 1 mm.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#57:1>
Fluoride and hydrogen fluoride were measured in the alkaline solution
using Orion model 407 A pH / mv meter with fluoride selective electrode (
Orion 94. 09 ) and single junction reference electrode ( Orion 90-91 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#58:1>
<mention> TISAB <roman> 3 </roman> </mention> was used as the buffer
and the complexing reagent to remove any interfering ions present.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#59:1>
Analysis of particulate fluorides was carried out by extracting
water soluble particulate matter collected on filter paper after weighing
the <mention> SPM </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#60:1>
Further analysis was similar to that of total fluoride.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#61:1>
Determination was carried out in the blank simultanously to assess
the possible presence of any fluoride in GF/ A paper. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#62:1>
<h> <bold> RESULT AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#63:1>
The sampling sites were selected to study the air quality in the
work environment of an aluminium plant, the various pollutants present and
the sources.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#64:1>
Taking into account the production activities of the complex,
<mention> SPM </mention> , NO<sb>x</sb>, SO<sb>2</sb> and fluorides were
identified as significant pollutants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#65:1>
Smelter is the main source of pollution in the aluminium plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#66:1>
Cryolite, which is used in the cell at a temperatures of 900 <*>
degrees</*>C and above is the primary source of fluoride in the workzone
atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#67:1>
Ruptures in the electrolytic cell may lead to the escape of HF and
particulate fluorides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#68:1>
Coke is used in the anode which might be a source of SO<sb>2</sb> and
NO<sb>x</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#69:1>
Dust is another pollutant in the cell house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#70:1>
<mention> Alumina powder </mention> , <mention> cryolite </mention> ,
and <mention> CaF<sb>2</sb> </mention> are fed to the cells.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#71:1>
These may escape into the air due to wind action and vehicular
movement, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#72:1>
Steam plant provided with 3 high pressure boilers and one low
pressure is the major source of SO<sb>2</sb> and dust emissions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#73:1>
The observed concentrations of various pollutants at the cell house
and work zone are reported in tables 1 and 2, respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#74:1>
Maximum average <mention> SPM </mention> concentration was
observed near the tippler because of the unloading operations of
bauxite ore from the railway wagons and transportation through conveyer belt.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#75:1>
The Ball Mill area also recorded high concentration of <mention> SPM
</mention> because of ore crushing and grinding operations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#76:1>
High dust concentration in the cell house is due to the use of
alumina and cryolite powder in the process.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#77:1>
A higher concentration has been observed at roof level than at ground
level of cell house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#78:1>
A minimum <mention> SPM </mention> concentration of 173 <*>
mu</*>g / m<sp>3</sp> ( average ) was observed in the G.M. smelter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#79:1>
The <mention> SPM </mention> concentration was found to vary at
different parts of the day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#80:1>
The concentration of <mention> SPM </mention> at the cell house was
found to vary at different locations and with time ( Figure 2 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#81:1>
The concentration of sulphur dioxide was observed to be higher in
the cell house area as compared to other locations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#82:1>
A maximum concentration of 457 <*> mu</*>g / m<sp>2</sp> was measured
near one of the cells.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#83:1>
SO<sb>2</sb> is produced due to the oxidation of sulphur in coke and
other fuels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#84:1>
A minimum concentration of 6 <*> mu</*>g / m<sp>3</sp> was
recorded in the Ball mill area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#85:1>
This sampling point was the farthest point from the smelter and,
therefore, recorded a very low SO<sb>2</sb> concentration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#86:1>
In the cell house, higher concentration was observed at roof
height than at ground level ( Figure 3 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#87:1>
The concentration showed considerable temporal and spatial
distribution and different concentration were recorded on either side of the
cell ( Figure 4 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#88:1>
Dxides of nitrogen, mainly nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are
the other pollutants also monitored within the plant premises.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#89:1>
Higher concentration of NO<sb>4</sb> was observed in the cell house,
as also in the coal handling area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#90:1>
Cell house is the primary source of fluoride in the workzone
atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#91:1>
It can be observed from table 1 and figure 5 that higher
concentrations of total and particulate fluorides are recorded in the cell
house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#92:1>
The concentration showed decreasing trend as the distance from
smelter increased.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#93:1>
The gaseous fluoride concentration in cell house varied in the
range of 43-1983 <*> mu</*>g / m<sp>3</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#94:1>
Fluoride concentrations were observed to be more in inner / rows
in comparison to those recorded near outer rows.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#95:1>
Higher concentrations wre observed at roof level air monitoring
stations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#96:1>
Fluoride concentration in suspended particulate matter extracted
from filter paper varied in the range of 42-820 <*> mu</*>g / m<sp>3</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#97:1>
At some of the monitoring stations, particulate fluoride
concentrations were observed to be higher than the gaseous fluoride
concentrations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#98:1>
The higher concentration of fluoride may be due to rupture in
electrolytic cells. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#99:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-035#100:1>
It was observed during the study that gaseous pollutants
escape into the atmosphere due to rupture in <O> <&> page </&> 565 </O>
electrolytic cells resdulting in very high concentration of gaseous and
particulate fluorides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#101:1>
In addition other pollutants were also observed to be emitted
from cell house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#102:1>
Average fluoride concentrations at other monitoring stations were
found to be comparatively less.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#103:1>
Interestingly, particulate fluoride concentrations were observed
to be comparatively less at monitoring stations other than the cell house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#104:1>
SPM concentrations recorded as high as 7771 <*> mu</*>g /
m<sp>3</sp> in lime area indicate higher source strength.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#105:1>
It was observed that the pollutant concentrations are very much less
at administration building, G.M. Smelter building and engineering building
as these monitoring stations were located far from air pollution sources
and the observations were taken on building roof tops.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#106:1>
These observations indicate need for efficient collection of gaseous
pollutants in fume hoods, use of precipiators and scrubing before
discharging into the atmosphere through stacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#107:1>
Both wet and dry scrubbing help in efficient fume control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-035#108:1>
Effective house keeping is essential to reduce the pollutant
concentration in the work area and above all it demands proper operation and
maintenance. </p> </I>
