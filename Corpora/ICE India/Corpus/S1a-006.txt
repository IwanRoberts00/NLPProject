<ICE-IND:S1A-006#1:1:A>
Mr Yadav I think we should discuss about Premchand and his <,>
workmanship regarding in the literature

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#2:1:A>
How do you think like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#3:1:B>
Yes what is your opinion <,> about Premchand say <,> art in
technique <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#4:1:A>
Premchand the greatest of <,> uh Hindi novelist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#5:1:A>
As far as his craftmanship is concerned I think he is the front rank
<,> front ranker <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#6:1:B>
Front ranker what do you mean by this front ranker <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#7:1:A>
Uh with the development of Hindi literature particularly in the
genre of <,,> novel I think <,> Premchand initiated <,> the novel form in its
presant context <,> and proper form <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#8:1:A>
So he should be considered as the front ranker <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#9:1:B>
Front ranker

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#10:1:A>
Front ranker <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#11:1:B>
Because by the word front ranker I do suppose that Premchand
initiated the novel form in its true contexts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#12:1:B>
It its exact form <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#13:1:B>
Then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story
and prose composition which can contain a large theme <,> in its full detail
charaterisation and everything else

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#14:1:B>
Premchand utilises novel form in the in this context <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#15:1:B>
So he should be considered as a front ranker <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#16:1:A>
I think Premchand <,,> is a novelist of <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#17:1:B>
<w> You're </w> <w> you're </w> considering about the quality
or the class of Premchand as a novelist <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#18:1:A>
No I just <,> uh want to emphasise this about Premchand <,> as
a novelist <,> particularly about his characters <{> <[> characters </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#19:1:B>
<[> Characters </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#20:1:A>
What kind of characters he put in his novel

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#21:1:B>
Oh yeah that is a very fine thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#22:1:B>
I think Premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related
to the rural life of India

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#23:1:B>
He is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the
villages in India particularly in the <,,> pre-Independence era and also <,>
about the Independence era <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#24:1:B>
Uh by this word pre-Independence I do mean <,> that <,> uh the
characters <,> which do occur in the novels of Premchand like <mention>
<indig> Godan </indig> </mention> <,> and some other novels like <mention>
<indig> Gaban </indig> </mention> <,> and <,,> <{1> <[1> say all these novels
</[1> there are lots of characters who just represent the different aspects
<,> different <,> uh see the different colours and different <,> categories
of the characters which are <,> which <,> uh are represented by our <{2> <[2>
rural society </[2> as well class

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#25:1:A>
<[1> I feel I feel </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#26:1:B>
<[2> I <O> one word </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#27:1:A>
I think <,> <w> Premchand's </w> characters are very simple

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#28:1:B>
Yeah no <{> <[> doubt </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#29:1:A>
<[> They </[> </{> are very innocent

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#30:1:B>
No doubt

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#31:1:A>
They come from low status of life <,> uh from villages <,,>
they are living standard is very low <,> <{> <[> yes <,> and <,,> they are
actually exploited <,> by the aristocrat classes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#32:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#33:1:A>
Because you see Premchand was a true <,> novelist in its sense

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#34:1:A>
He just painted rural pictures in its real serial colour without
any artificial ornamentation

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#35:1:A>
Premchand has represented rural society in its essence <,> true
essence <,> for example you see lots of farmers <,> while toiling hard and
and reeling under odd type of <,> atrocities and all type of <,,> I mean
exploitation at the hands of our feudal society and feudal bureaucratic set
up

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#36:1:A>
He has represented them all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#37:1:A>
Poverty is lying there all glaring poverty under the repressive
rules of taxes

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#38:1:A>
All type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set
up

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#39:1:A>
These are all glaring and all visible <,> clearly visible it is <{>
<[> I think so </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#40:1:B>
<[> I think his </[> </{> characters <,> are tragic <,> such
as uh <,> we can take for example <,,> in <mention> <indig> Gaban </indig>
</mention>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#41:1:A>
<mention> <indig> Gaban </indig> </mention> certainly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#42:1:B>
Uh Ramanath <,> <{1> <[1> he is </[1> a steady character <,>
though I think he is an escapist <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#43:1:B>
He leaves the hard realities of life he runs away <,> he <,> and he
<w> doesn't </w> show the <,> he <w> doesn't </w> <,> reveal the reality

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#44:1:A>
<[1> Ramanath </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#45:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#46:1:B>
He just <{> <[> manipulates something </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#47:1:A>
<[> I think in <quote> <indig> Gaban </indig> </quote> the
novel </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#48:1:B>
He does something but he says something

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#49:1:B>
So there is no unification in his <,> deed and speech

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#50:1:A>
I think uh the novel <quote> <indig> Gaban </indig> </quote>
which <,> uh shot up the popularity of Premchand as a novelist too much

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#51:1:A>
I think there is a <,,> psychological introspection into the
characters <O> one word </O> of Ramanath the character who has been affronted
by so many <,> pecularities of his fate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#52:1:A>
He is driven to Calcutta

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#53:1:A>
He goes there

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#54:1:A>
He <,> uh joins a very low middle class family there

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#55:1:A>
He one day goes <,> and wins a <,> a chess <,> uh quiz and he is
able to get some prize

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#56:1:A>
In his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to
his <,> uh jewelleries <{> <[> to his wife </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#57:1:B>
<[> Can you tell me </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#58:1:B>
Can you tell me please <,> how does he come to the real point

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#59:1:A>
Ramanath <,> Ramanath realises ultimately

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#60:1:B>
What does he realises ultimately

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#61:1:A>
Ramanath ultimately did realise that his fascination and his
over expense <,> <.> o </.> on the items of <,> uh high valued jewelleries
costly jewelleries <,> was not a real thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#62:1:A>
It did create <,> lot of problems for him he had leave his flee
away from his home town Lucknow and he was forced to go to Calcutta

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#63:1:A>
And there <,> amidst lots of tragic situations and grim realities
<,> he come to this conclusion that we cannot move <,> or flee away from the
hard realities which <,> uh are the pre-dominence realities of life and
society

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#64:1:A>
I think <,> something like that <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#65:1:B>
What do you think uh <,,> about his art and technique <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#66:1:A>
<w> Premchand's </w>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#67:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#68:1:A>
As <,> art technique Premchand has used the picturised
pictures card I think

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#69:1:A>
Premchand <{> <[> always </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#70:1:B>
<[> Pictures </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#71:1:A>
Uh <,> uh <,> by pictures I mean that Premchand always <,> uh
puts before his readers <,> or presents before his <,,> his readers of his
novels <,> a true and lively and faithful picture of the surrounding or the
locale he is going to put in his novel

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#72:1:A>
For example <,> if he tries to mention a village <,> then he starts
about <,> picturising all the minute details

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#73:1:A>
For example the roads <,> full of dust

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#74:1:A>
For example the pond full of hycinth and all even <,> men and women
are bathing there and even <,> cattles and animals are also there and
somebody is washing his utensils and somebody is washing his clothes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#75:1:B>
So this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy
and lively informatives he used to give <,> <{> <[> yes <,> regarding his
location

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#76:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#77:1:B>
<w> You're </w> </[> </{> <w> you're </w> <w> you're </w> very
correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#78:1:B>
His description is really very minute <,> and clear when we read

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#79:1:B>
And very live <,> lively

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#80:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> lively

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#81:1:B>
Yes but <,> what do you think about the language <,> which he
uses in his novels <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#82:1:A>
Uhm in terms of <.> lang </.> uh language I think Premchand
should be considered as a <,> true artist in the sense he never goes for
artificial or ornamental language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#83:1:A>
He always picks up the words from our local dialects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#84:1:A>
Or even the word <,> he use <,> suggest a kind of our naturality
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#85:1:A>
Suppose for example he always uses such type of dialogues which are
actually spoken by the native people <,> in the remote village side

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#86:1:A>
I <{> <[> think </[> like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#87:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#88:1:A>
And that gives a kind of naturality and directness to the
expression their livility and anything else

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#89:1:B>
Yes <,> you are very correct <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#90:1:B>
Really his languauage is very simple <,> direct <,> and very very
communicative <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#91:1:B>
Even <,> his language is so simple that it is not difficult to
understand <,,> even a very <,,> uneducated person also can be able to
understand and can able <,,> can be able to enjoy his novel

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#92:1:A>
One thing one <O> one word </O> I I do feel that <,,> the
language Premchand uses in his novels <,> do present such categories and such
classes in our society

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#93:1:A>
For example <,> for the people belonging to lowest strata of
society <,> Premchand uses the exact dialogue used by them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#94:1:B>
Yes <{> <[> very good very correct </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#95:1:A>
<[> And for example </[> </{> <,> people belonging to suppose
suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the <,> uh or the upper
class elite class gentry <,> he uses that type of <,> uh I mean the standard
dialect <,> which has some real touches and everything etiquette and manner
all things that are possible

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#96:1:A>
For example <,> a feudal chief a <indig> zamindar </indig> talking
to his <,> uh kinsmen and talking to his uh <,> I mean servants <,> he uses
there is a kind of <,> two kinds of uh language there

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#97:1:A>
The language used by the <indig> zamindar </indig> or the feudal
chief is something <,> high something bombastic something <O> one word </O>
and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something
quitely different and there you come across a kind of representation of the
society in terms of the variation of the language itself

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#98:1:A>
I think it is also a peculiar aspect

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#99:1:A>
A a distinct achievement of Premchand as <,> a craftmanship
regarding his novels being in the terms of use of languages of <,> <{1> <[1>
uhm <,> do you think like that <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#100:1:A>
Alright is it okay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#101:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#102:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#103:1:B>
Now I would like to <,> discuss about <,> uh uh <,>
Premchands <,> pictorial <,,> uses of language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#104:1:B>
He uses pictorial languages also

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#105:1:B>
He <,,> is <,,> his language is <,> poetic very poetic <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#106:1:A>
Yes it is <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#107:1:B>
So <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#108:1:A>
<[> <w> I'll </w> </[> </{> show you some examples <{> <[> Mr
Yadav </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#109:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#110:1:A>
For Premchand makes fine or rather <,,> far fetched use of
<,> miseries and phrases

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#111:1:A>
Phrases to communicate <,> uh great ideas

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#112:1:A>
Very direct ideas for example <,> uh in a beautiful short story
<mention> <indig> Kafan <,,> Kafan </indig> </mention> dealing with the <,>
tragic aspects of the <.> li </.> lives of <,> a father and his son <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#113:1:A>
Premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#114:1:A>
How due to her pregnancy

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#115:1:A>
And both son and father <,> father-in-law <,> both are so lazy
that they have just <,> <w> didn't </w> care

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#116:1:A>
They <w> didn't </w> care <,> to their daughter-in-law and she is
dying

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#117:1:A>
And which Premchand has shown in this way <,> that <,,> uh while
the daughter-in-law <,> is just on her on her death-bed <,> crying up
mercilesly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#118:1:A>
And at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep
slumber as if two <indig> azgars </indig> are sleeping <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#119:1:A>
So there the tongue two <indig> azgars </indig> do indicates such
a kind of pictorial touch <,> and there lies the brilliance of <,> use of
language in its pictorial manifestation

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#120:1:A>
I <{> <[> think </[> something like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#121:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#122:1:B>
Yes correct

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#123:1:A>
And you come across uh <,> so many I mean <,,> numberless
examination of such things

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#124:1:A>
And pictorial aspect has been <,> superbly illustrated by
Premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#125:1:A>
For example <,> you see in <mention> <indig> Panch Parmeshwar
</indig> </mention> also there is <,> brilliant example of this pictorial

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#126:1:A>
A representation and picturisation of <,> uh <indig> khala
</indig> and <indig> mausi </indig> for <?> <w> human's sake </w> </?>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#127:1:A>
There is also <,> uh her curly and white hairs and her cheeks <,>
uh swollen something like that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#128:1:B>
Yes <w> that's </w> true

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#129:1:A>
Here you also come across some picturisation aspect

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#130:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> true

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#131:1:B>
His <,> his ideas are also very thoughtful

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#132:1:B>
<{1> <[1> If it is </[1> deep idea <{2> <[2> so </[2> simple
language <,> in a very simple <{3> <[3> say </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#133:1:A>
<[1> Yes no no doubt </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#134:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#135:1:A>
<[3> For </[3> </{3> example you come across uh <,> so many
examples Premchands <,,> original views on poverty <,> honesty friendship <,>
these are the ideas <,> <w> India's </w> age old tradition

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#136:1:A>
In India the age old views on friendship trust cooperation
friendship all aspects have been <,> <{> <[> yes <,> dealt by Premchand in
different context and situations <,> and that <,> and those expressions
enable Premchand <,> to outlet and vent his ideas in a very just stable and
very convincing manner

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#137:1:A>
I think so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#138:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#139:1:B>
You are very correct

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#140:1:B>
Now I would like to talk about his satirical aspect <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#141:1:B>
I think Premchand is a great satirist <{> <[> because </[> he
exposes some foibles shortcomings weaknesses <,,> of the society <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#142:1:A>
<[> Because </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#143:1:B>
So <,,> for example you see <,> in <mention> <indig> Gaban
</indig> </mention>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#144:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#145:1:B>
He exposes all the short comings of the society

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#146:1:B>
All the happening <,> a real happening of the society

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#147:1:A>
Yes <,> satire as uh the <{> <[> great satirist </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#148:1:B>
<[> He is a </[> </{> great satirist

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#149:1:A>
Yes yes

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#150:1:A>
Satire as a great satirist and classical John Ryder has said
<quote> satire as the amendment of vices by correction </quote>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-006#151:1:B>
I think Premchand also <,> in his <,> uh all through his
literary career followed this dictum <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#152:1:B>
<w> Premchand's </w> satirical purpose in his novels or short
stories wants to recorrect society <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#153:1:B>
To recorrect it <,> if there are certain anomalies in society <,>
there are some waywardness in society there are some inherent defect <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#154:1:B>
So Premchand used his aesthetic features of literary <,> literary
art to expose those irregularities which are prevelent in our society <,> and
by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware <,>
towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#155:1:B>
So that our society be such a place that we would like to be
living <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#156:1:B>
I think so

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#157:1:B>
Premchand has always attacked <,> on the exact causes of our
poverty <,> exact causes of our illiteracy <,> exact causes of of unawareness
regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face
these days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#158:1:B>
Particularly one must remember that Premchand was writing <,> uh
uh uh Premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the
pre-Independence era when India was not free and it was under the clutches of
British monarchy

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#159:1:B>
All type of oppression <,> were being carried on <,> in the name
of British Queen after a <.> pro </.> proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#160:1:B>
So Premchand being a <O> one word </O> artist was always awake <,>
to see <,> what <,> our society is

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#161:1:B>
What are its chief defects

<ICE-IND:S1A-006#162:1:B>
And he always used the literary art <,> to work as a <.> st </.>
as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and
subconscious state <,> to see the gruelling aspect of society </I>
