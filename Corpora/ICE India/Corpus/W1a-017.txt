residences.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#4:1>
They give us painful & itching bites due to which all of us <del>
take </del> hate them <del> as </del> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#5:1>
Mosquitoes belong to the order diptera & sub-order nematocera.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#6:1>
Mosquitoes are distributed worldwide & they are found <}> <-> abundant
</-> <+> abundantly </+> </}> in tropics.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#7:1>
Mosquitoes are <-> in </-> plenty near marsh areas & near water
resources. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#8:1>
<h> <ul> Identification </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#9:1>
Mosquitoes are tiny, fragile insects with a pair of wings.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#10:1>
The second pair is reduced to halters.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#11:1>
The body is covered with bristles or hairs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#12:1>
Antennae are plumose, the wings may be transparent or spotted.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#13:1>
They show piercing and sucking mouth parts with sharp stylets.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#14:1>
Body is elongated with narrow abdomen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#15:1>
Larvae are comma shaped with a large head & thorax.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#16:1>
They respire with siphon being aquatic remain under water near
aquatic plants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#17:1>
They are saprophagous. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#18:1>
<h> <ul> Life history </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#19:1>
Female <}> <-> mosquito </-> <+> mosquitoes </+> </}> lay eggs
near the water body i.e. aquatic plants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#20:1>
They may <}> <-> be laid </-> <+> lay </+> </}> singly or in clusters
as in the genus <ul> Anopholes </ul> eggs <}> <-> are laid </-> <+> lay </+>
</}> singly & <-> are laid </-> in clusters in <ul> Aedes </ul> & <ul> Culex
</ul> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#21:1>
Eggs are elongated boat shaped.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#22:1>
Eggs hatch in 2 to 3 days into larvae.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#23:1>
Larvae are active and swim<del>s</del> by wriggling movements.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#24:1>
Therefore, the larvae are called wrigglers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#25:1>
The larvae moult 4 to 5 times in 15 to 20 days.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#26:1>
The pupa is exarate type, adult emerges in a week.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#27:1>
The adult is <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> active flier.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#28:1>
A female lays 840 eggs in her life span.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#29:1>
There are several generations a year. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#30:1>
<h> <ul> Damage </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#31:1>
The mosquitoes give painful bites & itching lesions which causes
irritation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#32:1>
The mosquitoes act as vectors for different diseases.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#33:1>
There are three main <del> of </del> genus which act as vectors - -
a) <ul> Anopheles </ul> sps b) <ul> Aedes </ul> sps c) <ul> Culex </ul> sps
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#34:1>
<h> a) <ul> Anopheles </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#35:1>
These are small creatures with piercing & sucking mouth parts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#36:1>
The males are harmless as they feed on nectar, but the females are
blood suckers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#37:1>
The females give irritating lesions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#38:1>
They act as vector for diseases like <mention> malaria, 3 day fever,
dengue fever, yellow fever </mention> etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#39:1>
The mosquito makes an angle with the substratum at rest.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#40:1>
The larvae of <ul> Anopheles </ul> cling to the water surface from
below by making <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> angle with it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#41:1>
Wings are clear & transparent with no spots.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#42:1>
Eggs <}> <-> are laid </-> <+> lay </+> </}> singly in this genus.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#43:1>
<h> b) <ul> Aedes </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#44:1>
<ul> Aedes </ul> is a small mosquito which is also called as
<quote> ` tiger' </quote> mosquito due to its striped abdomen and spotted
wings.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#45:1>
<mention> Aedes </mention> is also a blood sucker similar to the
Anopheles mosquito.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#46:1>
The <ul> Aedes </ul> acts as a carrier for the transmission of
diseases like dengue fever, yellow fever, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#47:1>
<ul> Aedes </ul> shows spotted wings & stripped abdomen, it does
not make <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> angle with the substratum while at
rest & is parallel to the surface.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#48:1>
The female <}> <-> deposts </-> <+> deposits </+> </}> eggs in

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#69:1>
The mosquitoes are of medical importance as they act as vectors
for the transmission of different diseases.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#70:1>
The different genus like <ul> Aedes </ul> , <ul> Culex </ul> and <ul>
Anopheles </ul> give painful bites & itching lesions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#71:1>
They transmit diseases like <mention> dengue fever, </mention>

<h> <ul> Biological Control </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#74:2>
The nature keeps a check on the population<del>s</del> existing
in nature by biotic as well as abiotic means due to which there remains a
balance in the different populations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#75:2>
Such a method by using the natural means to keep a check on other
organisms is called as <mention> <ul> biological control </ul> </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#76:2>
<mention> Biological control </mention> is a natural process which
goes on <}> <-> dialy </-> <+> daily </+> </}> but sometimes due to some or
the other reasons there is <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> out break of
certain individuals which are harmful for the human <}> <-> belongings </->
<+> beings </+> </}> & when the cause damages 5 % above the level of
economical damage they are regarded as pest & for the control of such
individuals the biological control is used.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#77:2>
Biological control can be done by various methods - - by employing
the preda--for-prey relationship, parasitoids, parasites, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#78:2>
( 1) <ul> Predation </ul> is one of the important tools of the
biological control.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#79:2>
The predaceous individuals feed upon the pest species & bring
their <}> <-> number </-> <+> numbers </+> </}> below the level of economical
damage.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#80:2>
These may belong to various classes in the animal kingdom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#81:2>
Among vertebrates birds are the enemies of the insects, they
control their population to a large extent.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#82:2>
Then there are reptiles, <del> ap </del> amphibians & fishes which
feed on the insects & bring their number to a low level. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#83:2>
Among invertebrates, there are various insect orders which are
predaceous which are listed as follows - -

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#95:2>
There are many more predaceous insects which act as biocontrol
agents & bring the pest population to a low level. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#96:2>
<h> ( 2) <ul> Parasitoids </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#97:2>
These are the creatures which parasitise the body of other pest
individual & lay their eggs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#98:2>
These eggs develop in the body and they emerge out by killing the
individual.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#99:2>
These are called as <mention> parasitoids </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#100:2>
There are two main orders which parasitise individuals which are - -
a) Hymenoptera b) Diptera </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#101:2>
<h> a) Hymenoptera - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#102:2>
It is a big order & the individuals parasitise the individuals &
order coleoptera, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#103:2>
The main families of this order are the brachonids, ichneumonids and
the chalcids.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#104:2>
The brachonids are small with dull colouration, wings are without
2nd recurrent vein & they are larval penasitoids.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#105:2>
The ichneumondids are shiny creatures with transparent wings & 2nd
recurrent vein is absent.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#106:2>
The chalcids are tiny insects with broad coxae & reduced <del> venal

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#116:2>
The biological control involves many steps which are taken under
consideration for the increase in the number of predators & parasitoids.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#117:2>
They <del> incul </del> include - -

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#118:2>
<del> a </del> The mass rearing of economically important
individuals & their release.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#119:2>
The predators <del> b) </del> are increased in the locality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#120:2>
<mention> Biological control </mention> is the safest of all the
control measures as it does not have any side effects.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#121:2>
It is a complete solution for a problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#122:2>
It is a slow process but a sure process.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#123:2>
It does not have any ill effects on the surroundings such as
pollution or residual effects etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#124:2>
It has no effect on the non-target species & it is one of the
advanced techniques which <del> will </del> is going to be <del> re </del>
used by removing other means of control. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-017#125:2>
<mention> Biological control </mention> started with the control
of scale insect on the citrus fruit in California & it was employed a
biocontrol method by bringing a predator of that scale <ul> ( Icerya
purchasi ) </ul> which was a lady bird beetle <ul> ( Rhodalla Cardinalis )
</ul> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-017#126:2>
