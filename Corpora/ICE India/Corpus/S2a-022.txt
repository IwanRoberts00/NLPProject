<ICE-IND:S2A-022#1:1:A>
This is the beginning of novels <,,> beginnings of novel in  
India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#2:1:A>
Now before I take up this uh <,> subject there is query from a  
colleague of ours <,> from Bombay <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#3:1:A>
She has uh <,,> she is willing to know as to where we can get  
material critical material <,> and creative writing <,> on Australian  
literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#4:1:A>
Because Australian literature as you know is quite new <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#5:1:A>
Uh from amongst uh <,> uh Commonwealth literature <,> uh <,> lot of  
work is being done in Canadian literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#6:1:A>
This is <}> <-> <.> main </.> </-> <=> mainly </=> </}> because <,>  
I am giving you this piece of information <,> uh <,> because there are number  
of fellowships <,> and scholarships available <,> for Commonwealth uh studies  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#7:1:A>
And uh <,> not many people are aware of these <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#8:1:A>
Now uh <,,> literatures in Commonwealth again be divided into two  
parts one is White one is Black <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#9:1:A>
In White we have three major <,> literatures <,> Australian <,>  
Canadian <,> and New Zealand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#10:1:A>
Uh <,> and in Black you know most of these literatures Nigerian  
South African <,> Indian Pakistani <,> and other literatures <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#11:1:A>
Now there won't be many fellowships in <,> as far as uh Asian  
countries are concerned or African countries are concerned <,> but there are  
some in West Indians <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#12:1:A>
And we also have a <,> <O> one word </O> meeting next year <,> in  
uh <,> Kingston Jamaica in West Indies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#13:1:A>
So those of you who are interested they could send their papers it  
means there are three themes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#14:1:A>
<-> I once </-> I remember <,> on which I am presenting a paper is  
the theme of voyage <,,> theme of flight <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#15:1:A>
Uh <,> this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one  
writer <,> how she or he has projected this theme in his <,> uh writing in  
poetry or fiction 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#16:1:A>
For example uh <,> it could be a voyage in case of one Anita Desai  
<-> Desai </-> from <,> uhm outside world into inside world 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#17:1:A>
Then she talks of <,> you know inner world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#18:1:A>
This is a voyage 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#19:1:A>
So voyage can be interpreted <,> in several ways <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#20:1:A>
Even this East West encounter is a voyage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#21:1:A>
So you <-> we </-> don't have to be scared of the theme you can  
write anything <,> with <,> voyage as the <,> as the basic modem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#22:1:A>
This will be in West Indies next year nineteen ninety-two <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#23:1:A>
And uhm <,> uh all applications have to be made to <,> at <O> one  
word </O> London or <,> the professor in charge there <,> in Jamaica in  
Kingston <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#24:1:A>
Uh <,> apart from that <,> West Indies <,> we have uh <,>  
fellowships in Canadian literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#25:1:A>
I think most of you know that <,> at Delhi we have an institute  
known as the Shastri <,> uh Institute Institute of Indo-Canadian Studies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#26:1:A>
And they give <,> large number of fellowships <,> uh atleast twelve  
to teachers of English 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#27:1:A>
And these fellowships they <,> arrange in at three levels <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#28:1:A>
One is the five week fellowship <,> one is the three four months  
fellowship and one is nine months <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#29:1:A>
Uh again <,> five weeks fellowship is divided into two uh part <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#30:1:A>
One is those who are persuing there research <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#31:1:A>
Second thing is <,> uh <,> faculty in recent uh programme <,> that  
is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in Canadian studies  
but they would like to be acquainted with the <,> Canadian literature or  
Canadian studies <,> and come back and teach <,> uh at B A and M A level or  
<,> as guide <,> for M A M phil or <,> Ph D students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#32:1:A>
The so <,> these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you  
know students in the sense scholars who are working <,> who are researching  
<,> for their M Phil Ph <w> D's </w> <,> and also for those <,> you know  
there is a different caption 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#33:1:A>
And also for those <,> one is known as <,> uhm study programme <,>  
another is faculty <?> improvement </?> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#34:1:A>
And four month is again for those <,> who want to study <,> in a  
more comprehensive <,> uh comprehensive fashion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#35:1:A>
And nine months is mainly for those <,> who are persuing their  
research in <,> uh Canadian literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#36:1:A>
Uh <,> terms are very lucrative both <O> one word </O> and uh uh uh  
very good uh <,> amount of payment fellowships <,> during your stay in Canada  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#37:1:A>
This is about Canada <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#38:1:A>
Application forms are available <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#39:1:A>
And uh <,> then third is Australia 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#40:1:A>
Australia has not uh <,> instituted any fellowship <,> as yet <,>  
but uh <,> <-> they are </-> they have a very <,> uh uhm uhm <,> ambitious  
programme <,> and they have set up as Professor Pandey said the other day <,>  
Australian <,> Indian Council <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#41:1:A>
Uhm <,> this is just being set up <,> <w> it'll </w> come into  
operation next year ninety-two <,> early ninety-two <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#42:1:A>
And uh <,> under this programme they will be <,> instituting  
fellowships <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#43:1:A>
They are going to set up a centre <,> uh centre for <,,> Australia  
<,,> India studies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#44:1:A>
Similarly Indian Society for Commonwealth studies <,> of which  
professor Pandey is the Chairman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#45:1:A>
Uh <,,> our society is going to set up <,,> an Indian centre <->  
centre </-> which will be known as Indo <,> Australian centre uh <,,> of  
studies you know <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#46:1:A>
Indo uh <,> sorry <,> uh centre for Indo-Australian studies <,>  
well both the names are so similar <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#47:1:A>
Their is Australian-Indian <,> ours is Indo-Australian <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#48:1:A>
Uh where we set up <,,> this only time will tell <,> uh Australian  
government is very helpful <,> and fellowships <,> <-> will </-> <,> are in  
the offing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#49:1:A>
Apart from that <,,> as far as the availability of books is  
concerned <,> uh Australian government has a very liberal norm in giving  
books not to individual but to institutions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#50:1:A>
And there are certain Universities <,,> <O> cough </O> which have  
been identified as <,,> the Universities where Commonwealth literature <,>  
research is going on 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#51:1:A>
Poona University is one of them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#52:1:A>
The other Universities <,> uh the Universities I know of which <,>  
one is Delhi University <,> <O> one word </O> University <+> of </+> Anantpur  
<,> Poona University is third Bombay University Calcutta University Bangalore  
University <,> Mysore University <,> Chandigarh Punjab University <,> uh  
these seven eight Universities <,> then Osmania <,> then Central University  
Hyderabad <,> these are nine ten Universities I remember 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#53:1:A>
Out of the nineteen Universities which have been identified as  
centres <,> uhm <,> which can promote the study of <,> Australian literature  
and <,> Commonwealth literature as a whole <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#54:1:A>
So if you need some books on Australian literature <,> it is <,>  
that through <,> uh get in touch with these uh <,> uhm Universities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#55:1:A>
Poona University has just been given some seventy or eighty books  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#56:1:A>
So from time to time <,> they receive books <,,> uh from the  
government <,> Australian Embassy here <,> and these books are dispatched to  
various Universities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#57:1:A>
So amongst Australian writers <,,> the most popular has been <,>  
Patrick White because he is the only <,> writer who got Nobel Prize <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#58:1:A>
And uh <,> as far as Patrick White is concerned <,> I think all  
novel <,> most of it <,> most of the novels <,> by Patrick White they are  
available <,> in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#59:1:A>
A lot of fiction is also available <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#60:1:A>
But other writers which are coming up <,> like Rodney Hall <,> who  
visited Delhi University as a visiting <,> uhm fellow last year for about  
four months <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#61:1:A>
Uh Rodney Hall and <,> <?> Leftmary </?> <,> and uh Judith <O> one  
word </O> <,> lot of coach who came to India some three years ago <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#62:1:A>
A lot of work has been done on these writers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#63:1:A>
I will be very happy if uh we take up <,> research on these writers  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#64:1:A>
Uh because I should have been saying so <,> British literature uh  
<,> is any way dying <,> uh even American literature has become stale <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#65:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> time we <,> focus our attention on new literatures  
<,> which are coming up <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#66:1:A>
So if you want uh books on <}> <-> <.> Aust </.> </-> <=>  
Australian </=> </}> literature you please get in touch with <,> these  
institutions <,> these uh <,> bodies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#67:1:A>
But by next year we are going to have lot of books <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#68:1:A>
Penguin <,,> uh <,> has got into Australian now some two three  
years ago <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#69:1:A>
And they are bringing out a series of books <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#70:1:A>
They are monographs and literary books <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#71:1:A>
Recently they have brought out <,> no less than I think <,> forty  
to forty-five titles on Australian literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#72:1:A>
I have some with me <,> uh specially one <,> <-> which is </->  
which is the literary history of <,> Australia <w> it's </w> an excellent  
book 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#73:1:A>
If you were to look at that book <,> if you read that book <,> you  
get to know everything about Australia <,,> specially about women studies <,>  
about aboriginal literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#74:1:A>
There is so much common <,> between India and Australia <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#75:1:A>
And uh I am very hopeful by next year I think we are going to have  
<,> many more books <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#76:1:A>
So from that we come to <,> the beginnings of novel in India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#77:1:A>
Uh <,,> as all of us you know that <,> drama <,,> lyrics <,,> and  
short stories <,> and other forms of literature <,> they have been there <,>  
both in England <,> in Europe in India <,> India since ages 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#78:1:A>
But drama <,,> I am sorry but novel <,> came into existence only  
very recently 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#79:1:A>
This is a recent phenomenon <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#80:1:A>
In England as all of us know <,> the novel <,> uh the origin of  
novel <,> or flowering of novel I should say <,> is uh <,> uhm linked with  
Henry Fielding and Richardson <,> eighteenth century <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#81:1:A>
Uh <,> we always say that it takes about hundred years for a  
movement to come to India from England or from Europe or from America <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#82:1:A>
So but in <.> Ind </.> as far as India is concerned <,> we have the  
first two novels in nineteenth century only <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#83:1:A>
Uhm <,> and uh <,> there is the controversy which is the first  
novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#84:1:A>
But we can talk of some first great novels <,> and one of them is  
Chandu <w> Menon's </w> <mention> Indulekha </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#85:1:A>
Now when we talk of <,> a novel in India <,> it has a <,> different  
uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in England or novel in  
Europe or novel in America <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#86:1:A>
Because novel in India is a classic collective expressions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#87:1:A>
It comprises fiction from all regional literatures 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#88:1:A>
We don't have what is Indian literature we <,> we can not define  
Indian literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#89:1:A>
Indian literature means <,> literatures of all the regions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#90:1:A>
Hindi is uh <,> just now a national language 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#91:1:A>
It doesn't have a identity of its own 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#92:1:A>
So Hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#93:1:A>
So Hindi Urdu Marathi Bengali Punjabi <,> these are all literatures  
and all <,> put together they form Indian literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#94:1:A>
So this is a collective expression 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#95:1:A>
So when we talk of Indian novel <,> we talk of <,> novel in all  
branches <,> uhm <,> in the country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#96:1:A>
Now <,,> how did it come to flourish <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#97:1:A>
In ninteenth century <,> practically there was no novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#98:1:A>
And uh <,> uhm till uh <,> middle of that nineteenth century there  
was no novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#99:1:A>
It is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of <,,> Christian  
missionaries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#100:1:A>
When they came to India <,> they wanted people to read Bible <,>  
and since they wanted people <+> to read Bible </+> they learnt <,> our  
languages they learnt <,> south Indian languages 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#101:1:A>
First of all Tamil <,> uhm then Malyalam <,> these languages they  
learnt 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#102:1:A>
And they translated the Bible into <,> all living languages <,> of  
that time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#103:1:A>
This is the basic <,,> uh <,> so if you want to note down the  
certain points <,> you can just say in point number one that <,> uhm novel  
<,,> as a literary phenomenon <,> is new to India 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#104:1:A>
Now novel you put in double inverted commas <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#105:1:A>
Novel as a <,> the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to India  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#106:1:A>
We all know epics <,> lyrics <,> dramas short-stories fables <w>  
they've </w> been they have there uh <,> respectable uhm industries going  
back to several centuries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#107:1:A>
But it is only during the second half of nineteenth century <,>  
that <,> novel took its root in <,> in India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#108:1:A>
Now uh <,> for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have  
to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#109:1:A>
And it is because of uh western impact on <,> so you can take down  
second point is that <,> <w> it's </w> because of the western impact on India  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#110:1:A>
Western impact on <,> India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#111:1:A>
This is because of the western impact that there was a formal  
development of prose 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#112:1:A>
And I said <,> as I said <,> that the Christian missionaries they  
wanted Indians to read the Bible <,,> so they read our languages and then  
they translated the Bible <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#113:1:A>
So that gave a fillip <,> to uh <,> prose writing in our country 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#114:1:A>
And then from the prose medium <,> it uh brought into currency <,>  
uh <,> translation and then <,> from a novel <,> the proper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#115:1:A>
Then third point is write down that <,> the term novel is a  
collective expression 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#116:1:A>
These are very important points 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#117:1:A>
So once you know these points you can explain them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#118:1:A>
Novel <,,> in India is a collective expression <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#119:1:A>
It comprises fiction of some length <,,> produced in several <,,>  
regional languages of India <,,> comprises fiction of some length produced in  
several regional languages of India <,> like Bengali <,,> Hindi <,> Urdu <,>  
Marathi <,> Punjabi etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#120:1:A>
Now <,> as you know that it was mainly in Bengal that <,> Indian  
literary renaissance <,> took place <,> in nineteenth century <,> with the  
establishment of Sir William Fort college <,> and uh setting up of <,> a  
printing press in Sarempore by Christian missionaries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#121:1:A>
They <-> they </-> of course <+> had </+> motive <-> was </-> only  
to popularise <,> Christianity 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#122:1:A>
But in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education  
<,> and uh specially prose uh writing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#123:1:A>
Now once it became popular <,> uh people started writing uh <,> uh  
<,> prose and novels <,> and uh <,> the first attempt <,> which was made <,,>  
uh in south India <,> was that of Chandu Menon <,> when he wrote his novel  
<mention> Indulekha </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#124:1:A>
It has been rightly held as a first <,,> first significant novel  
<,> in Malyalam <,> and also of course as a matter of fact in India 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#125:1:A>
But there is a controversy because there are so many so many  
novels written during those two three decades <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#126:1:A>
So it is the first significant novel <,> in Malyalam <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#127:1:A>
It it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine <,,> and  
published in eighteen-ninety <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#128:1:A>
It faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but  
these are the most recognized <,> dates <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#129:1:A>
Uhm <,,> now one thing we have to keep in mind is that Chandu  
Menon was not a professional writer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#130:1:A>
He was a judge by profession 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#131:1:A>
He was a lawyer then judge <,> and he can be compared for that  
matter <,> with Henry Fielding who was a lawyer and then a judge <,> and it  
was his passtime <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#132:1:A>
He was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss  
novels <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#133:1:A>
And uh <,> he was greatly <}> <-> <.> impre </.> </-> <=>  
impressed </=> </}> by <,> English novels <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#134:1:A>
And uhm <,> very often he <,,> uh <,> he felt that he should write  
a novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#135:1:A>
And he was thoroughly impressed by English manners <,> English  
people English language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#136:1:A>
Uh he was a typical Indian person who was <,> uh accost to English  
culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by  
it <,,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#137:1:A>
And uhm his wife was also of the same views <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#138:1:A>
And very often she used to exhort him to write a novel <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#139:1:A>
And one of his friends <,,> he uh suggested that <,> uh there is a  
novel by Disreily <,> and the name of the novel was <,> which Henrietta some  
Henrietta I remember <,> uh he wanted <,> him to <,,> uh this is Henrietta  
Temple 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#140:1:A>
Please just write down the name of the novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-022#141:1:A>
This was written by Benjamin Disreily <,,>
