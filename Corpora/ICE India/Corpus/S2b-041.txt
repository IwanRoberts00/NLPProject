Professor Jahagirdar <,,> <&> sound of bell </&> has been  
extremely kind <,,> to me <,,> I can thank him <,,> without <,,> deserving  
<,,> for my work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#2:1:A>
My friend Ashok <,,> has given me the right treatment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#3:1:A>
Uh before you <,,> start your <w> day's </w> work in the morning  
<,,> you have to catch your <,,> oxen <,,> and then you must <,,> put the  
<,,> ropes <,> through their nose <,,> and then <,> get on with the <w> day's  
</w> jobs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#4:1:A>
Which he has done for me <,,> <O> cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#5:1:A>
The other <,,> reason why I feel I do not deserve <,> to be standing  
here and giving a public lecture <,,> is <,,> quite obvious <,,> <O> clearing  
his throat </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#6:1:A>
As you can see <,,> the lecture is not meant for people like me <,,>  
uhm <,> I can't keep my papers on and then read <,> uh is meant for people  
who are <,,> normal <,,> <O> clearing his throat </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#7:1:A>
I am somewhat <,> different <,> from normal <,,> but <w> I'll </w>  
do <,> what I think <,> needs to be done <,> because the subject on which I  
wish to speak <,> has become <,,> if not here <,> in many other places in the  
country <,,> and <,,> awfully important question <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#8:1:A>
As you have come here <,> uh uh <,,> forsaking your lunch hour <,> I  
will not take more time <,,> to <,> uh <,> tell you how I do not deserve to  
be here but get on with it now that I am <,,> here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#9:1:A>
Dear <?> panel </?> students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#10:1:A>
By way of introduction to my talk today <,> I must explain two <,>  
ground <,> facts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#11:1:A>
One which is pervasive <,,> throughout non-metropolitant <,> India  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#12:1:A>
The other which is threatening to change <,> the foundation <,> of  
English teaching <,,> or rather <,> to do <indig> kar seva </indig> <,> with  
it <,,> that is to say to destroy it <,> completely <,,> In itself may not be  
a bad thing at all 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#13:1:A>
I don't mind if English is destroyed <,> the worst thing that will  
happen is <w> I'll </w> lose my job <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#14:1:A>
I think I can find another one <,> somewhere <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#15:1:A>
The first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university  
level study <,> alone <,,> but also the basic levels <,> of English teaching  
<,> and learning at the High School <,> Junior College <,> and College level  
<,,> as well <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#16:1:A>
Now what are these two threats <,> that I spoke of <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#17:1:A>
The first one comes <,> from the non- <,> teaching of the English  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#18:1:A>
School and college teachers <,> generally <,,> and even some  
university teachers <,,> actually <,> do not <,> teach English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#19:1:A>
What is that they do can be given <,> other names <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#20:1:A>
But instead <,> the students don't learn English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#21:1:A>
I shall mention only one <,> perhaps the central reason <,> that  
they do not <,> know <,> English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#22:1:A>
Anyhow the result is <,> that they begin to justify <,> and  
rationalize <,> their failure <,,> by arguing that we really do not know  
English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#23:1:A>
English <,,> that it is a hang over from the colonial <,,> British  
Raj <,> that we must <,> really <,> attend to our regional language <,> or  
mother tongue <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#24:1:A>
Now these are destruction tactics <,,> because those who wish to  
honour their <,> mother tongue <,> have always learnt it <,> under any  
circumstances <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#25:1:A>
More of that <,> a little later <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#26:1:A>
The second threat <,> more recent <,,> powerful because its  
exponents <,> have generally have the advantage of English medium <,> urban  
education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#27:1:A>
And also <,> because their arguments come <,> from abroad <,> in  
very sophisticated <,> and precise words <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#28:1:A>
These people argue <,,> as though we have not have any Tilak <,,>  
Chiplunkar <,,> Phule <,,> or Karmveer <,,> that to study English is to  
continue <,,> English or British colonization <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#29:1:A>
That if we study English <,> because of any reason whatever <,> we  
become post-colonially colonized <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#30:1:A>
And besides <,> they also speak in the same way <,> of the means to  
engage in culture studies <,,> but deny the simple and obvious <,> fact <,>  
that the greatest <,> single <,> repository of culture <,> is its literature  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#31:1:A>
Therefore they argue that we should not study English literature  
<,> but only <,> Indo- English literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#32:1:A>
That we should not study English literature <,> but local <,> and  
world <,> literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#33:1:A>
They attempt to convert English Departments <,> into cultural <w>  
study's </w> department <,,> or departments of world literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#34:1:A>
Is there anything <,> seriously wrong with these two threats <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#35:1:A>
Can we do both English studies <,> and Indian studies <,> if <,> we  
wish to <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#36:1:A>
History tells us most emphatically <,> yes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#37:1:A>
There are persons in my own audience here today <,> who have done  
this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#38:1:A>
Therefore <,> on the excuse of looking at one such teacher <,,> on  
English <,> Ayyappa Panikar from Kerala <,,> who has both studied and taught  
English well <,> and worked <,> effectively in his own mother tongue <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#39:1:A>
I propose to examine the basic problems <,> involved <,> in being  
uncertain <,> regarding whether to study and teach English <,> or not <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#40:1:A>
That is why my title <mention> To be uh to English <,> or not to  
English </mention> <,> the lesson of <,> Ayyappa Panikar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#41:1:A>
English in India it appears <,> is in a crisis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#42:1:A>
It appears to be insecure <,> to observers of the linguistic <,>  
political arena <,> as also to those <,> in the academic arena <,,> which <,>  
some academia is also <,> another linguistic political arena <,> as though  
<,> we did not always know it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#43:1:A>
At least one State in India <,,> Uttar Pradesh <,> seems openly at  
war with English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#44:1:A>
An International Congress of Marathi <,> recently <,> made a great  
deal of noise about the continuing <,> hegemony <,> of English in Maharashtra  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#45:1:A>
Without any hesitation however <,> it needs to be said that either  
there is no real crisis <,> but that one is being conjured up <,> for  
ideological <,> game <,> by ideologues <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#46:1:A>
Or that it is essentially the same old <,> pre-Independence crisis  
<,> which is hoped to have stoped <,> with Independence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#47:1:A>
More than four whole decades <,> have past since the crucial  
achievement <,> I mean <,> Independance <,> of an essentially older  
generation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#48:1:A>
To be found still harping on the same crisis <,> in the belief that  
it still <,> exists unchanged <,> or in the hope <,> that from keeping it  
alive will approve <,> linguistic <,> political <,> or academic <,> and  
political merit <,> seems <,> backward looking <,> if not <O> one word </O>  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#49:1:A>
And at least for that reason <,> unjustified <,> and unjustifiable  
for a nation <,> that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of  
development <,> not my word <,,> in the space of a very few Five Years Plans  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#50:1:A>
Mixed up in this crisis scenerio <,> is a conscience crisis <,> or  
what is at least made to look like it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#51:1:A>
Some in English teaching establishments are saying <,,> <quote> Why  
should they be teaching English <,> literature why not <,> our own <,,> for  
instance <,> why should be the departments be called <,> departments of  
English <,> and not departments of literature </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#52:1:A>
There are also those who would like to keep reminding us <,> that  
English in India today <,> is a matter of post-colonial colonization <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#53:1:A>
Regarding the first sort of question <,> we may answer <,,> first  
<,> that if other literatures need to be <,> <}> <-> <.> stu </.> </-> <=>  
taught or study </=> </}> they can be taught without teaching them in the  
English department <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#54:1:A>
To wish to teach other literatures in English department <,> and I  
mean other language literatures Marathi Hindi Telugu <,> Malyalam <,,> imply  
some great confusion <,> regarding the function of English in India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#55:1:A>
Second <,> there seems to be no reason to deny <,> that India does  
not need <,> so many departments of English literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#56:1:A>
Third <,,> there is nothing <,,> <&> sound of bell </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#57:1:A>
Third there is nothing more colonial <,> in teaching English <,>  
British American <,> Commonwealth <,> included <,,> in a department of  
English <,> than in teaching Hindi literature <,> in a department of Hindi  
<,> or Organic Chemistry in a department of Organic Chemistry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#58:1:A>
As for the more fundamental <,> question <quote> Why English at all  
</quote> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#59:1:A>
If anyone feels deeply that their career in English <,,> language  
or literature <,> teaching is either empty <,> patriotic <,,> or a super-  
colonial betrayal <,> they can atleast by way of that career <,> <-> to </->  
take up some less renegade <,> or more self-respectful career <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#60:1:A>
This is not to dismiss <,,> struggling consciences <,> but to place  
them on par with other such <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#61:1:A>
To take just one parallel instance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#62:1:A>
Those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of <indig>  
Ayurveda </indig> <,,> in the same way <,> such Allopath <,> should give up  
western medicine <,> and <}> <-> trained </-> <+> train </+> </}> in <indig>  
Ayurveda </indig> <,> or another career <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#63:1:A>
I would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by  
saying <,> that <?> unskilled </?> assessment will help avoid <?>  
schizophrenia </?> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#64:1:A>
Further is <,> <mention> To English <,> or not to English  
</mention> <,> that seems to be the question <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#65:1:A>
For anything between <,> means waste through confusion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#66:1:A>
Let us take another look at this crisis <,> or dilemma even though  
we settle the question once <,> and the reasons for doing so <,> have not  
changed <,> since then <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#67:1:A>
What is this crisis politically <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#68:1:A>
How long shall we <,> if we shall <,> let this English language  
continue as the major link language of the country <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#69:1:A>
When will Hindi <,> take over <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#70:1:A>
No one seems to be in right mood to ask <,> <quote> Why should <,>  
Hindi <,,> take over <,,> or what if <,> Hindi <,> takes over as a link  
language of our national <,> life <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#71:1:A>
What shall we do <,> about our international life <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#72:1:A>
Which <,> whether we like it or not <,> does endanger those subtle  
and growth way <,> on our national life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#73:1:A>
What is the crisis ideologically <,,> are we <,,> ? </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#74:1:A>
Apparently <w> it's </w> a rhetorical question <,> to being or to  
<,> to be <,> or to to continue to be colonized by the language <,> or rather  
earlier <,> colonial rulers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#75:1:A>
But that reaction is a feeling known <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#76:1:A>
And indeed to such a question that should be our answer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#77:1:A>
But ideological arguments in this connection <,,> come in English  
<,,> mostly addressd to English users <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#78:1:A>
And what is complicating if not worst they seem to come <,> in  
English via Europe and America <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#79:1:A>
At least for me <,,> after such knowledge what forgiveness <,,> in  
any case this agrument also seems <,> just like the political argument to  
fail to address the very practical problem before us <,> or before the nation  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#80:1:A>
If not English <,> then what <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#81:1:A>
For the English teaching establishments the apparently active  
English departments in the university <,> but by implication of the passive  
departments in colleges and schools 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#82:1:A>
What is the crisis <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#83:1:A>
In simple terms <,> people are asking again <,,> and again and  
again <,,> <quote> Ought we to be teaching <,> studying Engish </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#84:1:A>
<w> I've </w> already tried to indicate my answer to that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#85:1:A>
If our aim is taken for granted <,> when <,> then this amongsts to  
among other things <,> distraction confusion waste of time and effort <,> and  
eventually a most horandous shortfall <,> in our achievement of the goals we  
have set for ourselves in this regard <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#86:1:A>
Should we not ask such a fundamental question <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#87:1:A>
Obviously we may <,,> and we shall <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#88:1:A>
But whether we ignore its practical implications <,> is the issue  
for me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#89:1:A>
And assuming that our nation has <,> affirmatively answer the  
question already <,> I would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow  
confusion or distraction to affect adversly <,> our performance of the task  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#90:1:A>
Now as a democracy <,> let us have admited right away <,> we might  
well claim the right to reopen <,> the issue <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#91:1:A>
Take away <,> the assumption <,> create the condition that our  
previous decision need not be considered <,> our <foreign> fate accompli  
</foreign> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#92:1:A>
But as long as we do not do so <,> with full awareness of  
consequences <,> we have better not do anything that will foster <,> or  
enhance <,> the downward trend <,> in achievement of the task <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#93:1:A>
Not as a negative <,> implication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#94:1:A>
What must we do if we do decide <,> not to teach or learn English  
any more <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#95:1:A>
Well we must then decide <,> what we shall <,> do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#96:1:A>
I see only three alternatives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#97:1:A>
Alternative one <,,> <mention> Shall we teach the rest of the world  
an Indian language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#98:1:A>
Even say if you like <,> Hindi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#99:1:A>
So that we may converse with them or in all ways <,> that  
international and therefore national life demands </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#100:1:A>
Alternative two <,> <mention> Shall we try to live our national  
international life without English <,> and without any replacement <,> for it  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#101:1:A>
And three <,> <mention> Or shall we choose an alternative language  
<,> another international language like German <,> Russian French or Japanese  
<,> or another of our very own choice <,> in which to conduct our  
international business </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#102:1:A>
If we choose the first alternative <,> fine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#103:1:A>
Let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred  
years or so <,> in which we must become internationally so important <,> that  
outsiders wish to learn Hindi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#104:1:A>
Then <,,> arrrange a <O> one word </O> like programme <,> all over  
the world <,,> or a Hindi Council to rival the British Council <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#105:1:A>
Find in other words the ways and means <,> to install Hindi as our  
international language which we can then continue <,> to use <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#106:1:A>
Lessons of the last four decades or so right here in India <,>  
ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#107:1:A>
If we choose the second alternative <,> not to bother with any  
international language <,> we shall either create an Indian culture <,> and  
nation <,,> precisely <,> given the cultural linguistic diversity in India  
<,,> it may not be quite so bad <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#108:1:A>
We have a very rich culture <,> or we shall be subject to <,,> so  
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources  
<,> have had <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#109:1:A>
That is to say even if we could imagine situation of international  
linguistic vacuum for India <,> how long we may be able to sustain <,> our  
integrity and even our sovereignity ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#110:1:A>
In a fiercly international world <+> this </+> is not in a moot  
query <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#111:1:A>
The answer is too depressing to contemplate <,> especially I hope  
it is depressing to those <,> who feel the wealth of previous colonization  
feeling even today <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#112:1:A>
Suppose we take the third alternative <,> to switch to another  
language than English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#113:1:A>
A language not tainted by colonial <,,> oppressive past <,> for us  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#114:1:A>
By the way <,> is there a major language anywhere <,,> that is not  
tainted by <,> a colonial oppressive past <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#115:1:A>
This question is just as revealing in the past tense <,> and apply  
to languages like Sanskrit <,> or Telugu <,> or Marathi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#116:1:A>
What will that decision entail <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#117:1:A>
Dismantling all our international and also related <,> national  
business and activity <,> that depends on English today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-041#118:1:A>
Dismantling our machinery for proliferation of English <,>  
preparing for and installing in its place <,> the entire machinery required  
<,> in the process of teaching and learning <,> that new international  
language <,,> </I>
