<ICE-IND:W2F-012#3:1>
Pulling out the eight grey strands from her hair, Shrivatsa asks
me for the umpteenth time why I spilled the <indig> <it> soma </it> </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#4:1>
<quote> ` Shri, my love,' </quote> I say, <quote> ` you know I
didn't do it on purpose.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#5:1>
I tripped, and the <indig> <it> soma </it> </indig> I held in my mouth
for you spilled on the ground.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#6:1>
But wasn't it my idea to make you lick it off the ground?'</quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#7:1>
<quote> ` Yes, and that ant I swallowed along with it keeps me
awake at night as she wanders in my bloodstream, forever immortal.' </quote>
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#8:1>
<quote> ` You should have spit out the little sucker right away.'
</quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#9:1>
<quote> ` Sure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#10:1>
And with that the few drops I had managed to lick up ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#11:1>
Those precious drops that stopped my ageing at these eight grey
strands.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#12:1>
But I know if I had spit it all out, it would have made you happy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#13:1>
You could have then clung to the breast of that woman foreover.'
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#14:1>
<quote> ` Oh, for <w> heaven's </w> sake, Shri.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#15:1>
If I had wanted that to happen, why would I have brought the <indig>
<it> soma </it> </indig> for you in the first place ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#16:1>
I put in so much effort, pretending I was a god, pulling at the head
of Vasuki, that serpentine demiurge, to churn Mount Mandar in the ocean, just
to get a sip at that brimming cup of the gods.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#17:1>
And I didn't need it, you know that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#18:1>
It was for you I ran miles, holding the liquid in my mouth.' </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#19:1>
<quote> ` Why not?

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#20:1>
I was always ready to give you more than that woman would have.'
</quote> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#21:1>
<quote> ` <w> She's </w> my mother.' </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#22:1>
<quote> ` Why do you keep calling her that?

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#23:1>
<w> She's </w> not your mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#24:1>
You were never in her womb.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#25:1>
In fact, you didn't draw life from any woman.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#26:1>
You were spilled on the bosom of this earth even before you were
born.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#27:1>
If anyone is your mother, it is this earth <w> you've </w> loused up
so badly.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#28:1>
I become quiet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#29:1>
I always do when Shrivatsa brings up the circumstances of my birth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#30:1>
I shouldn't have told her, but once in the <it> Dwapur Yuga </it> an
elephant charged at me for no apparent reason.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#31:1>
Shri wanted to know why it had done so, unprovoked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#32:1>
It was then that I told her about the first betrayal and my own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#33:1>
I told her how I betrayed my father, <indig> Agni </indig> , through
that elephant, in consequence on which the God of Fire cursed him that he and
his whole species would have twisted tongues for the rest of time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#34:1>
But <w> that's </w> another story. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#35:1>
I related to her the beginning, of beginnings.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#36:1>
The tale of the lonely Grandfather who wanted a companion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#37:1>
He made the left side of his body fall apart and created a woman.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#38:1>
She was his daughter, for he created her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#39:1>
But with her he admitted the element of incest into Creation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#40:1>
The gods were angry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#41:1>
They were angry because <indig> Prajapati </indig> intended to do
that which for the first time had to be expressed as forbidden. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#42:1>
<quote> ` Our Creator was sinful,' </quote> Shri said, shaking
her head as if to say, <quote> ` how can we be different?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#43:1>
<quote> ` No, not sin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#44:1>
It wasn't sin,' </quote> I told her, for Sin, as the mortals know it,
wasn't born till much later.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#45:1>
In fact, he is <w> Shrivatsa's </w> half-brother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#46:1>
She hates to admit that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#47:1>
She refuses to have any connections with him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#48:1>
But sibling inclinations are hard to hide. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#49:1>
To go back to my story: the angry gods sent <indig> Rudra
</indig> to stop <indig> Prajapati </indig> from defiling the chastity of his
Creation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#50:1>
But by the time <indig> Rudra </indig> reached the shores of Kasuki,
the site the Grandfather had chosen to begin Creating, that which mustn't
even be intended was already in act.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#51:1>
In anger, the God shot an arrow at <indig> <w> Prajapati's </w>
</indig> heaving back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#52:1>
At the pang of pain from the arrow, the Grandfather withdrew his
phallus, and the remaining semen flowed onto the earth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#53:1>
<indig> Agni </indig> blew on the seed with his fiery breath, and the
Angiras brothers came to be born.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#54:1>
The God of Fire counted seven wailing babies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#55:1>
He did not notice the one born from the semen that had flowed into
the reeds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#56:1>
That who he never acknowledged, and never knew, was I, the eighth
Angiras. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#57:1>
When I told Shrivatsa this the first time, she didn't believe me,
so I let her look into my mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#58:1>
She saw eternal memory there, along <O> <&> page </&> 2 </O> with
immortality.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#59:1>
But instead of seeing Vedic matters; truth, divinity, fortitude, and
so on, she saw contradictions to the Golden Age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#60:1>
<quote> ` Why?' </quote> she wanted to know. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#61:1>
I told her how for days I lay entangled in the reeds, wailing for
my mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#62:1>
I fed on the watery breast of the Kasuki river and made friends with
the fish and birds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#63:1>
They told me stories about the beautiful seven babies who fed on the
ever-flowing breasts of the Daughter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#64:1>
I knew they were my lucky brothers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#65:1>
I envied them and longed to join them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#66:1>
One day Indra sent an <indig> <it> apsara </it> </indig> , to disrupt
the <indig> samadhi </indig> of a <indig> rishi </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#67:1>
The King of Gods was nervous because the <indig> rishi </indig> was
becoming much too powerful through his asceticism.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#68:1>
Bathing one morning in the Kasuki, the <indig> <it> apsara </it>
</indig> saw me lying in the reeds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#69:1>
Taking me for an abandoned baby, she picked me up and took me with
her to Amaravati, <w> Indra's </w> golden city.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#70:1>
She was the only mother I knew.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#71:1>
I nursed at her breast and played in her lap.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#72:1>
When I grew a little older, she took me to court with her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#73:1>
No one questioned my abrupt appearance, because in those days babies
could be made by a simple conception in the mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#74:1>
I learned the workings of the court and also those of <indig> <w>
Indra's </w> </indig> mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#75:1>
He was my hero. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#76:1>
In <indig> Vaikuntha </indig> , my brothers, the seven Angiras,
learned the secrets of divinity from <indig> Agni </indig> and the <indig>
gurus </indig> , while I learned to cultivate an ego and how to overpower
enemies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#77:1>
They were taught to be future mediators between men and gods, whereas
I studied the art of spying and hypocrisy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#78:1>
To Indra anyone who wasn't weak was a prospective enemy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#79:1>
He connived with and manipulated the gods to assist him in destroying
those engaged in acquiring power through war or asceticism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#80:1>
The <indig> gurus </indig> and the gods never knew me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#81:1>
The <indig> Vedas </indig> never mentioned me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#82:1>
Even my mother didn't know who I was.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#83:1>
I was just another immortal nobody, created by an egotistical god or
<indig> rishi </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#84:1>
Only I knew my identity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#85:1>
I don't know why I kept silent about this.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#86:1>
Perhaps I feared no one one would believe me if I told them, or,
maybe, I didn't want to be a divine Angiras, a spiritual celestial, who would
never know the excitment of baser emotions.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#87:1>
Shri is the only person I told, because from the first instant I saw
her, I felt an <O> <&> page </&> 3 </O> emotion that was by no means
spiritual or heavenly, but of the earth. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#88:1>
I look at Shrivatsa.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#89:1>
She is pulling out the last grey hair.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#90:1>
<quote> ` Shri,' </quote> I say, going to her and slipping my
arms around her waist.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#91:1>
<quote> ` Do you remember when <indig> <w> Shiva's </w> </indig>
lovemaking made the Earth tremble on her tortoise?' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#92:1>
I reach up to fondle her breasts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#93:1>
<quote> ` Hm,' </quote> she says, covering my hands with her own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#94:1>
<quote> ` What a couple.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#95:1>
<quote> ` <w> We're </w> not too bad ourselves.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#96:1>
We can at least make the bed tremble.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#97:1>
She gives a little laugh and turns around to face me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#98:1>
Placing a kiss softly on my lips, she says, <quote> ` Come, or <w>
you'll </w> be late for the party.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#99:1>
<quote> ` To hell with the party.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#100:1>
<w> Let's </w> go to bed.' </quote> I let my lips linger on the
curve of her gentle breasts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#101:1>
Slapping me lightly on the back of my neck, she says, <quote> `
<w> We'll </w> be late for the party.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#102:1>
I groan into her breasts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#103:1>
<quote> ` Stop,' </quote> she says.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#104:1>
<quote> ` Besides, I want to save myself for another man tonight.'
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#105:1>
My head jerks up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#106:1>
<quote> ` Who?' </quote> I ask. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#107:1>
<quote> ` You don't know him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#108:1>
<w> He's <*> dotted line</*>' </quote> </w> she hesitates. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#109:1>
Disengaging herself from my arms, she continues, <quote> ` <w>
I've </w> been seeing him for a while.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#110:1>
<quote> ` Shrivatsa, you can't do this.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#111:1>
Why didn't you tell me?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#112:1>
She laughs and says, <quote> ` Aren't we jealous tonight,'
</quote> and runs into the bathroom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#113:1>
In a few minutes I hear the shower running. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#114:1>
I sit down on the edge of the bed, wondering at myself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#115:1>
I hadn't realized that the years had bred so much jealousy in me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#116:1>
I used to be able to accept <w> Shrivatsa's </w> liaisons as an
irrefutable law of nature.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#117:1>
In fact, I even encouraged her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#118:1>
So how could I explain the sudden contraction of my heart when she
mentioned this other man ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#119:1>
This was surely the nadir of time when even first-born immortals
like me were rebelling against preordained laws. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#120:1>
Shrivatsa pads out of the bathroom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#121:1>
Her bare, golden body <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O> gleams with drops of
moisture as she stands in the middle of the room, freeing her long, black
hair from the shower cap. </p>

<quote> ` Shri,' </quote> I say, <quote> ` <w> I've </w> been

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#124:1>
<quote> ` What?' </quote> she asks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#125:1>
I smile, for it isn't often now that I can surprise her. </p>

era, back in the sixteenth century.' </quote> </p>

I like to hear how the <indig> <it> apsaras </it> </indig> at <w>
Indra's </w> court were considered chaste and unspoiled even after they had
screwed hundreds of gods and <indig> rishis </indig> , not to mention their
own sons.' </quote> </p>

as though it were a weapon.

<quote> ` How would you know?

<w> You've </w> never had a baby?' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#192:1>
I say and bite my tongue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#193:1>
I hate to remind Shrivatsa of that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#194:1>
Many, many years ago, when babies could no longer be created by the
power of the mind, or <indig> Agni's </indig> fire, Shri told me she wanted a
child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#195:1>
I still remember her suicidal grief when I told her she couldn't.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#196:1>
<w> She's </w> <O> <&> page </&> 6 </O> barren.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#197:1>
And <w> it's </w> my fault, or rather <w> it's Parvati's </w> fault.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#198:1>
Once the gods and <indig> rishis </indig> went to Kailash to implore
Shiva to stop his violent lovemaking, because it made the Earth tremble on
her tortoise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#199:1>
Their intervention denied Parvati the embraces and seed of Shiva.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#200:1>
So she laid a curse on them that their wives would be forever
barren. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#201:1>
However, I went there for a different purpose.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#202:1>
I wanted to peep in on the divine pair and note down a few <indig>
<it> asans </it> </indig> , which years later could be included in the
<indig> <it> Kama Sutra </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#203:1>
Shri drops the comb on the floor, and runs a hand over her
supple, flat stomach.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#204:1>
<quote> ` <w> I'll </w> never know what it is to be a mother,'
</quote> she says softly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#205:1>
Then her fingers trace the veins visible through the transparent
skin of the inside of her forearm.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#206:1>
<quote> ` My only baby will be my ant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#207:1>
I wonder where it is now?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#208:1>
I take her naked form in my arms and rock her gently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#209:1>
<quote> ` <w> We'll </w> be late for the party,' </quote> she
says, suddenly breaking away from my arms.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#210:1>
<quote> ` And I still have to get dressed.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#211:1>
She rushes to the closet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-012#212:1>
I watch her bare bottom moving among the silk <indig> saris
</indig> , as she decides what to wear, envying her ability to snap back into
time so easily.

<ICE-IND:W2F-012#213:1>
Of late <w> I've </w> been having trouble doing that. </p> </I>
