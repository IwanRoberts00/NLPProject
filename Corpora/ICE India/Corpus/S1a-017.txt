Yes to start with <,> I left <,> Nipani hostel at three <w>
O'clock </w> <,> <{1> <[1> uh <,> and I was waiting for bus <,> in Nipani bus
stand for <,> for an hour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#9:1:C>
And it was uh different experience for me <,> and afterwards <,> I
reached Belgaum safely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#10:1:C>
And uh the tragedy started there <,> <{2> <[2> uhn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#11:1:C>
And I took a Belgaum and Dharwad bus that is beautiful <,> new bus
infact <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#12:1:C>

In fact I was the first man to go and ask <,> see what you are
doing like that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#20:1:A>
I think some fat people are there in the bus <,> he thought
<w> it's </w> a big luggage is there in the bus <,> so <,> so instead of
thinking that <w> it's </w> a bus he must have thought that <w> it's </w> a
lorry

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#21:1:B>
Yes yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#22:1:A>

in the night <,> and other things I asked <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#28:1:C>
But he replied sir safety is required <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#29:1:C>
Safety is required <,> that is for us and not for you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#30:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#31:1:A>
<}> <-> Safety </-> <=> safety </=> </}> is first than everything

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#32:1:A>
You must be facing it but whether it is your place or not

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#36:1:B>
It was a nice thing about Basavaraj <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#37:1:A>
He was there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#38:1:A>
So he was very lean personality <O> laughter </O> as if you
dissecting <w> you'll </w> get only some five to six kilo of <,> <{> <[>
flesh </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#39:1:C>
<[> Flesh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#40:1:A>
He was telling one day to my friends <,,> he had uh applied
for this <,> <{> <[> LIC <,> LIC for two <indig> lakhs </indig> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#41:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#42:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#43:1:A>
Two <indig> lakhs </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#44:1:B>
How can it be man <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#45:1:B>
He is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#46:1:A>
Only five kilo of flesh is there <,> <w> he's </w> <{> <[>
given two <indig> lakhs </indig> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#47:1:C>
<[> Even if we sell it </[> </{> it will around <,> two
hundred <indig> rupees </indig> <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#48:1:A>
<w> That's </w> how happened

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#49:1:C>
And if Dinesh was for two <indig> lakhs </indig> he was
telling <,> and that was a beautiful joke <,> we had experienced

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#50:1:A>
And when you were in degree <indig> na </indig> <,,> did you
read any of <w> Endumari's </w> novels <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#51:1:B>
Of course not <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#52:1:A>
Not of course not <,> fine

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#53:1:C>
I have read I have read

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#54:1:A>
You have read

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#55:1:C>
I have read <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#56:1:A>
Actually I have read almost all of his verses

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#57:1:A>
I liked it very much you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#58:1:A>
So even some of your bright point of your first person as the
techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#59:1:A>
And uh <,> I think recently in one magazines <w> it's </w> uh <,>
on the doom innocent electrical <,> he brought even that <,> uh who <,> your
Harshad Mehta also there

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#60:1:A>
He has brought in there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#61:1:B>
Really

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#62:1:A>
He has expressed very nicely here <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#63:1:C>
And in fact when you take up this uh Endamuri <w>
Veerendranath's </w> novels <,,> <w> it's </w> very thoroughly when you are
entering to degree or <,> some PG courses

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#64:1:C>
<w> It's </w> the real thing that we can enjoy in degree or <,> PG
courses

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#65:1:B>
Actually I wanted them to be translated to English <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#66:1:C>
Definitely definitely good better and read them <O> laughter
</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#67:1:B>
Actually I don't read Kannada novels

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#68:1:A>
Is it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#69:1:B>
It is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#70:1:A>
Then <{> <[> what what novels </[> do you read

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#71:1:C>
<[> Then you better read </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#72:1:B>
English

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#73:1:C>
English

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#74:1:A>
Uh <,,> whose novel have you read so far <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#75:1:B>
Hardy <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#76:1:A>
Hardy you read it as a <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#77:1:C>
<w> You've </w> read hardly <,> <w> you've </w> read it hardly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#78:1:A>
Hardly of <w> Hardy's </w> novels <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#79:1:A>
So <{> <[> and uh </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#80:1:C>
<[> And uh </[> </{> <,,> and <w> that's </w> the fine thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#81:1:C>
In fact uh <,> we have to read those things initially <,> <{> <[>
because that should have </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#82:1:A>
<[> First we should read enough uh </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#83:1:C>
Yes initially

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#84:1:B>
We can read our own

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#85:1:C>
It can suggest <,> it can suggest many ways <,> to read other
novels English novels particularly

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#86:1:C>
That the best point of <,> if <w> you'll </w> if we take up
Endamuri as <,> our model <,> definitely we can grasp enough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#87:1:C>
That was my point of view <,> about Endamuri

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#88:1:C>
Of course I read others uh Endamuri this one K T Gatti and Satarnas
also but <w> it's </w> <,,> it lacked something <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#89:1:A>
Uh but even in English writers you know I read Jacquelins <,>
of course though <,> though they are the best sellers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#90:1:A>
I read Jacquelins Susan <,> and Herald Robins <,> and some such
other

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#91:1:A>
Supposing your <,> Laurence <?> Sanxaz </?> <,> such novels <w>
I've </w> read <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#92:1:A>
But not that much general matter is included in their novels <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#93:1:A>
There is some plot the <,> hero comes and he does something

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#94:1:A>
If heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run <,> the villains
come and it ends there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#95:1:A>
But uh one of her novels as Jacquelins Susan an American novelist
<,> I like the novel <,> uh which one that is uh <,> <mention> Valley of Dogs
</mention> <,> in which he said <,> one line beautiful line comes <,,>
<quote> we all have different sides that we show to different people </quote>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#96:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#97:1:A>
Ah quite natural idea present my Madam before you <,> anyway
away <,> and I show some regards to her in different way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#98:1:A>
And <,> uh <w> I've </w> uh my teachers image in me <,> <w> that's
</w> it uh they all play the different one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#99:1:A>
So these three will not come at a time

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#100:1:C>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#101:1:A>
<w> That's </w> why my David is different from the David I
reference before Prakash <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#102:1:B>
Uh that one should not <,> come to know what the other said
of <,> is my said is enough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#103:1:B>
Then the friendship breaks

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#104:1:C>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#105:1:A>
Oh <w> that's </w> what I think <,> what do you say <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#106:1:B>
What do you say Mr David

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#107:1:A>
David has uh many fine experiences in some or other way

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#108:1:C>
Definitely definitely definitely <,> from the fair point of
sex <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#109:1:A>
You tell something about uh David <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#110:1:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#111:1:A>
Yes somewhat you are saying <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#112:1:C>
<}> <-> You need </-> <=> you need </=> </}> that one you
know means that I I should be comfortable with his Endamuri Narayana

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#113:1:A>
No problem <O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#114:1:B>
No problem any Narayan will do <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#115:1:C>
Any Narayan will do for that matter <,> our Narayan will also
do

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#116:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#117:1:C>
He will give somewhat

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#118:1:A>
Or Narayan is there is no <,> he gives different sort of that
altogether

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#119:1:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#120:1:A>
And some here in never

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#121:1:B>
No in fact I was adjusting with that since these but I loved
it <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#122:1:C>
To survive

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#123:1:B>
To survive

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#124:1:A>
To survive

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#125:1:C>
Survival of the fittest he is testing <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#126:1:A>
So this is philosophical touch

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#127:1:B>
Yes it does we have <,> we have told <,,> and uh Mr David
<,,> is going to <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#128:1:A>

You will have to go and search for some seats <,> to sit on it <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#203:1:C>
Yes coming back to Arjuna Nagar this thing <}> <-> what what
</-> <=> what </=> </}> we were discussing <,>

<$A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#205:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#208:1:B>
Ah ah I I met him on the way

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#209:1:A>
Ah yes <}> <-> where </-> <=> where </=> </}> did you meet
him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#210:1:B>
I see

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#211:1:B>
While going to Belgaum <,> he was in the bus

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#212:1:B>
surprise visit

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#213:1:C>
<w> That's </w> quite surprising

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#214:1:B>
Yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh <,> waiting
for Godoth and <,> even Macbeth

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#215:1:C>
I see <,> that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the
time may be <,> <w> you'll </w> listen to his

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#216:1:B>
And this is <,> this is the relevance of this

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#217:1:C>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#218:1:B>
Suppose uh this should be there you know <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#219:1:C>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#220:1:B>
If you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of
<{> <[> the stretch </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#221:1:C>
<[> Know about history </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#222:1:B>
You should have given them situation with your day to day
life and you should refer to the students <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#223:1:C>
Day by day

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#224:1:B>
So that the relevance will be there <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#225:1:C>
There lies the greatness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#226:1:C>
In fact when he is uh <,> dealing with the English literature he
covers Sanskrit literature Kannada literature

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#227:1:A>
Greek literature

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#228:1:C>
Greek literature everything <,> British history everything he
covers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#229:1:C>
It has nothing <,> in fact <,> and <w> that's </w> why

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#230:1:A>
As though

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#231:1:B>
So it was I was unfortunate <,> because I couldn't hear any
lecture from him

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#232:1:A>
Ah ah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#233:1:C>
Yeah definitely correct

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#234:1:C>
<w> That's </w> why we decided uhm to him <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#235:1:B>
Of course he said that he would come <,,> here

<ICE-IND:S1A-017#236:1:B>
When he comes here he will inform us <,> and have a

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#237:1:C>
Yes yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#238:1:B>
<{> <[> Live discussion on </[> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#242:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#243:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#244:1:A>
Ha you wanted to visit many places <,>

Oh once uh <O> laughter </O> <O> a few words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#247:1:C>
Yeah yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-017#248:1:A>
It has become such that the visiting places is the only
business
