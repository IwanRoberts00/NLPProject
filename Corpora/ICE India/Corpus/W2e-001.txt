<h> <bold> A political expedient </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#2:1>
THE Central <w> Government's </w> proposal to provide an
additional five to 10 per cent reservation in jobs for the poor is a
half-hearted and belated concession to the upper castes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#3:1>
While the proposal, announced by Prime Minister V.P.Singh in
Parliament, is welcome, it carries the stigma of political expediency.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#4:1>
At a time when all right-thinking people have veered round to the view
that there should be a national consensus on the entire issue of
reservations, the National Front Government is taking ad-hoc decisions.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#5:1>
When Mr. V.P. Singh announced the <w> Government's </w> decisiion to
implement the Mandal Commission report on August 7, he have rise to criticism
that he was guided by the desire to upstage the dismissed Deputy Prime
Minister Devi Lal, who was busy organising a <w> farmers' </w> rally on
August 9.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#6:1>
That decision, made in utter haste, exposed the populistic
considerations weighing with the Prime Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#7:1>
In the first place, the announcement did not square with the Prime
<w> Minister's </w> oft-declared intention to evolve a consensus on every
national issue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#8:1>
As no political party is against providing reservations for the
disadvantaged sections of society, it would not have been difficult for the
Government to hammer out a consensus on the Mandal Commission report.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#9:1>
It was only when a storm of protest had broken out in many States did
the Prime Minister drop a hint that he was prepared to make appropriate
concessions to the upper castes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#10:1>
One would like to know what had prevented him from evolving a
consensus on the reservation of five to 10 per cent of jobs in the Central
Government and the public sector.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#11:1>
The additional reservation is no more than a sop to the upper castes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#12:1>
The Prime Minister seems to be very much confused on the subject.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#13:1>
On August 8 - - that is, a day after the announcement of the decision
on the Mandal Commission report - - Mr.V.P. Singh said in the <indig> Rajya
Sabha </indig> , somewhat light-heartedly, that since the poor
constituted 40 per cent of the population of India, 40 per cent of the seats
in the legislatures should be reserved for them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#14:1>
If he had really pondered over the issue, he would not have made the
statement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#15:1>
The point is that the Prime Minister is guided more by political
expediency than by anytying else.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#16:1>
Now he must be counting on the additional reservation to defuse the
anti-quota agitations rocking many States.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#17:1>
There is a convention that, when Parliament is in session, all
important decisions of the Government should first be announced in the House.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#18:1>
When the announcement outside Parliament was objected to by the
Opposition, the Prime Minister resorted to semantics by saying that what was
announced was only a proposal and not a decision.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#19:1>
It is clear that he is in a hell of a hurry to do something to
contain the anti-reservation sentiment that is spreading like wild fire.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#20:1>
Surely, this is a case of out of the frying-pan into the fire.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#21:1>
The haphazard manner in which the Government is going about
reservations makes one thing clear: it has no considered stand on the issue.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#22:1>
A solution to the problem seems to lie in a round table to work
out the modalities of implementing the <indig> Mandal </indig> Commission
report, as suggested by BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee in Hyderabad the
other day.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#23:1>
The conference could also consider the additio<I>nal reservation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#24:1>
The Prime Minister cannot be unaware of the Supreme Court ruling that
at no time should the percentage of reservations cross 49.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#25:1>
With the announcement of reservations for backward classes, the job
quotas have already touched 50 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#26:1>
Now is the time for the Government to strive for a consensus on the
issue which has already triggered caste feeling in many parts of the country.

<h> <bold> Violence in the Valley </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#28:2>
That the Kashmiri militants should have stepped up their violent
activities soon after the Kupwara incident in which the Pakistani troops
resorted to heavey artillery shelling against Indian posts is something that
should make the Indian leaders sit up and do something to arrest the perilous
drift in the valley.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#29:2>
The Pakistan-trained subversives have bombed three bridges on the
Srinagar-Leh highway near Srinagar.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#30:2>
And the <indig> jawans </indig> of the Defence <w> Ministry's </w>
Border Road Organisation ( BRO) have become a target for the militants.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#31:2>
With the virtual military take-over in Pakistan, there is a danger of
the <quote> " semi-war" </quote> between India and Pakistan along the line of
Actual Control in Kashmir escalating into a full-scale armed conflict.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#32:2>
The Kashmiri militants are backed to the hilt by Pakistan, whose
President, Mr. Ghulam Isaq Khan, thinks that the Kashmir issue is the
unfinished agenda of Partition.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#33:2>
He is playing second fiddle to the all-powerful Pakistani Army,
which, with a civilian mask, is in virtual control of the country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#34:2>
Pakistani intervention in Kashmir as well as in Punjab still
continues unchecked.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#35:2>
Even during the recent short-lived democratic rule in Pakistan, the
Army persisted in orchestrating the communal strife in the two Indian border
States.
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#> Though the deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto blandly assured
India that her Government was determined to check infiltration of terrorists
from Pakistan into India, the Army cared two hoots for her assurances.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#36:2>
It is strange that the Pakistan-abetted subversion in the two
communally sensitive States of India should have increased after the change
of government in India.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#37:2>
From all this, one cannot help inferring that the political
developments in India are proving to be an irresistible temptation to the
Pakistani Army, which is believed to abound with many elements loyal to the
late President Zia-ul-Haq. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#38:2>
Indeed, the dismissal of the Benazir Government marks the return
of Ziaism.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#39:2>
This has grave implications for India because <w> Zia's </w> phased
plot to plunge Kashmir into communal turmoilnow seems to be at its final
stage.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#40:2>
This must be the reason why the Army has got rid of the elected
Government and installed in its place a puppet regime.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#41:2>
The military manipulators of political power are undoubtedly spoiling
for an armed adventure against India.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#42:2>
This is indicated by the Kupwara clash.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#43:2>
Tension along the Line of Actual Control is mounting and the
subversives from across the border are increasing their attacks on the Indian
security forces.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#44:2>
If this is viewed against the backdrop of the failure of the two
rounds of secretary-level talks between the two countries to yield the
expected results, one can understand the gravity of the situation along the
border.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#45:2>
Pakistan seems fully prepared for a war over the Kashmir issue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#46:2>
Which means India should be able to respond to the Pakistani,
provocations deterrently and decisively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#47:2>
After the Kupwara clash, Prime Minister V.P. Singh spoke of a
graded response to Pakistani aggravation of tension.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#48:2>
But what the situation calls for is something more than a graded
reply.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#49:2>
The motive behind <w> Islamabad's </w> opposition to joint patrolling
of the border is now staring everbody in the face.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#50:2>
If Pakistani intervention continues, India will be justified in
resorting to hot pursuit, even if it means waging a war.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#51:2>
Pakistan has already started such a war.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#52:2>
But the challenge that the militants are posing from within the
Indian territory exposes the <w> Government's </w> monumental failure on
the political front.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#53:2>
The situation would not have come to the present tragic pass if the
National Front Government had refrained from acting vindictively against
the Farooq Abdullah Government. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Plan accent on small units </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#55:3>
THE National Development Council ( NDC) has put its seal of
approval on the approach paper to the Eighth Plan, the main thrust of which
is the removal of poverty and unemployment.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#56:3>
Development of small and tiny industries with an enlarged list of
reserved items will be an important component of the strategy for generation
of employment.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#57:3>
This objective is fully in consonance with the National Front <w>
Government's </w> commitment to make the right to work a Fundamental Right.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#58:3>
Employment generation is the one area where the new Government can
demonstrate its economic dynamism.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#59:3>
Most of the participants in the NDC meeting called for an increase in
the opportunities for self-employment.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#60:3>
The scope for such employment is vast in the rapidly expanding
small-scale sector.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#61:3>
The total investment in the small-scale sector is expected to
increase to 30,000 <indig> crores </indig> in 1994-95 from <indig> Rs.
</indig> 17,015 <indig> crores </indig> at the end of the Seventh Plan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#62:3>
This level of investment, according to a study made by the Federation
of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI), will provide jobs to
6.1 million persons by the end of the Eighth Plan against the employment of
3.4 million at the end of the Seventh Plan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#63:3>
The net addition to employment during the next Plan period will be of
the order of 2.7 million.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#64:3>
It is now realised by all concerned that the promotion and dispersal
of small industrial units will go a long way in solving the unemployment
problem.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#65:3>
But this sector is afflicted with many infirmities.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#66:3>
It is more vulnerable than the medium and major sectors to what is
known as sickness, which is mainly attributable to the non-availability of
working capital when it is needed most.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#67:3>
Pleading with the Central Government to take a fresh look at the
entire gamut of problemes faced by the small and medium sectors, the
All-India <w> Manufacturers' </w> Association ( AIMO) has suggested waiver of
the huge accumulated interest payable by 1.5 <indig> lakh </indig> units in
the two sectors.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#68:3>
Such a step, AIMO feels, will provide employment to about 45 <indig>
lakh </indig> persons immediately. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#69:3>
Consolidation of the progress already made in the small sector
shiould be one of the aims of the strategy outlined in the Eighth Plan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#70:3>
In other words, consolidation and expansion should go hand in
hand.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#71:3>
Realising the employment-generating potential of this sector, the
previous Union Government brought in legislation for the establishment of the
Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI).

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#72:3>
The Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of India (
IDBI), began its operations about two months ago.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#73:3>
One is confident that the SIDBI will play a major role in promoting
and strengthening the small and tiny units.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#74:3>
Marketing continues to be one of the serious problems.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#75:3>
And that problem needs the special attention of the Government,
both at the Centre and in the States.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#76:3>
One complaint that is common to most small entrepreneurs is that the
marketing tie-ups agreed to at the time of starting their units are not
properly adhered to by the Government dpartments and other
quasi-governmental organisations.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#77:3>
Added to this is the short-shrift given to the products of the small
sector in the Southern States by the Directorate General of Supplies and
Disposals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-001#78:3>
There is urgent need for the Central Government undertakings to
rectify the regional imbalances in the quantum of purchases made by them from
the small secotr.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#79:3>
As most of the small entrepreneurs are self-employed, the Government
is under an obligation to help them market their products.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#80:3>
Otherwise, it would be guilty of leaving them in the lurch.

<ICE-IND:W2E-001#81:3>
It would be too much to expect the small and struggling units to
compete with the well-established medium and major industries. </p> </I>
