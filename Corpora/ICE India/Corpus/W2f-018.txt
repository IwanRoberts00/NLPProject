<bold> <&> chapter </&> ONE </bold> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#2:1>
<it> February 11, 1988 </it> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#3:1>
<bold> THE </bold> early morning breeze blowing from across the  
border was brisk and sprayed with the aroma of harvest-ready grain; some  
already harvested. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#4:1>
The night was cool and painful. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#5:1>
The darkness, dissolving into the opaque screen of distant day break,  
was fearful and uncertain. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#6:1>
The Maruti Gypsy, with a canvas top, was clambering listlessly  
towards Khemkaran from Tarn Taran-Patti side. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#7:1>
The stillness of the surroundings was disturbed by the neighing of  
stray horses, tail beating sounds of buffaloes and the tired and reluctant  
barking of scared stray dogs. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#8:1>
The dogs were killed systematically by police and para military  
forces, as well as by the militants. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#9:1>
Dogs cannot be discreet, shout they must at the slightest sound of  
strange movements. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#10:1>
Patrols, pickets, ambushes by police and para military forces were  
favourite targets of these dogs. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#11:1>
Some <indig> jawans </indig> ( constables) and terrorists  
practiced target shooting whenever a dog was sighted. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#12:1>
Pet owners were strictly warned to keep their dogs indoors and  
chained. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#13:1>
The stillness was also disturbed by crackling of the  
radio-telephone set, bursting to life once in a while, carrying  
instructions to patrol and ambush parties. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#14:1>
Another Jeep following the Maruti, was occupied by eight CRPF (  
Central Reserve Police Force ) constables and a Sub-Inspector. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#15:1>
His voice came alive in the radio-set of the Maruti. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#16:1>
<quote> " Zulu, this is Tango - - How far do we go?" </quote>  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#17:1>
Zulu, that is Harkirat Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police,  
smoking away a costly brand of cigarette, gulped down some whisky from a  
quarter bottle, licked his lips and picked up the phone almost disdainfully.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#18:1>
<quote> " Tango, follow me another three kms near the border  
post". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#19:1>
Though a Sikh, Harkirat could not give up smoking, a habit he had  
acquired as a student. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#20:1>
His father was an <indig> Amritdhari </indig> , the one who had been  
baptised and tasted the divine nectar. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#21:1>
The entire family was highly religious. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#22:1>
His wife, Sampuran was an exceptionally pious lady. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#23:1>
Till a few months back, she used to visit the Harimandir ( the Golden  
Temple) almost daily. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#24:1>
Now, the <indig> Gurudwara </indig> was occupied by militants and  
surrounded by <O> <&> page </&> 2 </O> police and security forces. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#25:1>
Another sound which was intermittently disturbing the peace of  
Harkirat and the armed constables was the muffled, broken and nagging cries  
of Surjit, his hands tied at the back, legs tide like that of a turtle and  
eyes and mouth bound by a piece of blood soaked saffron cloth. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#26:1>
Surjit Singh Dalla could now only moan. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#27:1>
He was lying on the modified back floor of the vehicle. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#28:1>
Any movement instantly invited a hit of rifle butt on his buttock and  
shoulder. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#29:1>
Surjit was scared to move. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#30:1>
<quote> " Tango, Zulu here. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#31:1>
We stop now. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#32:1>
Give cover firing to my party, take position behind <indig> sarkanda  
</indig> ( elephant grass) bushes. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#33:1>
My party will proceed with the Cat ( a militant used as a guide)  
towards the BOP ( Border Observation Post)". </quote> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#34:1>
<w> Harkirat's </w> instructions were sharp and crisp. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#35:1>
<quote> " Roger Sir". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#36:1>
The Maruti lumbered along a dirt road for another furlong and  
stopped. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#37:1>
Harkirat jumped out, followed by four constables. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#38:1>
He stood facing west towards the Pakistan border, about two  
furlongs away, covered by high-grown elephant grass, across a deep ditch with  
high earthen banks, locally known as Dhosi bund; in practice, part of defence  
mechanism of the country. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#39:1>
Harkirat lit another cigarette, looked at his watch - - three-thirty  
a.m. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#40:1>
There was no glow of sun-rise in the east. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#41:1>
The day which went down the horizon barely eight hours ago was still  
wrapped up like a dead body. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#42:1>
Harkirat put his hands on his waist, bent backward, did a few  
sideways movements and ordered in a gruffy voice, <quote> " Malkiat, bring  
the bastard out". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#43:1>
Malkiat aligned his Self Loading Rifle ( SLR) in a forward  
assault position and approached the crouched body of Surjit. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#44:1>
He was not sure if it was safe to go near. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#45:1>
Pointing the rifle nozzle towards the robust, haggard and  
blood-splattered mutilated body, Malkiat grumbled <quote> " Fucking idiots,  
God knows from where these insects come". </quote> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#46:1>
He untied the hands and feet of Surjit. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#47:1>
<quote> " Come down you bastard" </quote> Malkiat sounded tired  
but furious. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#48:1>
He also sounded impatient, <quote> " Could not sleep the whole night  
for you, dog". </quote> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#49:1>
His words were soon followed by two kicks. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#50:1>
Malkiat and Ram Prakash, another burly-looking but kidfaced  
constable, straddled up Surjit next to the Maruti. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#51:1>
Opening his eyes, Surjit could not even see the policemen standing  
next to him. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#52:1>
His eyes had been tied for more than four hours. <O> <&> page </&> 3  
</O> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#53:1>
They were bursting out in pain, accompanied by a rhythmic throbbing  
at the temples and eye-balls. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#54:1>
He could perceive only a fleeting rush of different colours, followed  
by darkness. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#55:1>
He tried to stand on his legs. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#56:1>
His trousers were torn at several patches, and the rest of his torso  
was oily and smudged with blood. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#57:1>
Black driplets of bloods were frozen around his nostrils and edges of  
lips. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#58:1>
Though in pain, he inhaled the February chill deeply. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#59:1>
Surjit looked up at Harkirat and the other policemen. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#60:1>
He managed to put together a few words, <quote> " Sir, spare me. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#61:1>
My father is also dead. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#62:1>
We have no other male member in the family". </quote> </p> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#63:1>
<quote> " Fuck your mother", </quote> Harkirat mumbled tersely. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#64:1>
<quote> " Sir, I will give you money. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#65:1>
We will sell the land and give whatever we can", </quote> Surjit  
pleaded. 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#66:1>
<quote> " It is too late. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#67:1>
You ungrateful stupid. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#68:1>
You had the guts of your blighted mother to complain against us to  
the Governor. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#69:1>
What did your fucking father think himself to be! 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#70:1>
Here I am the master. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#71:1>
Things will happen as I say. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#72:1>
You do not live in the forest and fight with the tiger too". </quote>  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#73:1>
Harkirat lit another cigarette, inhaled a lungful of smoke, and  
exhaled in a relaxed manner. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#74:1>
He took out a loaded AK 47 from inside the Maruti, cocked it and  
ordered the constables to take position. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#75:1>
Malkiat, Har Prakash and two others instinctively took to the  
ground in lying position, cocking their SLRs. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#76:1>
Harkirat picked up the radio telephone mouth-piece and spoke in a  
hushed voice, <quote> " Zulu to Tango - - do you get me?" </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#77:1>
<quote> " Zulu, Tango here. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#78:1>
I am getting you O.K". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#79:1>
<quote> " I am going to BOP with the Cat. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#80:1>
I am expecting a group coming in from Pakistan. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#81:1>
Don't open fire till you hear my two whistles". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#82:1>
Harkirat hung up the mouth piece, switched off the radio and  
grabbed Surjit by the hair. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#83:1>
<quote> " Go ahead of me and run when I say. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#84:1>
Only that way you can save your life", </quote> Harkirat smiled  
devilishly. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#85:1>
<quote> " Sir, spare my life", </quote> Surjit again pleaded.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#86:1>
<quote> " I am not going to kill you. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#87:1>
I am giving you a chance, run when I say", </quote> Harkirat  
impatiently tossed the AK 47 from his left palm to right. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#88:1>
Surjit looked towards Harkirat. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#89:1>
The eastern horizon was slightly glowing up. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#90:1>
Arrows of very indistinct purple light were trying to pierce the low  
cloud covers. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#91:1>
A new dawn could perhaps bring new hope. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#92:1>
Surjit looked towards the arrows of <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O> light  
through half closed eyelids. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#93:1>
Harkirat turned <w> Surjit's </w> face towards the Pakistan  
border and snapped <quote> " Go and run when I say". </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#94:1>
Surjit tried to walk, but limped. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#95:1>
He felt a kind of electric current running from his head to his lower  
limbs. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#96:1>
His temple started throbbing again, his heart pounding away loudly  
like a rice-shelling mill. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#97:1>
As he tried to move, images of his mother, father and sister Lajo  
started appearing before his eyes. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#98:1>
He remembered Swapna as well, the daughter of a Hindu civil servant,  
studying in the same course as him at Hindu College, Delhi. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#99:1>
He liked Swapna and dreamt of marrying her one day. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#100:1>
Probably she also liked him. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#101:1>
<quote> " Run, you son of a bitch, run, run, run", </quote>  
Harkirat started shouting. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#102:1>
<w> Surjit's </w> reflexes failed. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#103:1>
His legs did not move. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#104:1>
His whole body froze, as if it was a half-done statue in battered  
rock. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#105:1>
Harkirat emptied the AK 47 magazine, firing a few shots at  
Surjit and scattering the others aimlessly. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#106:1>
He was too drunk to fire straight. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#107:1>
He prostrated himself on the ground a few feet away from the  
slithering body of Surjit and blew a whistle twice. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#108:1>
Hell descended suddenly. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#109:1>
The opaque darkness was pierced by bullets flying from different  
directions. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#110:1>
The BSF ( Border Security Force) observation post, about a  
kilometer towards the north, also opened Light Machine Gun ( LMG) fire,  
punctuated by tracer bullets. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#111:1>
Flashes from the tracers added an errie glow to the ghastly  
scenario. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#112:1>
About 2 kms to the west, the Pakistani <w> Rangers' </w> post also  
started firing LMG bursts towards the Indian BOP. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#113:1>
The madness continued for about ten minutes. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#114:1>
Surjit was hit twice, bullets piercing his leg and thigh  
muscles. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#115:1>
Nobody heard him, but, if the earth and dust could record his voice,  
the replay would have sounded <indig> <quote> " Wahe Guru" </quote> </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#116:1>
Surjit lapsed into coma, bleeding profusely. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#117:1>
Harkirat waited for three minutes, stood up, looked at the body  
of Surjit, kicked it and went to the Maruti in a crouching position. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#118:1>
After switching on the radio set he shouted, <quote> " Zulu here,  
Tango, do you get me?" </quote> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#119:1>
After a brief silence, Tango came on air, <quote> " Yes, Sir. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#120:1>
Is the operation successful?" </quote> </p> 
 
<p> <quote> " No <indig> Yaar </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#121:1>
The Cat was a rogue. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#122:1>
He started running towards the Pak border. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#123:1>
His friends were hiding behind <indig> sarkanda </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#124:1>
They opened fire first. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#125:1>
Did you see the firing from our BOP and from the Pak Rangers? 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#126:1>
Anyway, come here. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#127:1>
We have to make a quick <O> <&> page </&> 5 </O> move, before the  
Pakis open fire again". </quote> 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#128:1>
Harkirat sat down on the ground, lit another cigarette, and looked  
at his wrist watch. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#129:1>
It was about four thirty. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#130:1>
<quote> " Go and pick up the empties", </quote> Harkirat  
commanded his constables. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#131:1>
The CRPF Sub-Inspector turned up with his men, saluted Harkirat  
and waited for orders. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#132:1>
<quote> " Back to Malmandi", </quote> he ordered the contingent  
and took the wheels. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#133:1>
The eastern horizon was now becoming purple and momentarily  
glowing like pale blood splashed on a steel-grey mat. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#134:1>
The low cloud covers were now painted in a riot of colours. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#135:1>
Momentarily, a light golden hue appeared, followed by dusky dimness,  
as another cloud cover obstructed the rays. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#136:1>
Harkirat took another sip of whisky, rinsed and spat out. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#137:1>
He changed the frequency of his radio set and spoke in chaste  
Punjabi, reporting to his detachment headquarters, <quote> " Zulu here,  
reporting to Tiger". </quote> </p>

By the time the Maruti and the Jeep started racing towards their

surrounding village <indig> Gurdwaras </indig> .

Surjit is not the hero of this story. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#157:1>
He was never a hero-type. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#158:1>
Son of a Junior Commissioned Army Officer, Dalbir Singh Dalla, a  
<indig> jat </indig> by caste, Surjit, a six feet four-inches tall, robust,  
handsome, beautiful Aryan-looking young man of nineteen, never considered  
himself a hero. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#159:1>
A young <indig> jat </indig> Sikh from the rural background of Mandi  
Talwandi village, he was brought <O> <&> page </&> 6 </O> up by his mother,  
Satkar Kaur almost as a misfit. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#160:1>
Coming from the family of a junior civil servant of Ludhiana,  
Satkar was forced to adapt to rural life after her marriage. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#161:1>
A graduate in History, Satkar Kaur was married off to an army sepoy  
at the age of twenty one by her step-mother, soon after the death of her  
father, Rajdev, in an accident. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#162:1>
A diabetic, Rajdev Singh Grewal, a Junior Engineer in Canal  
Department, had gone off to his village Kotli for harvesting wheat, locally  
known as <indig> kanak </indig> , literally meaning gold. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#163:1>
Gold surely wheat is to a Punjabi. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#164:1>
Agriculture is the life force of rural <indig> jat </indig> Sikhs  
and harvesting of <indig> kanak </indig> is the culmination of year-long hard  
work. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#165:1>
<indig> Kanak </indig> is grown not by mere combination of  
agro-technological factors; it is grown with the ingredients of sweat,  
blood, feud, village rivalry, murder, court cases and, above all, lots of  
dreams. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#166:1>
Rajdev died following the amputation of two hands in an  
improvised thresher machine, common in Punjab. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#167:1>
A diabetic patient, Rajdev developed gangrene and never recovered.  
</p> 
 
<p> Rajdev could never keep himself away from harvesting wheat. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#168:1>
He was proud of the production of a special variety of <indig>  
Basmati </indig> in his village farm. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#169:1>
The last three monsoons had favoured him and he expected a bumper  
crop that year as well. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#170:1>
But, that particular year, he was not lucky. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#171:1>
This happened around 1966, after the fifth year of his second  
marriage, and exactly on the death anniversary of his first wife, Swaran  
Kaur, mother of Satkar. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#172:1>
Swaran Kaur and Satkar were really not considered lucky for the  
family, as the first child was a girl. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#173:1>
But Rajdev had to live with it. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#174:1>
<w> Satkar's </w> mother had brought some land as dowry. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#175:1>
The daughter of a village school teacher, she struggled with Rajdev  
for ensuring proper education for Satkar. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#176:1>
Rajdev was afraid of her personality. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#177:1>
She gave all the pleasures of life to him, but saw to it that he  
never came home drunk, sat at least twice a day before the Granth Sahibi and  
said his prayers. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#178:1>
Rajdev loved and admired her, but was afraid. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#179:1>
He expected a male child from her and Swaran did die on the  
operation table, while giving pre-mature birth to a still-born male baby.  
</p> 
 
<p> Rajdev was quickly married off to Nirmal Kaur, daughter of a contractor. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#180:1>
She brought dowry of five <indig> acres </indig> of irrigated land. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#181:1>
Fond of good living. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#182:1>
Nirmal Kaur fixed her goals with meticulous sighting. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#183:1>
Not only did Rajdev start coming home drunk, he started inviting  
friends for a few drinks. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#184:1>
A <indig> jat </indig> , as Nirmal Kaur learnt at her contractor <w>  
father's </w> house, was good <O> <&> page </&> 7 </O> for nothing, if he did  
not have a few drinks with chicken <indig> tikkas </indig> ( roasted chicken  
nuggets), and a few extra-marital flings. </p> 
 
<p> Rajdev was happy to have two male children, sure not only of succession,  
but dreaming of expanding his land holdings in the coming years. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#185:1>
After all, he had two inheritors to take care of the land. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#186:1>
Nirmal married off Satkar as soon as she passed her B.A. with  
Honors in History, to Sepoy Dalbir Singh Dalla; whose family had migrated to  
Mandi Talwandi from Dera Ghazi Khan, after Partition. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#187:1>
Son of a Border Ranger in North West Frontier Province, Dalbir  
combined in him the dual characterstics of a <indig> jat </indig> , love for  
uniform and land. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-018#188:1>
Satkar was disillusioned with her married life. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#189:1>
Dalbir, mostly out on posting to fronts and other stations, left her  
alone to take care of his landed property, buffaloes, tractor and two  
children. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#190:1>
Surjit and his lovely sister Lajo, formally christened Amrita. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#191:1>
An educated woman, Satkar initially toyed with the idea of teaching  
in a local school. 

<ICE-IND:W2F-018#192:1>
Socially there was no problem, but, like a tree encircled by  
creepers and vines, she preferred to hold on to <w> Dalbir's </w> family, as  
a good wife, mother and family guardian. </p> </I>
