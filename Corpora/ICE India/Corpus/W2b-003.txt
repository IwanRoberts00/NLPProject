<h> <bold> OMAR <w> KHAYYAM'S </w> CRITICISM OF LIFE </bold> </h> <O>
<&> author </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#2:1>
Dr. C.R. REDDI </O> <&> in two columns </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#3:1>
Omar khayyam was born in the latter half of the 11th century and
died in the first quarter of the 12th.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#4:1>
For a man of the 11th century, Khayyam is strangely modern.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#5:1>
He was a scientist of no ordinary worth of distinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#6:1>
His work entitled <quote> " Algebra " </quote> was translated into
some of the European languages.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#7:1>
As an astronomer he was amongst the foremost of the Middle Ages and
the Christian calendar of the present day owes much of its perfection to
his labours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#8:1>
Not satisfied with being a scientist, he wanted to be a philosopher -
- the solver of <w> life's </w> mighty riddle - - with disastrous results to
his peace of mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#9:1>
<it> <quote> " Up from <w> Earth's </w> centre through the Seventh
gate I rose and on the throne of Saturn sate and many a knot unravelled by
the Road; but not the master - knot of Human death and fate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#10:1>
There was the door to which I found no key </it> . " </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#11:1>
He was too naughty a spirit to find consolation in faith and
resignation, the unfailing resources of the meek and humble.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#12:1>
Supremely endowed with courage and audacity, he did battle with
the orthodoxy of his days.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#13:1>
He sneered at the mystical <indig> Sufis </indig> as a loquacious
lot.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#14:1>
He was not given the Robe of Honour, which his genious deserved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#15:1>
He laughs, saying that it could only be purchased by bartering away
his freedom of thought; certainly He is the richer by keeping the more
precious stuff for himself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#16:1>
Like Mill and Morley of contemporary history, he was a sage and
sceptic rolled into one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#17:1>
High office did not tempt him.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#18:1>
He preferred instead a pension coupled with the pleasures and
pursuits of private life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#19:1>
The thoughts and feelings he expresses are astonishingly and
surprisingly modern.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#20:1>
There is not a single writer of the Middle Ages who has caught the
fancy of the present day in such a close and mighty grip as Omar.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#21:1>
One may not like him - - his views may be abhorrent to you - - but if
there is any the least spark of serious intellectual purpose in your life
he seizes on your attention.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#22:1>
He has the glittering eye of the Ancient Mariner and fascinates
while perturbing the guest bent on attending the feast of faith.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#23:1>
<w> Fitzgerald's </w> rendering of the <foreign> Rubaiyat
</foreign> has become a classic - - a leading classic in the literature of
revolt - - of revolt against accepted doctrines of human worth and destiny.
</p> <O> <&> page </&> 15 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#24:1>
Khayyam can never become obsolete because the theme of his song
belongs to the eternal element in the heart.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#25:1>
Feeling minds and thinking heads will ask these questions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#26:1>
<quote> " What is truth? said jesting Pilate and would not stay for
an answer" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#27:1>
Probably <}> <-> be </-> <+> he </+> </}> knew it was no use waiting
for an answer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#28:1>
But Pilate has left plenty of successors, more patient than he, and
in consequence more miserable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#29:1>
I shall briefly summarise the considerations that led Omar to
deny the divine ordering of the world : </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#30:1>
<h> <bold> 1. Intellectual despair </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#31:1>
In his youth he frequented doctor and saint and heard great
argument about it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#32:1>
<it> ( It never is, on it I am afraid ) but every more came out by
the same door as I went in </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#33:1>
Great scientist as he was, he found it easier to solve the riddle
of the material world rather than the spiritual.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#34:1>
To his questioning there came not answer from the world without,
nor yet from the world within.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#35:1>
<it> <quote> " And I heard, as from without, the Me within thee is
blind" </quote> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#36:1>
What then were the questions that perplexed him ? </p> <&> verses
begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#37:1>
<quote> <it> " Into this Universe and why not knowing Nor whence,
like water willy nilly flowing And out of it, as wind along the waste I know
not whither willy-nilly blowing." </it> </quote> </p> <&> verses end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#38:1>
Moreover he asks, <mention> Was I consulted by the Power that
thus arrogated to itself the function of disposing my destinies?
</mention> </p> <&> verses begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#39:1>
<it> <quote> <+> " </+> What without asking, hither hurried whence ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#40:1>
And without asking, whither hurried hence !

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#41:1>
Despair is own cousin to blind fury and rage" </quote> </it> </p> <&>
verses end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#42:1>
He adds : </p> <&> verses begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#43:1>
<it> <quote> " In many a cup of this forbidden wine

<quote> <+> " </+> Shall I seek for tempral good or for eternal
happiness ? the answer is the same to both : your reward is neither here nor
there." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#46:1>
It will be observed that Omar parts company with Kantian ethics
and the generally accepted theological views.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#47:1>
According to these ethical codes imperfection pertains only to this
world, and strangely enough, it is a fine reason for believing in the
existence and perfection of a heavenly kingdom.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#48:1>
The answer of Omar is clear though rude.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#49:1>
He asks <it> <mention> Who made this world? </mention> </it>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#50:1>
In his parable of the pot and the potter he makes one of the pots
say. </p> <&> verses begin </&>

<it> <quote> " They sneer at me for leaving all things awry </it>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#52:1>
Why did the hand then of the potter shake" </quote> . <&> verses end
</&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#53:1>
If the hand shook in making this world, why should we suppose it
to have been steady in making that other world ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#54:1>
The results is he gives up asking these questions. </p> <&>
verses begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#55:1>
<it> <quote> " <w> Perplex't </w> no more with human or divine

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#57:1>
This is more often attempted than achieved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#58:1>
In point of fact he did worry himself with problems which were most
heart-breaking. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 16 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#59:1>
We have already seen that Omar khayyam was alive to the problem
of evil - - more especially as a wrong and injustice done to his own
personality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#60:1>
Look, he says, how all is vanity ! </p> <&> verses begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#68:1>
Moreover such is life, that no one wants to be reborn here.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#69:1>
It is a sufficient verdict on its loathsome futility: Both the
good and the bad. </p> <&> verses begin </&>

You may have been a hero, but once dead, what is left of you ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#73:1>
Shakespeare dwelt gloomily on the probability of Imperial Caesar dead
and turned to clay being utilised by a most prosale housewife for stopping a
chink in the wall.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#74:1>
In similar strain sings Omar. </p> <&> verses begin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#84:1>
It is the man of shallow sense and morbid impulses that looks on
a revolt like this as the result of pride or frivolity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#85:1>
There is in it as fine and deep a feeling of moral obligation and as
profound an insight into moral worth as was displayed by the saints of sacred
calendars, by a St. Francis or a Buddha. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#86:1>
Povidence being out of the question, what else is there to
afford us a rational ground of explanation ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#87:1>
Destiny, hard, cold, inevitable and inexorable - - a view not
dissimilar to that propounded by Lucretius and accepted by the science of
today as the only possible hypothesis. </p> <&> verses begin </&>

The only religion that wholeheartedly accepts the supremacy of
natural law is Himduism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#92:1>
Pantheism has its insoluble difficulties - - but theoretical
absurdities are not part of its <O> <&> page </&> 17 </O> sacred repertoire.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#93:1>
Would Omar have been a Hindu ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#94:1>
Probably, but the conclusions he would have drawn from the identity
of God with nature would have scared the orthodox Hindu into fits.

That is so far as human conduct and yearnings go, we are left to

But, of course, this is better than to be under a regime where you

No, he says, the Idea is of no importance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#103:1>
The world goes on heedless of his coming and departure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#104:1>
Observe how similar the views of Athiests and Thiests are so far.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#105:1>
The sentiments above expressed may have been those of a devout monk
or nun; It is when they draw their conclusions or assign causes to the events
described that they part company and go their opposite ways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-003#106:1>
Omar denies human responsibility for this wretched state of
affairs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#107:1>
It is either God or Destiny.

<ICE-IND:W2B-003#108:1>
He hopes it is not the former, as in that case be will have to form
a low estimate of His power or benevolence.

It is absurd for God who made man sinful to expect him to be
