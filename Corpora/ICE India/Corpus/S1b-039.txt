<ICE-IND:S1B-039#1:1:A>
Mr Boris Yeltsin <,,> of Russia <,> had an extremely successful
visit to India last week <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#2:1:A>
And such were <,> the <O> one word </O> reception he got in the
central hall of Praliament when he addressed that <,> August body <,> that
people were asking whether he is <,> more popular in India <,> than he is
back in Russia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#3:1:A>
During his visit he signed ten agreements <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#4:1:A>
And it appeared <,> that the old relationship <,> between India and
the Soviet Union <,> which has collapsed <,> with that counrty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#5:1:A>
Now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new Russia <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#6:1:A>
Now obviously Russia is not the Soviet Union <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#7:1:A>
<w> India's </w> relationship with Russia <,> has to be on a new
basis <,> uh completely different basis <,> from that with the old Soviet
Union <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#8:1:A>
To discuss this we have with us <,> two distinguished panelist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#9:1:A>
They are <,> Mr Jagjeet Singh who is <,> the director of the
Institute <,> for Defence Studies and Analysis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#10:1:A>
We have Mr Vijay Karan <,> former Director of the CBI <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#11:1:A>
Jagjeet <,> tell us over all in the <}> <-> <.> ter te </.> </->
<=> terms </=> </}> of structuring a new relationship between the two
countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#12:1:A>
In terms of the totality of the vision <,> where do you think we
stand with Russia <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#13:1:A>
And how is this different from the old relationship with the Soviet
Union <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#14:1:B>
Well I think <,> obviously as you mentioned very rightly <}>
<-> <.> tha </.> </-> <=> that </=> </}> there is something we also need to
keep reminding ourselves that there is no Soviet Union <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#15:1:B>
Uh this is uh <,> not totally a new country but substantively <,>
new leadership <,> new system new approaches <,> have <,> and which has <?>
substantial </?> amount of domestic problems the economic social political
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#16:1:B>
Uh <,> in the larger context of course it remains one of the <,>
key <,> uh great powers of the world <,> much depends on how <,> <w> it's
</w> own <,> cohesiveness in all respects shapes up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#17:1:B>
Uh but what what would have imagined uh Swami that <,> uh given the
nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people
still are similar <,> and <-> the </-> some fundemental <,> uh
geo-political realities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#18:1:B>
In fact this <,> sort of visit should have taken place much earlier

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#19:1:B>
But still I think uh uhm <,> coming as it does it is time <,> does
reflect hopes return to realism in Moscow <,> as well as a certain amount of
<,> fresh thinking on both sides to <,> to look at this relationship and try
to build it up <,> uh with the changed circumstances on the changed
parametres <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#20:1:A>
Yes in fact I think <,> the internal affairs ministry <,> had
made an official announcement about Boris Yeltsin coming almost one year ago

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#21:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#22:1:A>
And he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#23:1:A>
And I think a very large number of people had come to the
conclusion <,> <quote> look this is a terrible mistake <,> Mr Boris Yeltsin
<,> no longer heads a super power <,> he now head merely <,> a poor country
<,> and a <O> one word </O> of Europe </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#24:1:A>
That his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other
systems as he can get <,> from the USA <,> from Europe <,> investment if he
can from Japan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#25:1:A>
And that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish
himself with the West <,> and Japan <,> and that he is no longer going to
worry about old geo-political <,> strategy which made India a national
ally of the Soviet Union <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#26:1:A>
And yes now that he has come <,> in a sense people are once again
<,> getting a whip of old nostalgia saying <,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig>
<,> that even if <w> it's </w> not quite <,> the same love affair can we
atleast hold hand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#27:1:A>
Uh Mr Vijay Karan how do you see this new affair <,> developing
<,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#28:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#29:1:C>
Well I agree with you there were <,> there was a state of
uncertainty before he came because <,> of the announcement that he will come
earlier but he didn't come <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#30:1:C>
At least that uncertainty has been <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=>
removed </=> </}> <,> and his visit has shown <,,> a certain <,> degree of
keenness on the part of the Russian to <,> continue good relations with India

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#31:1:C>
Otherwise I doubt them first <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#32:1:C>
The Russians would have been so forth the Russian President for
instance <,> so forth right on <,> <w> India's </w> territorial integrity on
<,,> the Kashmir on <,> Pakistan etcetera

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#33:1:C>
So I think <,> also I would rather take the first step <,> Russia
when you think in terms of uh <,> may be uh <,> another regional grouping in
in the long term <,> if it <,> <O> one word </O> off

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#34:1:C>
The emerges of any other threat in Islamic law <,> emerging in the
<O> one word </O> in the horizon <,> or the western powers again there are
some problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#35:1:C>
So may be <,> they <}> <-> wants </-> <+> want </+> </}> to keep
India on the right side you know good relationship India <,,> a good
relationship with India as as a long term measure <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#36:1:A>
It is interesting point <w> you're </w> raising <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#37:1:A>
Alright suppose Russia feels some kind of threat from an Islamic
block <,> what role would it expect India to play then <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#38:1:C>
Well <,,> may be if <,> <w> let's </w> say an Islamic block
emerges <,> and it it becomes <?> enemical </?> to India <,> because of say
Pakistan <,> or Bangladesh or together they

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#39:1:C>
Otherwise I do not see an Islamic block <,> really <,> posing a
serious threat to India

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#40:1:C>
But because of Pakistan and Bangladesh <,> if it poses a threat to
India <,> and if it also poses a threat to Russia <,> than there are there is
we can do something <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#41:1:A>
Jagjeet do you think I mean <,> there was an old <}> <-> <.>
ge </.> </-> <=> geo-political </=> </}> relationship based on <,,> the USSR
as a global power <,> <{> <[> yes <,> actually Russia is not a global power
<,> and yet there is a point which Vijay has just said about <,,> the
potential of trouble in <,> Central Asia <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#42:1:A>
Uh which is an area <,,> which so to speak divide Russia <,> from
India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#43:1:A>
Do you think this have a serious issue <,> uh which has agitating
minds in Moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#44:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#45:1:B>
Uhm <,> well yes and <}> <-> <.> n n </.> </-> <=> no </=>
</}> in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about
Central Asia <,> uh <w> let's </w> say about a year ago in Moscow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#46:1:B>
Uh but I don't think <w> that's </w> the reason for <,> uh the <,>
type of <,> attempt to build up a new relationship

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#47:1:B>
It is perhaps just one more factor in that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#48:1:B>
Uh the <,> the fundamental has not really change <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#49:1:B>
Russia <,,> in fact they are not <O> one or two words </O> global
power just any way <,> except the United States

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#50:1:B>
From from their point of view especially particularly in that
respect so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#51:1:B>
Uh that way it is not <,> too difficult to look at Russia <,> uh
more in the nature of uhm another great country <,> uh great <,> power <,>
whatever terms you want to use it <,> which has <,> not only its own interest
but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of <,> uh centres of
powers and <,> areas and regions <,> uh then just Japan uh North America and
and West Europe <,> and <w> that's </w> realism I was talking of

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#52:1:B>
That there is a return to realism <,> which then uh <,> makes the
whole thing possible to establish a new relationship <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#53:1:B>
Central Asia is certainly an important point <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#54:1:B>
But not that that <w> that's </w> the driving force <,> I I won't
say <w> it's </w> the driving force <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#55:1:C>
Well <,> I said that because I think the Russian President did
mentioned that <,,> <quote> may be <,> Russia China and India could emerge as
a force together and could work together </quote> <w> that's </w> what he
mentioned in the press conference

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#56:1:A>
Well much depend that <O> one word </O> certain significant
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#57:1:B>
<w> You'll </w> know that the number of people who were very
upset in India <,,> with the end of the cold war threat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#58:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> now be in a uni-polar world <,> dominated by the USA
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#59:1:B>
Alas <}> <-> <.> Rus </.> </-> <=> the Soviet Union </=> </}> is no
more <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#60:1:B>
Some of the thing to be getting excited about Russia I think <,> or
perhaps <,> we will no longer be a uni-polar world perhaps <w> we'll </w> be
able to use Russia or some other people <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#61:1:A>
Ally with them <,> or with <w> you're </w> searching a broader
<,> group along with China <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#62:1:A>
But does it <,> is is that realistic <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#63:1:A>
I mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#64:1:A>
I mean I don't think the world is really uni-polar <{> <[> but
clear </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#65:1:A>
<[> To the extent </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#66:1:B>
Right to the extent that the <,> the USA is substantial <.>
doc </.> uh if not <,> do not completely dominant power <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#67:1:A>
Do you think <,> Russia <,,> can be used by us in any sense
<,> to break whatever <,> dominancy USA may have <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#68:1:B>
Well first of all uh uh as <w> you've </w> said <,> I mean <w>
I'm </w> one of the people who believes that there was never this thing
called a uni-polar <,> world

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#69:1:A>
I <O> one or two words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#70:1:B>
Except the United States always <,> always even during the
cold war <,> held the primacy amongst states and that primacy continues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#71:1:B>
And the question was Soviet Union has uh created a capability
mostly military <,> to countervail that that one

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#72:1:B>
So <w> that's </w> one that has disappeared <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#73:1:B>
What he take the military power and the balance of power
unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#74:1:B>
Once you take that factor away <,> then you will start looking at
the <,> uh strategic and security economic political interest of states <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#75:1:B>
Uh I personally if I think which which <w> we're </w> which mean
inclined to look at this issue from the point of view <,> can we use <,> a
country <-> of </-> against different country

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#76:1:B>
I I think <,> there are natural <,> areas on which co-operation
will take place <,> whether the scope of co-operation is greater <,> let us
say between Russia and India <,> than it could be between <?> Aryo </?> -
Russia and United States or India and the United States <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#77:1:B>
Uh if the <,> the whole uh thing is there is <,> in a way <,> uh
you know prosperity has become <,> one of the new <,> urgent necessity
throughout the world in Russia and India and <,> in whole of Asia <,> and
even in the United States for that matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#78:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> been altering the <,> the whole structure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#79:1:B>
I think that we need to look at the whole situation <,> more in
terms of areas on which co-operation will continue <,> and areas on which <}>
<-> they </-> <+> there </+> </}> will be differences of opinion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#80:1:B>
Our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of
co-operation whether it is United States or with Russia or China or Japan or
whatever <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#81:1:B>
And to ensure that the areas of differences <,> or divergences <,>
<}> <-> do not </-> <=> are not </=> </}> allowed to become <,> uh sources of
controversial matter <w> that's that's </w> the only way <-> of </-> I look
at it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#82:1:A>
Yes fine

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#83:1:A>
I mean as <w> it's </w> very <,> very clear that <,> there is no
sense in which India <,> can aligned itself with Russia against the USA

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#84:1:A>
I mean Jagjeet has gone out of his way to say <,> any friendship
<w> we've </w> is not <{> <[> you </[> can not be aimed against anybody else
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#85:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#86:1:A>
Okay lets get to some nuts and bolt <,> of <,> the agreement
signed here and of the specific policy statements <,> made by Yelstin here
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#87:1:A>
The obvious one is Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#88:1:A>
Earlier there was <,> considerable uncertainty as to what was going
to be <w> Russia's </w> new position <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#89:1:A>
We had even indicated if <w> I'm </w> not mistaken sometime ago <->
are </-> <quote> don't expect that we shall continue <,> what the Soviet
Union use to do </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#90:1:A>
And yet it would appear <,> during his visit here <,> unambiguously
came out <,> with support to the Indian position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#91:1:A>
Two questions <,> first does it make any difference <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#92:1:A>
In other words <,> given that <,> the USA has given <O> one word
</O> to <w> India's </w> position various other <,> all security council were
driven to <w> India's </w> position <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#93:1:A>
Does it really make much of a difference <,> that Mr Yelstin has
<,,> <O> one word </O> around to <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#94:1:A>
Question question number two <,> uh since this is clearly a message
in trying to get through to us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#95:1:A>
What is their willingness <,,> which take the climate which we can
capitalize on <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#96:1:A>
Mr Vijay Karan

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#97:1:C>
Yeah <,> I think that <,,> the first question that is about uh
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#98:1:A>
Doesn't matter

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#99:1:C>
Uhm the fact matter because <,> you can't uh wish away I mean
the Soviet Union <,> is not irrelevent I mean <w> it's </w> <,> one mustn't
obtained that after the break up of the Soviet Union <,> Russia has become
irrelevent

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#100:1:C>
As you mentioned <w> it's </w> still a strong military power <,>
because as member of the United <,> uh Security Council <,> that does count
in the world

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#101:1:C>
It might be weak economically

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#102:1:C>
<{> <[> <O> A few words </O> </[> <w> it's </w> own problem

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#103:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#104:1:C>
And uh apart from <,> the Russian <,> the American <,> the
American question is there on <,> what they want from Pakistan for instance

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#105:1:C>
Pakistan has <,> I mean <}> <-> <.> U </.> </-> <=> USA </=> </}>
has sent a signal to <.> Pakis </.> a clear signal to Pakistan on terrorism
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#106:1:C>
If a similar signal can go <}> <-> from the <.> Sovi </.> </-> <=>
from Russia </=> </}> to <,> Pakistan

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#107:1:C>
<w> That's </w> <O> a few words </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-039#108:1:A>
Yes it is good <,> uh I think we need to move on to <,> <O>
one word </O> somewhere to centre pace <,> of the visit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#109:1:A>
This should be the resolution of the <indig> rupee </indig>
<foreign> rubel </foreign> dispute between the two countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#110:1:A>
And I think if this had not been resolved <,,> co-operation and
trade co-operation <,> military measures would have been held up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#111:1:A>
And this is such a complex affair <,> that it might be a mistake
to get too deeply into it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#112:1:A>
But as I understand this extremely complex affair <,,> roughly
twenty percent <,,> uh of the increase in the <indig> rupee </indig> value
which should have taken place after <,> December thirty first nineteen
ninety-one <,> has not taken place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#113:1:A>
To that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the
debt which nobody is talking about <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#114:1:A>
<O> One word </O> were given not talked about <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#115:1:A>
Of the debt that remains <,> roughly one third has been <?>
reschedule </?> <,> on extremly softer terms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#116:1:A>
Where our debt servicing liability comes down <,> by about two
third <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-039#117:1:A>
This has been held as an arrangement <,> that is fair to all and
<,> will arrange will enable our <,,> bilateral relations now to go ahead on
the trade side <,> on the credit side <,> on the defence side <,> </I>
