<bold> Gamma-ray astronomy has a strong bearing on the origin of
cosmic radiation, a problem that is not solved as yet despite intensive
research for the past seven decades </bold> </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps>COSMIC</smallcaps> </bold> rays are tiny visitors
from outer space that constantly keep impinging on the <w> earth's </w>
atmosphere from all directions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#5:1>
They comprise a host of highly energetic particles including protons,
nuclei of heavier atoms, electrons, positrons and also gamma ray photons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#6:1>
Neutrions, which are supposed to be chargeless and massless
particles, predominate over all other particles by several orders of
magnitude but their energies are mainly low and it is extremely difficult to
detect them experimentally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#7:1>
The study of cosmic rays is important because it has a strong
influence on the terrestrial atmosphere, especially in the production
of very high intensity radiation belts around the earth and ionisation in the
lower atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#8:1>
It also plays an important role in genetic mutations which may have
influenced the course of organic evolution on the earth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#9:1>
Although cosmic rays were discovered in 1912, through the <O>
photograph in the middle of page </O> <O> caption </O> pioneering balloon
experiments of the German scientist Victor F. Hess, all attempts to date
aimed at locating the sources of these particles have failed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#10:1>
It was initially thought that the study of the directions from which
cosmic rays arrive would enable us to localize the sources of these energetic
particles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#11:1>
But it was later discovered that the matter was not so simple.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#12:1>
It was found that cosmic ray particles are affected by galactic
magnetic field which changes their direction of arrival on earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#13:1>
So the arrival direction at earth does not bear any relation with the
actual source direction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#14:1>
Very low-energy cosmic ray particles are not greatly affected by
galactic magnetic field, but their level is so low that the available
statistics does not allow a meaningful search for localized regions of
emission.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#15:1>
It is precisely because of these reasons that even major cosmic ray
experiments involving detectors with effective sizes of several square
kilometres have failed to pinpoint any source of cosmic rays either within
our galaxy or outside in the extragalactic space. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#16:1>
The first problem one encounters in <O> <&> page </&> 21 </O> the
search for the origin of cosmic rays involves deciding whether this
radiation arises within our Milky Way galaxy ( also called the Galaxy,
of which our solar system is a part) or has its sources outside.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#17:1>
The detection of radio synchrotron radiation, produced by the
interaction of cosmic ray electrons with the galactic magnetic field,
supernova remnants, pulsars, etc., indicates that cosmic ray electrons are
mainly of Galactic origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#18:1>
The same argument, however, does not apply in the case of cosmic
ray nuclei as no definite Galactic source of protons and nuclei has been
discovered so far.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#19:1>
This situation appears to have changed to some extent with the recent
results obtained from gamma-ray astronomy which suggest that several
Galactic sources of high-energy protons and nuclei may have been discovered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#20:1>
Probably the best method of distinguishing between a Galactic and
an extra-Galactic origin for cosmic rays is to search for what is called a
<quote> " radical cosmic ray density gradient" </quote> , which is
expected to be significant if cosmic rays originate within the Galaxy.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#21:1>
<bold> <smallcaps>GAMMA</smallcaps> </bold> ray astronomy provides
a reasonable accurate method of deriving the radial cosmic ray density
gradient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#22:1>
High-energy gamma rays, with energy in the MeV ( Million electron
volt ) - GeV ( Giga electron volt ) range, are believed to result from the
decay of ( pi)mesons produced in the interactions of cosmic ray protons with
interstellar matter which essentially comprises atomic and molecular
hydrogen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#23:1>
Cosmic gamma-ray data obtained with satellite-borne detectors,
like those flown on the SAS - - II ( Small Astronomy Satellite ) and the
COS-B ( Cosmic Ray Satellite ) satellites can be used to give a radial
distribution from which the cosmic ray distribution within the galaxy can be
computed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#24:1>
Inspite of some limitations inherent in this procedure, a detailed
<O> sketch in middle of page </O> <O> caption </O> analysis of satellite
gamma-ray data has shown the presence of a significant cosmic ray radial
density gradient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#25:1>
This indicates that the bulk of cosmic rays, or at least those which
are responsible for the generation of gamma-ray in the MeV-GeV energy range,
are galactic in origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#26:1>
However, this procedure does not provide any indication of specific
cosmic ray sources, a subject on which information is again sought through
gamma-ray observations, though, at higher energies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#27:1>
There is an intimate connection between cosmic gamma-ray
studies and the problem of cosmic ray origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#28:1>
It is generally believed that high-energy gamma-rays result from the
interactions of energetic charged particles with the electromagnetic
fields and matter pervading the inter-stellar medium, the dominant
processes being <*> pie </*> decay, synchrotron process and inverse
compton effect, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#29:1>
Due to their high penetrating power and charge neutrality, cosmic
gamma-rays can arrive at the earth from almost any part of the Galaxy without
any appreciable absorption and without any deflection in the galactic
magnetic field.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#30:1>
This opens up the possibility of the detection of discrete sources
of gamma-rays by employing suitable experimental techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#31:1>
As gamma-ray sources must also produce copious amounts of
energetic charged particles, the detection of such sources provides the
only method to identify discrete sources of cosmic rays.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#32:1>
It is mainly because of this promise that a <}> <->
lost</-><+>lot</+> </}> of attention has been paid to very high-energy cosmic
gamma-ray astronomy during the last two decades or <O> <&> page </&> 22
</O> so and some very important results have been obtained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#33:1>
<bold> <smallcaps>APART</smallcaps> </bold> from satellite-borne
detectors, which detect energetic gamma-rays directly, two ground-based
techniques have also been developed for gamma-ray astronomy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#34:1>
These are the atmospheric Cerenkov technique and the air shower array
technique, which can detect gamma-rays of energy ranging from 10<sp>11</sp>
to 10<sp>14</sp> eV and above.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#35:1>
In both the methods, the <w> earth's </w> atmosphere is used as an
energy transducer <O> photograph spread over 2 1/2 columns </O> <O> caption
</O> wherein the primary photon or nucleon energy is converted into a cascade
of electrons, positrons, muons, hadrons and photons, etc, through a series of
interactions ( Fig.2).

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#36:1>
At primary energies greater than 10<sp>14</sp> eV, most of the
secondary particles survive absorpotion in the atmosphere and can be detected
at high altitudes by employing a widely disposed array of particle detectors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#37:1>
The difference in the relative arrival times of the particles at the
various detectors can be used to derive the direction of the primary cosmic
ray particles with reasonable accuracy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#38:1>
Identification of potential cosmic ray sources is then sought by
looking for anisotropies in the arrival directions and by conducting
detailed investigations of the source regions at other wavelength bands
of the magnetic spectrum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#39:1>
As they move through the atmosphere the primary particles produce
secondary particles in a process called <quote> ` air shower' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#40:1>
These particles lose a part of their energy through the Cerenkov
process.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#41:1>
The visible photons thus produced mainly in the wavelength band
300-5000 A can be detected at the ground level as narrow pulses with suitable
mirror-photomulti-plier tube systems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#42:1>
This provides an efficient method of detecting 10<sp>11</sp> -
10<sp>14</sp> eV cosmic ray primaries at ground.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#43:1>
This so-called atmospheric Cerenkov technique has been used
extensively for cosmic gamma-ray studies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#44:1>
The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has been operating such a system
at Gulmarg ( Kashmir).

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#45:1>
A similar though larger system has been operated by the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research at Ooty for several years and has now been
shifted to Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#46:1>
However, these techniques are unable to distinguish between
extensive air shower events initiated by primary cosmic ray particles and
those produced by gamma-rays.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#47:1>
The principal characteristics of the two types of showers are
essentially identical and it poses a real challenge to separate the extremely
small gamma ray signal from the rather overwhelming background of the
charged particle initiated events.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#48:1>
Several techniques, based on the subtle though experimentally
distinguishable differences between the two types of showers have been tried
with moderate success. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#49:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> DURING </smallcaps> </bold> the last twenty years
or so, gamma-ray astronomy studies in the Very High Energy ( VHE =
10<sp>11</sp> - 10<sp>13</sp> eV ) and the Ultra High Energy ( UHE =
10<sp>14</sp> - 10<sp>17</sp> eV) bands using ground-based techniques have
identified a number of potential, discrete cosmic ray sources in the
Galaxy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#50:1>
These <quote> ` sources' </quote> represent two distinct types of
stellar populations, namely isolated fast pulsars and binary x-ray sources
involving compact primaries ( like black holes, neutron stars, and white
dwarfs ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#51:1>
A distinguishing feature of the observed gamma-ray emission from
these <quote> ` sources' </quote> is the variability of the emission and
the modulation of the gamma-ray signal with a period characteristic of the
system, viz., the rotation period in the case of pulsars and the orbital
period in the case of binary x-ray source.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#52:1>
While <O> ( Continued on page 38) </O> <O> <&> page </&> 23 </O> <O>
continued from page 23 </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#53:1>
<h> <bold> GAMMA-RAY ASTRONOMY </bold> </h> </O> the Crab pulsar (
PSR0531 + 21) and the Vela pulsar ( PSR 0833 - 45) represent typical examples
of the first type, the binary x-ray sources Cygnus X-3, Her X - 1 and Vela X
- 1 represent typical examples of the second type of the galactic gamma-ray
emitting objects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#54:1>
In addition to these five sources, a number of pulsars, x-ray
binary systems and extragalactic objects ( like the radio galaxy Cen-A)
have also been reported by at least one observatory to emit VHE and UHE
gamma-ray signals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-023#55:1>
It would be in order to sound a note of caution at this stage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#56:1>
The high-energy cosmic rays that are presently observed at the earth
are probably unrelated to any of the VHE and UHE gamma-ray sources discussed
so far.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#57:1>
The magnetic field of the Galaxy prevents their direct journey from
the source to the observer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#58:1>
The propagation of UHE / VHE cosmic rays through the Galaxy is a
diffusive process which takes much longer than the life-time of any of the
sources discovered so far.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#59:1>
Cosmic ray production in this scenario is a dynamic process with many
sources contributing at any time for comparatively brief epochs during their
evolution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#60:1>
It may be kept in mind, though, that the nature of the primary
particle detected in UHE / VHE gamma-ray astronomy is uncertain at present
and only follows from a process of elimination of all other possibilities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-023#61:1>
Better and bigger experiments in future, incorporating systems for an
unambiguous identification of the primary particle, will go a long way in
pinpointing the exact sources of cosmic rays and thus help in the
understanding of the fundamental problems of cosmic ray acceleration and
propagation. </p> <*> line below </*> <&> Note on Authors </&>
