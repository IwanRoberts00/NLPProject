<I> <O> Q.3 ( b) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#1:1>
<mention> Abstruction </mention> means to deduce or to <}> <->
summerise. </-> <+> summarise. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#2:1>
Scientists always want to find out the cause & effect relationship
that <}> <-> Governs </-> <+> governs </+> </}> the nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#3:1>
In <}> <-> old </-> <+> olden </+> </}> days people assumed that
there is some super-natural power that governs the all <}> <-> happening </->
<+> happenings </+> </}> in the nature & nature is abstract.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#4:1>
But <}> <-> scientist </-> <+> scientists </+> </}> strongly
oppose this statement.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#5:1>
They <}> <-> says </-> <+> say </+> </}> nature is real understandable

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#6:1>
There are certain laws governing the natural phenomena. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#7:1>
There are certain regularities & irregularities in the nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#8:1>
Scientists <+> are </+> attracted towards simlarities &
dissimilarities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#9:1>
They want to find out the <del> ch </del> exact cause & effect
relationship of the natural happenings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#10:1>
Scientists are curious about the nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#11:1>
Out <+> of </+> curiosity they observed the things in the nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#12:1>
Thus observation is the starting point of the scientific method.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#13:1>
The scientific method consists of observation, abstraction,
classification Hypothesis & Generalisation etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#14:1>
<mention> Abstraction </mention> means saparation <}> <-> the
</-> <+> of </+> </}> certain <}> <-> object or thing </-> <+> objects or
things </+> </}> from others when scientists <}> <-> observes </-> <+>
observe </+> </}> the facts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#15:1>
They find a resemblances between the objects & <del> fin </del>
constructs a <}> <-> uncontradictionary </-> <+> uncontradictory </+> </}>
<}> <-> experians </-> <+> experiences </+> </}> about the fact & their
special characteristics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#16:1>
Thus after abstructing the fact from others scientists <}> <->
finds </-> <+> find </+> </}> out certain classes eg : -

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#17:1>
( 1) ICE IS COOL

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#18:1>
( 2) ALL CROWS ARE BLACK

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#19:1>
( 3) ALL ROSES HAVE <}> <-> THRONES </-> <+> THORNS </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#20:1>
The ultimate aim of scientific method is <+> to </+> find out
genralised knowledge of the facts ie drawing genralisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#21:1>
But genralisation <}> <-> can not </-> <+> cannot </+> </}> be
drawn without the abstraction.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#22:1>
<mention> Abstraction </mention> provides scientist certain class
having certain characteristics.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#23:1>
Then scientists further proceed with additional & repeated <}> <->
observation </-> <+> observations </+> </}> & experimentation for drawing the
Generalisation about the facts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#24:1>
He <}> <-> wanted </-> <+> wants </+> </}> to know certain things
<-> always </-> always associated with certain characteristics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#25:1>
Thus <mention> abstraction </mention> is necessary in scientific
method while drawing the final generalisations. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.3 ( a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#26:2>
<mention> Abstraction & Generalisation </mention> are the two
important steps in scientific method. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#27:2>
<}> <-> Scienentific </-> <+> Scientific </+> </}> method <del>
of </del> consists of observation, <del> ab </del> abstraction,
classification & generalisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#28:2>
<del> Scienet </del> Scientists <}> <-> uses </-> <+> use </+>
</}> scientific <del> and </del> method while drawing the exact cause &
effect relationship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#29:2>
There is certain <}> <-> relation in </-> <+> relationship </+>
</}> abstraction & Generalisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#30:2>
Because out of curiosity when a scientist observes a facts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#31:2>
He observes directly or indirectly with the help of instruments.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#32:2>
But only observation is not enough in scientific method. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#33:2>
After observing the fact the scientist abstracts <-> that there
</-> certain <del> relationship in </del> characteristics in the observed
facts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#34:2>
Therefore <mention> abstraction </mention> is also a primary form of
generalisation because scientists primarily <}> <-> generalised </-> <+>
generalise </+> </}> <-> that </-> the observed fact <}> <-> has </-> <+> and
</+> </}> certain characteristics. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#35:2>
eg : - ( 1) ALL CROWS ARE BLACK

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#36:2>
( 2) ICE IS COOL

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#37:2>
( 3) FIRE BURNS

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#38:2>
( 4) IRON RUSTS IN MOIST AIR

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#39:2>
After primarily finding out <del> that </del> certain
characteristics of the observed scientist draws the final generalisation with
repeated <}> <-> observation </-> <+> observations </+> </}> & experimention

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#40:2>
Scientists <}> <-> wants </-> <+> want </+> </}> to know why that
characteristics <del> of </del> are always associated with the object, & with
this curiosity he proceeds with scientific method & draws a generalisation
which is universalised & which becomes law of nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#41:2>
Thus there is certain relationship in abstraction &
generalisation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#42:2>
Because abstraction is primary generalisation of final generalisation
which is taken off after arriving at the final cause & effect relationship.
</p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.4 ( a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#43:3>
Scientific method is the starting point of scientific
investigation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#44:3>
There are certain regularities & irregularities in the nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#45:3>
The scientists <}> <-> wants </-> <+> want </+> </}> to investigate

<h> 2 <ul> Frequent use of Instrument </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#52:3>
<}> <-> when ever </-> <+> Whenever a </+> </}> scientist
observes the facts in the nature it is not possible to observe all the facts
directly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#53:3>
Sometimes scientists <}> <-> takes </-> <+> take </+> </}> the help
of instrument for observation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#54:3>
eg:- Thermometre, barometre, measuring scale, <}> <-> microscop </->

<h> 7 <ul> Dynamic Nature of science </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#66:3>
The subject <}> <-> metter </-> <+> matter </+> </}> of science

<I> <O> Q.4 ( b) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#71:4>
Scientific method <-> is </-> consists of observations,
abstruction, classification, genralisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#72:4>
As scientists <}> <-> wants </-> <+> want </+> </}> to reveal the
nature as real & <del> unders </del> understandable.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#73:4>
They use scientific method. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#74:4>
When scientists <}> <-> starts </-> <+> start </+> </}>
invistigation with scientific method there are certain <+> rules </+> to

<h> <ul> 1 A problematic fact </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#76:4>
The problematic fact is the base for the scientific method.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#77:4>
When a <}> <-> scientists </-> <+> scientist </+> </}> comes across
the problematic facts, <}> <-> He </-> <+> he </+> </}> starts with

<h> <ul> 2 Construction of preliminary Hypothesis </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#79:4>
When scientist faces a a problem, <}> <-> He </-> <+> he </+>
</}> wants to know the the cause & the effect of problem, so he collects some
primary information through problematic fact.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#80:4>
He <}> <-> buits </-> <+> builds </+> </}> a <}> <-> prilimanary </->
<+> preliminary </+> </}> hypothesis as <}> <-> a ibial </-> <+> an ideal
</+> </}> idea for the problematic fact. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#81:4>
eg:- Edward Jennar faces the problem of small pox in the a
village, <}> <-> He </-> <+> he </+> </}> thinks over it & constructs the <}>
<-> prilimanary </-> <+> preliminary </+> </}> hypothesis to find out the
cause of the small pox. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#82:4>
<h> <ul> 3 Collection of additional data </ul> : - </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#83:4>
At this stage additional data or information is collected by the
scientists to draw the final generalisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#84:4>
eg:- Proceeding above example the scientist <}> <-> edward </->
<+> Edward </+> </}> Jennar collects extra information of problematic fact.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#85:4>
<h> <ul> 4 Construction of explanatory Hypothesis </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#86:4>
At this step <del> the </del> after taking into account all the
<del> a </del> <}> <-> avalable </-> <+> available </+> </}> information <}>
<-> scientists </-> <+> the scientist </+> </}> draws the explanatory
hypothesis to explain the problematic fact. </p> eg : -

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#87:4>
Edward Jennar with <}> <-> avalable </-> <+> available </+> </}>
information & imagination of his own towards the subject finds that the germs
spreading small-pox can be used for vaccination & diagosis of small pox. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#88:4>
<h> <ul> Generalisation </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#89:4>
This is the last of scientific method.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#90:4>
After constructing the explanatory hypothesis the scientists draw the
generalisation of the problematic fact. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#91:4>
eg:- Edward Jennar <}> <-> genralised </-> <+> generalised </+>
</}> that the person who is <}> <-> continiously </-> <+> continuously </+>
</}> in the contact of <}> <-> jerms </-> <+> germs </+> </}> cannot <}> <->
caught </-> <+> catch </+> </}> small pox.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#92:4>
He also generalised that the chemical of <}> <-> jerms </-> <+> germs
</+> </}> of small-pox when injected in the body of patient of small-pox
he will be cured by small-pox. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.5 ( a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#93:5>
Hypothesis is a tentative statement or guess work to find out the
final cause & effect relationship behind every natural happening.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#94:5>
A Good hypothesis should be have certain qualities. </p> <&> serial
number 1 to 7 are circled below each paras </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#95:5>
1 The scientific Hypothesis should be relative to the nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#96:5>
<del> Real </del> relativity of <del> no </del> Hypothesis is
essential for a good Hypothesis.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#97:5>
Because Hypothesis not related to the subject matter of the problem
the scientist <}> <-> can not </-> <+> cannot </+> </}> arrived at correct
generalisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#98:5>
2 The scientific Hypothesis should be <}> <-> compitable </-> <+>
compatible </+> </}> in nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#99:5>
A Good hypothesis should be <}> <-> compitive </-> <+> competitive
</+> </}> in nature against the other hypothesis constructed by the scientist
on the same <}> <-> problume </-> <+> problem </+> </}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#100:5>
3 A good scientific hypothesis should have explanatory power.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#101:5>
Because before drawing final generalisation the scientist arrives at
explanatory hypothesis which should give explanation to the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#102:5>
4 A good hypothesis should focus same light on each & every
factor <+> of the </+> problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#103:5>
5 A good hypothesis should <+> be </+> comprehensive in nature.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#104:5>
6 A good hypothesis should be flexible in nature<del>.</del>,
<}> <-> Because </-> <+> because </+> </}> nature is full of uncertainities.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#105:5>
7 A good hypothesis should give least <del> report of </del> <}>
<-> risult </-> <+> result </+> </}> of the problem as it selected after
deducting the number of hypothesis. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.5 ( b) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#106:6>
Hypothesis is a tentative statement or a trial idea or a guess
work for a given problematic fact. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#107:6>
Construction of hypothesis is <}> <-> complitly </-> <+>
completely </+> </}> personal & individual work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#108:6>
There is no certain rule of constructing Hypothesis.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#109:6>
<del> He </del> It <-> is </-> entirely <}> <-> depend </-> <+>

<+> proper Hypothesis </+> </}> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#111:6>
Refutation of Hypos means dropping up of unsuitable Hypos &
adopting the suitable ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#112:6>
When scientist faces the problem he <}> <-> put </-> <+> puts

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-015#113:6>
It is not necessary that very 1st <}> <-> hypos </-> <+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#114:6>
The scientist <}> <-> keep<del>e</del> </-> <+> keeps </+> </}> on
constructing the Hypos unless he got the satisfactory result.

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#115:6>
He refuses the unsuitable Hypos & construct new Hypo if that will

<ICE-IND:W1A-015#117:6>
He <del> refuses to</del> accepted 19th Hypothesis to draw the final
