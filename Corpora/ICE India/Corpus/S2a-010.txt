<ICE-IND:S2A-010#45:1:A>
And for the first time in <,> the Asia Pacific championship you
have this diving competitions also <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-010#46:1:A>
I understand about forty-five divers <,> <{> <[> yes <,> are there
and <w> let's </w> say for China <,> the <,> one of best diving <{> <[>
nations in the world </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#47:1:F>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#48:1:F>
<[> And unfortunately </[> </{> the China is not participating
in dive

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#49:1:A>
Oh thinking will be this competition is not very

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#50:1:F>
Yeah very low <,> <w> that's </w> a bit slow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-010#51:1:F>
For them <w> it's </w> a very low competition <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-010#52:1:F>
China competing for diving you know <,> they are the world class
<,,> they are the best in the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-010#53:1:F>
So therefore for them of course there is no competition <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#54:1:A>
But even then <w> it's </w> good <w> they've </w> come for
swimming atleast <,,> and this uh <,> which adds a great glamour and colour
to the competition <,> and so many of these younger children <,,> who will be
participating in the age group

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#55:1:F>

Shetty <,,> all <,,> facing the <,> screen <,,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#57:1:F>
So the youngsters who are here <,> not only from India but
from the other ten countries <,> will be the names to reckon with in <,>
atleast the Asian swimming uh <,> scene <,> in the next few years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#58:1:A>
Yes

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-010#59:1:F>
