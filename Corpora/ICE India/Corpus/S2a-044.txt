<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-044#1:1:A>
I will take <,,> exactly ten minutes of yours <,> to brief you
<,,> about our institution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#2:1:A>
Many people may not know <,,> the background <,,> under which this
institution was born <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#3:1:A>
I don't want <,,> to boast about myself <,,> but some of my friends
for example now <,> my good friend Mr Leherchand Shah <,,> he has been
associated with me indirectly for this school <,,> right from the first day
<,,> we decided to start this institution <,,> and still <,,> he has a soft
corner for the institution <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#4:1:A>
Whenever <,,> I request him to do something <,> he <,> goes out of
the way <,> and does it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#5:1:A>
Now he knows the background <,> and some of the <,> elder people
<,,> of <,,> the so called founder members of the institution <,> they are
knowing the background <,> of course <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#6:1:A>
In this particular instance we must remember <,,> our late <,,>
revered <,,> <indig> parampujya </indig> <,,> Gopalacharya Mouli <,,> who was
the first person <,,> to inaugurate this institution <,,> and also blessed us
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#7:1:A>
And <,,> till his last <,,> he had his blessings with us <,,> and
even in his absence <,,> our present <,,> <indig> parampujya </indig>
Vidyasimhacharya <,> is at the back of the institution <,> invisibly <,,> and
he has been blessing us all along <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#8:1:A>
Now we <,,> believe <,,> <w> God's </w> grace <,,> <w> elder's </w>
blessings <,> always lead <,,> to success of <,,> anything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#9:1:A>
Building an institution <,,> starting your activities <,,> social
work <,,> commercial activities <,,> anything <,> to do good <,,> to humanity
<,,> whether it is a medical aspect <,,> or any kind of thing <,,> or
religious aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#10:1:A>
Now this institution <,,> when I migrated to Mulund in nineteen
fifty-seven <,,> beginning <,> or fifty-six end <,,> there were some
enterprising <,,> Kannada speaking people <,> in Dombivali Thana <,> Mulund
<,,> and uh <,,> neighbouring <,> suburbs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#11:1:A>
They came to me <,,> they just requested me <,> why not we start
some <,> Karnataka Sangha and continue some activities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#12:1:A>
I said okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#13:1:A>
Any cultural activity <,,> and <,,> naturally in those years <,,>
before <,,> nineteen fifty-six <,,> Dharwar Belgaum Bijapur Karwar districts
were <,,> the part of Bombay state <,,> and <,,> many Kannada speaking people
<-> in those </-> from <+> these </+> districts they <-> came and </->
migrated to Bombay <,,> for education <,,> for <-> their </-> building up
their career commercial activities <,> came and settled down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#14:1:A>
They became one <,,> with the masses <,,> of the locality <,,> and
they started <,,> their own activities <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#15:1:A>
Naturally <,,> culture <,> and civilisation <,,> and the tradition
<,,> in India differs right from Himalaya up to <}> <-> <.> Ka </.> </-> <,>
<=> Kanyakumari </=> </}> <,,> slightly

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#16:1:A>
Though <,,> we are all one <,,> so far as the thinking is concerned
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#17:1:A>
But <,,> the traditions in areawise <,> languagewise <,> some
difference take place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#18:1:A>
So some people said we should maintain our <,,> tradition also <,>
though we have migrated from our <,,> districts and <}> <-> come </-> <+>
came </+> </}> and settled down here

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#19:1:A>
Now <w> we've </w> become a part of this place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#20:1:A>
Of course <,,> I should say <,,> <w> I'm </w> here from nineteen
forty-five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#21:1:A>
<w> I've </w> seen <,,> the generation passing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#22:1:A>
Today <,,> some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the
people who came fifty hundred years ago from Karnataka <,> their children do
not know even kannada language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#23:1:A>
But that doesn't mean <,> we are not here on a linguist aspect or
the communal aspect other thing

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#24:1:A>
It is only to maintain <,> the culture and tradition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#25:1:A>
Each culture and tradition <,> has its own <,,> history <,,> has
its own good points <,,> and therefore <,> we are only seeing <,,> the good
points <,> of the culture and civilization <,> and not the bad points <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#26:1:A>
Now for example <,,> he is uh <,> speaking this language he is
speaking this language I must hate him

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#27:1:A>
No not that way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#28:1:A>
Bombay is a cosmopolitan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#29:1:A>
Every language every caste every creed <,> it is a mini India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#30:1:A>
And we are also a part of mini India <,,> though originally we come
from some place <,> but we have to maintain our culture and tradition

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#31:1:A>
We are trying to maintain <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#32:1:A>
For that purpose only I agreed we started <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#33:1:A>
But I used to see <,,> in those days <,,> there was only one
Kannada school somewhere in <,> a corner of <,,> Sion <,,> and Matunga <,>
that too in <-> a </-> hutments <,> military barracks running <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#34:1:A>
And ultimately <,> this was shifted to Wadala <,,> and I used to
see <,> young boys <,,> seven years eight years <,> going in the <}> <->
railway </-> <=> train </=> </}> <,> all the way from Ambarnath Dombivali
Kalyan and other thing etcetera or Wadala <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#35:1:A>
So I said look <,,> if at all there is anything <,,> it is
education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#36:1:A>
With the education <,,> we can bring up <,,> our <,,> people <,,>
or <,,> the society <,,> which has come and settle down here <,> become a
part of Bombay <,> they will definitely <,,> be benefitted

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#37:1:A>
So <,> why not we start uh <,,> an education institution <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#38:1:A>
Everybody appreciated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#39:1:A>
Then <,,> we more or less <,,> decreased <,,> the cultural <,,>
activities <,> of the Karnataka Sangha <,,> and started <,> the <mention>
Vidya Prasaraka Mandala </mention> <,> and in those days we used to call it
Mulund-Thana <,> because <,,> there were many people from Mulund many people
from Thana even Dombivali everybody was coming <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#40:1:A>
So <,,> it was <,,> Mulund-Thana that was the name given and we
started <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#41:1:A>
In the initial stages <,,> some devoted <-> few </-> workers <,,>
they associated with the institution <,,> and some of them were not still
born in the institution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#42:1:A>
They were born a few years later <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#43:1:A>
Now I can say Kamath or Joshi or uh <,> Shastri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#44:1:A>
They came and joined a little later <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#45:1:A>
Then this institution <,,> started <,,> increasing the activities
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#46:1:A>
We didn't have <,,> any place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#47:1:A>
So the first <,,> one year <,> the institution started working <,>
at my premises where I was staying <,> in the balcony <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#48:1:A>
And there was one teacher <,,> who sacrificed for couple of years
<,,> one by name Mrs Setlur <,> she was a qualified teacher <,,> and <w>
you'll </w> be surprised <,> I used to pay from my pocket fifteen <indig>
rupees </indig> <,,> per month to her <,,> to conduct the Kannada K G <,>
Kannada first standard Kannada second standard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#49:1:A>
One teacher conducting all the schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#50:1:A>
And we had devoted workers <,,> like one Mr Bharbare he was working
in the <w> A G's </w> office <,> now I do not know where he is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#51:1:A>
And there was another Mr Malagi <,,> these two people <,,> had
sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants <,> not I want
to belittle <-> a </-> government servants <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#52:1:A>
But <,,> when <w> you've </w> got your own shop <,> you have to go
right eight <w> O'clock </w> and open it and <}> <-> keep </-> <+> be </+>
</}> there whether the customers come or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#53:1:A>
But the government officer he can go at ten <w> O'clock </w> and
come back at five <w> O'clock </w> <,> so long he completes the work <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#54:1:A>
But they were devoted workers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#55:1:A>
They used to go door to door where Kannada people are staying <,,>
and request them <,,> please <,,> send your child to our school <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#56:1:A>
That some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#57:1:A>
Somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring <,> they were <,>
they were these two were <,,> the boys who were <,,> todays <indig> aaya
</indig> who bring the school children to the school and take them back home
<,> that kind of activity they have done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#58:1:A>
I mean that was the kind of <,,> attachment devotions <,> for the
work they had <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#59:1:A>
And this way the school went on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#60:1:A>
Then <,> in Mulund <,,> in those days the population was about <,>
thirty thousand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#61:1:A>
Fortunately or unfortunately <,,> I had many Kacchi friends <,> who
developed <,> and we started one small social club <,> of Mulund <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#62:1:A>
Of which <,,> our Dr Lalan the first <,,> the oldest M B B S doctor
general practitioner <,> Leherchand Shah <,> and some of the people we
started the activities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#63:1:A>
And then <,> slowly <,,> I rather <,> converted them you know now
conversion takes place <,> converted them <,,> to devote something for the
school <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#64:1:A>
During this contact I came across <,,> the managing committee
members chairman president everything etcetera of the Gujrathi schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#65:1:A>
So Manilal Chaturbhuj Gandhi <,> became a very good friend of mine
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#66:1:A>
Because of my association with these people <,> and my activities
<,> so became a friend <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#67:1:A>
I requested him one day <,,> we are small people we don't have
money we don't have funds we don't have workers <,> can we use can we use
<,,> your school <,> when you are not using without disturbing you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#68:1:A>
He said most welcome <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#69:1:A>
Then I asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#70:1:A>
He said <,> <quote> who asks you to pay the rent <,,> ? </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#71:1:A>
They didn't ask a single <indig> nayapaisa </indig> <,,> and then
<,> <w> Manibhai's </w> all the children became our good friends <,,> and
they also <,,> from that managing committee they looked after us very well
<,> and sometime you know <,> when our school grew <,> upto S S C standard
<,,> <O> cough </O> the grown up children sometime become mischievous <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#72:1:A>
They used to break the glass <,,> they used to make it dirty <,,>
they don't uh <,> take care of the toilet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#73:1:A>
Then tear the paper and throw it somewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#74:1:A>
Now we were running in the morning shift <,,> and <,,> hardly there
was half an hour <}> <-> <.> dist </.> </-> <,> <=> difference </=> </}>
between their school and our school <,> and lot of complaint <,> from the
headmaster <,> of the Gujrathi school started coming this this this this this
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#75:1:A>
But let me tell you <,,> my good friend <,,> Manilal and his team
of committee members <,> they were so cooperative

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#76:1:A>
One day they called me <indig> Arey Kulkarni <,> tum ek kam karo
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#77:1:A>
Tell me what is it <,> <indig> dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#78:1:A>
Children make mischief and other thing etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#79:1:A>
So therefore <,> before this school come <,> they will just clean
it and make it good so that I don't have to listen to my own principal to
coming <,> uh I mean uh making complaint against you people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#80:1:A>
So <,> this is a good idea <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#81:1:A>
It should have struck <,> struck the headmaster there at that time
<,> but he didn't <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#82:1:A>
Our Gudi was there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#83:1:A>
I forced Gudi to come and join this institution

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#84:1:A>
He was not willing to come <,,> because <,,> two reasons <,,> today
we all of us look to <,> security <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#85:1:A>
Now <,,> our children grow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#86:1:A>
Okay what are you going to do <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#87:1:A>
So in good old days <,,> are you getting a government job <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#88:1:A>
Close the eye and join <,> because it is secured <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#89:1:A>
So private company <,,> is it a long standing <,> then join <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#90:1:A>
If it is a private company <,,> just started <,> oh nobody knows
whether after five years this will remain or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#91:1:A>
So those were the days <,> when everybody was looking for <,,> a
secured job <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#92:1:A>
Mr Gudi had already a secured permanent job <,,> in one of the
leading schools <,> of N K E S <,,> but somehow I succeeded in brainwashing
him <,,> and I told him <,,> we may not have money <,> we may not pay you
what you are getting <,,> but we have a soft corner for you if you come and
sacrifice <,,> and ultimately I had to cut a joke at him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#93:1:A>
Who is at the back of you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#94:1:A>
He even today a bachelor <,,> still there associated with the
school indirectly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#95:1:A>
Who is at the back of you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#96:1:A>
For whom you want to have a <,> a secure job <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#97:1:A>
Come join <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#98:1:A>
Do some social work at least <w> you'll </w> get a good name <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#99:1:A>
He came <,,> joined <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#100:1:A>
Then <,,> all the youngsters <,> team came and joined <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#101:1:A>
Then we were on the look out for a place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#102:1:A>
And this Kamath came across the landlord of this place <,,> and uh
we had nobody to pay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#103:1:A>
This man Mahalay had a very big land <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#104:1:A>
So he was selling piece by piece <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#105:1:A>
We selected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#106:1:A>
Do you know it took us <,,> five years to make the payment to him
piece by piece piece by piece <,> hundred <indig> rupees </indig> two hundred
<indig> rupees </indig> thousand <indig> rupees </indig> two thousand <indig>
rupees </indig> <,,> because we were to collect <,> and give it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#107:1:A>
In those days what was the mode of collection <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#108:1:A>
Sorry <,> to say <,,> some of our Kannada people <,> at that time
<,,> were <,,> in trade in business in industry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#109:1:A>
I was a very small man in those years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#110:1:A>
I used to go to them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#111:1:A>
Look <,,> you are from Karnataka <,> we have started a Kannada
school <,> we want to do this we don't have funds <,> government is not
giving us any grant <,> shall we <,,> will you help us <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#112:1:A>
So <,,> some people <,,> who had love for education <,,> okay here
is our fifty <indig> rupees </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#113:1:A>
In those days fifty <indig> rupees </indig> was a big amount <,,>
nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#114:1:A>
Hundred <indig> rupees </indig> was a big amount <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#115:1:A>
Some people used to ask me <,,> are you sending your <.> ch </.>
they asked me point blank question <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#116:1:A>
Are you sending your children to this school <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#117:1:A>
I said no my children are going to English medium school

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#118:1:A>
There was a Simpson School or something like that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#119:1:A>
Then why do you want this headache <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#120:1:A>
Better go away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#121:1:A>
Even people insulted me like this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#122:1:A>
So <,,> ultimately I came to the conclusion <,,> any help or
donation will come from <,> people who have <,,> if I go and ask them who do
not have what can they give <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#123:1:A>
At the most <,> people who have got a love for education <,,> they
may give the sympathy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#124:1:A>
If they are elders they may bless <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#125:1:A>
If they are youngsters <,> okay you ask me run about <,> I will go
run about beg borrow <,> won't steal <,> but <w> I'll </w> get something <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#126:1:A>
If they are youngsters <,> who has a devotion for education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#127:1:A>
So I tried <,,> fortunately for me associated with a chemical
trade in uh Bombay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#128:1:A>
I started only one aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#129:1:A>
This <,,> most of the Gujrati people were in the chemical trade in
those years <,,> and I was associated with the chemical trade <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#130:1:A>
I used to give them <,> advice <,> guidance <,,> whenever they
came <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#131:1:A>
They had a sympathy for me <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#132:1:A>
So I said let me try to tap the source <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#133:1:A>
So once a year <,,> I used to go to them <,,> with a small request
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#134:1:A>
And in those days <,,> for a souvenir <,> we used to keep hundred
<indig> rupees </indig> <,> is the highest <,> for advertisement fees <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#135:1:A>
And hundred <indig> rupees </indig> very few people will pay <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#136:1:A>
Half page quarter page one eighth page <,,> based on hundred <,,>
and go door to door <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#137:1:A>
Some people say <indig> arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#138:1:A>
Even they would not ask for a receipts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#139:1:A>
I said no you must take the receipt <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#140:1:A>
This money collected in those years <,,> was utilised only for
<,,> paying the <,,> salary of the teachers <,,> plus whatever we were able
to contribute from our pockets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#141:1:A>
Then I said this way we cannot do it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#142:1:A>
Bhimsen Joshi being a very good friend of mine <,> invariably
whenever he was in Bombay he was <,,> camping in my house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#143:1:A>
Those days also <,,> like today his fees are <,> fifty thousand
<indig> rupees </indig>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#144:1:A>
In those days <,,> he would go and sing <,,> if you give a good
cup of tea at your house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#145:1:A>
So <,> I used to request him <,,> and he said <quote> okay for
your school <,> <w> I'll </w> give you a free performance </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-044#146:1:A>
And what I was in return giving <,> he would come <,> for some
other programme at their expense <,> and one day give it for our school <,>
