<bold> By Prof. Amartya Sen </bold> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#3:1>
<bold> T<smallcaps>HE</smallcaps> topic relates to the conflicting
demands of targeting and universallism in poverty alleviation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#4:1>
The basic argument in favour of strict targeting is clear enough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#5:1>
Efficient selection of beneficiaries reduces the cost of the support
programmes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#6:1>
Transfers of income, support of subsidised food, free availability of
health services and education, and other such programmes, all cost
resources.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#7:1>
The costs of such programmes can be reduced if the beneficiaries are
selected on some strict criterion of needs and the non-poor are excluded
from having the benefit of such programmes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#8:1>
That, in nutshell, is the main argument in favour of strict
targeting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#9:1>
However, targeting also involves some losses and costs, and the
picture is far less simple than it might first appear.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#10:1>
The losses can be of various types.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#11:1>
First there is the cost of administration and the expenses of
bureaucracies in executing selection on the basis of a strict criterion of
needs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#12:1>
Second, it is very hard to maintain the quality of services that are
reserved only for the politically weak groups of the society, since they lack
the social power to monitor quality and ensure the soundness of the
services offered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#13:1>
For example, health services reserved for the poor can rapidly
deteriorate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#14:1>
Third, there is some stigma associated with making use of
transfers that are meant only for the helpless indigent, and targeting can be
a rather demeaning process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#15:1>
There are also some social costs of targeting with which
economists in particular have been much concerned.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#16:1>
To continue the list, the fourth argument to consider on the other
side is the possibility of <quote> " informational distortion" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#17:1>
Any system of targeting the needy tends to produce attempts by
some to distort the relevant information to qualify to get the support.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#18:1>
In order to exclude such <quote> " non-genuine" </quote>
applicants, the scrutiny that is produced can quite easily lead to the
denial of support in genuine cases as well, since some of the relevant
information about needs is hard to obtain and verify.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#19:1>
In trying to prevent what the statisticians would call the <quote>
" type 1" </quote> error of including some non-needy people in the category
of the needy, some <quote> " type 2" </quote> errors are typically committed
of excluding some really needy people from the actual beneficiaries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#20:1>
Fifth, targeting also tends to produce <quote> " incentive
distortions" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#21:1>
Potential beneficiaries may adjust their work and other activities to
qualify to get support, and the result of this can be a significant loss
of social output and activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#22:1>
Finally, an economy based on targeting can be a very <quote> "
invasive" </quote> one, involving constant policing and probing investigation
into the lives of the poorer sections of the community to make sure that they
are genuinely poor enough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#23:1>
The political consequences of such invasiveness can be quite
damaging, especially when the targets of investigation lack the political
or economic power to stand up against it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#24:1>
No matter how specific the criterion is, any need-based selection
tends to give a good deal of power to the government officials over the
lives of potential recipients.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#25:1>
The authority to select can make a minor official into a major
potentate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#26:1>
These social costs can be no less important than the financial
expenses of running a targeted programme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#27:1>
The case for targeting is, thus, not so clear at all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#28:1>
All these difficulties indicate that there is more to the
principle of universalism than the simple theoretical argument for
targeting might suggest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#29:1>
Certainly, the case for universal coverage of elementary health
services and basic education is quite strong, both because these
facilities relate to what might be seen as basic rights to citizens, but
also because the losses and costs of selection can be quite enormous,
outweighing the benefits to be derived from it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#30:1>
Obviously, some types of selection are essential for the
cogency of public policy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#31:1>
If the aim is to vaccinate the children or to increase female
literacy, then surely policies must somehow concentrate on the
unvaccinated kids and illiterate women.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#32:1>
To call that <quote> " targeting" </quote> may appeal to our love of
jargon, but the issue here is no more than making particular policies
specific and purposeful.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#33:1>
Like Monsieur Jourdain in <w> Moliere's </w> play <mention> <bold> Le
Bourgeois Gentilhomme </bold> </mention> , who spoke prose without knowing
it, we are, in some sense, <quote> " targeting" </quote> all the time if
any selection of beneficiaries counts as that.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#34:1>
Giving your daughter a book on her birthday can be seen as a case
of targeting with extreme precision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#35:1>
The real issue in the economics of targeting does not lie in the
acceptance of the necessity to do some selection for purposeful and practical
economic and social policies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#36:1>
The important questions lie elsewhere, to wit, how far to push the
process of selection - - where to stop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#37:1>
Despite the case for universalism in dealing with basic health
services and elementary education, there are other areas in which the
appropriate policies must depend on balancing the advantages of selection
against the various costs and losses that I have tried to identify earlier.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#38:1>
For example, in evaluating programmes of nutritional support (
such as mid-day meals for schoolchildren ) , note must be taken of the costs
of covering all the school children of particular age groups.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#39:1>
But at the same time, the economic and social losses that would be
involved in trying to select on some criterion of needs has also to be given
adequate attention and importance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#40:1>
The choice of where to draw the line must depend on taking an
appropriately broad view of social and economic effects of alternative
policies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#41:1>
There is also the possibility of making use of self-selection in
some cases.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#42:1>
For example, in providing relief from drought or flood, or dealing
with seasonal rural unemployment, a system of open unemployment policy at
a fixed wage rate attracts only those who are ready to put in the necessary
work to earn the corresponding income.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#43:1>
Self-selection becomes a part of the process in such cases, even
though the choice of where to offer such employment opportunities, for
what work, at what wage, and so on, remain the subject of intelligent and
sensitive public discussion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#44:1>
Self-selection can be an important vehicle for providing
services in kind as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#45:1>
For example, medical services that are offered free can be used by
those who need it, but canot be resold to others or capitalised into
financial gains in general.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#46:1>
The important issue here is the ability of the underdogs of the
society to make use of these services as freely as the more fortunate
members of the society tend to do.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#47:1>
This is partly a matter of social courage, of political
universalism, and also of basic education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#48:1>
By expanding elementary education from the deplorably low level at
which it is in India today, use of public services by the poorer sections
of the public can also be enhanced ( as <w> Kerala's </w> example in
particular brings out). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#49:1>
I conclude with two final observations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#50:1>
First, it is important to see the beneficiaries of the poverty
removal programmes as active agents, and not merely as passive recipients of
hand-outs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#51:1>
The jargon of targeting suggests that the objects that are aimed at
have no volition, no will, no ability to respond.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#52:1>
That is the wrong way to pose the problem.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#53:1>
The first necessity is to see the potential beneficiaries as
<quote> " agents" </quote> rather than simply as <quote> " patients" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#54:1>
The detailed arguments about social and economic losses and
benefits, discussed earlier in this talk, all relate to the importance of the
activist perspective. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#55:1>
Second, the design of public services depends, in any country,
on what the powerful groups of that society see as important and
imperative.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#56:1>
For example, generally infectious diseases tend to receive much more
attention than other maladies - - such as undernourishment - - do.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#57:1>
The battle against infectious diseases has been a success story
in the world - - eliminating small-pox, vastly reducing malaria, cutting
down cholera, and so on ( and presumably once the medical riddles are solved,
the same will happen to AIDS as well ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#58:1>
Even the poor get a lot of attention and support when they have
infectious diseases - - partly for good humanitarian reasons but also because
the possibility of the diseases spreading to others wor<l.ries the more
privileged members of the society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#59:1>
<quote> " I sometimes wonder whether there is any way of making
poverty terribly infectious.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#60:1>
If the privileged could catch poverty from the poor they meet in
the street.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#61:1>
I don't doubt at all that poverty would be eliminated with
remarkable speed." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#62:1>
This, alas, won't hap-pen, but the cost of poverty can spread to
others both through political agitation and through informed social
analysis and understanding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#63:1>
Even violent events can sometimes help to make a society face
problems that it would not have otherwise taken up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#64:1>
A good example is the impact of the recent violence in Los Angeles in
bringing the problems of the inner cities in the USA into stronger
political focus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-015#65:1>
In thinking coolly and rationally about the costs and benefits of
targeting, we must not lose sight of the fundamental relevance of social
divisiveness and the power of the immunity of the more privileged sections
of the society from the problems of the social underdogs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#66:1>
The imperatives on the design of targeting cannot but reflect the
reality of political divisions and the comparative vulnerabilities of the
different groups.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#67:1>
The political economy of targeting involves the divisive politics as
well as the rationalist economics of alternative public policies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-015#68:1>
Both aspects demand attention. </p> <*> line above editorial comment
