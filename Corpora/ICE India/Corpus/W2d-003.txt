<h> <bold> INDIAN CONSTITUTION AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION : AN ANALYSIS
OF THEIR RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP </bold> </h> <&> five blank lines </&>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#3:1>
Keeping in view the reciprocity between Constitution and public
administration and <w> latter's </w> instrumentality in upholding
constitutional vlaues, norms and rules, the author discusses Bofors, Stock
Scam and other cases to highlight weaknesses in challenges that
liberalisation is bound to pose, he justifies necessity of reforms. </it>
</p> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#4:1>
THE RELATIONSHIP between the Indian Constitution and public
administration is reciprocal: they influence each other.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#5:1>
The Constitution provides the basic framework for public
administration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#6:1>
Bureaucracies, the main instrument of public administration, may help
the Constitution to survive or undermine it by their actions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#7:1>
This is so because bureaucracies are centres of power in their own
right though not the dominant ones.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#8:1>
They are at once constraints on action and instruments of action.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#9:1>
The nature and purpose of their interfaces with other power centres
and their respective clientele and their strategic relationships with
external reference groups and the political elites influence their normative
framework and standards of professionalism.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#10:1>
In this context, the Constitution provides a frame of reference,
certainly the most salient one.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#11:1>
As such, the character of public administration is influenced by
multiple sources and all of them are under the spell of the Constitution.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#12:1>
<h> CONSTITUTION AND FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNANCE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#13:1>
The Indian Constitution establishes a complex web of institutions
providing channels of accountability:

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#14:1>
1. An administrative system that is responsive to the public and
accountable to the elected functionaries and operative within the bounds of
law, the due process in particular;

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#15:1>
2. A hierarchical system in which administrative positions are
organised in such a way that the top generalist administrators have a
dominant role in policy-making; and <O> <7> page </&> 271 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#16:1>
3. An expert system backed by a plethora of professional
organisations that are interfaced with generalist-based organisation, but
clearly subordinate to the latter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#17:1>
The Constitution provides the normative framework of governance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#18:1>
It sets the rules of the game for the public policy process, for the
formulation and administration of public policies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#19:1>
The overall effect of the rules set by the Constitution is to
facilitate actions as well as limit the discretionary power available to
government officials.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#20:1>
Some rules, as in the case of specified rights of the citizen,
prohibit officials from acting in a contrary direction.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#21:1>
The Constitution also sets a number of political veto points in the
policy process.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#22:1>
The federal structure and judiciary set other structural limits.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#23:1>
The limits to discretionary power are intended to discourage
self-seeking behaviour of public officials and the unfair, arbitrary or
exploitative use of coercive power against the citizenry.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#24:1>
The Constitution also prescribes limits to government power to
prevent policy errors that impose unanticipated costs on the citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#25:1>
Rules are also developed as a means of coping with uncertainty and to
make officials accountable for their actions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#26:1>
The notion that constitutional legitimacy for public administration
is extensive, subject to its operation within the framework, needs
recognition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#27:1>
Does a highly centralised administrative state flow from the
constitutional imperatives?

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#28:1>
The Constitution does legitimise an activist State and one that is
highly welfarist, if not socialistic, the latter being a later addition.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#29:1>
There is also a clear mandate for solving many public problems
emergining in a multi-ethnic society.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#30:1>
In the economic and social spheres, it is not expected to be a
minimal government.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#31:1>
In the social sphere, its role is vital as a consensus-builder.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#32:1>
Having gone through the colonial phase of authority and the
Independence movement, the framers of the Constitution were not intent upon a
centralised administrative State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#33:1>
Consent and consensus were to be the basic ingredients.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#34:1>
The Constitution also provides for equity: all parties should have
relatively equal access to the decision-making process in public
administration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#35:1>
It implies that public administration must be responsive to public
interest in a broad sense.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#36:1>
Equality under law is ensured.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#37:1>
So is the centrality of human dignity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#38:1>
The Constitution emphasises a mix of values to guide public
administration to ensure that it is human, democratically responsive and
efficient.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#39:1>
The values are not hierarchically ordered.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#40:1>
The goal of trying to make public administration legitimate through
implementation of efficiency measures tends to often conflict with
representativeness goals or the imperatives of political and social
mobilisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#41:1>
The Indian Constitution did not explicitly suggest anywhere the
specific option as to whether the government should be an economic regulator,
an economic administrator, or an economic player.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#42:1>
As a regulator, it is an umpire refereeing the behaviour of competing
interests by applying specific sets of rules.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#43:1>
The design and application of a particular set of rules would, <O>
<&> page </&> 272 </O> however, have specific policy outcomes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#44:1>
Controls on monopolies, licensing, imports and exports are examples
of such rules.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#45:1>
As an economic administrator, the government executes directly some
operations, applying particular decision criteria and following set
procedures.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#46:1>
As an economic player, it pursues specific outcomes on a case-by-case
basis, putting together packages of incentives and disincentives, some
persuasive and others coercive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#47:1>
In shaping particular outcomes or preferring some sponsors over
others, it exercises discretionary power.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#48:1>
Over the years, the Governmment chose to play all the three roles.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#49:1>
The transformational character of the State provided scope for an
activist public administration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#50:1>
As the provider of public services to citizens, public
bureaucracies can determine the character of government to a significant
extent.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#51:1>
They are instruments by which government serves or burdens citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#52:1>
Indirectly, the limits on administrative discretion help to limit the
discretion of political leaders to impose costs on citizens or in making
attempts to enrich themselves. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#53:1>
<h> UPHOLDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPERATIVES: SOME RECENT MAJOR CASES
</h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#54:1>
<h> <it> Bofors Gun Case </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#55:1>
The framers of the Constitution were committed to efficiency in
government, but they loathed corruption more than they loved efficiency.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#56:1>
As a result, they shaped the rules for administering Indian
bureaucracy in ways that restrain its discretionary power.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#57:1>
The focus is on ethics in government, on the part of both politicians
and officials.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#58:1>
Ethics in government has several dimensions: ethics as personal
honesty and integrity, ethics as fairness toward others, ethics as respect
for others, and ethics as a commitment to diligence and excellence in
performing <w> one's </w> work.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#59:1>
The architects of the Indian Constitution, most of whom had wide
exposure to the Gandhian values, expected both the political elite and the
civil servants to be guided by formal accountability requirements as well as
internalised moral restraints as a decisive check on abuses of political
authority and administrative discretion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#60:1>
On the issue of relations between political executives and civil
servants, the Constitution does not display the flavour of <quote> "
politics-administration dichotomy" </quote> , but it recognises the
neutrality of the civil service so that the political masters have access to
sources of independent assessment, advice and policy guidance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#61:1>
Collusion or <it> quid pro quo </it> deals of any type between
contiguous functionaries are definitely not expected.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#62:1>
The Bofors gun controversy and the Stock Exchange-Bank Scam (
referred hereafter as Stock Scam) are two recent illustrations which provide
ample evidence for reflection on the extent to which the imperatives of the
Constitution are upheld. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#63:1>
The Bofors gun controversy provides an instance of how the
framework of rules set by the Constitution were flouted.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#64:1>
Between 1982 and 1985, the Army headquarters had on six occasions
rated Sofma, the French gun, higher <O> <&> page </&> 273 </O> than Bofors.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#65:1>
With a new incumbent as the Chief of the Army, the Army headquarters
for the first time, in early 1986, placed Bofors gun above Sofma and that too
without preparation of a detailed matrix of marks.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#66:1>
The file moved quickly, thanks to the connivance of key bureaucrats.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#67:1>
The Prime Minister took a decision in favour of the Bofors gun.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#68:1>
His approval of the contract signed with Bofors ( March, 1986) was
not covered by sanction by the President of India as required under Article
77 of the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#69:1>
The decision on the Bofors contract was also not placed before the
Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#70:1>
Once the Swedish radio broadcast about the payment of a commission to
agents, diversionary efforts and ingenious attempts at a cover-up of evidence
started.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#71:1>
In response to criticisms inside and outside Parliament, the Prime
Minister went on to shift his stand from one occasion to another.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#72:1>
First, the existence of a middleman / agent and payment of a
commission were flatly denied.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#73:1>
The payment, if any, by Bofors was termed winding-up charges.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#74:1>
Later, the payment was stated to be for working expenses.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#75:1>
Still later, it was conceded that Bofors paid commission, but no
Indian was involved.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#76:1>
Subsequently, it was stated that the Government had no knowledge of
the person or persons involved in receiving commission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#77:1>
The Government of India did not act on the suggestion of the Indian
Mission in Sweden to have an audit of the entire gamut of transactions of
India with Bofors by Indian Audit authorities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#78:1>
Nor did the Government of India seek assistance from its Swedish
counterpart. <sp> 1</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#79:1>
Attempts to cover up this scandal were evident from the fact that for
about a year the relevant files were not made available by the Government for
audit to the Comptroller & Auditor-General of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#80:1>
The Joint Parliamentary Committee ( JPC) submitted a report which
exposed nothing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#81:1>
Then there was delay in tabling the Comptroller & <w> Auditor-General's
</w> report before the Parliament, in early 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#82:1>
Further, the authority of Parliament itself was undermined by the
refusal of the Presiding Officers to permit debate on important matters
concerning public probity or by their resorting to wholesale expunction of
proceedings.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#83:1>
General Sundarji, in one of his interviews, refers to the <quote> "
crumbling processes affecting institutions" </quote> , other than the Army.
<sp> 2</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#84:1>
The Attorney <w> General's </w> brief to the JPC does not reflect the
role he is expected to perform under the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#85:1>
His role was in startling contrast with that of the Comptroller &
Auditor-General.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#86:1>
As Cushrone Irani of the <it> Statesman </it> observes: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#87:1>
The return of <indig> Rs. </indig> 64 <indig> crore </indig> is
not the issue.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#88:1>
The central issue is that since April 1987 this <w> country's </w>
leadership have lied to the elected representatives of our people in
Parliament and have lied repeatedly. <O> <&> page </&> 274 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#89:1>
Elsewhere in the democratic world, lying to Parliament is a crime
worse than murder.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#90:1>
The penalty is not merely death; it is dishonour.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#91:1>
Democratic governments are founded on the trust and confidence of
the people they govern.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#92:1>
Bluff, bluster and worse are not acceptable substitutes. <sp> 3</sp>
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#93:1>
<h> <it> Stock Scam Case </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#94:1>
The mid - 1992, Stock Scam is yet another instance of
governmental inaction, if not a cover-up.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#95:1>
The Scam was not caused by old-fashioned accounting procedures or by
a lack of computers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#96:1>
Forgeries, falsehoods and illegal favours siphoned off public money
into private hands but our equanimity was not ruffled for long.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#97:1>
The doctrine of ministerial responsibility, a focal point of the
parliamentary system, was not invoked.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#98:1>
Going by Indian democratic norms of the pre-Indira Gandhi era, at
least four Ministers should have quit the Union Council of Ministers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#99:1>
Only one Minister, whose culpability in the crime was not
established, left the Government.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#100:1>
Bofors and the Stock Scam drive home the point that the electoral
process provided under the Constitution does not by itself provide sufficient
checks on abuse of discretionary power.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#101:1>
The weakness is perhaps germane to a Parliamentary system which,
while providing for a strong executive, disallows continuous checks and
balances of the Presidential model. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#102:1>
<h> <it> Violations of Human Rights </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#103:1>
Day in and day out, our conscience is shocked by news of the
violation of human rights.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#104:1>
The admission by the Union Home Minister and the Minister for
Internal Security that the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities ( Prevention)
Act ( TADA) has often been misused by state governments confirms what is
already known.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#105:1>
The statistics revealed by the National Human Rights Commission are
mind-boggling.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#106:1>
Of a total of 65,000 cases, Gujarat leads with 19,000, followed by
Punjab 17,000, Jammu & Kashmir 10,000 and Andhra Pradesh 8,900.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#107:1>
Interestingly, 95 per cent of the cases registered under TADA had
been rejected by the courts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#108:1>
If the rate of convictions under the Act is merely five per cent,
the statute can scarcely be said to have been judiciously used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#109:1>
Women activists have been repeating allegations of atrocities
against women.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#110:1>
Remember the incident in Surat about an year ago when women were
gangraped and killed in what literally was a blaze of light focused on them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#111:1>
We were all duly horrified; some demands were made for apprehension
and punishment of the culprits.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#112:1>
That was the end of the matter.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#113:1>
More recently, Miss Katia, a French tourist, was subjected to a
similar horror is Chandigarh, allegedly by the grandson of the Chief Minister
of Punjab.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#114:1>
The <O> <&> page </&> 275 </O> cruelties and mental torture
perpetrated against women reflect the vulnerabilities not merely of Indian
women, but of the Indian democratic system.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#115:1>
Countless number of <indig> Harijan </indig> women have been victims
of atrocities by caste Hindus.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#116:1>
Most of the time, the culprits go scotfree.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#117:1>
We allowed the Surat and Chandigarh events to pass us by even as we
allowed the 1947 killings, the 1984 killings in Delhi and other cities, the
killings and blasts in Bombay in 1992-93, and the atrocities against poor
women to pass us by.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#118:1>
The administrative system is becoming increasingly insensitive to
evil by taking shelter under the complex maze of laws.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#119:1>
There is little realisation that it is not sufficient if we perform
our duty; more important, however, is the purpose behind every duty. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#120:1>
<h> SOME DISTURBING TRENDS </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#121:1>
<h> <it> Dismissals of Elected Governments </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#122:1>
The founding fathers of the Constitution worked out a federal
polity as part of an accommodative framework to meet the problems of
ethnolinguistic diversity and to provide greater responsiveness to local
requirements.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#123:1>
Many of the deviations and distortions that took place in the
federal system, especially since the late 1960s, are now too well-known.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#124:1>
Not only has power been centralised in New Delhi, but also
legitimately elected State Governments are dismissed and brought under its
own authority through <w> President's </w> rule.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#125:1>
The result is an increasing, almost pathological imbalance, in the
relationship between the Centre and the states.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#126:1>
<w> India's </w> federal system, which was once able to
compartmentalise social unrest, with political problems often containable
within state boundaries, has of late been weakening with the state leaders
rushing to Delhi and crowding New <w> Delhi's </w> corridors of power to find
solution of problems pertaining to their state.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#127:1>
When demands for autonomy of sub-regions within States are on the
increase, it is necessary to redress the balance between the Centre and the
States, put an end to the arbitrary dismissal of State Governments and
imposition of <w> President's </w> rule and arrange for a more equitable
sharing of revenues.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#128:1>
Otherwise, with the dynamic cross-play of diverse interests,
governance becomes increasingly more complex, testing the threshold of New
Delhi. </p> <3> <h> <it> Relationships Between Political Elites and Some
Civil Servants </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#129:1>
The other disturbing trend is reflected in the patron-client
relations emerging between the political elites and some civil servants.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#130:1>
Several civil servants have acquired reputation that they have
become part of the baggage of their political patrons.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#131:1>
Such nexus leads to wholesale abuse of authority, resulting in
deinstitutionalisation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#132:1>
It makes a mockery of all tasks of equity and rectitude in
governance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#133:1>
Institutions that had a high standing in public image for their
probity are destroyed from within by these moral dwarfs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#134:1>
The political virus spreads to investigative agencies which are the
heart of <O> <&> page </&> 276 </O> the national security system.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#135:1>
There are ample illustrations of the state criminal intelligence
agencies, and even the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI) that go through
the motions of charge-sheeting one set of politicians for grave crimes and
misdemeanours when their opponents are in power only to withdraw the cases
promptly soon after the roles are reversed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#136:1>
Withdrawal of criminal cases, following a change in the party in
power, smacks of a pre-democratic, feudal approach.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#137:1>
The practice has few parallels in the democratic world; it destroys
faith in public order and saps the morale of the police and other
investigative agencies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-003#138:1>
Two other disturbing trends of major deviations from the
constitutional norms are often cited.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#139:1>
The ubiquity of persons with a shady past dominating the composition
of the political class and the rising tide of electoral and other forms of
violence are visible phenomena.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#140:1>
There have been attempts by mafia-type gangs to demand extortion or
protection money, to bribe or terrorise civil servants and police and their
ability to gain immunity from the law since the gangs enjoy the protection of
powerful politicians, including legislators and Ministers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#141:1>
There are mafias connected with illegal mining, timber trade,
illicit liquor distilling, smuggling, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#142:1>
The criminal-politicians nexus helps the latter in committing
electoral malpractices ranging from terrorising voters to rigging and
booth-capturing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#143:1>
Under the impact of black money, powerful politicians are assured of
financiers and a private army of election agents and political mobilisers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-003#144:1>
With the increasing influx of criminals into politics, the process
of <quote> " criminalisation of politics and politicisation of criminals"
</quote> has been facilitated. </p> <footnote> <sp> 1</sp>
