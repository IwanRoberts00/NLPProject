<ICE-IND:S2A-008#2:1:B>
Thank you Baldev <,> East Bengal <,,> play a long ball <,> stay
in their position <,> Majeed <,,> Chapman <,,> Chapman <,> playing away to
the left Sushanu Dey <,,> making room for Chapman <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#3:1:B>
And here Shanti Majumdar <,,> Sushanu replace Vikas Panje <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#4:1:B>
Few minutes to go <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#5:1:B>
Taking attempt to cross from the left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#6:1:B>
East Bengal earn a <?> flag </?> kick <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#7:1:C>
Tushar Rakshit <,,> he is leaving for Sushanu Dey <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#8:1:C>
Dey is uh <,> shirt number six as he positions the ball <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#9:1:C>
He will take that gentle <,,> left footer <,,> which will come <?>
swabing </?> away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#10:1:C>
And ball <,,> by Majumdar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#11:1:C>
Up go Mohun Bagan <,> Gunabir Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#12:1:C>
Long ball on the right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#13:1:C>
And <,,> going for a goal kick <,> in favour of East Bengal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#14:1:C>
Mohun Bagan <,> got a couple of positive chances <,> to forge ahead
<,> again <,,> they haven't succeeded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#15:1:C>
Sushanu Dey <,,> moves here <,,> gently forward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#16:1:C>
Pasha <,,> looks for Chapman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#17:1:C>
He has in the world lot of <,> uh <,> coverage he darts very quick
<,> to this <,,> uh nimble feet <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#18:1:C>
And here is a long range shot <,,> <&> in Hindi </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#19:1:C>
<w> It's </w> going net across <,,> the stadium <,> all through the
Feroz Shah Kotla <,,> cricket ground <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#20:1:C>
So <,,> a new ball <,> has been requisitioned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#21:1:C>
Alok Das <,,> who will take the goal kick now <,,> he instead gets
a pass from Tanomoi Bose <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#22:1:C>
Ranjan Dey <,,> back to Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#23:1:C>
Referee Gulab Chauhan blows the whistle <,,> to stop play because
<,,> suddenly the old ball has also come back into the playing arena <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#24:1:C>
Now the referee will <,,> throw the ball he drops it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#25:1:C>
And East Bengal move out with Sushanu Dey <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#26:1:C>
He is moving very acute on to the left <,> full swing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#27:1:C>
But the ball in any case had gone over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#28:1:C>
Section of the spectators of the ground level <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#29:1:B>
Really that place of the ground level you <,> you just cannot
enjoy <,,> the game of football at that uh <,> level from that eye view <,>
than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper
terraces <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#30:1:A>
<&> In Hindi </&> <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#31:1:C>
Ranjan Dey is header <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#32:1:C>
Butia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#33:1:C>
Rakshit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#34:1:C>
Sushanu Dey <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#35:1:C>
Oh God here the chance <,,> and Sanjay Majhi <,> again ideally
positioned <,,> just above the <O> one word </O> he succeeds in getting the
angle pass Tanomoi Bose <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#36:1:C>
But that angle is <,> a little too much <,,> and the goal just
rolled across <,,> the goal line <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#37:1:C>
Few uh metres away from the uprise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#38:1:C>
So East <w> Bengal's </w> first chance in this second half <,> to
have forged ahead <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#39:1:C>
Watch it again <,,> Sushanu Dey <,> puts the ball ahead <,,> Sanjoy
Majhi runs in <,> from the left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#40:1:C>
Goal keeper Bose turns <,> rushing out <,,> and <,> that angle is
<,,> wide <,> by a few metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#41:1:C>
Majumdar leads the ball for Majhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#42:1:C>
Majhi slow Satyajit gets the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#43:1:C>
Gunabir <,,> gets it to back <,,> down the line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#44:1:C>
Foul committed before the ball rolled out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#45:1:C>
Satyajit <,,> Ancheri <,,> doesn't trap cleanly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#46:1:C>
Tarun De <,,> Biachung Butia <,,> Carlton Chapman <,,> Gunabir
kicks it out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#47:1:C>
Iliyas Pasha <,,> for the throwing for East Bengal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#48:1:C>
Swaroop Das <,,> won't let <,,> Vijayan anywhere close <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#49:1:C>
In the air <,,> the <?> dole </?> won by Alok Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#50:1:C>
This game is also has its <,> highs and lows <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#51:1:C>
The sweet and sours <,,> both the teams having missed out one <,,>
opportunities to <,,> Mohun Bagan as has had <,,> a better share <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#52:1:C>
Dulal Biswas <,,> Butia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#53:1:C>
Butia tackled <,,> by Satyajit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#54:1:C>
<w> It's </w> Sushanu Dey in possession <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#55:1:C>
And <w> it's </w> a faulty forward pass <,,> looking for Majumdar
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#56:1:C>
Swaroop Das <,,> got a very clean ahead <,,> Pasha clears <,,>
taken by Gunabir <,,> waits for the bounce <,,> <w> it's </w> too long <,,>
Chapman puts it out to play <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#57:1:C>
Gunabir <,,> Satyajit Chatterjee <,,> Suryan mark Akeel Ansari <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#58:1:C>
Ancheri <,,> very quick indeed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#59:1:C>
To Ansari Ansari again coming down the middle <,,> cannot get
passed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#60:1:C>
Tarun De <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#61:1:C>
Ansari <,,> very agile player <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#62:1:B>
Despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#63:1:C>
Scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field <,,> ball
running left and right a few yards <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#64:1:C>
Now in Mohun <w> Bagan's </w> possession <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#65:1:C>
And certainly the crowd doesn't like that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#66:1:C>
Supporters of both the teams <,,> present in thousands <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#67:1:C>
The score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four Durand final
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#68:1:C>
Butia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#69:1:C>
Pasha <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#70:1:C>
Yes Sushanu Dey looking for the open <,,> and <,> there is nobody
there for that pass <,> played on the left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#71:1:C>
Nil nil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#72:1:C>
Foul <,,> there uh again <,,> Mohun Bagan <,,> referee Chouhan
going towards <,,> outside right Robin Ghosh giving him bit of warning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#73:1:C>
Swaroop Das it shall be for the free kick <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#74:1:C>
Gently chipping it away onto the left flank <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#75:1:C>
Stopped by Dulal Biswas <,,> the big centre <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#76:1:C>
Alok Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#77:1:C>
Amitabh Chandra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#78:1:C>
Back to Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#79:1:C>
Long ball played <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#80:1:C>
And <,> Akeel Ansari in no mood to oblige Vijayan is on his own way
<,,> Mohun Bagan forward <,,> constantly on the run <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#81:1:C>
Athanu Bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in Vijayan <,,> did the
right thing to come up to the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#82:1:C>
Foul was committed by Vijayan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#83:1:C>
Here comes the <,> a free kick <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#84:1:C>
Tushar Rakshit <,,> dispossessed <,,> Biswas backing up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#85:1:C>
<w> It's </w> uh <?> stretches </?> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#86:1:C>
Twenty-two minutes of the <,> game gone this is the near outpull
eastern stand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#87:1:C>
Very popular <,,> with the football lovers of the city <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#88:1:C>
Oh comes inside the box <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#89:1:C>
Here is the chance for Chapman he raise for the <,,> second bounce
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#90:1:C>
Alok Mukherjee gets to the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#91:1:C>
Butia controls back passing to Swaroop Das <,> back to Butia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#92:1:C>
And Butia <,> again attempt to pass Iliyas pasha who has gone two
yards ahead <,,> acknowledges <,,> to Butia <,,> saying well <,> my fault my
friend in the meanwhile <,,> Mohun Bagan uh <,> defender <,,> Alok Mukherjee
<,,> is on the ground <,,> very close to his own penalty box <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#93:1:C>
Time off has been called by the referee <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#94:1:B>
And gives a little bit of time for uh <,> two players to have
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#95:1:C>
A gulp of water <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#96:1:C>
Those two the uh touch line is the Satyajeet Chatterjee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#97:1:C>
A stretcher being called <,,> Alok Mukherjee <,> going to be taken
out <,,> for first aid <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#98:1:C>
Chatterjee is throwing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#99:1:C>
Ancheri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#100:1:C>
Pasha <,,> now <,> Chapman gets the ball Pasha again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#101:1:C>
Butia <,,> for East Bengal <,> he is <,> quick <,,> but he hold
himself <,> but it is given Butia moves upon to the right Chapman <,> with
the first time pass <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#102:1:B>
And uh <,,> Vikas Panje <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#103:1:C>
Uh Sanjay Majhi that was <,,> unable to control <,> Gunabir
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#104:1:C>
Long ball from Vijayan <,,> Ansari is there <,> Vijayan is quicker
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#105:1:C>
Again with East Bengal <,,> positioned <,,> Swaroop Das <,,>
Iliyas Pasha <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#106:1:C>
Sushanu Dey is ahead <,,> in the dual <,> Ranjan gets the better
<,,> off Majumdar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#107:1:C>
Satyajit Chatterjee <,,> sets up Akeel Ansari <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#108:1:C>
Square pass <,,> Amitabh Chandra <,,> there is it for Gautam Ghosh
<,> the linesman flag goes up for off side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#109:1:C>
Dulal <,,> Mohun Bagan playing with ten <,,> the moment they could
be looking for a substitution <,,> for Alok Mukherjee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#110:1:C>
But no <w> it's </w> not Alok Mukherjee who is going out <,> <w>
it's </w> going to be Bernard who is replacing Gunabir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#111:1:C>
So Bernard is one of the <,,> many important players today donning
<,> the colours of the Calcutta Football Club <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#112:1:C>
It started many years ago <,> with the <,> Iranian <,> then came
the Nigerian <,> and here is Bernand <,> in position for Mohun Bagan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#113:1:C>
East Bengal defence kept back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#114:1:C>
Akil Ansari too much of time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#115:1:C>
And Ancheri <,,> waits for that opportunity Swaroop Das rises to
the occasion <,> but Mohun Bagan again come up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#116:1:C>
Amitabh Chandra now <,,> takes a shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#117:1:C>
It goes wide <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#118:1:C>
East Bengal goal keeper Athanu Bhattacharya <,,> takes the kick
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#119:1:C>
Rakshit fails to stop it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#120:1:C>
Ball to Ghosh <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#121:1:C>
On the right flank gentle chip for Vijayan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#122:1:C>
Vijayan will look for Ancheri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#123:1:C>
Pasha gets to it <,> no he cannot break <,,> the hold of Mohun
Bagan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#124:1:C>
This time Tarun De aheads it away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#125:1:C>
Butia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#126:1:C>
East Bengal at the receiving end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#127:1:C>
Slowly pull the ball out Chapman <,> resting it <,> ones the ball
gone how to play <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#128:1:C>
Alok Mukherjee <,> back onto the playing arena with the throw in
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#129:1:C>
Satyajeet Chatterjee <,,> Akeel Ansari now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#130:1:C>
Pushing forward <,> Amitabh <,,> to a good over lap <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#131:1:C>
In the ball <,> and uh reverse bicycle attempt <,> kick <,,> from
Ancheri <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#132:1:B>
Atanu quiet yet <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#133:1:C>
Behind it <,> was not really in position <,> not in the ideal
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#134:1:C>
So even attempt <,,> trying that reverse <,,> meanwhile a foul
commited <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#135:1:C>
Rakshit <,,> playing square to Pasha <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#136:1:C>
East Bengal fearing to lose <,> the stint <,,> which was evident
earlier on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#137:1:C>
Tanomoi Bose <,> rolling it for Alok Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#138:1:C>
Satyajit Chatterjee <,,> up come Chandra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#139:1:C>
Ansari <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#140:1:C>
Ball to Gautam Ghosh <,,> Dulal Biswas in front of him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#141:1:C>
Ansari again <,> the ball went lose <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#142:1:C>
To the right back Chandra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#143:1:C>
Passes it inside the box <,,> headed out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#144:1:C>
Vijayan now <,,> and Butia gets it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#145:1:C>
He will have to gather speed <,> he will have to give a long ball
through <,,> gives it to Majumdar <,> gives enough of time to the Mohun Bagan
defender to fall back in position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#146:1:C>
Here comes the cross <,,> but the tall Alok Das <,> will have
nothing go pass him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#147:1:C>
Vijayan all over <,> up and down <,> he is like the human machine
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#148:1:C>
He and Ancheri really haven't <,,> stop things going for Mohun
Bagan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#149:1:C>
Swaroop Das <,,> and Tarun De have been outstanding in the deep
present as indeed Iliyas Pasha <,,> Dulal Biswas has been doing a good
overlap on the left for East Bengal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#150:1:C>
Here is Bernard <,> back passing you can see he is giving it away
to East Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#151:1:C>
Majumdar <,,> Chapman <,> Chapman <,> Chatterjee here is Bernard
now for Mohun Bagan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#152:1:C>
Gentle throw to Ancheri <,> Ancheri is crossing <,,> but quiet
harmlessly <,> to Atanu Bhattacharya <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#153:1:C>
Sushanu De <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#154:1:C>
There is a too long <,> Alok Das <,,> Sanjay Majhi <,> one to one
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#155:1:C>
Easily outwitted Satyajit <,> Akeel Ansari <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#156:1:C>
Gautam Ghosh <,> fixed it up closes attack on line <,> Mohun Bagan
looking dangerous now <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#157:1:B>
What you say to that <,> Ancheri <,> with just a goal keeper
to beat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#158:1:B>
With the out step of his left <,,> he doesn't collect <,,> to the
way <,> and expectations <,> of <,,> the Mohun Bagan team man <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#159:1:C>
Here watch it again <,,> a good piece of workmen Gautam Ghosh
<,,> and look at Ancheri <,,> he is all by himself <,> Vijayan has moved up
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#160:1:C>
And all Ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he
prefers his left because <,> probably it is the defender <,> coming in his
view <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#161:1:C>
And he had so much of time <,> and plenty of uh <,> angle as well
<,> to beat the goal keeper <,> wasn't very far <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#162:1:C>
That makes the mess of it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#163:1:C>
So East Bengal survive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#164:1:C>
Nil nil <,,> as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second
half <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#165:1:C>
Yes Mohun Bagans attack again there is going up Ancheri <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#166:1:C>
Well <w> it's </w> a goal <O> applause </O> <,> Oh <O> one word
</O> Ancheri gets the first goal for Mohun Bagan <,,> in the thirty-first
minute of the second half <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#167:1:C>
Movements again from the right <,> warmed it and Mohun Bagan were
looking dominating <,,> looking threatening <,,> as you watch <,,> Gautam
Ghosh on the right <,,> pushes the ball forward <,,> and here is <,> Ancheri
<,,> number eleven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#168:1:C>
This time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#169:1:C>
He outwit <,> the deep defence Swaroop Das as top on the wrong
foot Dulal Biswas is left behind <,> and here comes that whacker <,,> which
is <,,> narrowing the angle <,,> beating goalkeeper Tanu Bhattacharya <,> and
<w> it's </w> one zero for Mohun Bagan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#170:1:C>
So luck eventully running out for East Bengal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#171:1:C>
Ancheri <,,> scoring the first goal <,> drawing the first <,> <O>
two words </O> in the final of the nineteen ninety-four Durand Cup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#172:1:C>
Throwing for Mohun Bagan <,> and for commentory Baldev <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#173:1:A>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-008#174:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> going to be Mohun Bagan for the kick off
with Vijayan <,> back passing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#175:1:B>
Akeel Ansari <,,> he is just behind <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-008#176:1:B>
