<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#1:1:A>
It is heard that uh <,,> Telephone Exchange <,> at Khadaklat
has been commissioned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#2:1:A>
And <,,> the trunk dial facility <,,> or the S T D facility has been

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#3:1:B>
Extended to all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#4:1:A>
Extended

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#5:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#6:1:A>
That uh exchange <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#7:1:B>
In fact

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#8:1:A>
In how many years <,> this programme will continue <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#9:1:B>
Uh actually sir now government is <,,> trying to <,,> trying
very fast <,,> to automize all these exchanges <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#10:1:B>
Now there are no manually <,,> operated exchanges <,> left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#11:1:B>
Only a few exchanges say I can <,> uh say Athani and in Chikodi
they are <,> having manual exchange <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#12:1:B>
Rest all exchanges are converted into auto <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#13:1:B>
Now this <,> Khadaklat exchange is <,> recently connected <,> I
mean <,,> it is <,> uh it was made auto <,> before a few years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#14:1:B>
But now <,> this is <,> connected with S T D facility <,,> so that
people of Khadaklat <,,> need not depend upon Nipani <,> telephone exchange

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#15:1:A>
Telephone exchange you mean

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#16:1:B>
And uh Nipani telephone operators <,> for getting their calls
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#17:1:B>
Number of times <,> uh what they find as Nipani do not answer <,>
operators do not answer <,,> and their calls are heavely delayed and all that
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#18:1:B>
And since now it is <,,> linked with S T Ds <,> <w> subscriber's
</w> dialing <,> facility <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#19:1:B>
Uh they are much pleased <,,> that uh they will <,> themselves dial
<,,> all the numbers of Nipani as well as <,> uh numbers of any state <,> <}>
<-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> or of any city they like <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#20:1:A>
Question is about uh <,,> the system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#21:1:A>
Previously it was the manual <,,> exchange so to say <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#22:1:B>
Which one

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#23:1:B>
Khadaklat

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#24:1:A>
Khadaklat Nipani <,,> are these <,> uh the small exchanges <,>
were uh automatic exchanges

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#25:1:B>
Yes sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#26:1:A>
But the big exchanges just like Nipani Chikkodi <,> Sankeshwar
<,> sometimes say even <,,> uh Kolhapur was also <,> once upon a time <,>
manually <.> di </.>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#27:1:B>
Operated <{> <[> exchange </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#28:1:A>
<[> Operated </[> </{> exchange <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#29:1:A>
But at this stage means I want to say that automization will not
<,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,,> uh uhm what I mean to say is <,,> harm the <,> society
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#30:1:A>
But at the same time what about the <,> <{2> <[2> staff <,> staff
and excess staff and <,> other uh <,,> facilities <,,> that are uh needed

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#31:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#32:1:B>
<[2> Staff </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#33:1:A>
Especially <,,> there are some <,> persons who require <,> S T
D facility <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#34:1:A>
And there are some who do not want the S T D facility <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#35:1:A>
So even though they are uh automization <,> still the staff is
needed <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#36:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#37:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#38:1:A>
Uhn <,> and here <,> again <,> there is possibility of <,> uh
getting <,> late connections <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#39:1:A>
Sometimes <,> uh <,> <{> <[> no answer <,> no answer like that <,>
<O> one word </O> in what <,> in this connection what your are saying <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#40:1:B>
<[> No answer </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#41:1:B>
No sir <,> see when these exchanges were manually operated <,>
for all these years <,,> there the supposing the <.> exch </.> there are
about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#42:1:B>
Manual operation is just possible <,> by one or two operators <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#43:1:B>
But when the numbers increased <,> say to to one thousand two
thousand <,> so A to B B to C these

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#44:1:A>
No no I accept I accept your difficulties <,> <{> <[> no <,>
or what I mean to say is <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#45:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#46:1:B>
Ahn ha ha

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#47:1:A>
Now automization is nice thing I accept <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,>
but there are certain <,> <{2> <[2> loop holes <,> connect uhm complaints <,>
<{3> <[3> uhm <,> regarding the telephone bills <,,> for example day before
yesterday I had been <,> in <,,> Kolhapur Telephone <indig> Bhavan </indig>
<,> <{4> <[4> ah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#48:1:A>
And there one person came and he complained <,> that his bill has
been uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#49:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#50:1:B>
<[2> Loop holes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#51:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#52:1:B>
<[4> Ah </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#53:1:B>
Over excess bill <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#54:1:A>
Not excess

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#55:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#56:1:A>
It was too much <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#57:1:B>
Too much

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#58:1:A>
It was about uh fifty thousand <indig> rupees </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#59:1:A>
And he complained that even though suppose I started <,> the
subscriber trunk dialing continuously <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> the bill will not
<,> <{> <[> uh uh uh </[> will not be of uh such <,> uh great extent

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#60:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#61:1:B>
<[> Come so much </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#62:1:A>
So it is a mechanic fault I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#63:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#64:1:A>
So <{> <[> this connection </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#65:1:B>
<[> Ha yes sir </[> </{> <,> there is every possibility of <,>
of having a mechanical fault <,> with a telephone meter as such

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#66:1:A>
Uhm exactly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#67:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> you see there are clear instructions in
our <,> directory <,> uh when the automachine is made <,> that uh when the
subscriber establishes his call <,> and speaks for a minute or two minutes
<,> he has to disconnect and see that he does get a dial tone back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#68:1:B>
So that he <,> comes to know that his telephone is disconnected
from S T D

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#69:1:A>
S T D facility

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#70:1:A>
<{1> <[1> Accepted </[1> sir even though the same thing has been
<,> <{2> <[2> followed </[2> properly <,> <{> <[> uhn <,> still your bills
are <,> so high <,> that we feel that it is better to disconnect the
telephone connection

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#71:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#72:1:B>
<[2> Done done by </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#73:1:B>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#74:1:B>
Uh ha no doubt <,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#75:1:B>
This is a very rare case sir

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#76:1:B>
In that case subsriber <}> <-> got </-> <=> has got </=> </}> every
right <,> to approach the <,> <{2> <[2> higher authority <,> higher authority
department <,> even the court <,> and he does get uh the <,> reembursement of
all that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#77:1:A>
<[1> Uhn </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#78:1:A>
<[2> Higher authority </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#79:1:A>
But on what ground do you <,> uh settle this case <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#80:1:B>
The grounds <,> you see we will test that <,> subscribers
meter <,,> and if he will

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#81:1:A>
At your end <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#82:1:B>
At our end

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#83:1:A>
But at the same time <,> <{> <[> uhn <,> what I mean to say
<,> you may test it but in this <,,> case or say in a particular case <,> you
must call that particular gentleman <,> who has complained

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#84:1:B>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#85:1:B>
Yes yes yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#86:1:A>
And in <,> <{> <[> in his presence </[> <,> you must check it
and you must convince him <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> that uh the meter it was faulty
or meter is correct like that

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#87:1:A>
Do you <,> have such facility

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#88:1:A>
And do you such have these actions or

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#89:1:B>
<[> His presence only </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#90:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#91:1:B>
No we don't sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#92:1:B>
In this case <,> we don't call the subscriber <,> but the
department tests the <,> meter of the subscriber <,> who has got a complaint
as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#93:1:B>
And we will in this case supposing now there are automization <}>
<-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> uh recently started <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#94:1:B>
Supposing this had started a year before <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#95:1:B>
In that case <,> we send bills every two <.> min </.> uh every two
months <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#96:1:B>
We will see their history of the <,,> uh subscriber

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#97:1:A>
No he says <indig> na </indig> he says that <,> we have
brought the bills <,> for the last two years

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#98:1:B>
Ha two years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#99:1:A>
And it was not more <,> it was not more than for three hundred
<indig> rupees </indig> a month <,> say uh for two for a period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#100:1:A>
And it this time it was more than fifty thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#101:1:B>
Ha <}> <-> if if </-> <=> if </=> </}> that is the case
subscriber I told you <,> subscriber has got every right to <,> to complain

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#102:1:A>
No no question of right over here

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#103:1:B>
And now the now the redressal office complaint is like this
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#104:1:B>
We will test then <,> meter <,> his number meter will be tested
<,> and uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#105:1:A>
See question is <,> sir <,> whether do you test that meter in
front of the consumer or the customer

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#106:1:A>
That is what happens because <,> <{> <[> we <,> he must be <,> you
may say that our uh our read <,> no you may say that our reading is correct

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#107:1:B>
<[> We </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#108:1:B>
Uhn sir no doubt uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#109:1:A>
Because <,> you do not want to <,> take the responsibility of
your fault <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#110:1:B>
See <{> <[> we have </[> got to take the responsibility of
the fault

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#111:1:A>
<[> And that is </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#112:1:A>
Do you take it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#113:1:B>
See when the metre

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#114:1:A>
Does the department take it

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#115:1:A>
I don't think that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#116:1:B>
See the department has to take sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#117:1:B>
<}> <-> It </-> <=> it </=> </}> will take

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#118:1:A>
Just see <{> <[> has to take it different and takes </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#119:1:B>
<[> See <}> <-> there is </-> <=> there is </=> </}> one rule
</[> </{> in the department sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#120:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#121:1:B>
There is one rule <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#122:1:B>
Whatever bill is <.> recei </.> received by the subscriber he has
to pay first the bill

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#123:1:A>
Exactly what I mean to I want to come to that uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#124:1:B>
Since <,> <{1> <[1> uh <,> since <}> <-> this </-> <=> this
</=> </}> is an absurd bill <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> say of fifty thousand as
you say <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,> which he was getting for three hundred four
hundred <indig> rupees </indig> <,> or say a maximum thousand <indig> rupees
</indig> <,> <{4> <[4> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#125:1:B>
When he receives the bill of five fifty thousand <,> definitely
<,,> there is <,,> <{5> <[5> wrong <,> something wrong with the meter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#126:1:B>
He has got to uh he has definitely complained <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#127:1:B>
His complained will be <O> one word </O> to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#128:1:A>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#129:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#131:1:A>
<[4> Uhm </[4> </{4>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#132:1:A>
<[5> Wrong </[5> </{5>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#133:1:A>
Uhn without uh asking for the deposition <,> uh of that uh
amount

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#134:1:B>
Uhm no in this case <,> here as per the rules he has to <{>
<[> pay </[> fine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#135:1:A>
<[> Pay </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#136:1:B>
But uh I don't think the <}> <-> subscriber </-> <=>
subscriber </=> </}> will pay fifty thousand

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#137:1:B>
<{> <[> He has no <O> one or two words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#138:1:A>
<[> He will not be in a </[> </{> position to pay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#139:1:B>
He will be not in a position to pay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#140:1:B>
Perhaps he has not paid the bill <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> and his
complaint will be <,> dealt with <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> in <,> in due course

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#141:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#142:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#143:1:B>
Now we were talking about auto automization isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#144:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#145:1:B>
<O> Cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#146:1:B>
No doubt <,> this automization <,> has resulted in reduction of
staff <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#147:1:B>
There is a difficulty with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#148:1:B>
We were about <,> say thirty thirty-five operators in at Nipani
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#149:1:B>
Since the automization before a year <,> the staff is reduced by
ten people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#150:1:B>
So ten people are reduced <,> we are now twenty people working <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#151:1:B>
Now this <,,> <}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+> </}> called <,> uh <.>
sma </.> small <,> <{> <[> auto key <,> uh auto key centre

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#152:1:A>
<[> Auto key </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#153:1:B>
Where each switch are connected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#154:1:B>
They are also automized <,> and linked with S <,> S T D

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#155:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#156:1:B>
And <,> now the problem with us is <,> there will be no
booking of <,> of calls at all <,> by Akol Benkihal and <,> uh Khadaklat <,>
which are <}> <-> slowing </-> <+> slowly </+> </}> being automized <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#157:1:B>
And they will have to deal I mean oh <,> depend on the Nipani <,>
<{> <[> exchange <,> manual operators

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#158:1:A>
<[> Exchange </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#159:1:A>
And <w> it's </w> manual operater like

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#160:1:B>
Ha that difficulty is there for us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#161:1:B>
No doubt people are people uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#162:1:A>
No <,> just see what happens no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#163:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#164:1:A>
They say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#165:1:B>
People <,> see people want their facility always <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#166:1:B>
Supposing if we get a telephone connection here <,> I mean the
connection <,> and if we can dial a numeric <,> number in America England <,>
or Delhi <,> Japan <,> <{> <[> some any any <,> you definitely you want all
these facilities isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#167:1:A>
<[> Some any any </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#168:1:B>
But uh you don't worry whether there is <w> there'll </w> be
<.> autom </.> I mean reduction of staff or something of like that

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#169:1:B>
You need not bother about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#170:1:B>
The department has to bother about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#171:1:B>
The department is now thinking <,> the operators to absorb in some
other departments <,> and uh <w> they'll </w> be posted <}> <-> to some </->
<=> to some </=> </}> booths <,> or <,> uhm <w> they'll </w> be taken as
clerks <,> <}> <-> in the </-> <=> in the </=> </}> various departments <,>
that is going on <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#172:1:A>
No no I am not to concern about <,> uh your difficult <,> <{>
<[> of course not <,,> I am talking of the <,> difficulties of the consumer
or the customer

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#173:1:B>
<[> Of course not </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#174:1:B>
<{> <[> No no I </[> tell you uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#175:1:A>
<[> For example </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#176:1:B>
Now since the <,> automization is made <,> people are really
very happy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#177:1:B>
They need not book the call to Nipani Exchange

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#178:1:A>
And wait for the call <{> <[> and uh depend upon the
operators </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#179:1:B>
<[> Wait now supposing now </[> </{> the difficulty is that
<,> everybody supposing <w> subscriber's </w> at Khadaklat <,> they dial each
other <,> <w> they'll </w> be getting engage to each other

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#180:1:B>
<}> <-> They will </-> <=> they will </=> </}> keep mum <,> for a
certain while <,> so the only facility is <,> they will dial once again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#181:1:B>
They will dial try twice thrice four times

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#182:1:B>
Then they will get each other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#183:1:B>
They will <,> you see get the connection <,> they feel very happy
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#184:1:B>
They are really very happy no doubt <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#185:1:B>
Now <,> uh definitely as I say <,> that subscribers are

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#186:1:A>
What I mean to say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#187:1:B>
Ha

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#188:1:A>
So those who have got <,> there are two <.> ch </.> uhm I
have two categories in my mind

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#189:1:B>
Yeah yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#190:1:A>
One <,> those who are subscribers of that is one <,> <{> <[>
uhm <,> with S T D facility

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#191:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#192:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#193:1:A>
Those <,> who have who have got the connections <,> without
subscribers <,> uh uh <,> <{> <[> S T D <,> S T D

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#194:1:B>
<[> S T D </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#195:1:B>
Without <w> S T D's </w> <w> there're </w> some pople are <,>
<{> <[> uh <,> see S T D <,> is a subscriber dialing <,> uh facility

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#196:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#197:1:A>
Ha

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#198:1:B>
You have got a telephone at home

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#199:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#200:1:B>
When you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody
<,> <{> <[> yeah yeah <,> <w> they'll </w> dial the number

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#201:1:B>
They go on speaking

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#202:1:B>
Ladies if this start speaking no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#203:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#204:1:A>
Yeah they don't know <,> uhm the technique of <,> using the S
T D

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#205:1:B>
I see I see <,> because it is to be used by second to second
<O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#206:1:B>
S T D is a facility <,> generally useful for the subscribers <,>
who can <,> uh minimise their conversation for a minute or so say <,> thirty
seconds even forty seconds <,> or a minute also <,> and stop it

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#207:1:B>
So that <,> previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five
<indig> rupees </indig> for a Bombay call <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#208:1:B>
If they finish up you say when <,> twenty-five thirty seconds <,>
it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-018#209:1:B>
They get it <,> <{> <[> within two thousand </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#210:1:A>
<[> No I I know this </[> </{> I know this <,> <{> <[> ha ha
<,> uh procedure

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#211:1:B>
<[> Ha ha </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#212:1:A>
Question is <,> those who do not want that S T D facility

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#213:1:B>
Uh they have to come and book the call

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#214:1:A>
<{> <[> Isn't that isn't that </[> and here again the manual
labour <,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,> comes into <,> uhm <,> <{2> <[2> focus <,>
picture <,> in the picture uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#215:1:B>
<[> Ha uh uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#216:1:B>
<[1> Uhn </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#217:1:B>
<[2> Focus </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-018#218:1:A>
And uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber </I>
