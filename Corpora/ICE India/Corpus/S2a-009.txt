<ICE-IND:S2A-009#1:1:A>
Hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth One Day
International between India <,> and the West Indies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#2:1:A>
India <,> were leading two one <,> before the match <,> at the
Barabati stadium Cuttuck <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#3:1:A>
The West Indies desperately needing to <,> win here <,,> to level
off the series at two all <,> and to make it <,> a real live affair <,> for
the fifth <mention> One Day International </mention> at Jaipur which follows
on Friday <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#4:1:A>
The West Indies made one change <,> beside that it lost at Vizag <,>
they dropped Barrington Browne and preferred to strengthen their batting <,>
bringing in <,> Shivnarine Chanderpaul <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#5:1:A>
India <,,> had to drop Navjot Siddhu who was injured and brought in
Atul Bedade <,> but surprisingly <,> they brought back Chetan Sharma <,> in
place of <,> Venkatesh Prasad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#6:1:A>
It was a cloudy morning <,> when Courtney Walsh the West Indian
captain won the toss and elected to bat <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#7:1:A>
We pick up the play <,> of the very first ball of the morning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#8:1:A>
<w> It's </w> Manoj Prabhakar <,> bowling to Phil Simmons <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#9:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#10:1:C>
West <,,> <w> it's </w> fascinating structure there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#11:1:C>
People standing on the balconies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#12:1:C>
Looking end of the side screen <,,> like the centre piece of
pavilion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#13:1:C>
<w> That's </w> gone away <,> for four runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#14:1:C>
Simmons aiming it well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#15:1:C>
Striking it at off the space just behind square <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#16:1:C>
That was <,> favourite cut of Simmons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#17:1:C>
A cut short <,,> centre wide <,> there is two ways of cutting one
with the <,> horizontal bat and one with perpendicular <,,> that was the <,>
perpendicular <,,> way of playing the square cut <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#18:1:C>
<w> It's </w> straight away to Azharuddin there in the gully

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#19:1:C>
That was an exotic catch <,> Phil went into the trap and it went
straight away <,,> to Azhar

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#20:1:D>
Quite difficult to tell really <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#21:1:D>
Simmons got back really and <,,> hit it <,> very hard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#22:1:D>
Here <,,> I had seen that was a catch

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#23:1:D>
Indeed <,> Azharuddin <,,> a very <?> agile </?> normally was
amongst <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#24:1:C>
That end up <,> very very powerful over

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#25:1:C>
Azharuddin had <,,> had to go to his <,> right <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#26:1:E>
This is a good start by the West Indies because uh <,> there
was a quite a bit of moment <,> early on <,> uh in this wicket and uh <,,>
the two of them have counted that very well <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#27:1:C>
Great shot there by Simmons <,,> like he go for <,,> runs <,>
four runs <,> square cut <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#28:1:E>
That really is a trademark shot of uh <,> Simmons uh <,> shot
<,> a little bit of width <,,> being a tall man <,,> standing up here <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#29:1:D>
That balls are by Chetan giving Williams all those to play his
shot back foot <,> cover drive

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#30:1:D>
Four runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#31:1:D>
Williams particularly is very good at shot <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#32:1:E>
Well he gave that a fair old whack uh <,,> that Steuart
Williams <,,> a ball to be head short <,> and on a wicket <,> of this nature
now with the <,> uh ball not coming on to the bat <,> <w> that's </w> a free
hand for the batsman specially the West Indian batsman with such good
backfoot there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#33:1:E>
There <w> he's </w> given it a fair old thump <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#34:1:C>
Could be out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#35:1:C>
Yes he is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#36:1:C>
Good catch by Manoj <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#37:1:C>
<w> That's </w> a generous <,> really happy and very good well
judged that <,> catch by Manoj there

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#38:1:C>
Running back a little bit <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#39:1:C>
And there <w> William's </w> gone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#40:1:C>
First wicket for India <,> and to Chetan Sharma <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#41:1:E>
Williams not getting on top of that short ball I think he was
beaten a little bit by pace here and <,> uh hurried on to him and uh <,,>
ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and Manoj
Prabhakar here running around taking a good catch <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#42:1:E>
That will do Chetan Sharma as a morale world of good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#43:1:E>
Caught Prabhakar <,> bowled Sharma for fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#44:1:E>
<w> That's </w> more of a desperate shot stepping out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#45:1:E>
Uh but well played <,,> outside a square drive stepping out

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#46:1:E>
<w> That's </w> a very good shot to play <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#47:1:E>
Four runs there <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#48:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#49:1:C>
In the air but <w> it's </w> safe <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#50:1:C>
Lara not trying to bow <,> but <w> he've </w> still soon then

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#51:1:C>
But <w> he's </w> gone off fast on it <,> for that to go away <,>
for four runs <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#52:1:D>
Sharma now to Hooper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#53:1:D>
Jadeja was giving his side he is out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#54:1:D>
What a brilliant throw and uh <,> a very well field <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#55:1:D>
Hooper does is out

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#56:1:D>
What a marvellous piece of cricket from Jadeja <,> but careless by
Hooper who was very <O> one word </O> to walk about like that <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#57:1:C>
Certainly very very careless and another wicket of West Indies
could not afford to lose <,> particular Hooper being run out

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#58:1:C>
Hooper has been playing so well <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#59:1:C>
And that is uh <,> uh uh <,> for a big support for the West Indies
team <,> uhm <,,> Hooper there playing the ball <,> uh to a shot mid-wicket
<,> just taken off <,> and <,> Jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a
lovely throw hit the wicket on time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#60:1:C>
Seventy-seven for three <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#61:1:D>
<w> It's </w> straight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#62:1:D>
<w> It's </w> another good short there by <,> Lara <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#63:1:D>
Shrinath is the fielder

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#64:1:D>
Coming back <,> for the second <,> and it was fast throw <,,> but
<,> not out says the umpire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#65:1:D>
But this Indian team so certainly <,> hit in the stumps from all
over the field <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#66:1:D>
Uh again that could have been pretty close <,> if Lara played it to
mid-wicket <,,> and <,> and <,> Shrinath run <,> run they have taken up and a
lovely throw in <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#67:1:D>
See there Lara <,,> is in there just in time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#68:1:D>
Once again he has to chase the run he won't get that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#69:1:D>
It was played very fine by Lara <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#70:1:D>
Late and fine <,> and nicely controlled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#71:1:D>
In the air and a big appeal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#72:1:D>
No says the umpire Mr Jose Kurushinkal that came off the pad <,,>
so <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#73:1:D>
Have a look at that one again <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#74:1:D>
Another particularly good shot <,,> and <,> up <,> and uh <,> very
good decision <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#75:1:D>
Well <w> that's </w> the edge <w> it's </w> four runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#76:1:D>
All is fair in love and war as they say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#77:1:D>
The end of the over <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#78:1:D>
Twenty-four overs and <w> it's </w> ninety-nine <,> for three <,,>
<O> applaud and whistles </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#79:1:D>
So Lara well he is beginning to <,,> make a significant score even
though he work on the score is <,> many of his runs made <O> one word </O>
like that <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#80:1:C>


<ICE-IND:S2A-009#81:1:C>
And another fielder at the other end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#82:1:C>
<w> It's </w> <O> one word </O> to time <,,> again the counter term
with the mis field by Anil Kumble <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#83:1:D>
Well he did that well for four

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#84:1:D>
It was a lovely shot <,,> moving freely into the half volly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#85:1:D>
Kumble now to Lara <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#86:1:D>
Well that was delicately played <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#87:1:D>
And that is gone away <,> for four runs <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#88:1:D>
Just about as fine as you could get it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#89:1:D>
Kumble now to Arthurton <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#90:1:D>
And that runs for Arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four
there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#91:1:D>
It does <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#92:1:D>
So a productive over for <,> the West Indies

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#93:1:D>
Twenty-five overs have gone <,> <w> it's </w> a hundred and
thirteen <,> for three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#94:1:D>
And <w> that's </w> beautifully played by Lara <,> wide across at
short fine leg <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#95:1:C>
Four more <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#96:1:D>
Runs certainly coming in <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#97:1:E>
Very good running between the wicket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#98:1:E>
Excellent <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#99:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#100:1:C>
<w> That's </w> a lovely shot there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#101:1:C>
And over the top <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#102:1:C>
six runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#103:1:C>
Brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime <,>
from the last over <,> he has been successful now <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#104:1:D>
<w> It's </w> Arthurton facing Raju <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#105:1:C>
Uh that should be a close one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#106:1:C>
Uh I thought he played right across the line Ravi <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#107:1:E>
Here the ball is spinning so <,> <w> it's it's </w> not easy
for Raju to <,> get a leg before decision unless <w> it's </w> <,,> <w> it's
</w> a straight throw as you can see its pitched outside the line and uh <,,>
the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#108:1:C>
Umpire has given him out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#109:1:C>
It was a magnificient catch <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#110:1:C>
<.> Arthur </.> Arthurton <,> stepping out <,> stepping down <,>
from the <O> one word </O> end <,> was a big <O> one word </O> and bat back
<,> caught brilliantly by Mongia <,,> at just silly mid on <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#111:1:D>
Straight drive beautiful shot all the way <,> almost going to
the boundary

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#112:1:D>
Yes it is <,,> long on boundary wide off long on <,> fielder had
no chance <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#113:1:C>
Very good shot there by Brian <,> Lara <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#114:1:D>
Square cut there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#115:1:D>
Lara <,> Lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for
four runs <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#116:1:E>
There again brilliant paceman <,> <w> that's </w> a <,> bad
ball from Raju giving Lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to
waste uh <,> deliveries of that kind there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#117:1:E>
Playing it late and beating the fielder at <,> deep point giving
him absolutely no chance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#118:1:E>
Like I said this is a much better Brian Lara you are seeing <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#119:1:D>
Stepping down before the ball is delivered <,> straight down
and well fielded

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#120:1:D>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#121:1:D>
Yes it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#122:1:D>
Just inside the boundary line well done by Raju <,> once again
just two runs <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#123:1:E>
Raju in the end doing well <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#124:1:E>
To stop the ball just inside the fence <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#125:1:D>
Oh <,,> there and he is out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#126:1:D>
Umpire has given him out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#127:1:D>
Wicket keeper umpire <w> that's </w> a good skill <,> good piece
of keeping by Mongia <,> who picked up all the loss done by and uh <,,> and
this Lara being stumped <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#128:1:D>
Stumped Mongia <,,> bowled <,,> Kumble <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#129:1:E>
Ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by Nain Mongia
because Brian Lara <,> slipped a bit when he played that shot and just
dragged his leg <,> outside as uh <,,> you would be able to see here

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#130:1:E>
There you see <,> just dragging and Mongia in a flash <,,> and his
leg is <,> just an inch outside the crease maybe even on the line but <w>
that's </w> out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#131:1:E>
<{> <[> A good </[> decision by the umpire there <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#132:1:D>
<[> But that is </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#133:1:D>
End of the thirty ninth over

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#134:1:D>
West Indies are one ninety one for five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#135:1:D>
And <,> the new batsman coming in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#136:1:D>
Should be Chanderpaul <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#137:1:C>
Batsman <O> one word </O> Chanderpaul hasn't played a match
after the Bombay <,> one day <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#138:1:C>
And he should be replacing Lara <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#139:1:C>
Left hander replacing another left hander <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#140:1:E>
Very important wicket for India that because <,> Lara was
looking extremely dangerous <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#141:1:E>
He is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had
uh <,,> still another fourteen overs to go <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#142:1:D>
<w> That's </w> way he was out <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#143:1:C>
High play and he is given out

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#144:1:C>
Yes <,> going right across the line of delivery <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#145:1:C>
And again umpire Jayprakash <,> giving Chanderpaul out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#146:1:C>
L B W bowled Jadeja <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#147:1:E>
Funny all this game can change uh <,> you lose the wicket
<,,> when side is cruising

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#148:1:E>
And now here again Chanderpaul playing across the line <,,> to
delivery from Jadeja that was coming in and <,> paying the penalty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#149:1:E>
Wide of the crease Jadeja angling at it <,> and as you can see
<,,> Chanderpaul <O> one word </O> is not playing across <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#150:1:C>
Score one ninety-two for six now West Indies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#151:1:C>
<w> That's </w> well played there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#152:1:C>
And Manoj <,> shot that by just like stepping for the going near
the ball and four runs all the way <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#153:1:E>
With two fielders they are pretty close to each other <,> the
man at short third and backward point <,> there is a very little gap there
<,> but uh <,> Holder placing the ball to perfection <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#154:1:E>
He was waiting on it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#155:1:E>
And at the very last minute tabbing it down <,> and placing it
beautifully past Manoj Prabhakar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#156:1:E>
Once it beaten <,> the other fielders had absolutely no chance
<,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#157:1:D>
<w> That's </w> wide over there <,,> and <,> Manoj Prabhakar
alternate

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#158:1:D>
Yes he has gone in there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#159:1:D>
A simple catch Manoj Prabhakar at long on <,,> and Junior Murray
is out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#160:1:D>
Caught Prabhakar <,,> bowled Jadeja <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#161:1:E>
Trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in
to bat uh <,> and <w> it's </w> <,> gather shot by uh Murray <,> because he
needed to give his senior partner <,> Holder as much of the strike as
possible

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#162:1:E>
There was no need for a short of this kind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#163:1:E>
There is still over fifty balls to play and West Indies should be
trying and picking up uh <,> the single ones and twos and allowing uh <,>
Holder to do <,,> face on the the bowling because uh <,,> losing wickets at
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#164:1:C>
The score is two hundred and two for seven <,> West Indies
<,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#165:1:D>
Jadeja to Holder <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#166:1:D>
<w> That's </w> in the air <,> <w> it's </w> going over the top
for six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#167:1:D>
Uh <,,> Kambli also has gone over the top <,,> uh he was unable as
well <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#168:1:C>
He has some of the gut shot uh <,> before he picks it up
early <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#169:1:D>
Gone into position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#170:1:D>
So <w> it's </w> going to be <,,> Kumble now to bowl to Andy
Cummins <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#171:1:D>
Cummins is gone <,> he is given out <,> he was <?> sweeping </?>
there and uh <,> the umpire uh <,,> Mr Kurushinkal has turned out there so
Cummins is on his way <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#172:1:C>
Uh that fell well <,,> whether we take that probably just at
the outside of the off stump <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#173:1:C>
No one is certain as to what happen <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#174:1:C>
Uh except obviously the wicket keeper Mongia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#175:1:C>
The bail is off <,> and Walsh is gone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#176:1:C>
He has asked the Indian perhaps they said well <O> one word </O>
and very <,> unspendidly he has taken that word for it and he is out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#177:1:C>
Well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right
cover in the wicket <,,> and just pushing at the ball <,,> as you can see
there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#178:1:C>
And it seems that it his pad in the way

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#179:1:C>
But <w> it's </w> <,> probably just <,,> took the <,,> outside
edge of the stumps <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#180:1:C>
Yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is <,> away
back and you see the man in there <,,> and <,,> two twenty-eight for nine
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#181:1:C>
<O> One word </O> uhm <,,> Shrinath again to Holder <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#182:1:D>
Oh is it that may be a mild <,,> but he didn't picked this
well

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#183:1:D>
<w> It's </w> well fielded by Kumble <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#184:1:D>
Shrinath now to <,> <O> one word </O> Cuffy <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#185:1:C>
Another full toss he played it before <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#186:1:C>
Well that was perfectly played and it takes Cuffy to nine <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#187:1:D>
He couldn't have played that very safe

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#188:1:C>
Well I think that Cuffy can raise and walk in <,,> and Hooper
<,,> because Hooper played that <,> similiar kind of shot when he <,,> played
in the last game

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#189:1:C>
When he went inside to the full toss

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#190:1:C>
And that was a lovely shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#191:1:C>
As you can see Cuffy gets an inside there <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#192:1:D>
He played that didn't he <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#193:1:D>
Uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#194:1:C>
Cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#195:1:C>
Umpire examining <O> two words </O> I think so <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#196:1:D>
Cuffy <,> but <w> it's </w> a get down on target out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#197:1:D>
I got some uh <,> upon the hot shot like uh <,> I got some
sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#198:1:D>
He never scored more than singles so he <,,> reaching his <,> top
score as fifteen runs <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#199:1:D>
Last ball being bowled now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-009#200:1:D>
Oh he is obviously over there going for single oh <,> <O> laughs
</O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-009#201:1:C>
And I tell you what Prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the
when that ball hit the wicket <,> </I>
