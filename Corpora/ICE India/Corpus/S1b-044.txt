<ICE-IND:S1B-044#1:1:A>
Newly elected A I A D M K member of parliament <,> from
Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu <,> Mr Shekhar is an advocate by profession and <w>
he's </w> a <w> party's </w> district secretary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#2:1:A>
Mr Shekhar welcome to our studio <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#3:1:B>
Thank you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#4:1:A>
Tell us Mr Shekhar <,> <{> <[> ah <,> how do <+> you </+>
attribute the right of regional <}> <-> <.> po </.> </-> <=> parties </=>
</}> <,> in <w> India's </w> body politics <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#5:1:B>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#6:1:B>
You see in India <,,> there is uh <,> plenty of languages <,,>
and uh <,,> plenty of uh <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <,> <=> regional </=> </}>
<?> I </?> just like that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#7:1:B>
Even though in this <,> uh type of uh <,,> our nation <,> because we
<+> are </+> having many differences and many communal individual parties
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#8:1:B>
We refuse <?> to save </?> integration and <,,> to our India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#9:1:B>
Then this is you see <,> many peoples are there peoples living or
having many languages <,,> and uh <,,> many cultures like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#10:1:B>
This way the only regional parties <,,> which are reflecting the
<,,> regional peoples culture <,,> and their uh <,> uh cultures and their <,>
views <,> through that regional <,> parties only gain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#11:1:B>
And so the regional party is having just a close relationship which
is basically <,> with that uh people <,> the regional peoples <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#12:1:B>
You know now-a-days you see that only the Congress have <}> <->
such </-> <=> much </=> </}> of approach to the <,,> uh uh throughout
national vein <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#13:1:B>
No other party is rather having that much of <,,> approach <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#14:1:B>
Anyhow our A I A D M K Anna D M K <,,> which is led by our <indig>
puratchithalaivi </indig> Ms Jayalalitha <,,> or Madam <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#15:1:B>
Uh is having the party <,> in uh yes and many states <,> in Andhra
<,> Karnataka <,,> in Pondicherry <,> as well as now in uh <,> our capital
New Delhi itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#16:1:B>
So that not only the regional parties are developing in other
states our other regions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#17:1:B>
Uh <w> they're </w> also having the confidence of the regional <}>
<-> <.> pe </.> </-> <=> peoples </=> </}> <,> that uh <,> <w> they're </w>
reflecting that uh <,> views and angles <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#18:1:B>
So only the regional parties can built the <,> uh views and the
imagines or anything <w> you've </w> <+> to </+> take <,> <-> of </-> the
peoples opinion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#19:1:B>
Uh so <,> uh the regional parties are <,> in our country just like
our country democratical country <,> <w> we're </w> giving the <,> freedoms
to regional parties <,> in one way

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#20:1:B>
<}> <-> In </-> <+> From </+> </}> another angle <,> the regional
parties are <,> uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our
nation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#21:1:A>
But do you think that regional parties have the same vision
<,> as the national party ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#22:1:B>
Certainly <,> because <,> <w> they're </w> having the same
interest of uh <,> uh national uh <,> national parties interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#23:1:B>
You know that our M G R our beloved leader <,> in the time of war
war time of China <,> he donated <w> he's </w> the first <-> it was the </->
man <,> who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a
<indig> lakh </indig> uh <,> to our late Prime Minister <indig> Pandit
</indig> Jawaharlal Nehru <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#24:1:B>
He donated a huge amount

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#25:1:B>
Nobody <,> <}> <-> under </-> <+> at </+> </}> that time nobody <,>
donated such amount <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#26:1:B>
<?> Whereas </?> he was in the regional party under this <,> he
donated uh too much of high amount <,> to our Prime Minister for integration

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#27:1:A>
But do you think that the regional party is <,> they you know
integrate the federal structure

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#28:1:B>
Certainly because <,> regional party is having the same view
on <O> one word </O> there

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#29:1:B>
Reflecting there <.> mo </.> their culture <,> their mother tongue
such like that <,> but they want integration of the India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#30:1:B>
<w> They've </w> definitely work for it <w> they've </w> definitely
<,> uh stood in front for their integration of the country our nation <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#31:1:A>
But do you think that the rise of regional parties is a
temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of <{> <[> our politics
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#32:1:B>
<[> <w> It's </w> permanent </[> </{> uh feature

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#33:1:B>
Because nobody can uh <,> uh divert our <-> divert the </->
regional <,> culture or regional languages <,> you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#34:1:B>
So <,> uh this is because this is biggest uh <,> our nation <,>
have many languages and many regions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#35:1:B>
So this is the permanent one

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#36:1:B>
Nobody can uh <,,> uh <w> that's </w> why nobody can uh <,> close
this angle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#37:1:B>
This is the only thing <,> only angle <,> the permanent unity <,>
because whenever the regional parties have developed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#38:1:B>
Then uh <,> the national development no doubt at all <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#39:1:A>
Mr Shekhar you were I believe totally associated with the late
M G R who was a very charismatic leader

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#40:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#41:1:A>
Tell us something more about him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#42:1:B>
M G R <,> is uh uncomparable leader <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#43:1:B>
He has <}> <-> fight </-> <+> fought </+> </}> for the poor people
and <}> <-> <.> down </.> </-> <=> downtrodden </=> </}> peoples <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#44:1:B>
Uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine <,,>
cine or such <O> one word </O> yes because he was a big donor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#45:1:B>
Uh uh even though he was asked this he donated <,> uh uh a huge
amount by his hard work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#46:1:B>
Whatever he earned <,> he donated all the money <,> to the people

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#47:1:B>
And after his death <,> he donated <-> the </-> <,> uh his wealth
to his <,> people

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#48:1:B>
Now-a-days it is said <,> he donated his <,> house and uh <,> our
properties to the poor peoples <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#49:1:B>
Just when you see and that <,> uh our Madam our <indig> Puratchi
</indig> Jayalalitha <,> uhm is true follower or the true leader after M G R

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#50:1:A>
How is she carrying on the legacy of M G R <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#51:1:B>
Yes uh even those in the life life of M G R <,> M G R chose
<,> that only Ms Jayalalitha <,> <w> she'll </w> give the <,> <w> she'll </w>
be the future uh in your leader <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#52:1:B>

After M G R <,> <w> she's </w> the true heir to M G R <,> uh uh to
the party and had a beloved leader <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#54:1:B>
She placed <,> uh now <w> she's </w> the only biggest leader <,>
from Tamil Nadu <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#55:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#56:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#57:1:A>
I mean <,> <w> how's </w> she carrying on <,> what M G R had done ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#58:1:B>
In all political <,,> policies and political activities <,> uh
see even though in <w> M G R's </w> life there is uh like this you see <,>
she was trained and she <,> she <}> <-> was </-> <+> has </+> </}> come
through <,> only by M G R

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#59:1:B>
And M G R choose <,> <w> she'll </w> be the successor for the party

</}> she is doing <,> you see all problems of uh by-elections and all other
things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#61:1:B>
She is always with the poor people just like M G R

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#62:1:B>
<w> She's </w> fighting for the poor people for downtrodden people
<,> uh as in by election manifesto she has declared all things to the favour
and <O> one word </O> but without any <,,> other parties <,> uhm see in the
election manifesto <,> she gave <O> one word </O> sort of manifesto

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#63:1:B>
It is prepared only for the poor people

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#64:1:A>
I can see that <w> you've </w> pinned photograph of Ms
Jayalalitha <,> <{> <[> yes <,> any particular reason for that ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#78:1:A>
<w> You've </w> been naturally involved in students politics also
<,> <{> <[> yes yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#79:1:A>
Uh do you think there has been a criminalisation of students
politics in the country over the years ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#80:1:B>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#81:1:B>
No no no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#82:1:B>
Student activities not a criminal in politics not a criminal
activity <,> because <,> in studies this you know <,> uh in student
activities in our dravidian movement <,> uh in Tamil Nadu <,> like our
Annavar Periyar <,> just like M G R all are in the <,> dravidian movement

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#83:1:B>
That trains the students <,> not only in political activities <,>
they must be after <}> <-> <.> aw </.> </-> <=> awareness </=> </}> of the
political that is our <,> uh political situation in Tamil Nadu

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#84:1:B>
Or as well as in India international <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#85:1:B>
Uh to save their culture and their <,> uh language itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#86:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> a necessary training in political <,> life <w>
that's </w> all <,> <{> <[> yes <,> not a criminalisation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#87:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#88:1:A>
Right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#89:1:A>
Uh what is the specific problem in your constituency in Dharmapuri
<,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#90:1:B>
Dharmapuri you know is in now a days the Cauvery water dispute
is the major problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#91:1:B>
Our Madam also recommended our <?> base </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#92:1:B>
There is our recommended facts to send it to a tribunal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#93:1:B>
Uh now <w> it's </w> a promise going that way <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#94:1:A>
Assuming that this problem is solved amicably <,> how will it
affect your constituency and Tamil Nadu as a whole ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#95:1:B>
I I want to solve this for <-> all </-> welfare of all states

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#96:1:B>
Now Karnataka Maharashtra Pondicherry <,> benifitted

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#97:1:B>
But the Tamil Nadu people those <,> uh are are utilised its water

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#98:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#106:1:B>
<[> That is </[> </{> end of this

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#107:1:B>
But even in my parliamentary constituency <,> even though Cauvery
enters <,> we never got a drop of water for drinking facilities or irrigation
facilities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#108:1:B>
Just as it enters and go to <,> some other areas

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#118:1:B>
Uh state centre relation regarding this <,> uh the state and
centre relations <,> we our our you see our late M G R has told about the
state and centre relationship <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#119:1:B>
Uh state and centre should have equal powers and uh <,> equal <O>
one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#120:1:B>
Our Madam <indig> puratchia </indig> Jayalalitha also about that
is also following that <,> states relations

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#121:1:B>
<w> That's </w> all we wanted

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#122:1:A>
<w> You're </w> in opposition <,> in both your home state as
well as in national politics

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#123:1:A>
How do you reconcile it as a truth

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#124:1:B>
We don't worry about in opposition or ruling <,>

<w> We're </w> always A I D M K led by our <indig> puratchia
</indig> Jayalalitha is fighting for the poor people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#126:1:B>

ruling

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#127:1:B>
<w> We're </w> fighting for the poor people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#128:1:B>
<w> We're </w> uh <,> reflecting or <w> we're </w> uh <,> uhm
showing the poor <w> people's </w> view and angles to the ruling party
whether in a state or centre <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#129:1:B>
<w> That's </w> all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#130:1:A>
One last final question Mr Shekhar <w> you're </w> an
advocate <,> <{1> <[1> yes <,> by profession <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#131:1:A>
So how do you reconcile your role as an advocate and a politician ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#132:1:B>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#133:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#134:1:B>
Yes from the beginning as a student <w> we've </w> say I was
in uh <,> politicians <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#135:1:B>
Uh not yet fully <.> in </.> involved in politics that is
professional made professional <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#136:1:B>
In this way I was in the political activity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#137:1:B>
So there is <-> no </-> nothing more to mention about the that <,>
advocate profession because <w> it's </w> a high profession <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#138:1:B>
Anyhow I got this chance uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#159:2:C>

remember <,> Nehru <,,> Gandhi <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,> and <,> Mrs Gandhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#160:2:C>
And they had <,> they had great respect for our leaders <,> and
also Ravindranath Tagore <,> they always remembered him <,> <{3> <[3> uhm uhm
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#161:2:C>
And also uh as per the <,> political relations <,> they were
always supporting us <,> in the United Nations also <,> usually

visiting India as tourists or were they <,> uh uh were they keen to acquire
<,> knowledge or information about India our country our culture <,,> ?

Also I was enjoying my time <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#171:2:B>
Uh is it <,> uh uh correct presumption that you were <,> the
first <,> uh person from Naga <,> to have served in the Indian Foreign
Service <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#172:2:B>
And to have been an ambassador <,> representing our country <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#173:2:C>
Yes in uh <,> in Nagaland <,,> uh as far as <}> <-> <.> Naga
</.> </-> <=> Nagaland </=> </}> is concerned I was the first one <,> uh
still I am the first one from the Nagaland <,> to join the Indian Foreign
Service

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#174:2:B>
And how many years did you serve <,> there <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#175:2:C>
I think about twenty years

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#176:2:B>
Oh then do you <,> believe now that your years in the Foreign
Service have been rewarding for you <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#177:2:C>
Well it was very interesting <,,> wherever I went I made
friends <,,> and specially for india <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#178:2:C>
And only that uh <,> when I had gone to Brussels <,> <{> <[> ah ha
<,> eh uh Rome <,,> and Washington D C <,> and Shri Lanka <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#179:2:B>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#180:2:B>
I believe Miss Haralu that uh <,> your board <,> has a varied
activities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#181:2:B>
Uh we would like to hear from you <,> about some of your
activities <,> projects <,> initiatives <,> in different <,> areas <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#182:2:C>
You see we have a welfare extension projects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#183:2:C>
And this projects have <,,> this projects have <,> five centres
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#184:2:C>
And <,> you know in Nagaland <w> we've </w> seven districts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#185:2:C>
And in six districts we have got these projects centres <,> and
these are in border areas of Nagaland <,> state

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#186:2:C>
And for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas
<,> so in in those centres we have a <,> maternity and child welfare centres
we have put up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#187:2:C>
And in these centres we have a <indig> dai </indig> <,> and a
<indig> gramsevika </indig> and <O> one word </O> instructor <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#188:2:B>
What are the activities you are engaged <,> on these days
<,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#189:2:C>
Uh we are mainly implementing the schemes <,> of the centre
<,> central social welfare board

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#190:2:C>
And these are <,> uh <-> social uh social </-> social economic
programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#191:2:C>
There are <,> for uh in <,> that programme we extend uh financial
assistance to the <,> some registered societies <,> for piggery which is very
popular <,> and weaving and knitting <,> and dairy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#192:2:C>
And uh <w> we've </w> other programmes like holiday home camps for
children <,> for the tribal <,> from the age of nine to <,> fourteen years

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#193:2:C>
And this is very also very popular <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#194:2:C>
Usually these are conducted in winter <,> and uh <,> the children
are encouraged in this uh <,> in this those are mainly for four children or
four people you know

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#195:2:C>
And then uh <,> the purpose is to give them a chance to <,> uh see
places and also conducting the camps for that to <,> uh to develop <,,>
leadership training like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#196:2:C>
And then uh <,> <w> we've </w> <O> one word </O> course for those
women <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#197:2:C>
This mainly for the women who are the <}> <-> dropped </-> <+>
drop </+> </}> outs <,> uh from schools

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#198:2:C>
Then we give them stipend <,> for years <,> year course or two
years course

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#199:2:C>
Then we have vocational training for <,> women for uh <O> one or
two word </O> of women <,> and this is for to train them in tailoring <,> uh
knitting or even typing and other vocational training so that they will be
able to get <,> a self self-employment or <,> a get some employment also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#200:2:B>
Now tell me <,> uh something about uh <,> uhm the status of
women <,> in uh Nagaland uh particularly uh <,> vis a vis men and your
interface with society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#201:2:B>
And do do you think that <,> uh the Naga women have progressed a
lot ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#202:2:B>
And what are your hopes for the future <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#203:2:C>
I think <-> the </-> when you <,,> uh think of in term of the
literacy rate <,> the female literacy rate is very high <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#204:2:C>
Uh I think one of the highest <,> one of the highest in <,,> think
in india also

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#205:2:C>
And <,> in Nagaland the women are given <,> the girls are given
equal opportunity <,> uh equal <}> <-> <.> appoi </.> </-> <=> appointment
</=> </}> employment <,> and also few of girls have almost reached it <,> if
I consider top

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#206:2:C>
Uh we have a couple of IAS officers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#207:2:C>
And also in addition <,> uh uh all the departments we have
directors like that

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#208:2:C>
But still our rural women are <,> in majority <,> and I must say
that I am glad to say that <,> this <indig> panchayat teer rajasthani
</indig> and I think that they <-> were </-. give  <,> a a real opportunity
to women <,> because a women has <,> two things we have not <,> still
achieved that is <,> inheritance <,> and then women have no place in the <,>
<?> municipality </?> or <,> in the Assembly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#209:2:C>
So I think that the <,> <indig> panchayati raj </indig> will give
them a opportunity to come up in that

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#210:2:C>
Because <,> the <}> <-> <.> deci </.> </-> <=> decision </=> </}>
making is they are not <,> they are not involved in that <,> and I think that
<,> to have a society uh uh <,,> a progressive society <,> or developed
society we need a participation of <.> cipation </.> of the women also <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#211:2:B>
Uh what is your day like <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#212:2:B>
Would you like to tell us <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#213:2:C>
Well first of all <,> to tell you honestly <,> I do begin
with a two cups of tea <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#214:2:C>
And then I start going to the garden because I love gardening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#215:2:C>
Then gardening <,,> uh most of <O> one word </O> is done in the
morning after <,> tea

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#216:2:C>
And then uh <,> I come in and may be I watch TV <,> uh the the
news <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#217:2:C>
And after that may be sometime I cook <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#218:2:C>
Then <,> I rush <,> to get ready to go to the office <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#219:2:C>
And I go to the central welfare board <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#220:2:C>
I mean our <,> our office uh in the town <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#221:2:C>
Then the whole day <w> I'm </w> there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#222:2:C>
But most of the time I also travel <,> uh to all the districts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#223:2:C>
Then in the evening <,> of course no one in the evening I come
back <,> and I read

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#224:2:C>
Or sometime may be I watch <,,> uh TV and sometime I read Holmes
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#225:2:C>
And <,,> then in evening I watch <,> <O> one word </O> after the
news I go to bed

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#226:2:B>
Uh Miss Haralu <,> do you mind if I ask a personal question
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#227:2:B>
Uh I was wondering <,> how come an attractive <- > like </-> <,>
lady like you <,> is still single <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-044#228:2:C>
Uh thank you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#229:2:C>
But you know <w> I'm </w> always <,> uh very interested in career
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#230:2:C>
And I wanted to do so many things <,> and I still want to do so
many things

<ICE-IND:S1B-044#231:2:C>
So <,> I had no time to <O> laugh </O> </I>
