<h> Big changes in industrial policy: Hegde </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#2:1>
<@PR> NEW DELHI {#}, <@DR> Jan. 6 {#}
- - The industrial policy will be changed <quote> " radically,
drastically and substantially" </quote> with special emphasis on
employment generation, poverty alleviation and rural development, the
Planning Commission deputy Chairman, Mr R.K. Hegde, said today, reports <@SR>
UNI {#}. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#3:1>
The changes in the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 and
subsequent Government statements in this regard would be finalized soon
after wide-ranging discussions with captains of industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#4:1>
Briefing reporters on the three-day deliberations of the
whole-time members of the newly-constituted Planning Commission, Mr Hedge
said the draft approach paper on the Eighth Plan ( 1990-<w> ' 95 </w> ) would
be ready by the end of this month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#5:1>
Mr Hegde said the approach paper would be drawn up in accordance
with the policies, programmes and priorities of the new Government and the
ideology of the National Front Government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#6:1>
The commission had worked out a time table for finalizing the
draft approach paper by the end of this month. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#7:1>
Till then the commission would receive the views of various
representative organizations like the Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, since there <quote> " is going to be a radical change" </quote>
in the industrial policy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#8:1>
The consultation with the captains of industry was to ascertain
whether they were prepared to invest in the priority areas set by the new
Government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#9:1>
Mr Hegde said the working of the public sector units, particularly
in the spheres of steel, petro-chemicals, fertilizer and power, would be
reviewed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#10:1>
This exercise would be designed to take <quote> " corrective
action" </quote> and remove weaknesses that had crept into the functioning
of the sector. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#11:1>
Mr Hegde said there was consensus at the three-day meeting on
the need to reduce the number of Centrally-sponsored schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#12:1>
<quote> " We would rather have more and more of <indig> panchayat
</indig> , district and <indig> zilla parishad </indig> - sponsored schemes
than Centrally-sponsored schemes" </quote> , he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#13:1>
How drastically the Centrally-sponsored schemes were to be
reduced would be decided by the end of the month, he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#14:1>
<bold> He said the <indig> Jawahar Rozgar Yojana </indig> and
<indig> Nehru Rozgar Yojana </indig> would be recast, and their names
would be changed with <quote> " good ones" </quote> . </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#15:1>
Mr Hegde said local institutions would have a decisive role in
choosing the kind of employment to be provided to the rural unemployed.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#16:1>
There will be direct funding to <indig> panchayat </indig>
institutions but not from the <quote> " Prime Minister to District
Magistrate" </quote> , he said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#17:1>
The State Governments <quote> " will not be bypassed and we will
function within the federal framework" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#18:1>
The funding of the local bodies would be through the State
Governments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#19:1>
Mr Hegde said after the approach paper was ready, a meeting of
the National Development Council would be called to consider it </p> </I>

SOUTH <w> India's </w> only annual international fair is
growing <quote> 'fairer' </quote> by the year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#24:2>
This <w> year's </w> leather fair in Madras was an impeccable show
indeed - - scores of aesthetically designed cubicles, set in neat rows,
displaying an exhaustive array of goods and machinery.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#25:2>
The presence of a large number of foreigners, both as participants
and visitors, lent the grand event the international dimension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#26:2>
In terms of sheer size, the fifth India International Leather
Fair, in January, was unprecedented.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#27:2>
From a few hundred square meters in 1985 the display area had gone
up to 6,000 sq. meters.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#28:2>
More than a hundred of the 260 exhibitors were from abroad and this
was proof enough that the Madras fair has gained in importance the world
over. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#29:2>
As in the previous years, the Italians with their sophisticated
machinery and upmarket products dominated the fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#30:2>
There were the Germans, the French, the British and the Americans
too, quite a few of them well-known names.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#31:2>
Visitors from 25 countries attended the fair and there were 20
official business delegations from abroad. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#32:2>
A quick survey showed that nearly 15,000 business visitors were
registered on the first three days of the fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#33:2>
New business worth several <indig> crores </indig> of rupees was
struck at the fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#34:2>
Moreover the fair gave an opportunity to Indian exporters to
establish contacts with many foreign buyers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#35:2>
According to K.V. Rajan, chief general manager of Trade Fair
Authority of India, the organisers of the fair, participants of last <w>
year's </w> fair had reported business worth Rs 100 <indig> crore </indig> as
a direct result of the fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#36:2>
<quote> " This year it could be in the region of Rs 200 <indig> crore
</indig> , " </quote> he says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#37:2>
One criticism that has been levelled against the fair right from
its inception is that it is largely import-oriented.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#38:2>
The large turnout of machinery and equipment manufacturers from
abroad with their imposing gadgets has always kept the domestic industry
under their shadow, it is said.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#39:2>
Proponents of this criticism point to the number of import deals
struck at the fair, which are more than the export inquiries, as proof. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#40:2>
Officials of the Trade Fair Authority of India and the Council of
Leather Exports ( CLE) justify that the import slant is <}> <-> prefectly
</-> <+> perfectly </+> </}> in tune with the multi-faceted objective of the
fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#41:2>
M.M. Hashim, chairman of CLE, points out that the Indian leather
industry needs most urgently large-scale modernisation of its existing
production facilities to enable it to compete effectively in the highly
sophisticated international market.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#42:2>
<X> <quote> " Upgrading of technology will enhance the quality of the
products as also cut back on manufacturing costs.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X43:2>
Quality and price are the two significant factors that will
determine <w> India's </w> future in the world market, " </quote> </X> he
feels. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#44:2>
It is true that, despite the <w> country's </w> impressive gains
made on the leather export front in the last few years, its share in the
total global imports has remained at a woefully negligible figure of less
than two per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#45:2>
As per <w> CLE's </w> projections, <w> India's </w> exports should
reach five per cent of world imports by the turn of the century.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#46:2>
Expansion of the production base with a massive dose of modernisation
is the only way to achieve this.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#47:2>
<w> India's </w> exports now stand at Rs 2,000 <indig> crore </indig>
a year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#48:2>
In this context, the fair provides an excellent opportunity for
domestic entrepreneurs to get first-hand knowledge of the advances made in
the leather technology field.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#49:2>
This apart, small-scale manufacturers, who form 75 per cent of the
domestic cartel and who can ill-afford to go abroad, are immensely benefited
by the fair. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#50:2>
A survey of the business inquiries at this <w> year's </w> fair
has revealed that nearly half of the orders made were for exports.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#51:2>
The survey done by TFAI with assistance from NIIT of Delhi shows that
the percentage of exporters among the total business visitors was 37.37
whereas it is only 10.93 for importers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#52:2>
However TFAI has a problem: how to accommodate the growing number
of participants, year after year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#53:2>
Space at Rajaji Hall in Madras is limited.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#54:2>
There was speculation that the fair may be shifted to Delhi from next
year onwards if a larger and permanent site could not be found in Madras.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#55:2>
But the rumours have now been scotched with the Union commerce
ministry announcing that the fair will continue to be held in Madras
considering its importance in the leather map of the country.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#56:2>
Besides, an overwhelmingly large number of participants, both
domestic and overseas, have expressed their preference for the city, with its
informal atmosphere and distinctive cultural ambience, to any other location.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#57:2>
While next <w> year's </w> fair has been tentatively fixed to be held
at Rajaji Hall, TFAI has renewed its efforts to get a larger and permanent
site allocated by the Tamil Nadu government. </p>

East is east and west is west; and never shall the twain meet.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#63:3>
Maybe.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#64:3>
But the Kipling cliche dissolves delightfully in the musical magic of
the master fusionist from Madras, L. Subramaniam.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#65:3>
Appropriately enough, the man who has blended the melody and rhythm
of his native idiom with the harmonic richness of European classical music
was the star of orchestral evening organised by the Indian Centre for
Cultural research in New <w> Delhi's </w> Siri Fort auditorium on East <w>
Germany's </w> republic day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#66:3>
The inspired violinist who has performed with legends like
Yehudi Menuhin, Zubin Mehta, Bismillah Khan and Ravi Shankar would have
been hunching over the sick and writing out prescriptions but for the
advice of the revered Carnatic vocalist Chembai Vaidyanath Bhagavathar.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#67:3>
Chembai told him: <X> <quote> " I have known and sung with five
generations of violinists, but none like you.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X68:3>
What are you going to do with an MBBS degree? Take my word, one day
you would become the king of violin." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#69:3>
He did and became the first Indian violinist to have performed at
the Bolshoi Theatre, the Lincoln Centre, the Royal Albert Hall, and the
Champs Elysees Theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#70:3>
The orchestral piece, <it> Fantasy on Vedic Chants </it> , he
composed when his mother expired has been performed all over the world
including at the famous Tchaikovsky Hall in Moscow by the USSR-TV Radio
Symphony Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Fedoseyov.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#71:3>
<it> The Fantasy, Turbulence </it> and <it> Shantipriya </it> proved
to be instant hits.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#72:3>
Besides, he composed the music for Mira <w> Nair's </w> film <it>
Salam Bombay </it> and was the music <}> <-> adivser </-> <+> adviser </+>
</}> for Peter <w> Brook's </w> stage production <it> Mahabharata </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#73:3>
He has produced about 50 records including a five-volume <it>
Anthology of Indian Music </it> for Radio France. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#74:3>
<w> Subramaniam's </w> <it> Fantasy Without Limits </it> , one of
the first east-west albums released in the US, was selected one of the best
albums of the year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#75:3>
<it> Blossom </it> won the Spring Journal Award in Japan.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#76:3>
Another milestone is <it> Conversations </it> , his album with
veteran violinist Stephane Grappelli which also featured the well-known Joe
Sample. </p>

Subramaniam. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#80:3>
<w> Subramaniam's </w> father Prof. Lakshminarayana, a violin
teacher, wanted to groom him as a vocalist.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#81:3>
Two-year-old <quote> 'Subbu' </quote> would imitate the tunes hummed
by Lakshminarayana.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#82:3>
But <w> Lakshminarayana's </w> dream was shattered when
Subramaniam contracted diphtheria.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#83:3>
However, not losing heart, Lakshminarayana opened his <w> son's </w>
eyes to the world of musical instruments.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#84:3>
First it was the harmonium: by age five Subramaniam took the bow and
at the age of six made his debut. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#85:3>
The family moved to Jaffna, Sri Lanka, when Lakshminarayana got a
job in the Jaffna College, and later to Colombo.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#86:3>
In 1958 when Tamils of Indian origin were being killed, the family
migrated to Madras and settled down in Royapettah.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#87:3>
<quote> " We had to leave all our belongings in Colombo and landed in
Madras with just the clothes we wore," </quote> says Subramaniam.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#88:3>
Lakshminarayana then started a troupe which launched <w>
Subramaniam's </w> career. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#89:3>
Even as a student of Madras Medical College, Subramaniam used to
accompany the leading Carnatic vocalists.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#90:3>
It was then that he came into contact with Chembai.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#91:3>
<X> <quote> " It was Chembai Mama who gave me encouragement to become
a solo violinist.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X92:3>
As he predicted, I have never earned a single rupee by writing a
medical prescription to date," </quote> </X> says Subramaniam. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#93:3>
<X> <quote> " While I was attending the medical course I asked
the university authorities to allow me to pursue a music course at the
same time.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X94:3>
But their rules did not allow me to do so.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X95:3>
Later, after completing MBBS, I approached them again.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#X96:3>
This time they said that I had to undergo the whole process of
college studies and the shortest time they specified to earn a degree in
music was six years." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#97:3>
He then sent an application to the California Institute of Arts
along with a recorded tape of his music.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#98:3>
Meanwhile, a visiting professor from Ithaca College, Inar Holmes
offered him admission to the Ithaca College on condition that he join his
troupe which had performed all over the world.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#99:3>
Concurrently, the California institute offered him admission
straightaway to the MA course.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#100:3>
Subramaniam went to California, completed his two-year MA course
in nine months, headed the department of South Indian Music till 1976, when
he quit <quote> " because I started performing in so many places that it
became difficult for me to do justice to teaching" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-011#101:3>
The westerners in the seventies, believed that the Indian
violin, performed by half-nude men sitting on the floor, was nothing but a
folk instrument.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#102:3>
To them only <indig> tabla </indig> and <indig> sarod </indig> were
Indian classical instruments.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#103:3>
Subramaniam, in an effort to change this attitude, related
Bach and baroque music to Indian music.

<ICE-IND:W2C-011#104:3>
That, now everyone concedes, has broken down the east<?>-</?>west
barrier in violin music. </p>
