SUMMARY

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#4:1>
The levels of free phenols ( total and monohydroxy ) and their
polymerization by peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase varied seasonally, and in
between the nodules and roots of <it> <foreign> Butea monosperma and
Pterocarpus marsupium </foreign> . </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#5:1>
The nodules and roots contained more free phenols during rainy season
and lesser in the winter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#6:1>
Polymerization of phenols was less in the rainy season and was
increased gradually afterwards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#7:1>
Higher levels of total, monohydroxy and polymerized phenols were
recorded in the nodules than the roots of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium
</foreign> </it> and <it> vice versa </it> in those of <it> B. monosperma.
</it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#8:1>
Phenol oxidase of some tissues did not show opposite relations with
phenols throughout the year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#9:1>
The free phenol levels changed parallel to IAA levels and nitrogenase
activity in the nodules.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#10:1>
Leghaemoglobin content of nodules did not change significantly
throughout the year. </p> <&> centered </&>

INTRODUCTION

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#12:1>
The phenolic substances regulate some of the metabolic functions
of plants ( Schneider and Wightman, 1974 ) including root nodules of
leguminous herbs ( Pate, 1958; Vance, 1978 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#13:1>
The monohydroxy phenols ( 2, 4 dichlorophenol) promote, and dihydroxy
and polyphenols ( gossypol, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol etc. ) inhibit IAA
oxidase activity ( Stafford, 1974 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#14:1>
But regulation of phenol metabolism in root nodules and roots of
leguminous trees, and its relation with nitrogenase activity in different
seasons were not studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#15:1>
Besides, most of the studies on phenol metabolism are based on
colorimetric estimation of chromogenic groups which does not reflect the
degree of polymerization of phenols i.e. the availability of free monomers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#16:1>
So, the conclusions drawn based only on colorimetric studies reflects
incomplete idea <O> <&> page </&> 115 </O> on phenol ( Siegel and Enns, 1979 )
and their relations with other metabolic processes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#17:1>
Considering the above limitations, the availability of free
functional groups and the degree of polymerization of phenols were studied
simultaneously in the root nodules and roots of two hetherto unexplored
leguminous trees viz. <it> <foreign> Pterocarpus marsupium </foreign> </it>
<foreign> Roxb. </foreign> and <it> <foreign> Butea monosperma </foreign>
</it> ( Lam. ) Taub. to enlighten the role of phenol metabolism on regulation
of IAA metabolism, nodulation and nitrogen fixation in leguminous trees. </p>

<h> MATERIALS AND METHODS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#19:1>
The nodules and roots of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium and B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> were collected from the plants growing naturally
within the campus of the Burdwan University, West Bengal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#20:1>
Except rainy seaon, the basins of the plants were watered @ 80 1 /
sq.m. on every 4th day during the winter and summer seasons, and on every 6th
day during the post-rainy sseason to maintain a 22 %<*>plus or minus</*>3
moisture level in the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#21:1>
The basin soil was nurtured after 2d of watering and during the dry
spells of the rainy season to loosen the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#22:1>
Under these cultural practices, the nodules of any specific stage
develop into uniform shape and size throughout the year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#23:1>
The nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> were
always spherical and those of <it> <foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it>
became elongated and branched, to a limited extent, at maturity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#24:1>
The nodules of both the plants do not senesce from the base but as a
whole. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#25:1>
The mature nodules were studied for the present communication.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#26:1>
The fresh and finest roots were collected from the nodulated plants,
washed throughly and observed under a microscope ( X20 ) to ascertain
initiation of nodulation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#27:1>
The tips ( 2 mm) of the roots without nodule initials were removed
and next 4-5 cm portions were used for the experiments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#28:1>
Total phenol was estimated spectrophotometrically ( Bray and
Thrope, 1954 ) as ferulic acid equivalents and monohydroxy phenol content (
Emerson, 1943 ) as hydroxybenzonic acid equivalents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#29:1>
The UV absorption spectra of phenols were determined ( Stafford, 1960 )
from portions of total phenol extracts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#30:1>
IAA was extracted ( Sinha and Basu, 1981 ) from fresh nodules and
roots ( 50g ) , chromatographed ( thrice ) with authentic IAA on TLC plates
coated with silicagel G and developed with isopropanol : ammonia : water ( 10
: 1 : 1, by volume ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#31:1>
Chromogenic reagent ( Hamilton <it> et al, </it> 1961 ) was
sprayed along the marker and comparing the pink spot ( R<sb>f</sb> 0.85) of
the marker, developed after spraying, a gel band of R<sb>f</sb> 0.8 - - 0.9
was scrapped off, eluted ( thrice ) in diethyl ether and evaporated in
vacuum. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 116 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#32:1>
Extracted samples were methylated with diazomethane ( Rose and
Bradbeer, 1971 ) and chromatographed in a Pye Unicam GC column ( temp.
190<*>degrees</*>C, 40 ml / min N<sb>2</sb> as carrier gas).

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#33:1>
Samples were quantified comparing the peaks ( retention time 10.6 min )
areas of extracted samples with those of known amount of authentic IAA.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#34:1>
Experimental loss of IAA was calculated by running known amount of
IAA parallelly with extraction of IAA from tissues and final results were
rectified accordingly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#35:1>
Biological activity of the extracted samples were checked ( Basu and
Tuli, 1972 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#36:1>
IAA oxidase was extracted from fresh nodules and roots ( 1g ) and
assyed following the method of ( Sinha and Basu, 1981 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#37:1>
Peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enxymes of roots and nodules ( 200
mg ) were extracted and measured at 420 nm ( Kar and Mishra, 1976 ) in terms
of purpurogallin formation in 2 min.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#38:1>
Protein content of the enzyme extracts were estimated ( Lowry <it> et
al., </it> 1951 ) as bovine serum albumin equivalents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#39:1>
Leghaemoglobin of nodules was extracted ( Vance, 1978 ) from
fresh nodules.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#40:1>
About 200 mg fresh, mature nodules were incubated in a 10 ml vial
capped with a serum septa and incubated for 1-2h with air-acetylene ( 9 : 1 :
: V : V ) mixture and ethylene was estimated comparing the values with those
of the standard curve of ethylene. </p> <&> centered </&>

<h> RESULTS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#42:1>
The total and monohydroxy ( Fig. 1 ) phenol contents were higher
in the nodules than roots of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> but
changed almost parallelly in all the seasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#43:1>
Levels of phenols ( Fig. 1A, B ) were optimum in august ( rainy
season) and minimum in February ( Winter ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#44:1>
The phenols of the nodules and roots of <it> <foreign> B. monosperma
</foreign> </it> followed the trends of changes of those of <it> <foreign> P.
marsupium </foreign> </it> ( Fig. 1A, B ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#45:1>
Unlike <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> , the phenol
contents in the nodules of <it> <foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> were
always lower than those of the roots.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#46:1>
Between the two plants, the nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium
</foreign> </it> possessed more phenols than those of <it> <foreign> B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> ( Fig. 1A, B ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#47:1>
The peroxidase ( Fig. 1C ) and polyphenol oxidase ( Fig. 1D )
enzymes were more active in the roots than the nodules of <it> <foreign> P.
marsupium </foreign> </it> and showed maximum and minimum levels of
activities in summer ( May ) and rainy seasons ( August ) , respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#48:1>
Unlike <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> , </it> the phenol
oxidase of <it> <foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> was more active in
the nodules than the roots and did not follow any common trend of variation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#49:1>
The phenol oxidase of nodules of <it> <foreign> B. monosperma
</foreign> </it> was more active ( Fig. 1C ) in winter ( December / February ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#50:1>
However, peroxidase activity of the roots of <it> <foreign> B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> was more active in post-rainy seasons ( September )
and polyphenol oxidase activity of the roots did not change significantly.
</p> <O> <&> page </&> 117 </O> <O> figure 1. </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#51:1>
The UV difference spectra of the phenols of nodules of <it>
<foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and roots of <it> <foreign> B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> were higher than those of the respective roots
and nodules ( Fig. 2A, B, C, D ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#52:1>
Absorptions at lower UV zone ( 250 nm ) , were higher in the rainy
season ( Fig. 2A ) , and in the following seasons it declined gradually (
Fig. 2B, C, D ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#53:1>
Contrary to these results, the absorptions at higher wavelengths (
300, 350 nm ) were lower in the rainy season and increased gradually
afterwards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#54:1>
Highest degree of polymerization of phenols ( complex polymeric
phenols ) were recorded in the winter ( Fig. 2C ) when absorptions above 350
nm remained almost unchanged. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#55:1>
The IAA levels and IAA oxidase activities changed oppositely in
the nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and <it>
<foreign> B. Monosperma. </foreign> </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#56:1>
The IAA levels were higher and IAA oxidase <O> <&> page </&> 118 </O>
<O> figure 2. </O> <O> caption </O> activities were lower in winter but were
reversed in the rainy season ( Fig. 3A, B ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#57:1>
The roots of the plants had minimum levels of IAA and higher IAA
oxidase activities and the former did not change seasonally.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#58:1>
The nitrogenase activity ( Fig. 4 ) changed parallelly with IAA level
( Fig. 3A ) throughout the year and was comparatively less active in the
nodules of <it> <foreign> B monosperma </foreign> </it> than that of <it>
<foreign> P. marsupium. </foreign> </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#59:1>
Leghaemoglobin contents ( Fig.4) of the nodules did not vary
significantly in different seasons. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#60:1>
DISCUSSION

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#61:1>
During the rainy season ( August ) , lower peroxidase and
polyphenol oxidase ( Fig. 1C & D ) activities in the nodules of <it>
<foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and <it> <foreign> B. monosperma
</foreign> </it> would polymerize lesser phenol units ( Fig. 2A ) resulting
in increase of free total and monohydroxy ( Fig. 1B ) phenols ( Stafford,
1974 ) and more absorption at lower UV ( 250 nm ) zone ( Fig. 1A & B ) (
Siegel and Enns, 1979 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#62:1>
Higher levels of free phenols would provide more di and polyphenols
and inhibit IAA oxidase activity in the <O> <&> page </&> 119 </O> <O> figure
3. </O> <O> caption </O> nodules.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#63:1>
Enhanced levels of IAA, lower IAA oxidase activity ( Fig. 3A & 3B )
in the rainy season and no activity of IAA oxidase of the nodules of the
plants support the view Lower degree of polymerization i.e. more absorption
at 250 nm in the rainy season than the other seasons ( Fig. 2A, B, C, D )
would be due to lowest activities of the phenol oxidases ( Fig. 1C, D ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#64:1>
Following the rainy season, free phenols declined gradually to a
minimum level upto the winter ( December-January ) through the post-rainy
season ( October ) and concomitantly polymerization was increased i.e.
absorption at 250 nm was declined but increased gradually from 350 nm (
Fig. 2B, C ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#65:1>
Corresponding to free and polymerized phenols the phenol oxidases
also increased upto the winter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#66:1>
Free phenols started increasing again from the summer ( March ) , and
the phenol oxidases and polymerization also changed accordingly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#67:1>
Unlike the nodules, regulation of phenol metabolism in the roots is
unclear because the free phenols were not properly related with the
polyphenol oxidase of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and <it>
<foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#68:1>
Such discripancies might be due to indifferent expression of phenol
oxidases <it> in vitro </it> and <it> in vivo </it> conditions ( Stafford,
1974 ) . <O> <&> page </&> 120 </O> <O> figure 4. </O> <O> caption </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#69:1>
Higher phenol levels in the nodules than the roots of <it> <foreign>
P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and <it> vice versa </it> in <it> <foreign> B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> would result from lower polyphenol oxidase in the
respective tissues.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#70:1>
Higher absorptions at 250 nm by the phenols of the nodules of <it>
<foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and roots of <it> <foreign> B.
monosperma </foreign> </it> conform with the observations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#71:1>
Variation in the synthesis of phenols in different tissues by
phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) and tyrosine ammonia lyase ( TAL ) (
Stafford, 1974; Vance, 1978 ) would also cause differences of phenol levels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#72:1>
Higher phenol levels and lower polyphenol oxidase activity in the
nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> than <it> <foreign>
B. monosperma </foreign> </it> implies that polymerized phenols should be
lesser in the former but was higher throughout the year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#73:1>
Probably the <it> <foreign> in situ </foreign> </it> activities of
phenol oxidases have not been expressed exactly after extraction and created
confusion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#74:1>
More synthesis of phenols by PAL and TAL over polymerization in the
nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> than <it> <foreign>
B. monosperma </foreign> </it> would also increase free phenols in the
former.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#75:1>
So, the results reveal that phenol metabolism can not be conjectured
<O> <&> page </&> 121 </O> without simultaneous estimation of the functional
groups, phenol oxidases and polymerization.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#76:1>
It is expected that free phenols should be more in the nodules of the
plants because they possess more IAA, lower oxidase activity than the
respective roots ( Vance, 1978 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#77:1>
But lesser phenol level in the nodules than the roots of <it>
<foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> contradicts the proposition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#78:1>
No change in leghaemoglobin ( LH ) ( Fig. 4 ) along with the
variations in IAA andphenol metabolism, suggest that IAA metabolism imparts
no significant effect on LH content of the nodules.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#79:1>
Proliferation and initiation of nodulation, regulation of primary
growth by IAA ( Dart, 1974, 1977; Vance 1983 ) and monophenols ( Dart, 1974;
Subba Rao, 1977; Garg <it> et al </it> ., 1989 <}> <-> ) </- > <+> ( </+>
</}> and accumulation of IAA ) inhibition of nodulation ) in the mature
nodules; ( Charbonneau and Newcomb, 1985 ) support the idea.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#80:1>
However, the changes of phenols and IAA metabolism in the mature
nodules could be attributed to regulation of their physiological functions
but any such function is expeced to change simultaneously with the IAA
metabolism ( Charbonneau and Newcomb, 1985 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#81:1>
So, parallel changes of nitrogenase activity ( Fig. 4 ) with IAA and
phenols but opposite relations with IAA oxidase and phenol oxidases indicate
that they are interrelated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#82:1>
Unlike nodule initiation, growth and development, more IAA oxidation
and mono phenols reduce while di and polyphenols enhance nitrogenase
activity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#83:1>
So, in the rainy season, nitrogenase activity would be higher ( Fig.
4 ) in the nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and <it>
<foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> because of low IAA oxidase activity
Concomitantly, lower phenol oxidases would result less polymerization and
provide more total free phenols <it> i.e. </it> more di and polyphenols to
limit IAA oxidase activity and facilitate the function of nitrogenase.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#84:1>
Higher IAA also induces LH genes ( Verma and Nadler, 1984 ) and
maintain the LH level and increase nitrogenase activity in the rainy season.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#85:1>
Though monophenols ( inhibitors of nitrogenase ) were also higher in
the nodules in the rainy season ( Fig. 1B ) but their inhibitory effects
would have been superseded by <?> di </?> and polyphenols.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#86:1>
However, both promotive ( Rice and Parenti, 1967; Rice, 1971 ) and
inhibitory ( Blum and Rice, 1969 ) effects of the phenols on the nitrogenase
activity have been reported.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#87:1>
Like the rainy season, in other seasons also, IAA and phenols are
correlated with the nitrogenase activity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#88:1>
IAA also enhances the nitrogenase activity of <it> Nostoc </it> upto
50 <*> mu</*>g / ml but inhibits above 100 <*> mu</*>g / ml ( Chaporkar and
Gangawane, 1984). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-029#89:1>
So, it is evident from the observations that nitrogenase activity
in the mature nodules of <it> <foreign> P. marsupium </foreign> </it> and
<it> <foreign> B. monosperma </foreign> </it> is regulated by IAA and phenol
metabolism. <O> <&> page </&> 122 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#90:1>
Nitrogenase activity changed parallelly with IAA and inversely with
IAA oxidase activity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-029#91:1>
Phenol oxidases regulate free phenol levels and alters nitrogenase
activity through IAA metabolism. </p> <&> centered </&>
