<ICE-IND:W2F-010#6:1>
GREEN was the valley.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#7:1>
Or golden, when the time came.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#8:1>
The lush grasses swayed and danced with the winds that blew, now
mostly sighing, across the land.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#9:1>
The trees too blossomed in floral <foreign> grandeur </foreign> and
fruited heavily every year at the same time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#10:1>
No vagaries.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#11:1>
Nothing was left to chance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#12:1>
The right minerals, the correct fertilizers, the bug poisons: all
schedules perfectly programmed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#13:1>
The microdots seeing, hearing, correcting, doing <*> dotted-line</*>
ruling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#14:1>
All data fed into the unobtrusive monitors, and the schedules
reprogrammed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#15:1>
Year after year.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#16:1>
Season after season.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#17:1>
And the Robos working in unison, precision.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#18:1>
Carrying out commands.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#19:1>
Centuries old.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#20:1>
Beyond the sprawling fields, gleaming monoliths of the cities dotted
the horizon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#21:1>
Here, silent commands traversed miles of delicate circuitry and
produced food for a planet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#22:1>
Guarded it zealously, waiting for the consumers who never came.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#23:1>
And than dumped it into the sea.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#24:1>
Season after season.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#25:1>
Year after year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#26:1>
Over this expansive canvas of bounty streaked a gleaming silver
dot across the azure blue skies one day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#27:1>
From up there, it was a fiesta of colours.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#28:1>
The blue-green of the oceans speckled with the whites of the foaming
waves; the land masses a riot of green and rainbow hues interspersing with
the brown backdrop.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#29:1>
The Vai-gan crew, the ones not occupied with the controls, crowded
around the large monitor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#30:1>
They had not seen a sight like this for a long, long time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#31:1>
A planet with life+ rare enough.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#32:1>
But those rows of green down below signalled intelligence in no
uncertain terms.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#33:1>
Rax-Gii, nearest to the concept of captain in human terms, quickly
thought out the procedures.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#34:1>
The Vai-gans rarely used oral speech for mere communication.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#35:1>
Their vocal cords were delicately nurtured for a special kind of
vocalization somewhat akin to human crooning and an important social
indicator of Vai-gan sophistication.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#36:1>
The ship was quickly enveloped in force screens which rendered it
invincible, invisible and impregnable to any senses, sensors or powers
equivalent or inferior to their own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#37:1>
The Vai-gans were modestly confident that it was rather unlikely that
they would find their superiors in this isolated sector of an obscure and
apparently barren galaxy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#38:1>
They were also philosophical enough to realize that in the event of
really encountering their superiors, the ball ( again, to use human cliches)
would be in the <w> latter's </w> court and there wouldn't be much point in
the precautions anyway. </p> <O> drawing </O> <*> black-square</*> <*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#40:1>
They landed silently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#41:1>
Not really apprehensive, but watchful.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#42:1>
Looking for <quote> ` reception' </quote> parties friendly or
hostile.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#43:1>
Then, not finding any, searching.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#44:1>
In short time it became apparent that something was terribly wrong.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#45:1>
There were no animals to partake the bounty of the munificent plant
life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#46:1>
No sentient beings to watch over diligent robots scurrying about
sowing, reaping and harvesting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#47:1>
They saw the cities and went inside.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#48:1>
No one stopped them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#49:1>
In huge domed cathedrals they found the centralized terminals
whirring and working.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#50:1>
A quick inventory rated them good enough to last another millennium.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#51:1>
Everything was self-correcting,+

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#52:1>
Intelligence of apparently very high order had created this automated
Utopia, providing for all, including unforseen contingencies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#53:1>
But of that intelligence, there seemed to be no organic indication
apparent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#54:1>
No lesser animals even.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#55:1>
It was all very frustrating.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#56:1>
As Tel-Xar, the exo-biologist remarked, they had landed in a deserted
paradise - - an intrinsically incongruous situation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#57:1>
The Vai-gans, however, were known for their inability to leave a
problem unsolved.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#58:1>
Other sentient species in their own galaxy uncharitably dubbed this
as characteristic mule-headedness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#59:1>
The Vai-gans preferred to ignore these as envious diatribes of lesser
beings.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#60:1>
The Vai-ga race had not become masters of space by leaving issues
unresolved.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#61:1>
They had realized early in their evolution the terrific combination
perseverance made with intelligence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#62:1>
With characteristic efficiency they fanned out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#63:1>
Search parties started scouring the cities and the fields.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#64:1>
One unit was assigned to mull over the stuff in local libraries and
museums for any possible leads.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#65:1>
They discovered early that the robots left them strictly alone so
long as they or their controls were not directly interfered with.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#66:1>
Any intransigence, however, was swiftly and efficiently countered
with stun rays which could apparently maim or kill.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#67:1>
The Vai-gans, of course, had the protection of individual force
screens to thwart any such painful consequences.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#68:1>
But it did seem to point to something important, though elusive at
that point in time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#69:1>
It was Niv-San-Ris, the biochemist who first came up with
something plausible.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#70:1>
As was his wont, he announced it in his own inimitable roundabout
style.

At first sight they appeared a+ tattered lot.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#123:1>
The scout team had called the ship as soon as they had sighted them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#124:1>
Rax-Gii had swiftly reached the spot along with his team of
specialists for handling first encounters.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#125:1>
Hidden in clumps of mangroves and rocky dunes, they tried,
literally, to run into the sea as the Vai-gans approached.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#126:1>
No one put up even a token resistance, or made any approach at
communication.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#127:1>
On closer scrutiny, they turned out to be more sorry, miserable,
shaggy and unkempt than the Vai-gans had imagined.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#128:1>
With difficulty, Tel-Xar managed to select and cajole the most
promising specimen of the lot into a dialogue in their own lingo which the
Vai-gans had already mastered from their meticulously preserved tapes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#129:1>
He was a young male.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#130:1>
Phlegmatic, taciturn, but willing to answer in monosyllables.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#131:1>
He didn't have much to add to what they had already conjectured.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#132:1>
It had been the old story of racial decadence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#133:1>
They had reached the zenith of opulence and fallen into indolence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#134:1>
The machines had taken over all the menial tasks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#135:1>
Super-computers and robots had taken over the machines.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#136:1>
The sentient masters languished, wallowing in leisure, pleasures and
perversions.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#137:1>
Life became an unending orgy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#138:1>
The machines had been made well.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#139:1>
The computers designed superbly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#140:1>
They continued to serve silently, efficiently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#141:1>
The orgies continued uninterrupted for centuries.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#142:1>
But the living machines had too many inbuilt potentials for errors.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#143:1>
These surfaced, both in the bipeds and the plants which fed them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#144:1>
The former did realize, albeit dimly, what was going wrong.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#145:1>
But by then, the human race had run out of <quote> ` eggheads'
</quote> to take corrective measures.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#146:1>
So that when the crunch came - - literally - - with the tin
magnifying in the foods, and the diseases, disabilities and deaths, all the
fatted calves could do to avoid the scythe was to vaguely identify the plants
as the source of their misery and run as far away from them as possible.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#147:1>
To the coastline.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#148:1>
Learning to live off the sea, on what the tides brought in, and the
seaweeds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#149:1>
They+ managed to cultivate a few outlandish plants which didn't maim
them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#150:1>
And this was the penultimate tragic scene in the story of these
bipeds on which the Vai-gans had chanced upon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#151:1>
The bipeds had given themselves various names with exalted
connotations in their heyday - - Humanity, Mankind, <foreign> <it> Homo
sapiens </it> </foreign> or Man, the wise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#152:1>
<quote> " Not so wise, in retrospect," </quote> remarked Tel-Xar,

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#153:1>
<quote> " Well, do we leave them like this <*> dotted-line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#155:1>

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#156:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#170:1>
There were more deliberations.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#171:1>
Some arguments.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#172:1>
Technical details of the operation worked out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#173:1>
Rax-Gii and Tel-Xar tried to get the <w> bipeds' </w> reaction or
opinion, but they remained blank and looked away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#174:1>
At last the Vai-gans decided to go ahead with operation cleanup as
they dubbed it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#175:1>
It didn't take them long to destroy the deceptive greenery.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#176:1>
They dumped whatever remained in the+

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#177:1>
The Vai-gan technicians didn't have much difficulty in duping and
successfully shutting off the agricultural computer centres.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#178:1>
The Robos, stopped in their tracks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#179:1>
The computers ceased to hum.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#180:1>
Earth was free of the ubiquitous machines and their perennial
buzzing and whirring.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#181:1>
It was also clear of the poisons they had unwittingly spawned.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#182:1>
The oceans, the long suffering waste bin of the planet, once again
became the receptacle of the filth of the lands, this time on a planetary
scale.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#183:1>
Niv-San-Ris did demur but Rax-Gii overruled him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#184:1>
The Vai-gans were trying to help the dominant life form of the
planet to get on its feet again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#185:1>
The bargain didn't include looking after their waters also. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#186:1>
Rax-Gii flapped his snowy white wings and wagged his scarlet

enthusiastically.

They should gradually take over the land, now that there are no
robos to kill them, or the tin plants to maim them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#X196:1>
In due time, the human race should come back into its own again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#X197:1>
<w> It's </w> a pity they are in a period of transition now, unable
to communicate properly, otherwise they would have shown their gratitude."

With one last look at the nearly scalped planet below, the
Vai-gans left in a blaze of fire and smoke, happy at having done their good
deed for the century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#200:1>
Below, one of the humans - - names had largely been lost or
replaced by guttural nuances in the mists of despair - - watched the round
silver ball of the ship of the alien furry cats with white wings disappear
into the blue void.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#201:1>
He looked with some kindling of interest at the landscape so
strangely bare of the deadly plants, and their guardians.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#202:1>
Perhaps he dimly foresaw a better, freer future for his kind;
moving, maybe even living in those miles and miles of land stretching out
before him and the prospect seemed to be warmly pleasant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#203:1>
A smile perhaps hovered on his lips, but before he could step with
trepidation on the new found bounty, or share the warm glow of this happiness
with his scrumpy group, he froze.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#204:1>
He had heard a loud wailing scream.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#205:1>
Then another.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#206:1>
And another.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#207:1>
Screams, horrendous and hideous, but emanating unmistakably from
human throats.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#208:1>
Dreading unknown demons, he turned.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#209:1>
What he saw curdled his blood and without even realizing it, he too
was screaming mindlessly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#210:1>
The sea had apparently spewed forth the venom deposited in its
entrails for countless centuries.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#211:1>
Or rather, the spawn of that venom gestating in its bosom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#212:1>
Perhaps the latest affront, this time by an alien race, had been the
last straw.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#213:1>
Or perhaps the gestation period had ended and the emergence was
inevitable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#214:1>
Whatever the reason, all along the coastlines, hundreds of slimy,
crunchy, gleaming octopus like creatures but upright and biped, high as the
hills, with huge grinning mouths, six three-metres long tentacled arms and
four-metres long prehensile tails were emerging from the sea.

<ICE-IND:W2F-010#215:1>
From the distance they sensed the humans and the arms raced out
unerringly, picking them up,+  them in one swift motion to the eagerly
waiting mouths, biting off pieces of flesh and bone, chewing and apparently
relishing the morsels, and then greedily seeking out for more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-010#216:1>
The takeover had begun. </p> </I>
