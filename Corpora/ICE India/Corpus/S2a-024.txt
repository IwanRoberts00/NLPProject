<ICE-IND:S2A-024#1:1:A>
What stupid <,> ideas are getting hold of all of us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#2:1:A>
And the teachers have also become trade unionists <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#3:1:A>
They also hold the university <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#4:1:A>
I mean who who is the university ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#5:1:A>
The Vice-chancellor of the university <,,> or the teachers who teach  
they are the university <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#6:1:A>
It is an association <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#7:1:A>
This is my definition <,> university is an association <,> of  
students and teachers in pursuit of scholarship <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#8:1:A>
Scholarship is the only <,,> measure <,> of the performance of the  
university <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#9:1:A>
If you don't have scholarship you are nothing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#10:1:A>
And we want teachers <,> who are great scholars <,> like those  
great <indig> Rishis </indig> of ancient times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#11:1:A>
People who are dedicated who are motivated whose whole purpose is  
<,> the pursuit of knowledge <,> and the application of knowledge to the  
contemporary problems <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#12:1:A>
Now we have to produce such man <,> such power <,> such knowledge  
power <,> in our universities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#13:1:A>
I <,,> am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of John Kenneth  
Galbraith <,> the economist <,> who has pointed out <,> that <,> in the  
feudal times or even the earlier times <,> slave times <,> <-> the </-> <,>  
your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#14:1:A>
I have one thousand slaves at my disposal I am a bigger man <,>  
than another with hundred slaves at his disposal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#15:1:A>
Then came feudalism <,> and they said <,> that a man who has one  
thousand <indig> acres </indig> is <,,> bigger than <,> a man who owns  
hundred <indig> acres </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#16:1:A>
So the land <,,> that was the measure of feudalism <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#17:1:A>
Then came capitalism <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#18:1:A>
If I have one <indig> crore </indig> <,> or I am a millionnaire I  
am bigger than <,> a man who has only some hundreds <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#19:1:A>
Money became the measure <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#20:1:A>
So control over men was the measure at one phase of the history <,>  
over land in the second phase of history <,> over money in the third phase of  
history 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#21:1:A>
Now what is the measure of today <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#22:1:A>
What is the measure of today <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#23:1:A>
The knowledge that you produce <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#24:1:A>
The knowledge that you apply <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#25:1:A>
Knowledge is the measure of performance today <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#26:1:A>
Therefore <,> universities <,,> have to be successive from this  
point of view they have to produce knowledge 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#27:1:A>
Now there is poverty of research in the Indian university <,>  
whether in science <,> natural sciences social sciences 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#28:1:A>
No uh new idea generates <,> no new research has come out <,> no  
new books are <,> prepared <,> some useless text-books are prepared and they  
are the <,> stuff nutrition <,> on which <,> the student community is fed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#29:1:A>
Now with such poor nutrition <,> of third rate text-books <,> I  
mean you ask the students of economics <,> he has not read journals <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#30:1:A>
John Maynard <w> Keynes' </w> general theory of employment interest  
in money <O> one word </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#31:1:A>
Kanes who is that <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#32:1:A>
And what is his book <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#33:1:A>
And why should we read it <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#34:1:A>
Now this is our way of looking at things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#35:1:A>
So <,> uh we need to give great attention to the quality of  
teachers and to the quality of students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#36:1:A>
And the academic staff colleges are intended to produce a better  
quality of teachers 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#37:1:A>
A very good idea <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#38:1:A>
I hope academic staff colleges also do not deteriorate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#39:1:A>
And do not become a ritual <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#40:1:A>
You see <,> there has to be a <,> perennial <,> and continous  
process of renewal <,> to be just what we are <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#41:1:A>
Even a Vice- chancellor will not be of any use unless he renews  
himself constantly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#42:1:A>
By the <O> one word </O> that I have diclosed in the last few  
minutes you would have <,> known by now <,> that I am not such an ignorant  
person about the scene of higher education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#43:1:A>
After all I was not an educationist <,> I was in the Indian  
administration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#44:1:A>
But I have been constantly reading about the <,> scene of higher  
education 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#45:1:A>
In fact I began after the moment I came here I said <quote> where  
is Radhakrishnan Commission ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#46:1:A>
Let me see it first <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#47:1:A>
Where is Kothari Commission <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#48:1:A>
Where are the other <,> what are the other writing ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#49:1:A>
What are the new thoughts <,,> ? </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#50:1:A>
So nobody should take any field <,> without becoming a thorough <,>  
<indig> pandit </indig> in that particular field that is the mark and that is  
the approach of an academic <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#51:1:A>
Even as an administrator I followed the same method <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#52:1:A>
Now I might have been wanting thoroughly <,> but at least that was  
my effort and that was my approach <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#53:1:A>
So <,,> therefore <,> how do we continuously recharge the batteries  
of our teachers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#54:1:A>
Now this is a recharging battery academic staff college <,> is a  
battery recharging process <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#55:1:A>
So that when you go <,> you are <,> brightened refreshed <,> you  
are a new person <,> and your personality changes and the students must say  
<,> is this the same teacher who has come back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#56:1:A>
Some thing has gone wrong but you know you become different teacher  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#57:1:A>
This is what should happen <,> after you go back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#58:1:A>
You must be full of new ideas full of new energies <,,> full of new  
approaches <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#59:1:A>
You must electrify the atmosphere when you go back 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#60:1:A>
This is <,> this is the mark of success of a programme like I hope  
it will happen here also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#61:1:A>
You must go and electrify <,> the atmosphere when you go back <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#62:1:A>
The movement you go back <,> the brightness must spread <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#63:1:A>
So will this happen <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#64:1:A>
You see <,> there are <,,> even in modern times we believe <,> that  
in addition to self-teaching <,> or teaching on the job yourself <,> there is  
an institution of process involved <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#65:1:A>
I belong to the great Indian administrative service <,> which is  
the <,> successor to a greater what people call a greater service for <,> the  
Indian civil service <,> of the colonial times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#66:1:A>
Now in those days there was no training <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#67:1:A>
The I C S did not believe in this kind of formal our institutional  
training <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#68:1:A>
They believed in training on the job <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#69:1:A>
The senior man trains the <,> junior fellow <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#70:1:A>
And in those days <,> the links betweeen the senior and the junior  
<,> were more personal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#71:1:A>
Yes there is also something in that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#72:1:A>
But there is also more <,,> in the process of institutionalization  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#73:1:A>
And it is only after <}> <-> <.> in </.> </-> <=> independence </=>  
</}> <,> that <,> a number of institutions of training <,> of civil servants  
came into existence 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#74:1:A>
It became a big business <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#75:1:A>
And that is how in my career I headed <,> no less than <,> four <,>  
institutions <,> of research and training connected with one part or the  
other <,> of our administrative system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#76:1:A>
Uh <,> Rajiv Gandhi was a great believer <,> and the first question  
he asked was <,> whether chief secretary <,> of the states <,> and the join  
secretary at the centre or even the secretaries and ministers <,> whether  
they were getting any training <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#77:1:A>
This is the question Rajiv Gandhi asked <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#78:1:A>
It was part of his modernism <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#79:1:A>
And as a result of that <,> for the first time for the big bossess  
<,> who consider themselves beyond all training <,,> ministers are beyond all  
training they don't need anything <,> they know everything <,> and the <&> in  
Hindi </&> I A S fellow knows everything <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#80:1:A>
Now that theory is no longer considered to be valid <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#81:1:A>
And <,> <-> he </-> definitely the credit of starting <,> such  
programme for higher civil servants and ministers <,> goes <,> to Rajiv  
Gandhi <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#82:1:A>
Though I must say <,> in the earlier days of S K Dey <,,> where I  
was also the director we use to get <,> senior civil servants as well as even  
ministers in those days <w> MLA's </w> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#83:1:A>
But in recent times <,> in the whole gamut of public administration  
this was started <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#84:1:A>
Now <,> the U G C has started it on the academic side the same who  
is <?> good </?> <,> you cannot be standard 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#85:1:A>
Now our teachers are notorious <,> for using the same notes <,> for  
the whole <,> of the teaching career <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#86:1:A>
What was given by Dhananjayrao Gadgil when I passed my M A <,> same  
notes I go on using <,> for twenty-five years <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#87:1:A>
Now <,,> the fact of the matter is <,> such is the dynamism of  
knowledge <,> the explosion of knowledge <,> what that what you said  
yesterday does not hold good today <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#88:1:A>
A syllabus came in economics <,,> and it said the socialistic  
economic system <,> experience of Russia and East European countries 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#89:1:A>
Now where is socialism ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#90:1:A>
What kind of socialism are you talking of <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#91:1:A>
Things change so rapidly <,> not only <,,> in the realm of  
knowledge but also in the external world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#92:1:A>
And the objectives of programme such as this is <,> to constantly  
<,> bring you up today <,,> both in your subject matter <,> because we have  
subject matter programmes <,> in respect of methodology which is also  
important <,> methodology of teaching <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#93:1:A>
And thirdly the general environment in which you work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#94:1:A>
University is considered to be an Ivory tower 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#95:1:A>
Yes to an extent it is an Ivory tower <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#96:1:A>
But this Ivory tower of education <,> is not <,,> unconnected with  
the <,> economic environment social environment <,,> political environment  
technological environment cultural environment in which we carry on our whole  
process of education <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#97:1:A>
And therefore we ought to know this environment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#98:1:A>
We cannot be frogs in the well <,> dealing only with a commerce  
accountancy and the like 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#99:1:A>
I mean <,> you have to know the whole frame-work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#100:1:A>
And therefore this general programme of orientation <,,> which  
will tell you <,> about the changing <,> environment in politics <,>  
economics <,> in society in technology <,> in culture <,> within India and  
without India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#101:1:A>
I therefore hope that uh <,,> such a programme <,> will not be  
considered by you an irrelevant <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#102:1:A>
What is this programme it is not in the syllabus of Botany <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#103:1:A>
This is not a question to be asked here <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#104:1:A>
We are not here concern with Botany or Zoology or Economics or  
Commerce or Political Science or Education or Hindi or English in pursuing  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#105:1:A>
We are concerned with these <,,> wider frame-work <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#106:1:A>
And I hope that uh <,> you will understand the importance of these  
wider frame-work <,,> that you will interact I mean <,> in all this <,> it is  
not <,> the traditional process where the teacher knows everything <,> and  
the student <,> now it has become reverse 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#107:1:A>
The student feels that he knows everything <,> and the teacher  
knows nothing <,> and he talks some nonsense and we have to tolerate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#108:1:A>
This is the new approach <,> to education that seems to be  
evolving in our country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#109:1:A>
A student in Goa university got ten marks and he failed <,> and he  
promptly writes me ten letters saying that the teachers don't know <,,> uh  
how to <,> uh evaluate <,> and they have wrongly put me at ten and it is a  
great injustice to me <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#110:1:A>
Now what do you do <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#111:1:A>
Therefore <,> we have to create <,> the institutional <,> approach  
<,> for the enhancement and the upgradation of the capability of our teachers 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#112:1:A>
But much will depend on the teachers themselves 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#113:1:A>
How you participate <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#114:1:A>
What you get of the programme will depend <,> will depend on <,>  
how you <,> what effort you made to get out the programme <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#115:1:A>
If you come out <,,> if you <,> bring up your ideas <,> and your  
experience <,> and to share it with others <,> you will find that apart from  
the expert <w> who'll </w> be giving you lectures <,> you will benefit more  
by <,> your interaction with each other <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#116:1:A>
This will be your transformation <,> from a teacher you will  
become a student <,> from an older person you will suddenly become a young  
person <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#117:1:A>
This transformation I hope the programme will bring about <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#118:1:A>
It <,> a programme like this makes you younger <,> it reduces your  
age <,> straight by twenty years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#119:1:A>
So if you are forty <,> your age becomes twenty <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#120:1:A>
And that happens for a teacher also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#121:1:A>
The teacher should not go on uh <,> blabbering in an old way <,>  
but uh <,> he must come out with all the energy of new knowledge and new  
curiosity <,> and the pleasure <,> that is there between communication <,>  
between human beings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#122:1:A>
Communication between human beings is a very big process <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#123:1:A>
It changes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#124:1:A>
It is not communication of one <,> from one to one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#125:1:A>
One becomes hundred in the process of communication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#126:1:A>
So I hope all these processes <,> will take place <,> and as a  
result of uh this programme <,> you will go happier <,> uh more uh delighted  
refreshed <,> committed <,> and uh <,,> you will then go back <,,> and would  
not keep what you have taken to yourselves <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#127:1:A>
But would share it <,> with your fellow teachers <,,> with your  
colleagues <,> with your students <,> and with the academic community of  
which you are a part <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#128:1:A>
So in all this uh <,> process of education and its dessimination  
<,> I wish you all <,> very well <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#129:1:A>
I don't know whether what I have said amounts to any key note  
address <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#130:1:A>
I had not uh prepared myself formally to deliever it <,> but uh  
<,> I share what I felt on the occasion with you all <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#131:1:A>
Once again <,> I must uh give my <,> heartful thanks <,> to the  
Vice-chancellor <,> for uh <,,> allowing us to come here <,> and provide the  
forum for the conduct of the activities <,> of the academic staff college <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#132:1:A>
And I am grateful <,> to <,,> Dr Devasthali for <,,> providing the  
co-ordination <,> at the level here <,,> in this university <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#133:1:A>
I thank them heartly on behalf of Goa university <,> and on behalf  
of myself <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#134:1:A>
And I wish well <,> to you <,> to the participants in the  
programme and to the programme itself 

<ICE-IND:S2A-024#135:1:A>
Thank you very much <,,> </I>
