<ICE-IND:W2A-014#3:1>
<bold> During the eighties, much efforts were made to raise tax
revenue on the one hand and on the other to promote savings in the private
sector, particularly in the household sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#4:1>
Did the efforts produce the intended results ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#5:1>
The author probes into this question by analysing the data for the
eight-year period ( 1980-81 to 1987-88 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#6:1>
The broad conclusion of the study is that taxation structure had been
favourable during the period for promoting savings, and therefore, it needs
to be maintained and improved further so that more savings are generated
to meet our growing developmental needs. </bold> </&> <*> line from left to

<bold> <smallcaps> ONE </smallcaps> </bold> of the major objectives
of tax policy in a developing economy is to mobilise resources for
balanced development of both public and private sectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#8:1>
Tax policy through its composition, incentives and some coercive
measures affects private savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#9:1>
While promoting savings in the private sector, it also channelises the
investible funds into preferred / desired directions. </p> <O> <&>
tantalizer 1 </&> </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#10:1>
In India, tax policy relating to direct taxes ( income-tax,
wealth-tax etc. ) primarily aims at reducing disparities of income and
wealth distribution, curbing conspicuous consumption among people in
higher <O> <&> tantalizer 2 </&> </O> income brackets and channelising the
savings in specific directions by offering incentives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#11:1>
Indirect taxes are intended to collect more revenues, and curb
consumption and expenditure ( both luxury and nonluxury items ) in the
private sector, thus making people spend thrift, thereby promoting savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#12:1>
Thus our tax system through its <quote> ` income effect' </quote>
reduces disposable income, and thereby the capacity to save; and through
incentives it promotes savings in the private sector ( <quote> `
substitution effect' </quote> ) , particularly of the tax payers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#13:1>
Private savings in our country constitutes savings generated by
the household sector and private corporate sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#14:1>
Table 1 shows that the <O> <&> tantalizer 3 </&> </O> <O> Table 1
</O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 723 </O> household sector contributes
over 75 % of the Gross Domestic Savings ( GDS ) in our country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#15:1>
This sector also bears the major share of our tax burden ( both
direct and indirect ) which affects its savings potential adversely.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#16:1>
During the eighties efforts were made to raise tax revenue on the
one hand and on the other to provide incentives for the promotion of
savings in the private sector, particularly the household sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#17:1>
The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of these efforts
on the savings in the household sector in India during 1980-81 to I987-88.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#18:1>
<h> <bold> Incentive Measures </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#19:1>
The Government initiated a number of steps through tax policy to
augment savings in the household sector in our country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#20:1>
Some specific measures taken in this direction during our
reference period are narrated below. </p> <O> <&> tantalizer 4 </&> </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#21:1>
<h> <it> Adjustments in Tax Rates </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#22:1>
The rates of both direct and indirect taxes were adjusted from
time to time to meet the objectives such are revenue collection, curbing
consumption expenditure and increasing saving capacity of the tax payers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#23:1>
Rates of income-tax and wealth-tax were revised downward so as to
create a climate of reasonable tax rate structure, thereby to ensure
better compliance by assessees to tax laws and also enhance their saving
capacity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#24:1>
The rates of income-tax were brought down from the highest marginal
rate of 60 % ( 72 % with surcharge ) on income over Rs. 1 <indig> lakh
</indig> in assessment year 1981-82 to 50 % in the assessment year
1986-87.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#25:1>
The wealth-tax rates were brought down to the maximum of 2 %
during the same period. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#26:1>
<h> <it> Exemption Limit </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#27:1>
The general exemption limit under income tax law was gradually
enhanced from Rs. 12<+>,</+>000 in assessment year 1981-82 to Rs.
15,000, Rs. 18,OOO in assessment years 1982-83 and 1986-87 respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#28:1>
It was further raised to Rs. 22,000 for assessment year 1991-92.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#29:1>
The wealth-tax exemption limit was raised to <O> <&> tantalizer 5
</&> </O> Rs. 2.5 <indig> lakhs </indig> with effect from Assessment year
1986-87 and that of gift-tax to Rs. 20,000 from assessment year 1987-88.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#30:1>
<h> <it> Incentive Provisions under Direct Tax Laws </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#31:1>
( 1) Tax concession on savings and income on such savings (
mostly financial assets under Sections 80 C and 80 ( L) were liberalised
from time to time in terms of both their scope and deduction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#32:1>
The monetary ceilings were also raised.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#33:1>
The investments in National Savings Certificates <roman> 6
</roman> and <roman> 7 </roman> issues ( discontinued from assessment year
1990-91 ) , National Deposits Scheme, etc. were considered for tax concession
purposes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#34:1>
The tax coneessions had considerably enhanced the post-tax rate
of return on such investments. </p>

<p> ( 2)

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#35:1>
Tax concessions with respect to investments in specified shares under
Section 80 ( CC ) was liberalised by raising monetary ceiling to Rs. 20,000.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#36:1>
( Note : <it> <mention> The Finance Act </mention> </it> , 1990
has made a change in the matter of tax concessions under Seetions 80 ( C )
and 80 ( CC ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#37:1>
The present scheme of deduction under these sections has been
replaced by the rebate under Sections 88 and 88 A, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#38:1>
The tax rebate is granted @ 20 % of such investments subject to
monetary ceilings prescribed under the Act. )

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#39:1>
<mention> Capital gains tax </mention> provisions were relaxed
and exemptions granted in certain cases if such gains were invested in
residential house and / or in some notified financial instruments ( assets )
etc. [ Sections 48, 54, 54 E, etc. ] </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#40:1>
( 4) Tax concessions were extended to non-resident Indians
on their investments in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#41:1>
Higher rate of interest on deposits made by them in approved
institutions was permitted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#42:1>
( 5) Depreciation provisions and investment allowances etc. were
rationlised to promote replacements and renewals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#43:1>
( 6) Funding Scheme of <mention> IDBI </mention> was introduced
and tax concessions granted on it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#44:1>
( 7) Public Sector Bonds ( in some cases ) with tax-free interest
were permitted to be floated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#45:1>
The investments in such bonds were also granted wealth-tax exemption.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#46:1>
( 8) Mutual Fund Schemes by public sector financial
institutions like <mention> UTI </mention> , <mention> LIC </mention> and
some nationalised banks were introduced.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#47:1>
They were granted tax concessions under Sections 80 ( CC ) and 80
( L ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#48:1>
[ Section 80 ( CC ) has been replaced by Section 88 ( A ) by
Finance Act l990. ] </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#49:1>
<h> <it> Coercive Measures </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#50:1>
Coercive measures like compulsory Deposit Scheme ( 1974 )
remained in operation till March 31, 1985 with interest and tax benefits.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#51:1>
Some other measures of imporance are :

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#52:1>
( a) overall increase in the interest rates on term deposits,
provident fund contributions, debentures, public deposits with corporate
bodies etc.;

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#53:1>
( b) Issue of ( i) Capital Investnent Bonds and ( ii) Social
Security Certificates by the Government for specific purposes etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#54:1>
These measures also had helped in augmenting savings. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#55:1>
<h> <bold> Impact of Incentives on Taxation </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#56:1>
After a brief account of some of the tax incentive provisions
under our tax laws, we shall now see how taxation ( with such incentives )
affected the household savings during the period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#57:1>
As has been mentioned earlier taxes affect the household savings
through their influence on both the aspects of savings i.e. capacity to <O>
<&> page </&> 724 </O> save and incentive to save.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#58:1>
The <quote> ` income effect' </quote> of taxes reduces the personal
income and thereby the capacity to save ( as saving is a function of
income ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#59:1>
Taxes through their <quote> ` redistributive effect' </quote> also
affect the capacity to save.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#60:1>
If the redistribution of income after taxes is in favour of poor
people, the saving rate is likely to be adversely affected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#61:1>
It is based on the premise that poor people have higher propensity to
consume and therefore they will either be not saving at all or saving at a
very low rate compared to wealthy people.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#62:1>
Taxation affects incentive to save ( substitution of
consumption by saving - - <quote> ` substitution effect' </quote> ) through
its effect on rate of return on the amount saved and invested.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#63:1>
If the post-tax rate of return is attractive, households ( tax
payers ) will be prompted to save ( leaving apart other considerations
like liquidity, pledgeability, contractual saving obligations, etc. )

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#64:1>
The various incentive provisions <O> Table 2 & 3 </O> <O> captions </O>
in tax laws relating to promotion of savings also channelise
such savings in the desired directions ( diversion effect ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#65:1>
The type of tax ( direct or indirect ) and the rate structure of
taxation ( progressive, regressive or proportional ) , also have some
bearing on household savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#66:1>
It should be noted that taxation is only one of the factors affecting
savings in the household sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#67:1>
There are a number of other socio-economic factors which influence
savings such as level of income, rate of interest, inflation, distribution of
national income, old age requirements, social and family obligations,
social status, education level and habits. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#68:1>
The <w> households' </w> capacity to save is affected by tax
burden.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#69:1>
If it is assumed that all indirect taxes<sp>1</sp> are ultimately
borne by the households in our country; and the total non-corporate taxes
( direct and indirect ) which households bear have increased constantly in
terms of both absolute figures and in percentage points to personal income (
refer Tables 2 and 3 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#70:1>
Thus the personal income ( capacity to save) is supposed to have
reduced by the amount of taxes so paid or borne by the households. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#71:1>
Since the rate of savings of the household sector during the
reference period shows erratic fluctuations i.e. between 16.25 % and
19.46 % of personal income <sp> 5</sp> ( Table 2 ) , the marginal saving
rate<sp>3</sp> which works <O> table 4 </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page
</&> 725 </O> out to 20.29 % is considered a better measure / indicator to
know the effect of tax burden on potential savings in the household
sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#72:1>
Thus, if taxes are paid, potential savings in this sector will be
reduced by 20.29 % of the taxes so paid.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#73:1>
It is assumed here that taxes are paid at the cost of both
consumption and savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#74:1>
But, if it is considered that taxes paid do not affect consumption
and are paid out of savings by the tax payers, then the whole of the amount
paid by way of taxes could have been saved by them in the absence of
taxation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#75:1>
While considering the reduction in the <w> households' </w>
capacity to save as a result of tax payments, we should not ignore the
circular flow of tax revenue i.e. back-flow of tax revenue <O> table 5 & 6 </O>
<O> captions </O> in the form of the Government expenditures on
education, health care, social welfare, subsidies etc. for the benefit of the
households. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#76:1>
These benefits / facilities either form part of the income or
some expenditures to be incurred otherwise by the households.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#77:1>
Due to such circular flow of taxes the net decrease in the saving
capacity of this sector will be less.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#78:1>
Since the quantification of the services / facilities provide
by the Govemment is difficult the measurement of net decrease in the saving
capacity of the households ( i.e. total taxes borne minus taxes flown fack )
is equally difficult. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-014#79:1>
The redistributive effects of taxes ( particularly progressive
income and wealth taxes ) on savings depend upon the transformation of income
and wealth from rich to poor or vice versa.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#80:1>
If the redistribution is in favour of the poor ( which is expected
of a good tax system) it reduces the disparities of income and wealth
distribution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#81:1>
Such transformation of income and wealth is supposed to affect
savings adversely because of the high propensity of the poor people to
consume.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#82:1>
If the redistribution favours the rich, the saving is expected to
increase as their marginal saving rate is supposed to be higher.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#83:1>
However, in India, the following facts ( Refer Tables 1 to 4 )
substantiate that the redistributive effects of taxation on inequalities
have been almost nil or insignificant <sp> 4</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#84:1>
( a) increasing dominance of indirect taxes ( i.e. from 82.4 % of
total tax revenue in 1980-81 to 86.4 % in 1987-88 ) ; ( b) low and declining
share of direct taxes borne / paid by households ( i.e. from 10.81 % of total
tax revenue to 7.67 % during the reference period) ; ( c) various tax
concessions for specified savings and reduction in direct tax rates (
income and wealth taxes ) of higher income brackets; ( d) increasing share
of financial assets ( savings ) in gross household savings i.e. from 39.37 %
in 1980-81 to 51.24 % in 1987-88; ( e) increasing share of gross household
savings in gross domestic savings; ( f) the stable average Gini-Lorenz
Ratio after <mention> Third Plan </mention> and upto <mention> Sixth Plan
</mention> i.e. about 0.30 of rural and 0.33 % of urban sectors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-014#85:1>
Thus, accumulation of wealth is rather favoured which is conducive
<O> <&> page </&> 726 </O> to the saving climate in the household sector.
