<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#1:1:A>
So today we <,,> do a lesson <,> about Mahatma Gandhi <,,> who
was <,> a humanitarian <,,> okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#2:1:A>
Mahatma Gandhi the <mention> Father of the Nation </mention> <,> was
the first <,> great leader <,> who not only fired the consciousness of the
masses <,> for independence <,> but also boldly let the struggle for freedom
against the British in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#3:1:A>
And we know that <,> Mahatma <w> Gandhi's </w> weapon <,> for
freedom was <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa </indig> </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#4:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#5:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#6:1:A>
He provided a moral foundation to Indian politics <,> and laid great
stress <,> on the spirit of fearlessness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#7:1:A>
His autobiography <,> <mention> The story of my experiment with
truth </mention> is a classic of our time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#8:1:A>
So he <-> book <,> he </-> wrote many books <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#9:1:A>
One of them was <mention> The story of my experiment with <,> truth
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#10:1:A>
And the chapter which we are doing today is from <,> the last
chapter of this <,> autobiography of his <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#11:1:A>
In this extract we see the firm faith of Mahatma Gandhi <,> in
truth and <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#12:1:A>
To realise them <,> one must have self-purification in mind <,>
word and deed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#13:1:A>
The style is simple and direct <,> and sets the readers thinking
<,,> <&> noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#14:1:A>
It is not without a range that I have to take leave of the reader
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#15:1:A>
And why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#16:1:C>
Because it is the last chapter

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#17:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#18:1:A>
Don't answer chorus <,> because it is the <,> <{> <[> last <,> last
chapter <,> of his <,> autobiography <,> okay

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#19:1:S>
<[> Last </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#20:1:A>
So he says that it causes great <,> pain to him that he is
taking leave of the <,> reader <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#21:1:A>
I had set a high value on my experiment <,> and I do not know
whether <w> I've </w> been able to do justice to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#22:1:A>
I can only say that I have spared <,> no pains to give a faithful
narrative <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#23:1:A>
So he says <,> that <,,> he has <,> I have set high value to my
experiment <,> he has attached <,> <{> <[> great importance </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#24:1:C>
<[> Great importance </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#25:1:A>
He has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with <,>
<{> <[> truth </[> <,,> okay

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#26:1:C>
<[> Truth </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#27:1:A>
And <,,> he is not sure <,> whether he is able to do <{> <[>
justice to </[> those experiments with <,> truth <,> okay <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#28:1:S>
<[> Justice to </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#29:1:A>
Treat them with <,,> fullness and <,> clarity <,,> justice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#30:1:A>
To treat them with fullness and <,> clarity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#31:1:A>
So that every one who reads the book <,> will understand what he is
<,> writing about <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#32:1:A>
I can say that I have spared no pains <,> to give a faithful
narrative <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#33:1:A>
That <w> he's </w> <,> done all that he can <,> do <,,> to give <,>
the account of truth that appeared to <,> him in the right way as it appeared
to him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#34:1:A>
To describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner
in which I have arrived at <,> has been his ceaseless <,> effort <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#35:1:A>
So what has been a ceaseless effort ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#36:1:C>
To speak out the truth <,> and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#37:1:A>
Come on yes <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#38:1:S>
To describe truth as <,> as it has appeared to him and in the
exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#39:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#40:1:A>
So his ceaseless effort was <,> to <.> ar </.> <,> to describe
truth <,,> as it appeared to him and in which way he arrived at <,> truth
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#41:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#42:1:A>
This exercise has given me inaffable mental peace <,> because it
has been my fond hope <,> that it might bring faith <,> in truth and <indig>
ahimsa </indig> to the waverers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#43:1:A>
And he says <,> this exercise <,> of <,,> reproducing truth as he
<,,> felt about it as he arrived <,,> at truth has given him <,> inaffable
mental peace <,> undescribable <,> mental peace <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#44:1:A>
And why does he say <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#45:1:A>
He says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has
always cherished <,,> he has always hope <,> that those who work against
<indig> ahimsa </indig> <,> would follow the path of <indig> ahimsa </indig>
once they read the <,,> book <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#46:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#47:1:A>
So it has <,> it was always his <,,> <-> desire his </-> cherished
desire <,> that <,,> what was his cherished desire ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#48:1:A>
Yes ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#49:1:S>
After reading the book <,> uh or a <{> <[> everything which is
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#50:1:A>
<[> The one who were </[> </{>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#51:1:S>
The one who were waverers <,> and they don't know about truth
and <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> that uh <,>
it might bring the waverers uh to that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#52:1:A>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#53:1:A>
In the principle of <,> <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#54:1:A>
Those who were doubtful about <,> the principle of <indig> ahimsa
</indig> will start following <,> it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#55:1:A>
My uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god <,>
than truth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#56:1:A>
So he says <,> that there is only one god and that is <,> <{> <[>
truth </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#57:1:C>
<[> Truth </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#58:1:A>
And he does not vary in that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#59:1:A>
Okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is
<,> <{> <[> truth </[> <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#60:1:S>
<[> Truth </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#61:1:A>
And if every page of this chapter <,> does not proclaim to the
reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is <indig> ahimsa
</indig> I shall deem <,> all my labour in writing these chapters to have
been in <,> vain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#62:1:A>
So he says that <,> first of all <,> he is convinced <,> that there
is only one god and that is <{> <[> truth </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#63:1:C>
<[> Truth </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#64:1:A>
And another thing he says that <,> in every chapter of the
book <,,> which book please ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#65:1:C>
My experiment with truth

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#66:1:A>
His experiment <,> with truth

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#67:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#68:1:A>
In every chapter of his book <,> he has tried to explain <,> that
if you want <,> to <,> realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of
truth <,> you have to follow the path of <,> <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa </indig>
</[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#69:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#70:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#71:1:A>
I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been <,>
in vain

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#72:1:A>
And he says <,> that in every chapter he has tried to explain <,>
that the only means of realisation of truth is <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa
</indig> </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#73:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#74:1:A>
And if <,> people do not understand it <,> then his writing
<,> that book <,,> and explaining about the principle of <,> <indig> ahimsa
</indig> is all <{> <[> in vain </[> <,> is futile is useless <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#75:1:C>
<[> In vain </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#76:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#77:1:A>
So what is <w> Gandhiji's </w> uniform experience convince him <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#78:1:S>
<w> Gandhiji's </w> uniform experience convinced him that
there is only one god and that is truth

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#79:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#80:1:A>
And how uh <,> what does he say <,> that the only means to realise
truth is what ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#81:1:C>
<indig> Ahimsa </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#82:1:A>
<indig> Ahimsa </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#83:1:A>
The only means to realise truth is <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa </indig>
</[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#84:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#85:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#86:1:A>
And even though <,> my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless
let the <}> <-> leader <.> re </.> </- > <=> readers </=> </}> know <,> that
the vehicle and not the great principle is at <,> fault <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#87:1:A>
So he says that <}> <-> I </-> <=> he </=> </}> wants to make
himself very clear <,> that even after reading the chapters of the book if
people still have doubt about the great principle of <,> <indig> ahimsa
</indig> then they are wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#88:1:A>
It is he who is writing the book <,> may be he is not very clear in
his writing and that is why people have the doubt about <indig> ahimsa
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#89:1:A>
So he that is <,,> the vehicle he himself who is writing the book
<,> he himself is wrong <,> somewhere and not the principle of <{> <[>
<indig> ahimsa </indig> </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#90:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#91:1:A>
After all <,> however sincere my strivings after <indig>
ahimsa </indig> may <+> have </+> been they have been <,> imperfect and <,>
inadequate

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#92:1:A>
And why he says may be he is wrong <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#93:1:A>
Why does he say that may be he is not <,> exactly correct in
explaining <,> about <indig> ahimsa </indig> and writing about <indig> ahimsa
</indig> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#94:1:A>
Yes ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#95:1:S>
Because his principle of <indig> ahimsa </indig> is very <,>
uh <?> complex </?> and it can not be described in uh simple words

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#96:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#97:1:A>
It is very difficult to describe <,> such a great principle as <,>
<indig> ahimsa </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#98:1:A>
And he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully <,,> the
full of <indig> ahimsa </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#99:1:A>
Everything of <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#100:1:A>
So he said he has tried his <,,> level best <,> to describe <,>
<indig> ahimsa </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#101:1:A>
The fleeting glimpses therefore <,> that <w> I've </w> been able
to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of
truth <,> a million times more intense than that of the sun <,> we daily see
with our <,> eyes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#102:1:A>
And what does he say <,> that <,> he only has <,,> fleeting
glimpses that is <,> vanishing views <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#103:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#104:1:A>
Something which passes off <,> within a minute

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#105:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#106:1:A>
And he says that <,,> it is <,,> very difficult to explain <,>
truth <,> whose radiance <,,> is <,,> million times more than that of the <,>
<{> <[> sun </[> <,> okay <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#107:1:C>
<[> Sun </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#108:1:A>
So the brightness of <,,> truth is much more than the
brightness of the <{> <[> sun </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#109:1:C>
<[> Sun </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#110:1:A>
In fact what I have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer
of the mighty <,> efflugence <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#111:1:A>
And he says <,> that the radiance the lustre of truth <,> is so
<,> great is so wide <,> that he has only caught <,> the <,> <{> <[> faintest
glimmer </[>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#112:1:S>
<[> Faintest glimmer </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#113:1:A>
The dim fading light of <,> truth <w> he's </w> got <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#114:1:A>
And it passes off <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#115:1:A>
<}> <-> But this </-> <,,> <=> but this </=> </}> much I can say
with assurance as a result of all my experiment <,> that a perfect vision of
truth can only follow a complete realisation of <,> <indig> ahimsa </indig>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#116:1:A>
So one more thing he says is <,> that if you want to realise truth
to the fullest <,> if you want to see truth at its very <,> best <,> then you
have to <,> follow the path of <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa </indig> </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#117:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#118:1:A>
Know what <,,> <indig> ahimsa </indig> is <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#119:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#120:1:A>
Follow the principle of <,> <indig> ahimsa </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#121:1:A>
Only then you can have the full perfect vision of <,> <{> <[>
truth </[> okay <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#122:1:S>
<[> Truth </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#123:1:A>
So how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of
truth <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#124:1:A>
Yes <,> Pinky ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#125:1:S>
We can have perfect vision of truth by realising of <indig>
ahimsa </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#126:1:A>
Only if you realise <indig> ahimsa </indig> you can have the
perfect vision of <,> truth

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#127:1:A>
And <}> <-> how </-> <,> <=> what </=> </}> is the power of truth
he has described <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#128:1:A>
How has Gandhiji described truth ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#129:1:A>
Yes Ketan <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#130:1:S>
Like an <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#131:1:A>
Say it in complete <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#132:1:S>
Power of truth is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#133:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> the power of truth <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#134:1:S>
It is very powerful

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#135:1:A>
It is <,> very powerful

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#136:1:A>
It is uh <,> said that it is ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#137:1:C>
Million times more than that of the sun

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#138:1:A>
Million times more than that of the sun <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#139:1:A>
Okay <,> the radiance of truth is million times more than that of
the <{> <[> sun </[> <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#140:1:S>
<[> Sun </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#141:1:A>
To see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face
to face one must be able to love the <,> meanest of creation as <,> oneself
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#142:1:A>
And if <,> Gandhiji says that if you want to practice <,> <indig>
ahimsa </indig> <,,> practice <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,> which is found
everywhere <-> the </-> <,,> to practice truth which is there <,,> uh you
have to practice <,> <indig> ahimsa </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#143:1:A>
If you want to realise truth <,> you have to practice <indig>
ahimsa </indig> <,> and the most important thing is <,> you have to love <,>
all living <{1> <[1> creatures </[1> <,> and <,> <}> <-> the lowlest uh </->
<,> <=> the lowest </=> </}> of creation you should love as you love <{2>
<[2> yourself </[2> <,> okay <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#144:1:C>
<[1> Creatures </[1> </{1>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#145:1:C>
<[2> Yourself </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#146:1:A>
So to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth
face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as <,> oneself
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#147:1:A>
<-> So one </-> first of all one has to identify oneself with all
<,> living <,> creatures and love the lowest of <w> god's </w> <,> creation
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#148:1:A>
And a man who aspires after that <,,> and a man who <,> <{> <[>
speak </[> <,,> truth okay <,> who speak truth <,> cannot afford to keep out
of any field of <,> life <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#149:1:S>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#150:1:A>
So a man who is a seeker of <,> truth <,> has to be attached
to <,,> any field <,> of life in which he is <,> involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#151:1:A>
That is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of
politics <,> and I can say <,> without the slightest hesitation and yet in
all humility <,> that those who say that religion has nothing to do with
politics do not know what <,> religion means <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#152:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#153:1:A>
So he says <,> that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth
always in life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#154:1:A>
And because he was a seeker of truth <,> he was drawn to the field
of <,> politics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#155:1:A>
He wanted to make politics <,,> free from <,,> violence <,> and
that is why he entered <,> politics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#156:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#157:1:A>
So he says politics also should be free from <,> violence because
a seeker of truth <,> he has to follow the path of <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa
</indig> <,,> <indig> ahimsa </indig> <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#158:1:S>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#159:1:A>
Correct

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#160:1:A>
A seeker of truth has to follow the path of <{> <[> <indig> ahimsa
</indig> </[> <,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#161:1:C>
<[> <indig> Ahimsa </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#162:1:A>
And so he says that is why he had enter <,,> politics <,,>
<&> cough </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#163:1:A>
Identification with eveything that live <,> is impossible <,>
without <,> self-purification <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#164:1:A>
And he says <,> first of all <-> he says </-> that you have to
identify yourself with all living creatures <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#165:1:A>
All creation of <,> <{> <[> god <,> god <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#166:1:S>
<[> God </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#167:1:A>
You have to identify yourself amongst all creations of <,>
<{> <[> god </[> <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#168:1:S>
<[> God </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#169:1:A>
And he says if you want to identify yourself with all
creations of god <,> then <,,> you have to be <,> <{> <[> self- purified </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#170:1:C>
<[> Self-purified </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#171:1:A>
You have to be self-purified <,,> <&> cough </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#172:1:A>
Without self-purification the observance of the law of <indig>
ahimsa </indig> must remain an empty <,> dream <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#173:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#174:1:A>
And what is this self-purification <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#175:1:A>
Yes <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#176:1:S>
Self-purification means purification in mind word and deed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#177:1:A>
Purification of <,> mind <{1> <[1> word and deed </[1>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#178:1:A>
Your <,> thought <,,> <{2> <[2> speech and action </[2>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#179:1:C>
<[1> Word and deed </[1> </{1>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#180:1:C>
<[2> Speech and action </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#181:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#182:1:A>
So without self-purification he says <,> you cannot <,> follow the
path of <,> <indig> ahimsa </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#183:1:A>
And if you don't follow the path of <indig> ahimsa </indig> you
cannot realise <{1> <[1> truth </[1> which is <,> <{2> <[2> god </[2>
according to <,> <{3> <[3> Gandhiji </[3> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#184:1:C>
<[1> Truth </[1> </{1>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#185:1:C>
<[2> God </[2> </{2>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#186:1:C>
<[3> Mahtma Gandhiji </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#187:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#188:1:A>
God can never be realised by one <,> who is not pure at <,> heart
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#189:1:A>
So the first important thing of self-purification you have to be
pure at <{> <[> heart </[> <,> good in your deed <,> good in your <,>
thoughts <,,> action <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#190:1:C>
<[> Heart </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#191:1:A>
God can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#192:1:A>
Self-purification therefore must mean <,> purification in all
walks of <{> <[> life </[> <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#193:1:S>
<[> Life </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#194:1:A>
And this is very important because if you are self- purified
<,> you are good in <,> thought <,,> <{> <[> speech and action </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#195:1:C>
<[> Speech and action </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#196:1:A>
If you are good you can make <,> <{> <[> others good </[> <,>
okay <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#197:1:S>
<[> Others good </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#198:1:A>
So <,> he says that if you are self-purified you will
naturally see that your surroundings are also <,> purified <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#199:1:A>
It is also good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#200:1:A>
And purification being highly infectious <,> purification <,,> of
oneself necessarily leads to the purification of <,> <w> one's </w> <,> <{>
<[> surroundings </[> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#201:1:C>
<[> Surroundings </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#202:1:A>
So what does purification of oneself lead to <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#203:1:A>
Come on yes uh <,> you ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#204:1:S>
Purification of oneself means purification of the
surroundings

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#205:1:A>
Of <w> one's </w> <,> <{> <[> surroundings </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#206:1:C>
<[> Surroundings </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#207:1:A>
Whereever he is in any walk of life <,> he will see that <,>
everything else is also <,> <{> <[> purified </[> <,> is good <,> okay <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#208:1:C>
<[> Purified </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#209:1:A>
But the path of self-purification is hard and steep <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#210:1:A>
To attain perfect purity <,> one has to become absolutely
passion-free in thought <,> speech and action <,> to rise above the opposing
currents <,> of love and hatred <,> attachment and <,> repulsion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-011#211:1:A>
So he says <,> that we are talking on self- purification <,> but
it is not very easy to be <,,> self-purified <,,> because if you want to be
self-purified <,> you should be absolutely <{1> <[1> passion-free </[1>
emotion-free in <,> <{2> <[2> thought <,> speech and action </[2> <,,>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#212:1:C>
<[1> Passion-free </[1> </{1>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-011#213:1:C>
<[2> Thought speech and action </[2> </{2> </I>
