<ICE-IND:S2A-016#1:1:A>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#2:1:B>
Another Arjun award winner <,> this Sandhya Agarwal <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#3:1:B>
And of course we have the cricketing manager of the Indian side <,>
uh the third Arjun award winner <,> Santarangaswamy managing this team <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#4:1:B>
Diana Eduljee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#5:1:B>
Quite a delivery indeed <,> but the batsman <,,> there on the crease
<,,> unable to <,,> study the ball <,> unable to read the ball <,> are not
taking chances of leaving the crease <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#6:1:B>
Diana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#7:1:B>
Left arm round <,> on the leg stump <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#8:1:B>
No attempt for a shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#9:1:B>
And thirty nineth over completed with Diana completing her sixth
over two maiden ten runs and one wicket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#10:1:B>
In just misfield you see Franklin and Jose now discussing as to the
strategy what should be adopted <,> at this stage of the game

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#11:1:B>
The fortieth over <,> will be in progress

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#12:1:B>
The run rate here <,> as given by our scorer immediately <,> and
<w> it's </w> two point four <,> one <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#13:1:B>
Two point four one

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#14:1:B>
A very low <,> rate of scoring <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#15:1:B>
Not a recitable total to bowl at

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#16:1:B>
And Australia will have to do something about it right now <,>
before <w> it's </w> too late to recover from the say <,> of ninety-four for
six <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#17:1:A>
Pramila <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#18:1:B>
See <w> it's </w> Pramila from the Darya Ganj end Amar <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#19:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#20:1:B>
And still a spin attack going on although there is a slight
breeze on the <,,> uh ground today <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#21:1:B>
A little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can
see that <,> the pacers although not very successful they haven't been
operated for a long time <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#22:1:B>
<w> It's </w> the spinners who are taking the field today <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#23:1:B>
And first ball <}> <-> <.> fro </.> </-> <=> from </=> </}> Pramila
<,> going away from the <,,> point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#24:1:B>
Two runs <,> three runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#25:1:B>
Uh ninety-seven Franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#26:1:B>
The fortieth over in progress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#27:1:B>
How many overs have all today could you let me know <,,> number of
overs the pacers bowl today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#28:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#29:1:A>
One three O <,,> five <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#30:1:B>
Five overs <,> five overs each

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#31:1:A>
Five <,> each ten <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#32:1:B>
So ten overs have been bowled by the pacers

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#33:1:B>
See <w> it's </w> Pramila the right arm spinner <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#34:1:B>
And the leg stump <,> ball punished but Diana right there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#35:1:B>
The stroke coming in directly to the wicket <w> keeper's </w> hand
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#36:1:B>
And the Australian <,> run restricted to only <,,> two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#37:1:B>
Only one run being taken ninety-eight for six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#38:1:B>
Wonderful throw from the boundary line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#39:1:B>
For Franklin and Jose <,> we have told you <,> about the <,>
achievements of Franklin <,,> young player <,,> an upcoming player from the
Australian <,,> squad <,> who <.> ha </.> who are visiting <,> India <,> for
the first of the match <,> in the series <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#40:1:B>
Here is Pramila <,> right arm <,,> elbow <,> moved up <,,> and on
the off stump first into the covers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#41:1:B>
A little misfielding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#42:1:B>
Single there <,,> ninety-nine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#43:1:B>
Quicking towards that <,,> wretched mark of hundred <,,> but number
of overs <,,> bowled <,> a little too many for this <,> total ninety-nine for
six <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#44:1:A>
Appeal <,> Jose out

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#45:1:B>
And <,,> the appeal there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#46:1:B>
The response is positive by the umpire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#47:1:B>
You see the batsman returning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#48:1:B>
And Abhay <,> what do you think of this ball <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#49:1:B>
Jose goes back for <,> total of <,> individual total of seventeen
<,> this <,,> this session always <,> necessary <,> to <,> know what type of
bowling is there <,> and she has come on last evening say <,> she is a <,>
off spinner <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#50:1:B>
She is very <}> <-> <.> success </.> </-> <=> successful </=> </}>
bowler in the nineteen ninety-three World Cup <,,> where <,,> she had a <,,>
very good throw with wonderful fielding <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#51:1:B>
She is a very good fielder also <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#52:1:B>
And she is coming up from the <,> Darya Ganj <,> end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#53:1:B>
She gave her to guess that sneak off Jose <,> and Anju Jain was
right there behind the stump <,> collecting it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#54:1:B>
Anju <,> you can see her there <,> now reaching which is <,> behind
Franklin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#55:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> a wonderful shot off the toes <,> turning the
body a little bit <,> and uh <,> between the mid wicket and mid on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#56:1:B>
Three runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#57:1:B>
They wouldn't go for the fourth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#58:1:B>
A very fast running between the wickets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#59:1:B>
Before Aarti Vaidya return to ball <,,> three runs added

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#60:1:B>
Hundred completed for Australia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#61:1:B>
Hundred and two <,,> in forty point two overs and time taken <,> of
course time is not required in the over match <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#62:1:B>
And now we can get a little flavour of the one day <,> match <,>
being played here <,> between India and Australia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#63:1:B>
Very good delivery <,> bringing in the ball a little <,> Diana
Eduljee <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#64:1:C>
For a minute difficult to suspend <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#65:1:B>
Very articulate <,,> vital spot <,,> read the batting <,> and
there she is <,> frightened one this time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#66:1:B>
Two fielders outside that white <,,> line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#67:1:B>
Faster one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#68:1:B>
Not bowling to the field

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#69:1:B>
At the moment the faster one <,,> wanted to see how the batman <.>
ca </.> respond to such delivery <,> the long off and long on kept <,> but
<,> the last delivery was flatter and faster <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#70:1:B>
And batsman number eight <,> has <,,> twelve runs to the credit and
the <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#71:1:B>
By the spinners <,> and of course the spinners have been doing
remarkably well in this match <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#72:1:B>
Franklin taking T S Pramila <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#73:1:B>
Pramila is the captain of the <,,> champion side <,> which won the
Rani Jhansi Trophy the Air India team <,> and this is T S Pramila <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#74:1:B>
Another mis- fielding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#75:1:B>
Little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball
is retrieved by Lea Francis <,,> one run added hundred and three for seven
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#76:1:B>
Franklin <,> thirteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#77:1:B>
Valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#78:1:B>
Although the rate of scoring is low <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#79:1:B>
Australia now moving up <,> on to the target for better total <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#80:1:B>
The weather brightening up a little <,> the sun streaking in <,,>
and just when <,> the <,,> lunch break is coming <,,> the weather <,>
improving <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#81:1:B>
T S Pramila bowling Franklin <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#82:1:A>
Quick <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#83:1:B>
Bright facing T S Pramila <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#84:1:C>
Bright <,,> she is giving all the strike to Franklin <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#85:1:C>
And Bright <,,> played this ball <,> uncomfortably losing her
balance <,> going on the off side <,,> and not being able to <,> maintain her
balance to go for any type of stroke <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#86:1:B>
See here <,> Pramila <,,> elbow high <,,> right arm going over
<,> and this one bringing this one ball <,> from <,,> the off stump <,,> so
as it has to turn a little <,,> before she could <,> try this ball <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#87:1:C>
But not a good choice to get her fetch her any run <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#88:1:C>
The score remains at hundred and three for seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#89:1:C>
The forty second over being bowled <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#90:1:C>
Slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#91:1:B>
Two runs easily <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#92:1:B>
The cover being too close <,,> not moving <,> behind fast enough to
get <,,> underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for
seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#93:1:B>
The forty first to <,,> point two overs <,> at the moment the score
is hundred and five for seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#94:1:B>
Diana Eduljee <,> that mesmerising left arm spinner of India <,>
operating from the <,> club house end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#95:1:B>
On the leg stump <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#96:1:B>
A lovely bit of fielding indeed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#97:1:B>
And I think <,> the Indian squad now with a little bit of strike
from the Australian side <,> has awakened up to good fielding

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#98:1:B>
And Ria Sen <,> good cricket after a long time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#99:1:B>
A little subdued moving that has gone <,,> brightening up now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#100:1:B>
Short pitch <,,> right there in the middle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#101:1:B>
Fielded <,,> no run <,,> as Aarti Bajaj mid off <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#102:1:B>
Left arm going round <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#103:1:B>
Not a good contact and finally Shastri there at mid wicket <,,> at
the <,> square leg <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#104:1:B>
The bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#105:1:B>
Uh delivery on the leg side open up too early <,> the batsman open
up too early <,> uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive
stroke <,,> didn't go for a hit <,,> neither did she come for a forward
defence <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#106:1:B>
Hundred and five for seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#107:1:B>
Bright two <,,> Franklin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#108:1:B>
Attempted cut <,,> and of course successful with it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#109:1:B>
Two <,,> before the ball is retrieved by Aarti Vaidya <,> and
returned to the wicket keeper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#110:1:B>
Two uh added to the total of Australian total of hundred and five

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#111:1:B>
Now hundred and seven for seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#112:1:B>
Hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining <,> two overs
remaining <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#113:1:B>
This forty <,,> fourth over being bowled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#114:1:B>
T S Pramila from the <,> Darya Ganj end <,,> bowling to Bright
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#115:1:B>
Faster delivery <,,> and came in straight to the keepers hand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#116:1:B>
Anju unable to read that delivery of Pramila <,,> came off herself
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#117:1:B>
Lucky not to get it touched it with Bright <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#118:1:B>
Variations in <w> Pramila's </w> delivery the last one came in

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#119:1:B>
The last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two
maiden <,,> sixteen runs being given away <w> she's </w> captured one wicket
so far <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#120:1:B>
At delivery <,> and that is the intelligence <,,> Diana applies
whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to <,> the opposite side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#121:1:B>
She is always leading the batsman <,> she saw batsman ready for
setting out and uh <,> coming close to the ball <,> and uh here she is <,,>
with that classic delivery of hers in the last over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#122:1:B>
So Franklin returned <,,> to the <,> pavillion at the score of
hundred and seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#123:1:B>
And here is the last wicket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#124:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> Collin Rose Collin <,,> at the crease now to face
Diana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#125:1:B>
Five balls remaining <,,> </I>


<I>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#126:2:D>
<O> Two words </O> one day international <w> women's </w>
cricket match <,> which is being played between India and Australia <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#127:2:B>
Welcome to the Nehru Stadium <,> where the second one day
international between India and Australia is <,,> taking place <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#128:2:B>
We are <,,> with you <,,> when the third over is taking place <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#129:2:B>
And Rose Collin <,> just about to bowl the third over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#130:2:B>
This is the first ball in the third over a beautiful <,> ball it
is <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#131:2:B>
And I must tell you <,> my co commentator today is a great
cricketer Chandu Sarvate <,,> who <,,> is going to give you the <,>
commentary in Hindi in the second one day international match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#132:2:B>
The first ball from <,> the Australians <,> where India took three
runs

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#133:2:B>
And after that in the second over was a maiden over

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#134:2:B>
And this is the third over the second ball of the third over <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#135:2:B>
It is <,,> Anju Jain who is facing Rose Collins

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#136:2:B>
No runs to be taken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#137:2:B>
And <w> it's </w> a <,> the Australians <.> w </.> have already
proved their ability in the fielding <,,> in fielding as well as they have
done a good bit of bowling in the end <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#138:2:B>
And this Rose Collin <,> who <,> will be operating the opening
bowler <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#139:2:B>
She is operating from the club house end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#140:2:B>
The morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#141:2:B>
So this is going to be a fifty over match each side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#142:2:B>
Three overs <,> there is third over being bowled <,> five runs
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#143:2:B>
And uh <,,> the Indian <,> batsman now facing Rose Collins is
Aarti Vaidya the left handed batsman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#144:2:B>
And this <,> girl Rose Collins has been swirving the ball <,,>
with this weather <,> and have been able to really <,> disturb the batsman
from the very first over <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#145:2:B>
A six footer <,,> she said her mother is six feet four inches <,>
and quite a good height for a pace baller <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#146:2:B>
I must <,> tell you about this girl <,> Rose Collins who got a
very good average in the first <,> one day international <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#147:2:B>
Six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#148:2:B>
The runs given away matters in the one day international <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#149:2:B>
The bowler from the other end is now Joe Grace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#150:2:B>
In the first one day international it was Anjelo <w> O'Neil </w>
from the <,> other end

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#151:2:B>
But now it is <,> Joe Grace who is bowling from the hospital end
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#152:2:B>
Five for no loss

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#153:2:B>
India five for no loss <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#154:2:B>
Facing is Aarti Vaidya <,> and the bowler at the other end <,> is
<,,> Joe Grace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#155:2:B>
Joe <w> Grace's </w> average <,> in the Delhi one day <,> when she
came in to bowl <,> after five bowlers <,> her average was seven overs four
maiden eight runs and two wickets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#156:2:B>
And that effort of hers <,,> has brought her into the opening
bowling stand <,> and she is bowling from the hospital end now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#157:2:B>
And that was a marvellous ball <,> going away that too from the
left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#158:2:B>
And Joe Grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of
the team <,> the right arm fast medium bowler <,> has been utilising the <,,>
weather today <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#159:2:B>
The bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the
swerves in the flag <,,> and the flags waving <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#160:2:B>
Joe Grace coming in once more <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#161:2:A>
Aarti Vaidya <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#162:2:B>
And <w> that's </w> Olivia who returned the ball

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#163:2:B>
And before that <,,> we already have <,,> runs added to the <,,>
Indian total

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#164:2:B>
Three more runs added <,,> and valuable three runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#165:2:B>
And of course <,,> this wicket as Mister Salvador told you <,,> uh
is a good wicket <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#166:2:A>
<indig> Bahut acchi </indig> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#167:2:B>
Joe Grace from the hospital end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#168:2:B>
And she has been able to <,,> really beat the batsman once more
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#169:2:B>
Aarti Vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#170:2:B>
And being wrapped up in the pad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#171:2:B>
And Aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the
Indian team <,> score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in
the first one day international <,> is now facing Joe Grace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#172:2:B>
So that <,,> was the <,,> over of Joe Grace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#173:2:B>
And in this over <,,> she gave away <,> only two runs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#174:2:B>
Quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the
batsman <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#175:2:B>
She has been able to extract <,,> and get swing <,> the ball
keeping a little low of course <,> and that is one reason why the batsman
possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early <,> part of the
innings <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#176:2:B>
Rose Collins to resume

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#177:2:B>
One <,,> slip <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#178:2:B>
<w> We'll </w> show you the field placing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#179:2:B>
This is Rose Collins getting ready just seen beside the captain
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#180:2:B>
<w> That's </w> how her runner is a right arm bowler <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#181:2:A>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-016#182:2:B>
So that was before Julian Langle returned it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#183:2:B>
Runs added to the Indian total and total moves on to <,,> eight
for no loss <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#184:2:B>
Eight for no loss <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#185:2:B>
Rose Collins <,,> about to bowl <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#186:2:B>
The ball again came in to the left handed batsman

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#187:2:B>
And we <,> see the ball swirving out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#188:2:B>
Going out through a right handed batsman at <,,> one slip <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#189:2:B>
This is a left hander Aarti Vaidya <,> though the ball is <,,>
moving away from her <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#190:2:B>
And the first odd <,> right in <,,> on the wrapped up on the leg
<,> and <,,> there is an appeal from Rose Collins <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#191:2:B>
Turned early <,,> the ball came in late <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#192:2:B>
And Aarti Vaidya <,,> caught <,,> there <,,> a little outside the
wicket <,,> according to the judgement of the umpire <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#193:2:B>
And there she <,,> is just about to resume <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#194:2:B>
But she has to really be careful

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#195:2:B>
She has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#196:2:B>
And right on the stump once more but very careful this time is
Aarti Vaidya <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-016#197:2:B>
Taking her legs no <,,> gap between the bat and the pad <,,> and
she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other
closer seen but of course there is a double gully <,,> wide apart <,,> </I>
