Saturn no longer is the only ringed planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#4:1>
Space explorations of the last two decades have revealed the esistence
of a wide variety of rings around the other three giant planets.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#8:1>
ANYONE who has ever looked at Saturn through a telescope would agree
that the ringed planet is the most beautiful celestial object in the sky.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#9:1>
Even in a small, low-powered telescope its distinct shape, unlike
any other planet of the solar system, can be easily made out.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#10:1>
But the grandeur of its vast ring system becomes apparent only at
higher magnifications, and it is a magnificant sight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#11:1>
Since their discovery in early seventeenth century Saturn
remained the undisputed lord of the rings till 1977 when it lost its unique
distinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#12:1>
During an occultation study in March that year, rings were discovered
around another planet, Uranus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#13:1>
Two years later, photographs of Jupiter sent back by the <it>
<mention> Voyager </mention> </it> probes showed faint rings around the
largest planet of the solar family.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#14:1>
Finally, in August 1989, rings around yet another planet came to
light - - this time it was Neptune.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#15:1>
All the outer planets, besides their large size, now had another
common feature - - all had ring systems of their own.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#16:1>
Much of the credit for our new found knowledge about celestial rings
goes to the two <it> Voyager </it> missions which not only made new
discoveries but also revealed the already known rings of Saturn in their
true majesty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#17:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> PLANETS </smallcaps> </bold> , as distinct from
the stars, were known to ancient man because of their curious motion in
the sky, but their true nature became known much later.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#18:1>
It was only after Galileo turned his telescope towards the heavens
in 1610 that the planets were first seen as small discs unlike the stars
which appeared as points of light, Galileo had already found the four
large moons going round Jupiter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#19:1>
When he turned his telescope to Saturn he noticed what appeared to
be a large <quote> ` moon' </quote> on either side of the planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#20:1>
But to his surprise, the two moons did not move from night to night
as did the moons of Jupiter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#21:1>
What was more unusual was that <w> Saturn's </w> moons appeared fully
onethird as large as Saturn itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#22:1>
The finding was so odd that Galileo didn't dare to publish it as
such.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#23:1>
He wrote, <quote> " I have observed the furthest planet to be triple"
</quote> , and published it as an anagram.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#24:1>
As if a large planet with two large stationary moons were not odd
enough, the two <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> <O> photograph below,
column two and three </O> <O> caption </O> <quote> ` moons' </quote>
disappeared altogether when Galileo peeped at Saturn through his telescope
again two years later, they were back again in 1616, now shaped as two
<quote> ` half-ellipses' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#25:1>
Over the next four decades, other astronomers observed and drew <w>
Saturn's </w> changing appearance, some of them remarkably accurate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#26:1>
But none had the idea of a ring in mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#27:1>
The idea of a ring around Saturn first came from the Dutch
astronomer, Christian Huygens.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#28:1>
After observing the planet for some years with his improved
telescope, he realized that all the drawings could be explained if Saturn
were <quote> ` surrounded by a thin flat ring, nowhere touching, and
inclined to the ecliptic' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#29:1>
Like Galileo, he first published the sentence as an anagram, but
later published it uncoded in 1659. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#30:1>
As any regular observer of the planet knows, the appearance of
the rings changes as Saturn goes round its orbit because of the tilt of its
axis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#31:1>
Once evey six years or so the rings appear at a shallow angle when
they are fully visible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#32:1>
Then, six years later, as the rings turn edge-on, they become
invisible. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 10 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#33:1>
As better and more powerful telescopes became available,
everyone could see the rings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#34:1>
In 1675, Giovanni Cassini, the first Director of the Paris
Observatory, discovered that the ring was double - - a thick dark line
separated an outering from an inner one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#35:1>
This gap later became known as <w> Cassini's </w> Division. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#36:1>
But one puzzle still remained unsolved - - what were the rings
made of ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#37:1>
At first they were thought to be simple ring-shaped solid sheets
floating in space encircling the planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#38:1>
But this idea had to be given up if the laws of gravitation were to
hold.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#39:1>
Finally, in 1857, the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell came
up with the now accepted explanation that the rings are made of innumerable
separate particles all orbiting Saturn together as a crowd of miniature
moons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#40:1>
But the true complexity of <w> Saturn's </w> magnificent ring system
was not revealed till <it> <mention> Voyager </mention> </it> probes sent
back fabulous close-ups in the early 1980s. </p> <O> photograph below, column
one and two </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#41:1>
With powerful telescopes the rings of Saturn appear as a series
of concentric zones of different brightness.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#42:1>
Astronomers have identified each zone as a separate ring separated
by dark divisions, the two major zones flanking <w> Cassini's </w>
Division have been named A and B rings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#43:1>
Other rings, labelled <mention> C </mention> to <mention> G
</mention> , have also been identified.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#44:1>
Of the lot, the B-ring, stretching over 25,000 km, is the widest and
brightest, followed in brightness by the 15,000-km wide A-ring.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#45:1>
The others are mostly faint, thin rings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#46:1>
The outermost ringcalled E-ring is a very diffuses ring lying beyond
the orbits of three Saturnian moons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#47:1>
These arbitrary divisions of the rings, however, appeared
redundant after the flybys of Saturn by the <it> <mention> Voyager </mention>
</it> probes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#48:1>
The <it> <mention> Voyager </mention> </it> photographs showed that
the rings are not made up of large, relatively homogeneous zones as they
appeared from earth, but are in fact composed of thousands of thin
concentric rings, much like the grooves on a gramophone record. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#49:1>
The <it> <mention> Voyager </mention> </it> probes also revealed
several unexplained phenomena such <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> as
radial <quote> ` spoke'</quote>-like formations on the ring system and
ringlets which were non-circular, eccentric, twisted, wavy, or clumpy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#50:1>
All these structures pose a new challenge for physicists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#51:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> URANUS </smallcaps> </bold> joined the planetary
elite in 1977 when a system of rings was discovered during a stellar
occultation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#52:1>
Serendipity played the key role in the discovery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#53:1>
On 10 March 1977 the blue planet was to pass in front of a star in
the constellation of Libra.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#54:1>
Astronomers around the world including teams at <w> India's </w>
Kavalur and Nainital observatories were all geared up for the event as it
would provide them a rare opportunity to study the <w> planet's </w>
atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#55:1>
The technique is straight forward - - as the star went behind the
planet, its light would dim gradually if the planet had a thick atmospheric
envelope disappearing altogether.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#56:1>
The same would <O> <&> page </&> 11 </O> happen, but in reverse
order, as the star reappeared from behind the planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#57:1>
If the planet had no atmosphere, the extincton and reappearance of
starlight would be abrupt and almost instantaneous rather than gradual. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#58:1>
But that night something quite unexpected happened.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#59:1>
Not that scientists are unaccustomed to getting unexpected results,
but it is not always that a correct interpretation is so easily forthcoming
as was in this case.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#60:1>
Analysis of the occultation records showed that the light from the
star dipped at least five times before it went behind Uranus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#61:1>
Could it be due to some unknown satellites that were cutting off the
light?

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#62:1>
But the mystery was soon cleared as identical dips in signal were
recorded during the reappearance of the star after the occultation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#63:1>
The dips, the astronomers soon realized, could only be due to a
series of rings around Uranus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#64:1>
From the records it was clear that if Uranus indeed had rings, they
would be pretty thin and dark - - a far cry from <w> Saturn's </w> majestic
system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#65:1>
Later occultation studies led to the discovery of four more rings
making it a total of nine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#66:1>
The first photographic evidence of the rings of Uranus came in
1983 in <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> <O> photograph 1, over column
two and three </O> <O> caption </O> <O> photograph 2, over column two and
three </O> <O> caption </O> infrared pictures taken with the

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#67:1>
But their true form was revealed only in <it> <mention> Voyager 2
</mention> </it> pictures which showed them clearly as nine tidy bands.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#68:1>
The rings looked much as expected - - narrow, dark, and sharply
defined, with few surprises. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#69:1>
The third member of the solar family to receive the <quote> `
ringed' </quote> distinction was Jupiter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#70:1>
It was also an unexpected discovery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#71:1>
The first pictures of the thin ring of dust girdling the giant <w>
planet's </w> equator came from <it> <mention> Voyager I </mention> </it> in
1979.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#72:1>
But <it> <mention> Voyager 2 </mention> </it> gave more detailed
pictures which showed that the ring has a sharp outer edge, and stretches
down, fainter and fainter, towards the <w> planet's </w> cloud tops. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#73:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> discovery of the rings

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#79:1>
But Neptune was still left out of the exclusive club as no rings
had yet been discovered around it, although there had been speculation about
their existtence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#80:1>
Stellar occultation methods, like the one that led to the discovery
of the Uranian rings, had produced ambiguous results.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#81:1>
But many astronomers believed Neptune had a ring though not a
continuous one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#82:1>
They imagined <w> Neptune's </w> ring to be a discontinuous
<quote> ` ring arc' </quote> unlike any other planetary ring.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#83:1>
They were not entirely wrong, however.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#84:1>
Pictures sent by <it> <mention> Voyager 2 </mention> </it> clearly
show at least three rings, one of them with material mysteriously clumped
into three <quote> ` arcs' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#85:1>
It is not known what causes the Neptunian ring particles to clump
into arcs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#86:1>
In the last dozen years our conception of planetary rings has
undergone a revolution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#87:1>
From a single planet with rings known as recently as 1977, today we
know of four.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#88:1>
But no two of them are identical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#89:1>
Jupiter is girdled by a thin diffuse ring; Saturn rules over a
spectacular bright system with thousands of wide and narrow structures;
Uranus has the narrowest and darkest rings of the lot; while <w> Neptune's
</w> rings have clumps of matter strung like beads.

respects, though, all the ring syst ems show
some degree of similarity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#91:1>
They all lie close to the equatorial planes of their respective
planets, and they are all extremely thin, with typical thickness of only
about a kilometre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#92:1>
Detailed analyses of the sunlight scattered by the rings of Jupiter
and Saturn have shown that the Jovian rings are made up of <O> <&> page </&>
14 </O> <O> two photographs one beside another across the page </O> <O>
caption </O> micron-size particles ( 1 micron = 10<sp>-6</sp>m) and that the
particle size in the rings of Saturn ranges from 5 mm to 5m.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#93:1>
The particle size of the rings of Uranus and Neptune are not known
but they are believed to be no larger than a few metres across. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#94:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THERE </smallcaps> </bold> is as yet no single
theory that can explain all the planetary rings of the solar system, but it
is generally agreed that they are all the outcome of a variety of
gravitational interactions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#95:1>
For all planetary bodies there is a limiting distance called the
Roche-limit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#96:1>
Any satellite coming closer than this distance run the risk of being
destroyed by strong tidal interactions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#97:1>
It is speculated that <w> Saturn's </w> magnificent rings may have
originated from such a destructive event.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#98:1>
Rings could also be <O> <&> tantalizer </&> </O> formed out of
left-over matter from planetary accretion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#99:1>
Any such debris lying within the Roche-limit will fail to accrete
into larger bodies and continue orbiting the planet in the <w> latter's </w>
equatorial plane.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#100:1>
There is also evidence that some of the rings are shaped and
maintained by gravitational action of small <quote> ` shepherding'
</quote> satellites that orbit the planet at the same distance as the rings.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-030#101:1>
The celestial mechanics of ring formation and stability is
far too complicated to be expounded here.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#102:1>
But, simply said, planetary rings are a natural consequence of
tidal forces and collision among particles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-030#103:1>
From their study astronomers expected to learn more about the
important mechanisms that may have shaped our solar system in the distant
past. </p> <*> unfilled square </*> <*> tantalizer on page 15, column two
