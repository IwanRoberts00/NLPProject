<I> <O> Q.6 a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#1:1>
<h> <ul> Solar cell </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#2:1>
In <}> <-> todyas </-> <+> <w> today's </w> </+> </}> world, when
we are on the edge of 20th <&> ` 0' is overwritten in 20th </&> century, the
main problem of fuel is arising.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#3:1>
The conventional sources are rapidly decreasing & vanishing day by
day.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#4:1>
The wood, the natural oil, natural gas are vanishing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#5:1>
So the <}> <-> powerfull </-> <+> powerful </+> </}> item to get the
energy is to utilise the <ul> sun energy </ul> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#6:1>
Sun is whole day shining & therefore we can use the sunlight for
storing the energy in the form of heat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#7:1>
The useful instrument to acquire the solar energy is <ul> Solar
cell </ul> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#8:1>
<mention> Solar cell </mention> absorbs the sun energy in the form
of heat & stores it <}> <-> . So </-> <+> so </+> </}> that we can utilise
this form of heat energy in the industrial purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#9:1>
We have to discuss here, firstly the front view nature of solar
cell. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#10:1>
In the one panel of solar cell, so many solar cells are
constructed according to their purpose in the function. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#11:1>
<h> <ul> Diagram of solar cell </ul> : - </h> <O> figure </O> <O>
caption </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#12:1>
The solar cell consists of the main components as - - - > ( 1) An
absorber of good quality ( 2) Coverage material ( 3) Insulating material ( 4)
Storage section

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#13:1>
<h> <ul> Description </ul> : - 1) <ul> Absorber </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#14:1>
In solar cell, the <*> right justification </*> <ul> black points
</ul> of 2 - 50 cm in diameter <+> ( and it </+> absorbs light energy <+> )
</+> are constructed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#15:1>
The <mention> absorber </mention> is of such type that the absorption
coefficient of the material should be very high & it shows <ul> low emission
coefficient in the infrared light </ul> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#16:1>
Absorbers are generally black in <}> <-> colours </-> <+> colour </+>
</}> because absorptivity of black colour is <+> the </+> highest. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#17:1>
<h> 2) Covering material : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#18:1>
The solar cells are constructed on the insulating material which
is conducting because the heat absorbed by the black spots is transferred by
using conducting surface.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#19:1>
The whole solar cell panel is covered by the glass material, which is
active for sunlight & low active for infrared light. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#20:1>
<h> 3) Insulating material : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#21:1>
The stored energy in the form of heat should not be released, so
the insulating material is used to keep the heat in storage section. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#22:1>
<h> 4) Storage section : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#23:1>
Generally water or rocks are used for the purpose of storing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#24:1>
Silver salts can also store the solar energy 6 times larger to that
of water. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#25:1>
Thus in working of solar cell, when the absorber absorbs the
solar energy, then they are converted into electric energy by using photo
voltaic cell.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#26:1>
Thus the diameter or dimensions of photo cell are of 2 x 10
cm<sp>2</sp> in area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#27:1>
The flowing water is used as solar absorbing or conducting
material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#28:1>
So in <w> today's </w> world, it becomes an essential thing. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#29:1>
2) <h> <ul> Soft & hard magnets </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#30:1>
According to the use & the hysterisis curve the magnets are
divided into two types

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#31:1>
1) Soft magnets

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#32:1>
2) Hard magnets. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#33:1>
<h> <ul> SOFT MAGNETS </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#34:1>
Soft magnets are very useful in the construction of transformer
cores i.e. in the power sensitive devices, the soft magnets <}> <-> plays
</-> <+> play </+> </}> an important role. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#35:1>
Soft magnets are the magnets whose domain walls are mobile or
easy to move.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#36:1>
Thus soft magnets are easy to move when an external field is applied.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#37:1>
<}> <-> Genergy </-> <+> Energy </+> </}> for 50 to 60 Hz frequency
of A.C. the soft magnet behaves as a very useful tool for transformer <}> <->
core. </-> <+> cores. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#38:1>
The hysterisis loop for the soft magnet is very small in area on
B.H. curve. </p> <O> figure </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#39:1>
In the hystersis diagram, it is seen that the power consumption
is very small because area covered by hysterisis is very small. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#40:1>
So in the electric components such as wires, transformers
etc.<+>,</+> soft magnets are used. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#41:1>
2) <h> <ul> HARD MAGNETS </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#42:1>
In hard magnets domain walls do not move easily when external
field is applied.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#43:1>
Thus for a.c. power purposes hard magnets are not useful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#44:1>
But still, they are the <}> <-> paramanent </-> <+> permanent </+>
</}> magnets.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#45:1>
Because hysterisis loss for the hard magnet is greater as compared to
the soft magnets. </p> <O> figure </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#46:1>
Hard magnets have high initial permiability & maximum corecivity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#47:1>
Therefore in making the industrial mechanical parts or flywheels,
aeroplanes, the hard magnets are used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#48:1>
The usefulness of hard magnet is not in <w> it's </w> domainwall
property, but it lies in the brittleness & high strength property. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#49:1>
This is all about the soft magnets & hard magnets. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.7 a) </O> <&> This answer was scored out by the examiner </&> <O>
b) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#50:2>
<h> <ul> Type - 1 super conductors </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#51:2>
According to the degree of superconducting states, the
classification of super conductors is done. ( 1) Type - 1 superconductor :
- <O> figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#52:2>
When the superconductors are placed in the magnetic field, then
at a certain critical magnetic field, there is transition of the electrons
from lower state to excited state.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#53:2>
And the resistivity of metal becomes zero.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#54:2>
This state of the superconductor is called as the type - 1
superconductors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#55:2>
Type - 1 superconductors are also called as soft superconductors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#56:2>
They are having the critical / transition <}> <-> temp. </-> <+>
temperature </+> </}> same for same material.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#57:2>
Therefore type - 1 superconductors are used in the wires ( electric )
etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#58:2>
( 2) <h> Type - 2 superconductor : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#59:2>
In type - 2 superconductors, there is the transition of the
electrons, excluding flux at the certain point Hcl called as lower conducting
field. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#60:2>
In this state <del> su </del> it acts as superconductor

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#61:2>
But still increasing the electric & magnetic field, it becomes normal
metal at point HC2 called as upper conducting state. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#62:2>
Thus type - 2 superconductors have the two states HC1 & HC2 <O>
Figure </O> <O> caption </O> <mention> type - 2 super conductors </mention>
are also called hard superconductors which are useful in the large scale
industrial purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#63:2>
Thus in <mention> type - 1 <}> <-> su.cond. </-> <+>
supercunductor </+> </}> </mention> flux is totally excluded at the Hcl
point<->,</-><+>.</+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#64:2>
But in <mention> type - 2 <}> <-> su cond. </-> <+> superconductor
</+> </}> </mention> the flux is not excluded totally at Hcl but it remains &
at point Hc<sb>2</sb> it <+> is </+> totally excluded. </p> </I>


<I> <O> c) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#65:3>
<h> <ul> Meissner effect </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#66:3>
Meissner effect is very useful effect while considering the
B.C.S. theory of superconductors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#67:3>
When thesuperconducter is cooled in the magnetic field B, then the
flux inside the material is totally pushed outside it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#68:3>
This effect is <del> at </del> below transition temperature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#69:3>
This is called as <mention> <ul> Meissner effect </ul> </mention> .
</p> <O> Figure </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#70:3>
In fig ( 1) normal state of superconductor is shown in which
magnetic flux lines are passing through the material.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#71:3>
But at HC, critical field, at cooling rate of the transition <}> <->
temp, </-> <+> temperature, </+> </}> the magnetic flux lines are pushed
outside so that there are no <}> <-> mag. </-> <+> magnetic </+> </}> flux
inside the material & the resistivity of material is nearly equal to zero so
that large amount of current can flow through it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#72:3>
The Meissner effect is mathematically shown as - - <O> equations
</O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#73:3>
Meissner effect is very useful while considering the B.C.S. ground
state of superconductors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#74:3>
Thus in words, lastly it is shown that,

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#75:3>
When the superconducting material is cooled below the transition <}>
<-> temp </-> <+> temperature </+> </}> at HC, the magnetic flux lines are
pushed outwards. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.3 a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#76:4>
<h> <ul> Point defects </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#77:4>
Point <}> <-> defects </-> <+> defect </+> </}> is the main
feature of the solid state crystals i.e. there are point defects in solids so
that the useful applications are from point defects i.e. <}> <-> The </-> <+>
the </+> </}> crystal with point defects are <}> <-> shows </-> <+> shown on
</+> </}> <}> <-> color </-> <+> colour </+> </}> the growing property & the
interstitial state of the crystal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#78:4>
There are two types of defects according to their <ul> lattice
vacancies </ul> : ( 1) Schottky defect. ( 2) Frenkel defect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#79:4>
The concept of lattice vacancies arises due to the point defects.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#80:4>
In the crystal, if there is one place empty of the electron, then the
lattice vacancy <+> is </+> created.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#81:4>
Lattice vacancy is the empty state of crystal <-> in </-> where there
is no +ve or -ve charge present according to their intial electronic
periodic arrangement. </p> <O> Figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#82:4>
Generally, lattice vacancy is showed in crystal structure by the
square <*> the word ` square' is double underlined </*> <}> <-> In </-> <+>
in the </+> </}> above fig, <}> <-> There </-> <+> there </+> </}> is lattice
vacancy of the -ve ion

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#83:4>
Lattice vacancy is created due to the point defects. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#84:4>
<h> <ul> 1) Schottky defect </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#85:4>
In schottky defect, the atom is taken from <w> it's </w>
interstial planer or regular plane & it <+> is </+> taken out from it &
placed at the surface of the crystal layer.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#86:4>
This is called <mention> schottky defect </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#87:4>
Generally in alkali halides, lattice vacancies are created due to
schottky defect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#88:4>
Thus, when schottky defect arises, the density of the crystal reduces
& it becomes less dense<->.</-> <}> <-> Because </-> <+> because </+> </}>
vacancy is created. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#89:4>
<h> <ul> 2) Frenkel defect </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#90:4>
In this type of defect the atom in the regular plane is taken out
& placed in the interstitial position <}> <-> betn </-> <+> between </+> </}>
two regular planes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#91:4>
This defect is called as Frenkel defect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#92:4>
Here also, the density of crystal reduces while performing frenkel
defect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#93:4>
Generally, the silver halides shows Frenkel defect as lattice vacancy
is created </p> <O> Diagram : - </O> <O> diagram </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#94:4>
To show that elastic strain energy of screw dislocation is 2 / 3
of the edge dislocation of the same length in same material, we have to
derive some mathematical <}> <-> expression </-> <+> expressions </+> </}> :
- <O> figure on the left side </O> <O> captions and equations on right side
</O> <O> equations continued </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#95:4>
Therefore <O> abbreviation for ` Therefore' </O> <}> <-> Due </-> <+>

longitudinal stress, screw dislocation exists. <O> equation </O> <O> caption
</O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#96:4>
According to the the, Es = total elastic energy. <O> equation - - 1
<*> circled </*> </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#97:4>
According to the shearing stress, when elastic strain energy of screw
dislocation is 2 / 3 to that of edge dislocation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#98:4>
In edge dislocation, the energy for the dislocation arises <del>
lono </del> due to the shearing stress & in screw dislocation whole pattern
is slipped due to the longitudinal stess. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#99:4>
<*> mathematical notation for ` therefore' </*> <h> Therefore <ul> Gb
is the <w> Gibb's </w> function for elastic energy </ul> . </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#100:4>
From eq<sp>n</sp> 1 <*> 1 circled </*> it is seen that Es for
screw dislocation is <del> dire </del> equal to the 2 / 3 energy of edge
dislocation. </I>


<I> <O> b) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#101:5>
<h> <ul> Colour Centres </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#102:5>
<}> <-> Color </-> <+> colour </+> </}> centres are the point
defects or they are formed due to the lattice vacancy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#103:5>
Colour centres are formed due to the lattice vacancy of the -ve ion
or +ve ion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#104:5>
Generally colour centres are helpful to show the colour nature
of NaCl crystal <-> or </-> etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#105:5>
When the Alkali crystal is heated in contact with <w> it's </w>
own vapours, then the Nacl crystal becomes blue in colour.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#106:5>
This is why, colour centres are useful for the investigation of
crystal defects. </p>

<p> ( 1) Colour centres are called as the <mention> <ul> F-centre </ul>
</mention> also. F - centre is <}> <-> name </-> <+> named </+> </}> because,
it comes from Greek <}> <-> world </-> <+> word </+> </}> <foreign> <ul> Farb
</ul> - </foreign> for colour <*> the word ` colour' is double underlined
</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#107:5>
So in general F - centre is an electron vacancy in the crystal.
</p> <O> three figures, a, b & c </O> <O> three captions, a, b & c
respectively </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#108:5>
In fig. ( a) it is seen that there is -ve ion vacancy or
electron vacancy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#109:5>
This electron vacancy in crystal <+> is </+> called as F - centre.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#110:5>
The neighbouring F - <}> <-> centres </-> <+> centre </+> </}> forms
the M centre as shown in fig. ( b)

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#111:5>
Three K - centres <}> <-> forms </-> <+> form </+> </}> the R -
centre.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#112:5>
It is also easy to form the F - centre having hole as vacancy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#113:5>
In the study of electron spin resonance technique the invention of F
- centre is done.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#114:5>
It was seen that, there is absence of electron in crystal & that
excess electron <}> <-> shears </-> <+> <?> shares </?> </+> </}> or forms
cloud around that lattice vacancy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#115:5>
The electron can share <w> it's </w> energy with nearest +ve ions /
atoms.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#116:5>
Thus colour centres are formed. </p> <O> figure to the left </O> <O>

<p> In general, colour centres <}> <-> absorbs </-> <+> absorb </+> </}> the
light of certain wavelength, therefore some crystals are coloured in nature.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#117:5>
To investigate point defects, colour centres are helpful. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#118:6>
<h> <ul> Nematic mesophase </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#119:6>
The mesophase word is used to give the information about the
liquid crystals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#120:6>
The Greek word <foreign> Mesos </foreign> <-> - </-> means <->
the </-> <mention> intermediate </mention> & <foreign> phase </foreign> means
<mention> state </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#121:6>
Thus the intermediate state between crystaline & isotopic state is

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#122:6>
There are three different mesophases. <*> serial unmber 1 to 3

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-020#130:6>
The Nmatic mesophase is a three-dimensional state of liquid in
which the nematos are oriented in three dimension any where in the phase.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#131:6>

As the state is viscous & mobile, the dilution state is defined
using liquid crystal, nematics. </p>

The conversion from the crystal state to liquid state & vice
versa is studied by the enantiotropism & metatropism. <mention> C - SB - SC -
SA - I </mention>

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#145:7>
The state of isotropic liquid & the crystal is defined in terms of
liquid crystal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-020#146:7>
Therefore the nematic mesophases are used in investigating the
chemical composition of crystals.
