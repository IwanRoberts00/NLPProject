<ICE-IND:S2A-036#1:1:A>
Ah uhm <,,> uh thank you very much <,,> uh professor Kohli <,>  
spoke <,> so nice words about me <,> uh <,,> I don't know how much I deserve  
them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#2:1:A>
Uhm <,,> professor Kohli requested me to talk on <,,> <mention>  
National income uh accounts </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#3:1:A>
Uhm <,> my purpose here was <,,> to <,,> make things very simple <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#4:1:A>
Uh maybe <,,> what my idea was <,,> this is a <,> most of you are  
teachers <,,> and you know <,,> in a class <,> when you go to a class <,,>  
there are bright students <,,> there are <,> mediocres <,,> there are bit  
dull students also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#5:1:A>
So teacher has a big problem <,> of <,> uh satisfying all the <,>  
students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#6:1:A>
So now comes the question <,,> what level he should go <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#7:1:A>
It should benefit most of them 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#8:1:A>
So one has to be <,,> bit uh <,> see that everybody <,> follows <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#9:1:A>
Uh now we have <,> that gathering I see <,> most of you have put in  
some more than a decade of service <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#10:1:A>
And most of you are <,,> uhm <-> good good </-> having good  
experience in teaching <,> uhn <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#11:1:A>
What I want to do here is <,> only thing is some of you may not be  
having <,,> uh background about <mention> National income accounts </mention>  
and other things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#12:1:A>
Uh with that intention I want to <,> give some idea about <,> what  
<mention> National income accounts </mention> is <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#13:1:A>
How it is useful <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#14:1:A>
And how it is computed <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#15:1:A>
And then <,> in the second lecture <,> I would <-> give </-> try to  
give you <,> uhn <,,> the <,,> <.> backgr </.> the trends in <-> India </->  
<,> Indian economy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#16:1:A>
What is the per capita income of <-> a </-> India <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#17:1:A>
This thing <,> and how it is computed <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#18:1:A>
What are its weaknesses <,> this is for todays programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#19:1:A>
Uhm as I told in beginning this is <.> li </.> I would like to make  
it as simple as possible without <.> ma </.> uh this thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#20:1:A>
<-> I </-> my main idea is <,> that <,> everybody should get  
something uh <,> that is the thing <,> they should feel it okay <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#21:1:A>
Others who are <,> more interest in deeper questions <,> can  
approach me again uh <,> <-> your all </-> all the time you are welcome and  
<w> it's </w> a great pleasure to have <,> interaction with you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#22:1:A>
Now <,,> uh <,> if I ask anybody <quote> What is <}> <-> <.> in  
</.> </-> <=> income </=> </}> </quote> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#23:1:A>
<quote> What is your income </quote> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#24:1:A>
You may say some <,> six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand  
<,> things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#25:1:A>
But it <,> it looks to be very simple question <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#26:1:A>
But if we go deeper <,> it is not as simple as you think <,,> at  
the first time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#27:1:A>
Uhm <,> take uh <,> this income <,> somebody <,,> mainly we who are  
salaried person <,> by income we meant <,> whatever salary we are getting  
that monthly <,> that is the salary 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#28:1:A>
Or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there  
<,> after deductions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#29:1:A>
Okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is  
deducted <,> eight thousand is our take home salary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#30:1:A>
This we take it as a income <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#31:1:A>
This <,> but if we go deeper <,> this is not the only <,,> total  
income <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#32:1:A>
For example some of us may have some <,> own house <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#33:1:A>
In that way we also get a <,,> a rent <,> imputed rent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#34:1:A>
So our income consist not only of salary but also the rent <,,> of  
the house in which we are living because if we <,> go for some other rented  
house we had to pay that rent <,,> for that house <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#35:1:A>
Now because it is our own house we are not paying <,> so <,>  
indirectly it means that we are getting that much income 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#36:1:A>
We are not <,,> uh paying <,> cash <,> but because we are utilising  
that uh services of that residence <-> resident </-> <,,> it also means <,>  
it is uh rent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#37:1:A>
We are getting rent in <,> this thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#38:1:A>
Our income also should include <,> salary beside salary <,> it  
should include the rent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#39:1:A>
Some of us may have <,,> put some <,> fixed deposit in the bank <,>  
F D <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#40:1:A>
So annually we may get some interest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#41:1:A>
That also is a part of <-> the </-> our income <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#42:1:A>
That thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or <,> saving  
accounts in our bank <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#43:1:A>
<-> My maybe </-> it may be small amount <,> but <,> uh for uh <,>  
conceptual purpose it should be <,> included 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#44:1:A>
Maybe we may <,> if we take in our bank account <,> uh <,> may be  
interest we may <+> be </+> getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty  
<indig> rupees </indig> or hundred <indig> rupees </indig> <,> per annum  
because our <,> savings may not be much 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#45:1:A>
But it is also a part of our income <,> that interest that we get  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#46:1:A>
Then we may have bought some shares <,> or dividends <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#47:1:A>
Uh this is mostly the salaried persons <,> buy the shares and this  
things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#48:1:A>
The dividends that we get <,> on that uh shares <,> also <,,> a  
part of our <,,> income <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#49:1:A>
Next component we may think <,,> we may have some people may have  
agriculture land <,,> they at their own native place <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#50:1:A>
From agriculture they will be getting some <,,> either they may  
have leased out <,,> the land to some tenant and getting rent on it <,> that  
is a <,> rent from the land <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#51:1:A>
Or they may be having share cropping <,> they may contribute  
something to the <,,> cultivation <,,> and for uh tenants cultivates and they  
get <,> share cropping will be there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#52:1:A>
This also <,,> forms a part of our income <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#53:1:A>
So <,,> uh in the beginning when <,> you thought what is income <,>  
you <,,> took it <,> as salary <,> income means only salary <,> for salaried  
persons 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#54:1:A>
But actually if we go deeper <,> it includes many other components  
<,> which we generally <,> uh don't <,,> take care of <,> notice it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#55:1:A>
That it actually <,> income is such a broad concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#56:1:A>
When <,> income <-> is a <,> for </-> of a individual is so <,>  
difficult to <,> compute <,> or even assess <,> uh what about the <w>  
country's </w> income <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#57:1:A>
<w> Country's </w> income means income of all the people in the  
country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#58:1:A>
<w> It's </w> all the more difficult <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#59:1:A>
What we mean by <.> natio </.> income of the nation or national  
income <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#60:1:A>
The national income means the value of the output <,,> which is  
<,,> produced in the country <,> the <-> final goods </-> value of the final  
goods <,> produced in the <,> country <,,> is <,,> taken as national income  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#61:1:A>
Now here I use the concept final goods <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#62:1:A>
Why we should use final goods <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#63:1:A>
Because <,> if we don't <,> take account of this <w> we'll </w>  
have some problems called double counting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#64:1:A>
Suppose <,,> <.> wa </.> <,> if you want to <,> if you don't <,,>  
take care of this <,,> there is a problem of double counting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#65:1:A>
Suppose you take the case of <,,> uh a simple example which is  
given <,,> is about the <,> bread industry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#66:1:A>
So if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced  
in the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#67:1:A>
Total value of the wheat produced in the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#68:1:A>
Total <,> value of the fertiliser produced in the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#69:1:A>
There will be double counting <,> or treble counting <,> how <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#70:1:A>
When you take the value of the bread <,,> that value of the bread  
also <-> consist </-> <,> contains the value of the wheat used in the <,,>  
making of bread <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#71:1:A>
So <,,> <-> uh the <,> and </-> when you take the value of the  
total wheat <,> again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone  
into the making of bread also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#72:1:A>
Whatever that <,> all wheat produced in the country will not go to  
making bread but atleast some wheat <-> is </-> <,> goes in making of bread  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#73:1:A>
So <,> the wheat is counted twice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#74:1:A>
Wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread <,>  
wheat is also counted when <,> you are <,> taking the total value of wheat  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#75:1:A>
And also <,,> think of fertiliser which is used in making of <,,>  
this bread uh wheat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#76:1:A>
<-> Producing uh </-> <,> for producing wheat <,> we make use of  
fertiliser <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#77:1:A>
The value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat <,>  
again it is also contained in the value of <,,> uh bread <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#78:1:A>
So <,,> if you don't take care of only <,,> uh final goods <w>  
we'll </w> be commiting this <,,> uh <,> mistake of counting <,,> the same  
items <,> more than once <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#79:1:A>
So we should try to avoid this <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#80:1:A>
Now <,,> comes the question <,> how to know which is final good  
<,,> which is not the final good <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#81:1:A>
So <,,> is bread the final good <,> or is wheat the final good <,>  
is fertiliser <,> final good <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#82:1:A>
So <,,> because there is a difficulty in distinguishing <,> which  
is final good and which is intermediary good <,> we have another <,> to  
overcome this problem we have a method called <,,> value added method <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#83:1:A>
In that means <,,> uh <,> in each industry how much value is added  
<,,> by each industry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#84:1:A>
That we take into account not the total value of the output <,> of  
<,,> bread industry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#85:1:A>
<w> We'll </w> only take the <,> how much <,> bread industry has  
<,,> added the value to the product <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#86:1:A>
So baking <,> bread baking <,> so they have <,,> <.> pro </.> sold  
the bread at ten <indig> rupees </indig> <,,> and uh they have bought the  
input of <,> say <,,> eight <indig> rupees </indig> worth of inputs <,> for  
buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#87:1:A>
They have brought <,> uh purchased the bread industry has purchased  
eight <indig> rupees </indig> worth of inputs <,> and they have sold the  
bread for ten <indig> rupees </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#88:1:A>
So <,,> now <-> they </-> how much value they have added to this  
bread <,> they have added the value of ten two <indig> rupees </indig>  
because eight <indig> rupees </indig> was the value of inputs which they have  
purchased <,> <.> ei </.> ten <indig> rupees </indig> they have sold <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#89:1:A>
So <,,> that to bread uh <,> that final product which we <,>  
suppose we take it bread <,> for that bread they have added uh <,,> uhm <,>  
value of two <indig> rupees </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#90:1:A>
This is how we <,,> uh take it as <,,> uh value added <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#91:1:A>
So <-> one has to be </-> while computing national income <,> one  
has to be careful <,> in avoiding this double counting or counting the same  
item <,> more than once <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#92:1:A>
Then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in  
only money terms <,> because <-> we are </-> <,,> hetregenous items are  
produced <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#93:1:A>
Iron is produced <,,> uh foodgrain is produced so many items are  
produced <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#94:1:A>
So <-> it is a </- > <,,> it is expressed only in money terms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#95:1:A>
Agriculture output could have been produced in <,> uh mentioned in  
physical terms <,> whereas national income has to be expressed in <,> money  
terms 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#96:1:A>
This is another important <,,> thing to be noted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#97:1:A>
So we require some prices <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#98:1:A>
What prices should we use is another difficult question <,,> uh to  
answer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#99:1:A>
Then <,> we have to notice that it is a flow concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#100:1:A>
Flow means <,> how much output produced during a particular year  
or a particular month <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#101:1:A>
Instead <,> what is the value of uh <,> income means <,> income  
per month or income per annum <,> like that 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#102:1:A>
So flow means the period time period is important <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#103:1:A>
<-> It is a </-> national income <,> is a flow concept that means  
how much value has been produced from January first nineteen ninety-six to  
<,> December <,> thirty-first <,> nineteen ninety-six <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#104:1:A>
In this <.> aca </.> calendar year how much <,> is produced 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#105:1:A>
So it is a flow concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#106:1:A>
Uh these are the <,> some of the important things to be noticed  
about <,> a national income <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#107:1:A>
Now <,,> what is the use of national income <,> if it consist <,>  
outside <,,> if uh ask this question <,,> at which national income is <,,>  
used as a economic barometre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#108:1:A>
Like what is the condition of the economy <,> to know the  
condition of the economy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#109:1:A>
Like <-> a <,,> doctor </-> if you go to a doctor <,> before you  
ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#110:1:A>
And <,> he wants to know the temperature <,,> uh things 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#111:1:A>
So <,> a economist also <,> if he wants to know the condition of  
any economy he says what is <-> per </-> national income of the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#112:1:A>
So <,,> that means some uh <,,> weaknesses in this national income  
<,> but it broadly indicates <,> the health of the economy <,> how good how  
<,> sound is the health of the <,> economy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#113:1:A>
So <,,> this is necessary <,> national income is necessary to know  
<,,> health of the economy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#114:1:A>
And also we can compare <,,> two economies <,> which economy is  
stronger <,,> economically <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#115:1:A>
For intercountry comparison is also it is useful <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#116:1:A>
So how <,> so America is rich you know <,,> <-> how much in a </->  
what is the per capita income in India what is the per capita in <,> America 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#117:1:A>
Say twenty times it is more than in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#118:1:A>
Or thirty times more than in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#119:1:A>
So that shows how rich they are <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#120:1:A>
So for <,> in <,> relative comparison also <,> this uh <,>  
national income is <,> useful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#121:1:A>
Then within the country also <,> we have so many different states  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#122:1:A>
And we want to compare <,> uh which state is better <,,> which is  
doing well <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#123:1:A>
So which is richer state <,> uh <,,> like that 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#124:1:A>
So <-> interstate comparison also </-> to make interstate  
comparison also <,,> this uh <,,> <.> na </.> state income <,,> uh estimates  
are being made these days <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#125:1:A>
Then <,,> we <,,> know over a period of time <,> how country is  
growing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#126:1:A>
To assess <,> the performence of an economy also <,,> this <.> pe  
</.> national income data is very useful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#127:1:A>
Then you can also see <,,> uh that uh <,,> in the economy there  
are different sectors <,> like household sector we have <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#128:1:A>
We have <,> corporate sector <,> we have government sector <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-036#129:1:A>
What is the interaction of these sectors <,> that is how much <,,>  
how much <-> is </-> government sector is taking away from the household  
sector <,> how much government in the form of tax <,> how much government  
sector is taking away from the corporate sector <,,> in the form of tax <,,>  
</I>
