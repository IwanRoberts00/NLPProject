Question number one twenty-one ( c) <,> M V V S Murthy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#2:1:A>
<indig> Shri </indig> Murthy please <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#3:1:A>
<indig> Shri </indig> Bolabuli Ramaiah <,> <X> ( a) When the
government have signed any contracts with the private companies <,> for
development of small oil and gas fields <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#X4:1:A>
( b) If so the details there of <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#X5:1:A>
( c) Whether the process of privatisation of hydro-carbon sector
has been considered <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#X6:1:A>
( d) If so the contracts being initiated at present <,> and

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#X7:1:A>
( e) <,> The total contracts signed between the government and
private sector </X> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#8:1:B>
First <,,> ( a) to ( e) the statement is laid on the table of
the house sir <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#9:1:C>
Speaker sir <,,> I would like to <,> know from the honourable
minister <,,> when the government is supposed to <,,> open all those areas
which are exposition for not early <O> one word </O> open to the security
reasons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#10:1:C>
If so <,> how many such are likely to be opened at the earliest
area <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#11:1:C>
And another thing I would like to know <,,> the wealth which have
been not properly <,,> or defeated <,> whether they are able to plan any <,>
new systems <,> that will enable to increase the fertility <,> in order to
increase the requirements of the crude <,> in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#12:1:C>
The honourable minister has made a statement saying within three
years <+> they </+> have increased to <,> upto sixty percent of the last <,>
<}> <-> <.> pre </.> </-> <=> previous </=> </}> production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#13:1:C>
And I would like to know how you will able to achieve that results
<,> and <,> if you can <+> be </+> able to give some information I would be
happy <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#14:1:B>
The security <,> clearance is required <,,> for opening up uh
<,> the <,> areas

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#15:1:B>
Before that <,> uh we have to get the security <,> uh clearance
required

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#16:1:B>
And normally after we get the security clearance those areas are
opened up <,> for either explanation or production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#17:1:B>
Specially where <,> they are outside investors <,> foreign
companies involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#18:1:B>
Uh the second part of the question uh <,,> uh on what steps are
being taken <,> to enhance the production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#19:1:B>
Sir there are various steps which are being undertaken <,,> right
from <,> Bombay High which is the largest field <,,> there is a <,,> what you
call the E O R uh <,> enhance oil recovery <,> uh proposal which is being
evaluated

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#20:1:B>
There are five companies <,> who have <,> uh bid for this proposal
<,> which will <,> improve our production <,> from the Bombay High <,> that
is being considered <,> because there will be substantial improvement from
the existing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#21:1:B>
Besides that also of other fields <,> we are looking at <,> uh
geo-techniques and other <,> technology to come in <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#22:1:B>
Like the horizontal drilling in all other method <,> to see how we
can augment the all production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#23:1:B>
And as far as the third third part of the question <,> is concerned
the sixty percent production rise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#24:1:B>
Yes sir they are very much in place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#25:1:B>
This year the production is going up by five million tonnes <,>
that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#26:1:B>
This year the production goes upto thirty-two <,> next year
thirty-eight <,> and in the year ninety-seven <,> I am glad to inform the
house <,> the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point
five sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#27:1:B>
<w> That's </w> what the situation is <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#28:1:C>
Speaker sir <,,> as per the Eighth plan <,> what the
honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million
<,> and if we achieve those it will be happy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#29:1:C>
But whether they are going to do all the things within our own
country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also <,> where it is
possible <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#30:1:C>
Whether the O N G <w> C's </w> make any <,> new survey <,> in Andra
Pradesh Tamil Nadu <,,> Kerala and Gujarat <,> for new areas for new
development <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#31:1:C>
Whether they are able to make in order <}> <-> to </-> <+> as </+>
</}> requirements are going up

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#32:1:C>
By two thousand years <,> what is the total demand ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#33:1:C>
How much we have to import ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#34:1:C>
How much you can produce within the country <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#35:1:C>
And other important item is <,> the driving <,> technicians which
is required in this country are terribly shortage <,> and we are depending
more from outside <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#36:1:C>
Whether we will have a training school that we can develop them
within the country <,> I would like to know from the honourable minister <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#37:1:B>
Sir the <,,> strategy for oil explosion explosion in
production <,,> is to get <,> India its share in the global oil

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#38:1:B>
That means India must have <,> its equity in the global oil <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#39:1:B>
Hence <,> we are looking for <,> oil within the country and outside
the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#40:1:B>
We are going to be exploring and getting <,> trying to explore
opportunities for producing oil outside <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#41:1:B>
Vietnam is the classical example <,> where O N G C <indig> videsh
</indig> <,> started looking for oil <,> in the Vietnam borders <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#42:1:B>
And I am glad to inform the honourable members <,> that in Vietnam
we have found gas <,> natural gas

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#43:1:B>
The commercial study is right now under way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#44:1:B>
Similarly <,> we have <,> taken a block in Egypt <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#45:1:B>
We are negotiating with Yemen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#46:1:B>
And there are various other places we are seeing <,> besides
looking for oil and gas within the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#47:1:B>
So that we don't miss the bus <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#48:1:B>
All this company this is a global phenomenon <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#49:1:B>
You look at all the majors <,> whether it is British petroleum <,>
British gas all the major <O> one word </O> in the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#50:1:B>
They are not only looking in their territory they are also looking
globally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#51:1:B>
So the idea is <,> India should be <,> self-sufficient in oil and
gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is <,> the strategy
we are following <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#52:1:D>
Regarding the survey <,> in Andra Pradesh other areas has not
made any reply sir

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#53:1:E>
Thank you very much <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#54:1:A>
V K Bhat <,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#55:1:F>
A new <,> O N G C has found a <,> struck a new biggest field
in Terambulam village <,,> in the Ramnagaram district of south southern Tamil
Nadu <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#56:1:F>
If so <,> will the ministry beg the O N G C <,,> to drill more
wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#57:1:B>
Sir <,,> I would like to convey to the honourable members in
the house <,,> that wherever and whenever we find <,> presence of hydrocarbon
<,> whether it is in the form of gas or crude <,> the logical next step is
<,> more wells are <,> drilled <,> to de-alianate the fields to find out what
is the <,> quantity of the gas <,> and oil which is there

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#58:1:B>
So that process <,> definitely wherever it happens it is <,>
automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#59:1:B>
Only then we come to a conclusion <,> as to what is the size of the
reservoir what is the size of the <,> <O> one word </O> reserves we have

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#60:1:B>
So that will be worked again <O> a few words </O>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#61:1:F>
Sir is this a fact that Terambulam <,> has been has been cut
short

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#62:1:A>
Mr Rao please <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#63:1:G>
Mr Speaker sir <,,> though <,,> taking the <,,> involving the
foreign <,> companies <,> in the oil exploratiion <,> is unavoidable to some
extent <,> I would like to know from the honourable minister <,> in view of
the fact that O N G C have invested and spend <,> thousands of <indig> crores
</indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> and after great great deal of efforts <,>
after very long years <,> some oil fields and gas fields have been identified
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#64:1:G>
My question to the honourable minister is <,,> why not the
government of India <,> his ministry <,> to allocate new fields which are not
yet explored to the foreign companies <,> and take up oil exploration and
drilling operations by O N G C and our Indian oil companies ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#65:1:G>
Various companies are there <,> and by <,,> giving issuing shares
to the public <,> and raising <O> one word </O> into the ratio <,> in the
ratio of one is to four <,> definitely the O N G C and other oil companies
<,> will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our
efforts <,> and kindly <O> one word </O> why not the government reconsider
its special policy offer giving on platter to this M L <w> C's </w> the
precious oil resources <,> and confine only to the new fields which are yet
unexplored

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#66:1:G>
I would like to have a categorical answer <,> from the honourable
minister <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#67:1:B>
Sir I think the honourable member is referring to the
discovered oil fields <,> which were found out to <,> the <,> Indian and
international companies <,> in the past <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#68:1:B>
Sir <,,> I would like to <,> convey to the honourable member <,>
that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two <,> our foreign
exchange reserves our foreign exchange <,> the resource crunch was so severe
<,> that we had some of these fields <,> which we had found <,> which we had
discovered <,> ten to twelve years ago

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#69:1:B>
So for years they were lying <,> dormant <,> oil was in place but
they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch <,> on one hand
and the other that O N G C <,> was fully committed with whatever funds and
<O> one word </O> it had

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#70:1:B>
For other <,> which they considered more important projects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#71:1:B>
So to bring the oil on stream <,> in the earliest possible time
frame because of the severe <,> oil crunch <}> <-> with </-> <+> which </+>
</}> the country was facing

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#72:1:B>
To save <,> the foreign exchange on the import bill <,> we decided
to give some of these fields <,> after ensuring <,> that ( a) O N G C is <O>
one word </O> to the partner to the extent of forty percent <,> ( b) that we
get the right technology that the production costs are <,> lower than even
what <,> O N G C uh would have spent

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#73:1:B>
So after taking all these factors into consideration <,> we
negotiated in the best interest of O N G C and country sir <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#74:1:G>
But we have to purchase at international market prices <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#75:1:B>
It still comes to <,,> uh commercially speaking <,> uh to give
an idea <,> a uh <,> that for a given field <,,> where the O N G C is a
partner <,,> like the Panno Mukhta <,> Tapti <,> Rava <,> the kind of
investments which were required then <,> or even now when they start
operating the fields <,> is over a billion dollars and what are we giving
them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#76:1:B>
We are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen
percent that they return

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#77:1:B>
The rest <,> ninety percent in some cases a little less <+> than
</+> the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#78:1:B>
So it is in the best interest sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#79:1:B>
India is not the only country which is doing it

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#80:1:B>
This is being done as a regular programme in Argentina <,> in
Russia in China <,> all over <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#81:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a part of the thing to attract these companies who
will get into this crude oil fields and then <,> going to as you are saying
the future exploration project and it has already happened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#82:1:B>
Some of these companies like Enron <,> and Kaman petroleum <,> and
Indian companies like Videocon or uh <,> uh the Reliance <,> they have moved
now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into
exploration which is the key area <,> reserve exploration is the biggest
challenge from within the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#83:1:B>
We have to have domestic company <,> we have to have international
companies <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#84:1:B>
This the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five
percent of the total reserve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#85:1:B>
What is more important is to get this investment into extension
area so that we can find new oil for the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#86:1:B>
Another Bombay High <,> reserve efficience goes up <w> that's </w>
the biggest challenge for the country <,> and this will bring bring about
this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#87:1:A>
Mr Shahabuddin <,,>

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#88:1:H>
Mr Speaker sir <,,> in his reply the honourable minister <,>
has referred to fourteen fields <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#89:1:H>
Now if <,> I recall sir <,> in the seven <,,> international rounds
of bids <,> that we had offered <,> I believe that around fifty or sixty <,>
different <,> blocks <,> or fields are involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#90:1:H>
Now I would like to know from the honourable minister <,> the
reason for the delay <,,> in <,,> response <,,> in respect of the large
number of blocks that we had offered <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#91:1:H>
And for this the minister has not <,,> told anything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#92:1:H>
And secondly I would like to know <,> he has said that the first
five fields <,> are going under a production sharing <,,> uh contract <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#93:1:H>
But about the other eight more small fields <,> he has not
mentioned <,> the type of contract <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#94:1:H>
So I would like to know whether that is also <,> in the nature of
production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#95:1:H>
So first is the un <,> the <,> fields that we have offered to which
we have received no response and the reason therefore <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#96:1:H>
And <,> then these fields that have been now put under contract are
going to come on a stream <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-055#97:1:B>
Sir <,,> the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth
round and the sixth round <,> that was the continuous <,> continuous round of
bidding for explanation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#98:1:B>
The subject matter which is being discussed right now does not
relate to explanation <,> is mainly focused on discovered oil fields <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#99:1:B>
As far as the other the second part of the question <,> which
refers to the small fields and the type of contract <,> we have got into <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#100:1:B>
For the small fields <,> unlike the discovered oil fields where I
said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a
billion dollars <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#101:1:B>
Here the small fields are so small <,> that they are actually not
economically viable for a company like O N G C and <O> one word </O> <,> to
handle <w> that's </w> why they were bound out and we have Gujarat uh uh <,,>
Government Company Public Sector Company <,> and some other companies which
have got to gather on their own <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#102:1:B>
In these small fields <,> unlike the <,> medium size fields <,>
here there is no joint sharing

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#103:1:B>
These are very small <,> uh the risk will be taken <,> uh by those
companies <,> who will be producing the small amounts of gas and uh <,> uh
crude wherever it is in the small small <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-055#104:1:B>
See <w> it's </w> not a joint venture <,> unlike the medium <,>
size fields which are mention <,> which are joint ventures where O N G C and
the <,> other companies are partners </I>
