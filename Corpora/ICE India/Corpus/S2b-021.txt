<ICE-IND:S2B-021#1:1:A>
Kerala <,,> is the southern most <,,> part of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#2:1:A>
We are having <,,> many <,> theatrical art forms <,,> and  
performances <,,> as a part <,,> of our culture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#3:1:A>
Among <,> our <,,> classical <,,> theatrical arts <,,> <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> <,,> is the foremost one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#4:1:A>
Perhaps <,,> we may be able to point out <,,> <mention> Chakyarkuta  
</mention> <,> and <mention> Kudiyatam </mention> <,,> are the <,,> more  
ancient forms of classical art forms <,,> <mention> Kathakali </mention> is  
more popular <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#5:1:A>
We have got <mention> Krishnanatam </mention> <,,> which might have  
<,> originated <,,> before <,,> <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#6:1:A>
Actually <,,> the first term used for <mention> Kathakali </mention>  
<,,> was <indig> Aatam </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#7:1:A>
And the first performance was based on <,,> the Ramayana theme <,,>  
<mention> Ramanatam </mention> <,,> composed <,,> in <,> seventeenth century  
or later sixteenth century <,,> by Kottarakartampuran <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#8:1:A>
At that time <,,> this <mention> Ramanatam </mention> was not so  
sophisticated <,,> and it was not perfect <,> in any sense <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#9:1:A>
<mention> Ramanatam </mention> <,,> is a story <,> on drama <,,>  
based on Valmiki Ramayana <,,> divided into eight parts <,,> just as <,,>  
<mention> Krishanatam </mention> is <,,> framed <,,> in eight <,,> days play  
form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#10:1:A>
<mention> Krishanatam </mention> was popular in the south <,>  
northern part of Kerala <,> while <mention> Ramanatam </mention> was popular  
<,> in the southern <,> areas <,> of the <-> play uh </-> land <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#11:1:A>
<mention> Ramanatam </mention> <,,> though <,,> was <,,> spreading  
slowly <-> in </-> <,> throughout Kerala <,,> gradually <,,> another composer  
<,,> Kotesampuran <,,> who lived in <,,> seventeenth century <,> composed  
<,,> four stories <,,> based on <,> Mahabharata <,,>  
Nivathakavachakalakeyavatham <,,> Bhagavadham <,,> Karmiri <,> Karmirivatham  
<,> and Kalyanasaugandhikam <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#12:1:A>
Among these four plays <,> Kalakeyavadham <,> became very popular  
<,> on the Kathakali stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#13:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> Kot </.> </-> <=> Kotechidambaran </=> </}> <,,>  
composed these <indig> Aatakathas </indig> <,,> and uh they are <,> very  
popular <,> of course <,,> but the major contribution to Kathakali stage <,,>  
by Kotechidambaran <,> is that <,> he has stabilized <,> the <.> wa </.>  
method of presentation of this <indig> atam </indig> <,,> making much  
improvements <,> on <,> Ramanatam technique <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#14:1:A>
So <,,> the system evolved by Kotechidambaran <,,> was popularly  
known as <,,> Vettadda Sampradayam <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#15:1:A>
And <,,> from Kotechidambran <,,> <mention> Kathakali </mention>  
<,,> became <,> a sophisticated classical theatrical art of Kerala <,,> and  
uh <,> as far as the visual aspect of Kathakali <,,> no major attempt was  
made <,> to make <,,> a stabilisation <,> in this art form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#16:1:A>
But <,,> in the later years <,> there were <,> many other styles  
just like <,,> Kannadikot Sampradayam <,,> Kapling art Sampradayam <,>  
etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#17:1:A>
This Kapling art Sampradayam <,,> is the eighteenth century <,,>  
modification <,,> made by <,,> one Kapliknot Nambudri <,,> which the then  
Maharaja of Travancore <indig> Shri </indig> Kartigeternol Dyamavarma <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#18:1:A>
Kartigeternol Dyamavarma <,> composed <,,> not only <indig>  
atakathas </indig> <,> but he <,> made a <,,> uh technical book <,,> a  
theatrical book <,> a theoritical book <,> Balaramabharatam <,,> that is also  
<,> a very concrete evidence for the stabilisation of this art form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#19:1:A>
As far as the technique of Kathakali is concerned <,,> it is a  
combination <,,> of <,> the three forms of <indig> abhinaya <,,> nrita <,>  
nritya </indig> and <indig> natya </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#20:1:A>
And in <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,,> we find <,,> <indig>  
padarthabhinaya </indig> <,,> in <,> dense quality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#21:1:A>
As <,,> <indig> padarthabhinaya </indig> is there <,> we find  
<indig> bhavatmaka </indig> character <,> also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#22:1:A>
Every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor <,,>  
according to the word <,> and according to the <indig> bhava </indig> <,,>  
for the relevant <,> context <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#23:1:A>
And <,> we find <indig> natya </indig> aspects we find <,> <indig>  
nritya </indig> aspect <,> we find <indig> nrita </indig> aspect also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#24:1:A>
There are four types of <indig> abhinayam <,> aangika <,> aahariya  
<,> wachica </indig> <,> and <indig> satvica </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#25:1:A>
This <indig> aahariya abhinaya <,> abhinaya </indig> <,> or action  
based on the costumes <,> is very relevent <,> to <mention> Kathakali  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#26:1:A>
The <,,> costumes are uh <,,> planned <,> on the basis of <indig>  
satvaguna <,> rajoguna </indig> <,> and <indig> tamoguna </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#27:1:A>
There are <,> different terms used for costumes <,> <indig> pachha  
<,> minikka <,> katti <,> tadi <,> kari </indig> etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#28:1:A>
These are <,,> for various characters <,,> according to the story  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#29:1:A>
And uh <,,> in the uh <,> <indig> aangika abhinaya </indig> context  
<,> we have to point out one <,,> very important aspect <,> that is the  
gestural language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#30:1:A>
The <indig> hastamudras </indig> <,> are employed in <,,> in a very  
<,> profused manner <,,> based on <,> either <indig> natyashastra </indig>  
<,> or <indig> hastalakshnadeepika </indig> <,> or <indig> balarambharatam  
</indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#31:1:A>
Perhaps all these steps might have used by <,> the <,> uhm foremost  
compositors and <,> actors <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#32:1:A>
<indig> Hastalakshnadeepika </indig> contain <,,> of course it is a  
Kerala text on <,> gestural language <,,> uh this <indig> hastilakshnadeepika  
</indig> <,,> gives a <,> very good evidence <,> for the <indig> aangika  
abhinaya </indig> technique <,> employed in <mention> Kathakali </mention>  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#33:1:A>
And all the actors see that they are basing on <,> uh <indig>  
hastalakshanadeepika </indig> <,> where <,> the twenty-four <indig>  
hastamudras </indig> <,> the <indig> samyuta mudra </indig> <,> the <indig>  
asammita mudra </indig> etcetera are <,> uh used <,> and utilised for each  
purpose <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#34:1:A>
For example <indig> pataka tripatakam <,> mudra kadagamugham <,> uh  
shukatundam </indig> <,> all these <indig> mudras </indig> are <,,> uh  
employed <,> in this gestural language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#35:1:A>
Likewise <,> the <indig> rasabhinaya </indig> <,,> the <indig>  
satyakabhinaya </indig> <,> for that the <indig> navarasabhinaya </indig> is  
very important <,> for each and every character <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#36:1:A>
We <,> take valour <,> <indig> singara <,> karuna <,,> uh shoka  
</indig> <,,> or uhm <,> <indig> hasya </indig> <,> all these <indig> rasas  
</indig> are being depicted <,> in <,,> <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,>  
but the presentation is <,> on basis of <indig> bhavas </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#37:1:A>
<indig> Padarthabhinayatpada </indig> <,> and <indig> bhavatmaga  
</indig> is <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#38:1:A>
So <,,> <indig> bhava </indig> is being conveyed through each and  
every word of the composition <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#39:1:A>
The actor is presenting <,> his action on the basis of this <,,>  
<indig> pada </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#40:1:A>
<indig> Pada </indig> is <,> sung by <,,> or the <}> <-> <.> wak  
</.> </-> <=> <indig> wachikyabhinaya </indig> </=> </}> is performed by the  
musicians <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#41:1:A>
The compositions are written in various <indig> ragas </indig> and  
<indig> talas </indig> <,> restricted to <,> the Kathakali style <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#42:1:A>
The <-> that </-> style of singing is <}> <-> often called as </->  
<,> often called <+> or </+> referred as <,> <indig> sopan sangeeta </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#43:1:A>
<indig> Sopana </indig> is a word used for <,> a particular method  
of singing <,> songs especially the geetagovinda songs <,> on the steps of  
the shrine <,> in every temple <,> in Kerala <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#44:1:A>
So that is called <indig> sopana </indig> style <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#45:1:A>
This <indig> sopana </indig> style is being adopted in Kathakali  
singing <,> uh eventhough there are <indig> ragas </indig> common to Carnatic  
music and <indig> sopana </indig> style of singing <,> the method of singing  
the rendering of singing <,> is very different in <indig> sopana </indig>  
style <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#46:1:A>
Uh <mention> Kathakali </mention> composers <,,> uh adopting the  
<indig> sopana </indig> style and there is an evidence in the <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> <,> that <,> uhn they incorporated item <,> <indig>  
manjutala </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#47:1:A>
It is also called as <indig> melappada </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#48:1:A>
This <indig> manjutala </indig> is a first portion of a <indig>  
pada </indig> in <,> uh Geetagovinda <,> <indig> manjutala kunjatala  
kelisadane </indig> <,> that portion is being <,> sung at the beginning of  
every performance of <mention> Kathakali </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#49:1:A>
And that denotes the adoption <,> of Kathakali style <,> from the  
singing method of a <indig> ashtapadi </indig> <,> or Geetagovinda in the  
Kerala tradition <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#50:1:A>
So <,> <-> in </-> the actor is performing his action on the basis  
of <,> the <indig> wachikabhinaya </indig> performed by the composer the  
musician 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#51:1:A>
The main musician is called Ponani the second musician is called  
Sengadi <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#52:1:A>
Ponani and Sengadi with uh <,> instrumental <,,> music <,,> cymbals  
<,> <indig> chengala </indig> <,> or <indig> eluttalam </indig> <,> are being  
used by the singers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#53:1:A>
And on the basis of the <indig> wachikabhinaya </indig> <,> the  
actor <,> acts <,,> on the principle of <indig> padarthabhinaya </indig> and  
<indig> bhavatmaga </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#54:1:A>
He has the freedom to <,,> uh present his uh <,> quality and  
efficiency in <indig> manodharmatam </indig> or <indig> ilagiyatam </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#55:1:A>
While <,> in <indig> chuliyatam </indig> he actually imitates the  
words through expression and uh <,> conveying the meaning through the  
gestural language <,> just like <indig> pataka <,> mudra <,> kadagamughum <,>  
shukatundam <,> sarpashirsham uh <,> mrigashirsham </indig> <,> etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#56:1:A>
So <,> the gestural language is very important in <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> <,> as it is <,> important in Kudiattam also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#57:1:A>
But in Krishnanatam we don't find <,> so much employment of  
gestural language 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#58:1:A>
There the dance technique is more important <,> the <indig> nritya  
</indig> and <indig> nrita </indig> are important <,,> while in <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> <,> <indig> natya nrita nritya </indig> are also <,> uhm  
equally important <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#59:1:A>
The another aspect of <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,> we have to  
point out that we are seeing imitative action <,> we are seeing <,>  
descriptive action <,> we are finding symbolic action <,> in <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#60:1:A>
All these techniques are employed together in <mention> Kathakali  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#61:1:A>
Kathakali <,,> actor <,> will have to <,,> undergo <,> a training  
<,> a rigorous training for six or more years <,> under an able <indig> guru  
</indig> <,> to become a good actor <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#62:1:A>
Uh <,> and for that <,,> in Kerala <,> the <indig> gurukula  
</indig> system of coaching was <}> <-> <.> pre </.> </-> <=> prevalent </=>  
</}> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#63:1:A>
Now it is almost faded <,> and we are having certain institutions  
like Kerala Kalamandalam <,> instituted by <,> poet laureate <,> Wallatol <,>  
Narayan Menon <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#64:1:A>
He is the <,> chief personality <,> who <,> worked behind <,> the  
popularisation <,> the modern popularisation of <mention> Kathakali  
</mention> <,> in modern times <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#65:1:A>
The Kalamandalam <,,> Margi in Trivandrum <,> and some other  
institutions are also giving <,> training in this particular art form as well  
as it provides <,> training in <indig> kodiattam <,> mohiniyattam </indig>  
<,> uhn and other similar art forms of Kerala <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#66:1:A>
With regard to the literature of Kathakali <,> we are having about  
five hundred stories based on <,> the Puranas <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#67:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> Ka </.> </-> <=> Ramanatam </=> </}> of course <,,> is  
based on <,> Valmiki Ramayana <,> and uh <,> Kotechidambaran stories <,> <w>  
Unnai's </w> Nalacharitam <,> Iraimentam stories <,> are based on Mahabharata  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#68:1:A>
And similarly we are having <,> many stories <,> based on Ramayana  
<,> Mahabharata and <,> other Puranas <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#69:1:A>
Yet Dakshayagam is a very <,,> popular story <,,> connected with  
<,> Shiva <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#70:1:A>
Lord Shiva <,,> is punishing <,> his father-in-law <,> Daksha <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#71:1:A>
And a quarrel between <,,> father-in-law and son-in-law <,,> takes  
place <,,> in a very dramatic manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#72:1:A>
This <,> theme is adopted by <,,> a poet composer of eighteenth  
century <,> Iraimantambi <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#73:1:A>
Iraimantambi was <,> a musician <,> a musicologist <,> a <,>  
Kathakali composer <,> and uh <,,> a very good art connoisseur <,> who lived  
in the period of <indig> Shri </indig> Sadatinha Maharaja <,> who was the <,>  
doyen of Karnataka music as far as Kerala is concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#74:1:A>
And uh <,> Iraimantambi was a court musician <,> court poet <,> and  
uh <,> very popular figure in the cultural arena of Kerala of the ninteenth  
century <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#75:1:A>
Before that we have got <,> Unnai Wadiyar who composed  
Naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four <,> uhn days play <,,> uh based on  
Mahabharata <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#76:1:A>
The Nala Damayanti katha <,> is beautifully presented in the  
Nalacharitam <,> uh with musical skill <,> with literary skill <,> as well as  
sufficient scope to <,> action also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#77:1:A>
After that we can point out only this personality Iraimantambi <,,>  
uh for his three plays Keechakavadham <,> Uttaraswayavaram and Dakshayagam  
<,> uh very popular stories on the Kathakali stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#78:1:A>
Beyond that <,> we are having Ravana Vijayam by Tilimanur  
Vidwangoitambran <,> and uh <,> Duryodhanavadham <,> by Waikkarmusud <,> uh  
Tadagavadham by Weekasindambi who is the originator of the Kathakali club  
system in Kerala <,> uh who has uh written some Kathakali plays also <,,> uh  
modified some techniques <,> evolved some uh <,> evolutions in the <,,>  
methods on the Kathakali stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#79:1:A>
Uh similarly <,,> we are having some later period composers also  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#80:1:A>
For example one <,> man who lives till now <,,> Mali Madhavanna has  
composed a story on Karnashapatham <,> that is also based on <,> Mahabharata  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#81:1:A>
Modern writers <,> uh try to adopt foreign stories <,> in Kathakali  
stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#82:1:A>
For example Kerala Kalamandalam <,> presented this year <,> a story  
on the basis of <w> Shakespeare's </w> <mention> King Lear </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#83:1:A>
Uhn it was appreciated by <,> foreign audience but I don't know <,>  
whether <,> this will suit Kathakali <,> stage fully well as the mythological  
<,> themes of our <,> traditional <,> style <,> and we can not <,,> think of  
a <,,> a Shakespearean character <,> with this <indig> pachha </indig> or <,>  
other costumes <,> on the Kathakali stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#84:1:A>
Another <,> aspect <,,> we have to account <,> with regard to  
<mention> Kathakali </mention> is the musical <,> aspect of uh <,> this  
theatrical art <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#85:1:A>
We have got <,,> in Kerala <,> three major instruments of music <,>  
<indig> idakya <,,> chanda </indig> <,> and <indig> muyav </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#86:1:A>
<indig> Idakya </indig> is used for <,,> <indig> sopan </indig>  
music <,,> or <indig> ashtapadi </indig> singing <,> and uh <,> <indig> muyav  
</indig> is for <indig> chakyarkut </indig> and <,> <indig> kudiattam  
</indig> alone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#87:1:A>
While <indig> chanda </indig> <,> and <indig> maddalam </indig> <,>  
are used in Kathalali <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#88:1:A>
<indig> Idakya </indig> has got some relevance in <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> very rarely also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#89:1:A>
And this <}> <-> <.> chan </.> </-> <=> <indig> chanda </indig>  
</=> </}> and uh <,> <indig> maddalam <,> iluttalam </indig> <,> and <indig>  
kaimani </indig> <,> this combination of <mention> Kathakali </mention> in  
<,> musical aspect is very important <,> and just like <indig> aharyabhinava  
</indig> this musical instrument also gives <,> a very good impression on the  
whole art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#90:1:A>
<mention> Kathakali </mention> is a total theatre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#91:1:A>
It is dramatic <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#92:1:A>
It is musical <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#93:1:A>
It is rhythmic <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#94:1:A>
There is dance <,> technique there are <,> there is natya technique  
<,> there is nrita technique <,> everthing is combined in there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#95:1:A>
And the total story is being present <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#96:1:A>
Another <,> aspect of the story is <,> in <indig> kudiattam  
</indig> and <indig> kuttu </indig> we find <indig> vidushaka </indig>  
character <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#97:1:A>
But there is no <indig> vidushaka </indig> <,> or comic character  
in <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#98:1:A>
We are having <indig> dhirodatta <,> dhirodhadata <,> dhiralalita  
</indig> and <indig> dhirashanta </indig> <,> characters <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#99:1:A>
These characters are <.> ba </.> coming from <,> our Puranas and  
<,> uh Epics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#100:1:A>
So <,,> uh this type of <indig> nayaka </indig> characters <,> uh  
<,> heroines like <,> Damayanti <,,> or <,> Uttara <,> or Draupadi <,,> uh  
women characters they also <,,> uh participate in the action 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#101:1:A>
But the women characters <,,> uh are represented by men only <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#102:1:A>
Major actors are men <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#103:1:A>
They take the role of uh <,> female characters <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#104:1:A>
That is a peculiar <,,> uh aspect of <mention> Kathakali  
</mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#105:1:A>
There are very few <,> ladies <+> who </+> participate in  
<mention> Kathakali </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#106:1:A>
And there is a troupe also <,> ladies troupe also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#107:1:A>
But that is not so popular <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#108:1:A>
Mainly <,> the <-> main </-> men take female role also <,,>  
because uh <,> <mention> Kathakali </mention> requires <,,> very rigorous  
training in <,,> uh <indig> aangikabhinaya </indig> aspect <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#109:1:A>
Uh female <,,> dancers or actors do not <,> undergo such severe  
training <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#110:1:A>
Men only can face that uh <,> annual <,,> training <,> physical  
training <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#111:1:A>
So <,> <mention> kathakali </mention> <,,> is <,> a performance  
<,,> mainly acted by <,,> men <,,> and this is very popular <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#112:1:A>
This is <,,> almost a temple art <,> but it has come out of the  
temple walls <,> and <,> it is presented for social functions <,> cultural  
functions <,> and other <,,> uhn celebrations also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#113:1:A>
Every temple festival <,> will have a Kathakali performance <,>  
one or two or three or <,> any number <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#114:1:A>
Similarly <,> uh this <,,> costume makers <,,> the <,,>  
productions <,,> everything <,> of <.> Katha </.> every aspect of <mention>  
Kathakali </mention> has become <,> a predominant <,,> uh factor of our <}>  
<-> <.> K </.> </-> <=> Kerala </=> </}> culture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#115:1:A>
Just like <,> we had Krishnatam troupes in ancient times <,> we  
are having <,> Kathakali troupes <,> in modern times also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#116:1:A>
Uh it is <,,> almost <,> a non-secular performance now <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#117:1:A>
And we are having <,,> Kathakali <indig> pada kacharis </indig>  
now <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#118:1:A>
We are having individual presentations like <indig> putanamorcha  
</indig> or <,> some other story <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#119:1:A>
Individual characters are being presented 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#120:1:A>
Now we have got a <,> youth festival stage in Kerala <,> school  
youth festival and college youth festival <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#121:1:A>
There also <,> <-> uh there is </-> much competition is going on  
between youngsters to present <,> <mention> Kathakali </mention> in a  
beautiful way <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#122:1:A>

popularity <,> day by day <,> and Wallatol has contributed much for our <,>  
uh present popularity of <mention> Kathakali </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#123:1:A>
This classical theatre <,> is <,,> uh progressing <,> even though  
we have lost so many <,> uh distinguished actors <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-021#124:1:A>
The style of acting and the presentation of the art <,> the  
standard of art is maintained almost <,> in a very <,> uh attractive <,>  
method <,,>
