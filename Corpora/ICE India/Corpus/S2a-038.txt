<ICE-IND:S2A-038#1:1:A>
My name is Madhu Purohit 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#2:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> an Automobile Engineer <w> I've </w> done my <,>  
masters in Motor Vehicle Technology from Germany <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#3:1:A>
Uh <,,> I would like to talk about <,,> the <,,> topics <,> that are  
usually taught <,> in uh <,,> the Automobile Institutions <,,> like Poly  
Technique and even now some of the famous colleges like B V B college <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#4:1:A>
Uh they are adapting <,> Automobile Engineering as one of the  
subjects for Degree courses <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#5:1:A>
Uh <,,> <w> I'm </w> of the opinion that <,> the topics <,,> that  
these people use <,,> uh <,,> some of it is <,> basically wasted <,,> because  
they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#6:1:A>
Uh because <,,> they teach you so many things that are not directly  
connected to Automobile Engineering <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#7:1:A>
And in order to probably create <,,> or get the best type of quality  
of people that <,,> are there abroad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#8:1:A>
In order to get that type of people you have to really <,> have  
subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#9:1:A>
You know we have Electrical Engineer <,> or Mechanical Engineer <,,>  
who are taught uh <,,> the Production Engineering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#10:1:A>
And say <,,> in what way is production quality control <,,> okay he  
is going to be a design Engineer <,> his job is to design <,> not quality  
control 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#11:1:A>
It is upto each individual when he <,> produces that part <,> to  
see that the quality is alright <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#12:1:A>
But this guy <,> he wastes his time <,> studying production  
Engineering and quality control <,,> so many other things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#13:1:A>
I feel <,> that <,> in Germany <,> basically people are taught more  
direct <,,> pertaining to the subject <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#14:1:A>
Yes <,,> we were also taught <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#15:1:A>
Now <w> I'm </w> an Automobile Engineer <,,> along with Automobile  
technology we were also taught about Rocket Technology <,> Jet Engine <,> or  
say Gas Turbine <,> but we were not tested as such <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#16:1:A>
That was just given to us as a background <,> so that if somebody  
talks about Jet Engines or <,> Gas turbines or High Breed Engines <,,> we  
should know what he is talking about <w> that's </w> all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#17:1:A>
We need not have any special <,,> uh you know theoritical know-how  
and specification or any kind of thing like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#18:1:A>
So that made it only <,,> knowledgeable <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#19:1:A>
See we know of oh yes I know what Gas turbine is about <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#20:1:A>
I know what these things are about <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#21:1:A>
But basic thrust was on to our Automobile Engineering only <,>  
pertaining to those <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#22:1:A>
And that is what I was talking <,,> or rather telling these people  
that we should adapt <,> more of <,> that type of technology where in we can  
get better types of people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#23:1:A>
They need not then wait <,> for gathering experience in some  
Automobile Industry or whatever <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#24:1:A>
They need they could be immediately absorbed <,> <-> during their  
</-> for their work the type of work they want to <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#25:1:A>
While as now here <,> we have Automobile Engineers <,> or  
Mechanical Engineers they just taken in as Engineers <,> and they don't know  
much about practical aspects <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#26:1:A>
For that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects  
<,,> because what happens is <,,> uh the theory is so <.> res </.> so  
restricted to their own this thing <,> that they have <,> they don't know <,>  
here idea is the Institution <,,> place more emphasis on <,,> this type of  
<,,> uh <,,> retention power you have <,> not this concept <,> whether you  
know the concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#27:1:A>
They say <quote> Alright I give you these notes and you see that  
<,> you learn 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#28:1:A>
So and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same  
things what are in the notes <,,> you will fail probably </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#29:1:A>
And <,> this is the biggest drawback <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#30:1:A>
People are not given <,,> the <,,> time <,> and even the  
opportunity to express themselves the <,> way they want <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#31:1:A>
Now if I teach you something about <,,> one particular aspect <,> I  
teach you the principle behind it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#32:1:A>
Now if <,,> the principle is known <,,> you can always explain back  
phenomenon about that particular <,> principle to anybody <,> in any way you  
like <,> as long as you bring the gist of the subject <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#33:1:A>
And that is what you require <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#34:1:A>
Now I ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that <,>  
okay what do you understand by this 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#35:1:A>
Yes we had learnt it I do not know what it is <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#36:1:A>
See because they are lacking that definition <,,> because they have  
learnt it only as a definition <,> they have not learnt it as a theory <,> as  
<,> a concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#37:1:A>
And it is so shocking you know now people who came here <-> I was  
</-> <,,> I had the opportunity of giving a lecture <,> in K H K about four  
times <,,> and there was a course <,> for training the trainer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#38:1:A>
So those people who are already training other people <,> I had to  
go and <,,> give a talk <,> to them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#39:1:A>
And I asked them casually how you know you will talk about Engine  
<,> Four Stroke Engine <,> what is the Four Stroke Engine <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#40:1:A>
Can anyone of you <,,> tell me what a Four Stroke Engine is <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#41:1:A>
And <w> you'll </w> be surprised not a single man <,> was able to  
tell what a Four Stroke Engine <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#42:1:A>
And they are all Automobile Engineers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#43:1:A>
So what we lack is basics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#44:1:A>
People like to draw graphs <,> that is something <,> if you meet an  
Engineer he will suddenly draw a graph <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#45:1:A>
He says <quote> This is the talk and <,,> no power <,> graph this  
is this graph <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#46:1:A>
They are so much into this graphs and <,,> which is not necessary  
<,,> they should know what basics is </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#47:1:A>
Now we have <,> somebody selling Maruti eight hundred <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#48:1:A>
What is this eight hundred <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#49:1:A>
I don't know <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#50:1:A>
So this is what is required that we need to do it <,,> our people  
should be given basic idea about all these <,,> then you go into details fine  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#51:1:A>
When somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four  
stroke what is this all <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#52:1:A>
I should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about  
technical stuff <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#53:1:A>
If I can tell her what a Four Stroke Engine is and if she  
understands <,> that is the way you should teach somebody 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#54:1:A>
Because <,> all of them are novice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#55:1:A>
If you are teaching some technical student <,,> then I can afford  
to give them some kind of a technical definition <,,> because if I say  
<quote> For every <,,> two revolution there is one power stroke </quote> <,,>  
only a technician will understand probably what I am trying to say <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#56:1:A>
If <,,> you are a non technical person if I tell you this it will  
mean nothing to you <,,> and this is what this is what will happen to  
students <,,> if you tell them this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#57:1:A>
They only learn this what I have told them okay <,,> our teacher  
has given our lecturer has given this <,,> if I write this <w> I'll </w> get  
full marks <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#58:1:A>
Now this is bad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#59:1:A>
What we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#60:1:A>
So the <,> subjects also that are <,,> chosen <,> should be related  
directly related to the subject 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#61:1:A>
There are <,> thing that the students are <,> may be Mechanical  
Engineering Electrical Engineering <,> or Design Engineering whatever <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#62:1:A>
So it is very important that we also <,> have those kind of subject  
in oriental <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#63:1:A>
Then we have <,,> some people say <quote> What is the <,,> you know  
<,> future for an Automobile Engineer </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#64:1:A>
You see we are looked down upon <,> by the society at large <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#65:1:A>
Yeah I do not know really <w> I'm </w> also puzzled now how to  
really change this thinking <,> because people <,> here <,,> <.> basica </.>  
<,> especially in <,,> small cities like Dharwad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#66:1:A>
When somebody says Automobile Engineer <,> they really <,> don't  
know much about it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#67:1:A>
And then they feel <,> okay Automobile Engineer means <,,> somebody  
who does not have <,,> brains up there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#68:1:A>
Somebody who is not fit for anything <,> or any other profession he  
has to be an Automobile Engineer <,> this is the understanding <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#69:1:A>
And how wrong <,> they are because now the Automobile field is  
becoming so sophisticated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#70:1:A>
Unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our Automobile  
field here in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#71:1:A>
But <,,> with <,,> the <,> finance <+> minister </+> <,,> uh <,,>  
Man Mohan Singh <,> plans you know for reducing tax or <,> you know giving  
free <,,> trade uh <,> facilities to our business people <,> probably we are  
getting in some new technology <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#72:1:A>
And with the help of these <.> tech </.> these these newer  
technologies <,> the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary  
man <,> who used to think okay this is my thing <,> you know that set up  
something on the roadside and do it <,,> he will be absolutely nowhere  
because he will not know what to do with these <,> vehicles <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#73:1:A>
And only a person who has educational or <,,> lot of <,,> an  
intellectual person with educational background <,,> in that particular field  
will be able to tackle this job <,,> henceforth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#74:1:A>
So <,> but it is so difficult to <,> tell <,,> now like you are  
there <,> or you are there <,> now to come and tell them <,,> look I don't  
mind marrying a guy who is an Automobile Engineer because <,,> he is also  
like a degree holder like any other guy <w> what's </w> wrong <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#75:1:A>
Okay he has to deal with car <,,> and he deals with some machine  
which you don't see <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#76:1:A>
But cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you  
know already preconceived <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#77:1:A>
When you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got  
no shoes they wear <indig> chappals </indig> <,> some torn shirts and all  
that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom <,> that is the  
picture you have <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#78:1:A>
And the moment you think of an Automobile Engineer uh this fellow  
also must be exactly like that <,> and I don't want to marry this guy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#79:1:A>
So this stigma we have to <,> <O> one word </O> it you know <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#80:1:A>
There is a vast difference <,,> between a guy who has done his  
Diploma <,> and would like to work as an Automobile Engineer <,> than <,,>  
the guy who is working on the roadside <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#81:1:A>
So the social stigma has to be of course <,> like they say <quote>  
Charity begins at home </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#82:1:A>
We have <}> <-> a </-> <+> to </+> </}> start from home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#83:1:A>
Take my parent when I got married I told my parents look okay you  
don't tell the girl <,,> what my qualifications <,> tell her what <w> I'm  
</w> doing exactly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#84:1:A>
Because I don't want her to get a shock because when I got married  
I was in Australia <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#85:1:A>
I had come here only to get married <,,> and she was in Bombay and  
all that and I had to tell her parents and her <,> that look I work on cars I  
literally I am <,> underneath <,> and I do get filthy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#86:1:A>
Because I don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have  
done your Masters and all I had thought you would be sitting in some cabin  
somewhere and <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#87:1:A>
Nothing of that kind because <,> this is what happens 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#88:1:A>
Basically people tell <,> something <,,> and <,,> there are some  
<,,> you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then I don't  
want <,> her to repent <,> her parents to repent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#89:1:A>
Things should be very clear <,,> but <,,> like I say <quote> We  
should start from home </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#90:1:A>
My parents <,> okay they know exactly what I have done where I  
stand and what I do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#91:1:A>
That is what each person should start telling his parents <,> and  
his friends <,,> because this is the only way <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#92:1:A>
If I meet somebody directly and I tell them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#93:1:A>
Look <,> it will not appeal to them <,> it has to start from home 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#94:1:A>
You know <w> you've </w> got better ideas coming from home <,> you  
rather do things that your parents tell you <,,> instead of taking or making  
your own choice and saying <,> <quote> I don't care what you think I like to  
marry this guy because he is an Automobile Engineer </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#95:1:A>
No this will never work <,,> because we are so <,,> you know far  
behind still in these aspects <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#96:1:A>
And <,,> that is why <,> to change peoples attitude and <,> you  
know it is very difficult <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#97:1:A>
Attitudes are <,> something <,> you can't change <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#98:1:A>
That is what I am trying here in my workshop now <,,> to change  
attitudes <,> their thinking <,> of regular maintainance about cars <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#99:1:A>
They think <,> service means just wash and grease and finish <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#100:1:A>
Those people who come here with that intention in their mind I  
just send them away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#101:1:A>
I just don't entertain them <,> because this is not a place only  
to wash and grease 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#102:1:A>
I have got diploma people here working <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#103:1:A>
I would like to utilise <,> them to utilise their know-how <,> and  
tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in <,> you  
know washing and greasing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#104:1:A>
I say <quote> Why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there  
is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that </quote>  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#105:1:A>
But they don't have that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#106:1:A>
Here we believe <,> our Indian people believe in <,,> breakdown  
maintainance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#107:1:A>
Until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day  
if it <,> breaks down on you then you think oh I should go to a workshop now  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#108:1:A>
There is no such thing called as preventive maintainance <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#109:1:A>
That preventive maintainance is <,> yes it is expensive <,,> and  
we do change <,> or throw away parts which are still slightly good <,>  
otherwise they would have run <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#110:1:A>
Then people say <,,> <quote> Why do you throw that <,> it is still  
okay </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#111:1:A>
So preventive maintainance <,,> yes if you want <,> the down time  
to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be <,,> you know <,>  
parked in the <.> ga </.> workshop for a long time because of non  
availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-038#112:1:A>
Now <w> it's </w> totally broken so you have to wait <,,> </I>
