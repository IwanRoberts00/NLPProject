<bold> The attempts to define infinity - - from Zeno to <&> centered

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#3:1>
The infinite: No other question has ever moved so profoundly the
spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet
no other concept stands in greater need of clarification than that of the
infinite <*> dotted line</*> </it> </p> <&> right justification </&> - -
DAVID HILBERT </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> MANY </smallcaps> </bold> laymen regard infinity
as a kind of number larger than all numbers, but infinity is not a number at
all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#5:1>
It is a <it> concept, </it> the name of which is derived from the
Latin word <it> <foreign> infinitus </foreign> </it> meaning without limit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#6:1>
It would not be an exaggeration to state that mathematics cannot
exist without the notion of infinity, because one comes across the
infinite in mathematics at almost every turn; there are infinite natural
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 <*> dotted line</*>, there is an infinity of fractions
between any two integers such as 0 and 1; numbers like 1/3, <*> square-root
</*> <&> under word </&> 2 and <*> pie </*> have an infinite decimal
expansion; there is an infinity of geometrical points in any line,
straight or curved, and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#7:1>
As the great German mathematician, David Hilbert ( 1862-1943)
rightly put it, <quote> " Mathematics is the science of infinity."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#8:1>
The story of infinity begins with the ancient Greeks, who were
among the first to recognize infinity as a central issue in mathematics and
to study its mysteries.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#9:1>
It is a story of many fascinating paradoxes and seemingly absurd
situations which have baffled mathematicians for well over 2,000 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#10:1>
With their penchant for logical rigour, the ancient Greeks naturally
had a deep-rooted suspicion of the infinite and tried to avoid its use at
any cost, thereby hindering the development of mathematics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#11:1>
Under the influence of Greek thought, infinity was for a long time
regarded as the <it> <foreign> enfant terrible </foreign> </it> of
mathematics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#12:1>
Even the great Galileo suggested banning its use in <O> column number
two drawing </O> mathematical discourse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#13:1>
The ancient <w> Greeks' </w> fear of infinity was prompted to a
large extent by the famous paradoxes of Zeno, a Greek philosopher who lived
in Elea in the fifth century BC and who is said to have been instructor to
Socrates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#14:1>
Zeno was investigating the question as to whether finite magnitudes (
of distance and time) are infinitely divisible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#15:1>
He attempted to show that they are not, as otherwise all motion would
be impossible! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#16:1>
In his first paradox, known as the paradox of the runner, Zeno
argued that in order for a runner to move from one place to another, say, 1
km away, he must first cover half the distance between the two places, then
half of the remaining distance, then half of what remains next, and so on (
Fig.1).

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#17:1>
If we assume that distance could be infinitely subdivided, then
this halving process continues <it> <foreign> ad infinitum </foreign> </it>
because, regardless of how little distance remains to be crossed, it can
still be halved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#18:1>
The distance in kilometres to be covered by the runner may be
represented by the sum of an infinite series ( 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 +
1/32 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#19:1>
Since this would require an infinite number of steps, Zeno argued
that the winner would never reach his destination!

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#20:1>
He may get arbitrarily close but he would never really get there.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#21:1>
Worse, it would seem that the runner cannot even begin!

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#22:1>
Employing a similar argument, it is seen that to go from one place to
another, the runner must first cover half the distance, to go half the
distance, he must first go one-fourth; to go one-fourth he must first go
one-eighth and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#23:1>
Again, the halves from an infinite sequence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#24:1>
So how does he get started? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#25:1>
In <w> Zeno's </w> second paradox, known as the paradox of
Achilles and the tortoise, the swift-footed Achilles races the slow-moving
tortoise, giving the latter a head start of 100 m.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#26:1>
If we suppose that Achilles can run 10 times as fast as the
tortoise, then by the time Achilles covers 100 m, the tortoise would have
moved forward by 10 m.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#27:1>
By the time Achilles covers 10 m, the tortoise is 1 m further on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#28:1>
By the time Achilles covers this 1 m, the tortoise is 1/10 m ahead,
and so on ( Fig.2).

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#29:1>
( We are again assuming here that distance can be infinitely
sub-divided.)

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#30:1>
The distance Achilles must travel to be level with the tortoise is
given by the sum of the infinite series ( 100 + 10 + 1 + 1/10 <*> dotted
line</*> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#31:1>
The <w> paradox's </w> conclusion is that Achilles will never be able
to catch up with the tortoise; always during the time it takes Achilles <O>
<&> page </&> 19 </O> to reach its last position, the tortoise would have
edged a little forward. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#32:1>
Of course, Zeno knew fully well that both these conclusions were
absurd, but if one followed his line of argument, the conclusions seemed
inescapable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#33:1>
Should we therefore infer that space and time are not infinitely
divisible and that an indivisible unit, an <quote> ` atom' </quote> of space
or time, would ultimately be reached?

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#34:1>
<w> Zeno's </w> other two paradoxes, namely, the paradox of the arrow
and the paradox of the stadium, also state that space and time can only be
subdivided a definite amount.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#35:1>
Thus the four paradoxes, taken together, seemed to show that space
and time are neither continuous nor discrete.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#36:1>
Obviously, something was wrong somewhere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#37:1>
<w> Zeno's </w> paradoxes had to wait another 20 centuries
before they could be resolved, which was possible only with the formulation
of the concept of the <quote > ` limit' </quote> of a convergent infinite <O>
Fig.1 </O> <O> caption </O> series.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#38:1>
Simply because a series has an infinite number of terms, it does not
mean that its sum must always be infinite.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#39:1>
It is possible for certain types of infinite series to converge to a
finite limit or sum - - a fact which the ancient Greeks did not accept.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#40:1>
Once this fact is accepted, we can assume space and time to be
infinitely divisible and the resulting paradoxes can be easily explained
away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#41:1>
For example, the infinite series ( 100 + 10 + 1 + 1/10 + <*>
dotted line</*> ) which appeared in <w> Zeno's </w> paradox of Achilles and
the tortoise, is known to converge to the limit 111.1111 <*> dotted line</*>
or 111 1/9; that is, as the number of added terms increases to infinity, the
sum of the series approaches 1/9 as its limit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#42:1>
The paradox is therefore resolved by observing that Achilles will
overtake the tortoise after he has covered a distance of exactly 111 1/9 m
from his starting point. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#43:1>
The resolution of <w> Zeno's </w> paradox of the runner is a
little more subtle.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#44:1>
Stating that the runner will never reach his destination amounts
to saying that he will take <it> infinite </it> time to cover the
distance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#45:1>
So, to resolve the paradox we have to simply show that the runner
will reach the end-point after a <it> finite lapse of time </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#46:1>
Now, the series ( 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + <*> dotted line</*> ) ,
representing the distance to be covered by the runner, is known to converge
to the limit 1.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#47:1>
If we assume that the runner maintains a steady speed, the time
intervals it takes him to cover these distances will also follow the
same series and will converge to a finite limit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#48:1>
In other words, the runner will cover the entire distance in a finite
span of time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#49:1>
( It must be borne in mind that many infinite series diverge, the
simplest example being the sum of all natural numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + <*>
dotted line</*> ) . </p> <O> Figure </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#50:1>
If the concept of limit of infinite series helped resolve one set
of paradoxes, it posed new ones - - paradoxes which puzzled mathematicians
of the 17th and 18th centuries in much the same way as <w> Zeno's </w>
paradoxes had puzzled Greek philosophers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#51:1>
Consider, for example, the Grandi series 1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 + <*> dotted
line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#52:1>
Representing the series as S, we may write :

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#53:1>
S = ( 1-1) + ( 1-1) + ( 1-1) + <*> dotted line</*> = 0 + 0 + 0 + <*>
dotted line</*> = 0

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#54:1>
But we can also represent S as, S = 1 + ( - 1+1) + ( - 1+1) + ( -
1+1) + <*> dotted line</*> = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 <*> dotted line</*> = 1 </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#55:1>
Grandi discovered this series in 1703 and claimed that God must
have used a technique based on this series in order to create something from
nothing, and got the world going. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#56:1>
It is possible to manipulate the Grandi series yet another way :

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#57:1>
S = 1 - ( 1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 + <*> dotted line</*> ) = 1-S

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#58:1>
Therefore, 2S = 1, or S = 1/2. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#59:1>
Which is the real limit of the Grandi series: 0, 1 or 1/2 ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#60:1>
Surprisingly, none of these is the answer, for the Grandi series does
not converge at all; it is a divergent series. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#61:1>
Consider the infinite series of the reciprocals of natural
numbers, with the signs alternating.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#62:1>
It is known to converge to the natural logarithm of 2 ( written in
2 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#63:1>
1/1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + 1/7 - 1/8 + <*> dotted line</*> =
In 2

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#64:1>
If we multiply both sides of this equation by 1/2, we get: 1/2 -
1/4 + 1/6 - 1/8 + <*> dotted line</*> = 1/2 In 2 <O> fig.2 </O> <O> caption
</O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#65:1>
We now add the two series, term by term vertically.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#66:1>
1/1 + 1/3 - 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/7 - 1/4 + <*> dotted line</*> = 3/2 In 2

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#67:1>
The last series is simply a rearrangement of the first, yet
its sum is 3/2 of the sum of the original series! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#68:1>
Now, in our ordinary finite calculations, rearrangement of the
order of the terms does not affect the value of the sum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#69:1>
Thus 1+2+3 = 2+1+3 = 3+2+1.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#70:1>
Shouldn't this rule apply to the sum of an infinite number of terms
as well?

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#71:1>
Our intuition seems to say yes, but then it would lead to the absurd
result 1= 3/2.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#72:1>
We must, therefore, conclude that the two infinite sereis are not the
same and that in respect of an infinite series, rearrangement of the terms
may <O> <&> page </&> 20 </O> sometimes alter the sum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#73:1>
We get the first hint here that the ordinary rules of
arithmetic, always valid for finite calculations, may break down in the realm
of the infinite.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#74:1>
In an infinite series, rearrangement of the terms may, under certain
conditions, not only affect the limit to which the series converges, it may
even change a convergent series into a divergent one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#75:1>
The man who succeeded in taming the mathematical monster of
infinity and in placing it on a sound logical footing was the Russian-born
German mathematician Georg Cantor ( 1845-1918 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#76:1>
In a series of highly original papers published between 1874 and
1897, Cantor laid the foundations of a new <quote> ` arithmetic of infinity'
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#77:1>
His results were based on two very simple concepts; that of a set
and a one-to-one correspondence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#78:1>
Until <w> Cantor's </w> time, mathematicians held the view that
the infinite had only a potential existence and that there was no actual ( or
completed) infinite.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#79:1>
For example, mathematicians would say that the collection of natural
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, <*> dotted line</*> is potentially infinite because
every number can be succeeded by an even larger number, but they would
deny that the collection is actually infinite since it does not exist as one
finished thing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#80:1>
Cantor made a departure from this well established view by accepting
the actual infinite as a full-fledged mathematical entity and by insisting
that infinite aggregates must be regarded as a <it> totality </it> , as an
object which our mind should conceive of as a whole.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#81:1>
His concept of a set, and of an infinite set in particular, came in
handy in this regard. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#82:1>
What is a set?

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#83:1>
A set is any collection of objects, physical or mathematical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#84:1>
Cantor himself defined a set as <quote> " a many which allows itself
to be regarded as a one." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#85:1>
Sets may be either finite ( like the set of letters of the English
alphabet ) or infinite ( like the set of all natural numbers, the set of all
points on a given line etc. ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#86:1>
A subset is any collection of elements taken from the original
set and regarded as a new set.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#87:1>
Thus the set ( a, b, c, d ) is a subset of the set of the letters of
the English alphabet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#88:1>
Similarly, the set of all even numbers and the set of all prime
numbers are subsets of the set of all natural numbers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#89:1>
The cocnept of a cardinal number is basic to the theory of sets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#90:1>
It is a measure of the size of a set, that is, the number of elements
a set contains.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#91:1>
For example, the cardinal of the set S = ( a, b, c, d ) is 4.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#92:1>
How do we specify the cardinal of an infinite set?

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#93:1>
For this, we would need an infinite number. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#94:1>
Cantor employed the concept of a one-to-one correspondence to
find out whether two sets, finite or infinite, are of the same size or
different.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#95:1>
It is not necessary, he said, that we should be able to <it> count
</it> the number of elements in two different sets in order to say which set
is larger.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#96:1>
( Of course, in case of infinite sets such counting is
impossible.)

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#97:1>
We can simply match the elements of the two sets on a one-to-one
basis; if there is an exact matching, we say that the two sets are equivalent
or have the same cardinal; if, however, such an exact matching is not
possible, and in one of the sets some unpaired elements are left, we
say that this set is larger ( that is, it has a bigger cardinal) than the
other. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-021#98:1>
Now, there was nothing new about the principle of 1:1 matching.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#99:1>
Both Galileo and the 17th century German scholar Leibnitz had
employed it about two centuries earlier and they had <O> table </O> <O> <it>
Fig. 3 The hierarchy of infinities; <*> undesiphered figure </*> <C  <F  </O>
arrived at the <quote> ` absurd' </quote> conclusion that the infinity of
natural numbers is just as large as the infinity of perfect squares or the
infinity of even numbers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#100:1>
Cantor first set about resolving these two paradoxes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#101:1>
He made the bold assertion that since an infinite set can be matched
with its own subset on a 1:1 basis, the two are in fact equal, and if this
result contradicts the maxim, <quote> ` the whole is greater than the part'
</quote> , then the fault lies only with the maxim.

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#102:1>
This maxim, Cantor said, is true of finite sets only; in the world
of the infinite <quote> ` a part is equal to the whole' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#103:1>
In fact, he seized upon this strange property as the definition of
an infinite set: <quote> ` A set S is said to be infinite if it can be
matched one to one with a subset of itself; in the contrary case, S is said
to be finite.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#104:1>
Here the infinite is defined positively, and it is the finite set
that is characterized negatively ( as one that is not infinite ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-021#105:1>
Thus Cantor made a virtue out of what Galileo and Leibnitz regarded
as a vice. </p> </I>
