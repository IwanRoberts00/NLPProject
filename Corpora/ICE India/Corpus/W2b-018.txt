By J.D. SETHI </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ONE </smallcaps> </bold> is bound to be taken
aback by the simple fact that every book or report about the Indian education
system written over the last three decades speaks - - and speaks rather
loudly - - on the one hand about the crisis of higher education and, on the
other, its massive achievement in producing a vast army of scientific and
technical manpower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#5:1>
Of course, numerous problems and contradictions bedevilled the
system at the time of Independence, but how we let them continue - - if we
did not actually ignore them - - while expanding education at all levels
all along the line remains a mystery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#6:1>
A few have analysed the problem as a crisis of expansion and
development in the sense of a transaction to a new, higher form of
educational organization, but they have failed to explain the transition.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#7:1>
The word <mention> crisis </mention> has been used more in the
pathological sense, not to be resolved but to be administered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#8:1>
Sectional educational reforms have been suggested to meet the
sectorial crisis but not the crisis of the system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#9:1>
Three main reports produced negative effects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#10:1>
<mention> The Radhakrishnan </mention> Report ( 1948) belonged to
some other world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#11:1>
<mention> The Kothari </mention> Commission ( 1964-66), in its
attempts to be all-comprehensive, generated many new distortions
without dealing with any of the prevailing ones effectively.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#12:1>
The 1988 <mention> New Education Policy </mention> is neither new nor
a policy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#13:1>
It is a document of and for bureaucrats and their masters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#14:1>
The Indian education system is overloaded with too many
objectives and every objective is considered equally important.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#15:1>
There are no serious priorities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#16:1>
Therefore, it is not feasible to find or establish an optimum or
normative relationship between education and any other social or economic
variable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#17:1>
No longitudinal analysis is feasible because of sampling
difficulties.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#18:1>
Even to ask a student a simple question about the purpose for which
he is pursuing education is not easily answered as motives remain mixed
and perspectives blurred. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#19:1>
This phenomenon does not apply to education only.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#20:1>
The same thing has happened to our Five-Year Plan documents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#21:1>
From one Plan to the next, the list of objectives and priorities
has become so long and their internal inconsistences so damaging that the
Planning Commission has only brought ridicule on itself. </p> <&> centered
</&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#22:1>
<h> <bold> UTTER CONFUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#23:1>
In fact, it may not be surprising if one finds that the number
of crisis the system is facing is more or less the same as the number of
objectives with which the system is loaded or the contradictions which are
created by the conflicting objectives.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#24:1>
If one finds utter confusion in educational analysis it is not
because the analysis alone is faulty the elite perceptions and their skewed
preferences do not permit any logical, let alone fruitful, analysis,
certainly not in forms that other nations make use of or our great
educational thinkers of the pre-Independence era, like Tagore, Sri Aurobindo
and Mahatma Gandhi, adopted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#25:1>
More specifically, as the difficulties of adjustment between
the education system and the demands made upon it pile up, structural
maladjustments, a blurring of perspective overloading of the system, the
difficulties of drawing the balance-sheet between success and failure,
become insurmountable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#26:1>
Excellence matched by rewards and degeneration that is not matched by
punishment, a distinction that must be drawn between growth and
quality, distrust and manipulation of the examination system, <}> <->
declaring </-> <+> declining </+> </}> standards of teaching, and the
irrelevance of research and a host of other issues connected with higher
education defy rational judgment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#27:1>
Commissions, committees, advisory councils, academic bodies,
etc., have all gone into these questions again and again.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#28:1>
Partial solutions were suggested and even implemented, but the system
merrily went on from difficulty to difficulty, from crisis to crisis, and yet
the problems kept growing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#29:1>
The term <mention> crisis </mention> has now become an
understatement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#30:1>
Those who did not speak of a crisis also believed that though
education had expanded as an instrument of upward mobility, <O> edirorial
comment belove </O> there was something seriously wrong with it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#31:1>
The more common refrain was that of stagnation and the gap
betwen educational expansion and the needs of society, the economy and the
polity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#32:1>
The result was that whoever produced any document or policy
statement on education injected his own ill-digested ideas and prejudices
into the corpus of motley views already existed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#33:1>
The theoretical content of education was overloaded with the result
that both the young and the old are completely bewildered about the real
purpose of education. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#34:1>
<h> <bold> ANALYTICAL POWER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#35:1>
We are told that the aim of education is to impart reading and
writing skills, and to train the analytical faculties of a child; to equip
him mentally so that he can make independent judgments about problems and
issues; to learn the techniques of sophisticated analysis; to prepare
youth to be strong and competitive in a world of severe competition; to
be a good citizen; to get a chance to lead the nation; to preserve and enrich
Indian traditions; to absorb the challenges of modernity; to balance value
with the need to promote science and to create technical and competent
manpower; to contribute towards economic development; to generate a new
sense of social commitment; to imbibe all those values which the education
systems of the world think worth pursuing; and finally to help India find
its place in the world of educated people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#36:1>
Nothing seems to have been left out.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#37:1>
There was no time-frame for any objective, nor was there a tag on
priorities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#38:1>
As the system became overloaded, it became hopelessly out of touch
with current needs and reality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#39:1>
It developed numerous contradictions and in the end became its
own antithesis, for one objective violated some other.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#40:1>
The system explicitly and self-consciously operated on a series of
contradictions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#41:1>
Sometimes, even pairs of contradictory concepts or objectives were
not recognized as contradictions but were put forward in the form of, on
the one hand, <quote> " this" </quote> and, on the other <quote> " that"
</quote> assuming that concepts could be simultaneously operationalised.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#42:1>
This has always been the way of all colonized intellectuals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#43:1>
After World War II numerous pressures were exerted on Third World
nations like India to accept dependence by becoming inter-dependent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#44:1>
Some of these pressures were ideological competitiveness, the
military or geopolitical considerations of big powers to keep the largest
areas and nations in their spheres of influence, technological
compulsions, trade and aid, and cultural and intellectual pressure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#45:1>
The weaker the nations, the less successful were they in resisting
capitulation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#46:1>
Our efforts to become self-relient, remain non-aligned and
strengthen the forces of national integration and political legitimacy
have not been very successful, partly because we were ruled by an elite
that accepted the superiority of the West and was incapable of resolving
contradictions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#47:1>
Although it was often said that political decolonization and
independence have to be accompanied by economic independence, the
same was not said, or said with equal force, about economic decolonization.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#48:1>
Indeed, the political and the educated elite created during
colonialism considered academic decolonization a non-issue and even
positively harmful to what was called <quote> " the development of an
international horizon" </quote> , or <quote> " technical excellence" </quote>
, or the needs of <quote> " modernization" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#49:1>
In 1947 there were two major streams of thought and policy
framework that could have influenced education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#50:1>
The first was Gandhian in which the dismantling of colonial
education was of paramount importance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#51:1>
During the Independence struggle, Gandhi not merely denounced the
education system introduced by the British; for the purpose of the national
struggle he started a parallel system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#52:1>
He was aware of the danger of cultural colonization remaining
after the British were gone.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#53:1>
Since higher education was to be the pinnacle of the new cultural
system and the creator of the new elite, it was natural that a dependent
pinnacle would produce a dependent elite having an international horizon
that served the capitalist neo-colonial or Communist-imperialist elite.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#54:1>
The other was <w> Nehru's </w> imitation model.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#55:1>
He thought it best to retain the colonial system and use it for the
new modernization.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#56:1>
But he made two serious mistakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#57:1>
First, against <w> Gandhi's </w> advice he made Maulana Azad the
Education Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#58:1>
The Maulana was a one-sided scholar.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#59:1>
Admittedly, he was conscious of the damage done to Indian society
by the British colonial system of education, but he stopped at that.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#60:1>
Occasionally, he made some very telling and perceptive remarks about
different issues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#61:1>
Some of his speeches in Parliament and the Constituent Assembly
were incisive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#62:1>
But his words and ideas never added up to a new model, a new
perspective or a new <}> <-> thurst </-> <+> thrust </+> </}> for national
education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#63:1>
Surprisingly, he and Nehru differed on vital issues but <w> Nehru's
</w> views prevailed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#64:1>
Maulana Azad slipped into total unconcern. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#65:1>
<h> <bold> <w> NEHRU'S </w> FAILURE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#66:1>
Secondly, Nehru failed to generate a movement for mass
education through which he could have undermined the colonial elite
domination of our education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#67:1>
He was more autobiographical than critical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#68:1>
The entire burden of change fell on higher education which it could
not bear as the system produced imitators rather than producers of knowledge.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#69:1>
How does one reduce the load on the system?

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#70:1>
It is easier said than done.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#71:1>
The critical change required is for the state to give up the
financial and academic responsibility for providing higher education to
anyone except these who are poor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#72:1>
Those who can pay must pay on the principle of full cost pricing or
some income criteria.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#73:1>
Even in a nation as rich as the USA, 54 per cent of those who receive
education pay for it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#74:1>
There is no hope of any reform in our system unless the poor stop
paying for the education of the rich and the middle classses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#75:1>

looks the other way on seeing a child who begs?

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#81:2>
Or who thrusts a coin indifferently in his palm just to get rid of
him?

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#82:2>
You probably take comfort in the knowledge that you are not
alone; most people shun street children.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#83:2>
But what would happen if you didn't turn away? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#84:2>
There are several who did - - and found themselves transformed
by the experience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#85:2>
One day in 1962, B B Singh, while waiting at a traffic light in
Mahim, Bombay, met Ramesh, a begger-child.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#86:2>
On an impulse Singh put a proposition before Ramesh - - he would
employ Ramesh as domestic provided the boy attended school, Ramesh agreed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#87:2>
From that day, he cleaned and kept house for the Singhs, then
attended a municipal school.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#88:2>
He did not appear to like school but Singh and his wife were firm.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#89:2>
Then one day, Ramesh left and never came back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#90:2>
The Singhs, disappointed but still resolute, waited for another
child they could help - - and found Keshav.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#91:2>
For eight years, they showered their affection on the orphan from
Uttar Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#92:2>
They were overjoyed when Keshav matriculated and found a good job.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#93:2>
Then the Singhs went abroad for two years and Keshav moved out of
their house.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#94:2>
When they returned after two years they were told that <w> Keshav's
</w> body had been found floating in a well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#95:2>
<w> Keshav's </w> friends attribute the death to <w> Keshav's </w>
terrible depression at being separated from the Singhs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#96:2>
Unable to cope with his grief, he had probably committed suicide.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#97:2>
The Singhs, heartbroken, vowed never to love another child so
much, but their lives were not to remain untouched by a <w> child's </w> for
long. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#98:2>
Today Singh and his wife continue to provide a better life to
underprivileged children.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#99:2>
At the moment they are searching for a suitable groom for Venu, who
has been with them for some years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#100:2>
She has completed a three-year training course in teaching
tailoring, cutting and embroidering, and currently runs her own boutique.

M V Anil discovered a 12-year-old beggar-child at a bus-stop one
day.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#102:2>
<indig> <it> Saab, ek rupaiya do.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#103:2>
Bhagwan aapka bhala karega </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#104:2>
<quote> " I decided to speak to the child," </quote> says Anil.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#105:2>
He told him that he would give him a <indig> rupee </indig> if he
would talk to him for a while.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#106:2>
The child agreed, though reluctantly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#107:2>
Anil learnt, with surprise, that Kishore, the beggar-child, also
earned some money washing cars.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#108:2>
His income went straight to his alcoholic father.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#109:2>
School was unaffordable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#110:2>
If Kishore wished to play video games or craved sweets like other
children, he had to beg for money, because asking his father usually meant a
thrashing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#111:2>
Anil gave Kishore the promised <indig> rupee </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#112:2>
Looking at the <w> child's </w> delighted face Anil wished he
could have given him something more useful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-018#113:2>
For 18-year-old Simi, an innocuous roadside conversation with
a dozen or so beggar-children eroded a few myths she had grown up with.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#114:2>
None of the children, Simi learnt, begged because they liked to.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#115:2>
They begged to support their families.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#116:2>
Like seven-year-old Sanjay whose alcoholic father did not have an
income.

<ICE-IND:W2B-018#117:2>

been taken for her <w> mother's </w> operation after she was injured in a
