<h> BOMBAY MUNICIPAL CORPORATION </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#2:1>
<h> Another surplus budget </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#3:1>
For the second consecutive year in two decades the Bombay
Municipal Corporation will have a surplus budget.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#4:1>
And unlike last year, there isn't even any proposal to hike taxes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#5:1>
So the BMC will continue to be the only municipal corporation in the
country that is rich enough to manage with its own resources. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#6:1>
The budget estimates for 1990-91, presented to the BMC standing
committee by the municipal commissioner, S.S. Tinaikar, on 31 January
shows a surplus of Rs. 32.48 <indig> lakhs </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#7:1>
The much-in-the-news octroi, which traders in Bombay are
pressurising the state government to abolish will contribute a whopping
Rs. 460 <indig> crore </indig> to the civic <w> body's </w> estimated income
of Rs. 655.95 <indig> crore </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#8:1>
<bold> Better collection. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#9:1>
Several measures taken by the civic administration, during the current
year ending 31 March, have helped the BMC open the next <w> year's </w>
revenue account with a balance of Rs. 11.15 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#10:1>
These measures include better collection of taxes and curtailing
the expenditure under several heads.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#11:1>
In the execution of some civic works, delays have slowed down the
outflow of funds during the current year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#12:1>
However, the <w> administration's </w> efforts at balancing the
budget, along with external factors which left the BMC with a surplus this
year has been beneficial to the Bombayite.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#13:1>
Citizens have been spared any increase in the existing rates of taxes
and fees and any new levies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#14:1>
The estimated revenue from general tax and fire tax for the next
year is down to Rs. 73 <indig> crore </indig> and Rs. 4.25 <indig> crore
</indig> , respectively, from this <w> year's </w> estimates of Rs. 76
<indig> crore </indig> and Rs. 4.50 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#15:1>
The revenue from wheel tax, however, is estimated to be the same as
that of the current year at Rs. 3.50 <indig> crore </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#16:1>
There has been a sharp decline in the estimated income from
licensing, from Rs. 24.97 <indig> crore </indig> this year, to Rs. 18.44
<indig> crore </indig> in the next year.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#17:1>
However, there is an increase in the estimated income from <w>
Bombay's </w> only abattoir and the municipal markets from Rs. 5.43
<indig> crore </indig> and Rs. 5.32 <indig> crore </indig> , respectively,
this year, to Rs. 5.50 <indig> crore </indig> and Rs. 5.62 <indig> crore
</indig> in the next year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#18:1>
<bold> Strident opposition. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#19:1>
Employee salaries continue to take up most of the revenue.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#20:1>
As much as 63 per cent of <w> BMC's </w> estimated expenditure of Rs.
666.86 <indig> crore </indig> , went under this head.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#21:1>
And with octroi making up the major chunk of the revenue income it is
not surprising that the municipal corporation employees union is
stridently opposing any move to abolish it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#22:1>
Under severe pressure from traders in Bombay, the state
government is actively considering abolishing it and replacing it with entry
tax.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#23:1>
Tinaikar, however, does not foresee octroi being abolished in the
near future.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#24:1>
<X> <quote> " The road transport <w> industry's </w> main complaint
was regarding long queues at octroi <indig> <it> nakas </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#X25:1>
The procedures have since been streamlined and vehicles do not have
to wait for more than 30 minutes," </quote> </X> he says.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#26:1>
But whether the tough minded Tinaikar, who is up for retirement this
year, manages to have his way, remains to be seen. </p>

<h> MRF LTD </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#29:2>
<h> Uneasy calm at Tiruvottiyur </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#30:2>
MRF Limited has entered a phase of reduced profit margins,
along with its competitors in the industry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#31:2>
For the six months ended September 1989, MRF recorded net sales of
Rs. 264.50 <indig> crore </indig> , with a gross profit of Rs. 11.98 <indig>
crore </indig> and a net profit of Rs. 5.10 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#32:2>
During April-September 1988, sales were Rs. 268.37 <indig> crore
</indig> , gross profit Rs. 22.80 <indig> crore </indig> , and net profit Rs.
11.38 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#33:2>
In addition to this, the labour situation at <w> MRF's </w>
Tiruvottiyur plant is taking a curious turn. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#34:2>
After a <w> year's </w> delay and protracted negotiations, the
union and the management signed a wage settlement on 19 January.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#35:2>
Described as <quote> " generous" </quote> by labour department
sources, the settlement resulted in an average wage increase of Rs. 465 per
worker.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#36:2>
But <w> Tiruvottiyur's </w> 1,100 strong workforce is not willing to
accept the production and productivity norms prescribed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#37:2>
The old norm of 2.350 tyres per day has now been increased to 2,700
tyres. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#38:2>
<bold> No mood to budge. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#39:2>
<quote> " While some resistance is inevitable in such instances,
Tiruvottiyur has never witnessed such united resistance," </quote> comments a
senior manager at MRF, who anticipates a confrontation at this plant.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#40:2>
<quote> " The workmen seem intent on testing the mood of the
management," </quote> he says. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#41:2>
Tension escalated with a stay-in-strike from 14 December 1989 to
19 January this year, when the settlement was finally hammered out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#42:2>
In the meanwhile, production losses amount to Rs. 42 <indig> lakh
</indig> per day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#43:2>
<bold> Tough stand </bold> The management is now clear that
<quote> " any settlement benefit will be paid only upon total implementation
of the terms of the settlement" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#44:2>
A. Soundarajan, vice-president of the union, belonging to CITU,
points out that it is impossible to achieve the norms from the first day of
operations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#45:2>
But MRF is now in a position to show its muscle.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#46:2>
It has learnt to deal with strikes and lock-outs from its Goa
experience.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#47:2>
It has also learnt to reschedule its production at its other three
plants in order to maintain its production value.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#48:2>
Thus the loss due to labour trouble will not have an impact on the
balance sheet.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#49:2>
The management is, therefore, keen on showing that it means
business. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#51:3>
<h> BONUS ISSUES </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#52:3>
<h> Inducing smaller dividends? </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#53:3>
In what seemed an obvious attempt to pep up the morale of the
secondary capital markets the government relaxed the bonus issue
guidelines on 23 January 1990.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#54:3>
As against the existing waiting periods of two years between two
succeeding bonus issues, companies will henceforth be alowed to issue
bonus shares after the lapse of one year from the preceding bonus issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#55:3>
The guideline, however, failed in any way to boost the sagging
spirits of the market.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#56:3>
Contrary to general expectations there was no euphoria greeting the
announcement.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#57:3>
The general opinion in the market was that except for a handful of
companies such as Procter and Gamble, Reckitt and Colman, Colgate and some
others, none of the others could really take advantage of this relaxation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#58:3>
As such few companies obliged their shareholders with bonus issues
every third year as per the existing guidelines while the wholly Indianised
companies tended to be rather conservative in their approach. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#59:3>
Investment analysts, however, agree that only multinational, FERA
and ex-FERA companies tended to benefit.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#60:3>
Liberal bonus issues enable companies to maximise repatriation of
profits, to their parent companies.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#61:3>
Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, healthcare, food and dairy products, tea
and lubricants were identified as some of the industries and companies
in these industries are traditionally generous in their dividend payments.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#62:3>
Besides facilitating higher dividend payouts, another unintended
benefit apparently passed on will result in considerable savings to the
non-resident shareholders of these companies.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#63:3>
Incidence of tax on dividend received by the non-residents is
nearly 54 per cent while the tax payable on long term capital gains is only
22 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#64:3>
As a result of this anomaly, companies in future will pay a
nominal dividend and issue bonus shares more frequently.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#65:3>
Foreign shareholders, by transferring their shares <foreign>
inter-se </foreign> can thus save on tax liabilities, without diluting their
holdings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#66:3>
A lower dividend outgo will also enable the corporate sector to
retain a higher amount of profits, at least in the short run period.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#67:3>
This is expected to ease, to some extent, borrowings from the banks
for working capital requirements. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#68:3>
From the <w> government's </w> view point an indirect inducement
to curb dividend outflows will result in lowering the surplus funds in the
hands of the investors, thereby curtailing the excess liquidity to some
extent. </p>

- - Six persons died while 25 others sustained injuries when the
truck in which they were travelling collided with another truck loaded with
coal this morning near the octroi post on Kamptee Road.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#74:4>
Of the injured the condition of three was stated to be serious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#75:4>
The mishap occurred at around 10 a.m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#76:4>
Koradi police which are investigating the matter said that the
persons, travelling in the truck were the workers of <indig> Shetkari
Sanghatana </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#77:4>
They were from five villages near Amravati. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#78:4>
The <indig> Sanghatana </indig> workers had come here to
participate in the public meeting to be addressed by Prime Minister, Mr. V.P
Singh at <indig> Deekshabhoomi </indig> this afternoon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#79:4>
One Hiraman of village Wathonda who was also travelling in the
truck said they came here from Amravati around 9.30 a.m. and as there was
enough time for the public meeting they decided to go to Ramtek to visit the
temple.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#80:4>
The plan was to return to the city before the public meeting.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#81:4>
Hiraman said there were around 60 to 70 workers in the truck (
MHV-7331).

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#82:4>
While nearing the octroi post, a coal loaded lorry ( MWY-4401) coming
from the opposite direction rammed into the Ramtek bound truck. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#83:4>
Hiraman said that the coal loaded truck ripped off one side of
their vehicle, due to which the persons sitting on that side were thrown out
of the truck. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#84:4>
Police said three persons namely Amal Sukhdev Bhare ( 20) of
village Dhilatpur, Krishnarao Annaji Langote ( 40) of Bhugaon and Mrs. Sheela
Nanuji Tatawade ( 40) of Wathonda died on the spot.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#85:4>

Madhukar Bhagwan Tasre ( 50) of Wathonda.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#92:4>
Dr. Kadasane said doctors attending on them made all possible efforts
to save them but in vain.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#93:4>
He said Ramkrishna who had multiple fractures on both the sides of
his rib-cage and also serious injuries on his chest died around 12.45 p.m.
while Madhukar passed away at around 2 p.m. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-013#94:4>

said and added that the other injured persons are responding to the
treatment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#96:4>
They all have sustained multiple injuries. </p>

Soon after the mishap the driver of the coal loaded truck ran
away from the spot.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#100:4>
However, late in the evening he himself came to the police station
and surrendered himself.

<ICE-IND:W2C-013#101:4>
