<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#3:1>
<bold> <it> The scope is no longer limited to AIR and <indig>
Doordarshan </indig> in electronic media.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#4:1>
With the entry of video newsmagazines and cable TV, there is growing
demand for creative, production and technical professionals. </it> </bold>
</p> </&> <&> columns </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#5:1>
<bold>I</bold>nformation - - the right to it may not be
recognised as fundamental in many countries, but not even the most tyrannical
of governments can suppress the human craving for it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#6:1>
With the rapid development of the electronic media
technology-communication satellites, cable networks, dish antennae, it is
becoming increasingly difficult for <quote> ` authority' </quote> to even
control <w> people's </w> access to information. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#7:1>
The electronic media comprises the audio or sound medium, namely
radio and the audio-visual medium of television.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#8:1>
Both steal a march over the printed word in that they can
instantaneously, or near instantaneously, transmit <quote> ` news'
</quote> all over the world simultaneously.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#9:1>
You can hear about or <quote> ` see' </quote> Sergei Bubka pole vault
to a new record; the Gulf War is brought <quote> ` live' </quote> to you,
courtesy CNN; you keep abreast of the latest poll results with Prannoy Roy
and Vinod Dua on Doordarshan.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#10:1>
You marvel at the technology that has made it possible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#11:1>
Perhaps, as the credits roll, you feel a sneaking desire to be out
there, not receiving but providing the information-gathering, compiling,
weaving the ingredients into a vibrant programme, creating the software
without which the most sophisticated equipment is equivalent to junk. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#12:1>
<h> <bold> A tough world </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#13:1>
A career in the electronic media can be interesting and exciting,
on the face of it, even glamorous; but in reality it is hard work in a tough
world - - a world in which dog eats dog calmly, firmly and unhesitatingly, a
world where you have to keep your wits about you to survive and run faster
and faster just to remain where you are.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#14:1>
The Indian scene has its own special difficulties.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#15:1>
All talk of autonomy, functional or otherwise, has so far led nowhere
and both radio and television are firmly under government control.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#16:1>
Quality is often at a discount, more so on <indig> Doordarshan
</indig> than on radio, as programming is guided by considerations other than
professionalism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#17:1>
Any attempt at free and fearless communication of ideas and
information is thwarted in the erroneous belief that it may hamper <quote> `
development' </quote> or <quote> ` social harmony' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#18:1>
Politicisation and bureaucratisation of the electronic media with
the attendant corruption, disregard for merit and rewards for sycophancy
have bred cynicism and despair in many who are still interested in
professional programming.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#19:1>
However, with the mushrooming of video newsmagazines and now cable
television, demand for software is beginning to go up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#20:1>
And in time quality and professionalism are bound to be the
guiding principles - - as they already are in some media organisations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#21:1>
The electronic media thus have a large potential for employment -
- part-time, full-time, freelance or working for a particular organisation.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#22:1>
<h> <bold> To get a foothold </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#23:1>
This field is one in which practical experience has as much value
as, if not more than, any formal training.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#24:1>
Even the courses that are offered at various institutions demand, as
a criterion for admission, <quote> ` definite evidence of acquaintance'
</quote> with some aspect of the media, be it photography, creative writing,
broadcasting, graphic art design or journalism in print.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#25:1>
It is clear that you must begin your association with the media at an
early age.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#26:1>
Indeed, many a successful freelancer today began his or her career
with the <w> children's </w> programmes on radio or television. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#27:1>
Mostly, however, the stepping stone in the audio media is the
<indig> Yuv Vani </indig> of All India Radio ( AIR).

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#28:1>
Similarly, on television, you may make your primary impact in the
youth programmes of <indig> Doordarshan </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#29:1>
All said and done, exposure on the official channels is invaluable to
further your career in the electronic media.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#30:1>
You must take the initiative in this manner: write or personally
apply to the producer in charge of the section, stating clearly your field of
interest, what you want to do, alongwith a brief bio-data.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#31:1>
Contrary to general opinion, you are seldom turned down out of hand,
unless you are blatantly below the required standard.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#32:1>
In the audio media you are required to pass a voice test or audition
if you want to present your programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#33:1>
On television, a pleasant personality is also called for.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#34:1>
However, even if you do not measure up to the demands of audition,
there are several areas behind the scenes where your talents can be utilised.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#35:1>
All the time you must assess your performance critically, never lose
an opportunity to pick up hints and valuable suggestions, and try to locate
the particular area in which you may excel.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#36:1>
Nor must you miss the opportunity to meet the right person who could
possibly give you an opening in the future, the right kind of break which
can take you way ahead of others in this field. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#37:1>
<h> <bold> Two mainstreams </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#38:1>
Programming in the electronic media involves in the main ( i)
Production and ( ii) Technical operations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#39:1>
In reality production inevitably includes technical operations, but a
peculiar distinction is made in that <quote> ` technical ops' </quote> is
considered as relating to those aspects in which actual use of machines is
involved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#40:1>
In all the fields, however, a creative approach is needed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#41:1>
The production side draws upon various talents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#42:1>
The Producer is in overall charge of a programme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#43:1>
He or she thinks of an idea, conceptualises the programme, chooses
the artists suitable for the subject, decides upon the format ( after
consulting media researchers if necessary), and coordinates the
translation of ideas and information into a programme suitable for the audio
or audiovisual medium, as the case may be.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#44:1>
Clearly the Producer must have a good knowledge of the demands,
advantages, limitations and impact of the particular medium he works for.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#45:1>
Making programmes for radio and television calls for different
approaches and talents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#46:1>
It is, of course, the top job as far as making a programme is
concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#47:1>
So far official policy has been to rec-ruit producers directly
or by promoting <O> <&> page </&> 39 </O> production assistants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#48:1>
Programme executives ( P Ex), as they are called, are inducted
through the UPSC on basis of administrative ability and subject
specialisation and then sent for a shortterm training session in
production skills.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#49:1>
It may be pointed out that for a long time formal training in this
field was not easily available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#50:1>
But now there are institutions offering courses in production.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#51:1>
Professionalism calls for intensive training in production skills
that can be attained from degree, diploma and certificate courses in mass
communication offered by select institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#52:1>
Freelancers specially benefit from these, as they not only learn the
basic techniques but also come into contact with production centres and
people in the media and thus job possibilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#53:1>
A Production <w> Assistant's </w> job includes contacting
talents, getting contracts cleared in official agencies, arranging for the
unit, transportation, studio requirements, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#54:1>
The official media recruits them directly, advertising for graduates
or even postgraduates, with knowledge of a regional language besides
English/Hindi, cultural traditions of India and the region, and production
sense, among other things.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#55:1>
In time they can be promoted to the <w> producer's </w> post.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#56:1>
There is plenty of opportunity to work on a casual basis in the
official media as well as in private production.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#57:1>
You have to take the initiative and send in your bio-data and
application to the stations and production centres for consideration and
inclusion on their <quote> ` panel' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#58:1>
Selection is on the basis of interview. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#59:1>
Any programme on radio or television requires a script and
screenplay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#60:1>
Writing for the electronic media, again, calls for a special
approach.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#61:1>
Formal training helps in effective writing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#62:1>
Openings on casual basis exist in abundance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#63:1>
The electronic media also calls for researchers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#64:1>
While the content researcher for a programme is usually a subject
expert ( a university lecturer, educationist, research assistant or
scientist, and so on), the field researcher works out the possible impact of
a particular programme in certain areas or on certain target audiences.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#65:1>
A Media Researcher knows best the format in which a certain kind of
information should be put to derive the maximum impact: whether to go in for
a documentary or a feature, a play or the folk form or a mix of more than one
genre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#66:1>
Here, again, a course in mass communication is an asset.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#67:1>
Any worthwhile production unit will demand the talents of a Media
Researcher. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#68:1>
Coming to the audible and visible components of the electronic
media, the most striking are the Announcer and the Newsreader.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#69:1>
Here, too, experience as a compere or presenter of programmes on a
casual basis in the youth sections proves to be an asset.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#70:1>
The basic requirements are a degree from a recognised university,
voice suited for broadcasting with good pronunciation and accent ( for
television, of course, a pleasing personality is an added requirement),
knowledge of the <O> <*> bold line </*> </O> <O> <&> tantalizer </&> </O> <O>
<*> bold line </*> </O> language relevant to the region, acquaintance with
cultural traditions and current affairs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#71:1>
The candidate is required to have some experience in broadcasting
and/or creative writing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#72:1>
Selection is on the basis of a written test ( n AIR), voice test,
screen test ( on TV) and interview.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#73:1>
The test may involve writing announcements, presentation scripts for
special programmes/ audiences, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#74:1>
The job in AIR involves even helping in production of programmes
and in maintaining records, reading scripts and stories.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#75:1>
On <indig> Doordarshan </indig> , however, the job is more
restricted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#76:1>
There are plenty of work opportunities for the Announcer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#77:1>
He or she can branch out into interviewing, presentation, and also
give voice over ( or commentaries) in documentaries and features in private
productions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#78:1>
It is a lucrative field besides offering interesting variety. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#79:1>
A Newsreader is expected to have qualifications similar to those
of the Announcer with added emphasis on general awareness and good
pronunciation, specially the name of people and places.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#80:1>
Quick-witted response to crisis situations is also expected as news
is always <quote> ` live' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#81:1>
Knowing more than two lnaguages, especially a foreign language, is an
asset.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#82:1>
Newsreaders have a special audition on both radio and television.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#83:1>
They too can find lucrative jobs in private productions as
commentators, comperes, interviewers and script readers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#84:1>
The News Section in AIR has a special importance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#85:1>
With a good command over language and a feel for the medium, you
could become a correspondent or reporter feeding the stations with
information from various places.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#86:1>
<indig> Doordarshan </indig> has a few correspondents but openings
in the organisation do not exist at present.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#87:1>
However, there is scope for television correspondents in agencies
like PTI or for video magazines like <it> Newstrack, India View </it> and
<it> Eyewitness </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#88:1>
A degree or diploma in Journalism or Mass Communication is necessary.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#89:1>
Television production holds out openings for other qualified
personnel also.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#90:1>
If you have done a <w> beautician's </w> course from any recognised
institution you can become a <quote> ` Make-up Artist' </quote> ; anyone
appearing before the strong lights of television needs his or her face
touched up to suit the camera.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#91:1>
If you have a degree in Fine Arts, you could become a Set Designer
for studio recordings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#92:1>
Experience in stage production is a desirable qualification.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#93:1>
A degree/ diploma in Commercial Art from a college of Art or any
polytechnic enables you to branch out into the expanding field of computer
graphics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#94:1>
The simple captions, line drawings, portraits, animated diagrams and
illustrations, graphs and maps that enliven any programme and clarify dull
or involved factual details, are very much in demand these days.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#95:1>
In this field, association with the advertising agencies is a
great help.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#96:1>
A computer graphics man can earn anywhere between <indig> Rs
</indig> 2,000 and <indig> Rs </indig> 10,000 per assignment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#97:1>
And how fast you can finish an assignment depends upon <O> <&> page
</&> 40 </O> you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#98:1>
The technical operations hold out a variety of employment
opportunities, too. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#99:1>
<h> <bold> Technical operations </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-014#100:1>
Production on radio involves mainly the Sound Engineer on the
technical front.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#101:1>
After recording the different ingredients - - statements,
interviews, sound effects, community and musicrequired for a programme on
a multiple track tape recorder, the Sound Engineer puts them all together
in the required sequence and proportion, in other words, edits the programme
on the directions of the Producer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#102:1>
It is now ready for broadcast. </p> <&> Tantalizer on page 40, in

<ICE-IND:W2B-014#104:1>
A career in the electronic media can be interesting and exciting, on
the face of it, even glamorous; but in reality it is hard work in a tough
world - - a world where you have to keep your wits about you to survive and
run faster and faster just to remain where you are <*> dotted line</*>
