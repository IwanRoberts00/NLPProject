<ICE-IND:W2F-011#5:1>
Returning from the learned conference at the port town, which he
had extended by several days, combining it with holy pilgrimages to various
shrines in the region, Hairy looked a different man, a changed man: subdued,
moody, quite out of character.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#6:1>
He appeared alarmingly tamed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#7:1>
But the change appealed to some of his colleagues; the Fertility
Goddess - - big with the next,but hoping for release at least with the next
issue - - even she picked up enough courage to pass him within touching
distance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#8:1>
Hairy now was a man who found himself on the brink of a vacuum, who
had come face to face with <w> life's </w> blank again, <w> life's </w>
dummy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#9:1>
His plans for prosperity had failed; pricking his spirit, puncturing
his very soul.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#10:1>
His vow of conquering 108 women had come up against treacherous rocks
submerged just below the surface of life - - how he had survived the ordeal
and ended up, rolled up, but all in one piece, on the <w> town's </w> railway
platform was a mystery to him: it had been a nightmare, but the evidence - -
the evidence showed on his body for days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#11:1>
But then destiny works out its own designs; a spirit schooled in
adversity will never say die.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#12:1>
St Jaans offered him, like a fond mother to her spoilt child, a
luscious teat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#13:1>
The college management made up its mind at last and advertised the
post of principal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#14:1>
And Hairy worried only about one candidate, Mrs Mocham.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#> But he was
not without his own plans. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 112 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#15:1>
Hairy called on his Cousin, the one he admired most among all his
illustrious cousins.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#16:1>
This Cousin - - his <w> mother's uncle's </w> co-brother's </w>
nephew - - was a minister in the central council of ministers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#17:1>
<w> Hairy's </w> father-in-law had suggested it long ago, even before
the first application for funds was made to him - - through the proper
channel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#18:1>
<w> Hairy's </w> wife had stoutly supported the idea but she kept
reminding him of it even as her wedding jewellery dissolved before her eyes
to support one or other of <w> Hairy's </w> fabulous ventures.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#19:1>
But Hairy always enjoyed doing things his own way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#20:1>
And he had his self-respect to consider, he had always considered a
visit to the minister a compromise on his principles.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#21:1>
But now he had learned his lesson: life is full of compromises; Hairy
now fully appreciated his <w> neighbour's </w> sermon backed by bulging
briefcases; he too must become a Realist.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#22:1>
Once he resolved thus, Hairy saw his cousin as the greatest Realist
of them all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#23:1>
So he went.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#24:1>
He went and sat at the feet of his Cousin on the regulation carpet,
touching the great <w> man's </w> feet, offering his head for the big man to
touch and bless.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#25:1>
Surrender was the need of the hour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#26:1>
<quote> ` <w> What's </w> the matter?' </quote> the Cousin asked
softly, with a smile.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#27:1>
No one had heard him raise his voice; this man radiated a
soft-spoken authority of unlimited power - - spiritual power.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#28:1>
Hairy mumbled, his hands folded reverentially: <quote> ` Your
blessings are everything I need.' </quote> The great man made a sardonic
gesture, <quote> ` I know that well enough,' </quote> it said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#29:1>
Hairy was struck by the brilliance of the man; he sat there with his
mouth half-open.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#30:1>
Without his <w> Cousin's </w> level of astuteness and intelligence,
one could not hope to be a successful Realist of the highest order. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#31:1>
The more Hairy thought of it, the less it surprised him: in all
his clan, the Cousin came of the humblest family twig; the humblest branch
bore the best fruit.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#32:1>
<w> Hairy's </w> parents had enough resources to send their only son
to a university; but the <w> Cousin's</w> parents were petty shopkeepers, and
wanted every son of theirs - - there were many - - to open his own retail
outlet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#33:1>
But this Cousin had other ideas, other plans, dreams - - what is a
great man without his dreams - - and a Realist starts early.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#34:1>
The Cousin soon made a name for himself as a hard-working and accurate
steno-typist.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#35:1>
He joined the government service - - Hairy saw the ring finger of
fate in <O> <&> page </&> 113 </O> it - - and of course his parents resented
his decision.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#36:1>
The <w> Cousin's </w> talents were discovered - - you cannot hide
live coals for long.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#37:1>
Hard work, application and above all, loyalty to his boss, the
Secretary to the Government, and then unflinching loyalty to the politician
who picked him for his personal assistant when he became a member of the
union council of ministers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#38:1>
The <w> Cousin's </w> reputation spread - - you can tell the presence
of a nightqueen even at a distance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#39:1>
His reputation rose steadily, like fermenting dough, and after stints
with various low ranking ministers, the Cousin was spotted accidently ( Hairy
saw the hand, in fact, both bejewelled hands, of Fate here).

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#40:1>
Even Realists need breaks, only they work for them and earn them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#41:1>
This cousin was picked up by the Big Man himself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#42:1>
Unprecedented rise, cried hoarse the <quote> ` lectuals' </quote> in
English newspapers, which nobody read, not the masses, anyway.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#43:1>
Marvellous rise - - first bureaucratic and then political.
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#> Enemies
of the Leader - - not just those in the opposition camp - - resented his rise
and hated the cousin for his political instincts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#44:1>
Wherever the leader went, he took the Cousin along.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#45:1>
The Leader took him, packed in his suitcase, so to say.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#46:1>
People could see the ex-stenotypist sticking close to the Leader,
following his boss faithfully,just a step behind him, in due deference, in
ultimate humility; carrying the <w> Leader's </w> speech for him and handing
it over to him after the Leader reached the podium.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#47:1>
Now everyone came to know that the speech, though penned by a senior
IAS officer who prided himself onhis <w> writer's </w> craft, had been vetted
by the Cousin with no academic qualifications except his high school
certificate, which was not worth anything anyway because the Cousin and the
Leader were not of the same caste.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#48:1>
What made all the difference was that having risen from among the
common people of India, the <w> Cousin's </w> heart throbbed in unison with
the popular will, the public mind; his corrections and amendments made all
the difference between a campus closet and the public platform.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#49:1>
And back in the capital, no appointments with the Leader were granted
without first being screened by the Cousin, cabinet ministers and
senior bureaucrats waited eagerly for a phone call from him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#50:1>
The Cousin knew, they all said, what was good for the Leader and what
was good for the Leader was good for the nation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#51:1>
Getting into the good books of the Cousin was imperative for the
highest in any sphere of public <&> page </&> 114 </O> activity; his
presence at a cocktail party was considered enough to make the evening a
sensational success; senior journalists - - and glamorous gossip columnists
openly fawned on him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#52:1>
But the Cousin spoke little and listened a lot - - the true mark of a
Realist.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#53:1>
All that he said, again and again, at every opportunity,was simple:
he may be drawing a salary from the Government of India, but his loyalty was
reserved for one individual, his Leader, and for one family, the <w> Leader's
</w> family - - his son and <it> his </it> grandson when they came to power.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#54:1>
Jealousy, malice, slander couldn't stop the Cousin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#55:1>
As everyone had expected, after the elections, the Cousin was inducted
into the central council of ministers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#56:1>
<quote> ` It has been a long time, Hari,' </quote> said the big
man, with quiet affection.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#57:1>
Such a memory for faces and names: Hairy felt ashamed; the last time
he had met with the Cousin was at the wedding of a cousin - - his <w> father's
</w> <w> cousin's </w> <w> sister-in-law's </w> grandson - - and the big man
had emotionally put his arm over <w> Hairy's </w> shoulders.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#58:1>
That gesture had brought tears to <w> Hairy's </w> eyes; and the great
man had said, <quote> 'Professor <indig> saheb </indig> , come and see us once
at least.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#59:1>
But Hiary had, most foolishly, not bothered.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#60:1>
Now he felt too ashamed to raise the subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#61:1>
<quote> ` Are you not interested in the post of Principal in your
great college?' </quote> the Cousin asked softly, looking at him for just a
second, a mere glance, smiling, gentle, noble, while thumbing through some
papers among the numerous files on his huge desk.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#62:1>
He pressed the button of the intercom and spoke to his PA for a
second or two, turned to his desktop computer, checked the appointment again,
received a call, gave instructions to his PA - - that had a call from the
Prime Minister - - and then he came back to Hairy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#63:1>
Hairy stood up, went round the stack of files, bent low and touched
his <w> Cousin's </w> feet, <quote> ` I need your blessings .' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#64:1>
The Cousin asked him to go into the house and meet the family. </p>
<*> star</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#65:1>
Mrs <w> Mocham's </w> cousin too was a minister; and a minister
of a higher rank than <w> Hairy's </w> Cousin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#66:1>
But Mrs <w> Mocham's</w> cousin was a scholar who fancied his own
scholarship; he had started his career asan IAS officer ( he got in at the
very first attmpt ) soon afterthe <O> <&> page </&> 115 </O> <w> country's
</w> independence and had climbed almost to thetop of the bureaucratic
ladder.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#67:1>
The he charmed the Big Man with his erudition in the privacy of his
bedroom, was duly conferred the title of <indig> Padma Shri </indig> , took
premature superannuation just before the last elections, stood for election,
and on his election to the parliament, was inducted into the cabinet and
entrusted with the portfolio of education and Culture.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#68:1>
Mrs Mocham had kept track of her <w> cousin's </w> progress, had sent
him sweets and flowers at every ascending step and now decided to benefit
from her investment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#69:1>
Visitors to Mrs <w> Mocham's </w> cousin were most impressed by
his study; all available space was taken up by books, not files; the scholar
found time to read books and also review themregularly even after his
induction into the union cabinet, in everything he wrote, he revealed his fine
taste for art objects and his enthusiasm for wildlife preservation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#70:1>
But then he had the peculiar habit of looking away from his visitors;
he addressed his queries, disconcertingly, to some point on the wall next to
them or beyond or above them, as though he was addressing himself or an image
of himself in an imaginary mirror.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#71:1>
His problem was he could not even contemplate talking to anyone
beneath him intellectually or morally.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#72:1>
He particularly resented any letters or petitions addressed to him
which did not carry his academic and professional titles, especially those
which did not acknowledge his Stanford degree or his title of <indig> Padma
Shri </indig> .</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#73:1>
Mrs Mocham knew her cousin well.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#74:1>
At St Jaans, anyone who dared to talk to her without looking at her
received from her the treatment he or she deserved; but now she commanded
hidden resources of patience and forbearance and went through her interview
with her cousin without any mishaps; there was only one hiccup, and that at
the very outset when the big man asked her if she had seen his essay on
Pleistocene rocks of the Deccan in <it> The Illustrated Weekly of North Bengal
</it> and Mrs Mocham fumbled and stuttered and recovered quickly to make an
earnest promise that not only would she read the article but she would get
every colleague and student of hers in St Jaans to read it and write
appreciative letters to the editor of the learned journal.</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-011#75:1>
To make up for her want of qualifications, Mrs Mocham suggested
to her cousin that the most important factor in her favour <O> <&> page </&>
116 </O> as far as the post of principal was considered was the preponderance
of girl students in St Jaans.

<ICE-IND:W2F-011#76:1>
But by then,the minister was already looking at the wall in the
distance. </p> </I>
