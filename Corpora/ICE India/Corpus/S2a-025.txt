<ICE-IND:S2A-025#1:1:A>
Good morning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#2:1:A>
Uh <,,> this is a short paper <,,> called <mention> Teaching classics in an  
unclassical situation </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#3:1:A>
Uh I didn't know what to do when I received a letter from <,> uh  
Professor Vanikar <,,> uh <,> asking me to participate in a <,> lecture  
series <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#4:1:A>
So I thought that I must write a lecture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#5:1:A>
But I didn't know that this is all this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#6:1:A>
But anyway I <,,> I hope <w> you'll </w> bear uh <,> these peculiar  
things from a teacher <,,> who has been trying to teach something impossible  
<,,> uh for <,> several years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#7:1:A>
When the <mention> Indira Gandhi Open University </mention> was  
launched some years ago <,,> somebody mentioned to me why an open university  
was needed then <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#8:1:A>
Most of the Northern universities had to be closed <,> for long  
spells of time <,> owing to one agitation or the other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#9:1:A>
And they had been sealed closed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#10:1:A>
The only university that could be open then <,> was the open one  
<,> which could not be closed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#11:1:A>
When I asked in a time honoured university a few years ago <,,>  
where was the student <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#12:1:A>
The teacher said <,> since attendance was voluntary <,> the  
students were not around <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#13:1:A>
This had shocked me <,> then thoroughly <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#14:1:A>
But when the same reason was given by another set of teachers <,>  
in another university <,> equally respected <,> just a few days ago <,,> I  
was not so much dismayed <,> as amused <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#15:1:A>
A university now was getting <O> one word </O> <,> of becoming <,>  
a fossil <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#16:1:A>
A discarded image <,,> and a discreditable model <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#17:1:A>
We say the teacher <,> you have to squeeze the university into  
museum <,> and a teacher into a zoo now <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#18:1:A>
When teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art <,,> practised  
<,> before the modern stone age <,> teaching a classic should be a gargantuan  
to an absurdity <,> or a quixotic misadventure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#19:1:A>
But <,> though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm  
of such a dark and hopeless comedy <,,> my experience with <,> both the  
classics <,> and the teaching has been mercifully otherwise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#20:1:A>
I may be allowed to boast <,> that even like the classics  
themselves <,> <w> I've </w> survived as a teacher <,,> teaching classics  
<,,> that too in an Indian situation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#21:1:A>
At the movement <,> I need not define a classic <,,> since everyone  
knows what it is <,> since you have to know what a thing is <,> even to  
reject it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#22:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> rather explain <,> what an unclassical situation is  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#23:1:A>
Apart from the unclassical situation <,> in the West itself <,,>  
which even Milton feared in his own time <,> whether he was writing his epic  
in an age too late <,,> in a cold climate <,> my damp is intended flight <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#24:1:A>
The Indian situation for the western classics <,> especially the  
ancient one <,> is apparently precarious <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#25:1:A>
Homer or Virgil <,> Dante or Milton <,> are not only not read in  
the schools or undergraduate classes here <,> perhaps with exception of some  
Milton <,> but well are unheard of <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#26:1:A>
There is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology <,,> or  
christian thought <,> of any real depth <,> before the students <,> join the  
post graduate classes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#27:1:A>
Nor is there any serious attention <,> to the history of ideas <,>  
or evolution of the western culture <,> is Greek or Roman Christian texture  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#28:1:A>
Any knowledge of Greek and Latin <,> or even a gentle fascination  
for them <,> <-> is anywhere in sight </-> <,> is nowhere in sight <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#29:1:A>
Again <,> there is no knowledge or sense of the genuises <,> rise  
evolution and decay of the stars of epic <,> tragedies <,> romance <,>  
allegory etcetera <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#30:1:A>
Nor is there a critical awareness <,> or <}> <-> <.> discuss </.>  
</-> <=> discussions </=> </}> <,> or the matters involved in the study of  
the classics <,> among the extremist either <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#31:1:A>
In short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned <,> you  
are working in a thorough vacuum <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#32:1:A>
Though your <w> teacher's </w> nature <,> may abhor it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#33:1:A>
If you have to reach the students with your classics <,> in your uh  
<,> ah in your hand <,> you have to undertake the adventure <,> of piercing  
through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold <,> or manifold ignorance <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#34:1:A>
But should you despair and give up the sword of teaching <,> then  
as a sheer wild goose chase <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#35:1:A>
<w> I've </w> an emphatic <mention> no </mention> to say to this  
pessimism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#36:1:A>
It is possible to put those classics across <,> to the students <,>  
Indian students <,> not because they are the <O> one word </O> or credilous  
<,> but because <,> the classics have an intrensic power <,> in themselves  
<,> on the one hand <,> and students have an intrensic an instinctive  
responsiveness <,> to them on the other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#37:1:A>
Should a classic fail <,> <w> it's </w> a pity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#38:1:A>
Something must be wrong either with the teacher <,> or with the  
student <,> and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#39:1:A>
It is a challenge for any teacher <,> to steer an ancient classic  
through successfully <,> in a class without being assisted by a cultivated  
response in it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#40:1:A>
But I think the solution to the problem should <-> be </-> divide  
another way <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#41:1:A>
Instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class <,,> a  
teacher has to exploit the virgin field <,> and convert innocence into an  
advantage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#42:1:A>
The basic wealth <,> he should realize <,> lies in the  
responsiveness of the class to any literature <,> our literature <,> British  
or <w> one's </w> own <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#43:1:A>
Once <w> he's </w> sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility  
<,> so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#44:1:A>
When I say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor <,> I  
do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an <,> easily knowable text  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#45:1:A>
The teacher should have a complex economy at his command <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#46:1:A>
He must know <,,> uh the right dosage of each element <,> before he  
administers a classic <,> to the open minded <-> class </-> <,> students of  
the class <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#47:1:A>
Were one <,> to teach for example <,> <w> Homer's </w> <mention>  
Illiad </mention> I <,> <w> I've </w> taken just one example <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#48:1:A>
One must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth <,> or  
archeology <,> he must give to his students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#49:1:A>
If you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic <,> you  
may not reach Homer at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#50:1:A>
On the contrary <,> you may raise serious suspicion <,> in the  
minds of the students <,> whether a poet called Homer ever existed at all <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#51:1:A>
Having introduced the term authentic <,> oral epic <,> you gently  
pass on to the Homeric age <,> or the heroic age <,> not as a fossil of  
history <,> but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the  
kind of epic that <mention> Illiad </mention> is <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#52:1:A>
If the students know nothing of the heroic age <,> Achilles would  
cut an utterly sorry figure before them <,> a spoiled child <,> a wilful  
imbecile <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#53:1:A>
Personal honour then was supreme <,> and dying for glory <,> the  
consummation <?> devastly </?> wished <,> by a hero was his name <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#54:1:A>
The co-ordinates of the age <,> co-ordinate <,> coincide with the  
co-ordinates of the morality of the hero <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#55:1:A>
The Lords have donned a heroic society <,> have to be <}> <-> <.>  
ac </.> </-> <=> accepted </=> </}> in a spirit of willing suspension of  
disbelief <,> or of a voluntary poetic accent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#56:1:A>
By this <,,> the epic is saved an enormous infancy <,> of  
primitivity <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#57:1:A>
With a select historisity in mind <,> you go straight to the human  
condition <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#58:1:A>
So that given <,> differing historical co-ordinate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#59:1:A>
There is an unerring core of the human fate involved <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#60:1:A>
Once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#61:1:A>
Similarly you have to introduce them <,> to the rules of the epic  
game <,> the conventions <,> the invocation <,> the catalogues of men and  
ships and so on <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#62:1:A>
The strolling epic simile <,> the ruthlessly delightful  
battlefields <,> the feudal games <,> the lamentations etcetera <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#63:1:A>
And then the gods <,> their politics <,> their devious ways <,>  
their over-determinations of human affairs <,> and <w> man's </w> constant  
negotiations <,> with them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#64:1:A>
The supernatural frame-work <,> not to be reduced to the  
supernatural machinery <,> that they use <O> one word </O> but to be kept <,>  
as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle <,> rise  
afore <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#65:1:A>
You have to identify and establish <,> the force of gravity <,>  
that holds in tension <,> the fears of men <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#66:1:A>
All this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship <,>  
but as a matter of enlighten information <,> to hinder the hindrances <,> to  
enjoying such works <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#67:1:A>
But this is only half the work <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#68:1:A>
You have to get the work closer to the world of the <w> students'  
</w> own experience <,> or sensibility <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#69:1:A>
I have been trying to do this <,> task not by denuding Homer of its  
specific <,> but by gathering him to a vision of what I might describe <,> as  
<w> poets' </w> perennial <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#70:1:A>
The perennial poetry <,> which refuses to divide poetic experience  
or vision in a parochial way and reduce <,> reduce it <,> to a <w> poets'  
</w> parochialist <,> uh provincial poetry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#71:1:A>
Explain the unknown Homer <,> in terms of the known <,> of  
<mention> the Upanishadas <,> the Vedas <,> the Bhagwatgeetas <,> the  
Mahabharat <,> and the Ramayan and the Bhagwat </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#72:1:A>
Do not tell me that our own works <,> are less known to our  
students <,> than the western classics <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#73:1:A>
I have been doing <,> in this way <,> from long before the <w> TV's  
</w> <,> had serialised <mention> the Mahabharat </mention> <,> and <mention>  
the Ramayan </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#74:1:A>
Our work <,> the culture that they are embodiments of <,> our  
already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#75:1:A>
And they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the  
teacher <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#76:1:A>
Let me give just a couple of examples <,> in a characteristically  
comprehensive Homeric statement <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#77:1:A>
In the thick of the battle <,> Dimades challenges Glocus and Glocus  
replies what does any lineage matter to you <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#78:1:A>
Men in the generations <,> are like the leaves of the tree <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#79:1:A>
The wind blows <,> and one years leaves are scattered on the ground  
<,> but the tree is burst into buds <,> and put on fresh ones <,> when the  
spring comes round <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#80:1:A>
In the same way <,> one generation flourishes and the another nears  
its end <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#81:1:A>
This <,> inevitably reminded me of the statement from the <mention>  
Katho Upanishad </mention> <,> <indig> Satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev  
tasya mev ajayte punha </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#82:1:A>
The muscle hyphens and <,> ripens <,> ends like corn <,> and stalks  
up again like corn <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#83:1:A>
The metaphor of the leaves in Homer <,> corresponds greatly with  
metaphor of the corn <,> in the <mention> Katho Upanishad </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#84:1:A>
And both bring out <,> vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of  
mutability <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#85:1:A>
The cycle of birth death and rebirth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#86:1:A>
The Homeric metaphor <,> as that of the Upanishadic <,> unites  
human experience <,> so effectively that you cease to separate the west from  
the east <,> and start inhabiting a common state of human faith <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#87:1:A>
To cite another example from the <mention> Illiad </mention> itself  
<,> here is Andromache <mention> Illiad book six </mention> <,> trying to  
persuade her husband Hector not to go to the fatal battlefield <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#88:1:A>
<quote> So you Hector <,> are father and mother <,> and brother to  
me <,> as well as my beloved husband <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#89:1:A>
Have pity on me now <,> stay here on the <?> tar </?> </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#90:1:A>
Put beside this <,> a statement from the <mention> Ramayana  
</mention> <,> made by Seeta as a confession of <w> Rama's </w> love for her  
<,> before Anusuya <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#91:1:A>
This is Ayodhyakand <mention> one eighteen </mention> four <,> uh  
<indig> Seetanurago dharmatma matrivat pitravat priyah </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#92:1:A>
With this kind of a parallel <,> so this is I think you will know  
this Sanskrit <,,> I mean the student <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#93:1:A>
Seeta in love <,> righteous <,> dear like the father the mother <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#94:1:A>
With the kind of a parallel in mind <,> you do not wish to separate  
the two works <,> the two culture <,> and see them in isolation <,> a bridge  
is flown across the two <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#95:1:A>
And the one text reinforces and illuminates the other <,> the  
phobia that a stranger <O> one word </O> is dissipated <,> and an Indian  
reader student teacher is gratified <,> that a common humanity pervades text  
apparently separated by differing cultures <,> and languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#96:1:A>
When I say this <,> I am not way laying the students <,> into the  
phony field of the comparative literature <,> as such but only knocking down  
walls or barriers that separates two literatures <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#97:1:A>
It is a matter of <,> of nativising <,> <-> alien </-> an alien  
literature <,> not by sipping it of its specifics <,> but by opening a new  
channel of communication <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#98:1:A>
So many problems of interpretation <,> both literary and  
theological <,> can be lightened by calling to aid works like <mention> the  
Mahabharat <,> Ramayan <,> Bhagwat </mention> and pressing them <-> to a  
service to to </-> <,> into service to gain and access into a pre-Christian  
work <,> like <mention> Illiad </mention> which raises insoluble problems in  
the mind of western Christian reader <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#99:1:A>
I have tried to put across <mention> Illiad </mention> <,> without  
tearing off its Roman roots <,> to my students by a free use of material <,>  
from our ancient texts <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#100:1:A>
The benefit has been double if not multiple <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#101:1:A>
Our students have freely enter the western classics with a native  
appreciation of them <,> on the one hand and <w> I've </w> seen the relevance  
<,> and significance of our own work <,> on the other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#102:1:A>
There was a time when the professor of English <,> looked down  
upon our works <,,> in a bid to <?> outer </?> English to English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#103:1:A>
Those days <,> I wish to believe <,,> are behind us <,> but that  
also implies a responsibility <,> a need to emancipate oneself from  
bookishness <,> into a heaven of genuine learning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#104:1:A>
<w> I've </w> been tackling works like the <mention> Illiad <,>  
Paradise Lost <,> The Divine Comedy </mention> <,> with an amount of freedom  
to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability <,> or mere tacit  
riven <,> and make them speak to us as living works <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#105:1:A>
<w> I've </w> also been trying to light up areas of darkness <,>  
in interpreting our own works <,> like <mention> the Mahabharat <,> Ramayan  
the Bhagwat </mention> all these <,> or the <mention> Bhagwatgeeta </mention>  
by a constant reference to the <mention> Illiad <,> the Aeneid Paradise Lost  
or The Divine Comedy </mention> so that <,> a new discourse is generated <,>  
by the free jostling together <,> of great works <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#106:1:A>
This has helped remove <,> to a great extent <,> the grimness <,>  
or the the gravity <,> the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works  
<,> fallen on the trodden ways of orthodoxy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#107:1:A>
The use of the Bible <,> both the old and the new Testament <,>  
the entire western mystical tradition <,> uh <,> has been of great benefit in  
the interpretation of our own works <,> too <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#108:1:A>
Here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse  
<,> and the great work starts becoming parts of the same space <,> the  
aesthetic and the ethical <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#109:1:A>
<w> I've </w> also been getting <,> appreciable success bringing  
together the Greek and the Shakespearian tragedies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#110:1:A>
Understanding a Greek phenomenon with a Shakespearian example <,>  
or vice-versa <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#111:1:A>
Should I read more <,> and be conversant with Sanskrit drama <,> I  
hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#112:1:A>
What <w> I've </w> uh been doing with the ancient classics <,>  
classics should be possible <,> with the post- renaissance <,> modern <,> and  
post-modern works too <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#113:1:A>
But one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were  
not to mess up things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#114:1:A>
This kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind <,> an  
intellectual tolerance <,> that makes holding many peaks of excellance or  
phenomenon of significance together <,> simultaneously without reducing or  
abolishing the uniqueness of each <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#115:1:A>
I also felt always <,> that a teacher needs to be free from any  
obsession <,> with one particular theory of literature <,> or <,> or  
criticism 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#116:1:A>
If <}> <-> you </-> <+> they </+> </}> want to save themselves  
from the dangers of distortion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#117:1:A>
At the same time <,> he must be fully aware of the whole plethora  
of the theory <,> so that he is able to make use <+> of </+> them freely <,>  
even as an electronics engineer <,> uses a thousand of keys <,> to produce a  
unified effect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#118:1:A>
I may however say that my key to the classics is only a key <,> a  
key <,> and I do not know of a master-key <,> which can unlock <,> uh the  
treasures <,> of all literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#119:1:A>
I do not exactly know <,> where I stand as regard to theme of the  
lecture series <,> creative writing and literature teaching interphase <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#120:1:A>
But this much I can say <,> that literature teaching is not <,>  
much less creative <,,> than creative writing itself <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#121:1:A>
In fact <,> you create as you teach <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#122:1:A>
And a creative work unless it is creatively read <,> remains just  
a close book <,,> it does not become a text <,> to borrow a term from Burke  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#123:1:A>
It is a teacher <,> who stigmaties to teach a text <,,> can really  
transform it into what it really is <,> a text <,> which requires <,> as  
Burke would say <,> an attempt to abolish <,> or atleast to lessen the  
distance between writing and reading <,> not by intensifying the readers <,>  
projection <,> into the work but by linking the two together <,> in a single  
signifying process <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#124:1:A>
A teacher <,> if he succeeds <,> does reduce the distance between  
writing and reading <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-025#125:1:A>
He rewrites the works <,,> and reincarnate the text <,> everytime  
<,> he successfully performs <,> in a class <,>

Thank you <,,> </I>
