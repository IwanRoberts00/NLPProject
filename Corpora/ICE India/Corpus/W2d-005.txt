<ICE-IND:W2D-005#3:1>
Focusing on judicial review to uphold the principle of Rule of Law,
the author discusses instances where such judicial intervention has created
uncertainties, factors exposing its systemic weaknesses, and the role and
responsibility of both lawyers and judiciary in promoting judicial
accountability in this regard. </it> </p> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#4:1>
THERE ARE several factors in modern democracies which constantly
threaten the civilised and civilising principle of Rule of Law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#5:1>
Lack of legal certainty, decline in the effectiveness of the law and
inequality in the legal processes tend to erode the supremacy of the law in
varying degrees.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#6:1>
These developments are at least in part due to the delay and
distortions in the judicial processes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#7:1>
This article examines the responsibility of judges in the production
of such distortions in Rule of Law in the course of the adjudicative
functions. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#8:1>
<h> JUDICIARY AND THE UNCERTAINTY IN LAW </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#9:1>
A desire to do justice in a particular case is understandably
characteristic of realist judges of all persuasions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#10:1>
But in some cases, they may find the facts or the principle not
supportive of their compassion for the <w> plaintiffs' </w> cause.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#11:1>
The Common Law, with its penchant for precedents and for judicial
restraint, tends to create dilemmas in the mind of judges, particularly of
the higher courts, who have inherent power to do justice.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#12:1>
When faced with such dilemma, different judges react and respond
differently, more according to their conscience and social philosophy than
according to the settled principles of law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#13:1>
Neither position seems to be entirely right and Rule of Law would
demand a fine balancing between the pre-existing law and the compulsions to
do justice in particular cases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#14:1>
What happens in actual practice is that many cases tend to create
uncertainty in law and eventual erosion of the Rule of Law principle.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#15:1>
It is not so much in civil and criminal cases that distortions to
Rule of Law become evident; it is in the adjudication of public law issues
that the malaise becomes apparent.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#16:1>
The recent spurt in public interest litigation in a variety of
situations, the <w> courts' </w> willingness to hear them relaxing procedural
bottlenecks and to issue orders of all types did increase access to justice
and <O> <&> page </&> 346 </O> extracted accountability from the executive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#17:1>
However, in the process of doing so, the question of judicial
accountability, particularly to Rule of Law and the scope of judicial
function itself came in for lot of criticism and some ridicule.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#18:1>
Is the debate motivated and ill-advised or is it justified and
desirable?

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#19:1>
There is an argument that courts are grabbing jurisdiction and
narrowing the scope of legislative and executive action.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#20:1>
While elected bodies are responsible for public policies, judicial
law-making may be undemocratic, <it> ad hoc </it> and contrary to the
constitutional scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#21:1>
The judicial defence that they are only interpreting the law and at
best only filling the gaps in the legal regime does not carry conviction,
particularly in parliamentary and executive circles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#22:1>
Judicial review is an acknowledged principle of consititutional
government.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#23:1>
The Indian judiciary has a proud record of upholding rule of law and
enabling constitutional governance even during very difficult periods.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#24:1>
Through invoking epistolary jurisdiction and responding to the needs
of access to justice for large masses of people, the Indian courts have
developed an illuminating branch of public law which deserves appreciation
from all citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#25:1>
Yet few lapses in this area by a few judges have justifiably let
credence to public outcry on issues of judicial accountability.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#26:1>
It is not clear whether it is the result of indivdual failures here
and there or indications of structural distortions arising out of
administration of justice to a vast and complex country like India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#27:1>
The expansion in numbers and the dilution of standards did contribute
to the erosion in quality of administration of justice to some degree.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#28:1>
Even though the distortions ae few and far between, its cost in terms
of Rule of Law to a developing democracy, like India, is indeed great and
sometimes very disturbing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#29:1>
To illustrate the point, responsible citizens point out the way
in which the Supreme Court has handled the medical college admissions and the
reservation controversy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#30:1>
Both are important issues affecting the social fabric in which
legislative action is what is ordinarily stipulated.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#31:1>
Once the court took cognisance of it, several issues cropped up, the
resolution of which was largely within the executive and legislative spheres
of government.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#32:1>
Orders of the Court came to be selectively enforced and quietly
disregarded which confounded the confusion and unsettled issues raising
doubts on the principles and procedures of law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#33:1>
Of course, the courts alone are not responsible for the prevailing
uncertainty and apprehensions about the scope of the law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#34:1>
The urge to correct injustices has led the courts to unchartered
spheres of governance in which judicial intervention was perhaps not
adequately matched with judicial restraint and statesmanship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#35:1>
Another grey area of uncertainty created by judicial process is
in respect of compensatory remedies courts allowed for violation of certain
fundamental rights.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#36:1>
The jurisprudence governing the remedy through constitutional courts
is yet to be settled and insitutionalised.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#37:1>
The result has been <it> ad hoc </it> responses depending upon the
judge rather than on principles of law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#38:1>
Similarly, the sentencing law, as evolved through decisions of the
higher courts, has led to <O> <&> page </&> 347 </O> some degree of
distortion in criminal justice administration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#39:1>
Again, the state of judicially evolved norms of administrative law is
in a state of continuing flux, leaving the civil services confused,
compromising efficiency and accountability in the administrative process.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#40:1>
What is <quote> ` State' </quote> ; who is a <quote> ` worker'
</quote> ; what constitutes <quote> ` industry' </quote> ; what are the
<quote> ` basic features' </quote> of the Constitution; when would the
imposition of death penalty become unconstitutional and similar concepts have
been expanded and interpreted sometimes through conflicting opinions leaving
the field for endless litigation and continued uncertainty of the law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#41:1>
If every situation is to be judicially tested in order to ascertain
the legal position, it does not portend well for good governance and for Rule
of Law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#42:1>
As one writer has put it, <quote> " <*> dotted line</*> The
unintended consequences of pseudo-realist adjudication have introduced a new
factor of legal unpredictability into human affairs <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#43:1>
Pseudo-realism introduces an incalculable retrospective effect
because the courts are attempting to create new aims for society or to impose
on society new basic directives.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#44:1>
Quite apart from any other misgivings one might have, this is
objectionable because of the limited participation in the decision by
litigants who: ( 1) generally represent only themselves, and ( 2) participate
in the decision only by evidence and argument addressed to the deciding
authority" </quote> . <sp> 1</sp> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#45:1>
<h> JUSTICE SHOULD BE SEEN TO HAVE BEEN DONE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#46:1>
It is trite to say that justice should not only be done, but
should be seen to have been done if respect for law and the judicial process
is to be maintained.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#47:1>
This demonstrative effect of Rule of Law is the result of a number of
factors, each of which has come to be tainted by certain developments to
which the judiciary is said to be responsible to a certain extent.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#48:1>
Some of these factors may be summarised as follows: </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#49:1>
1. <h> <it> Delay in Litigation: </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#50:1>
This has assumed scandalous proportions at least in certain areas
of litigation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#51:1>
Pendency of 20 <indig> lakh </indig> cases in various courts is
indeed an alarming situation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#52:1>
When it is realised that the figure would only increase in view of
the rate of filing of fresh cases each year and the continuance of outmoded
methods of judicial administration, there is reason to feel uncomfortable
about the future of the justice system itself.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#53:1>
There is no denying the fact that the degree of professional
competence of judges and their commitment to the integrity of the system are
contributing factors to delay in administration of justice.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#54:1>
Of course, one can legitimately explain causes of delay outside the
control of judges; but for the ordinary citizen, it is difficult to
appreciate that justice can be <O> <&> page </&> 348 </O> inordinately
delayed without the knowledge and connivance of the judges.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#55:1>
If judgements are not delivered in reasonable time after the hearing
of the case is completed, judges alone are to be accountable for it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#56:1>
If punctuality is not followed and court time is wasted, again, the
litigant public locate the fault on the judges only.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#57:1>
Comparative statistics of different courts indicate that judges with
a little more effort can be much more productive than what they are today
despite the inhospitable environment and poor support systems they presently
have. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#58:1>
2. <h> <it> Impartiality in Justicing: </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#59:1>
A number of principles of judicial propriety have been
incorporated in the system through unwritten laws and conventions to carry
conviction of impartiality among the litigant public.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#60:1>
They are matters of self-discipline which judges are supposed to
follow without external sanctions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#61:1>
If people were to litigate against judges for having allowed their
kith and kin to practise before the same court, it would be naturally
interpreted as indifference to principles of accountability.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#62:1>
To say that the impropriety is restricted only to appearance before
them and not before their other colleagues in different benches of the same
court may be technically right but in actual practice lacks credibility.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#63:1>
The image of impartiality cannot be taken for granted and has to be
meticulously built up by each and every judicial officer throughout his
career. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#64:1>
3. <h> <it> Politicisation of Judicial Appointments: </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#65:1>
It required at least two major public interest litigations and
over several years of public debate, before the procedure for appointment of
judges to the higher courts could be saved from unhealthy influences of party
politics and executives interference.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#66:1>
For judicial accountability, it is necessary that in matters of
appointments and transfers, the apex court should have a decisive say.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#67:1>
Insulating judiciary from political influences not only helps in
judicial independence but also gives the right message of impartiality in a
situation where the government itself is the largest litigant. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#68:1>
<h> ROLE OF LAWYERS AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#69:1>
In the final analysis, many of the ills of judiciary can be
traced to the doorsteps of the bar.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#70:1>
The judges are drawn from among lawyers and it is they who influence
judicial process by their actions and omissions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#71:1>
The bar and the bench are the two wheels of the chariot of justice
and unless both the wheels work in cohesion, even-handed justice will not be
delivered.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#72:1>
Therefore, whether its a question of delay in litigation, or an issue
of impartiality in justicing or criticisation of the judicial process, the
legal profession plays a significant role which is often noticed little by
the public at large.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#73:1>
If there is higher degree of accountability in the legal profession,
it is imperative that judicial accountability <O> <&> page </&> 349 </O> will
naturally follow.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#74:1>
More than anyone else, the members of the bar know their judges and
monitor their actions within and outside the courts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#75:1>
Judges cannot ordinarily defend themselves against public criticisms
whereas lawyers can.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#76:1>
And it is expected of the legal profession not to allow loose and
irresponsible talk about the judiciary and to the independence of the
judiciary at all times. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#77:1>
Ultimately, accountability is a matter of conscience of each
individual person.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#78:1>
A trained judge, when he assumes the divine role of dispensing
justice, is presumed to have sacrificed certain material pleasure open to an
ordinary citizen in return for the independent, exalted and noble function of
justicing on behalf of the State.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#79:1>
That is why certain privileges and immunities are provided to the
judge and the power to punish contempt is conferred on him.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#80:1>
If he cannot prevail over small temptations and succumb easily to
human frailities, he is unfit to be a judge and the people should have power
to recall such a person.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#81:1>
However, the power to recall has to be so structured that it does not
act to the detriment of impartiality and fairness implicit in judicial
functioning.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#82:1>
To avoid the extreme step of removal from office, it is incumbent on
the part of every judge to conscientiously and scrupulously follow the norms
of propriety and of judicial ethics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#83:1>
Let every judge remember the truism that justice should not only be
done but seen to have been done.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#84:1>
Let the advocates take a vow that they will not talk or do anything
in private or in public which has a tendency to belittle the judiciary and
expose the judges to unjustified public criticism and ridicule.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#85:1>
As the lawyers manage the profession through peer group justice, let
the judges put their house in order by the supervision, authority and
character of senior judges, of course extreme cases of judicial corruption
will invite the consequences under the ordinary law of the land and no
section of the profession will seek to protect such black sheep on extraneous
considerations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#86:1>
Because of few stray incidents of judicial improprieties noticed in
the recent past, the whole judiciary should not be condemned and it is all
the more reprehensible if lawyers themselves do so.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#87:1>
On balance, the Indian judiciary has a proud record of service and
integrity which is appreciated the world over.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#88:1>
No attempt should be made to tarnish this image, assiduously built up
over the years by generations of upright judges whose continued presence in
large numbers even today is the best guarantee of democracy and Rule of Law
in an otherwise grim situation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#89:1>
This is not to argue that aberrations are to be ignored or issues
of judicial accountability not discussed in public forums.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#90:1>
In a democratic society like ours, no insititution is above public
scrutiny. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-005#91:1>
It is the right and privilege of the legal profession, in
particular to judge the judges, provided they do so with restraint, with full
facts and with full responsibility for the consequences.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#92:1>
It is unfortunate that there is a tendency in some sections of the
bar ro disregard these wise principles of prudence and professionalism in
assessing judicial performance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#93:1>
Hence, the need for caution and circumspection.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#94:1>
There is need to collectively build institutional <O> <&> page </&>
350 </O> mechanisms and healthy conventions to prevent judiciary being
politicised or influenced by non-judicial considerations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#95:1>
There is equally a need to isolate individuals unworthy of judicial
office and proceed against them according to the due process of law.

<ICE-IND:W2D-005#96:1>
At the same time, all democratic forces must endeavour to prevent
destructive forces, making a mountain out of a mole hill and disparaging the
judiciary as a whole without realising the consequences to an institution
which more than any others preserved and promoted constitutional government
and Rule of Law in the country. </p> <footnote> <sp> 1</sp> Geoffrey De
