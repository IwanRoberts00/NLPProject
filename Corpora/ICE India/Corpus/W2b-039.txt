<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> tenacity with which the
body clings to life is awe inspiring.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#5:1>
It can tolerate the loss of the eyes, ears, teeth, limbs, a lung, much
of the intestines, the gallbladder, a major part of the liver and a kidney.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#6:1>
But if worse comes to worst, the body would even sacrifice the
reproductive system, if the life was at stake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#7:1>
The quality of life plummets with the loss of each organ but at least
the person survives.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#8:1>
In survival lies the hope that time may grant the person an
opportunity to reproduce before death.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#9:1>
And that is <w> life's </w> battle won <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#10:1>
An armoury of special devices and attachements that aid in this fight
against time is now available, thanks to the advances in biology. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#11:1>
For long, accident victims, war veterans and surgical amputees
have had to come to terms with their handicaps.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#12:1>
May be because of the highly organized and specialized tissue
architecture, human beings do not have the power of regeneration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#13:1>
A limb lost is lost forever !

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#14:1>
On this one count earthworms and the lowly planarian flat worms
are more privileged than humans !

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#15:1>
To make up for this handicap many prosthetic devices and aids have
been fashioned by man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#16:1>
Spare parts that can <O> photograph of a human body, in the middle of
page 22 </O> <O> <&> behind the photograph, an editorial comment at the end
of article </&> </O> replace any crippled organ in the body are now
available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#17:1>
Initially these were clumsy, cumbersome and crude.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#18:1>
But no longer !

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#19:1>
The quiet revolution that has characterized the last few years of the
dying century has changed all this.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#20:1>
Biomaterials are the low profile standard bearers of this
scientific advance that seeks to reconstruct or restore the lost or impaired
functions of the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#21:1>
Thus while man cannot sprout new organs to compensate for lost ones,
he is, technologically speaking, just one step short of it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#22:1>
The list of implantable devices to overcome a deficit is growing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#23:1>
Of course one cannot saunter into the supermarket to pick up a
spare part from the shelves, not yet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#24:1>
But the use of certain artificially made, biologically compatible
devices that help overcome an impairment is rapidly growing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#25:1>
Of these, hip replacements, contact and intraocular lenses and
heart pace makers are so commonly used that they do not even excite
curiosity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#26:1>
However, irrespective of how simple or how common they are, all
implantable devices face two problems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#27:1>
The first is that <O> <&> page </&> 22 </O> <O> photograph </O> <O>
caption </O> the body is uncompromisingly hostile to anything it senses as
<quote> " foreign" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#28:1>
Against things so labelled, the body unleashes all the aggressive
power its defense system can command.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#29:1>
Although the immunological rejection processes that occur with
organ transplants do not occur with the same severity with synthetic
materials, certain complications do arise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#30:1>
The interface of a functionally acceptable biomaterial with living
tissue may serve as a site subject to aggression by the <w> body's </w>
defense system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#31:1>
Under the circumstances, a complex series of reactions is set up
resulting in inflammation of the tissues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#32:1>
The second problem, of course, is that of replacing the living,
organized, dynamically responsive and complex tissues with nonliving and
unresponsive synthetic materials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#33:1>
Certain materials have been formulated which can help bypass
these problems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#34:1>
The amalgams used to replace tooth dentine, polymethylmethacrylate
in the intraocular lenses for the eye and the titanium replacement for
thigh bones are some examples. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#35:1>
The basic concept behind the creation of artificial organs can be
dated back to ancient men who first used wooden crutches for amputated limbs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#36:1>
After years of refinement, artificial arms, legs, teeth and aids for
defective vision became available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#37:1>
The 1940s and 1950s witnessed the development of the first
artificial kidney and heart-lung bypass machines.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#38:1>
Today several diverse fields such as chemistry, computers,
electronics, medicine and materials sciences are collaborating to form a
totally new discipline which can be called bioengineering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#39:1>
Bioengineering is a real ray of hope for the physically
compromised.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#40:1>
Take the case of a defective eye.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#41:1>
The eye is one of the most delicate and complex organs in the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#42:1>
Surgically it is readily accessible but the complexity of tears mean
that synthetic materials to be used in the eye need to have very special
properties.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#43:1>
Hydrogels have considerable potential in ophthalmic applications.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#44:1>
A detached retina can be re-attached to the choroid - - its source
of nutrition, by using a silicone rubber implant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#45:1>
A polyhydrogel implant, however, has additional advantages over
silicone rubber.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#46:1>
The material is soft, and unlike silicone rubber, it can be
impregnated with an antibiotic that can prevent post-operative infection.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#47:1>
Hydrogel coating on polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) lenses has
made them more acceptable and improves their biocompatibility as well as
their flexibility.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#48:1>
The flexibility of hydrogels means that the lenses can be folded and
inserted through a much smaller incision that would be necessary for a
conventional 'hard lens'.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#49:1>
Hydrogel impregnated lens can even be inserted while dehydrated
and allowed to hydrate in the eye. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#50:1>
A bright ray which is expected to illuminate the dark world of
the blind is the progress made by the artificial eye project headed by
William Dobelle, a physiologist and the Director, Artificial Organs Division
at Columbia University, USA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#51:1>
The artificial eye being developed here is based on direct electrical
stimulation of points in the visual cortex of the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#52:1>
Platinum electrodes are arranged on a thin plate made of Teflon,
which is inserted in a fold of the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#53:1>
Each time a points is stimulated by a minute electrical charge, a dot
of light appears in the visual field of the blind volunteer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#54:1>
The array used at present consists of 8 rows of 8 electrodes
which give very fuzzy images ( 64 in all ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#55:1>
But future arrays will have hundreds of electrodes, and allow the
blind to visualize pictures.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#56:1>
The current 64-array system allows the user to read Braille by seeing
rather than by feeling the letters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#57:1>
Despite advances, this system has one drawback.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#58:1>
There is no correlation between the area of the visual cortex being
stimulated and the location of the dot of light in the <w> volunteer's </w>
visual field.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#59:1>
Thus, every user must have his visual cortex mapped.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#60:1>
But once the map is completed, information is transmitted
regularly to the used.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#61:1>
In addition to a more advanced electrode array and neurophysiological
data needed to stimulate the brain, future advances will incorporate the use
of viewing devices along the lines of a miniature TV camera and a mini
computer to translate what the viewing device sees into the proper
stimulation pattern for the visual cortex to perceive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#62:1>
The National Science Foundation in the USA has also been working to
devise photosensitive biochips into the visual cortex of the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#63:1>
A biochip is the cousin of the silicon chip and like it contains a
complex electronic circuit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#64:1>
But the signals in a biochip are individual electrons shunting
between organic molecules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#65:1>
Biochips are minute, function at extremely low power, at the
molecular level and yet are enormously complex and sophisticated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#66:1>
Biochips are made out of natural substances such as proteins and
it is possible that they might form their own linkages with other organs,
once implanted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#67:1>
This would help form links with the body and perform more varied
functions while in place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#68:1>
The artificial eye has also encouraged researchers to
experimentally produce an artificial ear as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#69:1>
This model provides electrical stimulation of the inner ear.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#70:1>
But developing an analogue for normal ears is not as easy as it
sounds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#71:1>
For one, the perceived pitch of a sound can be affected both by the
placement of the electrode in the <O> <&> page </&> 23 </O> inner ear as well
as by the frequency of the electrical stimulation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#72:1>
Extremely promising advances have been made in the field of
artificial limbs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#73:1>
Artificial limbs have been used for centuries and the Jaipur limb is
justly famous.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#74:1>
But truly electrifying progress, using light weight yet strong
materials together with miniaturized electric motors controlled by
microcomputers, have been made recently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#75:1>
An experimental model has electrodes that can be attached to the
nerves sent by the central nervous system to control the movement of the
muscles of the limb now lost.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#76:1>
These myoelectric signals are converted by a microcomputer into
controls for small electric motors that power the artificial arm.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#77:1>
Thus an imputee can move his artificial arm by just willing himself
to carry out the action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#78:1>
Finger joints made of Silastic ( a composite of silicone and
plastics ) can be implanted in any finger and these have normal bending
ability.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#79:1>
Artificial skin available in various colour tones can cover the limbs
and the circuitry involved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#80:1>
The artificial skin also simulates the appearance of natural human
skin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#81:1>
Certain organs too stand to be aided by artificial support
systems should they be weakened or failing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#82:1>
The pancreas, for example, secretes insulin that helps regulate blood
sugar levels of the body. <O> photograph in middle of page </O> <O> caption
</O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#83:1>
The results of a pancreas functioning below par and that of a
pancreatectomy following cancer are the same.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#84:1>
Victims usually become dependent on daily doses of insulin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#85:1>
Bioengineers are developing artificial pancreas for them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#86:1>
While these man-made pancreas will not completely reproduce the
functions of the natural pancreas, it will automatically provide the
correct amount of insulin whenever the need arises.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#87:1>
Artificial pancreas consist of a glucose sensor, a pump and an
insulin supply.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#88:1>
When the glucose level in the blood rises to a predetermined level,
the sensor activates the pump.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#89:1>
The pump then injects insulin into the blood stream.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#90:1>
Proto-types of artifical pancreases have already been tested
successfully in human volunteers and long term implantable versions are
being perfected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#91:1>
Artificial kidneys or dialysis machines are of course not new.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#92:1>
They have been used for patients with kidney failure for more than 30
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#93:1>
These machines replace the filtering function of the natural kidneys.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#94:1>
During dialysis, the <w> patient's </w> blood is pumped over a
memberane on the other side of which is a dialysis fluid.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#95:1>
Waste materials present in the blood can cross the membrane and enter
the dialysis fluid.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#96:1>
Following dialysis, the blood is returned into the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#97:1>
Generally, dialysis requires that the patient be attached to bulky
equipment for long hours every week.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#98:1>
Small kidneys have been developed, but even this involves the use of
a large liquid container.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#99:1>
These small kidneys use a technique called hemoperfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#100:1>
In this, blood is passed over substances such as coated charcoal or
resin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#101:1>
Even portable versions of small kidneys are available for use during
journeys but the smaller artificial kidneys do not remove enough of urea, the
waste chemical, for a completely wearable artificial kidney to be
prescribed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#102:1>
The liver is yet another extremely important gland in the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#103:1>
It accounts for about 2 per cent of the <w> body's </w> weight and
takes part in myriad functions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#104:1>
Many toxic substances in the body are detoxified by the liver.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#105:1>
So when the liver fails, the life of a patient may be in jeopardy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#106:1>
Now external liver-assist devices or <mention> ELADs </mention> may
be pressed into service.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#107:1>
The simplest <mention> ELAD </mention> works like kidney dialysis
machines.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#108:1>
A bundle of hollow fibres made out of a filter like membrane is
placed in a canister.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#109:1>
Liver cells or hepatocytes taken from pigs coat the outside of
each fibre.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#110:1>
As the <w> patient's </w> blood flows through the fibres, it
exchanges chemicals, gives up waste products and receives nutrients.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#111:1>
The problem with <mention> ELAD </mention> was to sustain the
hepatocytes since these cells are fussy about the environment they need when
being grown outside the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#112:1>
Other researchers have tried to solve this problem by providing
the hepatocytes with nutrients.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#113:1>
Well nourished hepatocytes are logically expected to carry out
their functions better.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#114:1>
Rat hepatocytes are packed inside the hollow fibres and fed by
supplementary nutrients while blood runs through the gaps between the
strands.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#115:1>
This liver aid device was recently tested on rabbits which had
had their livers removed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#116:1>
The <mention> ELAD </mention> gave the liverless rabbits a second
lease on life for 36 hours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#117:1>
If the experimental studies on dogs too go as expected, human
trials should start soon after that. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#118:1>
In an advanced model of the liver aid devices the plasma is
separated from the <w> patient's </w> blood and pumped through the pig
hepatocytes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#119:1>
It is then passed over an activated charcoal filter before being
mixed with the cellular portion of the blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#120:1>
The reconstituted blood is returned to the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#121:1>
Achilles A. Demetriou, a surgeon at the Cedars Sinai Medical Centre
in Los Angeles used this <mention> ELAD </mention> on ten patients to bring
back eight of them from <w> death's </w> door.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#122:1>
These patients had been so ill and moribund that they had been
disqualified as potential recipients of liver grafts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#123:1>
There is one problem common to devices such as these.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#124:1>
They all need to have some connection between the <w> recipient's
</w> body and the power source or controlling unit outside the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-039#125:1>
In case of dialysis machines, a fairly <O> <&. page  </&> 24 </O>
<O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> large sized blood vessel is needed to
which the device can be hooked. </p> <&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-039#126:1>
<it> An armoury of special devices and attachments is now
available: 1 skull plate, 2 acrylic eye, 3 plastic ear, 4 upper dentures, 5
chin implant, 6 jawplate, 7 electronic larynx, 8 filter to prevent blood
clotting in the lungs, 9 pacemaker in heart, 10 heart valve, 11 heart patch
