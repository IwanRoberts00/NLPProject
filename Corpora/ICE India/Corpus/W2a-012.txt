<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> least that can be said is
that we are today living in interesting times.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#5:1>
It would not be untrue, or even an exaggeration, to say that no
other period of 12 months in the whole history of our planet has seen such
incredible changes as have taken place in the last 12 months.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#6:1>
The Berlin Wall has been broken; the two Germanies have been united.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#7:1>
Communism has been disowned not only in the countries of Eastern
Europe, which were euphemistically known as the socialist bloc, but in its
very heartland, <O> tantalizer 1 </O> the birth place of Lenin and Stalin,
the Soviet Union itself.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#8:1>
Thoughts which would hitherto have been considered blasphemous, such
as a free market economy, are now being openly, unabashedly and forcefully
expressed and elaborate programmes chalked out for their speedy
attainment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#9:1>
As if to show that this is not just a European phenomenon, China,
the <*> line</*> sleeping giant of Asia, hitherto a great bastion of
Communism, is not immune to the winds of change though, not progressing
towards liberalisation at as fast a pace.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#10:1>
Not only windows, but doors are being opened for economic
participation to people and systems which till recently were anathema to the
ruling clique. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#11:1>
No less remarkable have been the events in South Africa.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#12:1>
Though it is too soon to say that Apartheid has been dismantled or
disbanded, it is certainly much less rigid than it has ever been during the
last 40 years since it was so blatantly and brazenly proclaimed as an
article of faith by the late unlamented Dr. Daniel Malan. </p>

<h> <bold> Socialism in Flight </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#14:1>
A question may be asked as to what the above exposition of
politics and recent history has got to do with this paper, which is on a
fiscal-cum-economic subject.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#15:1>
The answer is that, except for the developments in South Africa, all
the other apparently political developments have, in fact, an economic
main spring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#16:1>
If the East Germans wanted to be united ( I shall not use the word
<quote> " merged" </quote> for fear of wounding the sensitive East German
ego!), with their West German counterparts, it was not political freedom
alone on the other side of the WaIl, which lured them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#17:1>
More than anything else, it was the <w> latter's </w> economic
development and industrial advancement, which acted as the magnetic pull.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#18:1>
Similarly, if the other European socialist nations, like
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania and Poland decided to change the basic
structure of their lives, it was in order to improve their economic <O>
tantalizer 2 </O> lot.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#19:1>
Perhaps, there is a lesson in all this, which we in this part of the
world can ignore only at our peril. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#20:1>
The historical message, therefore, is loud and clear.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#21:1>
Socialism is on the run.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#22:1>
It was given a fair chance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#23:1>
In the USSR, it ran for over 70 years, more than the full length of
the biblical life span of man !

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#24:1>
In the East European socialist countries, the innings, though
undoubtedly shorter, still covered four to five decades.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#25:1>
At the end of it all, the preaching and practising high priests of
socialism have realised that the system did not <O> <&> page </&> 713 </O>
really deliver the goods.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#26:1>
The phrase, which has been just employed, is not metaphorical,
because <quote> " goods" </quote> , after all, is the name of the development
game !

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#27:1>
Many years ago, Koestler achieved fame for himself by writing a
best-seller called <quote> " The God that Failed" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#28:1>
The God, of course, was communism, though the allusion, to
Divinity, is more than a little ironic, since communism is essentially
atheistic!

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#29:1>
However, be that as it may, history has borne out his prophecy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#30:1>
In a way, the failure of socialism, is a failure of the knowledge
of human psychology.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#31:1>
Man is basically acquisitive and avaricious in his outlook.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#32:1>
He would work best, when he can reap the fruits of his own toil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#33:1>
He would work for money, he would work for honour, he would probably
work for love but he would not work for the State, beyond a certain point.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#34:1>
Probably sensing the message of the times and recognising the
universal withdrawal from socialism, a known socialist, who presented the
last budget in my country, was constrained to make the apologetic and
defensive observation that he was not a doctrinaire socialist! </p> <O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#35:1>
The reader might wonder what point I am trying to derive or drive
home from the above narrative and, therefore, it is my duty to satiate his
curiosity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#36:1>
The difference between socialism and capitalism, though fundamental,
is really quite narrow.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#37:1>
The former lays stress on the distributive aspect and the latter
on the productive one.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#38:1>
The former is obsessed with distributing the existing cake
equally, while the latter is absorbed in increasing the size of that cake
so that all may get more, even if it is not necessarily equally.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#39:1>
As a result of the inexorable working of economic forces, the bigger
cake would also lead to more egalitarian distribution. </p> <O> tantalizer 4

<h> <bold> Poverty - - the No. 1 Foe </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#41:1>
Since the beginning of human life, the arch enemy of mankind has
not been any particular individual or idea or system but a condition which
goes by the name <quote> " poverty" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#42:1>
This is not something peculiar to my country or to this part of Asia.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#43:1>
It is a universal phenomenon present in the industrialised and
developed world alike, though, no doubt, to a much lesser extent in the
former.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#44:1>
The first step in military strategy is to recognise the foe.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#45:1>
Having identified poverty this way, we can say that we have
negotiated this first step. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#46:1>
Having identified the enemy, the next step is, of course,
vanquishing him.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#47:1>
The only way, that I know by which this can be done is by the
creation of wealth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#48:1>
It is said idiomatically that one must set a thief to catch a
thief.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#49:1>
However, this does not hold good here.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#50:1>
Just as a dog does not eat another dog, one cannot vanquish poverty
with poverty.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#51:1>
The only thing which can vanquish poverty is its antonym, namely
wealth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#52:1>
One must, therefore, create as much of it as one can. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#53:1>
<h> <bold> Prejudice Against Wealth </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#54:1>
Time was when <quote> " profit" </quote> was considered a
dirty word.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#55:1>
Today, happily, it is looked upon more kindly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#56:1>
However, nature abhors a vacuum, and, accordingly, the word <quote> "
wealth" </quote> to some minds, now occupies the vacated slot in the dirt
dictionary as an unworthy concept, an economic pariah.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#57:1>
Human perception is often warped: straight thinking, therefore, is at
a discount.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#58:1>
As a result, almost a comical situation develops, wherein, even after
having identified <w> one's </w> enemy, instead of turning <w> one's </w>
guns at him, one turns the guns at the very person who could suitably do
battle with the enemy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#59:1>
We all agree that people must be raised above the poverty line.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#60:1>
To put it conversely, the poverty line must be lowered so that there
are more people who out-surface it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#61:1>
In other words our straggle, our endeavour, must be focussed
undivertingly on the poverty line.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#62:1>
Despite this, it is almost comic that just a few months ago, a high
political dignitary in this part of the world talked albeit rather
casually about the affluence line, apparently hinting that a person should
not amass wealth beyond a particular point.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#63:1>
This, I think, is a pernicious thought.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#64:1>
National wealth is the sum total of individual wealth and, if our
goal is to increase national wealth, it can be achieved only by tolerating (
if not <O> tantalizer 5 </O> encouraging ) the components of inlividual
wealth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#65:1>
In the <w> writer's </w> view, therefore, nothing could be so
selfdefeating as the project of delineating the so-called affluence
line. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#66:1>
To recapitulate, our proclaimed enemy is poverty, and our best
weapon against it, is the creation of wealth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#67:1>
Wealth, again, can result only from economic development, both
agricultural and industrial.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#68:1>
To state the most sterile truism, development requires resources - -
monetary, material and human.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#69:1>
The resources can be acquired only by human endeavour.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#70:1>
No doubt, there are many natural resources and happy is the land
which possesses them in abundance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#71:1>
However, ultimately, it is human beings who exploit them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#72:1>
It is, therefore, the human factor which must be nurtured.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#73:1>
This paper has already had occasion to cite two proverbs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#74:1>
A third one now comes to mind: <quote> " Money leads the mare."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#75:1>
It is, accordingly, monetary incentives, which appear to be the
key.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#76:1>
To invoke a fourth metaphor: it is the carrot, and not the stick,
which must play the lead role. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#77:1>
The proposition that this paper is advancing is that the maximum
money must be left in private individual <O> <&> page </&> 714 </O> hands to
promote development.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#78:1>
It is the well-known experience of mankind that private initiative
is always more effective, more efficient and more enterprising than the
public one.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#79:1>
With a maximisation of private initiative, there would be a
minimisation of corruption.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#80:1>
Corruption breeds in an atmosphere of controls, and controls are,
almost by definition, inseparable from public regulation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#81:1>
Theoretically, it may appear that the ideal environment for
economic development would be a taxless society.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#82:1>
Such thought, however, apart from being impractical would also be
deceptive.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#83:1>
It would be impractical, because the State needs money for
defence, law-and-order; communications; diplomatic ties, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#84:1>
It would be deceptive, because there can be no proper or, at least,
speedy economic development without the necessary infrastructure, which,
in most cases, can be best provided by the State.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#85:1>
For this also, therefore, taxes would be required. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#86:1>
In fact, it must have been this realisation which prompted a
great scientist-cum-politician of the l8th century to make the depressing
profound observation that nothing in this world can be said to be certain,
except death and taxes!

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#87:1>
Having reconciled ourselves, therefore, to the <O> tantalizer 6
</O> inevitability of taxes, the problem is not only how to live with them
but also how to harness them to promote the noble cause of economic
development, the pursuit of which is beyond controversy. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#88:1>
<h> <bold> Savings - - Removal of Disincentive </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#89:1>
The object of economic development is beyond controversy, so
also the means through which it can be achieved.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#90:1>
Economic development requires investment and investment requires
savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#91:1>
Almost the first object of a taxation policy, therefore, should be
to promote and encourage savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#92:1>
A person who saves must be rewarded.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#93:1>
Instead, we find today, that savings are subjected to a tax which
goes under the name wealth tax, because, wealth, after all is accumulated
savings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#94:1>
It is a <w> man's </w> income minus his expenditure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#95:1>
These savings should qualify for a relief and not an additional
impost.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#96:1>
This may sound a revolutionary idea, if not utopian.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#97:1>
The touchstone, of all ideas, should be not their novelty or
departure from tradition but their rationality and capacity to stand the
ruthless inquisition of logic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#98:1>
As a matter of fact, wealth-tax <O> tantalizer 7 </O> amounts to
double taxation, because wealth is made up of that part, of income which has
not been spent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#99:1>
Since income itself would have been initially taxed, subjecting it
again to another tax ( albeit under a different label ) clearly amounts to a
repeat levy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#100:1>
That the charging rates of wealth-tax, on the saved income are
much lower than the rates at which tax was charged on the earned income, may
mitigate the levy but does not excuse it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#101:1>
Again, the income which has been spent away, is obviously beyond
the reach of the wealth-tax.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#102:1>
This means that the squanderer of income is at a premium in
comparison with the saver.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#103:1>
This goes against the basic proposition that saving holds the key to
development. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#104:1>
Wealth-tax being conceptually a tax on savings, is unjustified.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#105:1>
However, it is possible to make a resultoriented exception.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#106:1>
The case against wealth-tax rests on the assumption that the
savings, which are subjected to tax have been appropriately invested in a
development-oriented manner.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#107:1>
Thus, savings, which are used to acquire fixed assets that
directly contribute to production, must obviuosly be considered to be
development-oriented.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#108:1>
Similarly, savings in the form of shares, debentures, bonds, bank
and other deposits, which, though not directly contributing to production,
serve that purpose indirectly ( by feeding those who contribute to
production themselves, may be also considered to be development-oriented
<+> ) </+> , thus qualifying for immunity from wealth-tax.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#109:1>
However, the position would be different for savings transformed
into, say, bullion, jewellery, vacant land, unproductive vehicles, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#110:1>
Thus, as far as such assets are concerned, they could probably be
legitimately subjected to this levy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#111:1>
No doubt as already discussed above, this would still partake
of the character of double taxation as the source of these assets would
have been income which has been subjected to income-tax.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#112:1>
This aberration, however, may be a necessary sacrifice to be
offered at the altar of economic development.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#113:1>
In any event, avoidance of this double taxation would be in the <w>
assessee's </w> own hands - - because he could redeploy his assets into
development channels. </p> <O> tantalizer 8 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-012#114:1>
The above measure may not be really an incentive to savings, but
only a removal of an existing disincentive.

<ICE-IND:W2A-012#115:1>
In other words, the tax on the savings ( which is what the
wealth-tax is ) invested in productive and development-oriented assets
should be removed. </p> <&> tantalizer 1 on page 713, column one </&>
