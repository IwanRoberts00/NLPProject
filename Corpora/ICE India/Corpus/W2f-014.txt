<ICE-IND:W2F-014#1:1>
Next morning Peter hovered anxiously outside <w> Mabel's </w>
bedroom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#2:1>
She had never been so late for breakfast.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#3:1>
When he took in her <it> chota hazari </it> instead of sitting up in
bed she had mumbled that he keep it on the night table.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#4:1>
He had sent Laxmi <indig> ayah </indig> inside to check and got the
report that Missy Baba was still in bed with the quilt over her head.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#5:1>
She had never done this before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#6:1>
Even if the old Master and Missy Baba had come back at five am from a
Club dance they had got up on time to go to the stables.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#7:1>
They took a long nap in the afternoon but never shut out the daylight
by going under a quilt.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#8:1>
Should he call the doctor?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#9:1>
Just then he heard the bell ring from <w> Mabel's </w> room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#10:1>
He darted in sooner than she expected his appearance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#11:1>
She was standing next to her bed slipping on her dressing gown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#12:1>
<quote> ` Missy Baba not well?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#13:1>
I thinking call doctor,' </quote> he asked in a hushed voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#14:1>
<quote> ` No, no Peter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#15:1>
<w> I'm </w> all right.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#16:1>
You should have woken me up.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#17:1>
<quote> ` I call with tea, Missy,' </quote> he said in an injured
tone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#18:1>
<quote> ` There, see tray on table.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#19:1>
<quote> ` So you did, Peter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#20:1>
Sorry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#21:1>
I slept very late <*> dotted line</*> er, kept reading.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#22:1>
Get me bath water, please.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#23:1>
No breakfast.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#24:1>
Just a cup of tea.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#25:1>
<quote> ` Missy Baba, Mister Fali phone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#26:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#27:1>
` <quote> Yes, I know.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#28:1>
The <indig> Raja </indig> of Gawda and his son Pratap are coming to
visit the stables.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#29:1>
<w> I'm </w> so fearfully late.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#30:1>
Can you hurry up, please?' </quote> </p> <O> <&> page </&> 49 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#31:1>
<quote> ` Yes, I hurry,' </quote> he said and went out in a rush.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#32:1>
By the time she arrived at the stables feed was being doled out
to the syces sitting in a circle.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#33:1>
The buckets in front of them were being filled up with different
formulas of oats, barley, wheat bran, shark-liver oil, and shamatone,
supervised by Terence Hardy, the stud superintendent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#34:1>
She knew he was puzzled about her late appearance, but she walked on
towards the office without giving him any explanation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#35:1>
At the lines, work was going on quietly and efficiently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#36:1>
Stable boys under the watchful eyes of the <indig> <it> jamedars
</it> </indig> were rubbing down the horses with brush and <indig> <it>
Kharara </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#37:1>
Mabel held her breath as she skirted around the hay spread out to dry
in the sun.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#38:1>
She picked up a handful of lucerne grass and offered it to horses who
were sticking their necks over their wickets in joyful recognition.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#39:1>
When she came to Merbani she gave him an extra helping, asking him
not to tell the others that he was favoured.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#40:1>
She wanted to know his opinion about racing at Mahalaxmi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#41:1>
He nodded enthusiastically. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#42:1>
She climbed the staircase to her office above the stores.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#43:1>
Before going in she paused on the deck, as she always did, to savour
the panoramic view of the green and white symphony of the buildings Jay
Gee had so carefully planned.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#44:1>
She spotted the black baret of Fali Mehta, her trainer, coming
through the trees, hurrying to meet her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#45:1>
<quote> ` Come in,' </quote> she said when he knocked on her door.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#46:1>
<quote> ` Good morning, Miss Dunne.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#47:1>
<quote> ` Good morning, Fali, <w> I'm </w> sorry I wasn't up when
you called.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#48:1>
Had a late night.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#49:1>
<quote> ` It was somewhat strange not to find you here in the
morning.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#50:1>
Peter got me worried when I phoned the Dunne House.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#51:1>
I wouldn't have disturbed you but the <indig> Raja </indig> of Gawda
rang up to find out what time he and his son could visit Dunnestable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#52:1>
He said you had asked him to ring up.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#53:1>
<quote> ` What did you tell him?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#54:1>
<quote> ` I said you were not in the office, that you were
visiting the stables.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#55:1>
Fali smiled but finding Mabel unresponsive he <O> <&> page </&> 50
</O> asked hastily, <quote> ` I hope I didn't do anything wrong by telling
them to come around eleven?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#56:1>
Mabel looked at the clock on her left wall and said, <quote> `
Another half-hour.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#57:1>
No, you did the right thing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#58:1>
He wants to transfer his string of horses to us.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#59:1>
I insisted he come and see our establishment before he did that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#60:1>
<w> What's </w> going on this morning?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#61:1>
<quote> ` The vet is doing the pregnancy tests.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#62:1>
<quote> ` <w> I'll </w> go there, Fali.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#63:1>
You can bring them over when they arrive.' </quote> she said, pulling
her chair back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#64:1>
She felt a compulsion for action, for immersion in her work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#65:1>
She slipped on her tweed coat with leather patches, worn but intact,
at the elbows.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#66:1>
After all the years the coat still had a whiff of his body in it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#67:1>
She had had it cut down to her size by making the tailor sit at Dunne
House rather than take it to his shop.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#68:1>
She had sat on the verandah while he worked on it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#69:1>
Her hand moved from her riding hat to her <w> father's </w> pith
helmet on the rack.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#70:1>
She flicked the dust off and put it on her head and peered in the
mirror.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#71:1>
Lucy was not wrong, she thought.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#72:1>
Jay Gee was here all right. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#73:1>
Mabel crossed the deck and was about to step down when she turned
back to revisit the office.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#74:1>
She phoned the stable and asked for Destiny to be saddled and brought
as soon as possible.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#75:1>
She waited on the deck looking at the spread of Dunnestable around
her, indulging in nostalgia.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#76:1>
She recalled the first day of <w> India's </w> independence when Jay
Gee had presented her with a filly born that morning and named Destiny by
him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#77:1>
He had liked the phrase, <quote> ` Tryst with Destiny' </quote> ,
when he had heard it in a midnight speech of Nehru on his bedside radio.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#78:1>
He had toasted the infant Republic with beer before lunch, analysed
the reasons for their confidence in the Indian Cabinet, and appreciated its
choice of Lord Mountbatten as the first Governor-General of free India.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#79:1>
Jay Gee had often got into passionate discussions with pessimistic
and bitter English bureaucrats and military officers at the Belpur Club.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#80:1>
They had unanimously forecast a downhill slide for a free, but
unready India.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#81:1>
The <O> <&> page </&> 51 </O> sub-continent, according to them, would
never be able to surmount its diversity and disparities, and emerge in the
twentieth century as an equal of the other nations of the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#82:1>
Over round after round of drinks Mabel had sat and watched her
father debate without convincing anyone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#83:1>
Rejected and isolated, he would bring his arguments back to Dunne
House and exhaust himself over brandy and cigars before allowing Peter to
persuade him to retire to bed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#84:1>
It was then that she had understood why Indians, under his
jurisdiction as a Commissioner, had loved him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#85:1>
Well, his faith had not been misplaced.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#86:1>
India was doing all right, not bad - - so far.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#87:1>
The Indians were certainly not killing every Muslim, or throwing out
all the Englishmen.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#88:1>
Even statues of old rulers were allowed to sit, or stand, on their
pedestals.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#89:1>
Belpur was her home as much as anyone <w> else's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#90:1>
She had made a good choice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#91:1>
Destiny had arrived near the steps.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#92:1>
Mabel rode out on him towards the paddocks before making her way to
the teasing yard.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#93:1>
She surveyed the foals at foot clinging to their mothers and learning
to graze.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#94:1>
The pregnant mares were moving heavily in their elite sections.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#95:1>
The others were out in the vast, enclosed space, running with their
manes flying deliriously.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#96:1>
She felt exhilarated by the sights that sped past her, and the
sensation of power and speed under her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#97:1>
There were still ten mares in the queue by the time Mabel rode up
to the teasing yard.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#98:1>
It was a routine test, taken after two weeks, of the supervised
mating of the mares with highly prized studs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#99:1>
The vet was surprised by the unusual visit of Miss Dunne.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#100:1>
He got up to greet her but she signalled him to carry on.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#101:1>
A syce helped her down from Destiny.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#102:1>
She sat down on a chair they had brought out for her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#103:1>
The mares to be tested were being kept out of sight of the grey
midget stud, Don Emilio. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#104:1>
His lively tail was whisking up dust from the ground behind him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#105:1>
He looked pleased with his mane plaited with magenta and white
ribbons, the racing colours of Dunne-stable, <O> <&> page </&> 52 </O> 
tossing his head imperiously, impatiently pulling at the ropes which tied him
securely to two posts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#106:1>
Three mares were led in succession and proved to be pregnant as Don
Emilio showed no interest in them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#107:1>
Declared with foal at foot they were taken away with new respect by
their smiling syces, and the vet triumphantly put a tick against their names
on his pad.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#108:1>
He handed the pad to Mabel to see the earlier results.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#109:1>
She was congratulating him on the almost eighty percent success he
had achieved when she heard the <indig> Raja </indig> of Gawda wishing her
the time of day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#110:1>
When he introduced her to his son, Pratap, Mabel felt slightly
apprehensive about Lucy meeting him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#111:1>
His high forehead, wavy hair and sideburns made an attractive
setting for his almond-shaped eyes which, she thought, he must have
inherited from his mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#112:1>
Biceps peeping out of rolled up shirt sleeves, thrust of chest, and
the wide stance of long legs declared the pride of the owner in his
cultivated masculinity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#113:1>
He was alert, taking in the scene with a wide-angle sweep.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#114:1>
When Mabel explained Don <w> Emilio's </w> teasing exercise he
was immediately interested.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#115:1>
His attention became riveted on the next mare being led in.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#116:1>
The little stud stopped moving, stood stock still, entranced,
staring at the tall mare.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#117:1>
Slowly his penis stiffened and the red tip came out, longer and
longer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#118:1>
His body began to shiver uncontrollably.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#119:1>
He raised his front legs as high as he could.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#120:1>
The ropes tensed and held him helpless. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#121:1>
<quote> ` Is he never allowed to mate?' </quote> Pratap asked
Fali. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#122:1>
<quote> ` No, <w> he's </w> not meant for breeding' </quote>
Fali Mehta replied.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#123:1>
<quote> ` <w> He's </w> genetically inferior.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#124:1>
<quote> ` Poor chap , ' </quote> Pratap commiserated.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#125:1>
<quote> ` Not his fault, is it?' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#126:1>
The <indig> Raja </indig> was feeling self-conscious and
embarrassed by the whole operation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#127:1>
This was not the kind of place where a woman should allow hereself
to be.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#128:1>
He turned his back and asked Mabel if they could see the stables.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#129:1>
<quote> ` Why certainly,' </quote> Mabel replied.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#130:1>
<quote> ` Fali, will you please show them around?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#131:1>
<w> I'll </w> stay on here till the exercise is over and then go to
the office.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#132:1>
Bring them there when you finish .' </quote> </p> <O> <&> page </&>
53 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#133:1>
The <indig> Raja </indig> felt slighted.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#134:1>
Pratap wanted to stay on to watch the teasing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#135:1>
His father gave him a peremptory look and said to Mabel, ` <quote> `
<w> It's </w> very kind of you to allow us to visit, mabel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#136:1>
I can understand why you won't take another round after your visit
to the stables earlier in the day.' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#137:1>
<quote> ` Ay <*> dotted line</*> yes <*> dotted line </*> yes , '

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#138:1>

Would you like some tea or beer when you finish the round?' </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#141:1>
<w> Lucy's </w> head felt lumpy and her tongue had swollen and
filled her dry, bitter-tasting mouth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#142:1>
She tried to open her lips; they were like a rough elastic that
refused to stretch.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#143:1>
Her hand - - where was her hand?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#144:1>
Oh yes, right beside her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#145:1>
She moved the fingers and felt the cool sheet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#146:1>
Her arm felt like lead; in a little while <w> she'd </w> lift it.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#147:1>
Why should she get up?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#148:1>
What was there to be done by her, and her alone?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#149:1>
She could stay in bed and nobody would miss her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#150:1>
Mabel?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#151:1>
Mabel would.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#152:1>
Mabel must have peeped in and seen her dead to the world, left the
darkness undisturbed in the bedroom, shut the door quietly, and driven off to
her farm.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#153:1>
What time was it now?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#154:1>
Who cared?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#155:1>
Time just runs - - no purpose, no aim, just runs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#156:1>
Such things should be ignored. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#157:1>
The time had come to lift her hand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#158:1>
Now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#159:1>
No, <w> she'd </w> count five and then lift it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#160:1>
One, two, three ( must five come?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#161:1>
Slow it up ) <*> dotted line</*> er four <*> dotted line</*> hmm
five.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#162:1>
Lift. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#163:1>
She lifted her arm, brought the hand near the mouth, and worked
the lips with her fingers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#164:1>
Now they should open, and they did.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#165:1>
The tongue was stuck.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#166:1>
She sucked some air and waited for the saliva to wet the mouth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#167:1>
That was better.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#168:1>
She could move the tongue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#169:1>
It felt awaful.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#170:1>
Why did she take all this trouble to move it?

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#171:1>
Let it alone. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 54 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-014#172:1>
She lay still and projected herself into the room, into the
bungalow, into the birds and crows livening her windows ( ugh, the noise they
make ) , into the <indig> <it> mali </it> </indig> she could hear watering
the rose bushes outside, and down the slope into the farm house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-014#173:1>
She could imagine Mabel making her round, petting the horses in the
stables, checking the cleanliness, the feed, the health and happiness of
her animals. </p> </I>
