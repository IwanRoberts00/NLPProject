Good morning

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#2:1:A>
The main points <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#3:1:A>
The Bonn talks affirm <w> Germany's </w> right to reunification <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#4:1:A>

instensified <,>

The news in detail <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#7:1:A>
The Bonn talks on German reunification <,> have concluded affirming
<w> Germany's </w> right to be united <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#8:1:A>
The foreign ministers of the four victorious Allies of the Second
World War <,> and the two Germanies have endorsed the right of Germany <,> to
be united but there were differences whether united Germany should be a
member of <mention> NATO </mention> <,> or remain neutral <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#9:1:A>
In a joint declaration the foreign ministers of Soviet Union the
United States <,> Britain and France and the two Germanies <,> have set the
target for further consultations on the issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#10:1:A>
The first such meeting is to be held in June in East Berlin the
second in Paris in July <,> and the last one in Moscow in September this year
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#11:1:A>
Later speaking at a press conference Soviet Foreign Minister Mr
Schevernadze <,> expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks and said
Soviet Union <,> intends to work constructively <,> to accelarate the process
of German unity <,,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#X12:1:A>
This may be possible <,> after we <O> two words </O> <,> yeah I am
optimistically inclined <,,> I think we shall succeed <,> all over these
matters <,,> in finding <,> mutually acceptable solutions </X> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-001#13:1:A>
Mr Schevernadze however strongly opposed the <mention> NATO
</mention> membership <,> for the United Germany <,>

Second World War <,> should give serious consideration on issues relating to

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#X16:1:A>
But it is argued that this forum should take decisions <,,> only
on those issues relevant <,> to four power rights and responsibilities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#X17:1:A>
It is our view <,> that Germany <,> must not be singled out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#X18:1:A>
Thus many issues of significance interest to us here <,,> <w>
we'll </w> require consultation and decision <,> in other <,> more inclusive
forum </X> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-001#47:1:B>
If the development of art can be traced to the evaluation of
human consciousness <,> then every object of art reflects a social mileau <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#48:1:B>

A sporting event with no age limitation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#152:2:B>
The remote controlled model car rally had a turnout of twenty-two
participants <,,> ranging from a seven year old to adults <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#153:2:B>
The rally was held on the lines of regular off road ways <,> with
two category <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#154:2:B>
The hundred metre long track has speed breakers jumps <,> and
obstacles <,,>

The trasmitters of the participants had range of under hundred
feet <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#156:2:B>
And the participant guided his car <,> from a specially
constructed platform <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-001#157:2:B>

frequency <,,>

<,> the format of the race had to be changed <,,>

The participants ran their cars individually <,> and the person
recording the fastest time for three lapse <,> was adjudged the winner <,,>
