The three teenage students of Army Public School in Delhi
Cantonment are suspected to have fled from the Capital even as the South
West District police has sent a patrol party in their pursuit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#4:1>
The three girls Vandita Tiwari, Vishni Priya Datta and Dipali
Bhatia, all daughters of senior army officers have been missing from their
houses since Friday after they faced rough weather in the school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#5:1>
The police feel that the three girls had decided to face the world
on their own, in adventurous spirit.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#6:1>
Vandita the daughter of a Colonel had left behind a cryptic note which
was handed over to the police last night. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#7:1>
The note starts: <X> <quote> " I am going somewhere along with my
two <}> <-> girl friends </-> <+> girlfriends </+> </}> and there is no
boyfriend.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#X8:1>
Do not try to reach me and don't inform the police or else you will
face the consequences" </quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#9:1>
According to the police a police party armed with photographs of
the three girls has been despatched to Calcutta. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#10:1>
The police have some clues regarding their potential whereabouts.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#11:1>
However the South West district police have registered a case of
kidnapping. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#12:1>
There are indications that the girls, fed up with being badgered
in school and wanting to escape the cloistered life style had decided to make
out on their own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#13:1>
However the police is sparing no efforts to trace the girls
especially as they are in their teens and may fall into the clutches of wrong
elements. </p> </I>

<bold> <@PR> NAGPUR {#}, <@DR> Jan. 28 {#} :
- - The Prime Minister, Mr. Vishwanath Pratap Singh, today announced
that a detailed <quote> ' <indig> </w> Karjmukti </indig> ' </quote> scheme
relieving vast multitudes of farmers of debt burden will be presented during
coming Budget session of Parliament. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#33:5>
He was addressing a mammoth public meeting organised by <indig>
Shetkari Sanghatana </indig> at the historic <indig> Deekshabhoomi </indig>
here to mark the culmination of its 8000 km State wide <quote> ' <indig>
Vichar Yatra </indig> ' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#34:5>
Reiterating his <w> government's </w> commitment to the cause
of farmers, Mr. Singh said <quote> 'if power is like a sword, it will be used
in the interest of the farmers' </quote> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#35:5>
<h> <indig> Mukti </indig> , not <indig> Mafi </indig> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#36:5>
In response to <indig> Karj Mukti </indig> demand raised by
someone from the huge gathering, the Prime Minister said modalities are being
worked out and the detailed scheme will be presented during Budget session of
the Parliament scheduled to begin in the middle of March.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#37:5>
<X> <quote> " It will be a <indig> Karj Mukti </indig> scheme and not
<indig> Karj-mafi </indig> ( loan waiver) scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#X38:5>
It will relieve farmers of debt burden" </quote> </X> , he
clarified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#39:5>
The historic <indig> Deekshabhoomi </indig> was full to capacity
with volunteers of <indig> Shetkari Sanghatana </indig> from all over the
State and farmers from Vidarbha and adjoining Marathwada.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#40:5>
Mr. Vishwanath Pratap Singh, addressing the first ever public meeting
in the city as Prime Minister, did not disappoint the huge crowd.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#41:5>
He did not elaborate much on the proposals in the scheme probably due
to the constraints imposed on him after issue of notification for Assembly
elections in eight States. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#42:5>
<bold> He, however, categorically said that the scheme will be
framed in such a way that entire debt burden will be relieved, <quote> 'whatever
it may be, 12,000 <indig> crore </indig> , 14,000 <indig> crore </indig> or
16,000 <indig> crore </indig> , the government is committed' </quote> , he
said amidst thunderous response. </bold> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#43:5>
Mr. Singh listed measures already taken by his government to meet
two other demands of farmers - - remunerative prices to farm produce and
assured minimum wages to farm labourers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#44:5>
It has been decided to include minimum wages component, the factor
of price rise between the time of announcement of support price and the time
of actual harvesting of the crop and management cost, while fixing prices of
farm produce.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#45:5>
Inclusion of minimum wages while computing remunerative prices,
should avoid conflict between farmers and farm labourers, he said. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#46:5>
<h> Cotton export </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#47:5>
The decision to release quota of ten <indig> lakh </indig> cotton
bales for export in response to a demand by cotton growers, was also cited as
a step taken by his government in the interest of the farmers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#48:5>
Mr. Singh also announced that immediate instructions will be issued
to cancel orders for importing rice.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#49:5>
His attention towards rice import decision was drawn by Mr. Vijay
Jawandhia, Chairman of Kisan Coordination Committee comprising
representatives of farmers organisations all over the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#50:5>
Commenting on repeated reference to his attending the Kisan
Coordination Committee meeting in December last, the first Prime Minister
to do so, Mr. Singh said <quote> " when Prime Ministers address meetings of
traders organisations like FICCI and ASSOCHAM, why should he not go to KCC
meetings" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#51:5>
The Prime Minister also laid stress on the need to remove social
inequalities.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#52:5>
The decision to extend statutory reservations to neo-Buddhists was a
step in this direction, he observed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#53:5>
He was referring to Mandal Commission recommendations when someone
from the crowd raised the demand of <indig> Karjmukti </indig> diverting his
attention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#54:5>
In his speech lasting for about 30 minutes, Mr. Singh also
referred to the <quote> " one rank-one pension" </quote> demand of
ex-servicemen.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#55:5>
Stating that his government has already accepted it, Mr. Singh
observed <X> <quote> " I do not consider ex-servicemen as pensioners.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#X56:5>
They have a responsibility of frustrating designs of those trying to
create a communal divide in the society" </quote> </X> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#57:5>
The Prime Minister was earlier welcomed by <indig> Shetkari
Sanghatana </indig> leader Mr. Sharad Joshi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#58:5>
Mr. Joshi in his address lauded the steps taken by the Prime
Minister Mr. Singh in the interest of farmers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#59:5>
The <indig> Sanghatana </indig> leader hailed him ( Mr. Singh) as the
<quote> " messiah of farmers" </quote> , the only one after mythological King
<quote> 'Baliraja' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#60:5>
All other rulers, all these years have only exploited the farmers, he
remarked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#61:5>
Mr. Joshi said his prediction that 1989-90 would prove to be a
year of liberation of farmers, has come true.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#62:5>
The new Prime <w> Minister's </w> policy declaration at the meeting
of Kisan Coordination Committee on December 31 last has given enough
indication of coming change.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#63:5>
<X> <quote> " Never before in the history, farmers had such a good
opportunity liberating themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#X64:5>
But at this crucial juncture, certain forces are trying to create a
communal divide.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#X65:5>
In the name of Ayodhya temple or on some other pretext, they want to
create a rift in the society and bring back the caste system based on
exploitation," </quote> </X> the <indig> Sanghatana </indig> leader said
sounding a warning.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#66:5>
He appealed to farmers to frustrate any such move. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#67:5>
The <indig> Sanghatana </indig> leader assured on behalf of
farmers that every effort would be made to raise farm output provided the
farmer is given his due.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#68:5>
<quote> " To express gratitude to the nation, he will toil to
increase agricultural production from the coming season" </quote> , Mr. Joshi
said amidst applause. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#69:5>
Union Minister, Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, in his speech, appealed to
<indig> Dalits </indig> in Maharashtra to join the forces committed to
bring about social justice end equality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#70:5>
Kisan Coordination Committee Chairman, Mr. Vijay Jawandhiya
appealed to the Prime Minister to concede the demand of remunerative prices
to farm produce so that the farmers would be in a position to return the crop
loan and live with dignity.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#71:5>
<indig> Shetkari Sanghatana </indig> Maharashtra State Unit
President, Mr. Shankar Dhondge conducted the proceedings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-007#72:5>
The <indig> Sanghatana <quote> " Vichar Yatra" </quote> </indig>
function concluded with an oath administered to farmers by <indig> Sanghatana
</indig> leader Sharad Joshi.

<ICE-IND:W2C-007#73:5>
With their fists raised, the farmers took a pledge to work for
one-point demand of remunerative prices to farm produce without giving any
consideration to communal and caste differences. </p> </I>
