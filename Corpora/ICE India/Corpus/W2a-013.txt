development in the field of audit of financial institutions, especially

All items of revenue and expenditure are scanned, leakages and
abnormalities, if any, are detected and corrective measures taken.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#7:1>
Further, it is ensured that only legitimate charges are passed on to
clients and they are not unnecessarily penalised.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#8:1>
Thus, the entire audit focus is on revenue.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#9:1>
Being a specialised type of audit it casts certain responsibilities
which auditors are supposed to fulfil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#10:1>
The aspects which are to be looked into while conducting the audit
are briefly touched upon in this paper.

The names given to various books / registers and the contents
therein may change according to the needs, circumstances and policy of the
bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#25:1>
A brief summary of the procedure to be followed in conducting
the revenue audit is enumerated below.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#26:1>
Firstly, the items of expenditure are dealt with. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#27:1>
<h> <bold> Savings Deposit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#28:1>
It is maintained by small earners.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#29:1>
There are certain restrictions on the number of withdrawals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#30:1>
Presently two withdrawals per week, i.e. maximum eight in a month are
allowed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#31:1>
Care should be taken while conducting the audit that this norm is
adhered to.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#32:1>
If not, the policy of the bank on this matter is to be seen.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#33:1>
As per RBI notification presently 5 % interest is paid on the minimum
balance between the 1Oth and 30th ( or 31st ) day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#34:1>
Cooperative banks usually pay 1 % more than the rate prescribed by
RBI.

lnterest is paid half-yearly during December and June, i.e. for the
period June to November in the month of December and for the period
December to May in the month of June. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#36:1>
The minimum balance between the 1Oth and 30th day of each month
is noted and the product for half yearly period is calculated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#37:1>
To this product the applicable rate is applied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#38:1>
It is easier to calculate the interest, if, first the interest on one
rupee for one month is calculated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#39:1>
Half-yearly interest can be easily calculated by multiplying the
product with the amount of interest so calculated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#40:1>
If the cheques, if any, are returned without clearance it should be
noted that cheque return charges is applied. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#41:1>

The amount payable is the difference between the quarterly interest
payable and the interest paid earlier for the broken period.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#56:1>
( Broken period means the number of days from the date of deposit
till the end of the quarter ) .

This number is to be seen in a particular fixed deposit ledger
wherein are given all the necessary details.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#62:1>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#120:1>
First obtain the details pertaining to salaries.

earlier year and the reason(s) behind the variation should be seen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#130:1>
<h> <bold> Audit Procedure </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#131:1>
<h> <bold> Steps </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#132:1>
1) See the muster, test-check in the case of few employees the
number of days he was present.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#133:1>
If the employee is absent see whether the leave is with pay or
without pay.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#134:1>
If it is with pay, then salary will be paid even for the leave
period and vice-versa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#135:1>
2) Check the amount of basic pay, compare it with earlier
period, notice variation(s) if any and obtain the reasons justifying the
variation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#136:1>
Calculate DA ( fixed and variable ) as per the formula given.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#137:1>
Calculate the various allowances that are payable to the employee.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#138:1>
3) Verify whether the total gross salary payable to all
employees is debited to profit and loss account, and deductions, if any,
therefrom, are properly recorded in the respective account. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#139:1>
4) See whether signature of the employees is obtained on the
salary sheets on revenue stamp. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#140:1>
5) Verify whether the salary and allowances payable is duly
sanctioned by the competent authority. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#141:1>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#143:1>
Verify the major items of expenditure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#144:1>
See that no item of expenditure of capital nature is charged to
profit and loss account.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#145:1>
If any capital expenditure is shown as revenue then the same
should be rectified. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-013#146:1>
<h> <bold> Rent and Taxes </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#147:1>

If there is any variation with the rent paid for earlier years, the
reasons justifying the same should be seen.

<ICE-IND:W2A-013#150:1>
If it is the first year of procuring the charge of premises then the
