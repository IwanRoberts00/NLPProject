<ICE-IND:W1B-002#2:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#3:1>
Reached here on Friday morning and enquired after Prin.  
Bhogishayana. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#4:1>
He had been out of station. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#5:1>
He returned day before yesterday. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#6:1>
I saw him yesterday and gave your letter <indig> Shri </indig>  
Sushilkumar is coming here on the 2<sp>nd</sp> Dec., at which time Prin.  
Bhogishayana will talk about your work to Sushilkumar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#7:1>
<w> He'll </w> then give you a letter of introduction to Sushilkumar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#8:1>
As soon as I will get the letter, I will send the same to you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#9:1>
During this stay of mine in Kolhapur, I was happy that I could do  
some writing. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#10:1>
I could get a pretty clear idea of the writing-style, which was a  
problem before me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#11:1>
I am also overwhelmed with the keen interest you took in the work;  
particularly, that you came to the Dept. and found out the books for me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#12:1>
I promise you to try my level best to match your efforts. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#13:1>
You look and are, all right in your health, but I feel a little  
anxious. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#14:1>
You looked rather tired, when I left you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#15:1>
Kindly take care that you do not overwork yourself, physically as  
well as mentally. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#16:1>
As per the present plan, I will come to Kolhapur on the  
17<sp>th</sp> Dec. at which time I will bring with me the completed point on  
Communication skill-teaching and testing. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#17:1>
The College reopens from tomorrow, and I wonder how I am going to  
find time and peace of mind to concentrate on the work. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#18:1>
Kindly convey my regards to Mrs. Shastri and compliments to the  
younger generation(s). </p>

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#22:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#23:1>
I met Prin. Bhogishayana again this morning and enquired if he  
could talk to Mr. Sushilkumar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#24:1>
He told me that though he was <del> along </del> with him at two /  
three programmes, this time, because it is the election time, Sushilkumar was  
always so crowded with the political aspirants, that he could not get an  
appointment to open this topic with him. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#25:1>
Bhogishayana, however told me that he will write immediately to  
Mr. Sushilkumar on his Delhi address about your work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#26:1>
He may also write to you and give you the letter of introduction to  
Mr. Shinde. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#27:1>
He also suggested that you might proceed with your plan, writing to  
Mr. Sushilkumar Shinde on his Delhi address - - Gen. Secretary, AICC,  
Jantar-Mantar Road New Delhi or personally seeing him in Delhi or Kop. or  
anywhere giving reference to Prin. <w> Bhogishayana's </w> having written to  
him in regard to your work, without waiting for his letter of introduction to  
you to Mr. Shinde. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#28:1>
He promised to immediately write <del> ing </del> to Mr. Shinde and  
expressed confidence that your work will then be done promptly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#29:1>
My good offices with Mr. Shinde may also come of some use to you.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#30:1>
For my <w> mother's </w> <indig> ` Varshashraddha' </indig> I am  
coming to Kop. from 16<sp>th</sp> Dec. to 20<sp>th</sp> Dec., at which, with  
telephoning you <}> <-> priorly, </-> <+> previously </+> </}> I will come to  
see you with the remaining part of Ch.1 on Communication-skill Model. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#31:1>
By second week of Jan. my Ch.2 on <quote> ` cloze' </quote> will be  
ready. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#32:1>
As per your proposed plan, you may have been leaving for Bombay on  
10<sp>th</sp> for tape-recording Meeting. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#33:1>
Wish you success. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#34:1>

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#38:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#39:1>
You might have received two of my earlier letters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#40:1>
As I have stated in my second letter, though Prin. Bhogishayana  
couldn't personally talk to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde, during his visit  
hence on the 2<sp>nd</sp> and 3<sp>rd</sp>, as promised by Prin.  
Bhogishayana, he has written to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde about your work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#41:1>
You may, therefore, as per his suggestion, proceed with your plan of  
either writing to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde or seeing him personally. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#42:1>
I, however, am trying to get from him a letter of introduction to  
<indig> Shri </indig> Shinde as per our original idea. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#43:1>
Unfortunately, as he ( i.e. Prin. Bhogishayana ) is always busy, I  
couldn't find him <ul> <quote> ` at home' </quote> </ul> . </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#44:1>
Last Tuesday, my father, when he had gone out for his routine  
<quote> ` walking' </quote> , feeling giddy, fell down in the street, and  
since then is ailing rather seriously, requiring a lot of nursing, which none  
but I have to do. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#45:1>
My wife also is required to go to Pune, Kolhapur etc. <del> for  
</del> on domestic duties. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#46:1>
As such, I am unable to leave Solapur for the time being. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#47:1>
I hope that I will be able to come to Kolhapur in the first week of  
Jan. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#48:1>
Till then I will try to complete the remaining part of Ch. 1. (  
Communication Model ) and Ch. 2 on Cloze Procedure, though proper leisure - -  
both physically and mentally - - is not available. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#49:1>
However, I am <}> <-> determin<del>g</del>e </-> <+> determined </+>  
</}> to complete the work in any case before May 1995 end. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#50:1>
Kindly therefore, understanding my present inability, bear with me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#51:1>
An occasional time in reply will be quite soothing. The rest is O.K. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#52:1>
Convey my regards to Mrs. Shastri, and love to children. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#53:1>

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#57:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#58:1>
Received your letter dated 19 . 12 on Friday, the 23<sp>rd</sp>. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#59:1>
Accordingly on Saturday, I talked to prin. Bhogishayana and  
communicated to him your request about his giving to you a letter of  
introduction to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#60:1>
I also told him of your going to Delhi on the 6<sp>th</sp> and  
7<sp>th</sp> of Jan. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#61:1>
His reaction was that he has already passed the information to  
<indig> Shri </indig> Shinde through his Solapur liason <indig> Shri </indig>  
Vishnupant Kothe <*> the character ` K' is overwritten </*> and that by this  
time <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde might have done all that is needful. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#62:1>
Therefore, he didn't see any need to give any letter of introduction. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#63:1>
Moreover, <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde, there being busy election  
days, may not be available in Delhi at the time you go there. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#64:1>
His advice <*> ` c' in ` advice' is overwritten </*> is that you  
directly see the Parliamentary Secretary and the work would be done. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#65:1>
His advice is quite sound and he must have communicated the  
matter to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde; but to add to it, if you really  
happen to meet <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde, you may make <del> of </del> use  
of my letter also. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#66:1>
I am sure, that if Shinde hears of my name, he will look into the  
matter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#67:1>
Therefore, uninvitedly, I have put alongwith this letter, my letter  
to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde about your work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#68:1>
If it helps you, well and good. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#69:1>
I, however, wish you success in <-> this </-> every endeavour of  
yours. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#70:1>
Kindly write to me after you return from Delhi. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#71:1>
Hope you have gone through the pages I left with you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#72:1>
My father not well as yet; in fact worsened. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#73:1>
He is admitted to the hospital; but I hope, he will get on well,  
soon. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#74:1>
The rest is all <}> <-> allright </-> <+> alright </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#79:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#80:1>
As per your earlier letter ( dt. 19 . 12 .94 ) , you were to go  
to Delhi on the 6<sp>th</sp> and 7<sp>th</sp> of this month. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#81:1>
I hope, you did go and come back from there, the mission, successful ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#82:1>
Did you receive my letter, probably dated 27<sp>th</sp> Dec. 94,  
conveying you Prin. <w> Bhogishayana's </w> message and also accompanying my  
own letter addressed to <indig> Shri </indig> Shinde. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#83:1>
I am very doubtful, you could see Shinde, looking to the present  
political unrest; but alongwith the OUP work ( ? ) you must also have got a  
clearance from the Parliamentary Secretary for making use of the telecast  
deliberations in the parliament. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#84:1>
It must have been very cold in Delhi these days ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#85:1>
How did you manage yourself before the same ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#86:1>
How is your health now ? </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#87:1>
My father is a little better off now; he can move about. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#88:1>
But his sugar is pretty high; and with his present state of health,  
it is difficult for me to move out. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#89:1>
My College Annual Prize distribution is there tomorrow. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#90:1>
That will free me of many of my encumbrances. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#91:1>
By the end of this month maximum by the end of the first week of Feb.  
I will shed off all my teaching <del> work </del> responsibility. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#92:1>
I have now completed the <mention> Communication Skill Approach  
</mention> of the Chapter I 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#93:1>
I plan to come to Kop., in the first week of Feb., alongwith my  
progress report and Fee ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#94:1>
There after, I will be fully available for the work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#95:1>
Kindly write me back a line or two at your convenience. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#96:1>
I am arranging ( trying - - without much certainty ) for getting  
myself re-employed in an unaided College - - which would take me possibly for  
another five years - - hence Ph.D. would be not much out of relevance ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#97:1>
Moreover, P.G. teaching also will continue for five more years. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#98:1>
Nothing is, however certain, and it never is. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#99:1>
The rest is Okay. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#100:1>
How about you & yours ? </p>

Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#105:1>
Received the proforma you prepared for the <quote> ` Release

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#106:1>
I have fixed Monday, the 5<sp>th</sp> Feb. as a day for them to  
write their essays. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#107:1>
Imperfections are bound to be there in the execution of the scheme. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#108:1>
It will be around the 10<sp>th</sp> of Feb. for me to send them to  
you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#109:1>
I had been to Pune & Bombay from 27<sp>th</sp> to 31<sp>st</sp>  
Jan. and have returned from Bombay only yesterday morning after seeing off  
Milind. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#110:1>
In two-three days, my daughter-in-law with my granddaughter will  
come here for about a <w> month's </w> stay, the granddaughter keeping me  
busy for all that time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#111:1>
We all plan to come to Kop. around 17<sp>th</sp> to 20<sp>th</sp>  
Feb. to see all our relatives there. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#112:1>
I don't think Mrs. Upalani has given the right consideration to  
the equivalence <del> correction </del> ratio formula. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#113:1>
It is not the regular<del>tion</del> correlation between two scales. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#114:1>
Within the same scale, with the large number, the ratio is bound to  
go high up. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#115:1>
The mischief is with the m/m-1 = 10/9. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#116:1>
With this factor the quotient is bound to go high. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#117:1>
There is nothing more in our data or calculation; probably the  
formula is inapplicable. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#118:1>
We may drop the idea of applying it or may take it to some other  
expert 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#119:1>
There is no relation between this and the <ul> 30 + 21 </ul>  
division of Com. students, because this computing of S.D. is for all 51  
students. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#120:1>
Moreover the results are stable for all the facilities. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#121:1>
<ul> 30 + 21 </ul> division concerns only with M<sb>1</sb>,  
M<sb>2</sb>, M<sb>3</sb>, M<sb>4</sb> correlation, which is a minor matter  
done at EDP ( Tata ) . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#122:1>
Cloze M<sb>1</sb> M<sb>2</sb> M<sb>3</sb> M<sb>4</sb> correlation  
have been worked out at Shivaji Computer Centre for all 51. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#123:1>
The fact is that you have not really gone through the data and you  
pick up something seemingly wrong and get the thing blocked there. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#124:1>
The <quote> ` post-test' </quote> was done on Sunday the  
28<sp>th</sp>. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#125:1>
The calculations will be ready soon. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#126:1>
The error of ( 30 + 21 ) , if it is so ( pointed out now, after 9  
years ! ) is being corrected. </p>

11-B Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413 004 August 6, 1996. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#152:1>
Dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-002#153:1>
On Sunday the 21<sp>st</sp> July, as per your suggestion I  
phoned you up around 3.30 p.m., hoping you to have returned from Sangli and  
Miraj. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#154:1>
As the telephone only rang and nobody lifted it, I think, you had  
not come back. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-002#155:1>
Later, as I got a message from Solapur of the sudden and unexpected  
death of my dear friend and next door neighbour Prof. D.S. Dalal ( Phone No.  
611079 ) under accident, I rushed to Solapur and couldn't phone you later.  
</p>
