<I> <O> Q.2 a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#1:1>
Fishing in India is very limited though India has long <}> <->
cost </-> <+> coast </+> </}> line.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#2:1>
<w> India's </w> contribution towards fishing is not even 6 % because
mainly India is <+> a </+> tropical country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#3:1>
In this area fishing activity is very limited because <-> there are
</-> no importance is given to fishing activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#4:1>
But today fishing activity is also developed because of fishing
bank.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#5:1>
In many areas such as fishing bank is developed <ul> e.g. </ul> Grand
Bank. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#6:1>
Fishing is developed in that area 1) <}> <-> very </-> <+> where
</+> </}> <?> part </?> and planktons are <}> <-> avaliable </-> <+>
available </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#7:1>
But in tropics this is not <}> <-> possiable </-> <+> possible. </+>
</}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#8:1>
2) <?> pan </?> and planktons are growing in water because they are
the food of fish<del>n</del>.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#9:1>
If this <-> is </-> grows on large scale then fishing activity is
developed on large scale.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#10:1>
3) Growing planktons in <del> fishies is </del> water is not
developed in tropical areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#11:1>
4) In tropical areas there <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> people
who <del> were </del> do not eat fish or consume fish or if they <del> are
</del> consume fish on <-> a </-> certain days.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#12:1>
So the activity of fishing is very poorly developed in <}> <-> tropic
</-> <+> tropical </+> </}> areas but in other areas there is no problem
about consumption of fish

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#13:1>
5) In tropics Government is not giving finance to <}> <-> fisherman
</-> <+> fishermen </+> </}> like <del> to </del> <}> <-> build </-> <+>
buiding </+> </}> ships or <+> provide </+> nets etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#14:1>
</w> Government's </w> contribution towards fishing activity is very
poor.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#15:1>
6) In <}> <-> tropic </-> <+> tropical </+> </}> areas fisherman has
no communication facility.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#16:1>
So there is always a problem to fisherman to go and catch fish. </p>

<I> <O> C) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#17:2>
Animal farming is more developed in that area where <del> of
</del> more grass <}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+> </}> available for animals.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#18:2>
Therefore India started to grow grass on a large scale.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#19:2>
In <}> <-> Austrialia grean </-> <+> Australia green </+> </}> grass,
<}> <-> read </-> <+> red </+> </}> grass, <}> <-> bule </-> <+> blue </+>
</}> grass, Alfa-Alfa grass is available

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#20:2>
So in that area animal farming is developed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#21:2>
<del> In </del> New Zealand is <-> compared to </-> near South
pole.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#22:2>
So in that area rain is <}> <-> plantly </-> <+> plenty </+> </}> <->
are </-> in that area grass is growing on continuously, people also <del>
creat </del> develop in that grass because they know if grass is available
then the animals <del> is </del> become fat.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#23:2>
In <}> <-> Newzeland </-> <+> New Zealand </+> </}> mountainous area
is more, so they <del> are </del> do not grow farms but only <+> grow grass
<del> on </del> for sheep in that area <+> so that they </+> become fat and
<del> catching </del> <w> there's </w> more demand for mutton <del> market
</del> but wool <del> an </del> of the <}> <-> ship </-> <+> sheep </+> </}>
is very low quality. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#24:2>
But as compared to <}> <-> Austrialia </-> <+> Australia </+>
</}> that is <del> long </del> to south pole so in that area rain is not in
<}> <-> plantly </-> <+> plenty </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#25:2>
So in that area grass is available on <del> middle </del> limited
quantity, but the<del>re</del> grass is very low quality as compared to <}>
<-> Newzeland </-> <+> New Zealand </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#26:2>
So sheep in <}> <-> that </-> <+> those </+> </}> areas are not very
fat <-> to </-> and <w> there's </w> more demand on mutton <del> market
</del> but wool they have is very good quality.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#27:2>
So <}> <-> they are </-> <+> there is </+> </}> demand for wool
market. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#28:3>
Indian trade in olden days <}> <-> where </-> <+> was </+> </}>
very poor in the British days.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#29:3>
Britishers <+> did </+> not develop tr<del>e</del>ade with any other
<}> <-> country. </-> <+> countries </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#30:3>
<del> h </del> They developed trade only with <}> <-> Grate Britan
</-> <+> Great Britain </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#31:3>
They <del> em </del> export raw materials from India and imported
<del> fished </del> finished goods to India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#32:3>
But nowadays India developed<del>is</del> its <+> own </+>
trading activities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#33:3>
But India has very limited trade with <}> <-> his </-> <+> its </+>
</}> neighbours.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#34:3>
<}> <-> India trade with sea </-> <+> Indian sea trade </+> </}> is
also developed because India has very long <}> <-> cost </-> <+> coast </+>
</}> line.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#35:3>
India has not much developed trade with <}> <-> Paktshan </-> <+>
Pakistan </+> </}> , Bangladesh etc because <}> <-> India </-> <+> <w>
India's </w> </+> </}> sea water transport is not very developed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#36:3>
India developed its trade by land<del>way</del>, road<del>way</del>,
or Rail<del>way</del>. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#37:3>
India <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> very limited trade with
<}> <-> neighouring </-> <+> neighbouring </+> </}> countries that is <+> the
</+> main problem is that India <+> has </+> not developed trade with English
speaking countries.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#38:3>
But India <}> <-> nowaday tried </-> <+> now-a-days trying </+> </}>
to develop trade with English speaking countries such as <}> <-> canda </->
<+> Canada </+> </}> , America etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#39:3>
India exports raw material like <}> <-> cotten </-> <+> cotton </+>
</}> , oil seeds etc, and import machinery electric <del> s</del> material
etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#40:3>
But today India also exports machinery, coal of good quality etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#41:3>
But compared to neighbouring countries like Pakisthan, Bangladesh
India is very poor with this country because of <}> <-> reglious </-> <+>
religious </+> </}> , language barrier. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.3 a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#42:4>
Industry is the activity of second order, primary products are
not storable or transportable so they wants to convert this <del> pord </del>
product into fishined products so industry <del> is </del> takes place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#43:4>
Industry is based on many factors such as, capital, raw
materials, demand and market for <}> <-> porducts </-> <+> products </+> </}>
transport facilities etc., as capital or raw mterials <}> <-> is </-> <+> are
</+> </}> important to start an Industry.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#44:4>
Power is also very important for Industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#45:4>
In olden days man used his own man power to produce a particular
type of product or they used animal power.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#46:4>
But in those days production <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}> very
limited as population <}> <-> is very few </-> <+> was small </+> </}> the
wants of people <}> <-> is </-> <+> were </+> </}> also very few and they <}>
<-> are </-> <+> were </+> </}> fulfilled by them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#47:4>
But in these days we use many machinery and to employ<del>ee</del>
machinery power is necessary.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#48:4>
So we use <}> <-> electerity </-> <+> electricity </+> </}> but <}>
<-> electircity </-> <+> electricity </+> </}> is also very limited so we
used coal to produce power for industry.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#49:4>
In olden days coal <}> <-> is </-> <+> was of </+> </}> very good
quality and on burning coal is given very high quantity of heat.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#50:4>
So on that industry <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}> run.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#51:4>
But on burning, coal <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}> also given as
a<del>l</del>sh, so that is the problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#52:4>
But in India coal of good quality is not available

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#53:4>
Coal in India gives very less amount of heat for industry and very
more amount of a<del>l</del>sh this is the <del> very </del> problem in
India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#54:4>
But <del> today </del> electricity <+> as a </+> resource <}> <-> are
</-> <+> is </+> </}> not <del> very good </del> more quantity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#55:4>
So coal is used in olden days <+> industrial </+> activity is <del> b
</del> fulfilled by using coal. So <del> s</del> coal is the <quote> ` Black
Gold' </quote> for industry. </p> </I>


<I> <O> b) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#56:5>
Rivers of <}> <-> penisular </-> <+> peninsular </+> </}> India
of little use of navigation because of following reason - -

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#57:5>
1) Rivers in India <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> dry in summer.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#58:5>
So they are <+> not </+> useful for navigation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#59:5>
They dry in summer, <+> and it </+> is full of water in rainy season,
so navigation is impossible.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#60:5>
2) <?> Conner </?> of river is not <del> a flat </del> smooth area.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#61:5>
There are some waterfalls <?> waterlips </?> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#62:5>
So nav<del>e</del>igation is not possible.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#63:5>
3<)> <?> Conners </?> of rivers <del> in </del> <+> do </+> not match
for navigation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#64:5>
4) Government contribution is not for <w> rivers' </w> navigation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#65:5>
There is no point for navigation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#66:5>
Government or semi-Government <+> does </+> not give amount or any
financial help to those rivers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#67:5>
5) In rivers, there is no point <}> <-> for </-> <+> in </+> </}>
loading.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#68:5>
Loading means, that is, goods or <}> <-> pansanger </-> <+>
passangers </+> </}> loading.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#69:5>
There is such a point for this or any facility for this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#70:5>
So navigation of peninsular <+> in </+> India is <+> of </+> very
little use. </p> </I>


<I> <O> c) </O> <&> This essay has been scored out by the candidate </&> <O>
d) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#71:6>
As soon as ma<del>i</del>n appeared on the surface of the earth
he started <del> se </del> re<del>u</del> se<del>s</del>arching for
hi<del>m</del>s <}> <-> Enivernoment </-> <+> Environment </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#72:6>
Then he found that his <}> <-> Enivernoment </-> <+> Environment </+>
</}> or surroundings could provide him valuable material to satisfy his
needs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#73:6>
As there <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> living things there <}>
<-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> non-living things also in the surroundings

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#74:6>
Living things such as plants <del> aim </del> animals, insects etc.,
and nonliving <+> things </+> like rivers, <del> plan </del> mountains etc.,
<del> as said that mounsantain is the exporters at people. </del> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#75:6>
On mountain there is no possibility for man to do his main
activity because there is no flat land available for doing some <}> <->
activity </-> <+> acivities </+> </}> such as farming, animal farming etc.,

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#76:6>
As there is no <}> <-> flate </-> <+> flat </+> </}> land is <}> <->
avilable </-> <+> available </+> </}> there is facility like transport;
industry etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#77:6>
In that area rain is also limited so <}> <-> filled </-> <+> field
</+> </}> farming is also not developed <-> also </-> there is less of
industry so there is less at job <del> or </del> <}> <-> apportiunity </->
<+> opportunity </+> </}> or employment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#78:6>
So people on that area say that <del> G </del> there is no job <}>
<-> apportinuity </-> <+> opportunities </+> </}> and also Government does
not provide any help to them or <del> Gov </del> they are <}> <-> negalected
</-> <+> neglected </+> </}> by people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#79:6>
So they started to come on <}> <-> commerical </-> <+> commercial
</+> </}> area </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#80:6>
<del> So </del> that is why mountain is exporters of people. </p>

<I> <O> Q.5 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#81:7>
Cultural <}> <-> enivronment </-> <+> environment </+> </}> is
the <}> <-> enivronment </-> <+> environment </+> </}> created by man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#82:7>
Man is the most important <+> one </+> in the <}> <-> eniveronment
</-> <+> environment </+> </}> because he is the <}> <-> entiglient </-> <+>
intelligent </+> </}> animal of all. He has created his own <}> <->
enironment </-> <+> environment </+> </}> and in fact he <}> <-> do </-> <+>
did </+> </}> so but other animals cannot do so

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#83:7>
So man is growing importance towards the <}> <-> enironment </->
<+> environment </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#84:7>
Man can change or modify his <}> <-> enivernoment </-> <+>

environment </+> </}> as <del> compare </del> he wants or <}> <-> sutiable

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#85:7>
So man is the most <}> <-> inteligent </-> <+> intelligent </+> </}>
or main part of the <}> <-> enivironment </-> <+> environment </+> </}> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#86:7>
As ma<del>i</del>n is the most important <+> animal </+> in the
environment he <del> is create </del> influences on human <}> <-> activies
</-> <+> activities </+> </}> there is always a difference between <}> <->
reglious </-> <+> different religions </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#87:7>
Man of different <}> <-> reglious </-> <+> religions </+> </}>
creates problems.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#88:7>
<del> n </del> In India there is <del> very </del> <}> <-> more </->
<+> a big </+> </}> population, of different <}> <-> reglious </-> <+>
religions </+> </}> Hindu, <}> <-> Muslium christan </-> <+> Muslim,
Christian </+> </}> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#89:7>
<}> <-> christans </-> <+> Christians </+> </}> consume fish but
<del> m th </del> many of some type; they consume fish on <-> a </-> very
limited days or limited months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#90:7>
language is also a barrier as in India many type of <}> <-> man
</-> <+> men </+> </}> live so language is also different.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#91:7>
English speaking or marathi <+> speaking </+> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#92:7>
But Hindi is a Government language <}> <-> Marthi </-> <+> Marathi
</+> </}> is comman language and English is a <}> <-> commerical </-> <+>
commercial </+> </}> language in India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#93:7>
In India many <}> <-> reglious </-> <+> religious </+> </}> ideas
<-> is </-> grow as people <}> <-> ie </-> <+> are </+> </}> Hindus.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#94:7>
There is no importance of bread <+> making </+> activity and also
people want fresh <del> m </del> food material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#95:7>
There is also a problem that in olden days people <+> did </+>
not send <del> go </del> to <del> the </del> women to any <}> <-> where. </->
<+> place. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#96:7>
So there <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}> only man to do work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#97:7>
Women work at <-> a </-> house but in other countries women get white
<del> colour </del> collar job.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#98:7>
women <-> is </-> also work with man and <del> they </del> help to
nation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#99:7>
There is also some political factor which also influences on
cultural <}> <-> enivronment </-> <+> environment </+> </}> such as
Government semi-Government <del> et </del> private companies etc. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.7 a) </O>

<h> <ul> Social forestry </ul> - - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#101:8>
For a very long time in U.S.A and <}> <-> Canda </-> <+> Canada
</+> </}> <del> much </del> more importance <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}>
given to <}> <-> commerical </-> <+> commercial </+> </}> forestry means
which gives food, raw material, or any other resources. These plants or
forest is only growing, that means they grow <del> co </del> important
trees only.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#102:8>
this is <}> <-> commerical </-> <+> commercial </+> </}> development
of forestry.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#103:8>
<}> <-> scientics </-> <+> Scientists </+> </}> are very much <}>
<-> afried </-> <+> afraid </+> </}> about this one sided development.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#104:8>
They thought that this is not correct <}> <-> people </-> <+>
practice </+> </}> also grow any other <del> r </del> plants which <}> <-> is
</-> <+> are </+> </}> not <}> <-> commerical </-> <+> commercially </+> </}>
developed <del> effect on </del> otherwise there is an effect <}> <-> of </->

etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#105:8>
So they started to develop social forestry also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#106:8>
This is more important to <del> human </del> man because soil <}>
<-> erogin </-> <+> erosion </+> </}> or pollution is a major problem to man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#107:8>
<del> so </del> They do not work on <}> <-> filed </-> <+> fields
</+> </}> due to soil- <}> <-> erogin </-> <+> erosion </+> </}> but if
social forestry is developed there is no fear about soil <}> <-> erogion </->
<+> erosion </+> </}> etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#108:8>
In olden days India <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}> famous for
making wooden article or toy making article of wood etc., but today there is
no demand for these because wood is not available for making these articles.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#109:8>
Also there is demand for food resources <}> <-> like </-> <+>
because </+> </}> forests provide us very important resources.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#110:8>
But this is not <}> <-> possiable </-> <+> possible </+> </}> today
because of deforestation of forests. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#111:8>
There is food for animal from forests but this is also not <}>
<-> possiable </-> <+> possible </+> </}> because forest is not on a very
large scale

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#112:8>
So scientists said that grow forests.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#113:8>
In India there <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> bare hills or
mountains or roads.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#114:8>
So grow <}> <-> threr </-> <+> their </+> </}> plants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#115:8>
If in roadway we grow various <del> try </del> types of plants <}>
<-> is </-> <+> it </+> </}> is more beautiful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#116:8>
We grow plants on road side, we grow plants like <}> <-> Gulmore
</-> <+> Gulmohar </+> </}> - - beautiful flowers, fruit so they <-> are </->
attracted by <}> <-> torusit </-> <+> tourists </+> </}> and birds. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#117:9>
<ul> Influence of man on plant environment </ul>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-012#118:9>
Since man is knowing about his surroundings or Environment,
as soon as he appears on the earth he started searching of <+> his </+>
surroundings.

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#119:9>
That his surroundings or <}> <-> Enivnonment </-> <+> Environment

history of ma<del>i</del>nkind <del> is an as old as the history of earth.
</del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-012#120:9>
His surroundings could give him living as well as non-living
