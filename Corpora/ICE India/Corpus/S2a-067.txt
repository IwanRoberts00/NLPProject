Tampure </@> and <,> P M notes <.> ex </.> at exhibit fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#55:1:A>
According to the learned special P P <,,> the death was caused by
uh <,,> haemorrhage and shock <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#56:1:A>
Therefore it was unnatural <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#57:1:A>

was perforated <,,> uh was uh <,> eh has perforated the wall of the <,>
abdomen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#60:1:A>
That is the reason why there was uh <,> Haematoma on both the

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#66:1:A>

number one two <,> and three as there are uh <,,> from the same locality <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#79:1:A>
Therefore there cannot be <,> mistaken identity <,,>

It was not a sudden sudden quarrel <,,>

Two parties <,,> at the outset were also <,> separated by P W

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#85:1:A>
He has also <,,> canvassed before this court that the <,,> offence

brought a knife <,,> caught hold <.> o </.> caught hold uh <,,> caught hold
of <,> the deceased by his uh <,> one hand <,,> and pressed the neck of the

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#86:1:A>
He has also canvassed before before this court that there is no
time <,,> to connect the uh <,> <.> sto </.> uh to concoct the story <,>
because P W numbers uh <,,> two and three <,> came on the scene of offence
after hearing the shouts <,,> after hearing the shouts <,> caught hold uh

The learned special P P has also canvassed before this court that
the <,> the blood group <,,> of the deceased <,,> could not be proved <,,> as
uh <,,> C A could not uh give the conclusive uh <,,> conclusive evidence <,,>
and uh <,> the same the blood uh <,> the blood file which was sent <,,> to
the chemical analyser <,,> of which the result shows <,,> inconclusive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#94:1:A>
The blood group of the accused appears to be <,,> of O group <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#95:1:A>
It also appears on articles <,> one two and three <,,> <O> cough
</O> the same blood of group O was <,> also found on the above said uh <,,>
articles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#96:1:A>
The blood found on articles one two and three <,> and article five
<,,> is also uh <,> is also the same <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#97:1:A>
If the blood of uh the blood group of O was also found article five
<,,> then it fixes the liability <,> of the accused <,,> that the accused had
<,> accused and the accused has only <,> committed <,,> the offence in the
instance case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#98:1:A>
Therefore the learned uh <,,> special P P has canvassed before this
court that the intention of the accused <,> was uh <,> to assualt the
deceased <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#99:1:A>
Hence <,> the learned speical P P <,,> states that he was uh <,> he
has proved the case against the accused <,> and he may be convicted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#100:1:A>
The learned defence counsel <,,> <indig> Shri </indig> <,> <@>
Chari </@> appearing uh <,> for the accused <,> has canvassed before this
court that <,,> that the blood group of accused is <,,> admittedly of O group

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#101:1:A>
She has uh <,> C A has also opined that exhibit <,,> numbers one
two <,,> three and five were having blood uh <,> of blood group O <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#102:1:A>
In this case the uh <,,> uh <,,> accused assaulted the deceased
<,,> with article uh three knife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#103:1:A>
The knife article three is having blood group of O <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#104:1:A>
Uh <,> O category <,> that is of the accused <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#105:1:A>
The learned uh <,> defence counsel then raised a query before this
court <,> and then uh and has canvassed before this court that <,> in that
case how <,> is that that the blood of O group can be <,,> detected on
article uh <,,> three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#106:1:A>
Because according to P W number uh <,> P W number one two and
three <,,> accused assaulted the deceased by article three <,,> and that the
knife had uh <,> uh on its blade <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#107:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#108:1:A>

O group <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#109:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#110:1:A>
It is possible that the deceased can have <,> also the blood group
<,,> O <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#111:1:A>
But iron of the blood sent to the C A for blood grouping <,> of
the deceased was analysed <,> and the C A in his uh <,> in this respect <,,>
uh in his report <,> exhibit sixteen opined <,> that the blood group of <,>
uh exhibit uh one <,> cannot be determined as the result <,> results are
inconclusive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#112:1:A>
He therefore uh <,,> doesn't say that the <,> deceased was also
having O group <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#113:1:A>
But he says that <,,> the blood group of exhibit one cannot be
determined as the results are inconclusive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#114:1:A>
Next para

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#115:1:A>
Then uh <,> next question arises for the consideration <,,>
according to the learned defence counsel is that <,,> as to how the blood of
the accused <,> appeared on article three and five <,,> who was not assaulted
by the deceased <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-067#116:1:A>
No <,,> witness is saying <,> that the deceased had uh also uh
<,,> also assaulted the accused <,>

accused is falsely implicated in this case <,> and that he may be <,,>
acquitted <,,>
