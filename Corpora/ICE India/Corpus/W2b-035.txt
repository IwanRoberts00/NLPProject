<bold> Irradiated foods are <&> centered </&> safe for human <&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#3:1>
But how <&> centered </&> viable they are for <&> centered </&>
commercial <&> centered </&> exploitation in a <&> centered </&> developing
country like <&> centered </&> Indiac ? </bold> </p> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ANY </smallcaps> </bold> method of food preservation,
be it sterilizing, drying, freezing, canning or irradiation, aims at
killing or rending sterile insect pests, reducing the level of bacterial
contamination or in case of fruits and vegetables to prevent or delay their
ripening, with the sole purpose of giving them a longer shelf-life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#5:1>
Irradiation as a method of food preservation has been studied
more extensively than any other method over the last three decades.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#6:1>
However, despite the fact that it is a simple and safe technology, its
acceptance and commercialization has been slow.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#7:1>
One of the reasons is that a food irradiation facility entails
considerable financial investment which the industry would <O> two
photographs spread over column one to three, side by side </O> <O> caption
</O> be reluctant to make when alternate chemical and physical preservation
techniques are already in use.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#8:1>
Other reasons are: the technology is still not fully accepted or even
understood by many food technologists; it requires strict regulatory
procedures; and the fear the public has of anything to do with <quote> `
irradiation' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#9:1>
The main fears voiced are that irradiation will make the food
radioactive, induce chemical changes in it, and the irradiation facility
itself will pose a risk to workers and members of the public in case of an
accident or even under normal conditions, although most of these fears are
unfounded.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#10:1>
Food irradiation, on the other hand, is a commercially viable and
pollution-free technique of extending the shelf-life of many foods.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#11:1>
But it does not imply that irradiation is the ideal solution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#12:1>
The biggest drawback in the marketing of irradiated food today is
that foodstuffs after and before irradiation look identical and there is no
simple or commercially viable test to determine if the food with a higher
price tag claiming to be irradiated is actually so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#13:1>
Although research in the area of food irradiation began in the US
in the <w> 1940's </w> , it was only after the blanket clearance given by the
joint FAO / IAEA / WHO ( Food and Agriculture Organization, International
Atomic Energy Agency, World Health Organization) expert committee in
1981 recommending that all foodstuffs irradiated up to 10 kGy ( Gy stands
for gray, which is a measure of the absorbed energy ) could be used without
any further toxicological or nutritional testing, that food irradiation
programmes really opened up the world over. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#14:1>
The USSR was the first country to go into full-scale
commercialization of irradiated food products.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#15:1>
Others soon followed suit; Belgium, France, Netherlands and Canada
have been irradiating fish and meat products; Japan, Hungary and Mexico,
potatoes and onions; Argentina, Brazil, Denmark, France, Finland,
Hungary, Norway, USA and Yugoslavia use irradiation to preserve species.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#16:1>
To date 36 countries have cleared one or more irradiated food
products for consumption and around 150 commercial food irradiating
facilities are operating in 19 countries, including those used for
sterilizing medical products. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#17:1>
<h> <bold> How irradiation is done </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#18:1>
Food irradiation means exposing food to high-energy
electromagnetic radiations such as X-rays and gamma rays or accelerated
electron beams having energies up to 10 million electron volts ( Mev).

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#19:1>
By penetrating into the cells of micro-organisms, the radiations
cause structural and functional changes in biomolecules leading to cell
death.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#20:1>
The effect is either direct, that is, the molecules absorb radiation
energy causing self-destruction, or indirect, that is, the radiation is
absorbed by other molecules which react with the cell constituents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#21:1>
Investigations suggest that the DNA of the cell is the prime target
of these radiations but the precise mechanism by which DNA damage occurs is
still not clear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#22:1>
Bothe X-ray/gamma ray and electron beam methods have their
advantages and disadvantages.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#23:1>
Electron beams are safer since they do not involve transport of
radioactive material.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#24:1>
They can be directed to the target and turned off for repair or
maintenance work.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#25:1>
However, the method is expensive and the electrons have a low
penetrating <O> <&> page </&> 49 </O> <O> two tables side by side, across
page 50 </O> <O> captions </O> power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#26:1>
So they can be used for irradiating a thin layer of food, for
example, grain on a conveyor belt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#27:1>
On the other hand, X-rays and gamma rays have a high-penetrating
power, but the former are again expensive and not used in food
irradiation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#28:1>
Although many experts feel that the future of food irradiation lies
with electron beams, the choice today seems to be gamma rays, which
require strict precautions since they are emitted in all directions from a
radioactive source.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#29:1>
The radioactive nuclides, cobalt-60 and caesium-137 have been
selected internationally as gamma ray sources, taking into account their
economics, availability and safety.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#30:1>
Neither of the nuclides gives rise to any gaseous intermediates as
they decay, which is important since the radioactive source is encapsulated
in a stainless steel rod and welded. </p> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption
</O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#31:1>
<h> <bold> Where irradiation is required </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#32:1>
All foods are not amenable to irradiation processing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#33:1>
For instance, milk, eggs and high-fat-foods are not to be treated
with gamma radiation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#34:1>
Being a need-based technology, it is used only when economically
advantageous. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#35:1>
Irradiation is used to delay the sprouting of onions and potatoes
and the ripening of fruits and vegetables, kill or render sterile insect
pests and reduce bacterial contamination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#36:1>
Irradiation followed by storage at 15 <sp> o</sp> C enables
long-term storage of potatoes and is a cheaper alternative to storing
under-refrigerated conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#37:1>
Onions also have to be stored under wellventilated conditions to
prevent rotting.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#38:1>
While the actual dosage used depends on the function to be carried
out ( see Table. 1 ) , the energy of the gamma radiation is much below the
level which can induce radioactivity, the main fear of the public.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#39:1>
( Radiation sources, however, are widely used today in industrial
radiographic cameras, nuclear medicine and X-ray units and nuclear power
and research reac. tors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#40:1>
In fact, 65 per cent of the total radiation an average person is
exposed to, is due to natural cosmic radiations, 33 per cent to medical
radiations, 1 to 2 per cent from nuclear explosions and the remaining from
the running of nuclear reactors. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#41:1>
In case of food irradiation there is no direct contact with the
radioactive source and the food does not get contaminated just as a bag
passing through an X-ray machine does not become radioactive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#42:1>
Irradiation offers an alternative to the use of chemicals which
leave behind toxic residues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#43:1>
Present measures taken to prevent losses in stored grains due to
insect infestation include fumigation with chemical pesticides.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#44:1>
It has been shown that irradiation of wheat is effective against all
stages of insect life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#45:1>
It must be emphasized, however, that irradiation alone will not be
not sufficient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#46:1>
In the absence of proper storage facilities and handling practices,
reinfestation can occur.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#47:1>
Evidence as to whether fungal infestations are affected by
irradiation are confusing and conflicting.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#48:1>
One study by the National Institute of Nutrition ( NIN ) ,
Hyderabad, shows that irradiation of wheat leads to the production of
aflatoxins, whereas many other studies indicate that at dosages required
for insect disinfectations, there is a restricted growth of toxin producing
fungi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#49:1>
In another study, again by NIN, severely undernourished
children who were fed freshly irradiated wheat developed a condition known
as polyploidy, in which extra chromosomes are developed in the cells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#50:1>
A subsequent Chinese study did not find this problem and even in
NIN, children who were fed irradiated wheat which had been stored for 12
weeks did not show this condition. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#51:1>
<h> <bold> Cold process </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#52:1>
An advantage of irradiation is that it is a cold process and does
not increase the temperature of the food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#53:1>
This allows the processing of frozen foods such as fish and shrimps.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#54:1>
Due to the highly penetrating nature of radiations, the food can
be irradiated in pre-packed conditiions, thus avoiding recontamination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#55:1>
India today exports sea foods worth <indig> Rs. </indig> 4,000
million annually.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#56:1>
Many of these consignments get rejected due to contamination with
salmonella from frozen sea food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#57:1>
It has been shown that irradiation at four to five kGy eliminates
salmonella in frozen sea food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#58:1>
It is perhaps to combat these endemic levels of salmonella in sea
food and chicken that irradiation can be used.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#59:1>
One can very well argue that salmonella can however can be controlled
by increased levels of hygiene and irradiation should not be used as a
cover for <O> <&> page </&> 50 </O> this.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#60:1>
But after realizing the efficiency of irradiation, the US and UK
governments have cleared irradiation of poultry and seafoods recently.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#61:1>
Spices often get contaminated with bacteria, moulds and insects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#62:1>
They can be treated with fumigants like methyl bromide, ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#63:1>
A single irradiation treatment at a dose of up to 10 kGy can also
be used to decontaminate them under pre-packed conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#64:1>
Spices, especially black pepper, cardamom, ginger and turmeric,
form a substantial part of <w> India's </w> exports to the USA, Europe and
the Middle East.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#65:1>
These countries have been processing the spices at the point of
import by fumigation and in some cases with the emerging irradiation
technique.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#66:1>
With the banning of ethylene oxide the world over because <O>
photograph across column one and two </O> <O> caption </O> it leaves toxic
residues, and irradiation at a maximum of 10kGy having been cleared as being
safe, the latter method is gaining popularity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#67:1>
The National Monitoring Agency ( NMA ) constituted by the
Government of India to oversee all aspects of food irradiation has accorded
clearance for the irradiation of onions, frozen seafoods and spices for
export.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#68:1>
It is proposing to build the first commercial irradiator in India for
the processing of spices at Cochin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#69:1>
The facility is expected to take about two years for completion at a
cost of approximately <indig> Rs. </indig> 12 million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#70:1>
The target market for the irradiated foods is the USA, UK and Europe.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#71:1>
Although there is a market in Japan they will not accept food
irradiated in any other country than their own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#72:1>
As yet clearance has not been given for domestic consumption,
since the standards such as labelling etc have not been finalized by the
health ministry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#73:1>
Initially clearance will be given for onions, potatoes and spices.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#74:1>
It is expected that the former two will cost about 10-15 <indig>
paise </indig> per kg extra.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#75:1>
For spices it will be more but these are expensive commodities
anyway. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#76:1>
Fruits such as avocados, bananas, guavas, mangoes and pears
irradiated in the mature but unripe state show a delay in ripening.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#77:1>
This is attributed to the reduced sensitivity of the fruits to the
action of the ripening harmones as well as the slowing down of the
metabolic pathways.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#78:1>
Although this would give them an extended shelf-life, how desirable
this would be is debatable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#79:1>
( Since fresh-looking fruits and vegetables would not really be
so. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#80:1>
Irradiation can and is being used as a quarantine treatment
for papayas in the US and is known to kill the mango seed weevil, which at
present inhibits us from exporting mangoes to the US and Japan. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#81:1>
<h> <bold> Capital intensive technology </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#82:1>
Food irradiation is a capital intensive technology and the
installation and running costs are extremely high.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#83:1>
Furthermore, the facility must be utilized round the clock so as to
make full use of an expensive, constantly decaying source.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#84:1>
The capital and service costs for food irradiation processing, based
on 1988 data evaluated by technical studies at BARC are shown in Table.2.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#85:1>
Costs abroad have been estimated as high as

$ 2 to 4 million as an on site extension to a food processing plant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#86:1>
The food processing companies would therefore need to find a bulk
market to justify the high capital costs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#87:1>
Whether or not a developing country like India should go in for such
a capital intensive technology in the absence of proper storage
facilities such as insect-proof bags and silos, refrigeration and an
efficient transport system is arguable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#88:1>
The actual quantification of savings in food losses is a rather grey
area, since true figures are often not available and even if known, not
readily accepted by concerned agencies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#89:1>
The temptation to cheat and irradiate a badly contaminated product
also exists and strict monitoring and control is necessary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#90:1>
Since food is often irradiated in the pre-packed condition to
avoid reinfestation, the packaging material should not be adversely
affected by radiation leading to the contamination of food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#91:1>
An approved list of packaging materials suitable for radiation
processing has been arrived at as a result of an extensive research in USA
and Canada. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#92:1>
Another area where research is necessary is in monitoring the
chemical effects of irradiation and comparing them with other changes that
may take place in food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#93:1>
Although the radiation doses are well below the levels which produce
radioactivity, knowledge of radioactivity produced at higher energies is
still unsatisfactory.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#94:1>
A fear expressed by some sections is that the process may not kill
all the microorganisms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#95:1>
It is known that ionizing radiations are mutagenic and lethal for
most bacteria.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#96:1>
However, the proportion of a bacterial population surviving a dose
of radiation depends on the species, the stage in its life-cycle, the amount
of radiation damage and the ability of the damaged species to revive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#97:1>
It is feared that the surviving bacteria or their spores would grow
and multiply without competition when other organisms have been killed and
could produce toxins in food that appears edible due to the absence of
spoilage organisms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-035#98:1>
The fact that some bacteria can mutate to form more resistant strains
has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-035#99:1>
Irradiation as a method of food preservation may not be the
perfect solution for our country, but we may have to accept the fact that
just as we cannot avoid the use of pesticides despite all the proven hazards,
it may be impossible for us to avoid food irradiation in the near future,
given the fact that when applied appropriately, it does not pose
toxicological hazards, is clean and less energy consuming than other
preservation methods. </p> <logos> </I>
