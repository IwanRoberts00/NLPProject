<bold> The transference of pollen from an anther to a stigma is a
powerful trigger that sets into motion a chain of fascinating events
</bold> </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#6:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> <indig> peepal </indig>
tree, <it> <foreign> Ficus religiosa </foreign> </it> , also known as <it>
ashwattha </it> , is a sacred tree for most Hindus and is also revered by
Buddhists.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#7:1>
This tree, found so commonly all over India, is home for a species of
wasp - - <it> <foreign> Blastophaga quadraticeps </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#8:1>
The female wasp enters a receptacle on which the <it> <foreign> Ficus
</foreign> </it> flower is borne, and <O> <&> page </&> 9 </O> breeds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#9:1>
As part of this breeding cycle pollination of the fig-flower is
effected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#10:1>
<indig> Jaiphal </indig> ( <it> <foreign> Myristica fragrans
</foreign> </it> ) is pollinated by abeetle called <it> <foreign>
Formicomus braminus </foreign> </it> , so named because in Latin, <quote>
" formica" </quote> means <mention> ant </mention> , and the beetle is
ant-like in behaviour and appearance, except for its flight pattern, which
is active and strong.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#11:1>
The hairy body collects pollen while moving about inside the male
flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#12:1>
During attempts to enter the female flower the beetle pollinates the
stigma.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#13:1>
This would be classed as a specialized beetle-pollinated system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#14:1>
The <indig> papaya </indig> tree ( <it> <foreign> Carica papaya
</foreign> </it> ) has a very interesting method of pollination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#15:1>
It gets pollinated by mistake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#16:1>
Here, the male and female flowers are borne on different trees.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#17:1>
The male flower offers both pollen and nectar to the insect or bird
which visits it, whereas the female flower has nothing to offer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#18:1>
Yet the female gets pollinated and sets fruit and seed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#19:1>
This is because one of the many insects which visit the flowers, a
hawkmoth, also visits the female flower by chance, thus pollinating it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#20:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> POLLINATION </smallcaps> </bold> , in simplistic
terms, is the transference of pollen from an anther onto a stigma - - in
other words, the transfer of the male component of a flower to the female
one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#21:1>
What would at a glance seem like so uncluttered and easy a process is
actually one of the most powerful triggers that nature possesses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#22:1>
A trigger that sets into motion a gamut of the most varied and
fascinating mechanisms in the whole world of living things.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#23:1>
It is pollination that allows a plant to set fruit and seed; in
essence, to reproduce and perpetuate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#24:1>
It can be said that pollination has brought about a revolution in
the human perception of flowers, insects and birds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#25:1>
How many of us have <O> photograph over second and third columns </O>
<O> caption over second and third columns </O> really tried to understand the
reason behind an observation so routine and seemingly so mundane as a
butterfly alighting on a brightly coloured flower or a sunbird flitting
amidst bottle-brush blossoms?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#26:1>
Pollination of a flower can never occur in isolation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#27:1>
In fact, it takes place in an intricate habitat of rather amazing
complexity, an ecosystem with populations of plants and animals,
interdependent and competing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#28:1>
This fact accentuates the importance of pollination, widening its
scope and significance in life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#29:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> WHEN </smallcaps> </bold> Darwin examined the
Madagascar Star orchid, <it> <foreign> Anagraecum sesquipedale </foreign>
</it> , which has 25-30 cm long spur and contains nectar, he predicted
pollination by some giant hawkmoth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#30:1>
It was in 1903, 40 years after <w> Drawin's </w> observations were
published in <it> <mention> On the Origin of Species </mention> </it> in
1859, that the hawkmoth fitting this description <it> <foreign> Xanthopan
morgani </it> f. <it> <foreign> praedicta </foreign> </it> was discovered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#31:1>
The average spur length in the orchid is 28-32 cm and length of
<foreign> proboscis </foreign> or the tongue in the hawkmoth reaches about 25
cm.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#32:1>
Earlier considered only as a fanciful though absorbing anecdote,
<w> Darwin's </w> inferences from the Madagascar Star orchid are today
the focal point of the general theory of co-evo-lution between animals and
flowering plants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#33:1>
The historical facts about flowers - - or rather about flowering
plants - - are enshrouded in mystery. <O> <&> page </&> 10 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#34:1>
Fossil evidence is patchy and the story that rocks have to tell is
more of blanks and less of tangible truth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#35:1>
Yet, one does believe that in the Upper ( etaceous period of the
geological time scale plants with flowers - - the angiosperms - - dominated
<w> Earth's </w> vegetation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#36:1>
It is interesting to note that the evolution of flowering plants has
followed a path of close co-evolution with insects, right from the
beginning - - bringing one round to the all important phenomenon of
pollination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#37:1>
Evolutionarily speaking, however, pollination is not unique to these
higher plants; it is something which is found to occur almost throughout the
green world, from algae upwards, and the reproducible unit is essentially
uniform.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#38:1>
But the spores of lower plants are different from the pollen grains
of higher plants in that they can germinate in a fairly wide choice of
places.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#39:1>
The pollen grain is relatively more selective, germinating only on
the right stigma.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#40:1>
It is perhaps this absolute <O> photograph over column one and two
</O> <O> caption </O> need for tremendous precision in pollen grains that has
been the driving force in the evolution of such highly sophisticated
adaptations between a flower and its pollinator. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#41:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THAT </smallcaps> </bold> a flower can become a fruit
after pollination was known to man long before modern science developed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#42:1>
Talking of antiguity of such knowledge, Theophrastus who lived
between 373 and 285 B.C. knew that the date-palm ( <it> <foreign> Phoenix
dactylifera </foreign> </it> ) gives a better harvest if the flowers from
the male tree ( the male and female trees in the date-palm are separate,
i.e., it is a unisexual tree ) are dusted over the female tree when it is
just about setting fruit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#43:1>
This also meant that most Greek and Roman writers knew of this need
for pollination in the date palm.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#44:1>
Through the ages, after these early writings, the idea grew and in
the 17th century Rudolph Jacob Camerarius, a professor at Tubingen in
Germany, thought of an elegant experiment to demonstrate the importance of
sex in plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#45:1>
On removing the anthers - - the male component - - from the
bisexual flower of the castor oil plant ( <it> Ricinus communis </it> ) , he
found, the flower did not form a fruit at all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#46:1>
The world took its own time to accept the truth in this discovery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#47:1>
Of course, by the mid-18th century, pollination had become a
systematic discipline and by the start of the 19th century, Darwin published
many papers on this intriguing subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#48:1>
After so many years of curiosity, pollination still amazes the
naturalist, the casual observer, and even the pollination biologist!

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#49:1>
And why not?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#50:1>
Pollination of a flower culminates in a fruit and seed, and it is the
seed that sustains all life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#51:1>
It is this seed which has aided human civilization in unlimited ways.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#52:1>
There is an incredible variety of flowers in nature.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#53:1>
They differ in size, shape, colour, smell, and some in their
function.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#54:1>
Such variations are the basis of diversity which is pivotal in
defining the dynamics of life itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#55:1>
Such diversity also reflects itself in the large number of
pollination mechanisms that exist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#56:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> POLLINATIONS </smallcaps> </bold> may occur in
absolute purity of surroundings - - within one flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#57:1>
Known as self-pollination for obvious reasons here the pollen grains
of a flower pollinate their own stigma, managing thus, to produce a pure
seed with no <quote> " contamination" </quote> from outside.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#58:1>
Selfing, Charles Darwin is known to have said, is always disliked
by nature.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#59:1>
But there is a variety of small, herbaceous plants which are
self-pollinated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#60:1>
A plant which has perhaps shaped and directed human civilization
is wheat ( <foreign> <it> Triticum </foreign> </it> spp. </foreign> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#61:1>
This vital grass has a self-pollinated flower, and each flower is an
independent <O> <&> page </&> 11 </O> unit which is totally capable
of producing a grain without any help from outside its micro-environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#62:1>
Such self-pollination and fertilization is generally a
strategy used by plants with a short life cycle - - the annuals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#63:1>
By adapting thus, the plant is actually minimizing the risk of
depending on any external factor for pollination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#64:1>
With so much diversity in life it is perhaps not surprising that
there is another class of flowers which, even though they are totally
self-pollinated, still need the impetus of an insect visit to actually get
pollinated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#65:1>
Many legume flowers need such trigger.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#66:1>
Floral architecture in such flowers is so fashioned that unless an
insect alights on the flower and mechanically forces the pollen onto the
stigma, pollination does not occur.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#67:1>
This activity is very aptly known as <quote> " tripping" </quote> ,
whereby the insect trips the pollen onto the stigma.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#68:1>
Then there is the tomato flower ( <it> <foreign> Lycopersicon
esculentum </foreign> </it> ) which, though self-pollinated, needs <O>
photograph below column one and two </O> <O> name of photographer </O> an
insect to visit and bring the pollen onto the stigma. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#69:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> POLLINATION </smallcaps> </bold> is a truly
flexible natural phenomenon which can occur under a diverse range of
physical conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#70:1>
There is a kind of flower known as cleistogamous flower where the
very basic process of <quote> ` opening' </quote> is redundant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#71:1>
The flower <O> photograph below column two and three </O> <O> caption
</O> does not at any point in its cycle, show its reproductive parts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#72:1>
<quote> <foreign> " Cleisto" </foreign> </quote> in Greek is <quote>
" hidden" </quote> , and <quote> <foreign> " gamy" </foreign> </quote> is
<quote> " marriage" </quote> , and such flowers are purely self-pollinated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#73:1>
But then why should a flower be cleistogamous when evolutionarily it
would be more advantageous to become cross-fertilized?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#74:1>
Such flowers - - which look like small buds - - are produced when
environmental conditions are adverse and the plant is unable to produce
large, <quote> ` normal' </quote> , or chasmogamous flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#75:1>
This is a classic case of adaptation by plants to ensure seed set
even in harsh climatic conditions, like the plant <it> <foreign> Viola
mirabilis </foreign> </it> the famous violet flower. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#76:1>
A plant of South American origin called <it> <mention> Ruellia
</mention> </it> produce conspicuous bell-shaped violet flowers right through
the summer in India, but once the cold weather sets in the flowers are just
green buds never once opening.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#77:1>
The beauty is that both kinds of flowers produce fruit and seed which
have the full capability <O> <&> page </&> 12 </O> to grow into plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#78:1>
There are times when such selfing occurs for the simple reason that
pollinators are not available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#79:1>
In the harsh cold clime of the northwestern British Isles where no
insects are able to survive, the flowers of a plant called <it> Pinguicula
</it> , otherwise insect-pollinated, are regularly selfed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#80:1>
Plants and Nature alike, leave nothing to chance. </p> <O> photograph
</O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#81:1>
Nature excels in intriguing mechanisms, all evolved rationally
over time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#82:1>
Isn't it surprising that a vast number of plants have strategies
which allow them to be a cut above those which are self-pollinated?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#83:1>
These plants set seed only when cross-fertilized - - when their
stigma gets pollinated only by pollen from another individual, of the same
species, of course.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#84:1>
Such cross-breeding <O> column 2 & 3 photographs, one above and the
other below </O> <O> caption in middle </O> naturally encourages a
heterogenous character in the offspring - - characters which, being a
mixture, make these offspring more fit than their self-fertilized compariots!

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#85:1>
But such crossing - - also known as out-crossing for obvious
reasons - - is not easy to achieve.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#86:1>
For the plant it implies a high degree of adaptation, with the use of
refined strategies to be able to attract pollen from an external source
- - sometimes really distant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#87:1>
Here begins one of the most wondrous stories of synchrony and
harmonization in Nature - - that of a flower and its pollinator. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#88:1>
Pollinators - - pivots in the fertilization process - - are,
in a wider perspective, known as agents of pollination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#89:1>
These natural agents show a tremendous range in their character, from
the non - - living to the living, <O> <&> page </&> 13 </O> from rain and
wind to birds, ants, beetles, bees and butterflies and, sometimes, even
rodents and bats.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#90:1>
These pollinators - - known thus because they actually bring about
pollination by their actions - - are of as much significance as the flowers
themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#91:1>
Now, one looks at a relationship between a plant and its
pollinator, not one particular organism in isolation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#92:1>
This relationship, manifested in a multitude of ways, can be seen
every day, every time a butterfly alights on a flower or a Purple sunbird
hovers in the coral <w> tree's </w> canopy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#93:1>
<bold> A </bold> honey-bee visits the Hollyhock, an ornamental
plant with brightly coloured flowers in the small green patch outside your
house.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#94:1>
This bee, known for its aggressive nature and rather potent sting, is
<it> Apis </it> sp.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#95:1>
Is the visit casual, a chance happening?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#96:1>
Or is it highly programmed, a specific visit to a specific flower for
a specific purpose?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#97:1>
By bringing pollen from another plant and managing to dust this
pollen onto the stigma of this flower, the plant is allowed to reproduce,
but what is the <w> bee's </w> part of the bargain?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#98:1>
Nature functions with an incredible degree of frugality and planning,
with nothing happening without a reason.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#99:1>
So the bee surely gets something in return, but, what?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#100:1>
In the finely tuned environment of the flower and the bee, what is
actually taking place is something that involves a highlevel transfer of
bio-energy, and - coadaptation, the chemistry of floral rewards and
the changes brought about by pollination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#101:1>
The bee expends a fair amount of its energy in bringing pollen to a
flower from a distant source.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#102:1>
Is this energy replenished?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#103:1>
By nectar or pollen?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#104:1>
Are these commodities food for the bee-food of sufficient
nutritional value and economy to make the bee work so hard to receive
these rewards? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#105:1>
Nectar and pollen have been shown and proved with considerable
evidence to be rich sources of energy for insects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#106:1>
Both these components of flowers are chemically rich; nectar
contains amino acids and sugars and pollen contains starch and protein.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#107:1>
These are the rewards; a bee or a butterfly goes in search of
nectar, alights on a flower, inserts its <foreign> proboscis </foreign> or
tongue to collect nectar from the base of the flower, but in the process gets
coated with pollen from the same flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#108:1>
In fact, a large number of insects have special pollen sacs on their
bodies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#109:1>
The insects sucks <O> photograph below column two and three </O> <O>
caption </O> the flower dry and moves to a fresh flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#110:1>
The story repeats itself, but this time, the pollen already on the
body of the insect gets dusted onto the stigma of the second flower.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#111:1>
This seemingly small action sets into motion a physiologically very
powerful series of events - - pollen grains germinate on the stigma and
pollen tubes are formed, which grow right down to the ovary, and these tubes
carry the male gametes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#112:1>
Fusion occurs, causing one ovule to be fertilized by one such
gamete.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#113:1>
The story of the seed thus begins. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#114:1>
Yet, there is one question, what is it that attracts an insect
to a flower?

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#115:1>
This brings us to an intriguing part of this story - - the
attractants - - usually floral colour and fragrance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#116:1>
These attractants are important because they are the initiators of
the chain of events leading to pollination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#117:1>
The visual sense of insects is quite different from that of
humans.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#118:1>
For example, an <w> insect's </w> visual spectrum allows
ultraviolet vision.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#119:1>
What the human eye sees as green, is red to the insect, blue of
human definition is green to an insect, and yellow is violet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#120:1>
This visual aid, which even humans use to such a large extent, is a
powerful initial attractant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#121:1>
So also is odour, except that the olfactory sense of insects do not
differ all that much from that of humans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-025#122:1>
The olfactory sense is perhaps the strongest of all the senses
in human beings, so also with insects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#123:1>
It is intriguing that odour has been an attractant much before the
visual aid became evolutionarily prominent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-025#124:1>
Beetle pollination is known to be primitive and flowers thus
pollinated are strong smelling. </p> </I>
