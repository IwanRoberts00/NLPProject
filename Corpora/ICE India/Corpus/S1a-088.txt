<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#1:1:A>
Uh let me try with myself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#2:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> Dr Mrs Parekar

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#3:1:A>

from <,> four years

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#8:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> working as a lecturer in the department of history <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#9:1:A>
She is very close friend of mine sir <,> uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#10:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#13:1:B>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#14:1:B>
It is not making but it is <,> uh uh giving some <,> uh
alternate shape to thinking

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#15:1:B>
I think so <,> no ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#16:1:B>
Uh because there are so many problems in <,> uh villages

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#17:1:B>
That <w> I'm </w> same we are working in same place

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#X18:1:C>
<w> That's </w> very good oh </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#19:1:B>
But there are so many different problems and so many different
thinking <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#20:1:B>
Uh in that different categories and different social views sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#21:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#24:1:A>
<[> And no she came </[> </{> from different background I came
from another background <,> <{1> <[1> uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#25:1:A>
But still on some problem specially women problem <,> <[2> <[2>
<indig> haan </indig> <,> this is the very current and controversial issue in
this country <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,> we know

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#26:1:A>
But considering that point our views are equal our views are
similar I think <,> <{4> <[4> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#27:1:A>
So uh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#28:1:A>
Let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context <,>
<{5> <[5> uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#29:1:A>
So <,> uh for let us start from this department <,> <{6> <[6> uhm
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#30:1:A>
Here uh <,> you are teaching so many papers no ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#31:1:A>
So out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#32:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#33:1:B>
<[2> <indig> Haan </indig> </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#34:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#36:1:B>
<[5> Uh </[5> </{5>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#37:1:B>
<[6> Uhm </[6> </{6>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#38:1:B>
I want to like because uh my specialisation in Modern India

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#39:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#40:1:B>
And I want to <,> study it and I want to <.> dis </.> discover
out some research work <,> on the Modern Indian History <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>
mainly on the <,> uh problems of women

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#41:1:B>
And recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women
policy <,> uh that is uh declared by government of Maharashtra

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#42:1:B>
And there are so many problems related to the village woman
particularly

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#43:1:B>
And these women <,> uh village women are not knowing anything about
it

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#44:1:B>
Now because of it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#45:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#46:1:A>
Just just a minute

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#47:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#48:1:A>
Uh <,> <w> I'm </w> interested to know whether in your
syllabus the paper which you are teaching <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> Modern Indian
History <,> is there any topic which has been <,> uh recommended <,> <{2>
<[2> uhm <,> by the committee <,> specially based on women problems ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#49:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#50:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#51:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#52:1:B>
There are <,> a <,> all in all Indian history from Ancient to
Modern <,> <{1> <[1> yes <,> there are one topic <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> in
every paper

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#53:1:B>
In Ancient Indian History in Medieval Indian History in the <,> uh
Peshwa period or we can say in Maratha period <,> <{3> <[3> yes yes <,,> and
also in the <,> uh Modern Indian History

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#54:1:B>
But in modern Indian history specially it was concentrated that is
their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in
Maharashtra all over India

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#55:1:B>
In Bengal movement and there was Young <O> one word </O> movement
coming from England

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#56:1:B>
And the Rajaram Mohan Roy <,> <w> it's </w> progress

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#57:1:B>
And then he was discussing <,,> thinking his views <,> on that

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#58:1:B>
And that <,> uh <,> topic is here in the Modern Indian History

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#59:1:A>
<[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#60:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#61:1:A>
<[3> Yes yes </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#62:1:A>
Okay it means you think that as the topic has been included
here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#63:1:A>
So our students they will learn

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#64:1:A>
They will come to know about the problems of women in India <,>
<{1> <[1> uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#65:1:A>
But do you think that these <,> uh problem of Indian women
especially <,> <{2> <[2> uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#66:1:A>
It has its roots right from ancient period because <,> <w> I'm </w>
teaching Ancient Indian History

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#67:1:A>
And <w> I'm </w> interested in it

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#68:1:A>
So when we start from the age of Vedas <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,> or
more than that if we <,> uh goes back to much earlier period no doubt <,>
Indian history goes back to much earlier period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#69:1:A>
But right from the age of <.> Ri </.> Rigveda <,> I have ample
truth that the status of women or the position of women <,> uh it has been
fixed <,> uh

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#70:1:A>
<indig> Manhje </indig> though the people say <,> that in the age
of Rigveda we don't get secondary status of <,> women or like that <,> but I
don't agree with them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#71:1:A>
<indig> Manhje </indig> though there are references to <indig>
Gadgi </indig> and <{1> <[1> <indig> Maitreyi </indig> and </[1>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#72:1:A>
So many women <{2> <[2> those who are </[2> <,> uh <.> tho </.>
those <,> uh got the opportunity to learn

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#73:1:A>
But apart from that <,> in uh considering with Vedic sacrifices and
all other things I feel that status of women was secondary

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#74:1:A>
And Vedic age was <,> a base <indig> manhje </indig> when we come
to modern Indian history or modern <{3> <[3> <.> civi uh </.> </[3> how
complex is history

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#75:1:B>
<[1> Uh </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#76:1:B>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#77:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#78:1:B>
<[1> <indig> Maitri yeah </indig> </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#79:1:B>
<[2> <w> Women's </w> status </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#80:1:B>
<[3> No that was uh </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#81:1:B>
Medieval Indian history also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#82:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#83:1:B>
Because of the invasion of the Moghals

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#84:1:A>
No I know very little about <{> <[> Medieval period </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#85:1:B>
<[> During that time </[> </{> also there was also supression
of woman because of the that <,> that is the invasion of <,> Moghals <,> in
India and that was mainly on in north India <,> because <,> they invaded
south Afghanistan and <O> two words </O> because that impact was on north
India mainly

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#86:1:B>
That was not in south India

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#87:1:B>
So there was <,> so many other societies which were women <,> apart
from other field

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#88:1:B>
No doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on
this religion

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#89:1:B>
They <-> were </-> started the <indig> purdah </indig> system <,>
uhm not giving exhibition to the women <,> and during that in the home only
not giving outside them permission <,> to go outside

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#90:1:B>
That was the same thing in Medieval period

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#91:1:B>
And when there was started Modern Indian History and then new ideas
came from <,,> West <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#92:1:B>
Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who
were taken the modern Indian education <,> that is not English education

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#93:1:B>
And because of there was something strange in nineteen century

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#94:1:B>
And that was concentrated in our syllabus only

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#95:1:A>
Okay in this way <,> we have added all these things in our
syllabus <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> that our student <indig> manhje </indig> <,>
<{2> <[2> uhm <,> our syllabus had been constructed in this manner

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#96:1:A>
That right from ancient period <,> to modern period the students
should have a link <,> <{3> <[3> link <,> <indig> manhje </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#97:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#98:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#99:1:B>
<[3> Link </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#100:1:B>
What is the development of <w> one's </w>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#101:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> when we talk on once

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#102:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#103:1:B>
When we talk on or linking between the development <{> <[> of
women </[> from ancient to modern <,> till now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#104:1:B>
And they have concentrated

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#105:1:B>
They have to work on that research or anything

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#106:1:B>
Or thinking because <,> uh historian <,> or any man living in this
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between
the <,> things happened on the human behaviour

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#107:1:B>
Or the development of human behaviour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#108:1:B>
That is most important thing also <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#109:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#110:1:A>
No considering <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> this syllabus we are <,>
<{2> <[2> uhm <,> uhm quite satisfied <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,> but <,> uh have
you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the T V <{> <[> and
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#111:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#112:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#113:1:B>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#114:1:B>
<[> There </[> </{> are so many advertisements

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#115:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> but considering that <,> I feel that
<,> uh we are <,> deliberately <,> making <,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig>
<,> the status <{> <[> of </[> women secondary

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#116:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#117:1:B>
<[> Women </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#118:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#119:1:A>
Means how the <,> standard of <,> uh women has been exposed
there <,> I don't like this

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#120:1:B>
That is the commercial purpose no ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#121:1:B>
In commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a
bit thinking only benefit of their <,> product

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#122:1:A>
<indig> Manhje </indig> for every

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#123:1:B>
And because of that because of they are doing and <,> we are
permitting them always <,> because one lady has even that <,> uh photo copies
no ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#124:1:A>
Yeah <indig> manhje </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#125:1:B>
That is <{> <[> why our main impulsion </[> we are giving we
are also contributing them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#126:1:A>
<[> That is very recently that </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#127:1:B>
Madhu <{> <[> Sapre </[> is that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#128:1:A>
<[> Indirectly </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#129:1:A>
Madhu Sapre is one of the representative of us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#130:1:A>
No doubt she is a model

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#131:1:B>
No after all <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#132:1:A>
But she is representing us no <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#133:1:B>
Although <{> <[> expressing </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#134:1:A>
<[> We can't </[> </{> change <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> we can't
change her views <,> though she afterward thinking about that <w> I'm </w>
not doing it purposefully and that is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#135:1:A>
But that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that
way <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#136:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#137:1:B>
Look commercial purpose is okay I can understand it

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#138:1:B>
But on one side you say <,> that women lib when we talk of women
liberation and secondary status of women <,> and on other side we are
allowing them <,> <{> <[> ah yes <,> to express to expose

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#139:1:A>
<[> Ah yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#140:1:A>
<indig> Nai nai </indig> women is permitting them gents

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#141:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#142:1:A>
Even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she
denies it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#143:1:A>
How they were able to take it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#144:1:B>
Because if you will look at all the <.> ac </.> actresses <,>
<{> <[> uhm <,> mainly Marathi actresses they are that Mamta Kulkarni and
Shilpa <{> <[> Shirodkar </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#145:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#146:1:A>
<[> Always there </[> </{> is a rule

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#147:1:B>
It is a shameful thing I think <,,> <indig> manhje </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#148:1:A>
It is shameful <O> laughs </O> thing but it is

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#149:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#150:1:A>
Being <,> men focussed by <,,> men but ladies also giving <.>
pro </.> protection by <,> girls also <,,> that is they want so uh become
something <,> hero <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#151:1:A>
And because of that they exposing even they themselves only <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#152:1:B>
Uhm no but <,> uh what is your experience about your <,> uh
village ladies and village girls <,> specially

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#153:1:A>
Uh village girls

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#154:1:B>
Those who are taking education now a days

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#155:1:A>
No what is the problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#156:1:B>
Women

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#157:1:A>
Only then one <,> uh thinking going on in the <,> mothers of
that girl <,> that there are so many <,> uh <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>
changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated
person

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#158:1:B>
<[> Changes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#159:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#160:1:A>
And so she <,> will take the education

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#161:1:A>
That is not another thing because educated <,> uh <.> b </.>
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#162:1:A>
And there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their
mother and family members <,> in their mind <,> that there was a <,> well
behaved educated and there must be <,> well man must be working in the city
level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages

There are so many they <,> send that girl in the farm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#164:1:A>

must be <,> given some higher education till their marriage <,,> not for
there <O> one word </O> that is wrong <,> that is not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#166:1:A>

them to go into medical college <,> for D H M H or B A M A only that one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#167:1:A>

point <,>

<[> Easily stopped </[> </{> <indig> na </indig> not in this
context nobody is reading now a days <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#205:1:A>
That is not the case with village girls or village women <,>
in cities also you know <,> I feel <,> uh this <,> uh problem mainly with my
son <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#206:1:A>
Now he is in in uh third standard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#207:1:A>
But <,> uh just from seven or seven-thirty <,> he used to sit <,>
uh with the T V <,> and used to see the programme every programme <,> upto
eleven pm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#208:1:A>
In our village also we have started <,> uh one uh <,> personality
development class for some a ten year students <,> uh in the village but
never the students went there <,> because he wants only T V <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#209:1:A>
They never goes there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#210:1:A>
In any <O> one word </O> or any social or even they not in this
for playing also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#211:1:A>
They are their interests are also <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#212:1:B>
So this is a common problem

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#213:1:A>
Common problem or <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#214:1:B>
<indig> Manhje </indig> impact of T V in this <,> aspect that
is it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#215:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#216:1:B>
If it is a good impact <,,> then <,> ah then we would not
have talked like this <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#217:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#218:1:A>
And there are so many <,> English programmes and English movies
and all these things are very nice on the T V after ten <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#219:1:A>
But <,> uh <{1> <[1> they never uh </[1> because they want to go
in the farm <{2> <[2> tomorrow </[2> morning and so they <}> <-> were </->
<+> are </+> </}> going to sleep at eight <w> O'clock </w> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#220:1:A>
After completing the Marathi and other <,> uh that is a <,>
provincial movies and all the things <,,>

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#X221:1:C>
<[1> They don't they don't go </[1> </{1> </X>

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#X222:1:C>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#223:1:B>
But nobody is well acquainted <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> with the
<,> current <{1> <[1> problem </[1> of the women again this is my opinion
because <,> uh day by day when we look at the newspaper <,> and when we look
at the number <,> of this dowry cases all these <,> <{2> <[2> oh yes <,>
burning down the girls and burnings of the <,> women <{2> <[2> so <w> that's
</w> </[2> number is increasing <,> on one side <,> and <,> on another side
<{3> <[3> that attraction </[3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#224:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#225:1:A>
<[1> Problem </[1> </{1>

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#X226:1:C>
<[2> Oh yes </[2> </{2> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#227:1:A>
<[2> And they </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#228:1:A>
<[3> And here </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-088#229:1:A>
Not only cities but in villages also there are <,> every
mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter <,,> in
comparison with others <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#230:1:A>
That is their thinking and because of that they demanding <,> that
uh from husband that we want to <O> one word </O> we have to give it <,,>
because it is our duty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#231:1:A>
We have we must have satisfaction to our <,> uh daughter we must
satisfy our daughter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-088#232:1:A>
And daughter <,> is also demanding there is not feeling that my
mother is <,> <.> fa </.> father is not he <w> he's </w> giving it is not
enough <,> but they are demanding <,> </I>
