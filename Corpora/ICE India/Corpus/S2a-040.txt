<ICE-IND:S2A-040#1:1:A>
Hello everybody <,,> my name is Ramesh <,> and I would like to  
speak <,> about <mention> Indian Culture and Indian Art </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#2:1:A>
First we have to know what exactly is Indian Culture <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#3:1:A>
Indian Culture <,> flips the whole and soul of the <,,> the  
spiritual life of a person <,> or the <,> spiritual mentality of a person  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#4:1:A>
Now <,,> when we compare the Indian culture <,> with the other  
cultures <,> Indian culture is considered as <-> the </-> one of the ancient  
and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture <,> of the world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#5:1:A>
Now we should know <,> what exactly is the culture <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#6:1:A>
And what exactly is the art <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#7:1:A>
Culture <,,> as far as <,> India is concerned <,,> is <,> a way of  
life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#8:1:A>
But <,,> the way we are culturing it now <,,> that is <,,> totally  
we are going in a different concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#9:1:A>
That culture <,> is totally apart <,> from the culture what <w> I'm  
</w> going to speak <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#10:1:A>
<w> India's </w> cultural heritage actually <w> it's </w> not only  
one of the most ancient <,> but it is also one of the <,> most extensive and  
varied <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#11:1:A>
Uh <indig> tu </indig> it has contributed <,> uh throughout the  
ages <,> many races and people <,> uh who have either temporarily <,> come  
into contact with India or have permanently settled within <,> her borders  
<,> joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive  
Indian culture <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#12:1:A>
The key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal  
values <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#13:1:A>
Now <,,> it gives us <,> glimpses of Vedic Civilisation <,,> that  
Indian Culture <,> which is having a history of four thousand <,> more than  
four thousand <,> years ago <,,> that is including Indus Valley Civilisation  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#14:1:A>
Now the Indian culture was laid <,> and of the China the Buddhist  
movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the  
masses <,> and classes of the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#15:1:A>
That actually is the foundation of the <,,> uh two great ideals of  
India <,,> that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#16:1:A>
Uh <,,> it <}> <-> have </-> <+> has </+> </}> been uh <,> truely  
laid in these early phases from which the future structure of <w> India's  
</w> culture has been raised <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#17:1:A>
As a matter of fact <,> uhn the great culture of India is basically  
a synthesis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#18:1:A>
You know a synthesis of not only <,> blood and race but also <,> uh  
speech and uh <,,> what uh <,> we can say <,,> the ways of thinking <,,> of  
which their different speeches are outward expressions <,,> as well as the  
<,> cultures that is material culture and intellectual culture and <,>  
spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#19:1:A>
The <,> uh geographical background <,,> actually <}> <-> it uh <,>  
it </- > <=> it </=> </}> should also be taken into consideration <,,>  
because man in any area any area of the world is the product of <,> as much  
of his geographical and economic environment as of his <,> racial and  
cultural bearings and movings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#20:1:A>
No culture or civilisation <,,> now this is actually going to be a  
important point <,> whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very  
very important point <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#21:1:A>
No culture or civilisation <,> have come into being in any country  
and at any age in a completed and a perfected form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#22:1:A>
Like an Athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the  
head of the divinity vision <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#23:1:A>
You know <w> that's </w> <-> a </-> actually a story <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#24:1:A>
Now man is for ever becoming <,> and like all things within and uh  
<,> his affairs are ever in a state of flux <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#25:1:A>
Uhm <,> now let us come to <,> let us jurisdict ourselves <,> to  
India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#26:1:A>
Uh India some would prefer to describe it in other way <,> as the  
expression of a basic and original <.> univa uni </.> <,> uh what do you call  
it as uh <,> the universal <,> uh unity <,> in its various uh <,,> uhm <,> we  
can say it as manifestations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#27:1:A>
This <,,> other way of looking at the matter has something  
attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive <,> uh degeneration  
from a golden age of their imagination <,> rather than in the <,> in uh <,>  
evolution through the ages <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#28:1:A>
But in fact <,> in the face of the observed facts <,> it is a case  
of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh <,> contending  
elements <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#29:1:A>
Uhm and the first human <}> <-> <.> habi </.> </-> <=> habitants  
</=> </}> of India <,,> that actually they represented various different  
races <,> whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started  
were different from each other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#30:1:A>
It was not totally a different uh <,> altogether from square one  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#31:1:A>
It is from differnt squares <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#32:1:A>
Now let us come to <,> the evolution of Indian way of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#33:1:A>
Here <,> this Indian way of life is totally <,> the foundation of  
this Indian way of life is totally Indian culture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#34:1:A>
Now the <,,> uh <,,> as a matter of fact <,> considering the vast  
amount of uh <,,> uh what <,,> literally we say it is uh <,> like your name  
in our knowledge of India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#35:1:A>
In the formative period of our culture <,,> it will not be possible  
for us to obtain the full picture <,,> out of a welter of race and movements  
<,,> and of the ideological exchanges <,> for mens and uh <,,> we can only  
see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought <,> know and the way  
of life that we can associate it with india <,> uh as a distinct entity among  
geographical units <,> and uh <,,> you know human innocence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#36:1:A>
The various races follow each other as a face to sequence <,,> that  
is <,,> making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and  
thought and spiritual prospective <,> that are in the civilisation and the  
culture and uh <,> uh the basic <,> uh ethics of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#37:1:A>
The <,> neolithical negroids from Africa the protoastroloids and  
<,> ostroids people and probably if may know that is from Asia <,> and the  
mongoloids from Far East <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#38:1:A>
No but <,,> congeries of Asian peoples <,> who appear to have  
brought <,> the dravidian language and culture to India <,> and  
Indo-Europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic <,> uh <,> all  
these things counts a lot <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#39:1:A>
Now Indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the Indian man  
<,,> <w> I'm I'm </w> specifing here Indian man <,,> which took place as the  
result of <,,> uhm <,> uhm what uh <,> they say that uh the mythology and uh  
<,,> histories of the <,> India at the time of the Aryans <,,> that is <,>  
the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and Indo-Aryans and the  
Indo-Europeans <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#40:1:A>
This this is going to be a very <,> very huge list <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#41:1:A>
Now <,,> the second half of the second millenium that is B C <,> it  
was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial <O> one word </O>  
<,,> throughout the whole of the near East <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#42:1:A>
In the <,,> as far as Indian culture is concerned <,,> I wanted to  
tell you one thing <,> that is <,,> excuse me <,> that is <,,> exactly based  
on the <,> the <mention> Vedas </mention> and the <,> <mention> Upanishads  
</mention> <,,> and uh <,> philosophical <,> concepts of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#43:1:A>
Uh in a well known Rigvedic hymn <,> that is <,> describing the  
battle fought by the Indo-Aryan king <,> Surdas with uh <,> the confederacy  
of ten kings <O> one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#44:1:A>
Actually they were uh <,,> a love people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#45:1:A>
Harikrishna Dev he is one of the well known <}> <-> <.> philo </.>  
</-> <=> philosophers </=> </}> and culturist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#46:1:A>
He said he had suggested with great <,,> plausibility that the  
tribes mentioned in the Rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the  
Egyptian documents <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#47:1:A>
And uh <,> this would suggest that <,> external influences from the  
near East was not absent even in the ancient period of <w> India's </w>  
emergence <,,> as a characterised cultural unit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#48:1:A>
And uhm <,,> this person <,> Harikrishna Dev <,,> would identify  
the farmer with the people known to Egyptians as <,,> uhm <,,> the Purasati  
who were the same as the <,> uh Philistines and Palistines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#49:1:A>
And uh <,,> <w> that's </w> convincing but nevertheless noteworthy  
<,,> in uh these proposals <,,> to identify some king mentioned in uh <,,>  
Shatpata Brahman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#50:1:A>
Now all this <,> all this why <w> I'm </w> mentioning the Sanskrit  
names is totally based on the Indian culture <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#51:1:A>
Indian culture actually <,,> these all these <,> names what <w> I'm  
</w> speaking of <,,> that is all <,> its each and every brick of our Indian  
culture <,,> you know <w> it's </w> a <,,> dream house <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#52:1:A>
Now until recently <,> it was generally admitted that Vedic  
Sanskrit was the oldest Indo-Aryan language as far as the Indian culture was  
concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#53:1:A>
Uh <,,> later finally the <,> Hitite question came before us <,,>  
that uh <,> and it is now admitted that the discovery and the reading <,,> of  
the language of the Hitites <,,> has brought forth the history of the  
Indo-European and the <}> <-> <.> earl </.> </-> <=> earlier </=> </}>  
visitor <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#54:1:A>
This would make the ancient Greek language interior to the <,,>  
Vedic by atleast a couple of countries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#55:1:A>
So <,> by observing all these things <,,> we can come to a  
conclusion <,> that <,,> Indian culture <,> actually it was not brought up on  
its own <,,> it was brought up <,> through the <,,> the influences <,>  
through the <,> the way of thinking of the other cultures <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#56:1:A>
That means <,,> we may come to know that <,,> before Indian culture  
<,,> there were some more <,,> countries <,> who were <,> who have developed  
their own cultures <,,> and their own systems and their own way of life and  
their own <,> uh way of thinking their own way of <,,> uh expressing  
themselves <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#57:1:A>
Now <,> we will look at the universal ideals of Indian culture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#58:1:A>
Now we should look upon the <,> pilgrims programmes of humanity as  
being essentially one <,,> in this great question of <,> uh which mankind has  
undertaken <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#59:1:A>
Ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage <,,>  
India in its own way <,> has made a <.> contri </.> great contribution <,,>  
in formulating this <,,> contribution of <,,> India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#60:1:A>
From the very fact that <,> its genesis are the people <,> its  
genesis as a people I am specifying here <,,> India has <,> had to take note  
of the thoughts <,> and ideas and actions and behaviours <,,> of so many  
different people so many <,> and uh take note of them sympathetic and uh <,>  
what we can say that uh <,,> you know <,,> uh all embracing spirit <,,> that  
would be <,,> the <,> the better word <,> all embracing spirit 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#61:1:A>
That means <,> it is the spirit which <,> which welcomes all the  
cultures and all the concepts <,,> all the way of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#62:1:A>
And that is what it has <,> that is what has given the basic tone  
or colour to the <,> uh uh culture of India <,,> as <,> representing a great  
synthesis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#63:1:A>
So this synthesis word actually I have already mentioned <,> that  
Indian culture it is the synthesis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#64:1:A>
And it is philosophical <,,> as well as spiritual and mystical  
synthesis <,> as well as <,> practical expression of which <,> is the sum  
total of the <,> all the philosophy <,> which developed in India <,> with the  
great ideals of uh <,,> the Vedas and the Upanishads and looming in the  
background <,,> and uh even forming the basis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#65:1:A>
The aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and  
<,,> and <}> <-> <.> accepble </.> </-> <=> acceptable </=> </}> to <,,> the  
entire mankind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#66:1:A>
It can be <,> theoritically put in a <,,> <O> one word </O> form  
<,,> that is uh <,,> a few quotations <,> from earlier Indian literature  
actually I am <,> taking this <,,> uh literature from <,,> from one of the  
<,> references <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#67:1:A>
It says thus <,,> <quote> That which is <,,> is one <,> wise men  
speak of it in many ways </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#68:1:A>
Now this <,> <w> I'm </w> specifying here <,,> that which is <,> is  
one <,> and wise men speak of it in many ways <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#69:1:A>
And uh <,> to <,,> refrain from all evil <,> to cultivate that  
which is good <,> to discipline ones own mind <,,> ignore evil <,> cultivate  
graciousness <,> develop universal love and do at your good <,,> to all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#70:1:A>
Now when we observe <,> all these quotations <,> we will get a <,>  
<}> <-> very very very </-> <=> very </=> <-> clear clear </-> <=> clear </=>  
</}> cut crystal clear idea <,> that <,> Indian culture <,> it is <,,> the  
base is very broad <,> very broad <,> and that broadness <,> that uh broad  
single base <,> and different buildings have been constructed <,> and the  
different religions <}> <-> has </-> <+> have </+> </}> been constructed that  
different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been  
constructed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#71:1:A>
Now <,> when we study Indian culture <,> actually <,,> we should  
look at the <,> geographical <,> influence <,> in the <,> on the development  
<,> and evolution of Indian culture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#72:1:A>
Now <,> I will I think that uh <,,> in studying <,> the cultural  
development of any country <,,> not only India <,> I <w> I'll I'll </w> take  
it out the general this thing <,,> the general country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#73:1:A>
In studying the cultural development of any country <,> the  
importance of uh <,> its geographical factors <,,> okay it can can hardly be  
minimised <,> in the <,> early periods of human history geography determine  
to a great extent to the <,> that the leads and uh <,> uh activities of the  
people as well as their thought and literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#74:1:A>
Now <w> I'll </w> tell you geography shaped history largely than uh  
<,> as it does even today all over the world <,> though in a different manner  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#75:1:A>
Man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but <,> he  
has not been content to live under these limitation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#76:1:A>
And he has always driven progressively to break through the  
barriers placed by the nature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#77:1:A>
And uh <,,> history of India is uh <,,> no exception <,> to this  
point <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#78:1:A>
So this interplay <,> what we call it as interplay of uh <,,> the  
forces of geography and human will <,> and genius <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#79:1:A>
Actually it is uh indeed <,,> very interesting subject <,,> and  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#80:1:A>
Now <,,> <w> we'll </w> try to <,,> uhm <,,> what shall we say  
evaluate <,,> <w> we'll </w> try to <,> uh enhance the influence of Indian  
geography and the culture <,,> of its people on the <,> one hand and how the  
challenge of geography has also been met on the other <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#81:1:A>
Now let us come to physical facts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-040#82:1:A>
Now this physical facts uh <,,> which have uh directly or  
indirectly <,> influenced the history of civilisation of India <,> and it has  
been the size of the country and its comparative isolation <,,> uh <,,>  
afforded by <,,> the Himalayas <,,> </I>
