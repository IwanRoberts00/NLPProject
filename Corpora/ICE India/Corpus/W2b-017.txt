<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> movement for a
constitutional amendment to include the right to work in the list of
Fundamental Rights, which was launched in June, 1986, by the Citizens for
Democracy in association with a number of trade union organizations, has
gathered considerable momentum since then.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#5:1>
The demand was accepted by the National Front and was incorporated in
its election manifesto.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#6:1>
There is every reason to believe that, after coming to power, the
National Front Government intends to implement that election pledge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#7:1>
In an important paper prepared and published at the time of
launching the right to work movement, Dr. Dalip Swamy pointed out that
unemployment had increased from 5.3 million in 1951 to 27.9 million by April,
1986, and that about 350 million people in the country were below the
poverty lilne.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#8:1>
This vast number indicates that underemployment is a more potent
cause of mass poverty than total unemployment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#9:1>
The right to work movement aims at ensuring full employment to all
those who desire to be occupied in gainful work. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#10:1>
<h> <bold> UNEMPLOYMENT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#11:1>
Dr. Dalip Swamy emphasized that unemployment is mainly
concentrated in rural areas and that it prevails among poor cultivators,
agricultural labourers and women.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#12:1>
Employment has failed to keep pace with the growth of population,
with the result that unemployment has been growing year after year.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#13:1>
Agricultural holdings are being sub-divided due to the increase in
population and rural households have been forced to operate on
regressively smaller plots of land. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#14:1>
What is more, there has been a continuous increase in the
capital-labour ratio - - the ratio between the capital invested and the
workers employed - - since 1956.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#15:1>
Even excluding capital-intensive industries, the requirement of
capital per worker increased from <indig> Rs. </indig> 20,266 in 1973-74
to <indig> Rs. </indig> 54,869 in 1982-83.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#16:1>
The paper pointed out that from 1973-74 to 1982-83, capital grew
almost four times faster than employment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#17:1>
The figures available after Dr <w> Swamy's </w> paper indicate
that the increase in the capital-labour ratio has been more rapid than he
estimated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#18:1>
It has been found that in the whole private industrial sector in
the country, there was hardly any increase in employment between 1980 and
1988 although private capital must have atleast doubled during that period.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#19:1>
This shows that even rapid growth in capital-intensive industry
offers no solution to growing unemployment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#20:1>
Mass poverty has been the main economic problem before us since
before Independence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#21:1>
Nearly four decades of economic planning have not made a palpable
dent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#22:1>
Further economic development in the same direction promises little
relief to the bulk of our people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#23:1>
The purpose of the right to work movement is to require the
Government and the Planning Commission to change the direction of economic
development and to ensure that planning will be labour-intensive and not
capital-intensive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#24:1>
It is worthy of note that basic needs - - food, water, shelter,
clothing, education and health care - - are met by economic activities
which are labour-intensive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#25:1>
The proposed change in the direction of economic development
therefore implies not only a change from capital-intensive to
labour-intensive economic activities, but also a change in favour of the
production and supply of goods and services which would satisfy the basic
needs of the vast majority of the people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#26:1>
The luxuries sought by the upper strata of society will continue
to be produced, but they will constitute a minor part of the total
economic product. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#27:1>
There are, however, some seriious objections to the proposal
of the right to work being made a Fundamental Right under the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#28:1>
It is necessary to examine the validity of these objections.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#29:1>
First, if the right to work is made, a fundamental right, any person
who is presently jobless can apply to the High Court or the Supreme Court
in order to mandate the state to give him a job.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#30:1>
Such a scheme would obviously be unworkable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#31:1>
Secondly, the right to work implies that whenever the state is
unable to provide a job to the jobless, it must give employment relief in the
form of a dole.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#32:1>
This is hardly possible in the present stage of economic development
of the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#33:1>
Thirdly, it is implicit in the demand for the right to work
that the responsibility of finding employment is taken away from the
unemployed and imposed on the state.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#34:1>
Is it proper, it is asked, that the state should be called upon to
discharge the responsibility of providing jobs to all those who are
unemployed? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#35:1>
The first two objections can be easily met.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#36:1>
It is not proposed that any jobless person should be able to approach
a court of law without adopting a procedure prescribed by a suitable law.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#37:1>
Nor is it proposed that the right to work should not be subject to
reasonable restrictions arising from the economic stringency of the state.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#38:1>
All fundamental rights are subject to reasonable restrictions, <O>
in box below </O> and the right to work will not be an exception to the rule.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#39:1>
In a seminar where the above two objections were discussed; the
present writer proposed by way of clarification that the demand could be
implemented by inserting in the Constitution an Article 21-A, in the
following or similar terms : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#40:1>
<quote> " All citizens above the age of 18 have the right to work
which will be secured by a law of parliament embodying an
employment-guarantee scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#41:1>
The right to work will be subject to reasonable restrictions imposed
on account of unavoidable financial stringency of the state." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#42:1>
This amendment specifies, in the first place, that the right to
work will be secured through a Central law which will provide for an
employment-guarantee scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#43:1>
Such a state law, in fact, has prevailed in Maharashtra for the last
12 years, and although it is confined to rural areas and requries
improvement in material particulars, it has provided substantial benefit
to a number of jobless people living in rural areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#44:1>
The Maharashtra law lays down that any unemployed person in a
village can apply to a certain revenue authority for a job, and it will be
duty of that authority to provide a job to him at minimum wages within a
period of 15 days.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#45:1>
If a job is not provided, unemployment relief must be given on a
modest scale for his maintenance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#46:1>
The scheme makes it incumbent that economic planning in rural areas
should be such that an adequate number of jobs are available to those who are
wholly unemployed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#47:1>
To extend such an unemployment-guarantee scheme to urban areas
is not difficult.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#48:1>
The main problem in Indian cities and towns relates to the provision
of housing accommodation to hundreds of thousands of people who have to
live on pavements or in illegal makeshift hutments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#49:1>
According to research papers produced on the subject, most of these
pavement and hutment dwellers have some employment and can afford to pay a
modest rent for moderately decent accommodation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#50:1>
Large-scale housing schemes in urban areas can thus provide
employment to thousands of workmen without causing a severe economic
shortage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#51:1>
Thus the first two common objections to the right to work being made
a fundamental right are not as formidable as they appear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#52:1>
The third objection is more serious.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#53:1>
It assumes that if the state does not interfere in the economic
process, the problem of unemployment and, consequently, of mass poverty
will be solved by the automatic functioning of a free-enterprise market
economy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#54:1>
This assumption necessarily means that economic planning by the state
is wholly redundant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#55:1>
The best that a state can do to ensure the economic progress of the
people is to adopt a policy of non-interference in economic affairs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#56:1>
This policy of <foreign> laissez-faire </foreign> is approved by
a large number of economists, particularly in Western countries, although
they are also in favour of a minimum regulatory function of the state,
illustrated by such legislation as the Factories Act which provides for the
maximum number of working hours, minimum number of holidays and certain other
facilities to industrial workers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#57:1>
Can the policy of <foreign> laissez-faire </foreign> solve the
problem of mass poverty, unemployment and large-scale underemployment in
countries like India? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#58:1>
State interference by economic planning is necessary in countries
such as ours in order to ensure that a larger share of resources is diverted
to labour-intensive economic activities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#59:1>
Left to itself, free enterprise would result in the development of
capital-intensive industry, as has happened in India in the last 30 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#60:1>
Planning, therefore, is necessary, and planning must be oriented
towards employment generation. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#61:1>
<h> <bold> DEVELOPMENT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#62:1>
Such employment-oriented economic development can take place in
India in both the rural and urban sectors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#63:1>
Most of the unemployment is concentrated in the rural sector and that
is why the economic development of this sector should be the pivot of Indian
planning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#64:1>
Improvement in agriculture will itself absorb a good deal more
labour, much as by the adoption of schemes of reclamation of waste-lands,
digging of field channels, contour bunding, prevention of soil erosion, and
elimination of floods and waterlogging.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#65:1>
A large number of small irrigation projects can be a source of
substantial employment generation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#66:1>
It is thus feasible to include the right to work in the
Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#67:1>
It would indeed be a revolutionary step, for it will go a long way in
solving the basic problem of mass poverty in India. </p> <O> box in column

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#68:1>
<it> <bold> <smallcaps> INCORPORATING </smallcaps> </bold> the right to
work as a part of the Fundamental Rights is fraught with difficulties.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#69:1>
But argues V.M. Tarkunde, the former judge and human rights
activist, employment-oriented national planning can go a long way in
making the concept feasible. </it> </box> </I>

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#76:2>
It is cold again in Delhi and I am overcome with nostalgia for
Kashmiri food.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#77:2>
The afternoon shadows are beginning to lengthen as we drive up to the
shabby looking Hotel Broadway on Asaf Ali Road on the fringes of old Delhi,
to sample their Kashmiri food in their restaurant with the bizarre name of
<mention> Chor Bizarre </mention> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#78:2>
The last time I entered this hotel was as a college student two
decades ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#79:2>
It was a posh and fashionable place then and I remember through the
aromatic mists of time how we would devour their hot <indig> <it> tandoori
</it> </indig> offerings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#80:2>
Chor Bizarre is also known for its <indig> <it> tandoori </it>
</indig> delicacies which have been given a good chit by my friends Karen and
Gul Anand in their useful and very readable <it> Penguin Food Lovers Guide to
India and Nepal </it> , but their most descriptive paragraphs have been
reserved for the Kashmiri Wazwaan ( Kashmiri Muslim Feast) served here.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#81:2>
<w> I'm </w> taken around the restaurant to see the outlandish
furnishings lifted from various Chor Bazaars around the country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#82:2>
Much has been made of the four-poster which has been turned into a
table or the 1927 Fiat - - the <indig> Chaat </indig> Mobile - - which has an
array of vegetarian salads, <indig> <it> chaats </it> </indig> and desserts
under its bonnet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#83:2>
The restaurant has a pleasing ambience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#84:2>
I am less impressed with their Thugs Bar.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#85:2>
The paintings of villains from Hindi films are amateurish and the
atmosphere is seedy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#86:2>
Perhaps it is meant to be so.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#87:2>
The names of the drinks, though, are interesting and good for a laugh
- - or a refill.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#88:2>
My friend orders a <indig> ` Kalia' </indig> - - a rum and coke - -
and I sip an <indig> <quote> ` Arre O samba' </quote> </indig> - - a whisky
sour in honour of my excellent friend, of the same name, screen villain
Macmohan, who could have had his picture up here too.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#89:2>
The whisky is too sour for my liking and I switch to a Bloody Mary
entitled <quote> ` Mona Darrling' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#90:2>
We are now in the right frame of mind for the abbreviated <indig>
<quote> ` Wazwaan' </quote> </indig> or Kashmiri feast.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#91:2>
My friend concentrates on rice and <indig> <it> yakhni </it> </indig>
- - meat cooked in <indig> <it> dahi </it> </indig> over a slow fire.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#92:2>
He shares some of my <indig> <it> palak </it> </indig> , cooked in
the <indig> <quote> ` Haak' </quote> </indig> or <indig> <quote> ` Karam Ka
Saag' </quote> </indig> style.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#93:2>
Good <indig> haak </indig> is not easily available in Delhi and
<indig> <it> palak </it> </indig> is a tasty substitute.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#94:2>
In a traditional <indig> Wazwaan </indig> comprising more than 50
items including exotic <indig> chutneys </indig> , the food is served in a
<indig> <it> trami </it> </indig> or large bowl.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#95:2>
The rice is heaped high on the bowl and four people sit around it and
eat from the same <indig> trami </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#96:2>
A wall of rice separates you from your <w> companion's </w> territory
and the <indig> <it> wazas </it> </indig> or cooks come around and serve you
the dainty meat preparations, one by one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#97:2>
Literally so, because there are no second helpings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#98:2>
There are so many courses, all delicious, that it would be vulgar to
ask for seconds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#99:2>
But here there are only four or five items and I go for another
helping of the <indig> <it> rista </it> </indig> , finely pounded balls of
mince meat in a fine red sauce.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#100:2>
There is a crisp piece of <indig> <it> tabakmaaz </it> </indig> (
fried ribs) on my plate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#101:2>
A promising beginning to the meal, coupled with <indig> <it> haak (
palak), dam aloo, </it> </indig> and beaten <indig> <it> dahi </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#102:2>
The great disappointment, though, is the <indig> <it> goshtaba </it>
</indig> the royal dish, a large white ball of minced <O> photograph below
the main heading, column three & four </O> <O> caption </O> <*> line from
left to right</*> meat, redolent with the <indig> <it> dahi </it> </indig>
and spices in which it is cooked for hours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#103:2>
This <indig> <it> goshtaba </it> </indig> tastes dry and dense.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#104:2>
It does not have the springy, juicy texture of the real thing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#105:2>
The <indig> <it> phirni ( kheer) </it> </indig> has to be
abandoned.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#106:2>
Surely this is not Kashmiri <indig> <it> phirni </it> </indig> ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#107:2>
It is too thick and hard and did I detect, horrors, some coconut in
it? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#108:2>
The Kashmiri tea is fair but in a place like <mention> Chor
Bizarre </mention> it would be innovative to serve it in an original Kashmiri
<indig> <it> samovar </it> </indig> ( preferably stolen). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#109:2>
It is nearly five <w> O'clock </w> in the evening and we are
stuffed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#110:2>
The day has passed well, even without counting the apertifs at the
<w> Thug's </w> Bar! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#111:2>
The following morning I find myself automatically, almost
ritualistically drawn like a magnet to the Bengali Sweet House at Bengali
Market and its tempting variety of hot and cold <indig> chaat </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#112:2>
Bengali Market has been synonymous with Bengali Sweet House ever
since I can remember.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#113:2>
Karen and Gul Anand in their <it> Food <w> Lovers' </w> Guide </it>
speak lovingly of <quote> ` <w> Natu's </w> ' </quote> which sprang up
opposite.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#114:2>
I have eaten there and have no complaints.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#115:2>
But my loyalties lie with Bengali Sweet House whose <indig> <it>
chaat </it> </indig> has hastened my growth into manhood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#116:2>
Time stands still as I devour huge <indig> <it> golguppas </it>
</indig> dipped in iced, spiced <indig> <it> pani </it> </indig> , followed
compulsorily by <indig> <it> papri chaat </it> </indig> , which includes
<indig> <it> papri </it> </indig> , potatoes, <indig> <it> dahiwadas </it>
</indig> in beaten <indig> <it> dahi </it> </indig> with just the right
spicing and a sprinkle of ginger slivers and pomegranate seeds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#117:2>
Next follows the crisp <indig> <it> tikia </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#118:2>
There is nothing like it in Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#119:2>
The anaemic and rubbery <indig> <it> ragra pattice </it> </indig> is
no match for this full-bodied potato cutlet with dark savoury <indig> <it>
chole </it> </indig> , superbly flavoured green and red <indig> chutney
</indig> with a helping of chopped onions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#120:2>
And last in the ritual is a steaming hot <indig> <it> gulab jamun
</it> </indig> , straight from the smoking <indig> <it> kadhai </it> </indig>
before us.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#121:2>
No further meal is required for the day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-017#122:2>
And if it is, look for it in the gracious environment of India
International Centre at Lodi Estate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#123:2>
Of course, one needs to be a member but you can get in as a guest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#124:2>
The Centre is the most affordable place in Delhi for its luxurious
ambience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#125:2>
Its frawling gardens.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#126:2>
And it serves the best range of food under one roof.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#127:2>
Mixed Punjabi Mughlai menus in Chinese restaurants are to be
scrupulously avoided but seated in the elegant dining hall of the Centre with
its huge picture windows one can order spinach soup and spaghetti, roast
chicken, beef steak and steamed fish and be sure of superb flavour each time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#128:2>
And if you request executive chef Vijay Kumar early enough you could
be served Chicken Monaco ( boneless chicken in sherry sauce garnished with
cubes of capsicum, olives and mushrooms), or Fish Walasca ( fish stuffed with
prawns in wine sauce). The Chinese food is as good and served on a hot plate.
After reading all this you will be astonished to find that the most popular
item at the Centre is still their <it> <indig> tandoori </indig> </it> food.
My disappointment of the month - - or decade if you please - - was dining at
<w> gulati's, </w> the <it> <indig> tandoori </indig> </it> speciality
restaurant at Pandara Road.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#129:2>
I did not need Karen and Gul <w> Anand's </w> recommendation to
visit it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#130:2>
I have eaten here many times before.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#131:2>
The <it> <indig> tandoori </indig> </it> food has always been
outstanding and I have been impressed by its one innovation not witnessed by
me in any other restaurant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#132:2>
The <it> <indig> tandoori </indig> </it> food is served sealed in
silver foil to preserve its heat and juices.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#133:2>
But not any more.

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#134:2>
My memories are of a long time ago. I took two friends from Europe
specially for the imagined treat but it was a disappointment on all counts
except for <indig> kalmi Kabab </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-017#135:2>
The <it> <indig> tandoori </indig> </it> platter was smothering in a
