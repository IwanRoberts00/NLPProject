<ICE-IND:S2A-041#1:1:A>
As uh <,> my <indig> guru </indig> is here <,,> I can breath  
more freely <,> uhm <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#2:1:A>
And he is going to <,> record my <,> talk also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#3:1:A>
Well I <,> selected this topic <,> <mention> E L L <,> English  
Language Learning </mention> <,> uhm we have <,> read and heard so much about  
E L T now <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#4:1:A>
Perhaps <,,> you may find it interesting and this is the last period  
uhm <,> so I don't want you to be bored <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#5:1:A>
So this is a new topic <,> uhm <mention> E L L </mention> <,,> uhn  
not quite new <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#6:1:A>
You know that <,> second language learning and first language  
learning <,> first language learning <-> is at </-> <,,> takes place <,> uhm  
early in childhood <,> and it is acquired you know <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#7:1:A>
And second language learning <,> takes place when we are <,,> adult  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#8:1:A>
So it is learned <,,> uhm 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#9:1:A>
So acquisition and learning while this <,> <O> cough </O> uh <,,>  
differentiation you know acquisition and learning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#10:1:A>
But here <,,> <w> I'm </w> putting before you <,> a new outlook  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#11:1:A>
Even <,> second language learning <,> is acquisition like first  
language acquisition <,,> because <,> to acquire second language <,,> is <,,>  
to take an additional language <,,> after having acquired one language <,,>  
after having fully acquired one language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#12:1:A>
So <,> <w> that's </w> why we call it second language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#13:1:A>
Now what the difference between <,> the two learner <,,> L one  
learner and L two learner <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#14:1:A>
Now <,,> if we observe L one learner <,,> we can very easily see  
<,,> that even their proficiency is at very low level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#15:1:A>
Well <,,> they <,> never hesitate <,> using <,,> their first  
language <,,> for you can observe children <,,> uh you can observe <,,> uh  
around you <,> so many you see persons even <,> those persons who never go to  
school <,> uhm especially children <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#16:1:A>
Now if we observe L two learner second language learner <,,> they  
are mostly adult <,,> because <,,> if they are not adults <,,> and if first  
language and second language <,,> uhm if a child acquires <,> then even that  
second language is like first language <,> uhm if the child acquire  
simultaneously <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#17:1:A>
And as we are adult <,> we are more cognitively mature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#18:1:A>
Second language learners are more cognitively mature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#19:1:A>
They <-> are </-> <,,> have <,> more metalinguistic awareness 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#20:1:A>
Well this is word this is sentence this is phrase <,> know  
metalinguistic awareness <,,> second language learner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#21:1:A>
And they have more word knowledge <,,> say this is the difference  
between <,,> uh L one learners and L two learners <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#22:1:A>
Now in learning L two <,,> we observe two psychological processes  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#23:1:A>
Now one is <,,> simplification <,> and another is over  
generalisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#24:1:A>
Now L two learner <,,> shall have this tendency of simplification  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#25:1:A>
Well he <,,> while learning <,> target language or second language  
<,> well he tries to simplify <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#26:1:A>
Well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level  
<,> even at syntactic level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#27:1:A>
And there are many jokes also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#28:1:A>
Now here is one example <,,> uhm from morphological level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#29:1:A>
<mention> Two chicken </mention> <,,> <mention> many bird  
</mention> <,,> well plural form <,,> plural form <,,> well is missing here  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#30:1:A>
<mention> Many bird many birds </mention> you know <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#31:1:A>
But <mention> many bird two chicken </mention> <,,> now this occurs  
at the morphological level <,> simplification <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#32:1:A>
Well there is no need of <mention> birds </mention> <,> because  
there is <mention> many </mention> <,,> <mention> birds </mention> is not  
needed because there is <mention> many </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#33:1:A>
Then <,,> uh you may take even the language of telegram <,,>  
language of telegram 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#34:1:A>
Now this is simplification at the syntactic level <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#35:1:A>
Well <,> refresher course ends tomorrow <,> I I don't know when  
ends you know <,,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#36:1:A>
But you may <}> <-> telegram </-> <+> send a telegram </+> </}>  
<mention> Refresher course ends tomorrow <,> uhm home Sunday or Monday or <,>  
uhm <,> whatever day it is </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#37:1:A>
Now here <,,> uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#38:1:A>
Well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#39:1:A>
Then <,,> well there are many examples of over generalisation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#40:1:A>
Uhn L two learners <,> uhm uh over generalise it <,> at all  
linguistic levels again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#41:1:A>
Say <,> instead of using <,,> specific verbs like <mention> fly <,>  
run <,,> </mention> well he uses the nuclear verb like <mention> go  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#42:1:A>
Now go <,> is a nuclear verb you know it is <,> cover term you see  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#43:1:A>
Instead of using <,> specific verbs like <mention> run fly travel  
</mention> etcetera he uses <mention> go </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#44:1:A>
Well this is one example of <,> over generalisation <,> you see at  
the lexical level <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#45:1:A>
Now where the morphological level I think you know <,,> <}> <-> <.>  
wh </.> </-> <=> when </=> </}> you assess <,> you see <,> uh the writing of  
your students you may come across many of them <,> instead of <mention> went  
gone </mention> <,,> instead of <,,> <mention> you now went gone </mention>  
instead of <,> children <,> <mention> child </mention> <,,> instead of  
<mention> children </mention> you know <,,> <mention> child </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#46:1:A>
So this occurs at the morphological level <,> uhm over  
generalisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#47:1:A>
So <,,> first thing we observe <,,> in this L two learning <,,> is  
L two learning is not linear or cumulative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#48:1:A>
We do not go on adding the structures one by one <,> or we do not  
learn them all at a time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#49:1:A>
You see this L two learning is <,,> uh neither linear nor  
cumulative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#50:1:A>
But this is <,> somewhat U shaped <,,> you know U shape learning  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#51:1:A>
Now I will explain this uh unfortunately I don't have a piece of  
chalk and duster you know 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#52:1:A>
But <,> uh I will try to explain <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#53:1:A>
Well in the beginning <,> when learning is <,,> almost <}> <->  
mechanic </-> <+> mechanical </+> </}> <,,> say the right use of the <,,>  
right use of plural suffix <mention> s </mention> or <mention> es </mention>  
<,> L two learner you see catches it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#54:1:A>
And <,,> in terms of accuracy <,,> in terms of accuracy <,> well he  
<,,> must be given hundred percent mark <,,> that is the beginning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#55:1:A>
But this learning is mechanic <,,> this learning is <}> <->  
mechanic </-> <+> mechanical </+> </}> he is accurate <,> he learns  
mechanically <,> as we say know parrot learning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#56:1:A>
So <,> and then <,,> his level of accuracy falls down <,,> well he  
he begins to commit error <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#57:1:A>
He begins to commit error <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#58:1:A>
His level of accuracy falls down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#59:1:A>
And then again it rises this level rises <,,> so <w> that's </w>  
why you know I said U shaped <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#60:1:A>
U shape learning L two learning is U shape <,,> and even first  
language learning is also U shape <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#61:1:A>
So first <,,> there is high level of accuracy <,> and then low  
level then again high level of accuracy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#62:1:A>
There are three stages <,,> first stage <,> high level second stage  
low level third stage again <,> high level <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#63:1:A>
Here <,,> this U shaped <,,> learning strategy <,,> U shape  
learning strategy that L two learner uses <,> while learning <,> second  
language <,> is worth considering seriously <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#64:1:A>
Unless <,,> we know <,> how our students learn second language <,>  
no methods will be useful <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#65:1:A>
We will never be successful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#66:1:A>
We will never be successful 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#67:1:A>
Uhm let me tell you once again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#68:1:A>
Well we should know them how they learn <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#69:1:A>
What strategies they use <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#70:1:A>
Uh what are the processes that take place while learning L two <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#71:1:A>
And this is very important process <,> uhm U shaped learning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#72:1:A>
Now there are <,> three stages <,> let me repeat again <,> first  
stage <,> mechanical learning <,> when we go on adding the structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#73:1:A>
Second stage <,,> second stage <,,> when accuracy falls down <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#74:1:A>
Now this <,,> takes place <,,> because <,,> once a structure is  
mechanically learn <,,> once a structure is mechanically learnt <,> the whole  
system is again restructured <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#75:1:A>
The whole system is again refined <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#76:1:A>
Uhm whatever language <,,> proficiency the second language learner  
has <,> it is again disturbed <,> when new information is added when new  
structure is learned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#77:1:A>
Now <,> the whole structure is <,> you see renewed again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#78:1:A>
Now this is the second stage <,> <w> that's </w> why the learner  
<,> you see makes <,> many mistakes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#79:1:A>
He commits many error <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#80:1:A>
Now third stage <,> after restructuring the system <,,> again his  
accuracy level rises <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#81:1:A>
He makes no mistakes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#82:1:A>
Well he <,,> well his proficiency level also rises <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#83:1:A>
So this U shape development <,,> is very important process in  
second language learning <,,> because <,,> it deals with the error that the  
learner makes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#84:1:A>
Yes <,,> if <,> we consider these errors <,,> then <,,> we can know  
our students or <,> second language learner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#85:1:A>
But we teacher <,,> pay very little attention to our <,> to our  
student <,> to the error that they commit <,> to the mistakes you know that  
they make while learning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#86:1:A>
Now it is part of their on going process of learning second  
language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#87:1:A>
Well making you see mistakes <,> or committing error <,,> well it  
is part of the process of learning second language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#88:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why <,> we should take it <,> very serious we  
as teacher <,,> and try to analyse <,,> the the error that they make <,> and  
then judge or decide <,> the level of proficiency uhm <,> they they have  
achieved <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#89:1:A>
Now <,,> there are two kinds of error they make <,> or two sets of  
errors they make <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#90:1:A>
Now first is <,,> interlingua error <,,> <&> B B writing </&>  
interlingual error <,,> well <,> they are interfrance error <,,> <&> B B  
writing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#91:1:A>
And second <,,> intralingual <,,> intralingual <,> error <,,> <&> B  
B writing </&> they are developmental error <,,> <&> B B writing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#92:1:A>
Now these errors <,,> interlingual error <,,> are mostly  
interfrance error <,> our <,,> see first language interfrance interferes with  
the <,> second language learning <,,> and uh <,> we we find our student <,>  
transfering <,,> you see the the features of their first language to their  
second language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#93:1:A>
This we can identify very easily <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#94:1:A>
Now intralingual error <,> these are the developmental error <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#95:1:A>
They are part of the development of <,,> you see the student or the  
learner <,> in second language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#96:1:A>
So here you know I say <,> it is <O> one word </O> <,,> <&> B B  
writing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#97:1:A>
It is part of the process of learning <,> second language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#98:1:A>
Now <,,> interlingual error <,,> are error <,,> because of our  
attitude you know behaviourist <,> or what you call see <,> even <,,>  
structural I call bahaviourist <,,> <&> B B writing </&> or product <,>  
oriented <,,> <&> B B writing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#99:1:A>
And this is process oriented <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#100:1:A>
Well here I have in my mind <,> the teacher versus <,> the  
researcher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#101:1:A>
Now for me teacher is more important <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#102:1:A>
Now researcher may level it anything <,> but we must be able to  
identify it among our student <,> among the learner that they come to us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#103:1:A>
So we must be able to identify <,> you see <,,> these interlingual  
error <,,> uhm which are the product of our view to language learning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#104:1:A>
Our view <,> uhm towards language learning if our view is product  
oriented <,,> we find these errors <,,> but if our view is process oriented  
<,,> if we think that learning second language is a process <,> you see then  
<,> the errors are <,> intralingual error <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#105:1:A>
So this I leave to the teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#106:1:A>
Now <,,> here <,,> one important thing <,> must be noted <,,> at  
every stage of learning <,,> the second language learner <,,> at every stage  
of learning the second language learner <,> has his own language which is  
called interlanguage <,,> <&> B B writing </&> interlanguage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#107:1:A>
And this interlanguage lies somewhere between <,> first language  
and second language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#108:1:A>
But it is the learners language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#109:1:A>
It is the learners language <,> at every stage the learner <,> you  
see <,> arrives at <,> his own language and that is his interlanguage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#110:1:A>
It is always under fluctuation <,> changing <,> because it is <,>  
part of the process <,,> it is part of the process <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#111:1:A>
Now this interlanguage theory <,,> you see developed in about  
nineteen sixty-nine <,> well is very important <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#112:1:A>
Now it is nothing but an <?> interium </?> grammar <,,> it is  
nothing but an <?> interium </?> grammar that the second language learner  
develops <,,> or L two learner develops <,> on his way to target language  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#113:1:A>
On his way to <,> when going towards on his way to target language  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#114:1:A>
It is an <?> interium </?> grammar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#115:1:A>
Now it is in itself a system <,,> distinct from L one and L two  
first language and <,> second language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#116:1:A>
And this is the language that we as teachers first understand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#117:1:A>
If we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner  
<,,> yes we will be a success <,,> well <,,> in what you say <,> teaching the  
language and they will be success in learning the language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#118:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> Ou </.> </-> <=> our </=> </}> own strategy of  
presenting our material <,> asking them to do some task <,> you see our way  
of guiding them will depend upon <,> our knowledge of this interlanguage of  
the second language learner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#119:1:A>
Now here <,,> I don't say we fail <,,> we <,> I don't say we fail  
<,> but <,,> well we we ignore to to some extent <,,> well we we take liberty  
to to some extent <,,> and here <,,> you see what I say we go away from our  
student <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#120:1:A>
If we are language teacher <,,> we must <,> make our best to  
identify this interlanguage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#121:1:A>
At what stage <,,> the process of learning the second language  
learning is now <,,> you see if a teacher knows this he knows his student <,>  
he knows the process <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#122:1:A>
He will be able to guide and he is the best teacher <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#123:1:A>
Uhm well in in my opinion <,> a teacher knowing <,,> all the  
methods of teaching <,> is not a good teacher <,,> <&> laughter </&> uh uh  
the teacher one who knows his student well <,> one who knows his learners  
well is the good teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#124:1:A>
Then only you will be able to guide <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#125:1:A>
If <,,> now there are uh <,> many level given to this <,>  
interlanguage <,> uhm I don't <,,> you see waste <,> your time on it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#126:1:A>
But <,,> interlanguage <,,> is very curious <,,> you see how a a  
learner reaches that stage of interlanguage <,,> uhm is very interesting to  
know <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#127:1:A>
Well this <,,> process takes place <,> in a certain sequence in a  
certain order <,,> and this sequence this order <,> well you may call  
acquisition order <,,> language acquisition order <,> or <,,> you may say  
developmental sequence <,,> <&> B B writing </&> developmental sequence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#128:1:A>
Well this is psychological process <,,> and only <,> researcher  
can know this uhm how how it takes place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#129:1:A>
Well we we teacher <,,> can judge it <,> only by the results that  
we get from the student <,,> uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well  
<,> how this process takes place <,> process of <,> forming ones own  
interlanguage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#130:1:A>
But this is not <,,> uhm formed by mechanical learning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#131:1:A>
Now this is formed <,,> by following this acquisition order <,,>  
or developmental sequence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#132:1:A>
You see developmental sequence now <,> uh I will mention two <,,>  
well uh <,> project <,,> you see undertaken and also completed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-041#133:1:A>
One was on interrogative <,,> and another was on negative <,,>  
</I>
