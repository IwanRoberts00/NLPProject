<ICE-IND:S2A-003#2:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar in attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#3:1:B>
To Sanjoy Mitra <,,> Sanjoy Das the captain <,,> is <,,> looking at
the box but referee waves play on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#4:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar playing the three mid field players <,,> three forwards
<,,> and <,,> five defenders <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#5:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow <,,> attacking to Veer Bahadur Thapa <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#6:1:B>
Now <w> it's </w> Rajan Kumar <,,> Kuldeep left footer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#7:1:B>
Comfortably collected <,,> by Vimal Das <,,> the Bidhan Nagar goal
keeper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#8:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow trailing zero one <,,> in this Subrato
Mukherjee Cup final <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#9:1:B>
And the substitution <,,> being made <,,> by Bidhan Nagar <,,> Vimal
<,,> no it is Raja Chatterjee <,> <w> who's </w> coming on <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#10:1:B>
Raja Chatterjee <,,> the number thirteen <w> who'll </w> come on
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#11:1:B>
And coming out is the number twelve <,,> that is Santosh Gupta <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#12:1:B>
So Raja Chatterjee will come in <,> in the next back position <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#13:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar <,> in attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#14:1:B>
Once again <,,> to Sanjoy Das <,> the skipper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#15:1:B>
This is in the second half Bidhan Nagar leading their opponent
Sports College Lucknow one nil in the <}> <-> nineteen </-> <=> nineteen </=>
</}> ninety- <?> one </?> final <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#16:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar has lost three nil <,> to Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#17:1:B>
So if Bidhan Nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the
Subrato Cup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#18:1:B>
And as their coach <,,> Surjit Kumar Ghosh said it will be sweet
revenge <,> for the defeat in nineteen ninety-one <,> when they lost zero
three to Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#19:1:B>
Referee Joji <,,> awards <,,> foul <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#20:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar player pulled up for stamping <,,> and a free kick to
Sports College Lucknow which they will take just near the centre line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#21:1:B>
Long high free kick <,,> but not much danger comfortably collected
by <,> Vimal Das <,,> the goalkeeper as he collect it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#22:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar <,> in attack through <,,> Sanjoy Das <,,> their
skipper <,,> a good through pass <,,> but <,> <w> it's </w> clear for a
corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#23:1:B>
Corner kick will be taken from the far right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#24:1:B>
Some clearance <,,> and the ball goes into touch <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#25:1:B>
Now <,> Sports College Lucknow <,> Hemchandra Joshi <,,> throwing
the ball but losing out again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#26:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar skipper Sanjoy Das trying to build up an attack <,>
for the off side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#27:1:B>
So Bidhan Nagar still <,> clinging on to that one nil lead and if
they maintained this lead <,,> they will have achieved their ambition of
bringing the Subrato Cup they have been pass getting the Subrato Cup since
nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety <,> semi-finalist again
in ninety-nine <,> in ninteen ninety-two <,> and runners up in nineteen
ninety-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#28:1:B>
But they have yet to win the tournament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#29:1:B>
Aimless football even this early <,> part of the second half <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#30:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar <,,> have the distinction of having <,,> reach the
final without having conceded a goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#31:1:B>
In their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil <,,> and then
were held cold <,> by <O> one word </O> Shillong <,> in the quarter final
they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat <,,> the school from Ranchi
three nil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#32:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow from the near right <,,> but well cleared by
Bidhan Nagar <,,> Raja Chatterjee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#33:1:B>
Long clearance this could be dangerous

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#34:1:B>
A chance by Sports College Lucknow <,,> mid fielder Lalit Singh
takes a very weak try <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#35:1:B>
Mid field action <,,> not much constructed football <,,> and
referee Joji giving <,,> awarding a <,,> foul to Bidhan Nagar because <,,>
one of Sports College Lucknow player <,,> obstructed <,,> Bidhan Nagar
defender <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#36:1:B>
So <,,> <w> it's </w> a long <,,> clearance Bidhan Nagar in attack
<,> from the near left <,> through Raja Chatterjee the overlapping left back
<,> a long left footer <,,> but <,> the ball goes obviously wide <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#37:1:B>
Manoj Singh <,,> long high goal kick <,,> but the ball goes into
touch <,> on the near right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#38:1:B>
Still Bidhan Nagar one <,> Sports College Lucknow nil <,> and Kamal
Ghosh the prolofic scorer <,,> for Bidhan Nagar scored this goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#39:1:B>
Now Raja Chatterjee with the ball <,> dribbles well <,,> attempted
to pass but <,> mis direction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#40:1:B>
Suddenly Bidhan Nagar seem to have become a bit hasty

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#41:1:B>
As time is running out <,,> they are getting anxious to hold on to
this lead <,> which could be long tactics because the break away move Sports
College Lucknow <,> could equalise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#42:1:B>
The ball is not of a very high quality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#43:1:B>
Both teams <,> tense and anxious <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#44:1:B>
Now this Arbind Mhatra <,> <w> who's </w> cleared <,,> the ball out
of danger for Bidhan Nagar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#45:1:B>
See Bidhan Nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these
<,,> tussles of the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#46:1:B>
And referee Joji calls up <,,> for medical assistance

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#47:1:B>
And there will be a slight hold up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#48:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar <,,> high school from fourth lane in Calcutta adopted
by the sports authorities of India <,> our leading Sports College Lucknow by
one nil

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#49:1:B>
Both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#50:1:B>
The Sports College Lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#51:1:B>
But this time Bidhan Nagar <,> has <,,> have the initiative <,,>
they have been the more dominating team <,> but they are not really being
able to translate their dominance <,> into goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#52:1:B>
Approach plays good <,> but near the goal <,> hasty passes <,,>
leads to impossession <,> in attack and break up of the attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#53:1:B>
So it is <,,> Bidhan Nagar Shonkar Das receiving assistance <,,>
medical attendant <,,> near the goal line <,,> near the goal and play will
resume

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#54:1:B>
Referee Joji insist <,,> goal keeper goes to see him

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#55:1:B>
And there will be long <}> <-> goal keep </-> <,,> <=> goal kick
</=> </}> by Parmanand Karmakar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#56:1:B>
Shankor Das also <,,> leaps back onto the field <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#57:1:B>
Now Bidhan Nagar <,,> in attack this could be dangerous <,,> but
Komal Ghosh <,> <?> looked </?> <,,> as he trys to touch the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#58:1:B>
And on the break <,> for Sports College Lucknow <,,> is <,> there
<,> number twelve Salim Javed <,,> Salim Javed to Veer Bahudar Thapa <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#59:1:B>
And a long aimless kick which sails over the bar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#60:1:B>
Lalit Rathod and Veer Bahadur Thapa were the main striker for
Sports College Lucknow <,> on their way to the final <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#61:1:B>
But they have made very little impact <,,> against the tight
marking Bidhan Nagar defence <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#62:1:B>
Now Imad Hussein the left winger attacking <,> for <,> Sports
College Lucknow <,,> takes a good returned pass <,> attempts across <,> but
<,,> is unsuccessful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#63:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow trying to build up attack through from the
left to Imad Hussein <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#64:1:B>
And Lalit Rathod with the ball <,,> solo pass but <,,> <w> it's
</w> the referee <,,> pulls up this tackle by <,,> Sanjoy Das <,,> he
accidently handle the ball while tackling <,,> and throw a free kick <,,>
from a reasonably dangerous position <,> if they have a hard hitting striker
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#65:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#66:1:B>
Standing there is Vishal Prasad and Lalit Singh and let us see who
takes it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#67:1:B>
Lalit Singh <,,> serving the free kick just <,,> goes over the bar
<,> of course <,> goal keeper Vimal Das has seen it well and so there was no
danger <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#68:1:B>
And referee waves <,,> ask for play to resume <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#69:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#70:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow <,,> Salim Javed <,,> losing out to Komal
Ghosh Komal Ghosh pulled up forward <,> for the obstruction <,> and so Salim
Javed will take this free kick <,,> for <,,> Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#71:1:B>
A wasted free kick <,> mis directed <,> Bidhan Nagar also now
playing study football just long clearances <,,> in <,,> inter space <,,>
just trying to wind time away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#72:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#73:1:B>
Komal Ghosh being the scorer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#74:1:B>
Raja Chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get <,,> Komal Ghosh
in action but it is the right back Amit Singh Rawat <,> who intercepts and
place the ball into touch <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#75:1:B>
Yet another throwing <,> for Bidhan Nagar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#76:1:B>
Referee Joji looking <,> at his watch <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#77:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition <,,> good
build up this <,,> but well foiled by Surendar Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#78:1:B>
From the far side it is Imad Hussein building up an attack <,,> for
Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#79:1:B>
The typical <,,> long <,,> pass but very well headed away <,,> by
Bidhan Nagar Parmanand Karmakar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#80:1:B>
The long ball tactics of Sports College Lucknow not <,,> really <,>
penetrating enough <,,> to <,,> upset the tight marking <,,> and <,,> Bidhan
Nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air <,> and <,> on the
ground <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#81:1:B>
Habib and Mondal now it could give <}> <-> <.> Neg </.> </-> <=>
Niyogi </=> </}> <,> in the striker position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#82:1:B>
He steals a diagonal but <,> displayed by Shailendra Kumar the poor
Shailendra Kumar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#83:1:B>
And it is Lalit Rathod <,,> give the ball to Veer Bahadur Thapa
<,,> dangerous striker <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#84:1:B>
Good ball controlled by Veer Bahadur Thapa <,,> <O> one word </O>
<,,> takes the return pass <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#85:1:B>
<w> It's </w> the Rajan Kumar <,,> moving up <,,> but again
misdirected by <O> one word </O> Bidhan Nagar defender <,,> Shankar Das to
make a long aimless clearance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#86:1:B>
This tactics could misfire because on a break away Sports College
Lucknow could equalise <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#87:1:B>
It would be very demoralising for Bidhan Nagar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#88:1:B>
In the beginning they stop playing <,> constructive football the
type of football they are capable of playing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#89:1:B>
And <,,> that is formed by Sujeet Niyogi <,,> strike and you will
see yet another substitution

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#90:1:B>
<w> It's </w> number seventeen Sudeep Majumdar <,> who is coming on
for Bidhan Nagar so they have <,> used first <O> one word </O> <,> on team
substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want
according to latest <?> SEFA </?> rule <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#91:1:B>
And coming out is the number eight <,> for Bidhan Nagar <,,> is
<,,> that is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#92:1:B>
And a down step Sports College Lucknow but number twelve <,,> Salim
Javed shoot wide <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#93:1:B>
So Sudeep Majumdar on the field the substitute <,,> to Komal Das
Komal Ghosh <,> from the left side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#94:1:B>
Komal Ghosh dribbles well and good ball control

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#95:1:B>
Komal Ghosh <,> gives the fine smooth pass but it deflects <,> for
Sports College Lucknow defender <,,> and <,,> good <,,> recovery tackle <,,>
by their <O> one word </O> back Surendra Kumar <,,> which prevents danger
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#96:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar <,> in attack <,,> but <,,> <w> it's </w> infringement
and so Sports College <,> Lucknow will get this free kick if they take from
the near right long clearance from Amit Singh Rawat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#97:1:B>
The ball with Salim Javed <,,> now with Shailendra Kumar <,> with
Manoj Singh <,,> long clearance to Imdad Hussein <,> attempted long pass but
which is misdirected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#98:1:B>
So Bidhan Nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players
and <,,> three forwards <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#99:1:B>
And leading Sports College Lucknow <,> by one goal to nil

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#100:1:B>
Sports College Lucknow playing in the traditional four to four
formation

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#101:1:B>
Four defenders two mid field players <,> and four forward <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#102:1:B>
Though one of their wingers just <,> frequently fall back <,> to
help the forward line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#103:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar so far quite untroubled <,> by Sports College Lucknow
<w> it's </w> long passing game <,> and <,,> they can hold out unnecessary
defence in <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#104:1:B>
Long pass trying to get Veer Bahadur Thapa <,> in action <,,> but
the ball is too long to wangled for Veer Bahadur <,,> to even get <,> near to
it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#105:1:B>
Veer Bahadur Thapa of course <,,> is the prolofic dangerous
striker for Sports College Lucknow but he has not received the service <,> to
which he can do justice <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#106:1:B>
Shankar Das getting ready with a long free kick <,,> goal kick
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#107:1:B>
But doesn't find an opponent Komal Ghosh going up for the ball
losing out to stretched out Komal Ghosh <,,> Sports College Lucknow taller
fitter but <,> making a tight control with the Bidhan Nagar players there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#108:1:B>
Now <w> it's </w> a good throw pass to Komal Ghosh <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#109:1:B>
But it accidently handles the ball and <w> there's </w> a free
kick <,> to Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#110:1:B>
Misdirected free kick Raja Chatterjee edge <,> but it <?> heller
</?> goes straight to Lalit Rathod <,> Lalit Rathod to Veer Bahadur Thapa
<,,> who attempts the cross from the right <,> but he doesn't reach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#111:1:B>
So one of the rare break away move <,> Sports College Lucknow
couldn't really spell any danger <,> couldn't create any major danger <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#112:1:B>
One more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find Komal Ghosh
<,,> but he is unable to attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#113:1:B>
So one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football
<,> and there will be a throwing <,> being taken by Amit Singh Rawat <,> the
right back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#114:1:B>
Amit Singh Rawat <,> right back <,,> trying to find Lalit Singh
<,,> who turns and shoot but promptly cleared by <,> Parmanand Karmakar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#115:1:B>
Amit Singh Rawat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#116:1:B>
Now it is Raja Chatterjee pulled up for pushing <,,> Salim Javed
from behind and so <w> it's </w> a foul <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#117:1:B>
Free kick <,,> which is being taken by Lalit Singh of Sports
College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#118:1:B>
Free kick from the near right <,,> if taken accurately could
create danger

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#119:1:B>
Three Sports College Lucknow <,> player up in the box <,,> but
well cleared by Shankar Das <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#120:1:B>
A chance here for Sports College Lucknow Veer Bahadur Thapa has
the ball <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#121:1:B>
And now <,> good shot by Imdad <,> a good shot by Imad Imdad
Hussein <,> but which went wide <,> gives the side <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#122:1:B>
So this was the danger because what could happen <,,> Bidhan Nagar
by being such a defensive <,,> and trying to lose out the ball <,> and <,,>
on a break away move Sports College Lucknow nearly collide <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#123:1:B>
Now it is <,,> Manoj Singh on the far side <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#124:1:B>
But an aimless clearance by Manoj <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#125:1:B>
Arbind Mhatra <,> sending it to skipper Sanjoy Das <,,> who kicks
it on <,,> to Deepak Mandol <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#126:1:B>
Deepak Mandol controls <w> it's </w> a long clearance <,> a chance
now by Sujeet Niyogi <,> top of the box <,,> but the ball goes to the goal
keeper <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#127:1:B>
Bidhan Nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing
minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#128:1:B>
Probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a
little time <,> by taking these long rangers

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#129:1:B>
They also hope to unsettle <,> goal keeper Abdus Salam <,> and try
for a rebound

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#130:1:B>
Komal Ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here
<,,> on the left <,> but it is Amit Singh Rawat who gets there first and
clear the ball into touch <,> for a throwing <,> to Bidhan Nagar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#131:1:B>
So these seems to be the tactic for Bidhan Nagar long passes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#132:1:B>
And now it is again Komal Ghosh but <,> uh obstruction by the two
Bidhan Nagar players Amit Singh Rawat and throw foul <,> which will be taken
by Amit Singh Rawat at right flank <,> for Sports College Lucknow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#133:1:B>
Goaler <,,> goaler <,> in yellow shirts Sports College Lucknow
<,,> not <,> being able to create any cohesive attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#134:1:B>
Now Bidhan Nagar developing an attack to Sujeet Niyogi <,> Sujeet
Niyogi a fine through pass from far right <,> and on the far right it is
Deepak Mandol getting control yes <,> he dribbles <,> but he is <,,> very
crudely tackled <,> and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire
Joji could have given <,> advantage because he had managed Deepak Mandol had
managed to dribble <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#135:1:B>
Again Chander Joshi <,,> and the free kick now <,> to <,> Bidhan
Nagar from the far right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#136:1:B>
A free kick <,,> uh Sports College Lucknow <,,> building up an
attack <,,> from the near side it is to Rajan Kumar <,> Rajan Kumar loses out
the ball <,,> to Lalit Rathod Lalit Rathod in centre of the field <,,>
building up an attack with Lalit Singh back to Lalit Rathod <,,> a diagonal
pass to the near right to Veer Bahadur Thapa <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#137:1:B>
This could be dangerous Veer Bahadur Thapa moving up picking up
pace <,> dribble pass one <,> against the form but he gets a free kick just
outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty
and could have spell danger <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#138:1:B>
Again the break away move causing danger to Bidhan Nagar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#139:1:B>
Veer Bahadur Thapa certainly shows <,> good subtle pulse and quick
control <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#140:1:B>
The most dangerous movement <,> for <,> Sports College Lucknow
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#141:1:B>
Veer Bahadur Thapa <,> picked himself up his credit being thinking
of himself <,,> uh a wall being formed ten yards away <,> this is an area
with certainly a well directed free kick <,> could lead to a goal

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#142:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a direct free kick Veer Bahadur Thapa is there <,>
Rajan Kumar is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#143:1:B>
<w> Let's </w> see how Sports College Lucknow take this free kick
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#144:1:B>
Veer Bahadur Thapa props up <,> and this could be a goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-003#145:1:B>
Rajan Kumar kicks in the rebound <,,> as goal keeper Vimal Das
