<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#1:1:A>
So when did you come <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#2:1:B>
I came today morning at seven <w> O'clock </w> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#3:1:B>
And I reached here <,> I came by <indig> Dakshin </indig> Express
from Delhi

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#4:1:B>
First from Amritsar I took <,,> a train and I came by AC fare <,,>
and from there I have to take another train which is this <indig> Dakshin
</indig> Express <,,> and <,,> uh I took second AC there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#5:1:B>
And I don't know how <w> they're </w> going to pay me now <,> <O>
laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#6:1:A>
There is more than the first class <O> laughs </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#7:1:C>
<w> It's </w> a pleasant experience <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#8:1:B>
It was a pleasant experience but also very tiring

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#9:1:B>
This train is <,,> uh it takes thirty-six hours <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#10:1:B>
And there is a faster train <,> Andhra Express which takes just
twenty-four hours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#11:1:B>
But the timing doesn't suit

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#12:1:A>
Uhm how things are moving in Punjab now-a-days <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#13:1:B>
Punjab is much better now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#14:1:B>
And <,> as you must have read in the papers <,> as they say <,>
eighty percent of the problem is solved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#15:1:B>
It is really solved because <,,> one can lead a normal life now <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#16:1:A>
But twenty percent problem is there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#17:1:B>
Twenty percent means that you don't feel it

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#18:1:B>
You see <,> I mean crime is always there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#19:1:B>
So you can say <,> some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be
there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#20:1:B>
But for <,> uh for practical purposes <,> I mean when the life was
disturbed <,> that thing was not there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#21:1:A>
What do you think about this Ayodhya problem now <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#22:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> a bad thing <,> whatever has happened
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#23:1:B>
And <,> uh <,,> I think the <,> educated <,> Hindu people <,> <}>
<-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> also think

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#24:1:B>
The silent majority thinks <,> that <w> it's </w> a wrong thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#25:1:B>
I mean this is exactly what happened in Punjab you know <,,> when
<{> <[> the Akalis </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#26:1:A>
<[> Do <w> Punjabi's </w> </[> </{> think is <,> <w> it's </w>
uh something wrong

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#27:1:C>
Yeah will they be in favour of BJP <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#28:1:B>
No they think <w> it's </w> wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#29:1:B>
Because <,> a similar thing happened <,> with the Akalis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#30:1:B>
Uh they started listening to people who were not within the party
<,> like that Bindrawala or <,> uh modern things that worsened the terrorists
or whatever

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#31:1:B>
So now <}> <-> BGP </-> <=> BJP </=> </}> has taken orders from uh
<,> <{> <[> <indig> sadhus </indig> and <indig> sanyasis </indig> <,,> uhm
yes

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#32:1:B>
So they don't face the same problem <,> what I feel that it could
turn out to be that way <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#33:1:C>
<[> <indig> Sadhus </indig> and <indig> sanyasis </indig> </[>
</{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#34:1:A>
Oh so it may <,,> turn out like a boomrang

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#35:1:B>
Yes <,> it I think it will be like that <,,> because you see
<,,> uh people <,> majority as I said <,> majority of the people they are
aware of all this now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#36:1:B>
Even the <,> uneducated people many of them <,> they want to live
in peace <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#37:1:B>
And all this disturbs peace <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#38:1:A>
Some <,> people feel that there is a kind of new awareness <,>
and because of <,> that <,> BJP is likely to <,,> be benefitted

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#39:1:B>
<w> There's </w> no awareness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#40:1:B>
These are all political stunts I think <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#41:1:C>
Oh well are you happy here <,,> Satyam ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#42:1:B>
<w> It's </w> too early to say that but so far <w> it's </w>
fine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#43:1:B>
And <,> uh <w> I've </w> to be careful of the mosquitoes here <O>
laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#44:1:B>
And uh I think it should be fine and <,> I had long desired to come
here because <,,> uh it is the what you say Mecca for <,,> uh <{> <[> English
</[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#45:1:C>
<[> English </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#46:1:A>
You you don't have mosquitoes there in your home <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#47:1:B>
No <,,> we have mosquitoes there

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#48:1:B>
But <,> mosquitoes of CIEFL are famous <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#49:1:C>
I mean that what you told <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#50:1:A>
Uh you see the mosquitoes are there <,> mosquito curtains are
not there and uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#51:1:B>
No you see we <,> in Amritsar <,> <w> there's </w> <w> it's
</w> an extreme weather <,> <{> <[> ah ha <,> I mean <w> it's </w> very cold
there now <,> and it will be hotter than what is here now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#52:1:B>
So when <w> it's </w> severe cold mosquitoes will die out and <,>
severe <.> wint </.> uh <,,> summers <{> <[> <w> they'll </w> again </[> die

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#53:1:A>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#54:1:A>
<[> Mosquitoes are there </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#55:1:B>
Uhm so they are only some <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#56:1:C>
So you are free from mosquitoes <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#57:1:B>
Not throughout the year <,> but <,> of course <,> and here you
see the mosquitoes are well bred <O> laughs </O> <,> uhm yes so there they
die <,> and then again they have to <,> come up

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#58:1:C>
And then they attack <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#59:1:B>
But <,> I don't know why they can't control it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#60:1:B>
I mean in uh <,> when <w> I'm </w> uh during the mosquito season in
like Amritsar and many cities <,> especially in uh <,> <w> let's </w> say
some good colonies <,> the municipalities they spray <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#61:1:B>
So if the muncipality of Hyderabad

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#62:1:A>
So what would be the reason then <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#63:1:B>
I think <,> uh there should be a spray in the campus <,> the
mosquitoes

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#64:1:B>
We won't have them in the campus

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#65:1:A>
Simple reason is <,> if you want to control you can control if
you don't <O> laughter </O> <,> and

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#66:1:B>
So <,> if CIEFL is doing such good work in languages <,> <{>
<[> ah <,> it should do this little work of killing mosquitoes also <O>
laughs </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#67:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#68:1:A>
So after <,,> uh hearing so much about <,> uh CIEFL <{1> <[1>
uhm <,> and coming over here <{2> <[2> uhm <,> uh what exactly <,> you want
to do <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#69:1:B>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#70:1:B>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#71:1:B>
See actually I came here <,> of course

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#72:1:C>
For refresher course <w> that's </w> all right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#73:1:A>
To get refreshed <O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#74:1:B>
And uh a friend of mine says <,> uh the <,> Hyderabad is
famous for pearls <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#75:1:B>
He has given me some money to buy some <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#76:1:B>
So <w> I've </w> up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls
are because I don't know what they are <,> <{1> <[1> <indig> haan </indig>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#77:1:B>
And there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#78:1:B>
So I will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine <,> and uh
<,> I will visit uh <w> there's </w> a museum they say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#79:1:A>
<[1> <indig> Haan </indig> </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#80:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#81:1:C>
Uh Salarjung

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#82:1:B>
And uh a fort <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#83:1:C>
<w> That's </w> why I wanted five days a week <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#84:1:C>
And I also told Dr Prakasham <,> to arrange something for atleast
people from outside

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#85:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#86:1:B>
I mean <w> you're </w> you are an outsider

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#87:1:C>
Yes yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#88:1:C>
Though of course you must have seen everything because you have
been staying here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#89:1:C>
But still there are many <,> could be many people who haven't <,,>
or a few of them so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#90:1:A>
They have made the programme very tight <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#91:1:B>
<w> It's </w> very correct <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#92:1:C>
And they treat us as <,> uh school children <O> laughter </O>
<,> because they don't allow <,> or they dont give any time to <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#93:1:B>
They they can have the same number of sessions same number of
speakers <,> and uh with <,> uh one lecture say <,> if <w> it's </w> one and
half hours <,> make it one hour <,,> and with teacher there also he just
keeps

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#94:1:A>
Would you would you like to come out with <,> uh your idea <,>
when we find something is <.> impo </.> imposed from <,,> above

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#95:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#96:1:A>
Then people accept it as it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#97:1:A>
And <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#98:1:B>
Uh yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#99:1:A>
They don't want

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#100:1:B>
They say the UGC says so many working hours

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#101:1:A>
Uhm sometimes the UGC says <,> and we find <,> uh what goes
in political circle

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#102:1:C>
So I think what ever you think in academic also <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#103:1:B>
I think what they should do is <,> they should make it from
<,> <w> let's </w> say five-thirty to six-thirty everyday <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#104:1:B>
One hour is added there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#105:1:B>
Cut off Saturday <,> and adding one hour means missing one hour
<,> because <O> laughter </O> ) when the programme is too long <,> you will
naturally cut it short

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#106:1:A>
No in Maharashtra what they say <,> that there is <indig>
adeshraj </indig> <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and as <,> when something comes from
above <,> it could not be challenged <,> whether it is rational or irrational
<,> accept it and act upon it <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#107:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#108:1:B>
Uhm see <w> that's </w> on paper you see <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#109:1:A>
No that <O> laughter </O> <{> <[> so </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#110:1:B>
<[> so </[> </{> little

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#111:1:C>
I requested them why not to <,> turn some of the sessions
into library sessions

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#112:1:B>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#113:1:C>
And then all of us could have got benefitted

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#114:1:B>
What is this project <,> that they are talking about <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#115:1:C>
You can have any project <,,> <{> <[> ah <,> of your choice

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#116:1:B>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#117:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#118:1:C>
If <,> project means we can you have to say have particular
topic

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#119:1:C>
You have to work on that topic <,> and this is the way the thing
could be done dealt <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#120:1:C>
This is what you have to <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#121:1:B>
<indig> Achha </indig> so you just uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#122:1:A>
You know synopsis of the project

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#123:1:B>
What is it ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#124:1:C>
No they don't give

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#125:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#126:1:A>
They don't give you have to have a <,> data

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#127:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#128:1:A>
For uh <,> yes if you have a problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#129:1:B>
Uhm uhm and then you work on that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#130:1:A>
Then you work on that either in the library or <,> field or
whatever <,> it maybe

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#131:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> just like writing of the paper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#132:1:A>
<w> That's </w> all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#133:1:B>
<w> That's </w> all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#134:1:B>
Suppose I want to <,> work on two novels <,> will it do <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#135:1:A>
Oh yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#136:1:A>
Why two ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#137:1:B>
One one one yes that is <indig> nei </indig> <,> but thay are
also saying that you have to present a paper at the end

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#138:1:A>
That is the same work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#139:1:A>
When you work on a particular <,> say a

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#140:1:B>
<indig> Nei nei </indig> they were talking about two
different things <,> that everybody has to speak for about ten minutes <,> on
something <,> and then several others

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#141:1:A>
<indig> Nei </indig> once you have a project <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#142:1:B>
Uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#143:1:A>
Definitely <w> you've </w> to present a paper <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#144:1:B>
<indig> Nei </indig> but <w> that's </w> compulsory for all ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#145:1:C>
No that ten minutes business is compulsory

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#146:1:A>
<w> It's </w> that is compulsory <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#147:1:B>
So that again a paper and project is again a paper <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#148:1:A>
No both in all you have

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#149:1:C>
Faster than <O> One or two words </O> that will be for every
body

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#150:1:B>
That is for everybody right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#151:1:B>
And the project <,> the problem that you work on <,> you have to
present that also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#152:1:A>
You have half an hour choice

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#153:1:B>
Half an hour

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#154:1:C>
And then discussion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#155:1:B>
Discussion is also going to be about cross question and all
what we have so <,> I think the four speaker is going to be just this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#156:1:A>
That is a just <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#157:1:B>
Uh first ten minutes talk <,> and then half an hour talks <,>
by the participants <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#158:1:A>
See for pretty long time that practice teaching <,> sessions
are there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#159:1:A>
And still we find they are not ready to come out of that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#160:1:A>
So here also <w> it's </w> a kind of practice teaching <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#161:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#162:1:A>
And as we find <,,> these things are not there <,> we are
there <O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#163:1:B>
It is uh it is going to be you you are going to have B Ed
teaching

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-013#164:1:A>
No, not I <,> but see <,> paper reading comes to that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-013#165:1:A>
Actually see <,> in uh <,> one months time is it possible for you
to present a really something that can be called the research paper <,,> ?

<$B>
