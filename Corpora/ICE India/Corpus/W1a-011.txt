<ICE-IND:W1A-011#3:1>
And on the other side she is getting rude type of behaviour from
everyone.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#4:1>
Due to the invasions of the many invaders protection of the woman was
in <del> necessary </del> danger.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#65:3>
1) If the person is <}> <-> socialy </-> <+> socially </+> </}>
hated or refused by many persons like friends, parents & etc., then he
develops <}> <-> infiriority </-> <+> inferiority </+> </}> complex in him
and it <}> <-> led </-> <+> leads </+> </}> to maladjustment.

capability of <}> <-> there </-> <+> their </+> </}> children and loads <->
them </-> heavy goals on them which are <del> not </del> out of <}> <-> there

elders <del> between thers </del> of what they say & <}> <-> what </-> <+>
how </+> </}> they act.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#71:3>
They <-> tell </-> say something and act on some thing <+> else </+> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#72:3>
So person cannot take the proper value.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#73:3>
And this leads to maladjustment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#74:3>
5) Many parents <}> <-> thing </-> <+> think </+> </}> that their
<del> child </del> <}> <-> children's </-> <+> children </+> </}> are
extraordinary and different from every body else but <-> since </-> this is

They become very rude sometimes or soft <+> at </+> times.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#81:3>
This leads to maladjustments.

where </-> <+> what </+> </}> parents sa<del>n</del>y then father becomes
extra <del> so </del> hard & mother becomes extra soft.

<I> <O> Q.3 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#85:4>
India is vast <}> <-> country </-> <=> country </=> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#86:4>
It is like continent <del> in </del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#87:4>
India is surrounded by huge mountains in north & by sea water in

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#89:4>
So because of this it is said that India has preserved its unity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#90:4>
India is <+> a </+> vast country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#91:4>
It has many peoples who speak<del>s</del> many different languages,

They are <del> into the </del> so involved in India that they do not
<}> <-> thing </-> <+> think </+> </}> they are <del> par </del> not part of
this country, religion, caste & etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#94:4>
<w> This's <w> because people of India do not hate them but love them
& appreciate what they have.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#95:4>
<del> Our unity </del> They are so much involved in India that they
also follow caste system & many other things of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#96:4>
People are also united because of religious ideas by many of the
hol<del>g</del>y book like <mention> Gita, Koran, <}> <-> Bibble </-> <+>
Bible </+> </}> </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#97:4>
They follow the ideas & values of <}> <-> that </-> <+> these </+>
</}> books.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#98:4>
They are also united because in India there are ma<del>y</del>ny such

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#101:4>
They are also united because of war also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#102:4>
There were many <}> <-> attact </-> <+> attacks </+> </}> <del> on

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#103:4>
They have fought against all such odd unitedly & won much of them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#104:4>
They do not <}> <-> thing </-> <+> think </+> </}> that <del> they
</del> these persons are not from community so we should not save because
when calamities will come on them <}> <-> than </-> <+> then </+> </}> these
are only the people to save them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#105:4>
But due to <}> <-> unsocial </-> <+> anti-social </+> </}> <}> <->
factors </-> <+> elements </+> </}> like smugglers, political leaders there
brings tensions in the country but these did <del> bring </del> not cause any

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#106:4>
So it is said that <del> in </del> <quote> ` Indian society exhibits
unity in diversity' </quote> . </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.7 a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#107:5>
Causes of unemployment of the people in India are as follows:

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#108:5>
1) Many Industries or <}> <-> agriculture </-> <+> agricultural </+>
</}> activities take place in some seasons only like surgarcane factory,
cultivation of crops & etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#109:5>
So much, of the period of the<del>e</del> year people are
unemployed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#110:5>
2) High birth rate is also responsible for unemployment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#111:5>
<del> India has is birth is growing 2.5 perspop </del> In India
there is addition of 2.5 % of population every year.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#112:5>
But the economic development is not much rapid as compared to
population.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#113:5>
So that people can get employment. <&> incomplete sentence </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#114:5>
3) Many people are so poor that they cannot get there all <w> day's
</w> necessities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#115:5>
So <del> Ho </del> how could they <}> <-> offer </-> <+> afford </+>
</}> to spend <del> t </del> money <}> <-> of </-> <+> on </+> </}> the
education of <del> chi </del> <}> <-> there </-> <+> their </+> </}>
children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#116:5>
So <del> if </del> <w> that's </w> why when people do not have
employment because of <del> educon </del> education. <&> incomplete sentence
</&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#117:5>
4) <del> O </del> In our India education is not job-oriented.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#118:5>
It is only general education.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#119:5>
5) Many Industries were started by the Britishers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#120:5>
And many skilled handicrafts because of that became unemployed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#121:5>
6) In India there is not fast <}> <-> Industriallasation </-> <+>
industrialisation </+> </}> taking place.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#122:5>
So that there cannot be employment <}> <-> opportunity. </-> <+>
opportunities. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#123:5>
7) New <}> <-> tecknolo<del>ad</del>gy </-> <+> technology </+> </}>
<}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+> </}> introduced of new <del> wl </del> instead
of old one.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#124:5>
A<del>el</del> nd this requires only less <}> <-> amt </-> <+>
amount </+> </}> of people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#125:5>
So there is no employment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#126:5>
8) Economic development of our country is not progressing as well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#127:5>
So there are <del> not </del> no <del> emplo </del> more employment

<h> Conservation of renewable of reso<del>n</del>urces in India:-
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#129:6>
Renewable resources are those resources which are in ample
quantity and which does not get <}> <-> extinguish. </-> <+> exhausted </+>
</}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#130:6>
They can <del> not </del> be produced <}> <-> eithery </-> <+>
either </+> </}> by the human beings or by the na<del>r</del>ture.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#131:6>
<del> Bot </del> But we must conserve <}> <-> this </-> <+> these
</+> </}> resources <del> we </del> very well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#132:6>
Because the resources are interlinked between themselves.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#133:6>
Any faulty action towards them will cause serious effect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#134:6>
And by conservation we do not mean do not use the resources but we
must use it properly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#135:6>
Th<del>i</del>ese <-> is </-> interlinked can be explained as
follows.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#136:6>
If we consume our forest, in wrong direction <del> and </del> or we
<del> co </del> go on cutting the plants without any consciousness do
deforestation in anyway.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#137:6>
Then it can <}> <-> effect </-> <+> affect </+> </}> many other
resources.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#138:6>
Plants provide<del>s</del> firmness to the soil.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#139:6>
<del> It </del> Soil particles are <del> at </del> attached because
of the plants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#140:6>
But if plants are cut away then they cannot hold soil particles &
soil particles are washed away by air or rain.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#141:6>
Many of the deserts are man-made.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#142:6>
<del> P </del> We will not get the machine to take out our required
water from the deepest of the earth.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#143:6>
Because <del> plan </del> roots of plants <del> suck </del> absorb
water from the earth & give it to the air by leaves.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#144:6>
And this fall into rains.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#145:6>
And if we cut it will be affected.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#146:6>
Forests <+> provide </+> protection to animals & humans

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#147:6>
And give valuable food to these.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#148:6>
But if we do deforestation we will not get it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#149:6>
If we spoil the air then it will be affected to us only.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#150:6>
Then we will get numerous <}> <-> disease </-> <+> diseases </+>
</}> so we must try to conserve our resources in right way and when they are
demanded.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#151:6>
But not in faulty way <del> as ti </del> as it causes many problems.

<I> <O> Q6) a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#152:7>
The different types of <del> o </del> conflicts causing stress are
as follows :

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#153:7>
<h> Approach - - Approach Conflict : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#154:7>
In this there are two goals which are of the same level and
which are positive and desirable.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#155:7>
Person can take any one of them because they are <del> as </del> of
equal importance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#156:7>
If <+> a </+> person chooses one goal <}> <-> than </-> <+> then
</+> </}> he cannot choose another goal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#157:7>
He <del> h </del> would have to depart it or cannot take it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#158:7>
This causes mental stress as to choose which of the goals as they
are of equal importance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#159:7>
So person should calmly think over it <+> then </+> take the right
<}> <-> decission </-> <+> decision </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#160:7>
Eg : - <del> Pe </del> Student cannot take <del> in </del>
simultaneously B.Sc, B.Com, B.A or any other courses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#161:7>
2) <h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#162:7>
Approach - Avoidance conflict : - </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#163:7>
In this there is only one goal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#164:7>
It is favourable, as well as it is <}> <-> unfouerable </-> <+>
unfavourable </+> </}> , it is desirable as well as undesirable, it is
positive as well as negative.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#165:7>
<del> So e.g. </del> As there is no other goals student has to take
onother <del> it </del> or apart from it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#166:7>
And live in that manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#167:7>
eg:- Student wants to join <del> military </del> Air force <}>
<-> But </-> <+> but </+> </}> he is afraid because of <del> o </del>
uncertainties of life & death in that. </p> <h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#168:7>
Avoidance - Avoidance conflict : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#169:7>
In this there are two goals.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#170:7>
These both goals are <del> dos </del> undesi<del>n</del>rable,
unfavourable, and negative.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#171:7>
Persons generally do not like them & run away from <}> <-> this </->
<+> these </+> </}> goals.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#172:7>
But he must not runaway from <}> <-> this </-> <+> these </+> </}>
goals <+> , </+> he should select <}> <-> that </-> <+> those </+> </}> goals
which <}> <-> is </-> <+> are </+> </}> less <del> posi </del> negative, less
unfavourable, less undesirable than others. </p> <h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#173:7>
Double - Approach - Avoidance Conflict : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-011#174:7>
In this also there are two goals.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#175:7>
But they are not of the same level.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#176:7>
Some might be less positive, some might be less negative & etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#177:7>
These goals <}> <-> has </-> <+> have </+> </}> some advantages &
some disadvantages.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#178:7>
Person has to think over it when selecting goal of this kind.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#179:7>
<del> Th </del> When they take one goal they must think over
advantage & disadvantage of other goals also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-011#180:7>
eg:- Person has to make up the choice whe<del>n</del>ther to join
Private Sector <del> & </del> or Public Sector. </p> </I>
