A whole year had passed since he died.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#7:1>
Yet I found myself expecting to see his face when I looked up or hear
his laughter behind me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#8:1>
But there was nothing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#9:1>
Just the tranquillity of the cemetry and the coolness of the evening.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#10:1>
I glanced at my watch.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#11:1>
It was half past four -- I didn't have to pick up my brother till
after six.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#12:1>
Carefully smoothing my skirt, I sat down on the dry ground and allowed
the tears to roll down my cheeks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#13:1>
It still hurt.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#14:1>
Even after so long, it still hurt. </p> <*>

<quote> " <w> I've </w> never said no, have I?"</quote>

<quote> " <w> What's </w> your paper on?" </quote> </p>

<p>

With <w> Shannon's </w> paper neatly sealed in an envelope, I slipped

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#49:1>
Suddenly, the phone rang.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#50:1>
I groaned before reaching to answer it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#51:1>
<quote> " Hello?" </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#52:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#53:1>
" Mrs. Kadison?

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#54:1>
<w> What's </w> wrong?" </p>

Panic shook me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#58:1>
<quote> " The cancer?"</quote> I asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#59:1>
<quote> " They say he might not make it.

<w> He's </w> conscious now - - he wanted me to call you." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#61:1>
I checked the time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#62:1>
It was after midnight.

<quote> " <w> I'll </w> be right there." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#64:1>
Shannon was asleep when I reached his room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#65:1>
His usually tanned skin was pale and several tubes ran across the
length of his arms.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#66:1>
It hurt to look at him. I reached out to brush a strand of
chocolate-coloured hair away from his face.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#67:1>
He opened his eyes and smiled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#68:1>
<quote> " Hey, best friend," </quote> he greeted me,softly. </p>

<p> <quote> " Hey, you too." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#69:1>
He moved his arm slightly and winced.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#70:1>
<quote> " How do I look?" </quote> he asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#71:1>
I smiled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#72:1>
<quote> " Pretty bad." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#73:1>
<quote> " <w> You've </w> got such a wonderful bedside manner."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#74:1>
<quote> " <w> How're </w> you feeling?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#75:1>
He took several deep breaths before replying.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#76:1>
<quote> " Okay, I guess.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#77:1>
They want to do a bone marrow transplant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#78:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#79:1>
<quote> " What about the chemo?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#80:1>
<quote> " They said that all that <w> it's </w> doing is making

of air.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#81:1>
<quote> " My hair is starting to fall." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#82:1>
He wrinkled his nose in disgust. </p> +

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#83:1>
I laughed.

<quote> " Your mom said you fainted at your <w> girlfriend's </w>

<p>

<quote> " Yeah.

I rolled the wheelchair with Shannon sitting uncomfortably in it,
down the hospital ramp, towards my car. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#94:1>
<quote> " I hate this thing," </quote> Shannon complained, and
jumped out of the seat as soon as we got to the car.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#95:1>
<quote> " Can I drive?" </quote> he asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#96:1>
I looked over at the nurse, who had walked with us, and waited
for her reply.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#97:1>
She smiled pleasantly and nodded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#98:1>
<quote> " Just don't go too fast," </quote> she warned, and handed
me a sheet of paper to sign.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#99:1>
<quote> " Thanks," </quote> she said, before waving to Shannon and
heading back into the hospital, taking the wheelchair with her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#100:1>
Shannon had crawled into the <w> driver's </w> seat and turned
on the ignition.

<quote> " Come on, Shan, <w> let's </w> hit the beach before the sun
sets." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#102:1>
I climbed in and leaned against the leather seat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#103:1>
Shannon had been discharged a week before the transplant so he could
spend some time out of hospital before having to go back to spend nearly
three weeks there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#104:1>
After having been kept indoors for six days, Shannon was craving for
the bright sunshine of California and his favourite spot, the private beach
he had inherited from his grandfather.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#105:1>
Shannon and I had spent a lot of time there, watching the sun set in
the evenings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#106:1>
<quote> " What are you thinking about?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#107:1>
Shannon asked me, turning off at the corner and heading down to the
beach. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#108:1>
I shook my head.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#109:1>
<quote> " Nothing." </quote> <O> drawing </O> + I look over at him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#110:1>
<quote> " How are you feeling?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#111:1>
<quote> " Oh come on, Shan, don't fret.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#112:1>
I feel absolutely fine ! Loosen up," </quote> he cried.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#113:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> a beautiful day and <w> we're </w> going to
watch a beautiful sunset.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#114:1>
Then <w> I'll </w> pick up Kristine and go dancing at the country

<p>

<quote> " Sure <w> you're </w> ready for it?"</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#116:1>
Shannon pulled into the parking lot at the beach and turned to
me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#117:1>
<quote> " Shannon, <w> I'm </w> really okay," </quote> he said
seriously.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#118:1>
<quote> " If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#119:1>
<quote> " Sure you would." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#120:1>
I got out of the car and followed him towards his part of the beach
that lay hidden behind large rocks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#121:1>
The beach was pretty much deserted as it usually was at this time.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#122:1>
The two of us sat down on the moist sand, a few feet apart,
watching in silence as the sun began its usual descent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#123:1>
The sky was painted in bright oranges and soft reds, the sea
reflecting the colours - - changing from its deep-blue to a shade of amber.

So many <O> <&> page </&> 114 </O> <O> <*> black square </*>

Shannon lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#127:1>
He was paler than ever and there were more tubes in him than I had
ever seen.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#128:1>
He looked so vulnerable that I wanted to get him out of there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#129:1>
He was staring noncommittally at the ceiling when I sat down
beside the bed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#130:1>

<quote> " We live," </quote> I replied. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#183:1>
Shannon smiled and took my hand, holding it tightly in his.

<quote> " How long have we been friends?" </quote> Shannon asked
me, one day. </p>

<p>

<quote> " Sixteen years." </quote> </p>

<quote> " How come we never dated?" </quote> </p>

<p>

I smiled.

<quote> " You never asked." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#190:1>
He seemed to think about that for a moment.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#191:1>
<quote> " Would you have said yes?" </quote> </p>

<p>

Shannon said to me and I found myself wheeling him to my car, this time
without any complaints from him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#195:1>
He could barely walk and he was a sick shade of grey.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#196:1>
He couldn't even smile anymore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#197:1>
I drove to the beach, parking as close+ the sand as possible.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#198:1>
Pulling out the wheelchair, I helped Shannon into it and began to
push him down the beach.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#199:1>
Since it would be impossible to manoeuvre the wheelchair across the
rocks, we settled in a secluded spot just nearby. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#200:1>
<quote> " You okay?" </quote> I asked him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#201:1>
Shannon nodded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#202:1>
I held his hand as he got out of the chair and we carefully sat
down on the dry sand, close to the sea.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#203:1>
At times, the cold water would gently caress our bare feet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#204:1>
<quote> " Why do you put up with me?" </quote> Shannon asked
suddenly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#205:1>
<quote> " What kind of a question is that?"</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#206:1>
<quote> " <w> We're </w> best friends, right?"</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#207:1>
I looked at him curiously.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#208:1>
<quote> " You know the answer to that one." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#209:1>
<quote> " Can friends love each other?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#210:1>
I considered his question.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#211:1>
<quote> " I think so. Love doesn't have to be restricted." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#212:1>
Very slowly, Shannon leaned over to me and gently kissed me, his
fingers tenderly brushing my cheek.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#213:1>
<quote> " We would have made a great couple, Shannon," </quote> he
whispered when we drew apart.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#214:1>
<quote> " I love you, best friend." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#215:1>
In those words were <quote> " <w> I'm </w> sorry for all the
trouble <w> I've </w> been" </quote> and <quote> " Thank you for always being
there" </quote> and <quote> " I wish we had more time together" </quote> and
<quote> " You are my best friend." </p> </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#216:1>
I shifted slightly so that Shannon was now leaning against me,
his head on my shoulder.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#217:1>
I wrapped my arms tightly around his frail body, trying to give him
some of my strength.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#218:1>
But, as the sun once again vanished into the ocean, and the sky
transformed into the velvet carpet of deep blue - - he was gone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#219:1>
It had been our final sunset together. </p> <*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#220:1>
The raindrops on my skin brought me out of my reverie and I
quickly stood up, brushing the dirt off my skirt.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#221:1>
I wiped the last traces of tears from my cheeks. </p> 

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#222:1>
The sun was hidden behind the dark clouds that had formed and
the sweet smell of rain lingered in the air.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#223:1>
Suddenly, a thought struck me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#224:1>
I bent down and picked up the white rose from the ground. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#225:1>
The sand underneath my bare feet was wet and cool.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#226:1>
Raising my arm, I flung the single flower into the water.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#227:1>
The waves quickly swallowed the rose and it disappeared from my
view. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-009#228:1>
At that moment, I could see <w> Shannon's </w> face in front of
me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#229:1>
I could hear his laughter in my ears and feel his touch against my
skin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#230:1>
<quote> " I love you too, best friend," </quote> I said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#231:1>
And stood there with Shannon, his hand in mine. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-009#232:1>
And together, we watched the sunset. </I>
