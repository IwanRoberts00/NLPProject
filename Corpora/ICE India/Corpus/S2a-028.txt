<I>  

<$A>
<ICE-IND:S2A-028#1:1:A>
Doctor Agarwal and my <,,> and professor Pandya and my friends  
<,,> it is my <,> previlege to be with you <,,> and uh <,> whatever doctor  
Agarwal has said it is exaggerating it <,> uh form or thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#2:1:A>
I do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#3:1:A>
Only thing is that uh <,,> I have been <,,> throughout a teacher  
<,,> and a very long career of a teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#4:1:A>
Earlier I was in uh <,,> Rajghat <?> Baseti </?> school <,,> a  
foundation for new education society <,,> run by doctor J Krishnamurthy <,>  
Foundation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#5:1:A>
And uh then I <,> heard him <,,> in fact I had no intention to  
become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor Krishnamurthy  
<,,> which was <,> which had <-> changed </-> brought a change in my  
attitudes in life <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#6:1:A>
I have not become disciple of anybody so far <,,> but most of these  
philosophers <,> had been uh <,> having some or the other impact on me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#7:1:A>
And I remember Krishnamurthy <,> as saying that when you want to  
create something new <,> you have to start afresh <,,> you can't uh <,> begin  
with the middle <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#8:1:A>
And if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot <,>  
create something new <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#9:1:A>
Well I do not know how to start afresh because wherever I have gone  
I had <,,> got an established institution <,> of course <,> my studies I have  
started afresh <,> and of course there I have been able to create <,,> a new  
discipline in the Botany <,,> department of Banaras Hindu University <,>  
discipline of micro- ecology in which some <,> twenty-five research scholars  
have got doctorate <,,> and a couple of them are registered <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#10:1:A>
Straight away I joined this college <,,> uh uh soon after passing  
my university <,,> and uh <,> I am not that smart <,> to run here and there  
<,> for a better job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#11:1:A>
Whatever I got I wanted to make it better <,,> most suitable for me  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#12:1:A>
And here the people are so <,,> wise and intelligent <,> that they  
moulded me into a science educationist <,,> and being <,> a botanist <,> and  
then a science educationist and then environmentologist <,,> and then  
ecologist <,> and so many <,> ist were added to my name and then ultimately I  
became <,,> a <,> expert in uh <,> out of science school science activity  
<,,> and UNESCO accepted me as expert and resource person and sent me <,> to  
work two three places <,> along with an Australian <,> resource person and a  
Canadian resource person <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#13:1:A>
So the credit goes to our my great country <,> which has a variety  
of states and very intelligent people we are <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#14:1:A>
I can tell you <,,> because I have seen many people and I have  
studied in United States of America also and I find <,,> that their entire  
life and thinking process is just mechanical <,,> whereas our thinking  
process is radical <,> and rather more philosophical <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#15:1:A>
That is why we think very high <,> but when we achieve little we  
get frustrated <,,> unnecessarily because this is <,,> just because when you  
think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#16:1:A>
We are no way inferior to any nation <,,> in the world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#17:1:A>
And I am very sure and very <,> hopeful <,> that India will emerge  
<,> as one of the strongest <,> and well built nation <,> uh by the year two  
thousand <,> is over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#18:1:A>
And uh <,,> regarding this particular programme <,> I have only one  
thing to say <,> that if India has to sustain <,,> as a great nation <,> it  
will have to show the greatness <,,> which <,,> is required for a nation as  
well as for individuals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#19:1:A>
And the greatness in Indian philosophy is <,,> <indig> dhairya  
</indig> that is patience <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#20:1:A>
You have to listen to others with great patience <,,> tolerate his  
views <,,> <indig> vidya </indig> education <,,> another aspect <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#21:1:A>
<indig> Dhairya <,> vidya </indig> and then bravery <,,> you are  
coming from <w> Shivaji's </w> place <,,> who was the <,> I think bravest  
person in our country ever born <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#22:1:A>
And of course patriotism is there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#23:1:A>
Now this is all regarding that <indig> dhairya </indig> business  
<,,> whatever we are going to do <,> because tolerance comes when you <,,>  
tolerate others <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#24:1:A>
There may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a  
particular question or <}> <-> <.> pasen </.> </-> <=> presenting </=> </}> a  
particular question a <,> subject in the text <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#25:1:A>
Say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of India  
<,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#26:1:A>
Which they said <,> they say <indig> sanskriti </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#27:1:A>
From which period we should count the history of India <,,> from  
Vedic period <,> Aryan period <,> or the Medieval period <,> or post  
Independence period <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#28:1:A>
The <,> <-> that </-> India which was existing in Vedic period is  
no more that India existing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#29:1:A>
The India of Medieval ages have also gone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#30:1:A>
And India born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline <,>  
from which we should think ahead <,,> and think about building a strong  
nation 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#31:1:A>
Whatever is there it is <,> we cannot call it partition India <,>  
in fact that much part of India was made free <,> and made available to us  
<,> to live in <,> and to work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#32:1:A>
The government of India is uh <,,> very much worried about certain  
aspects of national integration <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#33:1:A>
And also atrocities on <,> women <,,> uh either in the written form  
or verbal or gestural or what sort <,,> what may be the gists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#34:1:A>
Say for example <,,> if somebody quotes <,> a particualr religion  
<,,> or a text of a religion <,,> others get hurt <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#35:1:A>
Now why should we do it <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#36:1:A>
If <-> he is if if </-> <,> my words are hurting somebody we should  
avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions  
like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#37:1:A>
So if <,> if you want to maintain this <,,> secular infrastructure  
of this country <,> we have to be very cautious in dealing with <,> variety  
of people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#38:1:A>
And accordingly this committee has been set up <,,> to scrutinize  
<,,> the question papers of Maharashtra and Gujarat <,,> to see if there are  
some anamolies <,,> and also to <,,> suggest methods of <,,> avoiding those  
anamolies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#39:1:A>
Recently we received a letter from the council <,,> they they also  
want the original question papers <,,> which you will be scrutinizing so we  
will be dispatching this whole bunch <,> to the headquarters also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#40:1:A>
So that <,,> India remains as India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#41:1:A>
India remains as a secular India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#42:1:A>
And uh <,,> nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was  
done therefore this has <-> been this has </-> happened <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#43:1:A>
So <,,> to build up a real strong national character <,,> this step  
is essential <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#44:1:A>
We have <}> <-> <.> al </.> </-> <=> already </=> </}> analysed the  
textbooks of various languages and various states <,,> on several aspects  
like uh <,> bias <,,> uh religious bias or political bias or the <,>  
atrocities on women <,> folk and bias also 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#45:1:A>
I remember one instance in a <,,> textbook it was cited <,,> that  
Ram asked Sita <,> to go and fetch a <,> bucketful of water from the well  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#46:1:A>
The objection was raised <,,> why Seeta should go to fetch water  
<,> why not Ram should go <,,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#47:1:A>
Uh the male dominance is not liked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#48:1:A>
Of course we should do away with that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#49:1:A>
Too much dominance of female is also not good <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#50:1:A>
It happens in our homes <,,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#51:1:A>
So <,,> we do away with that and you do away with this <,,> <O>  
laughter </O> to make our <}> <-> <.> li </.> </-> <=> life </=> </}> <,>  
happier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#52:1:A>
So <,> all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#53:1:A>
Don't think that this will be the final <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#54:1:A>
You may be again invited another team may come <,> to do further uh  
<,> screening of the question paper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#55:1:A>
Because if somebody wants to be hurt <,,> he need not even <,,>  
read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt <,,> <O>  
laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#56:1:A>
What we see that <,> uh some people say that I am allergic to that  
gentleman whenever I see him <,,> <O> laughter </O> I get annoyed 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#57:1:A>
<w> It's </w> alright <,> you have every right to be annoyed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#58:1:A>
That is what happens in the college also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#59:1:A>
Wherever there is a society of human beings <,> some people you  
will always find annoyed <,> annoyed <,,> unnecessarily <,,> no reason behind  
it but simply they are annoyed <w> that's </w> all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#60:1:A>
And you can't do anything <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#61:1:A>
Similarly here also you see only that <,,> the religious questions  
and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there <,> and if  
they are there how they can be moulded <,,> to <,> keep the <,> uh views of  
the people <,> in their <,> desirable limit or you can say <,> that this it  
should not be feeling should not be hurt <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#62:1:A>
Now as a teacher I find that our role is the most difficult role  
which the society has given to us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#63:1:A>
We have made it easier <,,> by simply visiting the class and <,,>  
telling whatever little you know <,> to the students and then thinking that  
your job is over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#64:1:A>
But if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that  
your life span is very little <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#65:1:A>
I feel that at the fag end of my career <,,> say only five or six  
years are left <,,> I feel that I have been able to achieve very little in  
this <,,> and a lot of things are to be done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#66:1:A>
And I wish that I <,,> live for another hundred years <,> to see  
<,> a real good teacher <,> being produced <,> <w> it's </w> very difficult  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#67:1:A>
When I see the plight of our young people <,,> when I see the  
unemployment <,,> when I see the students struggling here for nothing <,,>  
and uhn <-> others </-> other such cases also I intend <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#68:1:A>
And in this college also <,,> I am only doing my routine duty <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#69:1:A>
Routine duties are so heavy <,> that you cannot just do the other  
things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#70:1:A>
So my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#71:1:A>
To keep myself fresh I still <}> <-> continuing </-> <=> continue  
</=> </}> taking a couple of classes <,> so that <,> that compels me to learn  
<,> and to go to the class <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#72:1:A>
Otherwise <,,> this college or any other college they are all true  
reflection of whatever society we have <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#73:1:A>
Now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#74:1:A>
So as a community <,,> I am warning you <,,> especially there is  
nothing to warn to people of Maharashtra and Goa <,> they are wonderful <,,>  
in our region <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#75:1:A>
When I make a comparison <,> only <,,> last week on Wednesday I was  
at Ahmedabad <,,> uh talking to the <,> chief executives of <,> education  
department <,> with chief secretary and education secretary <,> and directors  
of education and boards and all these people sitting <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#76:1:A>
I said <,,> <quote> If you ask me to compare <,,> between the  
different <-> between different </-> states of the region <,> I will say <,,>  
Goa <,,> and Maharashtra are the best <,,> because the people are there  
sincere they want to work <,> they want to work hard <,,> </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#77:1:A>
And then comes <,,> Madhya Pradesh <,,> and Gujarat is the last  
state <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#78:1:A>
And you must take care of this thing why Gujarat is <,> lagging  
behind <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#79:1:A>
Why your teachers are not coming forward <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#80:1:A>
If we invite fifty teachers from Gujarat five come <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#81:1:A>
Fifty-five are forty-five are absent <,,> without reason <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#82:1:A>
Then one of them remarked <,,> that it is because they are all  
doing tuitions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#83:1:A>
So <-> that is you to </-> <,> that is you to go into it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#84:1:A>
And this is this condition so they said that <quote> I will send  
<,,> one person top officer at Regional College of Education Bhopal </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#85:1:A>
He will be visiting us very shortly <,,> to find out the problems  
of Gujarati students <,,> students of Gujarat state <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#86:1:A>
That how is it <,,> there problems are genuine <,,> they do not  
know any language other than Gujarati <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#87:1:A>
They don't neither follow English <,,> nor Hindi <,,> and we don't  
know <,,> Gujarati at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#88:1:A>
So how can we communicate with them <,> so they are sitting in the  
classroom <,,> with open mouth <,> and blank faces <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#89:1:A>
So I said <quote> You introduce English <,> in Gujarat state also  
like other states <,,> because English is going to stay in our country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#90:1:A>
It is such a language <,> which cannot simply be thrown out <,> by  
even order <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#91:1:A>
Hindi will replace English in some hundred years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#92:1:A>
It is not a matter of <,,> say <,> a decade or two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#93:1:A>
So he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a  
report <,> and submit it to the Gujarat government <,,> </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#94:1:A>
So <w> teachers' </w> job is a very difficult job I tell you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#95:1:A>
And more you get <,> bobbed down into it <,> more you will be in  
trouble <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#96:1:A>
But <,> you should be a real teacher <,,> not just an orator of  
your subject <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#97:1:A>
And for that <,> you have to <,> have a very deep understanding <->  
your </-> of your subject <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#98:1:A>
You know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#99:1:A>
And there only upto <,,> recall and memory type of thing <,> that  
is knowledge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#100:1:A>
And in knowledge <,> when knowledge enters you develop  
understanding <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#101:1:A>
We have done away with understanding part <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#102:1:A>
And when you achieve understanding <,,> then you develop  
application of knowledge <,> and skill <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#103:1:A>
That is why Indians are more philosophical <,,> than <,,> more  
skilled people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#104:1:A>
So these things we have to <}> <-> <.> inculcul </.> </-> <=>  
inculcate </=> </}> among the students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#105:1:A>
Your job <,> is very simple one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#106:1:A>
And I think such a galaxy of stars <,,> will be able to complete  
it <,> within a day or two or three not more than that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#107:1:A>
And I will request doctor Agarwal <,> the moment you complete your  
work <,> you may be free to go to your places <,> because <-> we want uh </->  
<,> we want only a report on the analysis of question paper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#108:1:A>
So I have to attend another meeting at four <,,> so I take leave  
from you people thanking you very much <,,> to have come <-> to come </->  
over here <,> and to do this particular type of job <,> <-> which not </->  
which may not be to your taste I am sure <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#109:1:A>
But still <,> we have to do with them 

<ICE-IND:S2A-028#110:1:A>
Thank you very much <,,> <O> clapping </O> </I>
