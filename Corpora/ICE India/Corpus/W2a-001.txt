<h> <bold> ANALYSIS AS A METHOD IN PHILOSOPHY WITH <&> centered </&>
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO A. J. AYER </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#4:1>
The 20th century analysts are unanimous in their claim that the
subject matter of philosophy is language and its legitimate method is
analysis. <sp> 1 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#5:1>
For, they conceive that philosophy, unlike other disciplines such as
Botany, Zoology, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy etc., does not have any
subject matter of its own to deal with.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#6:1>
In order to save philosophy from this rather awkward situation
analysts claim that they have assigned a special function to philosophy which
is a unique feature of philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#7:1>
The assigned function of philosophy is the logical clarification of
our everyday language and science.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#8:1>
By analysing the concepts of everyday language and science, analysts
felt that the so-called philosophical puzzles can be solved.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#9:1>
A.J.Ayer, who was a chief patron of logical positivist movement in
Britain, holds the view that a philosopher neither does indulge in
experimentation nor does he patiently observe the behaviour of any natural
objects, yet the statements of a philosopher purport to provide us <quote> `
knowledge' </quote> which is different from the <quote> ` knowledge'
</quote> of science.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#10:1>
Then the question before Ayer was what kind of <quote> ` knowledge'
</quote> does philosophical analysts provide us ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#11:1>
To put it simply-what then is philosophical analysis ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#12:1>
In an attempt to answer this question, Ayer maintains that
philosophical analysis is concerned with the use and function of language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#13:1>
This analysis, according to Ayer, attempts to rewrite the sentences
of everyday language and science in such a way that these sentences exhibit
their proper <O> Received : 3 - 4 - 1990 </O> <&> page no. </&> <O> 112 </O>
logical form; consequently their meaning becomes clear.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#14:1>
As a result of this approach, believes Ayer, the traditional problems
of philosophy are found to disappear.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#15:1>
He opines that the problems of philosophy appear and reappear due to
muddled thinking and this muddled thinking itself is largely the product of
our improper use of language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#16:1>
In what follow I have made a sincere attempt to show the futility
of analysis as a method in the aquisition of knowledge of objective reality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#17:1>
In other words, <w> Ayer's </w> notion of philosophy deprives
philosophy of its empirical content.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#18:1>
In addition to that <w> Ayer's </w> supposition that the sole
function of philosophy is mere analysis of language is not at all convincing
as philosophy does not confine to one particular subject matter or the other.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#19:1>
In order to accomplish our project, let us examine the views of Ayer
with regard to nature and method of philosophy. </p> <&> centered </&> I

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#20:1>
Trying to vindicate his claim, namely, the sole function of
philosophy is logical analysis of language, Ayer views that philosophy is not
a search for <quote> ` first principles' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#21:1>
This is because <quote> ` the foundation of these first principles to
provide certain basis for our knowledge, it is clear that they are not to be
found among the so-called laws of nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#22:1>
For, we shall see that the <quote> ` laws of nature' </quote> , if
they are not mere definitions, they are simply hypotheses which may be
confuted by experience' </quote> . <sp> 2 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#23:1>
Ayer argues that the <quote> ` first principles' </quote> are not
deduced from an intuitively preceived truth upon the basis of which a
philosopher proceeds to construct a deductive system.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#24:1>
They are, contends Ayer, no objects of speculative knowledge which
lie beyond empirical investigation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#25:1>
If one wants to deduce all knowledge from the <quote> ` first
principles' </quote> without trespassing into <quote> ` metaphysics' </quote>
, then one must take a priori truths as his premises.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#26:1>
And from one set <&> page no. </&> <O> 113 </O> of a priori truths (
tautologies) one can deduce another set of a priori truths. <sp> 3 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#27:1>
Thus, Ayer envisages that it is not possible to deduce all our
knowledge from the <quote> ` first principles.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#28:1>
It implies that there is some amount of knowledge that can be derived
from the <quote> ` first principles' </quote> ( a priori truths).

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#29:1>
Then it is none other than the knowledge of logic and mathematics.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#30:1>
In the first place, <w> Ayer's </w> attack on the view that
philosophy is a search for <quote> ` first principles' </quote> can be
understood as an attempt to disapprove Cartesian view-point.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#31:1>
For, Descartes aimed at making philosophy as exact as mathematics.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#32:1>
By virtue of his commitment to this view, Descartes had to look for
the <quote> ` first and indubitable' </quote> foundations or principles of
philosophy from which a consistent philosophical system can be constructed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#33:1>
In addition to that, Descartes relied on two important powers of
human reason, namely, intuition and deduction as two main tools of his
inquiry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#34:1>
According to Ayer, the knowledge deduced from such premises cannot
have any informative content since one set of analytic truths leads us to
another set of analytical truths.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#35:1>
He also maintains that the <quote> ` first principles' </quote>
cannot be found among the so-called <quote> ` laws of nature' </quote> for,
the laws of nature can be confuted by experience.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#36:1>
Consequently, it is not possible to derive the <quote> ` first
principles' </quote> either from intution or from senseexperiance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#37:1>
What is spurious with <w> Ayer's </w> notion is that he could not
distinguish between the <quote> ` laws of nature' </quote> and mere <quote> `
statements of tendency' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#38:1>
A law is something which does not fail to occur in a given set of
conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#39:1>
Laws of nature are well established scientific truths.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#40:1>
They can neither be verified nor be falsified.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#41:1>
<w> Ayer's </w> main contention is to show that the activity of
philosophizing does not involve in the search for <quote> ` first principles'
</quote> What then does this activity of philosophizing consist of? </p> <O>
<&> page </&> 114 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#42:1>
Ayer asserts that the activity of philosophizing is essentially
analytic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#43:1>
In support of his assertion Ayer holds that <quote> " those who are
commonly called philosophers have actually been engaged in carrying out
analyses." </quote> <sp> 4 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#44:1>
Not only that, <quote> " it can be shown that the majority of those
who are commonly supposed to have been great philosophers were primarily not
mataphysicans but analysts" </quote> . <sp> 5 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#45:1>
From this it follows that to be a philosopher one needs to be an
analyst.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#46:1>
Apart from that, the greatness of any philosopher lies in his being
an analyst rather than a speculator.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#47:1>
Accordingly, Ayer considers his empiricist predecessors ( Locke,
Berkeley and Hume) as great.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#48:1>
Of Locke and Berkeley, Ayer writes that Locke was not a common-sense
philosopher in the sense in which G E. More is a common-sense philosopher.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#49:1>
Neither he ( Locke) tried to prove common-sense beliefs on a priori
grounds, nor he affirmed or denied the validity of any empirical matter but
only analysed them in terms of sense-experience

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#50:1>
Similarly, Berkeley was not a metaphysician as he was commonly
understood to be.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#51:1>
Like Locke, he too was indulged in analysing the reality of material
things. <sp> 6 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#52:1>
As a matter of fact, Ayer follows the footsteps of his empiricist
predecessors Berkeley and Hume in reducing the statements about material
objects to statements about sense-data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#53:1>
The phenomenalistic analysis of material objects of Berkeley and
Hume has been converted into linguistic phenomenalism.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#54:1>
The very purpose of this reductionist analysis is to show that the
existence of material objects is somehow inferred from the sense-data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#55:1>
With regard to Hume, Ayer says that Hume is opposed to metaphysics (
transcendental kind of metaphysics).

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#56:1>
It is only a belief that Hume has put forward the views concerning
the nature of philosophical proposition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#57:1>
In fact, what is considered to be philosophical are his works of
analysis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#58:1>
The whole misunderstanding about <w> Hume's </w> philosophical
position is the outcome of his treat <O> <&> page </&> 115 </O> ment of
causation that is often misunderstood. <sp> 7 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#59:1>
Ayer himself advocates the same Humean conception.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#60:1>
While dealing with the nature of causation Ayer writes that <quote> "
our conception of causation is the same as his ( Hume's)." </quote> <sp> 8
</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#61:1>
In this way Ayer illustrates that the activity of analysis is an
unique feature of British Empiricists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#62:1>
According to Ayer, philosopher as an analyst is not concerned
with <quote> ` facts' </quote> or <quote> ` notions' </quote> or <quote> `
things' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#63:1>
In other words, the propositions of philosophy are not factual but
only linguistic in their nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#64:1>
They express definitions or formal consequences of definitions. <sp>
9 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#65:1>
In this way, Ayer, a professed empiricist, dispences with all
empirical facts as irrelevant to philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#66:1>
For him a philosopher is only concerned with the stipulative
definitions of his own inventions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#67:1>
It is clear from the following passage of Ayer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#68:1>
I must say not that I see the cigarette case, if this is to carry
the implication that there is a cigarette case there, but it only seems to me
that I am seeing it... the next step, continuing our example, is to convert
the sentence <quote> ` it now seems to me that I see a cigarette case'
</quote> into <quote> ` I am now seeing a seeming cigarette case <+> ' </+>
</quote> <-> ! </->

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#69:1>
And this seeming cigarette case, which lives only in my present
experience, is an example of a sense-datum. <sp> 10 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#70:1>
Indeed, it is in a pickwickian sense, i.e., regardless of their
actual or literal sense, that <quote> ` facts' </quote> or <quote> ` notions'
</quote> or <quote> ` things' </quote> can be analysed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#71:1>
Proceeding further, Ayer tries to distinguish philosophy from
other sciences

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#72:1>
With regard to philosophy Ayer holds that philosophy is distinguished
from other arts and sciences not because of its methods but because of its
subject matter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#73:1>
Philosophers utter statements which are intended to be factual but in
the final analysis it is realised that they are not the statements <O> <&>
page </&> 116 </O> about matters of fact.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#74:1>
The theories of philosophy are not tested by any observation. <sp> 11
</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#75:1>
What follows from the above assertions of Ayer is that the questions
such as whether the material objects are real, whether objects continue to
exist at times when they are not perceived, cannot be decided on the basis of
scientific information.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#76:1>
According to Ayer, these are not the questions which could be settled
by observation but can be resolved on the basis of analysis of language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#77:1>
To quote <w> Ayer's </w> remarks in this context, <quote> " What is
in dispute in such cases is not whether, in a given set of circumstances,
this or that event will happen, but rather how anything at all that happens
is to be described." </quote> <sp> 12 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#78:1>
In short, the activity of philosophical analysis consists in
providing definitions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#79:1>
Regarding the nature of philosophical analysis, Ayer holds the
view that the definitions which philosophy provides are not <quote> `
explicit definitions' </quote> but <quote> ` definitions in use' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#80:1>
In an attempt to illustrate this point, Ayer writes that <quote> " a
lexicographer also seeks to give information about the usage of words, but
the philosophers differ from him in being concerned... but with the use of
particular expressions and whereas the propositions of the lexicographer are
empirical, philosophical propositions, if they are true, are usually
analytic." </quote> <sp> 13 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#81:1>
Thus a lexicographer is considered to be an empirical scientist who
glosses antecedent facts, whereas the true propositions of philosophy do not
express anything new but only clarify what is already expressed by the
propositions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#82:1>
In short <quote> ` the definitions in use' </quote> show <quote> "
how the sentences in which it ( a symbol) significantly occurs can be
translated into equivalent sentences, which contain neither the definition
itself nor any of its synonyms" </quote> . <sp> 14 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#83:1>
The very purpose of philosophical analysis, according to Ayer is to
translate certain sentences into their equivalents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#84:1>
For example, the sentence <quote> ` The round square does not
exist'</quote>, is equivalent to <quote> ` No one thing can be both square
and round' </quote> , and the sentence <quote> ` The author of Waverley <O>
<&> page </&> 117 </O> was Scotch <quote> ` is equivalent to' </quote> One
person only, wrote Waverley, and that person was Scotch' </quote> . <sp> 15
</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#85:1>
Susan Stebbing in her review article on <w> Ayer's </w> <it>
Language, Truth and Logic </it> points out that the statement <quote> ` The
author of Waverley was Scotch' </quote> is translated into an equivalent
statement or sentence that <quote> ` One person, and one person only wrote
Waverley and that person was Scotch' </quote> violates the rules of analysis
provided by Ayer Stebbing argues that if the word <quote> " that" </quote> is
used referentially, then <quote> " that person was Scotch" </quote> is
equivalent to the whole of the original; and it it is used demonstratively,
the defining expression <quote> " is not a translation of the original at
all " </quote> . <sp> 16 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#86:1>
In defence of his position against <w> Stebbing's </w> criticism,
Ayer argues that <quote> " the object of analysing <quote> ` The author of
waverley was Scotch' </quote> is not just to obtain an accurate translation
of this particular sentence, but to elucidate the use of a whole class of
expressions, of which <quote> ` the author of Waverley' </quote> serves
merely a typical example" </quote> . <sp> 17 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#87:1>
According to Ayer, the examples of this kind are only meant to show
how certain class of expressions can be explained in our ordinary language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#88:1>
If a philosopher sticks to this kind of analysis, claims Ayer, he
will avoid either interfering in the sphere of natural science or involve
himself in metaphysics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#89:1>
In an attempt to define an ambiguous symbol, Ayer states that
<quote> " a symbol is constituted by signs which are identical with one
another in their sensible form, and in their significance, and that a sign is
a sense-content, or a series of sense-contents, which is used to convey
literal meaning, is not to say that a symbol is a collection of system of
sense-contents." </quote> <sp> 18 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#90:1>
From the above statement of Ayer we can deduce that he is heading for
reductive analysis' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#91:1>
Every symbol is reduced to signs which are identical in their
sensible form.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#92:1>
This kind of <quote> ` reductive analysis' </quote> as Ayer believes
is equally applicable to material object state ments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#93:1>
This is to say that the statement about material objects <O> <&> page
</&> 118 </O> can be translated, without residue, into the statements about
sense-data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#94:1>
Ayer presupposes <quote> " the problem of giving an actual rule for
translating sentences about material things into sentences about
sense-contents, which may be called the problem of the <quote> ` reduction'
</quote> of material things to sense-contents, is main philosophical part
of the traditional problem of perception." </quote> <sp> 19 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#95:1>
Ayer states that the reason for adopting this reductive analysis is
to eliminate certain problematic entities and to replace them with relatively
less problematic entities <sp> 20 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#96:1>
It implies that the propositions that express the facts of
ordinary perceptual knowledge are not simple, and so are not the ultimate
constituents of reality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#97:1>
For example, the expressions such as <quote> ` table',`chair'
</quote> etc, are problematic in the sense that they are philosophically
disputable entities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#98:1>
And when the propositions containing such expressions are analysed,
then they will be expressed in terms of ultimate constituents of knowledge (
sense-data).

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#99:1>
In other words, the ordinary unanalysed knowledge seems to be about
such things as <quote> ` table',`chairs' </quote> etc., but analysis will
make clear the ultimate constituents of knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#100:1>
In this way, Ayer identifies philosophy with analysis and claims
that <quote> " the only positive contribution that philosophy can make to
knowledge is in the field of analysis" </quote> . <sp> 21 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-001#101:1>
Thus Ayer who does not wish to break too finally the
empiricist tradition could maintain that Berkeley in his analysis of
<quote> ` physical objects' </quote> , Hume in his analysis of causation were
doing philosophy as conceived by logical positivists.

<ICE-IND:W2A-001#102:1>
The business is still the old reductive analysis ( phenomenalism)
even if it is under new management. </p> </I>
