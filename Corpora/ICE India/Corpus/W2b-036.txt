<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#5:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> EVER </smallcaps> </bold> since Steven Jobs,
designer of the Apple Macintosh personal computer was forced out of Apple
Computers Inc., there were rumours that he was on to something big.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#6:1>
Soon he was working on a new machine designed to bring the power of
minicomputers and mainframes on to the desktop. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#7:1>
He had previously brought out Macintosh and so demonstrated
that a computer need not be difficult to operate nor involve learning endless
sets of commands and syntax.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#8:1>
The <w> Macintosh's </w> user interface introduced the idea of
pull-down menus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#9:1>
In this new approach, functions are arranged in a set of ` menus' and
all that a user need to do is <quote> ` pull down' </quote> a particular menu
and choose the command that was to be executed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#10:1>
The arrival of the <quote> ` mouse' </quote> a handy sliding desktop
controller which eliminated the need for <O> <&> page </&> 72 </O> <&> middle
of first column </&> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> moving the cursor
with arrow keys, was yet another mile-stone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#11:1>
Macintosh brought a totally different concept into desktop
computing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#12:1>
From then on, all software developers focussed on making their
packages as user-friendly as possible and many used screens that imitated
the Mac. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#13:1>
The long-awaited system, the NeXT ( pronounced <quote> ` next'
</quote> ) , was unveiled in San Francisco in October 1988.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#14:1>
The information impact of NeXT was administered in one big punch,
instead of feeding several incomplete scraps of information in a manner
similar to that used in packages like dBASE IV and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3,
etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#15:1>
The main unit of the NeXT computer is a black-coloured 30 cm
cube with a single power cable for connection to the mains.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#16:1>
Power is supplied to the monitor, keyboard and <O> <&> page </&> 73
</O> <O> next entire page </O> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O. 
 <O> <&>
page </&> 74 </O> <&> column one </&> other devices outside the cube through
a cable connecting the main unit to the monitor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#17:1>
The keyboard is connected to a socket in the mionitor unit ( and not
to the main machine as is the case in other desktop machines ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#18:1>
The monitor unit has speaker sockets for stereo output and a
microphone socket, while the mouse is connected to the keyboard. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#19:1>
The system is built around a Motorola 32-bit microprocessor
68030 ( operating at 25 M Hz, a performance figure of 5 MIPS or million
instructions per second) supported by a 68882 math co-processor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#20:1>
There is also a 56001 digital signal processor which NeXT uses to
synthesize high-quality stereo sound.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#21:1>
The high speed of the main processor gives NeXT the capability to
generate highly realistic animated three-dimensional simulations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#22:1>
The random access memory ( RAM) that comes along with the system
is a whooping 7 megabytes ( MB).

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#23:1>
This can be increased to 16 MB if needed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#24:1>
There is also a version with only 4 MB memory for those who think 8
MB is too much, in comparison, the standard IBM PC has a memory size of
256 Kilobytes ( KB) expandable up to 512 KB.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#25:1>
At present, the monitor is an ultra-high-resolution monochrome
monitor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#26:1>
( A point which many critics noted since colour graphics would have
been ideal.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#27:1>
But that was a compromise required in design. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#28:1>
The monitor can be easily tilted forwards or backwards and it has
tractor-style wheels at its base so that it can be moved across a table. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#29:1>
In any computer system, the raw speed of the central processing
unit ( CPU ) is not sufficient to increase the speed of program execution
which ultimately decides the through-put of the system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#30:1>
The CPU, could get bogged down by slow peripherals and may have to
wait to service many input / output ( I/O ) cells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#31:1>
Designers have long since recognized this difficulty and tried to
off-load all such activities to other indpendent processors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#32:1>
For example, when the first 8-bit microprocessor was introduced,
there were peripheral chips which handled memory, I/O as well as clock /
timer functiions all in one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#33:1>
From then onwards designers began to distribute the total work and
employ specific peripheral chips for each function.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#34:1>
That lead to the development of the I/O controller, bus controller,
clock, interrupt controller, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#35:1>
Each was a separate chip doing only what it was best equipped for.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#36:1>
The initial microprocessor 8085 had four hardware interrupt lines,
though later generation ( 8086 / 8088s ) had only one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#37:1>
The idea was to allocate that work to a different chip.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#38:1>
NeXT takes this design ideology to its logical conclusion by
having a number of specialist chips for handling peripherals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#39:1>
In most computer systems, the digital signal processor ( DSP)
is used primarily for speech synthesis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#40:1>
However, its design is such that it can be useful in a number of
applications like voice recognition, image processing, filtering of
digital data, mathematical operations, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#41:1>
The DSP works with 24-bit data and can be programmed for any specific
application.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#42:1>
For example, it can be programmed to function as a 10-band graphic
equalizer for a digital stereosystem.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#43:1>
During the unveiling function of NeXT the sound synthesizer was used
to generate a thunderstorm and Martin Luther <w> King's </w> speech entitled
<quote> ` I have a dream' </quote> , with excellent effects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#44:1>
Mass storage devices are products of the latest technology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#45:1>
Ever since the arrival of CD-ROM ( compact disc read only memory - -
see box ) , attempts were being made to design <O> <&> second column </&> three
photographs one below another </O> <O> <&> page </&> 75 </O> <&> in the
center of the page </&> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> an optical
or magneto-optical system which can write as well as read.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#46:1>
This was of great interest to computer manufacturers since the
data storage in optical disks was exceedingly high - - of the order of
hundred of megabytes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#47:1>
The hitch with CD-ROM was that it can only be read - - like an LP
record - - but cannot be used to write any data.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#48:1>
The data had to be programmed earlier at the manufacturing point of
the disk.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#49:1>
NeXT uses the first commercially available erasable optical disk (
from Canon).

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#50:1>
It comes with an erasable optical disk drive of 256 MB data storage
capacity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#51:1>
Compare this with the standard 360 KB floppy disks or even the 20 MB
hard disk which comes with an IBM PC-XT and to get some idea of the amount of
data that can be stored in a single disk.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#52:1>
Moreover, the 256 MB ` floppies' can be removed and carried around,
just like conventional floppy disks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#53:1>
They are not very big either - - only slightly bigger than 8.75 cm (
3 1/2-inch ) floppy disks and can contain as much data as that contained in
over 700 ordinary 360 KB floppies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#54:1>
Also available as extras are 330 MB and 660 MB conventional
hard disks which will give a better speed of data access.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#55:1>
Because of the high-capacity optical disks, the entire Unix
operating system along with applications and utilities ( with lots of space
still left for adding other data), becomes portable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#56:1>
The machine does not have any floppy disk drives, which makes one
wonder whether all the software to be developed for NeXT will have to be
on the optical disk.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#57:1>
The usual packages would definitely not require 256 MB of space. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#58:1>
The display screen ( or the monitor ) gives crisp graphics
because of the 1,120 by 832 pixel display that NeXT uses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#59:1>
( Pixels are picture elements, the number of dots that make a
picture. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#60:1>
The NeXT display is made up of 1,120 dots lengthwise and 832
heightwise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#61:1>
In contrast, the standard IBM PC graphics screen gives 320 by 200 in
the colour graphics mode and 640 by 200 in the high resolution mode.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#62:1>
( Incidentally, all the comparisons being done with IBM PC <O> <&>
page </&> 76 </O> are only for the purpose of understanding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#63:1>
NeXT is not comparable with a personal computer - - it belongs to a
totally different class of machines.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#64:1>
<w> NeXT's </w> capability to handle stereo sound will be useful
in voice mail.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#65:1>
Like its electronic counterpart, users of voice mail can leave
messages by speaking into a microphone while the computer stores them in
digital form.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#66:1>
Messages can be addressed to a particular person in a network who
will be able to retrieve them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#67:1>
The message will be <quote> ` heard' </quote> by the receiver (
provided, of course, he or she has a machine with similar capability.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#68:1>
Apart from this, NeXT supports networking and built-in Ethernet
interface. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#69:1>
NeXT has its own graphical-user interface.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#70:1>
The general design is on the lines of the Apple Macintosh interface (
see photograph ) , though the screens are not duplications of the Mac
screens.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#71:1>
The operating system is Unix - - but with an easy-to-use interface so
that the laborious Unix commands are not an annoyance to the user.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#72:1>
NeXT uses the Mach kernel with some enhancements.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#73:1>
Mach kernel was developed by Carnegie-Mellon University, and is
compatible with the well-known Berkeley Standard Edition Version 4.3.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#74:1>
The user interface is called the Workspace Manager and through
this most of the Unix commands can be issued for file management,
communication, accessing peripherals, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#75:1>
Another important aspect is the development environment
offered by NeXT.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#76:1>
Many reviewers are quite impressed by it though big software houses
are yet to declare any serious plans to develop software for NeXT.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#77:1>
Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, reportedly said that he was
disappointed with the new machine because most of the new features it
boasts of are trivial.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#78:1>
Gates has reason to be unhappy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#79:1>
Because IBM has decided to use <w> NeXT's </w> user interface, <w>
Microsoft's </w> OS/2-Presentation Manager was under threat.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#80:1>
If IBM finds that OS/2-Presentation Manager combine is too slow to
take off, there is a possibility that they may come out with a NeXT-type
operating system as an alternative to MS-DOS.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#81:1>
On the other hand, many others have gone too far saying that NeXT is
the ultimate dream power machine for the developer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#82:1>
Only time can tell who is right.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#83:1>
<w> NeXT's </w> Display Postscript, a screen display standard from
Adobe is another important step forward.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#84:1>
Ideally, this offers the possibility of developing
machine-independent screen displays.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#85:1>
Postscript is the well-known page description standard for laser
printers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#86:1>
Display Postscript is an adaptation for graphic displays.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#87:1>
IBM has decided to use this as standard software in its own version
of the Unix operating system workstations - - the AIX system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#88:1>
This is a significant move since software developers will now be
encouraged to produce packages for IBM which will also run on NeXT.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#89:1>
Thus, NeXT gets over the problem that Macintosh faced during its
early days - - that of producing software for a product which has no
compatibles around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#90:1>
Other development tools offered by NeXT are futuristic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#91:1>
Object-oriented programming ( OOP), which is expected to gain
importance in near future, finds a place in NeXT.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#92:1>
<w> NeXT's </w> C-language compiler, Objective-C, supports OOP.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#93:1>
Also available is a standard library called Application Toolkit,
which contains all the usually needed functions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#94:1>
A program called interface Builder is provided in the machine, in
order to interactively develop user interfaces.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#95:1>
Apart from these, there are programs for working with sound and
music.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#96:1>
NeXT will also provide word-processing and other packages with the
machine.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#97:1>
The company also hopes to provide text books, reference materials,
dictionaries and literary works in disk-form ( along with software to help
locate what is needed ) , to educational institutions, by utilizing its
256 MB magneto-optical disc capacity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#98:1>
<w> NeXT's </w> current marketing plans are restricted to
promoting the machine in the educational-academic market, which though
limited could prove to be significant on a long-term basis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#99:1>
Some observers feel that funds required to develop an extensive
marketing network could be the reason why NeXT has ignored other markets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#100:1>
As quantities increase, the machine should be available to another
segments as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#101:1>
All things considered, NeXT was planned with an eye on the
future.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#102:1>
Whether it will become a success story is debatable since this
depends on various other factors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#103:1>
However, the present strategy of aiming at the educational
market, was devised to-ensure that it captures enough attention in future.

<bold> CD-ROMS ARE ERASABLE OPTICAL DISKS </BOLD> <bold>
<smallcaps> CD-ROMs </smallcaps> </bold> or compact disc read only memories are
a result of developments in consumer electronics rather than in the
computer industry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#105:1>
the search for super hi-fi sound led to the idea of digitally
recording sound - - a process that is very similar to digital recording of
video images.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#106:1>
Sony of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands jointly developed a
product that produced high-fidelity sounds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#107:1>
The compact disc ( CD ) player was intended to be some kind of
ultimate experience for music bulls.

<P> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#108:1>
sound is recorded on CDs in a digital format rather than the
analogue format usually used in tapes and records.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#109:1>
To do this, alalogue sound is scanned ( or sampled ) , converted
into digital figures and then recorded in the CD.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#110:1>
( This means that the contents pf a CD can be interpreted as a
series of 1s and 0s. ) A laser beam pics up the signals, convers them into an
analogue format and plays them back. <3> Ithis process, noise, hiss and
other annoying effects are almost totally eliminated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#111:1>
Moreover, the microprocessor in the CD even rebuilds music lost due
to scrathes and dust on the disc.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#112:1>
The kind of data integrity offer by CD immediately drew the
attention of computer manufacturers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#113:1>
Soon, a version of the CD player which could be interfaced to
computer, because available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#114:1>
The vast amounts of data that can be stored on a silngle palm-sized
CD runs into hundreds of MBs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#115:1>
However, one major restriction is that the CD cannot record, because
of the nature of its design.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#116:1>
Hence CDs are ideal for storage of reference materials loke
dictionaries and databases.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-036#117:1>
But development did not stop there.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#118:1>
Researchers continued to look for ways erasable magnato-optical
discs make it possible to erase and rewrite on the disc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-036#119:1>
The tecnicque used, however, is partly magnetic and purely optical.
