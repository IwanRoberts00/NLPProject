<h> <bold> Celebrating the Essay </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#2:1>
by DARSHAN SINGH MAINI <&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#3:1>
<bold> The author recommends this collection of <quote> " some of the
most <*> dotted line</*> eloquent essays of our times" </quote> to the
<quote> " essay addict and the <}> <-> cognoscente </-> <+> cognoscenti </+>
</}> alike." </quote> </bold> </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#4:1>
<bold> Though </bold> the essay as a distinct literary genre has
been courted and coveted by some of the greatest writers of the English
language, it has never quite attained its rightful place in the community of
letters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#5:1>
While the poem, the novel, and the play walk into the parlor, or mount
the podium, as if it is their privilege, the essay is often treated as a poor
relation come in from the cold.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#6:1>
No wonder, it has <foreign> en route </foreign> sought hospitality
within the folds of the novel, the memoir, or the autobiography, and led a
fairly nomadic, shy, furtive, or vicarious existence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#7:1>
Of course, ever since Frenchman Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, who
is still regarded as the <w> essay's </w> putative father, the pure essayists
have struggled to keep its special credentials in order, wedded as they are
to a vision of the <w> genre's </w> freedom.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#8:1>
But for most novelists and poets, the essay has been a by-blow of
sorts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#9:1>
Ironically, for that very reason, it has attained a raffish charm.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#10:1>
Either way, it has managed to survive despite frequent notices
about its impending demise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#11:1>
For, if the essay is <quote> " an enactment of the creation of the
self," </quote> as O.B. Hardison argues in a recent defense of the embattled
genre, then it has a constitutive franchise, or an existential lease. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#12:1>
<it> Major Modern Essayists </it> <sp> * </sp> presents some of
the most impressive and eloquent essays of our times.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#13:1>
Although meant chiefly for the American college student, <O> <*>
line</*> </O> the <w> collection's </w> appeal extends to the essay addict
and the cognoscente alike.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#14:1>
It is truly a beaufiful house of words, assembled block by block,
and furnished with delicate care, taste, and understanding. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#15:1>
In his preface Professor Gilbert H. Muller, the <w> volume's </w>
editor, has set down the parameters of the exercise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#16:1>
The collection reveals a distinctive aesthetic at work in relation
to the format and the economy of the enterprise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#17:1>
It confines itself to 20th-century writers - - from Virginia Woolf
to Annie Dillard - - and offers a rich, varied, and generous fare - - <quote> "
a variety of voices, rhetorical modes, and prose forms." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#18:1>
The essays included in this volume come from such diverse areas
of study as history, art, literature, ecology, science, medicine, philosophy,
linguistics, and sports, thus encompassing almost the entire spectrum of
modern life, thought, and aesthetic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#19:1>
The 20 essayists - - ten men and ten women - - are drawn from Great
Britain, the United States, Canada, and Africa, and represent white,
black, Hispanic, and American-Chinese cultures.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#20:1>
Each is fielded with three to five pieces of prose to bring out the
aroma and ambience of his or her work.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#21:1>
A very thoughtful and efficient presentation but I was disappointed
to find no Indian writer here despite the fact that India produces the third
largest volume of literature in English in the world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#22:1>
Even more mystifying is the omission of other Commonwealth writers
such as V.S. Naipaul and George Lamming.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#23:1>
The kind of colonial experience they represent, and the kind of
English they have evolved to render the agony and irony of their
situation, cannot simply be found in other texts and contexts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#24:1>
In a critique of this size and nature, it is not possible to take
up each individual essayist, and bring out the virtues of his or her prose in
terms of thought, signature, and style.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#25:1>
Nor is there any room for adequate illustrations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#26:1>
The difficulty is compounded where some pieces and passages, like
period wines, yield their taste and flavor in slow, measured sips, and one
has to savor long periods of prose to register their presence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#27:1>
I propose, therefore, to touch on some known classics, and on a
couple of new American voices that have lifted prose to a level where it
pleases and charms, compels and holds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#28:1>
To set Virginia Woolf at the head of the table is to recall
appropriately her celebrated ( and much misunderstood) statement:
<quote> " Human nature changed in or about December 1910," </quote> which,
though formulated in the context of the Parisian Cubists and Surrealists,
defined strikingly a certain shift in modern sensibility, and in the ways of
appropriating experience for art.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#29:1>
The volume under review purports, above all, to show this aspect
through some of the profoundest moments of modern prose.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#30:1>
<w> Woolf's </w> essays included here- <quote> " Professions for
Women," </quote> <quote> " The Death of the Moth," </quote> and <quote> "
Middlebrow" </quote> - - illustrate the resilience of the domesticated gypsy
genre, for the essays in question are in the form of a public address, a
series of <quote> " dispersed meditations" </quote> ( <w> Bacon's </w>
definition of the essay), and a public letter in that order. <O> <&> page
</&> 37 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#31:1>
Her style accordingly is, in turn, chatty, witty, and conversational;
graphic, vivid, and figurative; puckish, fey, and mocking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#32:1>
Our next port of call is E.B. White, who almost created the
modern American essay out of the proven energies and felicities of the
American tongue.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#33:1>
<it> <mention> The New Yorker </mention> </it> style, which he
fashioned and honed into an instrument of precision, control, and dry wit,
subsuming conversational latencies, has become a modish American model for
high-profile magazine writing in English everywhere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#34:1>
As an essayist, White truly divined the purpose of the light essay as
an evocation of <quote> " the small things of the day, the trivial matters of
the heart." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#35:1>
<w> That's </w> where the essay and the short story come closest to
each other, for each deals, in essence, with <quote> " significant
insignificances," </quote> and each makes a song out of marginalities and
memorabilia, even as each seeks to convey some profound truths.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#36:1>
In his long and delightful essay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#37:1>
<quote> " The Ring of Time," </quote> in which White describes the
sheer magic of the circus, and the nostalgia of those visits, the reader is,
along with the writer, rolling, cavorting, freewheeling, and trapezing over
the artifacts of language: </p> <&> small type begin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#38:1>
The <w> rider's </w> gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed
to be circular <*> dotted line</*> then time itself began running in circles,
and so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same <*>
dotted line</*>.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#39:1>
Everything in her movements, her expression, told you that for her
the ring of time was perfectly formed, changeless, predictable, without
beginning or end, like the ring in which she was traveling at this moment
with the horse that wallowed under her.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#40:1>
And then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again-
time, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance
of a performer. </p> <&> small type end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#41:1>
For those who can overhear the echoes from T.S. Eliot and recall
the metaphor of the ring from 17th-century metaphysical poets, an essay of
this kind becomes a treat for the mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#42:1>
George Orwell, who was something of a secular visionary and the
conscience of a troubled race, is represented here by his much anthologized
essays such as <quote> " A Hanging," </quote> <quote> " Shooting an
Elephant," </quote> <quote> " Politics and the English Language," </quote>
<quote> " The Moon under Water," </quote> and <quote> " Why I Write."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#43:1>
These and several similar pieces have come to stay as classic
examples of plate glass and reflexive prose.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#44:1>
The main features of this prose are a controlled, nervious, and
efficient style, a freshness of idiom and metaphor, an organic development
of thought, a concreteness of detail, a precision of statement, and a strong
moral, Protestant vein.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#45:1>
And over the whole exercise presides a fine, subtle, and noble
imagination - - the imagination of <quote> " sincerity and authenticity."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#46:1>
In employing Lionel <w> Trilling's </w> terms <w> I'm </w>
reminded of the fact that the American <w> critic's </w> great admiration for
Orwell rested, among other things, upon the Orwellian <quote> " No, in
Thunder" </quote> to all shams and hypocrisies, and all cant and casuistry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#47:1>
No wonder, in <w> Orwell's </w> own words, <quote> " the imagination,
like certain wild animals, will not breed in captivity." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#48:1>
From Orwell to James Baldwin is only a leap from color and
continent to a similar sensibility, for despite their different
backgrounds, and situations and their worldview, each of them was
passionately and vigilantly devoted to the idea of truth as he saw it, and
to the search for a corresponding rhetoric and style.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#49:1>
And this is why each voice, in its own context, rings so truly, so
resonantly, and so movingly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#50:1>
<w> Baldwin's </w> prose is today widely recognized as a glorious
example of American writing marked by a sense of classical dignity and
vitality, and by a rhetoric of thunder, dream, and prophecy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#51:1>
The underlying grid of this rhetoric is fed continually by four
distinct, though converging, lines of energy - - Shakespeare, the <it>
King James Bible </it> , Negro spirituals, and Harlem slang.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#52:1>
The themes of his essays include abused childhood and street terrors,
racial destiny and existential suffering, problems of identity and
alienation, and moral and linguistic imperialism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#53:1>
These themes, to be sure, are <O> <*> line</*> </O> common to nearly
all writers of the Harlem Renaissance, but in Baldwin the issues become
invested with a strange visionary force.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#54:1>
Baldwin, the novelist, is often a conscious <quote> " Jamesian"
</quote> in his prose, but Baldwin, the essayist, is more Orwellian in the
final analysis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#55:1>
From James Baldwin to Martin Luther King, Jr., black American
prose follows a path of spiritual and moral polemic which, in some hands,
rises to a great song of sorrow in clear Biblical accents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#56:1>
But before I come to King I wish to salute some other talents that
make up the matrix of this insightful anthology: Barbara Tuchman, for whom
history was a creative art, and the historian an artist in his own domain
( see page 39), Lewis Thomas, who writes on American science with such
precision, wit, and eloquence; Doris Lessing, whose African-colonial
background makes her a white crusader committed to human dignity and
heroism; Russell Baker, an American humorist of pure vintage whose
essay <quote> " The Flag" </quote> is a deliciious and delicate satire
reminiscent of Mark Twain; Richard Selzer, who in <quote> " The Pen and the
Scalpel" </quote> ( published in <mention> SPAN </mention> , July 1989)
brings a <w> surgeon's </w> experience to bear upon the craft of writing;
Edward Hoagland, who talks of the essay as a wild thing out of the jungle
whose surface <quote> " generates sparks, like a cat of fur" </quote> ; Joan
Didion, who in the opinion of James Dickey is <quote> " the finest woman
prose stylist writing in the English language today" </quote> ; Joyce Carol
Oates, who is emerging as <w> America's </w> voice of culture and keeper of
conscience; Alice Walker, who at her best represents black feminine aesthetic
in America in an idiom of great power; and Annie Dillard, whose essays rise
above the din and dust of the native scene to claim her American heritage of
respect for life, and for its evocation of the beautiful, the sacred, and the
heroic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#57:1>
And, so finally, I come to King- <quote> " every inch a king"
</quote> of poetry and pathos.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#58:1>
His living classic, <quote> " I Have a Dream," </quote> is
presented as an example of American prose on the peaks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#59:1>
A most moving and powerful piece, it was written as much out of
the solar plexus as out of a politico-religious vision of austere beauty and
elegance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#60:1>
Its <O> <&> page </&> 38 </O> repetitive spoken pattern, its
haunting, evangelical rhythm, its urgency and eloquence, its visionary and
striking new phrases, among many of its other virtues, help make a prose
style that comes closest to being a <it> <foreign> stilus </foreign> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#61:1>
The Greek word indicates the lapidary aspect of such a prose, for
King uses his rhetoric as an instrument to cut the stones of experience to
proper proportions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#62:1>
Even more powerful in some ways is his long and great <quote> "
Letter from Birmingham City Jail" </quote> to the ever-pliable elders and
betters of his church. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-001#63:1>
To conclude, the <w> essay's </w> natural gaiety and inner
economy account for its undiminished vitality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#64:1>
As the French word, <it> <foreign> essai </foreign> </it> , the Latin
<it> <foreign> exagium </foreign> </it> , and the English <it> essay </it>
suggest, it is a genre that continually solicits effort and exertions and
strivings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#65:1>
To try, to test, to dart forth, to light out - - that, in sum,
constitutes its being and becoming.

<ICE-IND:W2B-001#66:1>
The essay, then, is linked to the imagination on the prowl, turning
over any small object, place, or person that may, with luck, yield a
measure of music. </p> <*> small square</*> <&> footnote on page 37,
