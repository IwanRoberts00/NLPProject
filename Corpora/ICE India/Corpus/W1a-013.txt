<I> <O> Q. 1 b) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#1:1>
<h> <ul> The Grapvine communication </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#2:1>
Grapevine communication means <mention> a vine on which Grapes are
grown </mention> similarly it is a line on which communication flows.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#3:1>
It is also known as <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> secret
communication.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#4:1>
Both the meanings can be applied to it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#5:1>
Grapevine communication it <+> means </+> an unofficial,
informal and unorganised form of communication which helps to spread the
message quickly among the workers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#6:1>
It spreads in any direction like that of a vine of grape.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#7:1>
As it is <del> a </del> informal communication it spreads in any
direction and carries message that is partially true, fully true or
completely false. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#8:1>
Grapevine communication is harmful as well as useful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#9:1>
It is harmful when it carries wrong information and so <}> <-> an </->
<+> a </+> </}> good management always keeps an eye of the flow of
communication through the Grapvine. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#10:1>
Grapevine is useful in 2 ways

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#11:1>
1) It is an indicator or <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> barometer of
the morale of the workers and <}> <-> In </-> <+> in </+> </}> the event if
the morale is poor, measures can be taken to raise it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#12:1>
2) It is like a vent, exit and outflow of the tension and worries of
the workers which has an effect on the work performance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#13:1>
So grapevine <}> <-> reliefs </-> <+> relieves </+> </}> the workers
of their tension and worries. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#14:1>
<h> The Technique of Using Grapevine </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#15:1>
This type of communication is useful to send some <del> sort
</del> types of information.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#16:1>
The officer calls the individual into his cabin and while talking
about other matters reveals the information that <del> has been </del> he
wants to pass on.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#17:1>
He makes it a point to tell the person that he is the most reliable
person in the organisation and <}> <-> request </-> <+> requests </+> </}>
him to keep the message <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> secret.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#18:1>
But when the person goes out of the <w> officer's </w> cabin he has
an urge to tell the others especially his <quote> ` Best Friend' </quote>
and so he tell him, his best friend tells the other person.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#19:1>
Thus, the message <del> is no </del> which is considered to be a
secret is no longer a secret. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#20:1>
The Grapevine can carry only a few type of informations like

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#21:1>
1) It can carry on fresh message

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#22:1>
2) People like to talk about other people as human beings are the
most interesting topic for discussion

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#23:1>
3) The staff usually <}> <-> talks </-> <+> talk </+> </}> about
fashion, films, leave, Bonus, promotion etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#24:1>
The Grapevine is also helpful to spread important information but
it should be regu<del>r</del>larly checked.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#25:1>
If it carries any false information <}> <-> than </-> <+> then </+>
</}> the management can <}> <-> counter check </-> <+> countercheck </+> </}>
it by passing the correct information through formal medium of communication
like circulars, notices etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#26:1>
But sometimes it is found that it is not useful and so the management
can use the same medium that is the Grapevine to spread the correct and true
information.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#27:1>
Grapevine is also useful to check the morale of the workers and
<del> any </del> any false message in the Grapevine is necessarily to be
counterchecked. </p> </I>


<I> <O> d) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#28:2>
<h> <ul> Socio-psychological barriers </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#29:2>
The<del>i</del> main objective of communication is that <}> <->
is </-> <+> it </+> </}> should be received completely received by the other
person so we make a number of <}> <-> preparation </-> <+> preparations </+>
</}> but still we find that something goes wrong and the message is partly
received or partially received and sometimes misunderstood.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#30:2>
This is because of the number of barriers which interfere in the
smooth flow of communication.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#31:2>
It is necessary to find these barriers and overcome them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#32:2>
The different types of barriers are : <&> serial numbers 1 to 3
are at the left of margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#33:2>
1) Physical Barrier

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#34:2>
2) Language Barrier

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#35:2>
3) Socio-psychological Barrier </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#36:2>
The third type of barrier that is <mention> the
socio-psychological Barrier </mention> come into <}> <-> existance </-> <+>
existence </+> </}> because of the nature, mood, habits, personality and
emotions of the human beings.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#37:2>
These factors from both the sides that is from the <}> <-> receivers
</-> <+> <w> receiver's </w> </+> </}> side as well as from the <}> <->
senders </-> <+> <w> sender's </w> </+> </}> side destroy, <-> destruct </->
and disturb the communication.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#38:2>
The sender sends the message <}> <-> accoring </-> <+> according </+>
</}> to his idea and understanding and the receiver receives the message
according to his feelings, moods and his understanding and they both differ
because two human <}> <-> being </-> <+> beings </+> </}> are never alike.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#39:2>
Two types of important socio-psychological barriers are :

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#40:2>
1) <h> <ul> Closed Mind </ul> - - </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#41:2>
<mention> Closed Mind </mention> is an important type of
socio-psychological barrier and it is mostly seen in an organisation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#42:2>
<del> The </del> Many a times the superiors in the organisation
consider themselves to be superior to the others in understanding and
knowledge he thinks that whatever he knows is enough and right and he is not
ready to listen to others or understand others or accept new ideas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#43:2>
This mainly causes a problem to the new entrants in the organisation
who are young and fresh and they have their own ideas which are modern and
scientific.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#44:2>
But due to the closed mind of the <}> <-> superior </-> <+> superiors
</+> </}> they are never given a chance to express themselves.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#45:2>
It is found that closed mindedness exists because of some deep rooted
fear or prejudice and therefore it is necessary to detect the cause for this
closed-mind and act accordingly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#46:2>
2) <h> <ul> Status Barrier </ul> - - </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#47:2>
This Status Barrier also exists in the organisation due to the
difference in the post.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#48:2>
There are Groups of Superiors and <}> <-> sub-ordinates. </-> <+>
subordinates. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#49:2>
The superiors are ranked higher and so they kind of dominate over the
<}> <-> sub-ordinates. </-> <+> subordinates. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#50:2>
Sometimes the <}> <-> sub-ordinates </-> <+> subordinates </+>
</}> change their <}> <-> opi<del>o</del>nian </-> <+> opinion </+> </}> on
certain matters in order to please their superiors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#51:2>
The <}> <-> sub-ordinates </-> <+> subordinates </+> </}> are
usually <del> affa </del> afraid of the superiors and do not take their
problems and <}> <-> grevinces </-> <+> grievances </+> </}> to them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#52:2>
Thus this status barrier can be removed by encouraging upward
communication - - <}> <-> The </-> <+> the </+> </}> different ways of
removing the status barriers are : <&> serial numbers 1 to 6 are left to
margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#53:2>
1) Encouraging Two-way communication

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#54:2>
2) The superiors should have an openmind on matters

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#55:2>
3) Get-togethers like picnic, parties, sports activities <}> <->
together </-> <+> etc., </+> </}> should be encouraged.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#56:2>
4) The superiors should know the <del> suob</del> <}> <->
sub-ordinate </-> <+> subordinates </+> </}> at an informal level.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#57:2>
5) <del> They show</del> The superiors should encourage the <}> <->
sub-ordinates </-> <+> subordinates </+> </}> to give suggestions on
different matters and participate in meetings.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#58:2>
6) The special formalities and services should be eliminated like
air-condition facilities etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#59:2>
This Rank difference cannot be abolished all together but can
be removed to some extent by using the above mentioned methods. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.2 a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#60:3>
Louis Allen defines communication as <mention> <}> <-> an </->
<+> a </+> </}> bridge of meaning </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#61:3>
It involves a systamatic and continuous process of telling,
understanding and listening.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#62:3>
Thus communication is a two way process and <mention> listening
</mention> is the other half of communication.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#63:3>
<mention> Listening </mention> is done with the mind and therefore it
is an active process, it involves the eyes, the ears, and mind.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#64:3>
<mention> Listening </mention> is something different <}> <-> then
</-> <+> from </+> </}> <mention> hearing </mention> ; it involves both
<mention> hearing </mention> and <mention> thinking </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#65:3>
It is said that a good listener is a good communicator.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#66:3>
If people stop listening there is no use of talking. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#67:3>
<h> <ul> The obstacles to listening </ul> : - </h> <&> serial numbers
1 to 8 are on left margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#68:3>
1) <ul> Physical </ul> : -

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#69:3>
It is seen that the listener is always disturbed by physical
barriers like noise and sometimes even by the <}> <-> speakers </-> <+> <w>
speaker's </w> </+> </}> appearance and gestures </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#70:3>
2) <ul> Language </ul> : -

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#71:3>
It is found that sometimes the language that the speaker speaks
<-> it </-> is not understood by the listener.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#72:3>
But sometimes listening is obstructed because of the language use.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#73:3>
The speaker may be too high and sometimes due to the faulty
pronunciation and accent of the speaker. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#74:3>
3) It is observed the <del> the </del> mind of the listener works
faster than the tongue of the speaker and so there is a space or gap between
the speech and reception<+>.</+> <}> <-> during </-> <+> During </+> </}>
this time the listener starts day dreaming yawning as a result of which
listening is affected. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#75:3>
<h> <ul> 4) Pre<del>f</del>-convinced ideas </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#76:3>
Sometimes the listeners have pre-convinced ideas that the subject
or the speaker is boring and so he does not make an attempt to listen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#77:3>
5) Sometimes the listener finds it difficult to understand and he
sometimes listens only to the things which he wants to <del> listern </del>
listen <}> <-> accoring </-> <+> according </+> </}> to his needs, beliefs,
ideas etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#78:3>
Over stimulation or over excitement also reduces the <w>
listener's </w> listening capacity as the process becomes slower and so the
listening is greatly affected. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#79:3>
<h> <ul> 6) Pre-occupied mind </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#80:3>
It is often observed the mind of the listener is mostly occupied
in other thoughts that he thinks about other things and not the <del> topic
</del> ideas of the topic under discussion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#81:3>
7) Sometimes the listener listens with his eyes closed and so he
listens only to the voice and words and not the feelings, ideas and
expressions behind them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#82:3>
8) Sometimes the listener is rather busy in pretending to listen
rather than listening due to which listening does not go on well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#83:3>
Sometimes the listening is affected because the listener is mentally
or physically tired. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#84:3>
<h> <ul> Ways to remove obstacles </ul> </h> <&> serial nubers 1 to 6
are on the left margin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#85:3>
1) Try not be be <}> <-> disturb </-> <+> disturbed </+> </}> and
distracted by the appearance and gestures of the speaker

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#86:3>
2) The time that is got between the process of speaking and listening
utilise it in a better way to think of the subject in depth and not waste it
in day-dreaming.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#87:3>
3) Do not <}> <-> prejudice </-> <+> be prejudiced, </+> </}> give a
fair chance to the speaker to express his views and <}> <-> opionion </-> <+>
opinions. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#88:3>
<}> <-> 3) </-> <+> 4) </+> </}> Do not think of other things when
<del> then </del> you are listening and do not listen with your eyes closed
because we may miss out the ideas and expressions behind that.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#89:3>
<}> <-> 4) </-> <+> 5) </+> </}> Do not have pre-<del>conciev</del>
<}> <-> concveid </- > <+> conceived </+> </}> ideas because no person or
subject can be boring in the world and therefore try to listen properly and
develop an interest.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#90:3>
<}> <-> 5) </-> <+> 6) </+> </}> Listen to the entire speech <del> do
</del> if you do not understand something do not <}> <-> interup </-> <+>
interrupt </+> </}> the speaker by the end of the speech you will have
answers to all the questions and if not ask him at the end.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#91:3>
<}> <-> 6) </-> <+> 7) </+> </}> Listen with <}> <-> empamy </-> <+>
empathy </+> </}> rather than apathy. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#92:4>
<h> <ul> The Block form of Letter </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#93:4>
Today the world business is growing at a rapid rate<+>.</+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#94:4>
<}> <-> people </-> <+> People </+> </}> do not have time for each
other and so in this rapidly advancing world <+> it </+> is necessary to keep
contacts <del> in </del> with others.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#95:4>
Today most of <+> us </+> are <+> in </+> contact with other
people<del>s</del> <-> are </-> through letters and thererfore letters play
<}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> very important role in <}> <-> are </-> <+>
our </+> </}> day to day social and business activities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#96:4>
There are letters written in different form<+>.</+> <}> <-> they </->
<+> They </+> </}> are : <&> serial numbers 1 to 6 left on margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#97:4>
1) The Indented Form

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#98:4>
2) The Semi-block Form

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#99:4>
3) The Block Form

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#100:4>
4) The Fomplete Block Form

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#101:4>
5) The Hanging Indented Form

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#102:4>
6) The N.O.M.A forma </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#103:4>
Out of these, Block Form is the one which is usually used in the
modern business houses as it is <+> not </+> time consuming and looks
effecient and effective.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#104:4>
In case of the Block form of the letter <del> writte </del> writing
<mention> the Date, Signature and Complimentary Close </mention> as usual are
written on the left hand side.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#105:4>
The three to four spaces below the date on the left hand side the
<mention> Inside Address </mention> is written.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#106:4>
In case of the indented form on the first line of <mention> the
inside address </mention> is written <del> ne </del> near the margin and the
remaining lines are written in the indented form.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#107:4>
But in the block form the first line of <mention> the inside address
</mention> is written near the margin and so also the remaining lines are
written close to the margin<+>.</+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#108:4>
<}> <-> there </-> <+> There </+> </}> is no indention and address
is written with open <}> <-> puncuation </-> <+> puntuation </+> </}> that
is the comma sign is not put <}> <-> behing </-> <+> behind </+> </}> every
line that of the <del> Bt </del> indented form.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#109:4>
Three to four spaces below <mention> the <}> <-> inside </-> <+>
Inside </+> </}> Address, the Salutation </mention> is written which usually
begins from close to the margin.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#110:4>
Then comes the <}> <-> Body </-> <+> body </+> </}> of the letter
which is written in <mention> the block form </mention> that is the starting
line of each paragraph is written close to the margin without indention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#111:4>
This is one of the time saving faster medium of <}> <-> writting
</-> <+> writing </+> </}> the letters and is therefore adopted by most of
the business houses. </p> </I>


<I> <O> a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#112:5>
<h> <ul> Conciseness in a Business Letter </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#113:5>
A Business letter is very important and essential and its
writing is also <del> although </del> very essential.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#114:5>
The <}> <-> Business </-> <+> business </+> </}> letter is <}> <->
indispensible </-> <+> indispensable </+> </}> as it represents you.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#115:5>
<del> instead </del> The <}> <-> Business </-> <+> business </+>
</}> letter is <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> legal document, it is useful
for reference, it should have the persuasive function and it helps in
increasing the goodwill of the organisation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#116:5>
Language of the Business letter is a formal language and
therefore vague <}> <-> indefinate </-> <+> definite </+> </}> words
should not be used.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#117:5>
Therefore a Business letter should be planned properly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#118:5>
For writing of the business letter there are rules : they are four
words begining with <mention> C </mention> that guides the person in writing
of the business letter they are :

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#119:5>
1) Correctness

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#120:5>
2) Completeness

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#121:5>
3) Clarity

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#122:5>
4) Conciseness </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#123:5>
<mention> Conciseness </mention> is very important in a business
letter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#124:5>
Conciseness means to the point or making the letter brief.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#125:5>
To observe conciseness in a business letter we should keep in mind
that <+> we </+> use a) Short words b) Short sentences c) familiar words
d) correct words and exclude abstract words open to interpretation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#126:5>
The <-> words and the </-> language should be simple for that not
only <+> for </+> <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> educated man <+> to </+>
understand<del>s</del> it but also <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+> </}> less
educated man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#127:5>
It should be always noted that a Business letter is <+> to </+> use
to <quote> " Express" </quote> and not to <quote> " Impress" </quote> and
therefore use of long sentimental sentences, phrases etc<+>.,</+> should be
avoided.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#128:5>
The language should be easy and <+> the </+> use of unfamiliar words
should be avoided like <mention> subsequent - - next ter<del>i</del>minate -
- stop </mention> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#129:5>
To make the letter concise active voice should be used as in the
active voice sentences are shorter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#130:5>
New topics should begin in a new paragraph and there should be a
proper link between the two <}> <-> paragraph </-> <+> paragraphs </+> </}>
and to do this<del>s</del> proper words like <mention> Although, However,
</mention> <del> on insp </del> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#131:5>
We should avoid the use of <}> <-> redandent </-> <+> redundant </+>
</}> phrases like <mention> Reply to us by <}> <-> eary </-> <+> early </+>
</}> </mention> <del> possible </del> <mention> post as early as possible
</mention> here <mention> early as possible </mention> is not necessary,
<mention> let us <}> <-> coperate togethar </-> <+> cooperate together; </+>
</}> </mention> here <mention> <}> <-> togethar </-> <+> together </+> </}>
</mention> is not important. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-013#132:5>
But <}> <-> inorder </-> <+> in order </+> </}> to make the
letter <mention> concise </mention> we should not omit important points in
the letter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#133:5>
In case if the letter is too long, a brief <}> <-> cover </-> <+>
covering </+> </}> <-> up of the </-> letter can be made and posted along
with the letter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-013#134:5>
For eg. The Bio-data along with a job-application. </p> </I>
