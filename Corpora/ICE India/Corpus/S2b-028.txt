<&> Music </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#2:1:A>
<mention> Music </mention> <,,> this is the most essential factor in  
the very existence of man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#3:1:A>
But <,> what is music <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#4:1:A>
Dictionary defines <mention> music </mention> <,,> as the art of  
expression in sound <,,> in harmony <,> and melody <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#5:1:A>
So music is not mere noise <,,> it is a series of melodious and  
harmonious sounds <,> very pleasing to the ear <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#6:1:A>
So <,,> melodious and harmonious sounds <,> very pleasing to the ear  
<,> make music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#7:1:A>
These melodious sounds also have rhythm in it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#8:1:A>
Music must have been born <,> even before the language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#9:1:A>
When man came into being on this earth <,> he must have heard many  
melodious sounds around him <,,> <mention> The rippling sound of water <,,>  
waves of sea <,,> chirping of birds <,,> rustling of leaves </mention> <,,>  
all these sweet sounds <,,> probably gave him the knowledge of musical note  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#10:1:A>
He must have later on given names to these musical notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#11:1:A>
Every human being is born <,,> with an ear for music <,,> and loves  
to sing <&> singing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#12:1:A>
Little children <,,> illiterate adivasis <,,> village women <,> and  
all those who sing <,> but have never made a proper study of music <,> are  
hardly aware <,> that the sweet melodious sounds that they are producing <,>  
are composed of seven musical notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#13:1:A>
Folk songs <,,> devotional songs <,,> film music <,,> gazal <,>  
thumri <,> classical music <,> even western music <,,> all these different  
types of music <,> are composed <,> of seven basic musical notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#14:1:A>
Call them <,,> <mention> do re mi pha so la ti </mention> <,,> or  
<mention> sa re ga ma pa dha ni </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#15:1:A>
Whether it is Eastern music <,> or Western music <,,> these seven  
musical notes <,> are universally accepted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#16:1:A>
After the completion of these seven notes <,> the second octave  
begins <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#17:1:A>
Let us talk about Indian music <,,> <mention> sa <,> re <,> ga <,>  
ma <,> pa <,> dha <,> ni </mention> <,,> are basic seven notes <,,> called  
<indig> shudha swaras </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#18:1:A>
There are five more notes <,> in between these basic notes <,>  
called <indig> komal </indig> and <indig> tivra </indig> notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#19:1:A>
Thus <,> all music <,> has these twelve basic notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#20:1:A>
Let us take an example <,,> of a very popular <,,> but very simple  
<indig> bhajan </indig> that every Indian can sing <,> <indig> Raghupati  
Raghav Rajaram </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#21:1:A>
How many of us know <,> of what musical notes <,> this simple  
<indig> bhajan </indig> is composed of <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#22:1:A>
Let us see <,> <&> bhajan </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#23:1:A>
Let us hear the same tune <,> now on guitar <,> <&> guitar being  
played </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#24:1:A>
The same musical notes <,,> are either vocally produced <,> or they  
are played on the instrument <,> to produce the same tune <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#25:1:A>
It is indeed very interesting <,> to know who created these musical  
notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#26:1:A>
About the origin of music <,> and the seven musical notes <,> there  
are many stories <,> all different stories <,> in different countries <,>  
different languages <,> and different religion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#27:1:A>
Hindus believe <,,> that Brahmadeva created music <,,> gave this  
art to Shankar <,> who handed it over to Saraswati <,> who is considered <,,>  
as the goddess of fine arts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#28:1:A>
Later <,> Narad did penance <,> or <indig> tapascharya </indig> and  
received the art of music from Saraswati <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#29:1:A>
Narad then taught music <,> to Gandharvas <,> Kinnaras and Apsaras  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#30:1:A>
Bharatmuni <,> the great sage <,> is responsible for bringing music  
on this earth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#31:1:A>
Even in the oldest of scriptures <,> we find the mention of music  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#32:1:A>
According to one European story <,,> this world was originally  
created without music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#33:1:A>
This world <,> was dry <,,> drab and very uninteresting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#34:1:A>
Man and woman <,> were unhappy <,> and could not make love in this  
atmosphere <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#35:1:A>
So God created <,> seven beautiful melodious musical notes <,> to  
make this world <,,> enchanting and lovable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#36:1:A>
In Arabian history <,> it is believed <,> that music originated <,>  
from the bird <mention> bulbul </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#37:1:A>
According to the African sage Ifari <,,> man and woman <,> were  
bathing in a beautiful lake <,,> and their movements in the water <,> created  
lovely sweet sounds <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#38:1:A>
These melodious sounds created in the water <,> are the origin of  
music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#39:1:A>
Well known musicologist Rinsobols <,,> also believed <,> that  
musical notes <,> have originated <,,> from melodious sounds <,> created in  
the ripples of water <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#40:1:A>
The Japanese scholar <,> Shikoba <,> says in his book <,> that  
music <,> <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> originated in heaven <,> not on  
this earth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#41:1:A>
When man and woman were created by the god <,> they already had the  
knowledge of music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#42:1:A>
So music is always considered <,> to be divine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#43:1:A>
The Western scholar Freud <,,> always believed <,,> that origin of  
music <,> has its base <,> in the psychology of human being <,,> <&> sounds  
</&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#44:1:A>
The sounds uttered by the child <,,> <&> sounds </&> <mention>  
crying <,> laughing <,> shouting </mention> <,,> are learnt by the child  
itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#45:1:A>
Nobody teaches the child to cry <,> or to laugh <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#46:1:A>
Similarly <,> the musical notes are created by the man himself <,>  
when he was feeling happy and relaxed <,> <&> sound </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#47:1:A>
Another Western historian says <,,> that man has created music <,>  
through his wisdom <,> and intelligence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#48:1:A>
Man has always been searching <,> different ways <,> to entice the  
woman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#49:1:A>
So <,> he has tried to attract her <,> by creating <,> different  
sweet melodious sounds <,> and thus <,> music came into being <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#50:1:A>
Well known Indian scholar Damodar Pandit says <,,> that the seven  
notes of music <,> are created <,> by imitating the sounds of different birds  
and animals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#51:1:A>
The basic note <mention> sa </mention> <,> is taken from peacock  
<,> <mention> re </mention> <,> from chatak <,> <mention> ga </mention> from  
sheep <,> <mention> ma </mention> <,> from kraunch or crane <,,> <mention> pa  
</mention> <,> from <indig> koel </indig> <,> <mention> dha </mention> <,,>  
from frog <,,> and <mention> ni </mention> <,> from elephant <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#52:1:A>
It is also believed <,,> that as seven colours are emitted by  
sunlight <,,> so the seven musical notes <,> are emitted from <mention> Om  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#53:1:A>
<mention> Om </mention> is one letter word <,> containing three  
letters <,> <mention> a <,> oo </mention> <,> and <mention> ma </mention>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#54:1:A>
These three letters <,> symbolise energy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#55:1:A>
<mention> A </mention> symbolises creation <,> or creator Brahma  
<,,> <mention> Oo </mention> symbolises <,> protector Vishnu <,,> and  
<mention> Ma </mention> symbolises <,> destroyer Mahesh <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#56:1:A>
All these three energies together <,> form the trinity <,> or  
Trimurti Parameshwar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#57:1:A>
The basic original sound <,> used in Vedas is <mention> Om  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#58:1:A>
The vibration <,> produced by the correct utterance of this word  
<mention> Om </mention> <,> are very very powerful <,> and the correct  
utterance of <mention> Om </mention> <,> can awaken the latent energy of the  
man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#59:1:A>
The seven musical notes <,> emanate from this one letter word  
<mention> Om </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#60:1:A>
And <,> the correct utterance <,> and repeatedly utterance of  
<mention> Om </mention> and the pursuit of <mention> Om </mention> <,> can  
give the enlightenment of music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#61:1:A>
In Indian music <,> the seven musical notes are called <,,> <indig>  
Shadaja <,> rishabha <,> gandhar <,> madhyam <,> pancham <,> dhaivat <,> and  
nishad </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#62:1:A>
Who gave these names <,> to these seven musical notes is really a  
mystery <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#63:1:A>
<indig> Shadaja </indig> means <,> creator of six notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#64:1:A>
The vocal singer <,,> fixes <,> his basic note <mention> sa  
</mention> <,> according to the capacity of his vocal cords <,> and from this  
basic <mention> sa </mention> <,> he gives the ascent in ascending order <,>  
the next six notes <,> <mention> re <,> ga <,> ma <,> pa <,> dha </mention>  
and <mention> ni </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#65:1:A>
Before fixing the position of the seven notes <,,> one believed in  
twenty-two <indig> shrutis </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#66:1:A>
Sounds <,> useful to create music <,> were first called <indig>  
shrutis </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#67:1:A>
From the twenty-two <indig> shrutis </indig> in one octave <,,>  
seven were chosen <,> and names were given to them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#68:1:A>
<indig> Shadaja <,> madhyam </indig> and <indig> pancham </indig>  
<,> have four <indig> shrutis </indig> each <,,> <indig> nishad <,> gandhar  
</indig> have two <indig> shrutis </indig> each <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#69:1:A>
<indig> Rishabha </indig> and <indig> dhaivata </indig> <,> have  
three <indig> shrutis </indig> each <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#70:1:A>
During the vedic period <,,> only three musical notes were used  
<,,> they were called <,,> <indig> udaatta <,> anudaatta </indig> and <indig>  
swaritta </indig> <,> or <indig> prathama <,> dwitiya </indig> and <indig>  
tritiya </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#71:1:A>
They were equivalent <,> to <indig> gandhara <,> rishabha </indig>  
and <indig> shadaja </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#72:1:A>
A little later <,> one more note <,> a little higher than these  
notes <,> was used while chanting the Vedas <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#73:1:A>
It was equivalent <,> to <indig> madhyam </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#74:1:A>
Later on <,> three more notes <,> equivalent to <indig> pancham <,>  
dhaivata </indig> and <indig> nishad </indig> were added <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#75:1:A>
During <w> Panini's </w> time <,,> these seven <indig> shudhha  
</indig> musical notes <,> were already accepted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#76:1:A>
Later on five more notes were added <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#77:1:A>
They were in between these seven notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#78:1:A>
No new names were given to them <,,> but they were called <,>  
<indig> re komal <,> ga komal <,> ma tivra <,> dha komal </indig> and <indig>  
ni komal </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#79:1:A>
Thus <,,> these twelve music notes <,> were accepted <,> and all  
music is composed of these twelve musical notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#80:1:A>
They are little lower <,> or little higher than the <indig> shuddha  
</indig> notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#81:1:A>
So today <,> we have these twelve basic musical notes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#82:1:A>
Music is normally composed of three octaves <,,> each containing  
twenty-two <indig> shrutis </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#83:1:A>
The middle octave is called <indig> madhya saptak </indig> <,,> the  
lower octave is called <indig> mandra saptak </indig> <,> and the higher  
octave is called <indig> tivra saptak </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#84:1:A>
Different permutations and combinations of these musical notes <,>  
produce different moods <,> different <indig> ragas </indig> <,> different  
music <,> all very pleasing to the ear <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#85:1:A>
Musical notes <,> are like flowers in a garden <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#86:1:A>
Each flower has a different colour <,> different aroma <,>  
different beauty <,> and different splendour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#87:1:A>
Each flower is beautiful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#88:1:A>
One can choose different flowers from this garden of musical notes  
<,> and form thousands of varieties of beautiful bouquets <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-028#89:1:A>
This music bestows upon the human mind <,> the heavenly bliss <,>  
and creates a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere <,,> for which the human  
being strives <&> music </&> </I>
