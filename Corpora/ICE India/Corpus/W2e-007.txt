<h> <bold> Continuing Scandal </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#2:1>
The parliamentary debate on what opposition parties have called
the <quote> " sugar scandal" </quote> has been neither illuminative nor
purposeful.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#3:1>
While the opposition members levelled allegations without doing much
homework, the Union minister of state for food, Mr Kalpanath Rai, offered an
untenable defence of his inept performance, or deliberate manipulation, as
some would say, passing the buck to his officials.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#4:1>
If it was really the <w> official's </w> fault, Parliament should have
been informed what action has been taken against them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#5:1>
If not, it is patently unfair to blame them when government rules do
not permit civil servants to defend themselves in public.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#6:1>
It is also unfortunate that the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao,
should have chosen to keep quiet when a member of his council of ministers
was unabashedly passing the blame on to the officials.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#7:1>
The fact of the matter is that the steep increase in sugar prices is
partly the result of ineptitude in management, for which Mr Rai, the
officials of his ministry and the officials of other ministries and
government agencies, like the State Trading Corporation and the Minerals and
Metals Trading Corporation, are all equally responsible.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#8:1>
The crisis is not, however, just the result of poor management.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#9:1>
It has also been caused by deliberate manipulation of monthly
releases, delayed imports and the complex licence-quota system which still
operates in the sugar mill industry.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#10:1>
Hence, the opposition charge that the <quote> " crisis" </quote> is a
<quote> " scandal" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#11:1>
In this respect, Mr Rai has more to explain than what he has cared to
do so far. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#12:1>
This is not the first time, however, that the potent combination
of sugar and politics has embarassed a government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#13:1>
It will not be the last either, unless sugar is decontrolled like all
other major consumer goods.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#14:1>
Indeed, there is no reason why the licensing and production and
distribution controls should continue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#15:1>
Instead, a buffer stock must be maintained to regulate the impact of
output fluctuations on price.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#16:1>
Any concern about the rising sugar prices does not mean that sugar is
an essential commodity.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#17:1>
But the point is that consumers have been put to hardship needlessly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#18:1>
The recent spurt in prices has to be adequately probed and those
guilty punished.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#19:1>
Otherwise, the public perception of a scandal involving mainly
politicians will persist and even gain in strength.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#20:1>
Even at this late stage the government can act to push sugar prices
down by increasing the levy quota, forcing mills to part with more sugar for
the public distribution system and allowing them to sell imported sugar at
market-determined prices without any ceiling on the free market price.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#21:1>
Simultaneously, the government will also have to ensure that all
those who have LPG connections are denied access to rationed sugar.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#22:1>
The rationalisation of the PDS can begin with sugar and
cross-subsidisation will save the exchequer the burden of a higher food
subsidy. </p> <*> a dark line in the middle </*>

<h> <bold> Toward European Unity </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#24:1>
The results of last <w> week's </w> elections to the European
Parliament confirm two trends: apathy towards the European Union and
disillusionment with national governments.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#25:1>
As during the voting on the Maastricht treaty, the electorate turned
the elections into a referendum on the ruling parties.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#26:1>
The biggest losers were the Conservatives in Britain, where Mr John
Major is facing a crisis of confidence, and the Socialists in Spain, where Mr
Felipe Gonzalez was made to pay the price for rising unemployment and a spate
of political scandals.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#27:1>
The fact that the winners in these two countries were from opposite
ends of the political spectrum - - Labour in Britain and the right-wing
Popular Party in Spain - - shows that voters were more concerned with
censuring their governments than with the cohesiveness of the European Union.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#28:1>
A notable exception to the trend was Germany, where the surprisingly
strong showing by Chancellor Helmut <w> Kohl's </w> ruling centre-right
Christian Democrats will boost their chances in the national elections
later this year.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#29:1>
Similarly, Mr Silvio <w> Berlusconi's </w> fledgling conservative
government won a powerful vote of support in Italy, although the poor voter
turn-out signalled that recession and the recent political upheavals have
dampened the <w> Italians' </w> traditional ardour for a federal Europe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#30:1>
Although extreme right-wingers faced badly in Germany and Itali,
their gains in France and Belgium show that their anti-Europe and
anti-foreign agenda still has some support.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#31:1>
On balance, however, the results have favoured the mainstream
political parties, providing fresh impetus to the European Union which is
trying to forge a common foreign policy and introduce a single currency by
1999.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#32:1>
In fact, the elections mark a significant stage in the transition of
the European Union to a more inclusive post-cold War entity, with opening of
its doors to the contries of the north and west along with closer links with
the east.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#33:1>
Nevertheless, the continuing gulf netween Euro-sceptics and
Euro-enthusiasts suggests that individual governments have failed to gain
public endorsement for their ideal to the extent they desire.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#34:1>
The proposals for a <quote> ` multi-speed' </quote> Europe are a
response to popular fears of the social and economic consequences of
unity. </p> <*> a dark line in the middle </*> <h> <bold> Dark Side of Disney
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#35:1>
It is a truism that every dream whispers, in suitably disguised
intonations, the <w> dreamer's </w> most compelling hopes and fears.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#36:1>
Only to a few dreamers, visionaries or madmen, however, does the
moment come when they can superimpose their fantasies on the terrors and
ambitions of their compatriots.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#37:1>
It is then that national myths are born.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#38:1>
One such was Walt Disney.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#39:1>
Through the technical wizardry and visual delight of his cartoon
films, he invited America to participate in his songs of innocence and
experience, to re-fashion itself in his wonderland.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#40:1>
If Disney was Peter Pan, the eternal youth, then so, by implication,
was America; if Disney was Pinocchio, the truant boy who discovered
himself in the proecss of running away, or Snow White, who emerged triumphant
through tribulation, then these were also archetypal narratives of <w>
America's </w> progress.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#41:1>
Disney played a crucial role in promoting the great white American
dream, pulling millions of viewers through the travails of the Great
Depression and World War II.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#42:1>
It has, however, long been known that the fairy tale pageant masked a
brooding darkness; that the magic of <w> Disney's </w> romances hid an
intransigent racist, an inconsiderate husband, an alcoholic who suffered from
chronic depression, a stern moralist who was plagued by the suspicion that he
had been the illegitimate child of a Spanish washer-woman.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#43:1>
In a recent biography, <it> Walt Disney: <w> Hollywood's </w> Dark
Prince </it> , Marc Eliot uncovers further damaging facts about the creator
of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#44:1>
It is saddening to learn, for instance, that Disney was, from 1940
till his death in 1967, an informer for the FBI, who monitored his
colleagues.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#45:1>
He was instrumental in letting Senator <w> McCarthy's </w> infamous
Un-American Activities Committee loose in Hollywood, one result of which
exercise was the exile of Charlie Chaplin.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#46:1>
This was ironic: <w> Chaplin's </w> tramps had been <w> Disney's </w>
first inspiration, and Mickey mouse had been conceived as a tribute to the
legendary comedian.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#47:1>
Indeed, it is tragic that in his disastrous demonstration of loyalty
to the nation, Disney betrayed and helped destroy the old Hollywood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#49:2>
Even as Sanjay <w> Dutt's </w> arrest has again focussed
attention on the inquiry into the Bombay blasts case, the feeling has
remained that the forthcoming trial of more than 190 people may be something
of an anti-climax.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#50:2>
The reason obviously is that the authorities have been unable to lay
their hands on any of the principal actors who have been held primarily
responsible for the outrage.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#51:2>
More than 20 of them, including the prime suspects Dawood Ibrahim and
Abdul Razak <quote> " Tiger" </quote> Memon, have been absconding for more
than a year, and the government has met with no success in persuading those
countries which are believed to be sheltering them to offer any kind of
co-operation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#52:2>
Indeed, there is no certainty as to where exactly these guilty men
are hiding.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#53:2>
In their absence, the court would be seen to be dealing with only the
small fry who did not have the resources to flee or the clout to find willing
patrons abroad to shelter them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#54:2>
The only good news in this context is Mr S.B. <w> Chavan's </w>
assurance that notifications will be issued to attach Dawood <w> Ibrahim's
</w> properties in Bombay and elsewhere, but even this announcement will
be seen to be a fall-out from the G.R. Khairnar episode.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#55:2>
In fact, since the CBI had been entrusted with the responsibility of
attaching these properties several months ago, the question may be asked why
nothing was done till the matter acquired a political dimension in the wake
of Mr <w> Khairnar's </w> courageous anti-corruption campaign.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#56:2>
It can be argued that the ruling <w> party's </w> internal power
struggles between the supporters and opponents of Mr Sharad Pawar have played
a crucial role in expediting official action on this score. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#57:2>
The run-up to the trial has been marked by the unfortunate
episode where a number of lawyers expressed their lack of confidence in
the special judge, Mr J.N. Patel.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#58:2>
Such incidents are, of course, not unknown in democratic societies,
but they almost always tend to cast a shadow over the proceedings and detract
from judicial dignity.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#59:2>
It will be a matter of regret if this happens in what is one of the
major trials of conspirators accused of <quote> " waging war" </quote> on the
country in the post-independence period.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#60:2>
Even if the big fish have escaped, the trial should still give some
idea of the nature and extent of the conspiracy and the role of foreign
powers.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#61:2>
In addition, it should reveal the loopholes in <w> India's </w>
security system which made it easy for the criminals to smuggle in arms and
ammunition from abroad.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#62:2>
In one respect, however, the authorities will have to be extra
vigilant during the period of the trial.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#63:2>
They must ensure that no organisation or influential individual is
able to use the occasion to foment communal sentiments.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#64:2>
One of the objectives of the conspirators, according to the
charge-sheet against them, was to engineer communal riots.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#65:2>
This aim must not succeed even when they are behind bars or are
absconding. </p> <*> a dark line in the middle </*>

<h> <bold> Matter of Concern </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#67:2>
One swallow does not make a summer.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#68:2>
So the fact that the rate of growth of exports has decelerated from
around 20 per cent in 1993-94 to just nine per cent, on a point-to-point
basis, in April-May 1994 over April-May 1993, should not cause despair.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#69:2>
The deceleration is serious enough, however, to warrant urgent
action.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#70:2>
Admittedly, point-to-point comparisons can be misleading,
especially if there are random fluctuations in the course of the year.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#71:2>
Since there is no reason to believe that there is a set seasonal
pattern in the movement of exports, it will be hasty to jump to conclusions
about the annual trend on the basis of the first two <w> months' </w>
performance.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#72:2>
Even then, it is a matter of concern that such a dramatic
reduction should have occurred.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#73:2>
Clearly, the government and businessmen must examine the underlying
factors and offer an explanation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#74:2>
One important factor that may have contributed to a decline in
exports is the revival of economic activity at home after two years of
near-stagnation in national income.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#75:2>
Secondly, the return of double-digit inflation, even when the
external value of the <indig> rupee </indig> has been held in check through
market intervention by the Reserve Bank of India, has made exports less
competitive.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#76:2>
Thirdly, it has been suggested by the commerce ministry that the
withdrawal of the price reimbursement scheme for engineering goods exporters
from April 1 may have hit exports adversely.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#77:2>
This should be immediately re-examined by the Union commerce and
finance ministries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-007#78:2>
The main reason, however, is that neither the government nor
domestic business paid enough attention to ensure a sustained increase in
exports.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#79:2>
Despite the persisting seriousness of the long-term balance of
payments scenario, given <w> India's </w> debt repayment obligations and its
need for imports to fuel industrial growth, action on the ground has been
slow and halting.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#80:2>
Little has been done so far to deal with the painful infrastructural
bottlenecks at the ports.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#81:2>
The corruption and inefficiency in customs and port handling
facilities have merely been dealt with on the surface.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#82:2>
The so-called action plans and corporate targets have not helped
alter the basic profile of Indian exports which continues to be dominated by
<quote> ` traditional goods' </quote> like gems and jewellery, garments and
so on.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#83:2>
One silver lining is the prospect of improved trade between India and
Russia.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#84:2>
The visit of the Indian Prime Minister has helped ease the two-way
trade, especially in commodities like tobacco and tea.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#85:2>
The potential is much bigger than what India can handle at the
moment, given supply-side bottlenecks.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#86:2>
Faced with such disappointing news from the export front, the
government might be tempted to resort to rash tactics like easing
agricultural and raw material exports.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#87:2>
While some of this is necessary, any export drive must keep an eye on
the domestic price line. </p> <*> a dark line in the middle </*>

Prior to his Russia visit, the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao,
might have chuckled over recent revelations by the CIA of how Beijing often
mixed banquets and <it> <quote> " gambay gambits" </quote> </it> while making
sitting ducks of the cream of U.S. foreign policy-makers during the 1970s.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#95:2>
A recent report described different techniques of peaceful
persuasion used by China in its diplomatic drive to promote its interests
in Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia and, to some extent, Hong Kong.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#96:2>
The revelations by the Rand Corporation on behalf of the CIA
pointedly mentioned the Sino-U.S. Shanghai communique of 1972, the year
President Nixon and his secretary of state, Mr Henry Kissinger, made their
dramatic secret trip to Beijing.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#97:2>
For many, a meal is a meal is a meal - - but the disclosures said
Beijing wangled it in such a way as to hold negotiations about Taiwan <quote>
" late at night after a banquet or Peking duck and powerful mao tai liquor"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#98:2>
Clearly the <it> <quote> " gambay gambits" </quote> </it> helped, as
the agency cited Mr Kissinger as declaring that <quote> " after a banquet of
Peking duck, I will sign anything" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#99:2>
The Shanghai communique reversed the 23-year-old <quote> " two
Chinas" </quote> policy of the U.S. and conceded that Taiwan was part of
mainland China.

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#100:2>
The report added that Premier Zhou Enlai and senior leaders <quote>
" manipulated the senior U.S. foreign policy-makers by holding opulent
banquets, by playing off the president against his domestic political rivals
and fully exploiting individual insecurities" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-007#101:2>
Speculating that Mr <w> Nixon's </w> re-election would benefit
China, Beijing cleverly complied when Mr Nixon, responding to Chinese views
that more delay would mean that the rival Democrats might appropriate credit
for new U.S. policy, frantically conveyed a message through Mr Kissinger that
no other U.S. politicians go to China until he did.
