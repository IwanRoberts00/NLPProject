Dear Dr ( Mrs.) Laxmi P. : 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#20:1>
Thank you very much for your letter dated 13th
April. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#21:1>
While I feel highly relieved of the responsibilities
as President of  
IAAS, I <}> <-> donot </- > <+> do not </+> </}> think I
deserve compliments  
for my handling of Presidency during the last two years. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#22:1>
I particularly could not effect certain long term
changes in the  
organizational set up and inject a commitment on the part of a
majority of  
members that transcends beyond ones own narrow personal
interest. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#23:1>
I expect better things under your stewardship. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#24:1>
Be that as it may, some answers to your queries
and some of my own musings. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#25:1>
I will send emblem with my next letter as it is still
with the local  
printer who has been reminded. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#26:1>
As far as names are concerned <-> as </-> I am
enclosing a copy of old letter head. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#27:1>
Their addresses are in the enclosed list. I kept in
touch with the EC  
members through circular letters sent at least three to four
times between two conferences. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#28:1>
If you can raise some funds for a seminar or symposium
as I was able  
to do, you can also arrange a meeting of the EC before the
next conference. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#29:1>
I am sending herewith a copy each of Newsletter No
1 of 1992 and 1993. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#30:1>
It is better you send the newsletter early this year
as many  
delegates are sending their papers to me as per my earlier
announcement. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#31:1>
I am enclosing the following five papers together with
letters in  
original. </p>

I would like you to know that a sum of Rs. 5395=80
is due to me  
from Treasurer on account of 1993 - 94 conference in addition
to some dues from 1992 - 93 accounts. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#34:1>
She has of <del> f </del> course told me that she will
settle the account when she comes to Bombay next time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#35:1>
But I thought you ought to know this fact. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#36:1>
In case you need any more information, I will be
happy to provide the same. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#37:1>
I will send you the next time the correspondence on
OIR. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#38:1>
It is better you be fully aware of the present status.

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#47:1>
Please send five copies of the book directly to our

We will buy them for the library. </p>

Please send a copy to Dr. Winton U. Solberg
Professor Emeritus of  
History, Dept. of History, University of Illinois at

309-Gregory Hall, 810 S outh Wright Street, Urbana, I L 61801,
under intimation to me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#50:1>
I am also sure that you will systematically send a
copy each to all  
contributors who were not able to collect their free copy at
Lucknow. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#51:1>
Before ending this letter I would like to share
with you two of  
my ideas for better organisation of publication and release of
proceedings in future. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#52:1>
I am stating this based on my experience of last <}>
<-> to </-> <+> two </+> </}> years. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#53:1>
First, we should restrict publication to only
those papers which  
were presented by the <}> <-> authores </-> <+> authors </+>
</}> at the  
conference or papers which were sent for presentation but
author could not  
remain present for one reason or the other. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#54:1>
This time, you first asked <O> continued on page 2
</O> Dr. Dilip  
Mohite to give a paper and later informed me the paper
included was neither  
presented nor written for the presentation at Goa Conference. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#55:1>
You justified it on the ground that otherwise, Volume
would have been slim. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#56:1>
Almost a week before the conference, Dr. Sondhi called
me <}> <-> litrally </-> <+> literally </+> </}> at midnight
to seek my permission for  
the inclusion of his paper; again one, that was neither
presented nor meant  
for presentation at Goa. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#57:1>
I had to say no to him. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#58:1>
Both, Dr. Sunil Sondhi and Dr. Mohite are not only
good weriters but  
very good friends of mine. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#59:1>
But should we permit our commercial interest to
override our academic  
principles ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#60:1>
One result of last minute addition is avoidable errors
in the  
introduction such as the one where I speak of 6 papers
dealing with  
American foreign policy while actually there are seven. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#61:1>
Second, we should be more elegent with our book
releasing function. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#62:1>
The copies were not only not wrapped but there was
only one copy each of the book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#63:1>
We should have been generous in giving a copy each to
the <}> <-> importent</-> <+> important </+> </}> dignitaries
on the dias at least those who were out-side invitees. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#64:1>
This could have been good P R work for the <mention> I
A A S. </mention> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#65:1>
Any way, I hope you will take these two suggestions
in a constructive spirit. </p>
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#66:1>
Once again many thanks for your cooperation during
my tenure as President. </p>

Dear Dr. Parasuram, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#84:1>
You must have received two of my earlier letters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#85:1>
I am enclosing herewith the following papers:- 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#86:1>
1. Dr. N.K. Jha - 1 copy

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#89:1>
4. Ms. K. Sangeetha Menon - 3 copies. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#90:1>
It is advisable to issue the first issue of the news
letter as early  
as possible so that other delegates can be informed to send
the papers to you  
directly rather than to me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#91:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#98:1>
Belated, but it is <}> <-> neverthess </-> <+>
nevertheless </+>  
</}> not too late for me to <quote> ` thank you' </quote> ,
for your agreeing  
to release the book, <ul> American studies in India: Essays in
History,  
Politics and Foreign Affairs, </ul> ed. by me, at the formal
inauguration of  
28th annual conference of the IAAS in Lucknow and also sharing
your thoughts  
on </quote> <+> " </+> Religion in contemporary America"
</quote> . </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#99:1>
We very much wanted to give you a copy each of the
book you  
released and also its companion volume, <ul> American
Literature Today </ul>  
edited by my colleague, Dr. Suman Bala. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#100:1>
However, due to shortage of copies on the first day I
could not arrange for it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#101:1>
I have now <del> as </del> asked our publishers, and
a member of our  
EC, Dr. R.K. Dhawan to send complimentary copy each of the two
publications,  
to you personally and another set to ASRC for the favour of
review. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#102:1>
These books were published on a hope that USEFI /
ASRC will be able to buy some copies in bulk. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#103:1>
Last year, USEFI had bought some fifty copies. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#104:1>
This year, USEFI, at present, has indicated their
inability to buy  
but Dr. Lavakare has advised me to approach you with a request
to buy some copies. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#105:1>
These copies could be very useful to distribute to
the participants  
in American civilization courses <}> <-> tor </-> <+> for </+>
</}> other  
courses conducted by the ASRC from time to time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#106:1>
May I, therefore request you to buy at least fifty
copies each of  
the two publications and help us to break even on the cost of
publication ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#107:1>
I will greatly <-> on the </-> appreciate your kind
gesture. </p>

Dear Prof. Singh: 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#120:1>
Thank you very much for your letter of April 26,
1994. 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#121:1>
On all four points mentioned by you, the IAAS in
principle  
cannot have any objection to collaborate. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#122:1>
However, in our system of working we have a
constitutional ban of  
two terms for presidency and, I have ceased to be President
after holding it for two terms. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#123:1>
Hence, I am forwarding a copy of your letter together
with my reply  
to Dr. ( Mrs.) Laxmi parasuram, President, for 1994 - 95. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#124:1>
Her own field is literature. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#125:1>
She will formally write to you on points one and
four. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#126:1>
However, I continue to be an ex-officio member of
the EC and  
also play a role as the Executive trustee of the IAAS trust. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#127:1>
Hence, in my personal capacity I will be more than
happy to extend  
whatever cooperation is needed on academic aspects of the
proposed congress. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#128:1>
Particularly, I will be personally interested to make
a  
presentation, if invited, on Intellectual Prosperty Rights or
Role of  
American studies in the Development of Human Resources. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#129:1>
An abridged copy of my CV is enclosed for your
perusal. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#130:1>
IAAS has its own newsletter where the item on the
proposed  
Congress can be inserted. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#131:1>
You may also approach American studies Research
Centre, Hyderabad  
500 001 for their collaboration, if you have not already done
so. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#132:1>
I am on their Board of Directors, at present. </p>

Dear Dr. ( Mrs.) Laxmi: 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#154:1>
I just received your circular letter dated 30 / 4
and a letter  
of the same date only yesterday. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#155:1>
I have sent you three registered letters on 20 / 4,
on 26 / 4 and  
third on 2 / 5 / prior to this letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#156:1>
These letters must have answered some of your
queries. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-025#157:1>
I did not get any papers / rubber stamps etc from
Prof. Dalal,  
my predecessor. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#158:1>
Hence, there is no general rubber stamp that you can
use. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#159:1>
Rubber stamps made by me are of no use to you as they
carry Bombay  
adress. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#160:1>
I have some envelops and letter pads but you cannot
<+> use </+>  
some more membership forms and membership cards are with me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#161:1>
I will send them to you, if you urgently need them. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#162:1>
Use them as they carry Bombay address. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#163:1>
However, Enclosed are three sets of papers with their
letters in  
original from the following. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-025#164:1>
