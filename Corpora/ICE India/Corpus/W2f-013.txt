<ICE-IND:W2F-013#3:1>
<bold> His was a classic case of <quote> ` habits die hard'</quote>.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#4:1>
<w> Atul's </w> tendency of worrying too much invariably landed him
into trouble time and again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#5:1>
The older he got the more he worried.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#6:1>
And then something happened to make him think twice of this aspect of
his nature.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#9:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ATUL </smallcaps> </bold> did not remember exactly
how and when it started.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#10:1>
He remembered having a carefree, tension free life till high school.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#11:1>
It was somewhere around junior college that he started worrying too
much.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#12:1>
It all began gradually, first with examinations.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#13:1>
What if I fail?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#14:1>
All my friends will go ahead of me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#15:1>
What will my parents say?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#16:1>
And my brother who has been passing all his exams effortlessly with a
first class ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#17:1>
Will he tease me ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#18:1>
These were some of the thoughts which entered his mind even before
appearing in the exams.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#19:1>
But all his worries were however superfluous as he always passed
with flying colours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#20:1>
The older he got, the more he worried.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#21:1>
His most patent worry was his family.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#22:1>
He always expected to find somebody dead when he returned home
from outing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#23:1>
And if somebody failed to return by the promised time, he started
pacing the floor, not resting till the concerned person arrived. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#24:1>
If a group of girls were seen chattering he always thought that
he was the topic of their discussion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#25:1>
They are gossiping about me, he worried, was the cigarette I smoked
yesterday the topic of their gossip <*> dotted line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#26:1>
And then he took admission in a reputed engineering college.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#27:1>
Being away from his family reduced his worries at least on the home
front.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#28:1>
No news is good news was his new motto.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#29:1>
He found <*> dotted line </*> girl in Vaishali as his girl friend and
there was friend Rahul as his room mate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#30:1>
One day <w> Rahul's </w> cycle was missing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#31:1>
Atul our hero, seemed worrying instantly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#32:1>
What if Rahul thinks that I have stolen it since only I know where
he keeps the keys?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#33:1>
This thought worried him till the cycle was found the next day with
another friend who had broken the lock and taken the cycle due to an
emergency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#34:1>
One day Atul confessed this habit of worrying unnecessarily to
Rahul and asked for his advice.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#35:1>
Why don't you maintain a diary in which you can pen down all that is
troubling you, Rahul asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#36:1>
Giving vent to your worries will help you reduce them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#37:1>
Atul liked the idea of sharing his worries with someone, so what if
it was only a diary ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#38:1>
And thus began a <quote> ` heart-to-heart' </quote> with the
diary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#39:1>
One day, Atul fell down from the bus and hurt his knee badly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#40:1>
What if it gets gangrenous and needs to be amputated ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#41:1>
He wrote what was troubling him in the diary.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#42:1>
What happened to your leg ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#43:1>
Rahul asked him the neat day and Atul narrated the whole incident to
him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#44:1>
Well, one of my friends had a similar accident and his leg had to be
amputated, so take care, saying this Rahul left.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#45:1>
Atul felt as if the sky had fallen over his head.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#46:1>
He couldn't concentrate on anything till his leg healed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#47:1>
Then came their college elections.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#48:1>
On election day, a lot of crackers were burst in the <w> principal's
</w> room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#49:1>
And lo!

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#50:1>
Again began his ceaseless worries.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#51:1>
The principal is definitely going to suspect me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#52:1>
My instinct tells me so and he was even glaring at me when he
discovered the crackers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#53:1>
What if he accuses me ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#54:1>
What if I can't clear myself properly of the charges against me, he
will suspend me and then I'll be finished.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#55:1>
He wrote all this in his diary to lessen tension.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#56:1>
Next day the principal assembled every one in the drawing hall and
to <w> Atul's </w> horror confronted him directly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#57:1>
<quote> " Atul, I have eye witness who swear to have seen you
bursting the crackers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#58:1>
What have you to say to that?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#59:1>
<quote> " No, no," </quote> he stammered and started
perspiring.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#60:1>
<quote> " Your silence itself signifies that you are the culprit.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#61:1>
But as this is your first mistake, I am letting you go.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#62:1>
Take care not to repeat such things in the future," </quote> saying
this the principal dispersed the assembly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#63:1>
Atul was speechless.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#64:1>
But I have not done it, shouted his conscience.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#65:1>
Then why did the principal single me out, he wondered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#66:1>
That <w> year's </w> college elections led to a big fight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#67:1>
Atul who was a silent spectator to all the mindless violence watched
in horror as his colleague was brutally knifed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#68:1>
He ran for his life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#69:1>
Later in the day he sat and shared this with his diary.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#70:1>
Today I have watched something which I should not have.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#71:1>
What if the police start questioning me and as always I get bogged
down by nervousness ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#72:1>
Like the college principal they will think that I have murdered
him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#73:1>
Then what ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#74:1>
<w> I'll </w> be jailed, ruined for life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#75:1>
God help me please, he wrote in his diary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#76:1>
The next day, his worst fears were confirmed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#77:1>
The police singled him out and took him away for questioning.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#78:1>
Atul was shocked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#79:1>
What is happening to me, he asked himself again and again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#80:1>
But this one time his senses worked faster than usual.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#81:1>
He answered all the questions put by the police very confidently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#82:1>
He even consented to take the lie detector test.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#83:1>
The police were a little confused.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#84:1>
They started to confer amongst themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#85:1>
<quote> " But he was very positive <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#86:1>
I really don't know how <*> ditted line</*>" </quote> were some of
the phrases Atul caught.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#87:1>
<quote> " Okay, son you may go now," </quote> the police Inspector
finally told Atul.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#88:1>
Atul thanked him profusely. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#89:1>
As a parting shot, he asked the Inspector as to what made them
suspect him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#90:1>
<quote> " Rahul told us he had seen you and if we question you to
that effect, you would confess easily," </quote> replied the inspector.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#91:1>
The reply hit Atul like lighting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#92:1>
Why Rahul ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#93:1>
Why would he falsely implicate me, thought he. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#94:1>
The next day was spent in pondering about <w> Rahul's </w> motive
behind the allegation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#95:1>
But Atul just couldn't find any answer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#96:1>
He decided to call it a day and went to bed early.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#97:1>
Hey buddy, not writing your diary tonight ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#98:1>
Nothing to worry about I presume !

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#99:1>
Rahul joked and went away to watch television.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#100:1>
Atul smiled and was just drifting to sleep when he suddenly sat bolt
upright as a striking thought hit him forcefully.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#101:1>
What had Rahul said that he had not written anything in his diary
tonight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#102:1>
How had he known?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#103:1>
Unless he was reading his diary!

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#104:1>
Of course !

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#105:1>
Many things clicked into place at once. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#106:1>
Atul immediately felt an urge to talk to the police inspector
which he did.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#107:1>
<quote> " You couldn't have come at a better time," </quote> the
inspector said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#108:1>
<quote> <+> " </+> We already have evidence that your friend Rahul
is behind the murder.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#109:1>
Why don't you write this down in your diary tonight," </quote> he
said giving Atul a piece of paper on which something was writtn.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#110:1>
<quote> " We will wait and watch after that." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#111:1>
As per the <w> Inspector's </w> instructions, Atul wrote in his
diary that night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#112:1>
The knife used in the fight and the one that committed the murder
was mine.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#113:1>
If this information is known to the police, I am finished. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#114:1>
After writing this Atul slept soundly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#115:1>
He woke up in the morning to the news of <w> Rahul's </w> arrest.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#116:1>
What happened, he asked the Inspector later.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#117:1>
<quote> " Your friend came in the morning with a hint to question
you about the knife.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#118:1>
We questioned him instead and he has confessed." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#119:1>
Many puzzles fell in place for Atul.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#120:1>
Rahul had experimented with Atul in the <w> principal's </w> case
and had succeeded.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#121:1>
So he had taken a bold step, committed a murder and had tried to
implicate him falsely. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#122:1>
<quote> " What now, son?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#123:1>
The Inspector asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#124:1>
Well for one thing no more worrying from now on.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#125:1>
I have had enough.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#126:1>
I am going to take Vaishali out tonight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#127:1>
Oh God ! look at the time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#128:1>
<w> I'll </w> have to run.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#129:1>
Vaishali must be waiting for me at the theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#130:1>
She is alone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#131:1>
What if somebody kidnaps her <*> dotted line </*> </p> <*> black

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#134:2>
<bold> Vishal was aghast.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#135:2>
He couldn't believe that his mother was a murderer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#136:2>
A murderer of tiny, innocent girl infants.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#137:2>
But the facts could not be ignored.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#138:2>
So, all set to arrest his own mother, he is in for another surprise

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#140:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> WHAT </smallcaps> </bold> has to be done, has to
be done - - the area chief inspector said to Vishal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#141:2>
<quote> " You can't beat the facts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#142:2>
It is all before you and now it is entirely your decision."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#143:2>
Vishal kept staring at the file before him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#144:2>
It was a very hard decision to take.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#145:2>
If the facts in the file were correct and to be believed, he had to
go and arrest someone immediately - his own mother ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#146:2>
Vishal was born the third son to a coal mine labourer in
Gopalpur.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#147:2>
His early days were full of poverty and misery and his father tried
very hard to make both ends meet somehow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#148:2>
But the marriages of his sisters and his own studies made Vishal
worry about their future.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#149:2>
His mother too shared his thoughts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#150:2>
So to take care of these forthcoming cost implications, <w>
Vishal's </w> mother took on the job of a <indig> <it> <quote> ` dai'
</quote> </it> </indig> without Vishal or his <w> sister's </w> knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#151:2>
<indig> <it> Dais </it> </indig> were abundant in this area.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#152:2>
They were basically helpers ( or midwives ) helping women during
advance stages of delivery and the actual delivery of children. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#153:2>
But behind this honourable work lay a dark secret.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#154:2>
If the new born baby was a girl child, she was immediately handed
over to the <indig> <it> dai </it> </indig> in most cases for termination.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#155:2>
So the <indig> <it> dais </it> </indig> took on the job of killing
female infants at the behest of parents on payment of a fee.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#156:2>
The killing patterns varied and were very inhumane but the fees
remained the same.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#157:2>
The <indig> <it> dai </it> </indig> could earn anything upto <indig>
Rs. </indig> 1000 for killing a female infant but only a few hundred <indig>
rupees </indig> to deliver a healthy male infant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#158:2>
<w> Vishal's </w> mother averaged about six deliveries a week and
soon the family prospered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#159:2>
As a child, Vishal could not understand the sudden prosperity
of his family and neither did he care.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#160:2>
He was only concerned about his studies and sports and that was
being taken care of.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#161:2>
But he did observe the sudden change of attitude people began to
have towards his mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#162:2>
She commanded a new aura of respect.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#163:2>
People close to the family started calling her <quote> ` Godmother'
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#164:2>
<w> Vishal's </w> parents also started to have long and sometimes
heated discussions late into the night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#165:2>
Vishal saw small bundles of clothes being whisked away in his <w>
uncle's </w> autorickshaw late at nights.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#166:2>
All these things frightened Vishal and when his parents suggested
that he join a boarding school for brighter prospects, he readily accepted.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#167:2>
Vishal was a very bright student and he did very well in his
studies as well as sports.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#168:2>
He was so busy in these activities that it became increasingly
difficult for him to visit his Gopalpur house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#169:2>
But the increasing prosperity of his family never failed to impress
him whenever he visited his parents.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#170:2>
He even mentioned this to his mother saying that it frightened
him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#171:2>
But his mother assured him that everything was <w> God's </w> gift
and that she or his father were doing nothing wrong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#172:2>
Vishal felt somewhat relieved but he never could understand the
respect his mother commanded or why people called her ` Godmother'.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#173:2>
Nobody would answer even if he asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#174:2>
They would only say that she was the best thing after God.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#175:2>
All this was difficult for Vishal to understand, so to make himself
happy, he concluded that his mother was doing a lot of social work and the
grateful people had given her the title. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#176:2>
Vishal passed all his exams in flying colours and passed his
IPS exams without any trouble.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#177:2>
He was posted at a place far away from his home.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#178:2>
His job gave him many challenges and adventures and soon he <O>
<&> page </&> 38 </O> <&> In two and a half columns </&> <O> drawing in
<mention> box </mention> </O> was recognised as one of the best officer in
the police services. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#179:2>
One day an old couple came searching for him and on meeting him
promptly fell at his feet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#180:2>
They kept on saying that they had a lot to thank his mother for.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#181:2>
Vishal did not understand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#182:2>
What were these old couple saying ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#183:2>
He could only make out that they were talking about their daughter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#184:2>
He could also understand that their daughter was now married and
happily settled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#185:2>
Finally the couple was turned out by the constables.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#186:2>
Vishal tried to forget the incident. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#187:2>
The coming year saw Vishal getting married.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#188:2>
He was always posted away from home but he had secretly resolved
that his wife would deliver their first baby in his hometown Gopalpur.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#189:2>
So when she became pregnant, he took a long leave and after many
years returned to his hometown along with her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#190:2>
Word that he had arrived spread like fire in the small town and
many old friends started visiting him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#191:2>
One such friend asked him where his wife was going to deliver the
baby.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#192:2>
<quote> " Oh of course in the hospital," </quote> said Vishal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#193:2>
<quote> " Your mother won't deliver it ? " </quote> asked the friend
<quote> " of course not!" </quote> said Vishal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#194:2>
<quote> <+> " </+> I did not even know that she delivers babies"
</quote> Vishal thought that this was part of his <w> mother's </w> social
work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#195:2>
<quote> " Oh she does and is very famous for it," </quote> said his
friend and parted.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#196:2>
Vishal forgot about the episode. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-013#197:2>
The area chief inspector met Vishal the next day.

<quote> " Yes" </quote> . said the inspector, <quote> " it is
shocking.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#205:2>
We can't arrest her immediately for want of evidence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#206:2>
You talk to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#207:2>
Ask her where the graves or furnaces are and remember we have to
make the arrest, together if needed.

Whatever has to be done has to be done." </quote> </p>

Vishal made his way home with a heavy heart.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#210:2>
His mother greeted him at the door.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#211:2>
He spoke to her directly, <quote> " Where are the graves mother?"

How could you do such a horrible deed mother ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#215:2>
Now I know why people called you Godmother !

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#216:2>
You helped the poor infants reach God before they lived their life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#217:2>
Why mother? Why?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#218:2>
<quote> " I have nothing to say," </quote> said his mother.

<quote> " Before you arrest her, take a look at these
photographs." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#223:2>
He handed him the album.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#224:2>
Inside were photographs of young ladies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#225:2>
<quote> " Who are they?" </quote> asked Vishal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#226:2>
<quote> " The female infants your mother was supposed to kill.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#227:2>
There are no graves, son.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#228:2>
Your mother never killed a child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#229:2>
The parents were always so chicken hearted that they never confirmed
the death of their little girl.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#230:2>
Your mother was paid on her word.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#231:2>
All the children were brought here and promptly placed in some
social organisations for adoption.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#232:2>
In fact you have even met one couple who were childless and had
benefited from your <w> mother's </w> greatness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-013#233:2>
Still if you feel she is a culprit, go ahead and arrest her."
