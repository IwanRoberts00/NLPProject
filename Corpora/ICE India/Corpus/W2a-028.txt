<h> <bold> Abstract </bold> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#5:1>
Ferroelectric semiconducting crystals of lead telluride were grown by
fusing lead and tellurium in vacuum.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#6:1>
Optical as well as electrical properties were studied to characterize
the grown polycrystalline samples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#7:1>
For the purpose of comparison experiments were also performed with the
single crystal of the material also.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#8:1>
The typical C.V characteristics obtained from the fabricated
Al-BaTiO<sb>3</sb>- PbTe( MIS ) structures were also investigated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#9:1>
From XRD data, the lattice constant comes out to be 3.34A.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#10:1>
An overall decrease in mobility and resistivity with increasing
temperature ( from 77K to 300K ) is observed while the carrier concentration
shows a reverse behaviour.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#11:1>
Results with MOS capacitor are found to be in good agreement with the
earlier reported works. </p>

electrical properties of PbTe bulk samples. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#23:1>
The metal-insulator-semiconductor ( MIS ) diodes, which are the
most useful devices in the study of semiconductor surfaces, have been studied
by several workers [ 9, 10 ] .

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#24:1>
Lily <it> et al </it> [ 11 ] reported some experimental results on
MIS structures fabricated from ( 100 ) PbTe bulk single crystals at 77K.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#25:1>
However, studies on MIS diodes made of PbTe bulk sample at room
temperature were not given much attention so far. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#26:1>
In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to study
the carrier transport properties in p-PbTe single crystal and laboratory
grown polycrystalline samples of n-type PbTe by the experimental measurements

<h> <it> 2.1 Charge growth and sample preparation : </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#30:1>
For charge growth, according to molecular weight composition of
PbTe, the required quantities of elemental Pb and Te ( each of 5N purity )
were taken in a specially shaped clean quartz tube and the tube was vacum
sealed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#31:1>
Vacuum of the order of 10<sp><*>minus</*>6</sp> torr was produced by
a vacuum pumping system ( Hindhivac, model V.S.- 65 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#32:1>
The ampoule containing the materials was heated in an electric
furnace at a temperature of 1000 <*> degrees</*>C for about 28 hours
continuously.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#33:1>
The furnace temperature could be determined using a pt-pt / Rb
thermocouple and a digital milivoltmeter ( AGRONIC 34A-4 model ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#34:1>
The furnace was cooled slowly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#35:1>
The formed material was then cut into almost rectangular shape of
dimensions 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.0 mm<sp>3</sp> from the bowl with a microslicer - 2
using a very fine blade.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#36:1>
The samples were then ground with coarse and fine carborundum powder
of grades 600, 800 and 1200 consecutively to obtain flat and parallel slides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#37:1>
These were then first roughly polished on a polishing paper and then
using diamond compound ( Hifin fluid <quote> ` OS' </quote> ) on a smooth
polishing cloth fixed to a rotating disc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#38:1>
The <}> <- > smples </-> <+> samples </+> </}> were cleaned first
with 4 % hydrofluoric acid and then with acetone. </p>

Philips diffractometer ( PW 1130 / 00 model ) with Bragg-Brentano
arrangement was used for XRD studies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#41:1>
For conductivity and mobility measurements, Vander Pauw technique [
12 ] was employed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#42:1>
Pure Indium was used to make ohmic contacts on the samples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#43:1>
The cryostat was of conventional design.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#44:1>

A well polished slice of PbTe was cleaned by treating it first
with a solution of KOH, ethylene glycol and H<sb>2</sb>O<sb>2</sb> ( 10 : 10

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#52:1>
A layer of pure Indium provided the back ohmic contact.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#53:1>
The thin insulating oxide layer of BaTiO<sb>3</sb> was deposited on
the semiconducting surface by RF sputtering using NM Nordiko 1500 RF
sputtering system.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#54:1>
The top contact electrodes over the oxide layer were made by
evaporating 99.99 % pure aluminium in circular shapes ( diameter <*>
approximate- sign</*> 400 <*> mu</*><it>m</it> ) using a copper mesh.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#55:1>
A Hindhivac vacuum coating unit model No. 12A4 was employed for this
purpose.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#56:1>

<h> <bold> 3. Results and discussions </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#61:1>
The XRD patterns of laboratory grown pellets are shown in Figure
1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#62:1>
The XRD pattern of a typical ( 002)- cut single crystal is also shown
in the figure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#63:1>
In figures, it can be noted that <O> figure 1. </O> <O> caption </O>
the peak at 2<*>theta</*> = 27.5<*>degrees</*> for single crystal is almost
reproduced in the present grown sample at 2<*>theta</*> = 27<*>degrees</*>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#64:1>
The slight difference in the value of 2<*>theta</*> reflactions for (
002 ) may be attributed to the difference of stoichiometry in the two
materials and the method of preparation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#65:1>
The lattice constant calculated from the XRD data using the relations
for cubic crystals comes out to be <*> approximate-sign</*> 3.34A. </p> <O>
figure 2. </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 24 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#66:1>
The variation of mobility with temperature for PbTe single
crystal and laboratory grown crystal are shown in Figure 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#67:1>
The mobility decreases with increasing temperature for both the
samples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#68:1>
However, it can be noted that the curves in the figure exhibit two
distinct regions of low ( 77K-150K ) and high ( 150K-300K ) temperatures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#69:1>
The rate of decrease of mobility is slower in lower temperature
region than that in higher temperature region.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#70:1>
In the low temperature region, the observed lincarity of curves
clearly suggest that only one type of carriers contribute to the conduction
process and the mobility corresponds to the light holes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#71:1>
The steep fall of the mobility in the high temperature region in
general is attributed <O> table 1. </O> to an increased contribution of heavy
holes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#72:1>
Also the overall nature of the curves for both the samples is similar
except in the magnitude thereby, supporting the XRD data.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#73:1>
The calculated values of a are given in Table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#74:1>
The results of single crystal sample is in close agreement with the
reported values for the p-PbTe single crystal [ 13 ] , the observed
variations of resistivity with temperature are shown in Figure 3.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#75:1>
The values of carrier concentration <quote> <it> ` n' </it> </quote>
using the mobility and resistivity data are depicted in Figure 4.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#76:1>
The variation in <quote> <it> ` n' </it> </quote> clearly indicates a
monotonous decrease with decreasing temperature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#77:1>
The corresponding calculated conductivities have been shown in Figure
5. </p> <O> figure 3. </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#78:1>
In order to investigate the temperature dependence of the
depletion capacitance in the inversion region for verifying whether it
follows any Curie law dependence, a series of MIS were fabricated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#79:1>
However, except for BaTiO<sb>3</sb> which was RF sputtered on PbTe
substrate at <O> <&> page </&> 25 </O> room temperature, all other insulators
investigated revealed very poor surface conductivity modulation property of
the base PbTe semiconductor due to their low resistivity and <O> figure 4.
</O> <O> caption </O> probably presence of pin-holes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#80:1>
One other major factor affecting these devices was the poor surface
finish of the PbTe sample.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#81:1>
Efforts to decrease roughness of the sample have been <O> figure 5.
</O> <O> caption </O> seriously limited by the technical limitation of our
lab.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#82:1>
The conventional high frequency C-V behaviour for a capacitor with
BaTiO<sb>3</sb> layer is shown in Figure 6.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#83:1>
The measured <O> figure 6. </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 26
</O> accumulation capacitance of 48.8 pF corresponds to the insulator
BaTiO<sb>3</sb> according to the conventional MOS theories [ 14 ] .

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#84:1>
The calculated value of the dielectric constant for BaTiO<sb>3</sb>
film <*> approximate-sign</*> 15 is in good agreement with reported values
for amorphous BaTiO<sb>3</sb> films [ 11 ] . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#85:1>
The observed shift in the flat band voltage towards the negative
voltage region is commonly attributed towards a high percentage of interface
state density at the BaTiO<sb>3-</sb> PbTe junction and the increase of
capacitance beyond <*> plus</*>4 volts is probably due to sudden increase in
the conductance value of the film.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#86:1>
The results thus suggest that although the capacitance varies with
applied voltage, the dielectric strength of BaTiO<sb>3</sb> film is not
enough to induce inversion in the underlying PbTe layer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#87:1>
Reports of Lilly <it> et al </it> [ 11 ] and Moulin <it> et al
</it> [ 15 ] also reveal that MIS properties are strongly determined by
preparation and fabrication techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#88:1>
They also report that small capacitance changes are to be expected
experimentally and that insulator dielectric strength in excess of
10<sp>6</sp> V cm<sp>-1</sp> are required in order to obtain surface
potential control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#89:1>
The observed small change of capacitance is thus well supported and
in agreement with the theoretical prediction. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#90:1>
<h> <bold> 4. Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#91:1>
PbTe polycrystalline samples were prepared by fusing Pb and Te in
vacuum at 1000<*>degrees</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#92:1>
The XRD patterns of these samples though indicate a preferred
orientation along the ( 002 ) axis, these samples cannot be strictly
categorised as single crystals due to the obvious nature of the simple
techniques employed in growing them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#93:1>
However, the relative slow cooling ( <*> approximate-sign</*>
10<*>degrees</*>C / hr ) employed in this case may have resulted in large
degree of reduction of its polycrystalline nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-028#94:1>
Almost similar behaviour of mobility and resistivity curves for both
the samples also suggests a near single crystal nature of the laboratory
growth crystals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-028#95:1>
For MIS studies, the present work reveals that probably higher
thickness of the insulating film and better surface finish of PbTe may help
in realizing these MOS capacitors and efforts are now being made in these
lines to achieve better device quality. </p>
