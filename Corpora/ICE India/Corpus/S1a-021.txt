For twelfth she had a <{> <[> nervous break down </[> and then <,,>
so the doctors advised her not to take up anything serious

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#189:1:C>
Very regular

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#190:1:A>
I know ever since <,> like when I was studying <,> we had
this specials at eight <w> O'clock </w> <,> and at one forty they <,> stand
wait outside our college to pick us up <,> almost like a college bus special
bus for us <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#191:1:B>
That is according to the college <{> <[> times </[> they

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#192:1:A>
<[> College time </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#193:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#194:1:A>
Yeah <,> suppose exams

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#195:1:C>
But they have the other buses also no <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#196:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#197:1:A>
That you have <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#198:1:B>
Madras is known for that you know <,> <{> <[> yeah yeah <,,>
TTB service very best service they have

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#199:1:C>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#200:1:A>
And <,> every year in the beginning of the year we invite all
the <,> the crew no <{1> <[1> yeah <,> like uh outside one forty when college
gets over around thirteen to fourteen buses to different parts of the city
<{2> <[2> uhm <,> will be standing outside the college

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#201:1:C>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#202:1:C>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#203:1:A>
Specially our college girl are <,> we give uh a very good
reason to this people

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#204:1:A>
I mean we give them a party <{> <[> and we <O> one or two words
</O> </[> in your college also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#205:1:B>
<[> Even in our college </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#206:1:B>
It is just <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#207:1:A>
Oh the WCC they had a <O> one word </O> <,> drivers and the
<?> PBC </?> crew and the principal

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#208:1:A>
So that service is not regular that <,> it has once <,> one or two
I think <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#209:1:A>
But yeah there are so many bus standing outside <,> and then you
know it is fun <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#210:1:A>
Sometimes the bus are almost empty no like <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>
the <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#211:1:A>
And like that one we had a bus in Adiyar we have a bus <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#212:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#213:1:A>
And it is not necessary no <,> you can have the <{> <[> same
bus </[> which passes through Adiyar to Tirvani but we have to <,,> see
almost empty <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#214:1:B>
<[> Same bus </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#215:1:A>
But anyway <,> it is very comfortable <,> <{> <[> oh yeah <,>
and also in buses here in Mysore also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#216:1:A>
We have the first half for men and the second <{> <[> half for
women </[> Hyderabad also it is like that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#217:1:C>
<[> Oh yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#218:1:B>
<[> Even in Hyderabad </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#219:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-021#225:1:C>
Now they have

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#226:1:B>
But one thing

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#227:1:C>
We have got used to it I think only then <,> recently some
two months back I think <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#228:1:A>
Uhm uhm and in Madras suppose the men are sitting in the
ladies seat <,> ladies have to go stand next to them they will get up

<w> It's </w> not very healthy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-021#287:1:B>
Yeah because <O> one or two words </O>
