<I>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#1:1:A>
 Uh you know the University

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#2:1:B>
 <O> A few words </O> as it is

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#3:1:A>
 Of course we speak on <O> one or two words </O>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#4:1:B>
 Uh

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#5:1:A>
 So specially <,> when I heard about this Indian English today
morning <,,> I felt <,,> uh that uh <,,> he did not specifically <,> point
out uh <,> what exactly is Indian English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#6:1:A>
 Because uh <,> in our room <,> there is a Maharashtrian <,> and uh
there is a Punjabi <,> <}> <-> Kannadian </-> <+> Kannadiga </+> </}> and <,>
<w> we've </w> some of Telugu speaking people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#7:1:A>
 But when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation <,>
I didn't find much difference <,> one from the other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#8:1:A>
 But uh in the class room situation sometimes <,> uh we find <,>
students <w> they're </w> trying to speak in English <,,> uh they <,,> bring
in that <,> uh Telugu accent <,> but uh they don't have much to refer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#9:1:A>
 Uh when I teach also <,,> whenever I teach use the correct accent
<,> sometimes <w> I've </w> to come down to their level and uh speak
otherwise <,> they may not be able to learn from this

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#10:1:B>
 Yes yes <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#11:1:A>
 They make take up for example word like uh work <,> <{> <[> uh
<,> you know unless they spell it <,> sometimes they may not be able to read
it up <,> even when I read

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#12:1:B>
 <[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#13:1:A>
 So <,,> at that level <,,> uh sometimes uh <,> a butler <,>
speaking uh somebody who are influenced by <,> people who are speaking
English <,> picked up words <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#14:1:A>
 Such people when they are speaking <,> there may be some difference
in accent or <,> uh their use in the words <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#15:1:A>
 But generally the educated uh <,> people I don't find much
variation <,,> but in uh <,> accent there may be a variation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#16:1:A>
 So what do you think about that variation ?

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#17:1:B>
 Of course I agree with you to so many time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#18:1:B>
 But still I think <,> the influence of the vernacular <,> language
<,,> is there on Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#19:1:B>
 For example <,> the latters are not in the habits of <,>
pronouncing the <,,> for example there is <}> <-> a a </-> <=> a </=> </}>
jocular statement also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#20:1:B>
 If anyone is going there <,> in the <indig> veranda </indig> <,,>
if <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> Bengali happens to see him <,> he just says
like this <,,> <quote> <w> He's </w> wandering in the <indig> verandah
</indig> </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#21:1:B>
 He won't pronounce the V such a differences may be there

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#22:1:A>
 Of <}> <-> all </-> <=> all </=> </}> the accents

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#23:1:B>
 Accent

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#24:1:A>
 That accent may be different

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#25:1:B>
 Accent may be different <,> but as far as the language and
other parts are concerned <,> there may not be <,> much difference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#26:1:B>
 Only accent and intonation <,> may be different <,> because <,>
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation <,>
depending upon the vernacular language <,> which he is say have just
habituated to use <,,> from the time of birth <,> till the end <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#27:1:B>
 These vocal chords should be adjusted <,,> in such a way <,,> that
uh they always <,,> uh <w> they're </w> <,> in favour of <,,> a such a kind
of particular intonation and accent <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#28:1:A>
 <w> That's </w> why <,> the difference <,,> if at all is the
difference is there <,> in Indian English <,,> depending on the various
states <,,> in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#29:1:A>
 It is mainly as you said <,> it is mainly which is not an
intonation and accent <,> as far as the language part is concerned <,>
vocabulary is concerned <,,> one need not find uh

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#30:1:B>
 Naturally you won't find much difference <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#31:1:A>
 So what I <,> wanted to impress upon you is uh <,,> the
influence of English on vernacular languages <,> definitely is there <,> <{1>
<[1> yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#32:1:A>
 In even in Telugu sometimes when we use the word like <,,> uh
master <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,,> English word

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#33:1:B>
 <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#34:1:B>
 <[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#35:1:B>
 But it has come down to the level of uh <,,> becoming
completely vernacular word <,> master

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#36:1:A>
 I know

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#37:1:B>
 So <,> that difference is there <,> and I can understand that
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#38:1:B>
 And the same way these languages uh <,,> might be influencing
English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#39:1:B>
 And the Indian writers writing in English <,,> especially persons
like R K Narayan and uh <,> Raja Rao then come down to <O> one word </O>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#40:1:A>
 Raja Rao made an experiment

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#41:1:B>
 He made an experiment <,>
<ICE-IND:S1A-015#42:1:B>
 Even uh <,,> R K Narayan was writing <,,> he tried specifically to
bring in Indian humour <,> flavour Indian kind of words in Indian English
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#43:1:B>
 Uh so that way deliberately or <,> unintentionally <,> these people
might have brought some words of Indianism <,> or Indian words into the <,,>
literature part <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#44:1:B>
 But Indian English as it is <,,> because whole India is filled by
speaking <}> <-> English </-> <=> English </=> </}> in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#45:1:B>
 So Indian English as it is <,> gramatically <,,> or uh <,>
vocabulary wise <,> or lexican uh what you call it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#46:1:B>
 Then I don't mind such difference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#47:1:B>
 See because uh <,> we were taught only what is the standardise
English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#48:1:B>
 And you know the newspapers magazines <,> so magazines is just uh
mostly trying to imitate uh American English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#49:1:B>
 Specially these uh <,> film magazines or uh the <O> one word </O>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#50:1:B>
 Then American English because they are more uh stylish <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#51:1:B>
 Stylish <,,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#52:1:A>
 So <,> British English is easier than

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#53:1:B>
 Easier because they have brought such a changes <,> which you
which uh which adopt and make you easy

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#54:1:A>
 But then uh another kind of uh people we come across these
days <,> uh the children special who are taken in uh <,> uh christian schools
or uh

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#55:1:B>
 Missionary

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#56:1:A>
 Uh urbanised schools <,> say public schools <,> that we all
know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very
artificial

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#57:1:B>
 Yes

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#58:1:A>
 You see most note particular <,> group and particular group
they alone can understands what they speak <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#59:1:A>
 But in general if they rightly try to speak to other people <,> uh
those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#60:1:A>
 <w> They're </w> trying to drag a new word in the conversation
unnecessary accent and something attracting something <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#61:1:A>
 Means that is another kind of trend which going on

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#62:1:B>
 Going on <,> in all Catholics

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#63:1:A>
 So <,> another thing is uh they <,> isolate themeselves <,>
feeling that they are uh quiet superior <,> because they are able to speak so
fluently that language and <}> <-> American </-> <=> American </=> </}>
language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#64:1:A>
 So that trend is <,,> formed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#65:1:A>
 But what I <,> what really to grasp from <,> uh <,> <{> <[> from
his lecture <,> from this lecture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#66:1:A>
 What exactly is the meaning of English <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#67:1:A>
 Mean how really it differs from this standardized British English
or uh <,> whatever you may call it <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#68:1:B>
 <[> From his lecture </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#69:1:B>
 <indig> Nei </indig> the language as people say there is
nothing like real standard <,> because uh people <,> use it as uh <,,> I mean
if you come to Telugu Telugu is spoken in different styles and <{> <[>
different ways </[> and though we <,,> mannerise literature in Telugu <,> and
cinemas in Telugu <,,> is using a particular kind of standerdised English
Telugu <,,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#70:1:A>
 <[> Yes <w> there's </w> different styles </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#71:1:B>
 That way some people are influenced <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#72:1:B>
 But if you come to a place like uh <,> Hyderabad <,> and <w> it's
</w> mostly more <,> uh your accent is completely Urdu <,> kind <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#73:1:B>
 When you go to Orissa <,> in uh Berrakpur <,> uh

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#74:1:A>
 In Orissa oriya

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#75:1:B>
 Oriya is there completely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#76:1:B>
 When you go to Chittoor definitely <w> you'll </w> find the <,>
southern influence is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#77:1:B>
 See the word <,> completely <O> one word </O> uh <O> one or two
words in Telugu </O> in <{> <[> in Telugu we use it </[>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#78:1:A>
 <[> Kannada influence </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#79:1:B>
 Yes <,> so that dialectical differences you find in every
language <,> and otherwise the language cannot survive <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#80:1:A>
 Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#81:1:A>
 You heard some time ago as you made it into request

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#82:1:B>
 But what exactly is Indian English <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#83:1:B>
 <w> I'm </w> unable to ring with that <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#84:1:A>
 Yes of course <,> this is how from his speech we would gain
<,> uh I think <O> one word </O> but to uh <,> we can try and analyse <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#85:1:A>
 Indian English <,,> I think <,> it is more <,> identifiable based
on literature other than languages <,> <{> <[> uh I know <,,> correct

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#86:1:B>
 <[> Uh I know </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#87:1:B>
 Yeah <w> that's </w> my point

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#88:1:A>
 As far as language is concerned <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> we cannot
find much difference <,> except this latest information that are going on
there in <,> in England or in American <,> whose mother tongue is English
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#89:1:A>
 Basically the vocabulary <,> grammar part and all those things <}>
<-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> remain <,> constant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#90:1:A>
 Yet even in those things <,> there may be some slight changes
because <,,> their mother tongue is uh <,> <{> <[> English </[> and they are
authorised to bring changes <,> depending upon the daily usage <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#91:1:B>
 <[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#92:1:B>
 <[> English </[> </{>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#93:1:A>
 Whereas it is our cultivated language <,> foreign language <,>
we are not authorised to bring <,> changes in grammar and all those things

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#94:1:A>
 <w> That's </w> why <,> we remain as we were <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#95:1:A>
 Where did you get those <,> uh wood laws entry <,> the grammar
vocabulary and all those things <,> were uh <,> almost all standardised in a
particular way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#96:1:A>
 Still we carry on those things <,> without bringing any <,> uh
latest changes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#97:1:A>
 As far as the language is concerned <w> that's </w> true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#98:1:A>
 But <,> in my opinion <,> Indian English differs completely <,,> in
a way in all literature <,> Indo-Anglican literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#99:1:A>
 That makes all the difference <,,> uh about this <.> Ind </.>
Indian English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#100:1:A>
 Because <,> it cannnot survive without uh literature of course <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#101:1:B>
 What I think is <,,> spoken English

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#102:1:A>
 If someone has uh gradual <?> tone </?> in his speech

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#103:1:B>
 That spoken English

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#104:1:A>
 As far as spoken English

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#105:1:B>
 Spoken English accent will be different <,> some new words
might have come <,,> some of the Indianism might have come in there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#106:1:B>
 But basically <,> English language as it is <,,> I don't think we
can go for transform very much to, branding of Indian English <,> as much as
we brand American English

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#107:1:A>
 American English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#108:1:A>
 There is much difference in American

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#109:1:B>
 Because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts <,>
they changed it

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#110:1:A>
 Intentionally they did it <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#111:1:B>
 Uhm <,> I mean they created their own dictionary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#112:1:B>
 Means they don't like to call it an American English they want to
call it American language

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#113:1:A>
 American language <,>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#114:1:B>
 But uh <,> <.> i </.> in America also they have various kinds
of influence Spanish language you know mean the Negroes going they have their
own kind of accent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#115:1:B>
 So <,> even there the difference is there but uh they are
identified themselves with American language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#116:1:B>
 That way if compared to that <,,> I don't find anything <,,> uh
very much significant in Indian <,> English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#117:1:B>
 Uh I think Indians pronounce or <,> the accent of Indians <,,> are
much better than the French men speaking English <,> or <{> <[> right yet
</[> speaking English <,>

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#118:1:A>
 <[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#119:1:B>
 But in the African continent <,,> there is a specific <,> uh
influence of their own language and their own accent kind of English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#120:1:B>
 If you read uh <,> article in English novels <,,> you find that
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#121:1:B>
 But in India <,,> I don't think it has gone to that extent to
brand the Indian English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#122:1:B>
 May be I don't know anything

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#123:1:A>
 Eh no no <,> you are correct totally correct <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#124:1:A>
 What <w> I'm </w> asking is <,,> <w> there's </w> no much <,> uh
difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and
all those things are concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#125:1:A>
 We can't find any difference <,> between English English and the
Indian English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#126:1:A>
 But Indian <}> <-> English </-> <=> English </=> </}> can claim to
be different <,> can claim to be unique <,> basically <,> literature that is
these brought out from here <,> because the whole Indo-Anglican literature is
based <,> mainly <,> <{> <[> of course <,> mainly I have stressed <,> on the
Indian tradition Indian things Indian culture <,> over whatever <,> a piece
of creative creative literature <,> that uh so called Indo- Anglican
literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be <,>
basically

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#127:1:B>
 <[> Of course </[> </{>

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#128:1:B>
 But there also you have to differentiate uh <,,> see if a
person like Naipaul

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#129:1:A>
 Uhm

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#130:1:B>
 Nobody call him like <,> language might have <,> very much
lived in the west

<$A>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#131:1:A>
 Yes

<$B>
 <ICE-IND:S1A-015#132:1:B>
 Then take another Manohar Mazumdar <,> very much lived in the
<}> <-> western </-> <+> west </+> </}> and his writing developing means you
don't find much of the Indianism <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#133:1:B>
 Though he treats Indian <,,> uh characters in <,> <{1> <[1> Indian
English <,,> but his language and the flow of language <,,> I mean you don't
find <,> uh anything convertible like R K Narayan <,> <{2> <[2> ah <,> means
means they like you let a autobiography of Nehru <,> and autobiography of
Gandhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#134:1:B>
 There is a vast difference <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-015#135:1:B>
 <w> Nehru's </w> style is something very <,> naturally flowing <,>
</I>
