THE APPROACH TO the Eighth Plan by the newly constituted Planning
Commission and the National Front Government seems to have so many facets
that it is unclear what will be the eventual outcome and how the Planning
Commission will be finalising the Approach Paper and determining the
content of the Plan outlay.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#3:1>
From the observations of Mr. Ramakrishna Hegde, Vice Chairman of
the Planning Commission and its members and those of the Prime Minister Mr.
V. P. Singh, the Finance Minister, Mr. Madhu Dandavate, and the Industry
Minister, Mr. Ajit Singh, it would appear that the accent would be on faster
generation of employment with the same doses of inputs and decentralised
planning which will make available to the weaker sections, particularly
those in the semi-urban and rural areas, the fruits of developmental
expenditure to a greater extent than hitherto.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#4:1>
The draft Approach Paper has understandably not given any indication
of the outlays and the areas of development, physical targets and growth
rates as it is felt that numbers have no relevance, nor do quantification
of inputs and outputs, and what really matters is a significant improvement
in the lot of the common man, eradication of poverty and providing work
for every able bodied person.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#5:1>
The Prime Minister has cautioned the Planning Commission about
unplanned decentralisation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#6:1>
He has also suggested that there should be some quantification of
goals so that it will be possible to know what is being done and what should
be the progress in the desired directions.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#7:1>
The Finance Minister, for his part, is keen on securing a growth rate
which will ensure a bigger national cake which could be shared equitably by
all sections of the population and the desired objective of disbursed incomes
and development of small and cottage industries can also be realised.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#8:1>
Mr. Ajit Singh, the Union Minister for Industry, is anxious that there
should be larger investments, faster industrial development and spectacular
growth in export earnings even while bringing about dispersed development.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-006#9:1>
What is the import of these observations, what will be the content
of the Eighth Plan and what should be its size?

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#10:1>
No clear answers to these questions are available as yet though it is
expected that a picture will emerge after the availability of resources had
been determined and the apparatus required for decentralised planning had
been created.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#11:1>
Even in respect of decentralised planning, it is not as if there had
been no thinking in this regard earlier.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#12:1>
The development of community blocks, formation of district centres
or formulation of regional plan schemes have been thought of but the
compulsion to achieve growth in some directions and the differing emphasis
on plan implementation had led to the neglect of agricultural, industrial or
infrastructural development at various times in the different Plans.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#13:1>
The need to achieve faster progress in some sectors at particular
stages had obviously led to uncoordinated plan implementation in the face
of inadequacy of resources.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#14:1>
But there is no doubt that impressive progress has been made in many
directions in nearly four decades of Planning.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#15:1>
If one looks at the levels of production and performance in earlier
years, it will be readily recognised that the additions to irrigated area,
generating capacity or industrial capability have been truly remarkable.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#16:1>
But the lack of adequate emphasis on development of agricultural
sector in the Second, Third and Fourth Plan periods and the slackening pace
of development of energy sources had a distorting effect on regional progress
and inequitable distribution of the benefits of the growth in the gross
domestic product.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#17:1>
With the thrust to agricultural production in the last two years
of the Seventh Plan, a sustained growth in industrial production with the
public sector enterprises giving a better account of themselves and
buoyancy in the capi tal and stock markers enabling rapid expansion of the
private industrial sector, the economy is now in much better shape than it
has been at any time in the recent past.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#18:1>
However, the question may well be asked whether the
mobilisa-tion of resources has been attempted in a noninflationary
manner and heavy doses of deficit financing have not accentuated pressures on
prices.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#19:1>
Also, the huge trade deficits in the 1980s have resulted in a large
increase in external indebtedness and debt servicing obligations now
absorb over 24 per cent of the total export earnings.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#20:1>
If inflationary financing is to be avoided and the Plan outlay
restricted to resources in sight and those that can be quantified over a
period, the aggregate Plan outlay may not be very impressive.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#21:1>
However, even a smaller outlay can be more effective if, as the
Prime Minister has observed, the existing assets are utilised more
purposefully and there is no wasteful use of resources or leakage and the
priorities are wisely conceived.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#22:1>
But the planners will have difficulty in determining the allocations
as it is now recognised that heavy investment will have to be made in the
creation of capacity for power generation, oil exploration and exploita
tion, development of railway facilities, increasing coal raisings,
modernising steel plants, expeditious implementation of fertilizer
projects, irrigation schemes and development of agriculture.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#23:1>
The impression is sought to be given that investment in the rural
sector has not been sizable and 50 per cent of the total Plan outlay will
have to be earmarked for benefiting the rural areas in 1990-95.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#24:1>
Actually, the outlay on irrigation schemes, minor irrigation
projects, rural electrification, energisation of pumpsets, development of
roads, construction of warehouses and the execution of welfare programmes and
family planning are absorbing close to half the total outlay.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#25:1>
What is required is greater emphasis on these schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#26:1>
A sharp rise in agricultural production from the irrigated and
rainfed areas and the development of food processing industries by themselves
will genrate larger employment and an improvement in incomes and standards of
living of the rural population.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#27:1>
It has also to be ensured that regional imbalances are rectified
with greater attention to the weaknesses in the agricultural sector in the
Eastern region, power shortage in the Southern region and equitable
distribution of scarce fossil fuel resources especially natural gas.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#28:1>
There will of course have to be a determined bid to improve the
balance of payments with a contraction of the trade deficit and an
increase in the invisible receipts.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#29:1>
The Union Minister for Commerce, Mr. Arun Nehru, has emphasised the
need for raising exports more impressively and eschewing unwanted imports in
such a way that the trade deficit does not continue to be worrisome.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#30:1>
The planners and the Government have thus to ensure that economic
growth is at a faster rate with broad, specific goals and the increase in
national income is more meaningful for the lower income groups and those
below the poverty line. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#32:1>
<w> INDIA'S </w> DECISION TO sign the Basle Convention to control
the movement of hazardous wastes reflects its awareness of the threat
posed to health, safety and environment by the widely prevailing and callous
indifference to the handling and disposal of lethal rubbish.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#33:1>
The most menacing of such wastes is nuclear material and it is
therefore surprising that it is not included among the 47 categories of
wastes from hazardous industries covered by the Convention.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#34:1>
The Convention also does not provide for payment of compensation for
damage resulting from the movement of hazardous wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#35:1>
India and the other 115 countries which had earlier adopted the draft
convention should insist on the removal of such lacunae before they sign the
convention when it is finalised.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#36:1>
Coverage of nuclear waste is vitally important as its exclusion would
make the prohibition of the export of hazardous wastes provided for in the
Convention virtually meaningless since at present the smaller non-nuclear
countries are being exposed to the mercies of nuclear powers using them as
dumping grounds in all manner of ways.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#37:1>
What makes the scene very chilling is that the neighbours of the
nuclear powers are often not even aware of what is going on because of the
highly organised conspiracy of secrecy surrounding nucelar waste dumping.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#38:1>
According to one estimate, 70,000 tonnes of nuclear wastes were
dumped into the sea by U.K. until 1980, with the world living in blissful
ignorance of it until the U.K. National Union of Seamen boycotted the
activity.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#39:1>
The bulldozing of nuclear waste from a closed uranium processing
facility at Canonsburg near Pittsburgh, U.S. led in 1980 to the discovery
that the incidence of leukaemia in the town was as high as 67 in just 45
houses in one street. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-006#40:1>
The record of the richer countries in the matter of disposal of
non-nuclear toxic wastes is just as outrageous.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#41:1>
Seals died in large numbers in North Sea in 1988 because of the
dumping of huge quantities of chemical pollutants.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#42:1>
In 1987, shipments of the highly toxical chemical waste,
polychlorinated biphenyls, handled by an Italian waste dispoal firm in
collusion with a local landowner were about to be dumped in Nigeria.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#43:1>
But the Nigerian Government woke up to what was going on and
ordered the removal of the drums of the chemical which had landed in the
country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#44:1>
The exclusion of nuclear wastes from its coverage by the Basle
Convention will only give rise to suspi<l.cions about an unwillingness to
take note of the ways of the nuclear powers and discipline them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#45:1>
Though it is too much to hope that just the adoption of an
international convention will put an end to the littering of the planet by
the nuclear powers, nothing should stop countries like India from imparting
to the Convention an awareness of the responsibility of the industrial
nations in fouling the global environment. </p> </I>

THE VISHWA HINDU <w> Parishad's </w> decision to defer its plan
to commence the construction of the Rama temple, slated for February 14, in
response to the appeal of the Prime Minister, Mr. V. P. Singh, gives the
country some breathing space in what is clearly a very troubled period.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#48:2>
If indeed the VHP had gone ahead with its plan, it would have
witnessed another painful bout of inter-communal tensions and violence.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#49:2>
The Prime Minister did the right thing in couching his appeal to
the VHP to defer its programme in terms of the fact that the country was
at a sensitive juncture.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#50:2>
There is indeed a national security dimension to the entire Ayodhya
issue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#51:2>
Political forces in Pakistan which are now building up an
international campaign on the basis of the Kashmir developments and are
attempting to rally sentiments in the Islamic world against India would be
only too happy to seize upon the potential in a communally charged situation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#52:2>
The episode involving the <indig> Shilanyas </indig> ceremony
which had triggered a chain of communal riots last November - - and had
brought back to life one of the most sordid features of Indian political
history - - evoked a sharp reaction from across the border.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#53:2>
The VHP and like minded organisations should recognise the unwisdom
of preempting the judicial process.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#54:2>
They should resist the temptation of retreating into hair-spitting
arguments as to whether the proposed site is disputed or not and should
in the interest of communal harmony, go a step further to abjure their
periodically raised politically-timed moves to begin construction work on the
foundation laid last November.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#55:2>
It is to be noted that the <w> VHP's </w> response to the Prime <w>
Minister's </w> appeal still remains in the realm of <quote> " let us wait
and see" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#56:2>
There is no categorical assurance that the programme has been
deferred for all the four months sought by the Prime Minister in which time
the proposed committee is to begin its search for a solution.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#57:2>
In fact, it was said that the VHP action committee would meet in
Ayodhya on February 13 and 14 to decide the future course of action on the
commencement of the construction work.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#58:2>
Evidently, although the VHP has grudgingly accepted the <quote> "
political will" </quote> of the new Government to find a solution to the
complex issue, it is still not willing to commit itself to the results of the
process that the Government has initiated.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#59:2>
The VHP general secretary, Mr. Ashok Singhal, has said that the
proposed committee is only a mediatory body and that the VHP would not
abide by any of its decisions.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#60:2>
This is a cynical response to a sincere attempt to find a way out of
the stalemate on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#61:2>
For the present, the country certainly has been saved from the
consequences of the deterioration of the political atmosphere that would have
set in had the VHP stuck to its date.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#62:2>
The toll in human lives taken by the Ayodhya issue and the
communal violence in the aftermath of the <indig> Shilanyas </indig>
processions holds a grim warning that tactics employed by the VHP and its ilk
have drastic consequences that the nation can ill afford.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#63:2>
Therefore, the issue cannot be viewed only in terms of the rights and
wrongs or the validity of the respective historical claims in the interim
period until a solution satisfactory to both the communities is arrived at.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#64:2>
There would necessarily have to be a total freeze on any kind of
political or communal activity in aid of the respective claims in order to
stave off any further deterioration in the atmosphere between the two
communities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-006#65:2>
The proposed committee announced by the Government has a
difficult task ahead.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#66:2>
The issue has indeed defied unravelling in the recent period with
various mediatory attempts having petered out.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#67:2>
Several distinguished historians have pointed out that a review of
the historical evidence suggests that the claims made by the Hindu and the
Muslim communal groups can find no sanction from history.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#68:2>
It would indeed be a difficult business for the courts or any
mediatory panel to determine the prior antiquity of the respective shrines.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#69:2>
They have correctly pointed out that the entire issue would in turn
raise the question of the limits to the logic of restoration of religious
sites.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#70:2>
<quote> " How far back do we go?

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#71:2>
Can we push this to the restoration of Buddhist and Jain monuments
destroyed by Hindus?

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#72:2>
Or of pre-Hindu animist shrines?" </quote> these historians have
asked.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#73:2>
It must also be remembered that a decision on the Babri Masjid issue
would form a precedent for the similarly disputed shrines elsewhere in the
country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-006#74:2>
Thus it would be best for the committee to consider seriously the
suggestion to declare the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid complex a
national monument. </p> </I>
