<ICE-IND:S1A-085#1:1:A>
How was the day today <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#2:1:B>
For me not very well <,> <w> it's </w> been like usual <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#3:1:A>
What happened <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#4:1:B>
Today also I faced the same problem with tenth standard <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#5:1:A>
What was the problem <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#6:1:B>
These children though they are in tenth standard <,> they are
not very serious about their studies <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#7:1:B>
They keep on talking <,,> mostly the back benchers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#8:1:B>
And there are some students who come from the <,> <.> aff </.>
influential families <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> they also trouble the others <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#9:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#10:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#11:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#12:1:B>
Actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#13:1:B>
These children because they have their <,> business and all that
they are not more interested <{> <[> in studies </[> and all that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#14:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#15:1:A>
They <{> <[> might be thinking that </[> we carry the same
business

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#16:1:B>
<[> Keep on troubling yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#17:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#18:1:B>
So no need for study actually <w> I've </w> heard one of the boy no
<,> actually he said that <,> <quote> sir I have my <w> father's </w>
business <,> I just come here <,> <{> <[> see <,> to pass my time </quote>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#19:1:A>
<[> See </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#20:1:A>
Yes <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#21:1:B>
So he is troubling the others <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#22:1:A>
Yeah <,> <{> <[> their parents should be </[> called but

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#23:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> why the others </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#24:1:A>
The parent should be called and

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#25:1:B>
Actually now we are going to call the parents you know after
the first unit test result <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> so <w> we'll </w> call them
<w> we'll </w> talk with them <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#26:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#27:1:A>
Their parents come and sign the results no <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#28:1:B>
Ah <{1> <[1> actually the parents no </[1> we have not still
given

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#29:1:B>
But the students <,,> for they have been troubling not only me
other teachers also lot of time

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#30:1:B>
So <,> from them we had taken in <{> <-> written </-> <+> writing
</+> </{> <,> that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they
did the same thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#31:1:B>
But still we find their behaviour the same way

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#32:1:B>
No change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#33:1:B>
They themselves have given in <{> <-> written </-> <+> writing </+>
</{> <,> when we reported to <,> sir and madam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#34:1:B>
They said that okay <quote> we are giving in writing that <w> we'll
</w> not trouble any teacher <w> we'll </w> be serious about our studies
</quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#35:1:B>
But the same thing we find <,> <{2> <[2> still they are troubling
</[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#36:1:A>
<[1> Or they would be given by </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#37:1:A>
<[2> Even I face </[2> </{2> the same problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#38:1:A>
When I punish the student their parents come and ask me <quote> why
you punished the student </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#39:1:A>
They don't want punishment to be given to their children <,> and
they don't

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#40:1:B>
<w> They'll </w> take the side of <{> <[> their children </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#41:1:A>
<[> And they want </[> </{> uh only benefit <,> means like
making them <,> uh improvements in their writings and

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#42:1:B>
Yeah actually when the child is <{> <[> doing something wrong
</[> then also you should not punish and uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#43:1:A>
<[> Yeah they should study </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#44:1:A>
Yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow <,>
marks

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#45:1:B>
Yeah actually no they

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#46:1:A>
They won't study <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#47:1:B>
Because of the parents attitude no we find even the <{> <->
childrens </-> <+> children </+> </{> behave the same way

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#48:1:B>
The students when we try to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#49:1:A>
Yeah they take it lightly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#50:1:B>
Say something

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#51:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> it is </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#52:1:B>
<[> It is </[> </{> of their benefit they don't listen <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#53:1:A>
Yeah <,> benefit they don't <{> <[> understand </[> the
meaning of benefit I think <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#54:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#55:1:B>
Yeah actually now a days

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#56:1:A>
Keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#57:1:B>
Yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents
were not like this <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#58:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> first they used to ask </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#59:1:B>
<[> They used to say beat us </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#60:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#61:1:B>
But make the student

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#62:1:A>
Even I find so many <.> sa </.>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#63:1:B>
But now a days the parents have just become the opposite

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#64:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#65:1:B>
Now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing
something wrong <,> don't do anything <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#66:1:A>
Even now the now <{1> <[1> a days parents emphasise no </[1>
that my child is sick everytime <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> and he doesn't eat
properly <,> he <,> keeps on playing <,> if uh they will say this all <{2>
<[2> but they won't say </[2> that <,> <indig> ki </indig> <.> ma </.> make
him uh <,> beat him or make him <,> do whatever you want <,> never

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#67:1:B>
<[1> But they they have to pass </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#68:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#69:1:B>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#70:1:B>
Yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was
different

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#71:1:B>
During our time <,> our parents they used to <,> come and tell the
teacher

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#72:1:A>
Yeah we know how we have studied

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#73:1:B>
Yeah <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> but now today you find the situation
totally different

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#74:1:B>
The parents they encourage the children

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#75:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#76:1:A>
Encourage <{> <[> means they won't be </[> uh <,> looking at
what they are doing

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#77:1:A>
But if they have been

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#78:1:B>
<[> Not to be beaten </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#79:1:B>
In <{> <[> these things </[> only they are encouraging

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#80:1:A>
<[> If this happens no </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#81:1:A>
Teacher beats the child <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> they will come to
fight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#82:1:A>
They will come <}> <-> till </-> <+> to </+> </}> the Principal <,>
then <,> they have to

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#83:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#84:1:B>
Yeah <,> see we teacher have to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#85:1:A>
And every time <w> they've </w> to scold us <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#86:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> the thing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#87:1:A>
That is the problem with me also <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#88:1:B>
Even I face the same problem but I try to tackle it you know
with uh <w> I've </w> got some problems whenever I have <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#89:1:B>
Actually not in this earlier school no I had problems <,> like this
most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#90:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#91:1:B>
Become <,> since <w> I've </w> dealt successfully with some of
the children

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#92:1:B>
See if we love them <,> if <{> <[> we pamper a little </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#93:1:A>
<[> You had to do that <indig> na </indig> </[> </{> that is
yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#94:1:B>
No if we pamper them little

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#95:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#96:1:B>
But <,> sometimes no we have to go out of our way <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> for these childrens especially <,> though others they will think
that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them <,,> many
means whatever <,> at first they have not <{> <[> done home work </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#97:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#98:1:A>
<[> Some punishment is required </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#99:1:B>
No actually at first no for these children no we should not
give punishment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#100:1:B>
We should pamper them a lot

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#101:1:B>
<{> <[> Then try to make them </[> understand

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#102:1:A>
<[> Yeah because they understand </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#103:1:A>
Ah now <,> now

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#104:1:B>
Once they come closer to us no then only we understand

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#105:1:A>
Now in the tenth standard they are grown up

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#106:1:A>
They understand the meaning of punishment

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#107:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#108:1:A>
They feel <,> some shameful about that <{> <[> punishment
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#109:1:B>
<[> No </[> actually <w> I'll </w> tell you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#110:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#111:1:B>
They are not ashamed <w> I'll </w> tell you because once <,>
when we took <+> from </+> them in writing the next time they did the same
thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#112:1:B>
So when madam came to the class she punished the whole class <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#113:1:B>
And then means <,> to make them that whatever they are doing they
were standing on the bench to make ashamed <,> we send eighth standard
students just go and have a look at them

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#114:1:B>
And you know what was the remark of tenth standard <,> <w> what's
</w> to us let them come and see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#115:1:B>
Means that was their reaction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#116:1:B>
So they <{> <[> were not bothered </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#117:1:A>
<[> <O> Two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#118:1:B>
Yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard
students they came in class there <,> <{> <[> no reaction </[> they didn't
felt ashamed nothing like that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#119:1:A>
<[> In even my class </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#120:1:A>
Though they are small <,> they are very clever <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#121:1:A>
Clever in the sense <,> uh not in studies at all but

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#122:1:B>
Uh they <{> <[> are doing </[> co-curricular activities and
all that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#123:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#124:1:A>
Yeah beating and everything <,> and using <,> and abuses that
don't know what <,> they are saying sometimes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#125:1:B>
Actually <w> what's </w> the thing you know the parents they
don't respect the teacher <,> so the students <{> <[> also don't </[> respect

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#126:1:A>
<[> Yeah in our <.> cla </.> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#127:1:A>
Class I can make <{> <[> out what the parent might be
speaking </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#128:1:B>
<[> Because at time you see even the parents </[> </{> when
they speak about the teacher <,> in derogative manners

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#129:1:A>
Yeah yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#130:1:B>
So the children learns the same thing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#131:1:A>
Same thing <{> <[> and so </[> we have to <,,> just <,> shut
them and nothing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#132:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> the state </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#133:1:B>
Yeah now a days the situation has just become <,> so
different that uh <,> we have to bear even whatever they say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#134:1:A>
I never beat a student <,> never <,> in my whole life <w>
I've </w> never beat a single student <{> <[> but now when I came to </[>
third standard I can see <,> that uh <,> they are something different because
they are never means uh guided in a way <,> to how to behave <,> or how to
talk with a teacher atleast <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#135:1:A>
Whenever we are uh <,> saying something they <,> without thinking
they say out the words <,> now

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#136:1:B>
<[> Even I never beat </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#137:1:B>
Without thinking <{> <[> what </[> are the words

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#138:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#139:1:A>
Yeah and whatever <w> I've </w> written on the board they
take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what
is the answer for that <,> never <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#140:1:A>
But take <{1> <[1> out other meanings </[1> from that <,> means
how clever they are mean uh <,> means unwanted <{2> <[2> things </[2> they
are clever

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#141:1:B>
<[1> Other <O> one word </O> </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#142:1:B>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#143:1:B>
Yeah actually <w> that's </w> the thing <,> suppose <w>
they'll </w> always see <w> what's </w> the mistake teacher is doing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#144:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#145:1:B>
They pronounce <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#146:1:A>
<[> Not </[> </{> even that if that were

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#147:1:B>
Always they will be uh <,> <w> what's </w> the teacher <O>
one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#148:1:A>
I will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my
mistake <,> but they don't even take that much of <{> <[> pains to <O> one
word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#149:1:B>
<[> That is </[> </{> they try no <,> always they try

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#150:1:B>
Suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper <,> <w>
it's </w> not writing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#151:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#152:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#153:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> <w> it's </w> making sound </[> and all they

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#154:1:B>
<[> <w> It's </w> a funny idea </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#155:1:B>
Yeah they will start laughing and all that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#156:1:A>
Yeah even we feel <O> one word </O> <,> they will keep on
saying

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#157:1:B>
They are very particular about these things <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#158:1:B>
When you ask them question the whole class

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#159:1:A>
Never <,> even I can make out <,> only few students <,> <{1>
<[1> yeah <,> those coming in five <{> <[> firstly </[> I think <,> those
only will give the answers everytime ahn <,> <{2> <[2> yeah <,> and even
during inspection and all they only are very active and particular

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#160:1:A>
Their parents do come and meet me <,> but <,> <{3> <[3> yeah <,>
uh about others maximum I can find that <,> I can give the examples <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#161:1:A>
These students never <,> never bothered

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#162:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#163:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#166:1:B>
Yeah actually even I <O> two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#167:1:A>
But their parents whenever I beat them <,> the parents came
and ask me <,> purposely why <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#168:1:A>
And <{> <[> the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#169:1:B>
<[> Even for me the other teachers </[> </{> first only they
warned me <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> that don't beat these these these child <,>
because as <w> I'm </w> new no they told me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#170:1:B>
Because if you will beat even if they have done something <{> <[>
wrong </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#171:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#172:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{> we feel about them no something

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#173:1:B>
No action will be taken against that you will be <+> the </+>
person to be blamed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#174:1:B>
So <{> <[> the parents will come and they will blame you only </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#175:1:A>
<[> Blames means uh we have to take the blame </[> </{>
sometimes

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#176:1:A>
We have to take the blame on that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#177:1:A>
I feel about that only

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#178:1:B>
Not sometime most of the time <{> <[> we have to take </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#179:1:A>
<[> Most of the time </[> </{> means yes that is true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#180:1:A>
But uh sometime for these students also we feel <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> even madam has told me that some students are such <,> you don't beat
them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#181:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#182:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#183:1:A>
But I feel somewhere <,> if these are to be guided just now
<,> this is the way

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#184:1:B>
See I had a show-down with <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> one of the
boy no tenth standard

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#185:1:B>
I had a show-down

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#186:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#187:1:A>
Now tenth is a

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#188:1:B>
And then <{1> <[1> I told </[1> them okay <{2> <[2> because
</[2> he argued with me like anything as I was <,> means equal to him

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#189:1:A>
<[1> <O> One word </O> </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#190:1:A>
<[2> <O> One word </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#191:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#192:1:B>
That way he argued with me <,> so I said I will not enter the
class <,> till he says sorry to me

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#193:1:B>
I came back I didn't went to that class <,> for two three days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#194:1:B>
Then madam interfered <,> that boy was called and he said sorry

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#195:1:B>
Even when he said sorry he was crying <,> then I told him <,> I
made him understand see <w> I'm </w> not happy making you say sorry to me

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#196:1:B>
<w> That's </w> not the thing but you should means respect me as a
teacher

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#197:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> elder to you <,> <w> I'm </w> not equal to you

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#198:1:B>
You can't talk me just like you talk to your friends <,> or your
younger ones

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#199:1:B>
You can't talk to a teacher like that way

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#200:1:B>
So I made him understand <,> <{> <[> <indig> nahi </indig> <,>
that

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#201:1:B>
But now a days I find him <,> but it has <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#202:1:A>
<[> <indig> Nahi </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#203:1:A>
Don't speak that way but <,> <{> <[> atleast he should be
clever </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#204:1:B>
<[> No actually what the thing you know </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#205:1:A>
Somewhere

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#206:1:B>
You know what the student they tell no <,> at home they don't
treat us like this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#207:1:B>
If we shout at him no means <,> this very particular boy when I
shouted at him no <,> to other teacher he said <quote> at home nobody shouts
at me </quote> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#208:1:A>
So what

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#209:1:B>
That means we have to behave just the way their parents
behave at home

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#210:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> parents behave </[> and uh parents should come
to know

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#211:1:B>
<[> They expect the same behaviour </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#212:1:B>
But how can we behave that way

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#213:1:A>
You would have called the parents <,> you would have called
the parents <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#214:1:B>
No <{1> <[1> actually he himself </[1> said sorry <{2> <[2>
<O> one word </O> actually I find </[2> yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#215:1:A>
<[1> Because this is not proper </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#216:1:A>
<[2> But we should actually </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#217:1:B>
Now a days I find him <,> little bit <O> one word </O> he
scores he pays attention <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#218:1:A>
Yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we <{> <[> said that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#219:1:B>
<[> So it is </[> </{> yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#220:1:A>
We can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour <,>
<{> <[> yeah <,> we have to deal with you have to make make them understand
and <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#221:1:A>
But in our class what happens being a third standard <{> <[> we
<O> one word </O> should guide </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#222:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#223:1:B>
<[> No actually no </[> </{> there has to be a communication
with the students and the teacher <,> I I find that I have a gap <,> with my
students <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#224:1:A>
Yeah because

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#225:1:B>
I cannot have a proper communication with them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#226:1:A>
That is true <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#227:1:B>
<w> That's </w> why no we can't understand

<ICE-IND:S1A-085#228:1:B>
Neither they understand me and I also can't understand them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#229:1:A>
That happens with every <{> <[> teacher and yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-085#230:1:B>
<[> Yeah <w> that's </w> </[> </{> the thing and if once we
have this no full <,> communication with one other <,> two way communication
<,> then only we can say that </I>
