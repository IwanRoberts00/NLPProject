<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#3:1>
<it> Hippocratis, the ancient Greek physician, was well known for
his primary concern for <w> man's </w> health and welfare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#4:1>
All medical graduates, about to receive their degree, even today take
the famous Hippocratic oath to serve mankind selflessly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#5:1>
But in practice the priorities of doctors, medical students and even
those who would be medical students are far removed from those of this Greek
physician.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#6:1>
The pull of high-tech medicine and treatment and its money-spinning
potentials is too strong to resist.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#7:1>
Are they even aware, asks VIMAL BALASUBRAHMANYAN, that health care can
minimise the need for medical treatment and check the spread of diseases ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#8:1>
And that they, as doctors, can play a leading role in this direction?
</it> </p> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#9:1>
<bold> It </bold> could well be a sobering truth for a young
<mention> MBBS </mention> aspirant to learn that cholera in England was
controlled long before the cholera vibrio was identified under the microscope
and much before anything like an anti-cholera vaccine was thought about.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#10:1>
The incidence of tuberculosis in UK had started declining much before
streptomycin was discoverd or the BCG vaccination invented.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#11:1>
And the killer diseases, which continue to ravage <mention> Third
World </mention> countries, were brought under control in the West not
because of advances in medical science but as a result of environmental
hygiene, better food and housing, which came as a result of a rise in living
standards. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#12:1>
Just as the diseases of poverty can be controlled by prevention,
so too can the diseases of affluence, now prevalent in the developed world -
- through changes in lifestyle and by the control of environmental factors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#13:1>
This is not to deny the relevance and importance of the curative role
of medicine.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#14:1>
But the fact is that this role is only of marginal importance in the
promotion and maintenance of good health conditions in a country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#15:1>
In 1976, Dr Thomas McKeown, professor of Social Medicine at the
University of Birmingham, published a rather controversial paper in a medical
journal.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#16:1>
In it he demonstrated, with irrefutable statistics, that health
conditions in 18th century England had improved not because of the
contributions of the medical profession but because of improved nutrition and
hygiene and the availability of contraception.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#17:1>
Later enlarged and published as a book in 1979, Dr <w> McKeown's </w>
<it> The Role of Medicine </it> is even today regarded as a pioneering
contribution to the area of medical sociology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#18:1>
It is considered all the more significant because it comes from a
member of the medical profession itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#19:1>
<it> Who cares for medical sociology </it> ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#20:1>
Unfortunately, a typical class twelfth student, <}> <-> swotting </->
<+> swetting </+> </}> for the joint entrance exam and hoping to make it to a
medical college, is unlikely to be advised by anyone to thumb through a book
like <it> <mention> The Role of Medicine </it> </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#21:1>
Nor is he / she likely to have heard of Ivan <w> Illich's </w> even
more forthright and devastating critique, <it> <mention> The Limits of
Medicine </mention> </it> , whose opening sentence reads : <quote> " The
medical establishment has become a major threat to health." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#22:1>
( The word <foreign> <quote> ` iatrogenesis' </quote> </foreign> ,
meaning diseases caused by medical intervention, has entered the common
vocabulary mainly because of Illich.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#23:1>
And it is perfectly possible that after completing
five-and-a-half gruelling years of medical education, the young intern not
only may not have read either of these books, but could be blissfully unaware
that there even exists such a field of study and research called medical
sociology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#24:1>
This is a real pity because health and disease are very much rooted
in social, economic and political factors, and are not merely a question of
disease-causing organisms being attacked by a formidable combination of
drugs, doctors and hospitals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#25:1>
When medicine is taught and studied in isolation as a ` science'
unconnected with the humanities, the inevitable result is the flawed and
often unethical practice it has become today.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#26:1>
Now health-care is a pricy commodity to be sold by health <quote > `
technologists' </quote> to those who can afford its exorbitant costs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#27:1>
<h> <it> Two ends of a stick : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#28:1>
This is not a difficult issue for taking sides if one happens to be
at the receiving end of the health-care system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#29:1>
However, the same critique to which a ` consumer' would be receptive
may be quite unpalatable to one who is at the dispensing end.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#30:1>
As a patient you may be very keen to understand all about the
politics of health.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#31:1>
As a doctor ( or an aspiring medico ) would you be equally
responsive?

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#32:1>
This is the crucial question.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#33:1>
If you are the sort who would like to be aware of what exactly are
the faults of the system you plan to join, and what you as a doctor could do
towards setting it right, then taking sides would present no dilemma, at
least at the theoretical level. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#34:1>
Where the problem really lies is in deciding how to go about
changing the system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#35:1>
The solution is a complex one, and I personally have no complete
answers to it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#36:1>
But, as I see it, understanding the system, and looking at it from an
alternative viewpoint, is the first step towards changing it, and even daring
to take this first step could be regarded as a major advance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#37:1>
Let us begin by recognising the issue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#38:1>
<h> <it> What they don't teach at the medical college: </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#39:1>
Today, some of us because of our exposure to various writings by
social scientists, have become conscious of the socio-political dimensions of
health.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#40:1>
Some of us have <O> <&> page </&> 60 </O> had the opportunity to
interact with doctors in the <quote> ` rational health' </quote> movement who
are trying to raise awareness among the public and influence the government
to make its health policy more relevant to the needs of the people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#41:1>
The experience of the socialist countries has proved to us that the
health standards of a country, even when it has limited resources, can be
dramatically raised by simple public health measures and social reforms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#42:1>
And both these need political will and not sophisticated medical
technology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#43:1>
Doctors in activist health groups point out that none of this is
taught in medical colleges.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#44:1>
They also add that in their efforts to transform the health-care
system, the most powerful obstacles they encounter come from the medical
profession itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#45:1>
And one of the several reasons for this is the faulty orientation of
medical education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#46:1>
Last year, in a detailed critique of medical education, Dr N.H.
Antia of the Foundation for Research in Community Health had commented that
it is the <quote> " glamorous, high-tech and lucrative" </quote> specialities
which medical students aspire to take up, even though preventive and social
medicine are the real determinants of health.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#47:1>
This is a built-in distortion fostered by the curriculum, and it has
resulted in the commercialisation of health into what he calls an <quote> "
illness-business" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#48:1>
It is a distortion caused by a narrow emphasis on medicine as a
science and a technology with absolutely no components in a <w> doctor's </w>
training from the field of social sciences. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#49:1>
However, even an idealistic medical aspirant is bound to protest
that reforming the curriculum is beyond the scope of a student, and such an
argument would certainly be justified.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#50:1>
But only up to a point. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#51:1>
<h> <it> Educating ourselves : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#52:1>
There are many things we can do on our own to become better informed
and more sensitive and do not have to rest content with blaming everything on
the syllabus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#53:1>
For example, Dr Antia, in his recommendations for reorienting medical
education, has suggested the inclusion of health-related humanities which are
conspicuous by their absence in the medical curriculum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#54:1>
But syllabus reform takes time and it is open to young medical
students to read up on their own and arrive at a more <O> box : see below
</O> perceptive and enlightened understanding of the role of their profession
in relation to the society in which they live.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#55:1>
Such a broad approach to their subject can only make them better
doctors, so they really have nothing to lose. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#56:1>
One could emphasise here that some of the shortcomings in medical
education are common to all specialised science courses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#57:1>
In all the high-status professions to which science education leads,
the truly sensitive and socially responsible practitioners are the ones who
have a thorough understanding of the socio-political milieu in which they are
rooted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#58:1>
They derive this perception not from the prescribed textbooks, but by
staying alive to the realities around and by reading up on their own. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#59:1>
Unfortunately, right from the middle-school level, the ` high
achieving' student is encouraged to regard the humanities as infra dig and
unless the typical science student is <O> see box below </O> willing and able
to overcome this prejudice, he/she is more likely to end up perpetuating
rather than trans-forming the ills of the health-care system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#60:1>
<h> <it> Seek and find : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#61:1>
For a science student who acknowledges the need to have a better
understanding of social phenomena, and is genuinely seeking
information, fortunately there is plenty of material available.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#62:1>
The two classics by McKeown and Illich are fine for starters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#63:1>
Another is the ICMR-ICSSR joint document entitled <it> Healthy for
all: an alternative strategy </it> ( 1980), which could be a real eye-opener
for an Indian student.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#64:1>
Besides, there are a number of health-action and <w> people's </w>
science groups in this country which could prove to be rewarding sources of
information as well as inspiration since many of their members are themselves
practitioners of medicine.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#65:1>
To name three, there is the <mention> <indig> Kerala Sastra Sahitya
Parishad </indig> , the Medico-Friend Circle and the Voluntary Health
Association of India. </mention> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#66:1>
Of course, all this is only part of the first step of
understanding that there are issues related to health which are not merely
medical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#67:1>
This article has confined itself to the limited objective of drawing
attention to an area which simply does not figure during the cut-throat race
of trying to get admission into a medical college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#68:1>
<h> <it> Health for all or wealth for some ? </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#69:1>
To sum up, the distorted priorities in health policy are a direct
result of the over-riding importance given to high-tech medicine and its
money-spinning potential.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#70:1>
The status quo is maintained largely because of the medical <w>
profession's </w> own vested interests.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#71:1>
It may be an uncomfortable truth to face but truth it undoubtedly is.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#72:1>
When the WHO adopted <quote> ` Health for All' </quote> as its slogan
in the early 80s, it was very emphatic that what the world and especially the
developing countries need is not costly, five-star medical facilities, but
universally available primary health care. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#73:1>
This is hardly an exciting bit of information for the aspirant
doctor with high hopes of a glorious and financially rewarding medical
career.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#74:1>
In this, as in so many other issues, the question inevitably boils
down to; self-interest or public interest ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#75:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-033#77:1>
THERE IS ample evidence that by providing education and
health-care, preventive more than curative, improvement in the health
of our people can be achieved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#78:1>
<w> China's </w> performance in this direction is an eye-opener
for instance, over the past three decades infant mortality rate has dropped
from 90 to 32 per thousand live births; and life expectancy has increased
from 52.7 to 69.5.

<ICE-IND:W2B-033#79:1>
Sri Lanka too has reduced its under-five mortality rate from 101 per
thousand in 1960 to 35 in 1985.

<w> India's </w> figures for the same period read: underfive
mortality rate - - 152; infant mortality rate - - 96.
