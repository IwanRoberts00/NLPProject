<h> <bold> When The Sun Changes Its Spots </bold> </h> <&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#3:1>
<bold> The dark, mysterious patches on the <w> Sun's </w> surface are
known as <quote> ` sunspots' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#4:1>
But </*> calling it a <quote> ` spot' </quote> is an understatement as
the biggest one is 11 earths in diameter! </bold> </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#5:1>
<mention> <bold> A</bold> <smallcaps> LEOPARD</smallcaps> cannot
change its spots </mention> , they say.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#6:1>
But the Sun can and does.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#7:1>
Any increase in solar activity has a profound impact on human lives
and world events.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#8:1>
This is now fairly well established. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#9:1>
The sun is a fascinating and amazing star burning 60 <indig> crore
</indig> tonnes of hydrogen a second.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#10:1>
The sun, about 100 times the <w> Earth's </w> diameter ( 1.39 million
km as against 12,700 km dialmeter of the Earth), is 150 million km away
from our planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#11:1>
The surface temperature of the sun is about 6000 Kelvin and it may
be surprising to many that while it takes eight minutes for the <w> sun's
</w> energy to reach the earth, it takes a million years for it to go from
the <w> sun's </w> core to its surface. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#12:1>
The dark, mysterious patches on the <w> sun's </w> surface ( dark
because these are cooler, at 4000 degrees K, than the rest of the surface)
are called <quote> ` sunspots' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#13:1>
Calling a sunspot a <quote> ` spot' </quote> is a masterpiece of
understatement - - the biggest of these are equivalent to 11 earths in
diameter!

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#14:1>
These sunspots multiply every 11 years in a cycle from the solar
minimum to the solar maximum ( when the number of sunspot reaches a peak).
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#15:1>
During the solar maximum year, the sun has violent
convulsions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#16:1>
Huge storms erupt sudenly from the <w> sun's </w> upper reaches
lashing the solar system with X-rays and hurling dangerous debris towards
the earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#17:1>
Bright flashes called <quote> ` solar flares' </quote> erupt 800,000
kms into space.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#18:1>
Big bursts of luminous gas also rise thousands of kms above the <w>
sun's </w> surface. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#19:1>
The tidal wave of radiation, electric and magnetic fields and
high energy particles spiralling out from the sun causes radio blackouts and
electrical damage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#20:1>
On earth, radio communications are disrupted and transformers in
power lines overheart and short circuit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#21:1>
And the only redeeming features is the spectacular bright
displays of northern lights, or <quote> <foreign> ` Aurora Borealis'
</foreign> </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#22:1>
The sun demonstrates its awesome power with these fiery upheavals
accompanying the increased sunspot activity which bears a correlation with
terrestrial phenomena. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#23:1>
The sunspots discovered by Galileo in 1610, perform their
mysterious 11 year dance, appearing closer and closer to the <w> sun's </w>
equator and in greater numbers as each 11 year cycle progresses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#24:1>
The sunspot cycle has been blamed for misfortunes ranging from
erratic weather patterns to stock market crashes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#25:1>
Way back in 1801, William Herschel concluded that between 1650
and 1800 he could establish a connection between <O> sketch spread over
column two and three </O> sunspot frequency and crop yields.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#26:1>
Historical records reveal that during 1645 to 1715 with no clear 11
year cycles and little or no sunspots, the <quote> " Little Ice Age" </quote>
had set in.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#27:1>
A two to five per cent decrease in solar irradiance is enough to
trigger off another <mention> Ice Age </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#28:1>
In fact, a one-degree difference in ocean surface temperature is
sufficient to turn a calm into a storm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#29:1>
Rainfall in India oscillates with the 11-year cycle according to
a statistical analysis of rainfall over several parts of the country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#30:1>
Researchers have accumulated compelling evidence of the influence
of sunspots on terrestrial climate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#31:1>
Scientists contend that during solar flares, the electrically
charged particles spewed out may change the conductivity of the upper
atmosphere ( extending from 15 km to 24 km above the <w> earth's </w> surface ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#32:1>
The ozone structure in this <quote> ` stratosphere' </quote> can also
be attested due to solar ultraviolet radiation thereby affecting the weather.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#33:1>
The ozone layer traps and absorbs the <w> sun's </w> ultraviolet
radiation like a heat shield. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#34:1>
The relation between the sunspot cycles and the relative numbers
of sunspots for a period of 200 years from 1750 to 1950 AD depicts tellingly
the tantalising impact of the Sun on epochal events in world history.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#35:1>
The seven-year great war ( 1756- 1763) which catapulted Britain to
victory and vanquished Russia and France coincided with the solar maximum
period.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#36:1>
1789, year of the French Revolution, also witnessed sunspots passing
the peak.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#37:1>
Similarly, during high sunspots activity in 1805 and 1815 the
Battle of Trafalgar and Waterloo were fought respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#38:1>
The year 1857 was the historic year of the Sepoy Mutiny or the
First War of Indian Independence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#39:1>
This was the time when the sunspots were approaching the maximum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#40:1>
And before they could cross the solar maximum, the American Civil War
broke out, which lasted from 1861 to 1865.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#41:1>
The solar maximum year 1870 was also the year of a fierce war between
France and Germany. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#42:1>
Significantly enough, the intense sunspot activity in 1904-05
coincided with the historic encounter between Russia and Japan.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#43:1>
The four years of the First World War ( 1914-1918) constituted a
period of solar hyperactivity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#44:1>
As the sunspots began to wane in 1917, Russia was thrown in the
throes of a bloody Bolshevik revolution with farreaching consequences.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#45:1>
Enter the Second World War ( 1939-1945).

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#46:1>
World peace was endangered and the horror of Hitler enveloped the <w>
world's </w> nations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#47:1>
This period was also in the vice-like grip of the mysterious and
meancing sunspots. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#48:1>
In 1947, the year of Indian independence and also the
beginning of the end of the British Empire the relative number of sunspots
in this year was a staggering 160, the maximum since 1750, till that year.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#49:1>
Investigators have also drawn up a correlation between
sunspots and sanity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#50:1>
In 1943, N.J. Siberling suggested that the sunspots could affect
human psychology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#51:1>
The maximum sunspot years are characterised by increased number of
suicides, violent incidents, wars, tragic deaths of world leaders while the
minimum sunspot years have seen stable prices, a good economy, peace and
fairly normal human behaviour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#52:1>
Floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and other natural
calamities coincide with the solar maximum period.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#53:1>
People have found the link even in such unlikely places as
marriage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#54:1>
It has been found that the year 1979, marked by the <w> sun's </w>
hyperactivity, was also a year when a record number of marriages took
place! </p> <O> <&> author's name </&> <bold> D.K. Dixit </bold> </O> </I>

<bold> <}> <-> B </-> <+> By </+> </}> </bold> the time the
poachers finish laying the crude yet effective trap, it is almost sunset in
the sparse but vast forest of the Kenyan National Game Reserve.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#59:2>
Then they settle themselves behind some bushes, a kilometre off, to
wait for some returning wild elephants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#60:2>
Sure enough, an hour later, two elephants come sauntering down the
path.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#61:2>
The first pass without falling into the five foot deep pit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#62:2>
The second is not so lucky.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#63:2>
With a crashing sound she comes down over the pointed stakes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#64:2>
Some pierce into her belly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#65:2>
With her leg broken she is doomed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#66:2>
The poachers then close in.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#67:2>
Using high powered rifles they fell the first one too with three
bullets to its head.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#68:2>
By midnight the long curving ivory tusks are sawed off.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#69:2>
By sunrise the poachers are out of the Game Reserve, carrying with
them their prize possession, which will find a ready market among the illicit
ivory traders in Nairobi.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#70:2>
Two more majestic beasts fall prey to <w> man's </w> greed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#71:2>
The picture is the same elsewhere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#72:2>
In the Kaziranga Game Reserve, poachers are after the one-horned
rhino.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#73:2>
They will get fabulous amounts for the horn which is mistakenly
believed to have magical and medicinal values.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#74:2>
The days of <quote> " Moby Dick" </quote> are not yet over.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#75:2>
Hundreds of whales are systematically harpooned from trawlers in
the South Pacific.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#76:2>
Apart from the oil and bones, whale meat forms a large proportion of
the protein diet of the present Japanese. </p>

<p> <w> Today's </w> <indig> Maharajas </indig> may not go out with an
elaborate entourage these days on hunting expeditions they previously called
<quote> " sports" </quote> , but some of our wealthy citizens would not mind
the presence of a majestic skin of a spotted leopard on the centre table of
their grandly decorated sitting rooms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#77:2>
Most Western ladies still find it fashionable to wear a mink coat on
exclusive occasions - - the fur a sign of opulence rather than a protection
against cold. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#78:2>
<w> Man's </w> thoughtlessness nearly drove the tiger and the
mink to extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#79:2>
Widespread protection programmes saved them just in the nick of time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#80:2>
The African elephant and the rhino are on the endangered list.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#81:2>
If the killings go on unchecked, there may not be any more wild ones
30 years from now.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#82:2>
They will be confined to zoos and colourful <w> children's </w> story
books. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#83:2>
Others have not been <}> <-> to </-> <+> too </+> </}> lucky.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#84:2>
Take for instance the great auk - - sometimes called the penguin of
the Northern hemisphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#85:2>
This big flightless sea-bird was once abundant in the North
Atlantic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#86:2>
In 1534, the French explorer Jacques Cartier and his <w> ship's </w>
crew landed in Newfoundland.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#87:2>
They butchered some of the great auks for meat.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#88:2>
The feathers, they found, were ideal for pillows and cushions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#89:2>
The wave caught on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#90:2>
By 1840, feather and bird-meat collectors exterminated the bird.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#91:2>
It is now extinct. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#92:2>
And so is the dodo - - another flightless and awkward looking
bird that existed on the island of Mauritius.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#93:2>
Dutch and Portuguese sailors exterminated it by 1681.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#94:2>
The Maoris are guilty of yet another extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#95:2>
The giant ostrich-like bird, the moa, previously found in New Zealand
is no more.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#96:2>
It is an unending tale and a very long list bears testimony to the
fact that man has been directly responsible for exterminating hundreds of
birds and animals, either from lust or lack of understanding and knowledge
about the ecological consequences. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#97:2>
From 1600 A.D. biologists have been documenting plant, bird and
animal species scientifically.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#98:2>
Records since then show a grim and ominous picture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#99:2>
Out of the 4226 living species of mammals catalogued in 1620, it is
certain 46 have become extinct today while at least 152 are on the endangered
list.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#100:2>
Some of them are on the verge of extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#101:2>
After two decades we may not see the likes of the lovable giant
panda, the white snow leopard or the <O> photograph inset, tilted across
column two to five </O> Arabian oryx. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#102:2>
Birds are probably the hardest hit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#103:2>
Of the 8684 documented species, 112 have become extinct during the
last 350 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#104:2>
As many as 1666 are on the verge of extinction or extremely rare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#105:2>
Most orinthologists are sure the number of extinct species are
larger as some have not been sighted for over a decade, despite the presence
of thousands of avid bird watchers all over the world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#106:2>
We no longer will see the passenger pigeon, at one time probably the
most abundant species of bird ever documented.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#107:2>
During the middle of the 19th century its population was
estimated to be an incredible 3.5 billion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#108:2>
Yet hunting on a massive scale dwindled them very fast.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#109:2>
By the early part of this century, a few dozen were left.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#110:2>
The last surviving passenger pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoo on
September 1, 1914. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#111:2>
Desperate efforts are now under way to save others from imminent
extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#112:2>
A decade from now the whooping crane may not spread its seven foot
wings out to dry in the sun, or the Californian condor soar noiselessly in
the skies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#113:2>
Like them, the midget sized <w> Kirtland's </w> warbler may also
become extinct. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#114:2>
Apart from birds and animals, thousands of other <foreign> flora
and fauna </foreign> have become extinct or are on the verge of doing so.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#115:2>
The big ones get noticed - - the small, silent ones die out without
a whimper.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#116:2>
For example in a recent extensive survey in the rivers of Malaysia,
biologists failed to find even a single specimen of 144 species of tropical
fish out of the previously catalogued 266 types.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#117:2>
They are feared to be extinct.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#118:2>
It is estimated that about 40 per cent of all types of freshwater
snails may be already extinct or on the verge of extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#119:2>
Underwater life-forms are also getting depleted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#120:2>
Marine biologists feel that already a few hundred marine organisms
have become extinct out of the estimated 80,000 species - - a possibility
borne out by world-wide dwindling of coral reefs which harbour most of
them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#121:2>
Widespread deforestation is having its toll on plant life,
the worst hit are the tropical rain forests of the Amazon and South-East
Asia.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#122:2>
Destruction of the forest is not only exterminating rare plant
species, but also destroying the habitat of hundreds of species of birds,
insects, invertebrates and mammals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#123:2>
Botanists are alarmed at the ever increasing list of extinct algae,
fungi, flowering plants as also trees.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#124:2>
The phytoplankton ( a green microscopic sized algae) that abounds
in the oceans, supply life-giving oxygen to the atmosphere by
photosynthesis, like all plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#125:2>
There is strong evidence to suggest that like forests the
phytoplankton is also dwindling.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#126:2>
Less oxygen is therefore being pumped back into the atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#127:2>
What will happen if the phytoplankton become extinct? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#128:2>
Many factors are combining to cut down <w> earth's </w>
biodiversity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#129:2>
Hunting and killing of animals and birds or the felling of trees
faster than they can breed or grow is only one of the reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#130:2>
It is not the most important one.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#131:2>
Destruction of habitat due to encroachment and exploitation by man
is proving to be much more harmful.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#132:2>
It requires hundreds of years for life-forms to adapt themselves to
a new environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#133:2>
Ever increasing human population, increased urbanisation and
deforestation is taking its expected toll on other life-forms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#134:2>
Pollution, a legacy for <w> man's </w> unplanned industrial
growth is the other offender.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#135:2>
A complex interrelated network exists between lower life-forms
and higher ones.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#136:2>
Pollution strikes them both.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#137:2>
Man being a part of the complex chain has to be affected by the
declining biodiversity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#138:2>
It does not require too much far sightedness to gauge the
seriousness of the situation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#139:2>
Introduction of certain foreign species into new areas artificially
by man is sometimes proving to be a disaster.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#140:2>
In <w> Africa's </w> Lake Victoria, a large fish, the Nile perch,
has already multiplied uncontrollably and eaten up several species of smaller
fish which have gone extinct in the lake.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#141:2>
The perch was introduced to help develop local fisheries.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#142:2>
The mongoose, a native of Asia, was purposely introduced in the
sugar fields of the West Indies, to put a check on rats that harmed crops.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#143:2>
The mongoose not only wiped off the rats but also subsequently
exterminated several species of amphibians, reptiles and birds that
indirectly helped to reap a good harvest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#144:2>
Widespread eucalyptus plantations to help aforestation are
reportedly preventing or stunting the growth of other plants in the area.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#145:2>
A few more such inadvertent experiments may create more ecological
damage than solving them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-029#146:2>
At the rate we are going scientists estimate that within the
next 100 years we may lose about a million of the <}> <-> worlds </-> <+> <w>
world's </w> </+> </}> life-forms, which now stands documented at around two
million.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#147:2>
At present we are losing 5 to 10 per cent per decade.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#148:2>
As the highest life-form on earth it is up to us to preserve it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-029#149:2>
The question is are we already too late? </p> </I>
