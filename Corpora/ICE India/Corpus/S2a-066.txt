<ICE-IND:S2A-066#1:1:A>
Your honour this is a case <,,> where earlier the section was
applied was three nought seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#2:1:A>
But later on as the <,,> as the deceased <,,> as the <.> pa </.> as
the patient <-> was </-> uh <,,> succumbed to death <,,> it was altered into
three nought two <{> <[> IPC </[> Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#3:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#4:1:B>
Three nought seven to three nought

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#5:1:A>
Yes three nought two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#6:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#7:1:A>
Five <w> P W's </w> were examined by the prosecution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#8:1:A>
Five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#9:1:A>
But uh <,,> there is no eye witness in the whole case <,,> unh <,>
whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence <,> and three dying
declarations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#10:1:A>
As far as <-> Your </-> Your Honour dying declaration by the S C M
is concerned <,,> the the first dying declaration recorded by P W number one
S C M <,,> is concerned <,> there is no any endorsement of the Doctor <,,> to
the effect <,,> that the patient was in a <,> fit uh fit there was no
endorsement that the patient was uh <,> despondent is in a fit state <,> to
make a declaration <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#11:1:B>
Then

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#12:1:A>
Then as such it <?> wishes </?> <,,> it <?> wishes </?> the
whole dying declaration <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#13:1:B>
And then

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#14:1:A>
Ans as such it <?> wishes </?> <,,> it <?> wishes </?> the
whole dying declaration <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#15:1:A>
Because there is no endorsement of the Doctor to the effect <,,>
that <,> patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#16:1:B>
What number

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#17:1:A>
But uh <,,> inspite of the fact that uh <,,> no endorsement of
the doctor was obtained <,,> in evidence of P W number five <,,> on page uh
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#18:1:A>
Your honour <,> as far as <,> P W number three is concerned he is a
Doctor who has uh <,,> he who has uh performed the post mortem Your Honour

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#19:1:A>
And <,> what is relevant is at the time of the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#20:1:B>
<O> One word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#21:1:A>
Yes Your Honour it is very much necessary because <,,> as far
as the <w> Doctor's </w> endorsement is concerned Your Honour <,,> it is
relevant because at the time <,> when the declaration was made whether the
patient or the despondent was in a condition to <,,> condition to depose <,,>
is very much material

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#22:1:B>
But the Doctor is <{> <[> there </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#23:1:A>
<[> And </[> </{> and and <{> <[> and this this </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#24:1:B>
<[> When the doctor </[> </{> is present before them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#25:1:A>
Yes Your Honour

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#26:1:A>
And uh in this case <,> apart from whether the <.> con </.> patient
was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental
act as well Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#27:1:A>
A patient uh <,> if it is <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> incident
as alleged by the prosecution <,> then a patient can be under the mental
shock <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#28:1:B>
Yes proceed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#29:1:A>
And <,,> maybe due to one reason or the other his uh <,>
reasoning capacity <,,> may be affected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#30:1:A>
She may not be able to understand the questions which were put to
her <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#31:1:A>
The <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#32:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#33:1:A>
And uh here Your Honour <,> it is a clear case that uh <,,> it
is she herself <,> it is not the case that I had uh <,> gone and I had read
the message

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#34:1:A>
But <,> I fully aware Your Honour that it is a superficial when
injury everything is there <,> and Your Honour when uh even the <,,> I O also
here says that uh <,> Doctor was very much present <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#35:1:A>
Even the evidence of P W number four was also there that he was
very much present at the time <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#36:1:B>
Who <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#37:1:A>
Your honour I am relying upon the evidence of uh P W number
five upon two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#38:1:A>
Here he has said this since the Doctor was very much present <,,>
while the complaint was being recorded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#39:1:A>
Your Honour <,> I am <-> on a </-> <,> on the point that when the
<,> <.> pa </.> condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the
prosecution <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#40:1:A>
As far as Your Honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to
make a statement or not

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#41:1:B>
That of course

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#42:1:A>
Honour <,> my honest submission is this that the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#43:1:B>
Make it clear <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#44:1:C>
P W seven Doctor <@> Ram </@> <,,> who has first treated this
patient <,,> immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has
deposed in words that she was <}> <-> a <.> con </.> </-> <=> in a condition
</=> </}> to speak <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#45:1:A>
Your honour my question was that whether at the time of
admission he was in a condition to talk or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#46:1:A>
I am not on that point Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#47:1:B>
Doctor Miss <@> Maya </@>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#48:1:A>
Your Honour but I am not on that point Your Honour

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#49:1:A>
I am not uh <,> challenging the qualification of a Doctor Your
Honour I am also admitting that she is M S <,> but I am only on the point
Your Honour whether the time when the deposition was made <,,> it <w>
Doctor's </w> endorsement was necessary to that effect <,> and because <w>
doctor's </w> endorsement is not there Your Honour <,> a reasonable doubt can
be there Your Honour that he is not uh <,,> he may not be in a condition or
uh <,> or in a mental state <,,> to depose <,,> what she has deposed <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#50:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#51:1:B>
See the next point <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#52:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#53:1:A>
My next point is <,,> in this incident Your Honour as far as uh <,>
kerosene uh <,,> prosecution is silent as to from where the <,,> complainant
or <w> I'd </w> say deceased <,> has procured kerosene oil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#54:1:A>
Different versions are before the honourable court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#55:1:A>
According to F I R Your Honour <,,> F I R is silent on this point
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#56:1:A>
As far as <indig> Panchanama </indig> is concerned <,,> exhibit
eighteen <,,> that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#57:1:A>
As far as evidence of P W number three <,> uh two is concerned
mother of the <}> <-> <.> de </.> </-> <=> deceased </=> </}> <,,> but uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#58:1:B>
Number over six before the judge she has removed the

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#59:1:C>
Yes <,> it is exhibit <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#60:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <,> but as far as the evidence of P W number
two is concerned Your Honour <,> P W number two says <,,> that uh <,,> yeah I
am on page uh <,,> two upon two Your Honour <,,> that uh <,,> in anger she
poured kerosene on her person from a lamp <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#61:1:A>
And uh when I asked the same question in cross examination <,,> the
uh <,,> witness says I didn't state in my statement before the police that my
<,,> daughter <@> Binaka </@> poured kerosene from a lamp on her person <,,>
witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#62:1:B>
Then what is there <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#63:1:A>
That lamp was made of a glass bottle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#64:1:A>
That means she poured <.> herse </.> uh that means the <,> deceased
had poured kerosene oil <,,> uh from the <.> bot </.> uh <.> bot </.> glass
bottle made uh <,,> lamp made of a glass bottle

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#65:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#66:1:A>
And uh <,,> if that is so <,> then there is a <}> <-> <.>
contrad </.> </-> <=> contradiction </=> </}> between the two <,> that
whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or
from the <{> <[> lamp </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#67:1:B>
<[> As a fact </[> </{> what type of the bottle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#68:1:B>
It is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#69:1:A>
Exactly Your Honour but as far as the duty of the
investigation officer is concerned Your Honour <,> it is the duty to find out
that exactly from where it was procured Your Honour <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#70:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#71:1:A>
Thirdly Your Honour uh as far as

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#72:1:B>
Keep the rest free

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#73:1:A>
Yes Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#74:1:A>
Thirdly Your Honour I <,,> I would uh like to submit that as far as
the clothes <,,> under sealed the article under <indig> panchanama </indig>
is concerned Your Honour <,,> I am on that point <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#75:1:B>
Over this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#76:1:A>
Yes this point is over

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#77:1:B>
The kerosene is uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#78:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#79:1:B>
Bottle or a lamp

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#80:1:A>
So <,> yes Your Honour <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#81:1:C>
Article <,,> four <,,> article four <,> before the court <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#82:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#83:1:A>
Now Your Honour my next point is <{> <[> regarding </[> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#84:1:A>
My next point is regarding the seizure of article

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#85:1:B>
<[> <w> What's </w> that </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#86:1:B>
Seizure of article

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#87:1:A>
Article <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#88:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#89:1:A>
Now Your Honour in this case <,,> if we believe the
prosecution case <,,> where there was a burn injury <,> on the chest portion
<,,> from front

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#90:1:B>
Chest to abdomen

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#91:1:A>
Chest to abdomen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#92:1:A>
Then in that case the blouse which was produced <,,> by the <,,> uh
under <indig> panchanama </indig> seized in a <,> seized and produce under
<indig> panchanama </indig> Your Honour <,> that should be in burnt condition
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#93:1:A>
But here it is in torn condition Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#94:1:B>
Uh now this uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#95:1:A>
Now Your Honour <,,> in this case <,,> the only thing which I
would like to say <,,> that <,,> now Your Honour <,> as far as uh <,,> on
this point Your Honour only thing I would like to submit <,,> that uh <,> in
forwarding letter <,,> in forwarding letter <,,> the officer has stated <,,>
certain queries <,> in that queries Your Honour <,> the first question was
that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#96:1:A>
And <,> clear report to that effect <,,> is that <,,> on exhibit
one two and three are positive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#97:1:A>
But no where Your Honour in clear report it is mentioned as a <,>
blouse <.> wa </.> blouse <,,> was in burnt condition Your Honour <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#98:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#99:1:A>
Yes Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#100:1:B>
And <,> the <O> a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#101:1:A>
Yes Your Honour to have a kerosene on the <,,> article <,>
and <,,> and Your Honour <,> when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh
like a blouse <,,> or any cloth material Your Honour <,> then there is
likelihood that uh <,> it will burn Your Honour <,> even it will not be in
<,> this position

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#102:1:A>
Secondly Your Honour I am on the point as far as uh <.> cap </.>
<,> it <,> nowhere the witness or the <,,> in F I R neither in the <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#103:1:B>
At the scene of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#104:1:A>
Dying declaration Your Honour <,> it is stated that it is
sprinkled Your Honour <,> there is difference between sprinkling and pouring
Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#105:1:A>
Here it is poured Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#106:1:B>
But the <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#107:1:A>
Yes Your Honour but I am confining myself on the day of
incident Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#108:1:A>
As far as on the day of incident is concerned Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#109:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#110:1:A>
Different <}> <-> version is </-> <+> versions are </+> </}>
there in the F I R and in the <,> uh dying declaration Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#111:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#112:1:A>
As far as F I R is concerned Your Honour <,,> <}> <-> <.> sh
</.> </-> <=> she </=> </}> has stated that <,> today that means on eleven
nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband <@> Mahesh </@> assaulted me
<,,> as I didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me
<,,> at about four pm <,,> that thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#113:1:A>
There is a time gap of one hour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#114:1:A>
It means assaulting <,,> and between the quarrel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#115:1:A>
That means <,,> uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at
three p m <,,> and <,,> at about four pm I poured kerosene on my own person

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#116:1:B>
Ah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#117:1:A>
At about four pm <,,> I poured kerosene <,,> on my own person
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#118:1:B>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#119:1:A>
So within

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#120:1:B>
Article seizure of article <,> seizure of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#121:1:A>
Very well Your Honour I will first confine myself to seizure
of article Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#122:1:A>
As far as Your Honour seizure of article is concerned <,> I will
uh <,> humbly submit that as far as uh this uh <,,> blouse piece is concerned
<,> and if Your Honour will notice <,,> then <,,> I don't know whether uh
<,,> yes <,,> I think this is the first front portion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#123:1:A>
This is the front portion of the blouse Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#124:1:A>
And <,,> as per medical evidence Your Honour <,,> there was <-> a
</- > <,,> injury <,,> burn injury <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#125:1:A>
I will say <,> major burn injury <,> on chest and abdomen Your
Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#126:1:A>
In that case Your Honour this blouse would not <-> be </-> have
been intact Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#127:1:A>
This is intact because if your honour will see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#128:1:B>
Ah <?> this </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#129:1:A>
If Your Honour will see the uh <,,> <indig> patti </indig>
Your Honour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#130:1:B>
Ha

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#131:1:A>
Then it means this is a complete blouse <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#132:1:A>
The only thing <,,> somebody has cut <,> if Your Honour say that
it may have cut uh <,> by the C A <,,> uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#133:1:B>
It is taken by the C A

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#134:1:A>
Yes <w> that's </w> Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#135:1:A>
Your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition
of the <,,> <.> bl </.> this piece of cloth blouse <,> Your Honour it is a
full uh <,> it is a complete one <,,> only it is in torn condition <,> but
not in burnt condition

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#136:1:B>
It is not torn <,> here it is burnt <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#137:1:A>
Your Honour but uh then I will submit that looking into the
uh <,,> medical uh <,,> <}> <-> <.> me me </.> </-> <=> medical </=> </}>
evidence Your Honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#138:1:A>
I will say that uh this is not <}> <-> a </-> <+> the </+> </}>
same <,> blouse <,,> which could have been worn by the complainant on that
day your honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#139:1:A>
This is on that day <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#140:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#141:1:A>
And uh same is my argument as far as two <indig> sarees
</indig> are concerned Your Honour <,,> two <indig> sarees </indig> have been
produced <,> but

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#142:1:B>
<indig> Sarees </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#143:1:A>
No Your Honour <,> I am not on that point your honour <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#144:1:A>
I am on different point now <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#145:1:A>
As far as this is concerned I say it is not uh <,> burnt <,> but
it is only in torn condition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#146:1:A>
But as far as this <,> uh these two <indig> sarees </indig> are
concerned Your Honour <,> my submission is that <,,> that a person <,> cannot
wear two <indig> sarees </indig> at a <,> <-> at one </-> time <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-066#147:1:A>
And practically it is not possible <,,> to wear two <indig> sarees
</indig> <,,> uh on the time of alleged incident Your Honour <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#148:1:B>
Therefore

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#149:1:A>
So <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#150:1:B>
It was <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#151:1:A>
Blanket

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#152:1:B>
Blanket <O> a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#153:1:A>
Your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not
brought on the record <,,> that uh <,> why the two <indig> sarees </indig>
were used

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#154:1:B>
No no maybe

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-066#155:1:C>

found there <,> has been taken charge under the <indig> panchanama </indig>
