<ICE-IND:S1A-069#1:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#2:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#3:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#4:1:B>
I was working there in one project <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> for one
year <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#5:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#6:1:A>
With whom that uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#7:1:B>
Uh Dr Lal <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#8:1:A>
Much glad

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#9:1:B>
So do I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#10:1:A>
Lad <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#11:1:B>
Lal Lal <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#12:1:A>
Lal <,> Lal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#13:1:A>
Now <,> you joined here some three years ago <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#14:1:B>
Four <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#15:1:A>
Four years ago <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#16:1:B>
No three years ago <,> three three and half years <,,> you are
not going sir <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#17:1:A>
Uhn <,,> probably <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#18:1:B>
No no not like that <,> physical <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#19:1:A>
No physical <w> I'm </w> alright <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#20:1:B>
I thought you are

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#21:1:A>
I am yet <?> differed </?> because of the some problems knotty
problem <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#22:1:B>
As a head of any <,> institution <,> it has to be there <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#23:1:A>
Loudly <,,> <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#24:1:B>
As a head of any institution <,> the problem <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#25:1:A>
Yeah <,> you must face <,> yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#26:1:B>
Yeah <,> I think that is the <,> first requirement of <,> that
chair <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#27:1:B>
But anyway that way our department is quite <,,> cool and calm that
is what <,,> we think <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> students <,> I don't know <,> what
staff members feel <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#28:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#29:1:A>
That way <,> what you say is correct

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#30:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> yeah there is not much of a politics and
uh <,,> people are quite cool <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#31:1:B>
Even non- teaching staff is good <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#32:1:A>
Cooperative

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#33:1:B>
Faithful and cooperative <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#34:1:A>
But that will become element <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#35:1:C>
<w> That's </w> always

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#36:1:A>
Prospectus element <,> <{> <[> yes <,> beside <w> it's </w>
very <,> in their way in their own way <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#37:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#38:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#39:1:A>
And they erupt some time <,> they try to show there it will
solve <,> they want to show that <O> one word </O> <,,> in the department <,>
they make sometime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#40:1:A>
<w> You've </w> <,> worked on Synthelysis or <?> electrons </?> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#41:1:B>
Synthelysis not analysis

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#42:1:A>
Not analysis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#43:1:A>
What is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your
appendix <,> but say for a common man <,> like Dr Shastri

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X44:1:C>
Yeah for a common man <,> yeah </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#45:1:A>
So how do you <,> say intellectual and what is <,> a viva <,>
in a very general term

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#46:1:B>
Yeah in general term I can uh say <,> there is uh <,> a layer
called as Ionosphere <,> in the in <w> earth's </w> upper atmosphere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#47:1:B>
You may be knowing about it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#48:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#49:1:B>
If you are uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#50:1:A>
I may be

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#51:1:B>
If you are studying science

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#52:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#53:1:A>
No no I have different side

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X54:1:C>
I am in English <,> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#55:1:A>
No you can

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#56:1:B>
So this uh this Ionosphere is held by ionised electrons <,> in
sufficient numbers <,> so as to affect the radio waves latitude <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#57:1:B>
They effect on the radio valency <,> they have the effect on radio
valency <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#58:1:B>
Now this uh <,> Ionosphere <,> though it has all the ionised
species and all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#59:1:B>
Now <w> it's </w> very nuclei ionised plasma <,,> because the <,>
air density <,> at that height where this ionosphere is present

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X60:1:C>
But what I could understand is not some physics <w> that's </w>
something your your uh <,> personal things you know like you were in Bombay
or you were in Goa <,> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#61:1:B>
Goa that way we will

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X62:1:C>
That is much Indian understand <O> laughs </O> they are
appreciated now rather than </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#63:1:A>
But you see their is another side of her life

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X64:1:C>
Uh ha <,> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#65:1:A>
Which seems more more interesting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#66:1:A>
She is uh defending uh <,,> uhm rights of these uh <,,> one uh
rights of women <,>

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X67:1:C>
Oh rights of women </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#68:1:A>
Or legal <,> no no on the legal side

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X69:1:C>
<w> That's </w> very interesting </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#70:1:A>
On the legal side not on <.> so </.> social side <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#71:1:B>
No even on social side

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#72:1:A>
But uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#73:1:B>
When I was working <,> yeah I was working with one
organisation which had many activities of this type <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#74:1:B>
And I have got even uh <,> experience of working with <,> family
council <,> and uh legal examiners <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#75:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> <w> that's </w> what <w> it's </w> legal
examiner

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#76:1:B>
Legal examiner <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#77:1:A>
Then how many cases you have handled so far <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#78:1:B>
Uh <,,> as a social worker I have handled around <,> eighty to
hundred cases <,> hundred cases

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#79:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#80:1:B>
Because <,> that <,> legalised centre which we had <,> we <,>
we used to have a thrice a week <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#81:1:B>
And you won't believe sir <,> the day we had the office <,,> it was
<,> fully crowded <,> on those days since morning till evening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#82:1:B>
And we were so many of them <,> some fifteen twenty people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#83:1:B>
We used to sit in one one corner with <,> one one <,> lady and with
her family and <,> that boys side and <,> uh <w> husband's </w> side and <,>
her side her father mother and everyone <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#84:1:B>
And that <indig> chou chou chou </indig> <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#85:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#86:1:B>
<w> It's </w> really I mean when you go into that <indig> na
</indig> <,> we realised that there are so many <,> not only <w> I'm </w> not
talking about women <,> but there are so many things in our society which
<,,> have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#87:1:B>
And so many supress things within the family <,,> they affect
individual ways very much <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#88:1:A>
So <,> for example you can think of something which is
dreadful event <,> one case <,> which you would call very much far

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#89:1:B>
Uh uh there was uh there was one <,> very peculiar case <,> uh
in the sense that it was from the <,,> very low income group <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#90:1:B>
They they used to stay in Bombay you know <,> slum kind of area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#91:1:B>
Not fully slum but you can call it uh semi- <,> slum kind of thing
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#92:1:B>
And that man he was the only son of that man <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#93:1:B>
And uh he had some three or four sisters <,> all of them they were
unmarried <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#94:1:B>
Unmarried in the sense they were uh <,,> of course they were <,>
younger to him <,> that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he
was married <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#95:1:B>
Uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh <,> because
of the torture from these <,> <{> <-> sister-in-laws </-> <+> sisters-in-law
</+> </{> and from <,> mother-in-law and from father-in-law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#96:1:B>
She left him <,> and in <,> that category I mean like low income
group <,> they don't go for all these uh <,> legal processes <,> through
court and all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#97:1:B>
The <,> breaking that is the divorce is a very simple thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#98:1:B>
They just leave the person and then they go <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#99:1:B>
Then he got married to a girl from his own <,> relations <,> that
is uh <,,> his <indig> <w> mama's </w> </indig> daughter <,> cousin sister
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#100:1:B>
And even then <,> she was having a similar kind of torture <,>
torture means I cannot explain you to what extent that torture was

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#101:1:B>
That girl <,> she had to <,> go in that uh common <,> lavotory

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#102:1:B>
In Bombay <,> in the slum areas there are these common toilets and
common bathroom <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#103:1:B>
So she had to go there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#104:1:B>
She used to come back window she used to call someone <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#105:1:B>
She used to tell them that please give me some <indig> chapati
</indig> or some bread to eat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#106:1:B>
I mean it was that <,> kind of thing they were not giving her food
<,> no water no food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#107:1:B>
And they used to <,> and <,> when we had some people setting it
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#108:1:B>
We really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#109:1:B>
Actually that her husband was a good man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#110:1:B>
The only thing is he used to drink

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#111:1:B>
He was a worker in some factory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#112:1:B>
He used to drink a little bit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#113:1:B>
He never used to <,> hit her like <,> nothing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#114:1:B>
But all this people they used to harass her <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#115:1:B>
Then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is <,>
he is the only earning source of the family <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#116:1:B>
And all of them they had this fear <,> that if this person <,> if
he has a very good relationship with his wife <,> and if there is a sound
relationship <,> <.> fam </.> sound family life <,> there is a possibility of
him going and staying separate <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#117:1:A>
Oh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#118:1:B>
So that was the sole reason for this torture to the <,>
daughter-in-law <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#119:1:A>
You know that's a fact <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#120:1:B>
And then we had to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#121:1:A>
Complex issues <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#122:1:B>
And then we had to <,> uhm inform her father <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#123:1:B>
Her father was in some village <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#124:1:B>
She didn't know the address properly

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#125:1:B>
She was illiterate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#126:1:B>
And then he was working with one sugar factory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#127:1:B>
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we <,> contacted
some official to tell her husband <,> that if this if this person working
with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#128:1:B>
So <,> then he came <,> to Bombay we talked to him

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#129:1:B>
But these people they didn't even allow her to meet him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#130:1:B>
And there were so many problems and finally <,> we rescued that
girl because <,> she didn't want <,> she had the total <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#131:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#132:1:B>
So she was sent back to her parents <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#133:1:B>
But one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take
her like <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#134:1:A>
I see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#135:1:B>
And yeah in certain cases they they refused <,> they say that
we don't <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#136:1:B>
If she she is married <,,> she is to come out of the house <,> and
she has to die and she has to come out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#137:1:B>
That is she is not allowed to come out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#138:1:B>
Atleast in this case they were ready to take her <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#139:1:A>
Fine <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#140:1:C>
What we did anything

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#141:1:A>
And that man didn't comment anything <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#142:1:B>
He didn't say anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#143:1:B>
He had no voice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#144:1:B>
Though he was the earning soul <,> he was <,> treated or or he was
atleast he was brought up <,> he started earning very early <,> at early age
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#145:1:B>
So I think he was brought up in that manner that uh <,> you know
<,> in this entire world his parents and his sisters <,,> <{> <-> is </-> <+>
are </+> </{> <,> everything for him nothing more <,,> other relationships
are not important <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#146:1:B>
You work so many and uh it was really a <,> I mean <,> <w> it's
</w> very difficult to work continously at this branch <,> you yourself uh
<,,> and then you have so many problems of your own <,> listening to all
things no <,> then you disturb <,> you get disturb like emotionally <,>
mentally <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#147:1:A>
There is one case in our department <,> right now

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#148:1:B>
Is it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#149:1:A>
That that uh <,> different case is <,> <w> it's </w> not a
bit <,> uhm yet selfish to say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#150:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#151:1:A>
But the problem is <,> that <w> girl's </w> father came <,,>
and got her admission under the V J N T quota <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#152:1:B>
Which quota

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#153:1:A>
V J <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#154:1:B>
Uhn <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#155:1:A>
<indig> Vimukhta Jati </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#156:1:B>
<indig> Haan haan </indig> yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#157:1:A>
Some nomadic tribe

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#158:1:B>
Some nomadic tribe <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#159:1:A>
And she went through the waiting list and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#160:1:A>
But according to medical level we have to categorise she got <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#161:1:A>
Now she completed part one <,> then part two <,> and she gave <,>
her specialisation <,> theoritical specialisation

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#162:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#163:1:A>
She is the only one in the batch

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#164:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#165:1:A>
This girl sat for this

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#166:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#167:1:A>
So I was surprised that uh <,> record uh <,> showing class
student <,> it gave uh subject of such a high <O> a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#168:1:A>
Then <,,> uhm <,,> after that she joined <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#169:1:A>
The classes started <,> her father came <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#170:1:A>
Then he talked to me <,> one and half hours in Marathi <,> like
that <,>

<$C> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#X171:1:C>
Uhm </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#172:1:A>
So <,> that <w> lady's </w> father came and told me <,> that
uh <,> he he is responsible for her <,> education and uh you know there must
be coersive data <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#173:1:A>
And uhm <,> uh and she must marry to <,> a person uhn <,> who is
some relative <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#174:1:A>
But who is a <,> uh rock breaker <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#175:1:B>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#176:1:A>
Not educated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#177:1:A>
But uh the family relationship required the man <,> uhn the father
<,> to fix that <,> she had to marry that fellow <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#178:1:A>
Now <,,> then uh <,> but personally <,,> I don't know how to solve
this problem <,,> and she stopped attending the classes now <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#179:1:B>
Now she will get marry <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#180:1:A>
No we don't know <,> because she refuse <,> she refused to
stay in the hostel <,> though her father is paying the money <,> she got the
admission in the hostel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#181:1:A>
She is staying with somebody in the city <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#182:1:B>
She is uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#183:1:A>
And uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#184:1:B>
I I don't think that she will agree for this <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#185:1:A>
She will not agree but she will not study

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#186:1:A>
My problem is how do you solve her educational problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#187:1:A>
<{> <[> <w> I'm </w> not </[> worried about her

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#188:1:B>
<[> That is uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#189:1:B>
As I said it will take uh <,> sometime in the sense when she
will uh <,> get settled mentally

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#190:1:A>
No <,> <w> that's </w> not the point <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#191:1:A>
When you take a subject like theoritical physics <,> the proper
environment <,> in the first week itself <w> you've </w> to study book <,> if
it is not so <,> this is not something like you can wait to <w> it's </w> not
history or geography <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#192:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#193:1:A>
When the same classmate <,> same group of students are
studying <,> one has to study

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#194:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#195:1:A>
If they miss that bus <,> <w> it's </w> very difficult for
them to cope up and adjust <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#196:1:A>
You may say that <w> I'll </w> settle the life <,> after uh <,>
some day

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#197:1:B>
Has she has she talked to you or uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#198:1:A>
No she is not opening her mouth at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#199:1:A>
She is so obstinate <,> she comes to the classroom <,> she is dead
silent <,> no sign on the face <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#200:1:A>
Not even acknowledging <,> presence of others <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#201:1:A>
She is she is slight <,> so stern and strong willed <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#202:1:B>
So she was not like this in <O> one word </O> <,> or uh have
you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#203:1:A>
Definitely <,> much more <,> than she was last year

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#204:1:B>
Uhm <,> last year she was quite social

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#205:1:A>
Some <,> not quite

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#206:1:B>
But little bit <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#207:1:A>
Little bit

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#208:1:B>
She has cut off <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#209:1:A>
Now she is not attending classes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#210:1:A>
And if she doesn't attend <w> I've </w> to cancel her uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#211:1:B>
Admission <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#212:1:A>
But ususally <,,> what they say <,> I have to do <,> in the
vacation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#213:1:A>
Then the government of India has given thirty percent reservation
in this category <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#214:1:B>
Yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government
services <,> isn't it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#215:1:B>
Like how it is for other uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#216:1:A>
No it may be implemented <indig> na </indig> <,> say for
admissions <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#217:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#218:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#219:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#220:1:A>
Uhm <,> why not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#221:1:A>
Not present why <,> thirty percent in the nomination <w> they're
</w> <,> put so <,> and actually <,> for every type of uh activity <,> for
group <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#222:1:A>
That is educational <,> political <,> administrative <,> any kind
of uh <,> national activity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#223:1:A>
And Muncipality they are having certificates

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#224:1:B>
Yeah they have held <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#225:1:A>
People are contesting now elections

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#226:1:B>
In Kolhapur was the first <{> <[> city </[> to

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#227:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#231:1:A>
<[> Thirty percent reservation </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#232:1:B>
Certain seats were reserved <,> so certain constituency they
were reserved for women <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-069#233:1:B>
So Kolhapur is the first <,> city in Maharashtra <,> after this
rule came <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-069#234:1:A>
Uhm

<$B>
