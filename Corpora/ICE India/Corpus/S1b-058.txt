<I> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#X1:1> ( a) Whether it is a fact that twenty-four odd doctors <,> who had
been on plague control duty at the Indira Gandhi international airport since
October first nineteen ninety-four <,> were on duty till twenty-ninth
November nineteen ninety-four <,> more than a month after the <mention>
World Health Organization </mention> declared <,> that plague was no more a
threat in the country <,> and ( b) <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#X2:1> If so <,> the details and reason for retaining the team at the
airport for such a long period <,> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#3:1:B>
Sir question number two zero two <,> ( a) and ( b) <,,> I have
check at the airport <+> they </+> were continue even after plague was fully
contained <,> to alliviate the apprehension of the other countries as per as
the recommendation of <,> <mention> World Health Organisation </mention> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#4:1:A>
Uh next <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#5:1:C>
It is good thing that the government has extended the stay of
doctors <,,> at the international airport on the <,> advice of the <,,>
<mention> World Health Organization </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#6:1:C>
But the main point is why this <,> dreadful disease or epidemic <,,>
has suddenly appeared in our country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#7:1:C>
Whether the government <,,> have necessary impact of the <,> origin
and impact of the plague <,> why it came suddenly <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#8:1:C>
And what steps <,> government has taken <,> in order to assess the
<,> epidemic <,,> and uh <,,> the loss of life <,> and property <,> and also
<,,> what steps have been taken on the <,,> uh recommendations for uh <,>
memorandum submitted by the municipal union of <,,> uh Surat <,,> which said
<,> in the wake of floods in Tapti river <,,> and the wake of large amount of
garbage piling up there <,> they <,> advised the municipal authorities and
the government <,> to appoint number of uh <,> extra staff to clear the
garbage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#9:1:C>
But the government did not take

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#10:1:C>
What steps <,> the government had taken to review the <,> causes
for this disease and its eradication <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#11:1:C>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#12:1:A>
Honourable minister <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#13:1:B>
Sir <,,> as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance
in the Beed district of Maharashtra <,> and subsequently in Surat sir <,> the
government of India has taken all possible help sending <,> expert and
medicine and all support to the <,> uh respective state government to control
plague sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#14:1:B>
Sir about the <,,> occurrence of plague in our country sir we have
<,> appointed a committee under a renowned <.> sci </.> <,> medical scientist
Dr Ramaswamy Lingam

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#15:1:B>
Sir uh <,> <.> Ra </.> <,> <&> interruption </&> Ramalingam Swamy
and they they are requested to <-> give <,> their </-> have a detailed study
and give report <,> report within six months sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#16:1:B>
About about the <,> uh memorandum submitted by Surat I I don't have
any information about that sir <,> at at present <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#17:1:A>
Second supplementary please <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#18:1:C>
The main cause <,> for the occurrence of plague <,> and we
recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#19:1:C>
So the health of the country is going down <,,> like this <,> and
the government has not taken any steps

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#20:1:C>
But the main point I would like <+> to </+> ask the minister is
<,,> this piling up of garbage in municipality <,> though it was cleared up
in the <,> first days after the occurrence of plague <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#21:1:C>
But subsequently it was stopped <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#22:1:C>
It is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities <,>
and government has taken up evolved a plan <,> to provide finances <,,> to
clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#23:1:C>
Any plan of action is being contemplated by the government <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#24:1:B>
Sir <,,> the garbage problem all over the country specially
the municipal corporation are all over the country sir <,> and this municipal
corporation administration come under the State governemnt sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#25:1:B>
We are in contact with the state government to take appropriate
action <,> to clean up <,> clean up their <-> keep clean </-> their city sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#26:1:B>
And and that part we have <,> informed the State government

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#27:1:B>
Sir not only the plague there are <}> <-> <.> ot </.> </-> <=>
other </=> </}> it is a very unhealthy scene to have <O> one word </O> in any
city or in any municipal <,> uh uh area sir and and it is <,> directly under
the State government

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#28:1:B>
But we have <,> uh uh <,> told the State government to take
appropriate action so that there should not be any <O> one word </O> but <,,>
it is upto the State government sir <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#29:1:A>
Mr Das <X> Shri Guru Das Gupta </X> <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#30:1:D>
Sir <,,> the cause for plague is piling up garbage <,,> one of
the causes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#31:1:D>
And there is piling of garbage everywhere <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#32:1:D>
Now the honourable minister says <,,> that it has advised the
municipal corporations <,,> to clean the garbage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#33:1:D>
But the point is <}> <-> <.> import </.> </-> <=> important </=>
</}> point is <,,> they are all <,,> all the diseases are reappearing <,>
plague <,> malaria <,> cholera <,> they all reappeared <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#34:1:D>
But right to health is a normal human right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#35:1:D>
Without passing on the path <,,> I could I <,> let me ask <-> me
</-> the honourable minister whether the government <,> Health ministry of
Union government shall make available <,> additional funds <,> for the use
<,,> of the municipalities <,> to take emergency measures <,> for cleaning of
the garbage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#36:1:D>
Of course political garbage cannot be cleaned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#37:1:D>
That is different <,> but the other garbage is to be cleaned <,>
and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position
to make allocation for additional funds <,> so that <,> plague and malaria
can be eradicated

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#38:1:D>
Nowhere in the world it is coming up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#39:1:D>
But in India <,> again we are getting

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#40:1:D>
What about the funds ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#41:1:D>
Will you make available <,> funds <,> to the municipality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#42:1:D>
Will you make available <,,> will you make available additional
funds <,> for this particular purpose <,> to the municipalities and the State
governments <,> without just issuing a circular <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#43:1:B>
Uh Mr Chairman sir <,,> I can appreciate the honourable <w>
member's </w> concern for health <,,> to the people of this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#44:1:B>
As <,> the house is aware that the health is a state subject <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#45:1:B>
The states have to provide necessary funds <,,> for the maintenance
of the public health facilities <,,> in eradication of <,> the diseases which
affect the common man <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#46:1:B>
Now the question question <O> two words </O> put the question about
providing funds to the municipalities <,> on emergent basis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#47:1:B>
To help them <,> to remove this garbage <,> which is lying there
<,,> almost in all the municipalities of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#48:1:B>
Sir as I said earlier <,> we have been in constant touch with the
State governments <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#49:1:B>
We have requested the state Chief Secretary then the health
Ministers <,> to take necessary steps in this regard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#50:1:B>
Basically <,,> the municipalities <,> or the local <,,> health
authorities local self governments <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#51:1:B>
They are the local authorities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#52:1:B>
They have their own <,> powers they have their own <,> funds <,>
and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#53:1:B>
But by saying that <,> we will not avoid our responsibility <,> to
come into the aid of the <,> maintenance of the health of people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#54:1:B>
The honourable member had said that <,,> its nowhere in the world
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#55:1:B>
But information in the house I can quote <,,> where plague is
taking the toll of the people in <-> the </-> other country <&> interruption
</&> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#56:1:B>
I don't think I don't think I will be able to pacify the honourable
member but I <}> <-> am </-> <+> have </+> </}> given the information for the
<,> benefit of the house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#57:1:B>
Sir uh <,,> in other countries <,,> in Africa <,,> Madagascar <,>
Uganda <,> Zaire <,,> in South Africa Peru <,> in United States of America
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#58:1:B>
In the United States of America <,,> I don't <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#59:1:B>
In United States of America <&> interruption </&> in Asia Turkistan
Mongolia Myanmar <,> and some other countries in the world have deliberately
not shown that it has though there is plague <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#60:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> not that only in India plague is there <&>
interruption </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#61:1:A>
Please <,> minister is answering completing his answer <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#62:1:B>
Sir <,,> there would not be any <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#63:1:A>
Please <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#64:1:B>
There would not be any more permanent conclusion <,> then the
honourable member is <O> a few words </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#65:1:D>
Sir <,> <&> interruption </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#66:1:A>
Please please <,> please tell the answer the point <,> so that
I can go to another question

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#67:1:B>
Sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#68:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#69:1:B>
I would like to inform the member not to the house <,> in <O>
a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#70:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#71:1:B>
That I won successively seven times parliament <mention> Lok
Sabha </mention> elections <,> <&> noise </&> on public <O> one word </O> <,>
let him not teach me the lessons of integrity

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#72:1:E>
<O> A few words </O> <,,> and it has caused much <,> to all
our concerns in a country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#73:1:E>
But what a havoc more is sir <,,> the publicity <,> alone in
publicity <,> in <O> one word </O> improfessional magnitude <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#74:1:E>
So that <,> it caused havoc in the economy of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#75:1:E>
Most of the foreigners <,> refused to come to this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#76:1:E>
Because of that <,> our tourism income has also come down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#77:1:E>
Yes <,> in so many ways the <.> ma </.> the process has caused <,>
much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#78:1:E>
Under these conditions we should make the foreigners know <,> that
the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published <,> for that
what has the government to do to contained the press to go <,> publishing
like uh this alarming magnitude

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#79:1:E>
And also in future also such thing should not happen

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#80:1:E>
For that what <,> <&> interruption </&> you see the question is
what <,,> steps the government has taken to contain the press <,> and also in
future to guard <,> <&> interruption </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#81:1:A>
Yeah thank you

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#82:1:E>
Thank you sir <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#83:1:B>
Unfortunately the media overplayed <,,> the plague situation
in the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#84:1:B>
Even when the world health authorities <,> came here to certify
that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the
government <,> to control and contained this disease <,> the media didn't
support unfortunately <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#85:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not <,> that we have not done the job

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#86:1:B>
We have done the job <O> one word </O> world over we are being
praised <,> for effective control of this plague <,> in very quick way

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#87:1:A>
Mr Swaminathan <,,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#88:1:F>
Recently I had occasion to meet the <O> two words </O> the
world renowned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#89:1:F>
They had a conference in <-> the </-> India <,> at about during the
time of plague <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#90:1:F>
And in that conference they have concluded <,> it was not plague at
all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#91:1:F>
The disease was not plague at all

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#92:1:F>
It was a disease just stimulating plague <,> and originally because
these people have found out and report to the press it was plague <,> they
have been consistently saying it is the plague

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#93:1:F>
He had also also given me a paper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#94:1:F>
For want of time I couldn't go through it completely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#95:1:F>
Well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the
disease is not a plague <,> but a disease which has stimulated plague <,> and
because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have
been consistently saying that is plague <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#96:1:B>
Sir <,> uh it is confirmed by the <,> N I C the national <,>
uh our communicative diseases sir uh <O> one word </O> they said it is plague
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#97:1:B>
And it is clarified by the <,> or supported by our scientist <,>
medical scientist also have supported

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#98:1:A>
I K Gujral <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#99:1:G>
The <,,> honourable minister is right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#100:1:A>
Just a second just a second I am <O> two words </O> just
after this

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#101:1:G>
In addition to what my colleague said sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#102:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#103:1:G>
The honourable member wants to know <,> about the terms of
reference of this committee I think <O> a few words </O> <&> interruption
</&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#104:1:A>
Yes yes yes <,>

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#105:1:H>
<O> A few words </O> financial matters will he look

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#106:1:G>
Because not <,> because primarily that is the agency to do
something that is why I want that there is nothing <,> like that in the sense
of the <&> interruption </&> you can help sir uh <,> I can repeat <O> two
words </O> the house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#107:1:G>
That the terms of reference records <,,> is to elucidate factors
responsible for the current outbreak of plague <,> plague and infact perhaps
it includes what it say <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#108:1:G>
I say <,> will they will the committee

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#109:1:H>
Whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that
also the committee can look into it

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#110:1:G>
Alright then your <,> you make it so clear <,> and you write
to the committee that you can go into it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#111:1:G>
I will be happy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#112:1:A>
Shree <.> Guj </.> I K Gujral

<$I> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-058#113:1:I>
Sir uh <,,> the honourable minister <,,> has tried to <,>
underplay <,,> the situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#114:1:I>
<w> It's </w> not a question of propaganda

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#115:1:I>
<w> It's </w> not a question <,> whether it is so many cases more
or less

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#116:1:I>
Issue basically is <,,> and I hope my honourable friend knows that
not once not twice not three times <,> in last <,,> forty or fifty years <,>
there are any number of reports available <,> and you do not need one more
expert to make it <,> to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the
country <,> except the <mention> N D M C </mention> <,> which is financially
viable okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#117:1:I>
Now the point is sir <,> if <}> <-> our </-> <=> you </=> </}> are
going by the plan <,,> and if the planning is to be made <,> obviously
government I assume I hope <,> is a is a corporate body works together <,>
</I> And therefore may I ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the
planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to
be increased No.(1)

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#118:1:I>
No.(2) Sir, has the honourable <O> one word </O> thought in terms
of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't
need a WHO report to tell us that our seat is updating

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#119:1:I>
It doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#120:1:I>
They will first collect garbage on the road side and then we
remove it

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#121:1:I>
And therefore all along disease is <O> one word </O> This incident
of plague whatever dimension I am not discussing has brought up and despare
at home

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#122:1:I>
May I ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the
committee <O> one word </O> to avoid the situation

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#123:1:I>
Has the cabinet I wrote to Cabinet myself the prime <O> one word
</O> wrote back to me that the <O> one word </O> and the ministry of urban
Development

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#124:1:I>
Have the ministry of Urban Development and ministry of health set
together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and
sanitation improves? Swaminathan Sir the honourable member is right <O> one
word </O> what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the
limits of municipality

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#125:1:I>
It doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to
solve this problem not only the health ministry

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#126:1:I>
This is by the ministry of Urban Development, local ministry, the
state ministry and the local authorities concerned

<ICE-IND:S1B-058#127:1:I>
As far as the <O> one word </O> necessarily we have to find a way
and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for
that <O> one word </O> suggestion <O> one word </O> </I>
