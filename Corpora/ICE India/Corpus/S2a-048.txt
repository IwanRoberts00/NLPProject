Mr Vice Chancellor <,,> Mr Narayana Rao <,,> distinguished
members of the faculty <,,> ladies and gentlemen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#2:1:A>
You know the great advantage of being Chief Election Commissioner of
India <,,> is that in the last few days and a last few months I have been
able to achieve <,,> life long ambitions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#3:1:A>
Only last week I achieved the life long ambition of entering into
the Stella <w> Mary's </w> college in Madras <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#4:1:A>
And today <,> I have achieved the ambition of getting into the
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#5:1:A>
A <,,> kind of <,,> place of education academics and learning <,,>
which would normally frown upon any bureaucrats <,,> much more a bureaucrat
whose name is synonymous with controversy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#6:1:A>
The Vice Chancellor has been good enough <,,> or bad enough not to
give me a subject <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#7:1:A>
In the trade <,> which I follow once I get hold of the mike you
don't let go off it easily <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#8:1:A>
So if I don't let go off the mike <,> Kamal Narayan will show me
some little <,,> symbols to show that it is getting late and that his blood
pressure is rising <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#9:1:A>
Mr Narayana Rao gave you <,,> an introduction about myself

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#10:1:A>
He said many nice things he said so many nice things that I thought
he was describing somebody else <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#11:1:A>
He didn't tell you that I wrote the S S L C exam what used to be
the end of school exam twice <,,> <O> laughter and applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#12:1:A>
He did not tell you that I wrote what in those days days the plus
two exam used to be called the Intermediate <,> I wrote that twice <,,> <O>
laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#13:1:A>
And when K Subramaniam taught me English at the Madras Christian
College <,> in March Nineteen fifty-one I wrote the English preliminary exam
for the Physics honors twice <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#14:1:A>
So how can you invite a person of this kind of academic
qualification to the most outstandingly academic circmustances <,> of the
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#15:1:A>
No no no I forgot to tell you <,> I wrote those exams twice each
year <,,> because the question papers had leaked <,,> <O> laughter and
applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#16:1:A>
Nineteen <,,> nineteen forty-seven was the first time the S S L C
queation papers leaked in Madras <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#17:1:A>
Nineteen forty-nine was the first year <,> in which the
Intermediate question papers leaked in Madras

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#18:1:A>
Nineteen fifty <,> was the first time when a honors degree
preliminary examination question paper <,> be it English or something else
<,> leaked in Madras <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#19:1:A>
So I wrote most of them twice

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#20:1:A>
I am not going to tell you my academic abilities because <,,> they
are part of the history of an extinguished Civil Servant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#21:1:A>
I have been in bonded labour with government for thirty-six years
from April nineteen fifty-five till December of Nineteen ninety <,,> when <,>
in a moment of <,> extraordinary carelessness <,> the then Prime Minister put
me into this job <,> despite the warning <,,> <O> laughter </O> of a previous
Prime Minister who said this gentleman will still live to rule the day they
make you Chief Election Commissioner <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-048#22:1:B>
He did <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-048#23:1:A>
He did <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#24:1:A>
Roughly two and half years later speaking on the floor of
Parliament in February ninety-two Mr Chandrasekhar the former Prime Minister
said <,,> <quote> <w> I've </w> done many <,,> serious mistakes in my life
none has been so serious <,> as the appointment of Mr Seshan as the Chief
Election Commissioner </quote> <,,> <O> laughter and applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#25:1:A>
I have a feeling <,> that Mr <w> Chandrasekhar's </w> feeling
towards me are slightly less frozen now <,> because <,> more recently I have
noticed the sign of thaw <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#26:1:A>
You <,,> basically are a set of teachers <,,> teachers and <w>
teacher's </w> teachers and <w> teacher's </w> <w> teacher's </w> teachers
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#27:1:A>
And who am I to speak to you about <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#28:1:A>
What am I to speak to you about <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#29:1:A>
The Vice Chancellor to some degree <,> and Mr Narayan Rao to a
greater degree spoke of India and its democracy <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#30:1:A>
When you talk of <w> India's </w> democracy <,,> you can hold your
head up in <,> great pride and say <quote> Where else <,,> in the world do
you get the democracy of this kind </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#31:1:A>
On the first of July last about two three months ago <w> India's
</w> population was nine hundred and nineteen million people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#32:1:A>
Of that about a five hundred and fifty million were voters above
the age of eighteen

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#33:1:A>
Anybody who is above the age of eighteen who is an Indian citizen
<,> who is not a confirmed lunatic and who has not been declared disqualified
by some law <,> is entitled to be a voter <,,> and he is entitled to be a
voter in a particular place if he is ordinarily resident in that place

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#34:1:A>
That is what the law says <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#35:1:A>
The law was not passed by me it was passed in nineteen <,,> fifty
<,> when I was still studying Physics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#36:1:A>
When we run a full national election in this country we run the
election in eight hundred thousand polling booths <,,> man by four million
civilian employees at the rate of five <,,> per polling booth

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#37:1:A>
<w> We're </w> going to shortly make it six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#38:1:A>
Why are you suddenly increasing it five to six <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#39:1:A>
Because we are going to have compulsorily atleast one <,> woman
polling officer in each booth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#40:1:A>
So that Mr Lalu Yadav <,,> who told the T V last week only <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#41:1:A>
He said <&> in Hindi </&> <O> laughter </O> who will be a lady <,,>
<O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#42:1:A>
And Mr Lalu Yadav will not be unhappy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#43:1:A>
So I was saying <quote> We use four million employees in addition
to that <,> we use a million and half policemen outside <,> all kinds of
policemen state policemen state armed policemen state reserved policemen <,,>
uh state home guards policemen <,> state every kind of policemen <,> central
policemen central reserve police border security force Indo-Tibetan border
police <,> central Industrial security force Railway protection force <,> <O>
laughter </O> any number of forces <,,> we use one and half million policemen
to run a full election in this country </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#44:1:A>
When parliament run its election in nineteen ninety-one a few
months after I became the Chief Election Commissioner <,,> we had nine
thousand candidates for five hundred and odd parliamentary seats <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#45:1:A>
But what an average of about eighteen candidates per seat there
were some seats in which <,> there were even a hundred candidates were <,>
per constituency <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#46:1:A>
In one part of India not necessarily for a parliament seat for an
assembly seat <,> in Tamil Nadu at a place called Araba Puruchi we had three
hundred and seventy candidates <,> for the assembly seat

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#47:1:A>
So that the ballet did not look <,> like a sheet out of <w> India's
</w> <,> todays newspaper <,> it looked like todays edition of the newspaper
<,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#48:1:A>
When parliament election runs in a normal course if there are nine
thousand candidates we consume twenty thousand tons of high quality paper
<,,> and to each and every polling booth we reach seventy-five items <,> like
Alice in Wonderland <,> of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and
things of why the sea is boiling lots of ballet boxes <,> and ballet papers
and sealing wax and the <,> melting wax and wires and threads and uh <,,> all
kinds of things hurricane lantern <,> if the Andhra Pradesh electricity board
to switch off electricity don't worry I can reach you without benefit of mike
<,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#49:1:A>
Seventy-five items are reached to everyone of this places not all
of them are easily accessible <,> to motorise transport there are places
where only the camel can reach as in Jaisalmer <,> or in Bahmer or in Sawai
Madhavpur <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#50:1:A>
There are places like not only in Ladakh <,,> or Kargil <,> but
also in Lahore and <?> Spity </?> where only the largest helicopter of the
Indian force <,> the mig twenty-five can reach those polling booths <,> with
the polling party and the polling material

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#51:1:A>
There are parts of the <w> Sunderban's </w> jungle were only
elephant back will reach

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#52:1:A>
There are parts of the island territories <,> which only a boat
would reach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#53:1:A>
And thanks to the extraordinary <,,> good arrangements made by
distinguished predecessors of mine <w> I've </w> had eight predecessors <w>
I'm </w> the nineth Chief Election Commissioner of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#54:1:A>
Those arrangements are so good <,> that they are <,> the eighth
wonder of the world <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#55:1:A>
Make no laughing statement about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#56:1:A>
Hold your head high <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#57:1:A>
Adult franchise was introduced at the point of time at which <w>
India's </w> literacy was less than twenty percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#58:1:A>
Today <,> gentlemen in-charge of education programmes in different
parts of the country put out lie after lie after lie <,> all of governments
programmes are called crash programmes because they all crash <,,> <O>
laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#59:1:A>
Crash programme in English education do you conduct those <,,> ?
<O> laughter and applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#60:1:A>

Every crash every programme is called <.> ra </.> crash programme
in malaria eradication crash programme in <w> women's </w> environment <,>
everything is called a crash programme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#62:1:A>
But today at the end of all kinds of crash programmes literacy
amongst women in Bihar is still about four to five percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#63:1:A>
The Chief Minister will be angry to hear me say so

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#64:1:A>
He says <quote> It is ten percent </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#65:1:A>
Doesn't matter <w> I'll </w> concede ten percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#66:1:A>
In Haryana they say <quote> It has reached thirty percent </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#67:1:A>
But brides are largely <,> for burning <,> still in Haryana <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#68:1:A>
In Haryana brides are largely still for burning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#69:1:A>
If they don't produce a son they are burnt if they don't produce
dowry they are burnt <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#70:1:A>
Generally if they don't like the <.> dau </.> daughters-in-law they
are burnt <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#71:1:A>
First burn the daughter-in-law then ask the question <,,> <O>
laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#72:1:A>
In <?> their jest </?> <,> our fore-fathers <,> the founding
fathers of our constitution decided to endow upon the people of this country
adult franchise that anybody who was twenty-one at that time now converted to
eighteen in the last four or five years <,> has the right to elect the
government of this people <,> of this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#73:1:A>
When you talk of India <,> <w> you're </w> talking of Indian
democracy you talk of India <,> what is the picture of India that you get
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#74:1:A>

most of you are English teachers you don't know this but go and sit in
English class and the History classes <,,> whether in college or in school
are there any History teachers here <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#75:1:A>

They teach you <,,> about the greatness of my literature in Telugu
and my literature in Tamil and my literature in Kannada <,> and my literature
in Marathi and my literature in Gujrathi and my literature in something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#78:1:A>
<w> There's </w> hardly anybody to teach <,,> any of my children
<,,> my literature <,,> in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#79:1:A>
But that is not all <,,> the history you got to teach people in
this country <,> in bad English

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#80:1:A>
If you go to the history classes <,> Mr Ashoka dugged wells and he
builded hospitals <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#81:1:A>
That is the kind of history being taught <,,> you know what is the
use of giving only the English teachers to this class what about the History
teacher who gets into the class and dictates notes saying <quote> Ashoka
dugged wells <,> and he builded hospitals <,,> </quote>

little pot of water <,> and say <&> in Sanskrit </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#83:1:A>
That was long before somebody said Kaveri is my <w> grandfather's
</w> river <,> or my <w> grandmother's </w> river <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#84:1:A>

Have you taught the children of this country the greatness of this
country where there is a part of the country <,> which get five hundred and
fifty inches of rain per year and still has drinking water problem for five
months in the year <,> because they have rendered the total topography <,>
similar to my head <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#86:1:A>

Not of perfection but of completion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#91:1:A>
What do you teach them <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#92:1:A>
You teach them <,> that the Kakatiyas were in Warangal <,,> and the
Chalukyas were in Badami <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#93:1:A>
Fact what lot of good it does to me <,> to know that Kakatiya were
in Warangal and therefore Warangal University is named after Kakatiya <,> is
that right <,,> ? <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-048#94:1:A>
