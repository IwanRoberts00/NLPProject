<bold> The </bold> green world we live in has experimented, evolved
strattegies and struggled to build the present.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#4:1>
The biosphere we see today is a product of interaction of physical and
chemical processes during the geologic past.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#5:1>
The inter-related and inter-dependent system comprising various
components of lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere directly or
indirectly influenced the <quote> " Phytosphere" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#6:1>
An insight into these various forces explains the saga of origin and
evolution of the past plant life, its strategies and factors responsible
for present day green scenario on our planet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#7:1>
The earth is like a living entity with its own consciousness and
may be compared to a spaceship.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#8:1>
Every one has a stake in its safety.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#9:1>
It demands a rational and sustained utilization and management of
space and resources.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#10:1>
It may also be considered a global village and compared with a small
village community where each individual has a role to play. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#11:1>
Behind the fragrance of champaka and the frail beauty of jasmine
lies the tenacious life force - - the desire to survive and to continue.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#12:1>
The alchemy to convert sunlight with inorganic elements and to
prepare basic food is the key to the greening of the earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#13:1>
Since the momentous day, billions of years ago, when the first speck
of life - - plant protoplasm - - puffed its first breath of oxygen into the
primeval sea the collective energy of the plant has been the force behind
their colonizing and conquering the earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#14:1>
This speck of life has kept the torch of life burning and is the
driving force behind evolution of organisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#15:1>
Ever since the first cell appeared on the earth the diversity of
life has continuously increased both in quality as well as quantity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#16:1>
These qualitative changes, in fact are the development of appropriate
strategies to face new challenges posed by change of physical conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#17:1>
It is not individuals, but populations of organisms that change.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#18:1>
They adapt to changing conditions or they leave fewer and fewer
replicas eventually becoming extinct.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#19:1>
Thus the organism ahead in the evolutionary game is the one that
leaves the most offsprings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#20:1>
Yet, there is no single winner in this game. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#21:1>
Life begets life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#22:1>
In whatever manner life might have originated, once it <O> <&>
page </&> 55 </O> was there, it did not show a going back.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#23:1>
An unbroken continuity and evolution have been maintained.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#24:1>
All life is cellular.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#25:1>
Each one of us starts life as a single cell and develops into
individuals made up of billions of cells which are interrelated,
interacting and intercommunicating.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#26:1>
Every cell has been programmed in a manner that is yet not fully
understood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#27:1>
The inorganic world brought into being the organic world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#28:1>
The history of plant kingdom is as old as the origin of life
itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#29:1>
The first speck of life must have appeared in calm and deep waters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#30:1>
During the primeval time the atmosphere was not as what it is
to-day; it was hostile to life; oxygen, the prime requisite of life today,
developed only through the activity of life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#31:1>
It is deduced that the inorganic elements contained in condensed
vapour by continuous collision with each other formed life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#32:1>
The basic energy for activating these reactions and the prolific
power of carbon to form chain compounds helped in the formation of the first
amino acid and gradually the cell more than 3.5 billion years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#33:1>
Further development of organism and the society of organisms was
facilitated by enrichment of the originally salt-less waters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#34:1>
As time passed, geysers and eruptions brought vast quantities of
minerals into the sea through rivers and springs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#35:1>
The primeval organisms were dominantly ancleated forms which
occupied shallow sloping environments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#36:1>
These forms, both with and without the capacity to make their own
food, dominated <w> earth's </w> biosphere during the first two billion years
of its history. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#37:1>
The earliest organisms were chemoheterotrophs absorbing
necessary nutrients from the surrounding water.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#38:1>
The next organisms that appeared were chemoautotrophs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#39:1>
They obtained their energy by degradation of chemical compounds for
the synthesis of food molecules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#40:1>
These organisms are found in the Galapagos and in deep ocean
thermal springs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#41:1>
Analysis of the biological inter-relationship around these
springs suggests that geothermally produced hydrogen sulfide is the
basic energy source used by chemoautotrophic bacteria to fix carbon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#42:1>
These bacteria not only make their basic food resource but also
form the first step in the food chain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#43:1>
Fossilized remains of <it> <foreign> Thiobacillus </foreign> </it>
and some members of Siderocapsaceae which can reduce sulphate are known from
over 2.66 billion years old Kudremukh iron ore deposits.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#44:1>
Gradually microbes diversified in many low-lying mud
communities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#45:1>
Cells acquired the capability to carry out numerous metabolic
strategies, including fermentation, <O> sketch on column 2 & 3 </O> <O>
caption </O> sulphate reduction and anaerobic photosynthesis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#46:1>
It was the appearance of a molecule called chlorophyll <quote> " a"
</quote> , the mediator of photosynthesis, and its incorporation in
prokaryotic organism known as Cyanobacteria ( blue-green algae) which
triggered important changes in the atmosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#47:1>
A convenient contrivance serving this purpose was the conversion of
carbon dioxide into carbohydrates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#48:1>
From the stand point of energy it is affected most economically by
the photosynthetic activity of these cyanobacteria.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#49:1>
These autotrophic life forms were able to synthesize organic matter
from carbon-dioxide and water with molecular <O> <&> page </&> 56
</O> oxygen released as a metabolic byproduct.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#50:1>
The ultimate result of these changes in the atmosphere was far
reaching for a living system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#51:1>
Cyanobacteria represent the highest level of evolution in the kingdom
Monera.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#52:1>
They generated oxygen photosynthetically and appeared in the
Archaean.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#53:1>
When the oxygen level started rising, chemical and biological
strategies to cope up with this new situation had to be adapted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#54:1>
Many organisms, unable to tolerate the toxicity of this gas, were
permanently driven to anaerobic niches while others first developed
tolerance, then facultative use and eventually the obligate use of
oxygen in metabolism. <O> three square photographs below two columns </O> <O>
caption </O>

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#55:1>
This oxygen, a result of photolysis of water during the
photosynthetic process, accumulated and led to the evolution of
respiring bacteria.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#56:1>
These symbiotic forms probably got merged with other bacteria and
formed eukaryotic cells which through the course of evolution became
multicellular and gave rise to fungi, plants and animals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#57:1>
The first eukaryotes were probably primitive protists - - aerobic
aquatic unicellular organisms whose patterns of cell division and life cycle
can vary from one species to another.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#58:1>
The fossil acritarchs and vase-shaped microfossils from the
Precambrian ( 1,800 million years) sediments probably represent the
earliest records of Protista.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#59:1>
The advent of eukaryotes at this critical juncture probably was
related with increased oxygen levels.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#60:1>
It is also possible that the missing link between prokaryotes and
eukryotes is either missing or yet to be recovered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#61:1>
Evolution is not anticipatory.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#62:1>
Ambiguity in evolution can be traced back to the origin of earlier
forms and they appeared as and when the pressures demanded.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#63:1>
It is also suggested that the origin of eukaryotic cells involved
endosymbiosis, the engulfing of one organism by another, giving rise to cell
organelles such as the mitochondrion and chloroplast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#64:1>
The three defining properties of living system, namely, self
maintenance, growth and reproduction can occur in the total absence of
sex.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#65:1>
Perhaps, the evolution of sex was a biological strategy to meet
the vagaries of environment and an ecological necessity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#66:1>
Or, perhaps at some stage in the distant past certain free-living
single-celled organisms exchanged and / or combined genetic material and
gained advantage over those that did not.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#67:1>
This new means of incorporating adaptive genetic changes presumably
helped in rapidly recombining and forming new individuals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#68:1>
This genetic energy is a driving force and forms a continuum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#69:1>
Favourable traits developed in different individuals were brought
together in one individual.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#70:1>
Thus, the sexual reproduction along with meiosis helped not only in
the recombination of characters but also in developing diverse characters in
the offspring.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#71:1>
Subsequent to the evolution of sex as well as the acquisition of
the filamentous habit another important inevitable event - - death, which
came to control the future course of life itself was ushered in.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#72:1>
The immortal unicell which was capable of several functions,
including reproduction, gave way to mortality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#73:1>
However, advanced life forms could not have developed without this
gift of death.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#74:1>
The birth of death took place at least 1,300 Ma ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#75:1>
Metaphytic organisms most probably evolved from unicellular
protists.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#76:1>
The first stage in the evolution, that is, arrangement of the cells
in linear pattern, is quite common in several filamentous algae.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#77:1>
The next step would have been the formation of plate-like bodies or
sheets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#78:1>
Algal sheets are known both in <it> Vendotaenia </it> , an alga
recorded from <*> + - </*> 1 billion year old sediments of the Vindhyan
Supergroup and <it> ulva </it> , a recent green alga in a marine environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#79:1>
The earliest unicellular prokaryotes were generalists and could
perform all the tasks requisite for survival.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#80:1>
As evolution proceeded, different parts of the organisms took over
for performing of different tasks, thus initiating specialisation and
division of labour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#81:1>
This required first specialised tasks being performed by specialised
organs within the cell and then by specialised cells / tissues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#82:1>
This gave rise to specialised organs like, roots for anchorage and
absorption of nutrients; leaf for photosynthesis and specialised
reproductive organs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#83:1>
How and when the living system adopted the practice of division
of labour delegating the workload to specialised cells or group of cells is
not known.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#84:1>
However, the heterocyst of cyanobacteria takes up the
responsibility of reproduction in adverse conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#85:1>
The earliest multicellular blue-green algae gradually developed
features like branching.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#86:1>
They were still inhabiting the aquatic media where nutrients were
plenty and easily available to all parts of the organism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#87:1>
They required no foraging roots in a medium containing all the
nourishment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#88:1>
Perhaps due to depleting nutritional resources of the early sea the
living system must have felt the need to move and occupy land.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#89:1>
It is remarkable that a similarity exists in the concentrations of
the sea water and our blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#90:1>
The salts from the sea water were taken by animals while moving from
sea to land.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#91:1>
As if to remind this ecological necessity the aquatic media is still
a pre-requisite for fertilization! </p> <O> > <&> page </&> 57 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#92:1>
The Lower Palaeozoic flora in the marine realm was dominated by
the calcareous and non-calcareous algae.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#93:1>
Sea weeds also developed the power to photosynthesize at greater
depths.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#94:1>
The algal flora of Ordovician seas persisted into Silurian which
was the time of rapid development of calcareous green algae.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#95:1>
<it> Prototaxites </it> - - an enigmatic form with ground mass of
small, thin-walled septate, branched, inter woven hyphae and vertical, large
thick-walled, aseptate tube appeared in Silurian.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#96:1>
It may be related to the brown algae or to a higher plant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#97:1>
But presence of tissues distributed as radially elongated masses
that bear crude resemblance to medullary rays, indicates that such forms
perhaps represent intermediate stage between true land plants and their
ancestors probably green algae. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#98:1>
The early plants of aquatic system mostly spent their lives
attached to the sea-floor and continuously bathed in water.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#99:1>
The evolutionary transition from sea to land demanded a variety of
adaptive features.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#100:1>
The first problem was of support.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#101:1>
The atmospheric gases also influenced the gas exchange system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#102:1>
The ecological consequences such as the non-availability of food
supply in air as compared to its availability in water lead to development
and evolution of food supply system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#103:1>
These changes brought about structural changes in trophic levels,
productivity and resource management.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#104:1>
The glaciation during the Ordovician probably had an impact on sea
level and put more stress on plant life which boldly evolved many vegetative
adaptations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#105:1>
The stress tolerant intertidal and sub-tidal algae gradually
explored terrestrial environments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#106:1>
The pressure variations of oxygen in the <w> earth's </w> atmosphere
due to photosynthetic activity of early life forms in aquatic systems
possibly helped inva<l.sion of land by plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#107:1>
The circumstances for the extinction of animals at the terminal
Ordovician were probably a boon to trigger invasion of primitive green
land plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#108:1>
It is suggested that members of Chlorophyceae and Charophyceae
were possible precursors of early land plants as evidenced from molecular
genetics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#109:1>
The early land plants have horizontal mode of habitat.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#110:1>
As they had to grow against the gravity, they evolved structural
support system such as cuticle and mechanical tissues to stay upright.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#111:1>
The underground root system developed for gathering water and
nutrients from soil helped anchor the plant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#112:1>
The internal transport system and reproductive system were
strengthened in response to changing ecological needs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#113:1>
Differential photosynthetic tissue distribution viz-a-viz light
availability and water loss controlling adaptability are novel methods
through which plants managed a gradual balancing system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#114:1>
The evolution <O> > photograph </O> <O> caption </O> of
conducting strands ( as seen in non-vascular plants), cuticle for water
proofing, stomata for gaseous exchange, xylem, ( as seen in vascular
plants) for better upward flow of water and its strengthening by
structural molecule lignin and internal nutrient conducting system through
the development of phloem are some of the unique adaptations of plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#115:1>
Competition for available light encouraged differential growth
patterns and effective adaptations to life in air.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#116:1>
This diversification further aided by appearance of herbs, shrubs
and finally the trees representing distinctive layers where more organisms
could be encompassed within a community.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#117:1>
Often associated with sheets of cuticle are recorded a number of
microfossils that have been referred to as tube or tracheid-like cells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#118:1>
They have been found in fossils of <it> Nematothallus </it> , and
some types are known to occur within the problematic plant <it> Prototaxites
</it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#119:1>
While these <quote> " tubes" </quote> fail to meet the general
criteria of a tracheid, the structural organization does suggest a
functional role of both conduction and support.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#120:1>
Since none of the tubes have been found <it> in situ </it> it is
impossible to state whether they belong to land in,l>habiting embryophytes or
some group of aquatic organisms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#121:1>
Like the cuticle, their significance in the fossil record should be
viewed as an indication of structural adaptation, and not necessarily of
habitat or biological affinity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-024#122:1>
These changes coupled with reproductive adaptations got
integrated over a period of time to deal with relatively desiccating
environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#123:1>
In the earlier stages of this evolution, the gametophyte and the
sporophyte were more or less in competition; eventually moisture requirements
dictated the dominance of sporophyte.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#124:1>
The energy management process channelised appearance of
micro-and mega-spores ultimately leading to the evolution of seed
habit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#125:1>
With the passage of time sexual reproduction increased in
efficiency as a result of which communities slowly became more diversified.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#126:1>
Vegetative adaptations permitted the initial invasion of land
while reproductive mechanism followed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#127:1>
The evolution of seed was an important break-through in land
plant reproductive strategies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#128:1>
The discovry of a <quote> " missing link" </qote> , a new type of
seed in Lower Carboniferous Montague Noire deposit, France, which has no
pollentrapping structure or evident access for the pollen to the female
gametophyte is significant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-024#129:1>
It suggests in intermediate evolutionary stage between
pteridophytic and gymnospermous reproduction and hence is an important
step in evolutionary history. </p> (
