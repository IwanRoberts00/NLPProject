My dear Dr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#3:1>
So gracious of you to have remembered me on the
auspicious  
occasion of the wedding of <indig> Chi </indig> Girish. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#4:1>
Girish whom I remember faintly is in the merchant Navy,
isn't he ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#5:1>
Of late we have lost contact and I really have to make
an effort to  
recall his figure. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#6:1>
How have you been keeping these days ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#7:1>
What have been your pre-occupations ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#8:1>
How are Mr D.S. Kulkarni and his family ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#9:1>
I guess they would all be attending the grand wedding.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#10:1>
<w> I'm </w> afraid I can't make it, but I
certainly will try to  
look you up a few days later. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#11:1>
I have an appointment with Dr Vyas ( at Jalna ) who
has been treating  
me for what looks like semi-blindness <}> <-> of </-> <=> of
</=> </}> right  
eye. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#12:1>
It <}> <-> have </-> <+> has </+> </}> been difficult
to stir out. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#13:1>
I have other disabilities too - - heart, diabetes,
numbness etc. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#14:1>
Inspite of these I continue to work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#15:1>
I expect my book - - English Pronunciation for Marathi
Speakers - -  
will soon be released. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#16:1>
Would you kindly convey our heartfelt
congratulations to Girish  
and Smita on this occasion ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#17:1>
<w> I'm </w> sure Anil, Kulkarni and others would be
present on the  
occasion. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#18:1>
Please remember me to Mrs Kulkarni.

My dear Dr Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#23:1>
Ever so many thanks for your letter of 1 Sept.
which reached me  
only last week. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#24:1>
I was sorry to hear your tale of woe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#25:1>
Now that you are back in Kolhapur I am sure you will
feel all right, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#26:1>
My sight too is none too enviable. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#27:1>
I have lost my right eye, have diabetes for 35 years
and had a heart  
attack about 9 years ago. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#28:1>
I have survived all these. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#29:1>
<w> I'm </w> sure you would be able to complete your
project soon.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#30:1>
My publisher <mention> Saket Prakashan </mention>
will send you a  
copy of my book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#31:1>
If you don't receive it within a week kindly drop me a
line. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#32:1>

Aurangabad 1 Sept 1994. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#36:1>
My dear D.S. 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#37:1>
Another blow ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#38:1>
This time is Prof. H.B. Kulkarni whom you and I knew
so intimately  
H.B. ( Hemant ) passed away last month at Houston ( USA ) . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#39:1>
Of late he had been keeping indifferent health. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#40:1>
He was with his son, Ravi, I presume, when he breathed
his last. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#41:1>
He underwent a surgery at Houston for heart trouble
and died of  
cardiac arrest a day after the operation. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#42:1>
His co-brother Dr Bidkar gave me this piece of news
yesterday. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#43:1>
I thought that the one person I could immediately
share my sorrow <}>  
<-> with </-> <+> which </+> <}> was you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#44:1>
H.B. used to visit his son and daughter, one in
the USA the other  
in England off and on but he loved India and had I think
bought a flat in  
Juhu. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#45:1>
He was very much attached to <mention> Hare Krishna
</mention>  
mission, if my impression is correct. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#46:1>
He wrote to me a couple of times inviting me to stay
with him. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#47:1>
I never could do it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#48:1>
And now we shall never see him again, this slim,
bespectacled,  
civilized soul. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#49:1>
What fun we used to have at Sangli then. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#50:1>
Ravi was an infant. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#51:1>
Mrs. K was a hospitable and an </}> <-> accomodating
</-> <+> accommodating </+> <}> person. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#52:1>
Then at Hyderabad in 1960 when Prof Gokak was at the
C.I.E. He was  
utterly miserable at the University due to internal politics. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#53:1>
He often said that he found solace in my company. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#54:1>
I kept on visiting him almost everyday and he used <+>
to </+> unfold his agony. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#55:1>
Another year in 1964-65 when I was Research fellow at
the C I E. ! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#56:1>
How often we met. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#57:1>
Then the storm had not blown over. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#58:1>
He was still unhappy and finally the plunge he took to
leave the  
country and go to the USA. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#59:1>
What a loss. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#60:1>
H.B. has several vols of poetry in English to his
credit. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#61:1>
I wonder if we could do something to perpetuate
his memory at  
W.C. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#62:1>
Is it possible ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#63:1>
Least ways would you be able to write an article on
him ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#64:1>
If I get some information I will pass it on to you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#65:1>
But it seems Dr. Bidkar was not quite thick with him.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#66:1>
How is everybody at home? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#67:1>
How are Prabhakar and family? </p>

Aurangabad 26 Oct 1994. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#71:1>
My dear Dhiranna, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#72:1>
I have taken a long time over your letter, partly
because of a  
slight setback to my health and partly because I had to work
for the copy of  
very excellent translation of Yashwant <w> Chittal's </w>
seminal article. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#73:1>
<w> It's </w> a well-thought out article - and the
translation is  
faithful and carries conviction. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#74:1>
The writer is as candid and as percepture as the
translator. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#75:1>
I know from my own experience how difficult
translation could be. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#76:1>
I would rather write 100 pages of <del> myself </del>
my own than  
tranlsate 10 pages You have written. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#77:1>
And yet translation, not transcreation, is the only
way to break the  
barriers that exist between linguistic groups. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#78:1>
If we are to survive as Indians we have to keep on
doing  
translations. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#79:1>
<w> It's </w> a pity the Sahitya Academy has not
trained a team of  
professional translators. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#80:1>
Soviet Russia, ( 1962 ) had an excellent army of
translators. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#81:1>
I recall how a girl in her teens, translated the
reception speech in  
our honour in three languages. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#82:1>
Well, how is Padma now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#83:1>
She is still Padma to me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#84:1>
I wrote to Mr Panchsheel soon after I received your
letter I hope she  
is improving fast. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#85:1>
Yes, H.B. deserves a mention in the Amrit Mahotsav
Journal. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#86:1>
You alone <w> I'm </w> afraid, will be able to do
justice to his  
personality. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#87:1>
I will pass on whatever information I can ferret out
here. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#88:1>
I have my limitations. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#89:1>
I can't venture out alone. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#90:1>
My vision - - which was never very clear - - has got
dimmer. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#91:1>
My <?> gait </?> is unsteady, my memory is a seive. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#92:1>
And yet we continue to drag on. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#93:1>
My wife is no better. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#94:1>
She has still to do the household chores and gets
tired. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#95:1>
<w> There's </w> no relief. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#96:1>
Health permitting I would like to attend to
Platinum Jubilee. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#97:1>
<w> What's </w> the TM collector like ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#98:1>
Any idea ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#99:1>
Mrs Joshi keeps on writing to me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#100:1>
I owe her a letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#101:1>

My dear Dhiranna, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#159:1>
May I reverse the order of your letter and say
how deeply I was  
touched to read about <indig> Shri </indig> <w> Panchawagh's
</w> sad demise. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#160:1>
We got to know about your bereavement through Meene
Parcharak. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#161:1>
I wrote to Padma condoling his passing away. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#162:1>
I wonder whether she received the letter or not. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#163:1>
It must have been such a bad shock to her. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#164:1>
The account you have given me of the quiet suffering
of Satyasheel  
only shows the stuff he was made of. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#165:1>
I hope Padma / you write an account of his life based
on the diary  
he has left behind. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#166:1>
How have you been keeping of late ? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#167:1>
I have completely lost my right eye. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#168:1>
<w> I'm </w> now a one-eyed man. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#169:1>
And yet I keep on telling my friends <quote> ` In the
country of the

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-006#170:1>
And now about the book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#171:1>
Your suggestions are eminently sensible. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#172:1>
<w> I'll </w> try to incorporate them in the next
edition of the  
book, if there is one. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#173:1>
Please request Vedavati to go through it and make
suggestions. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#174:1>
Some found it difficult my friend D.Y. Deshpande (
Nagpur ) wrote to  
say it was a formidable book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#175:1>
Some of course dismissed it cheaply. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#176:1>
There has not yet been any serious attempt to review
it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#177:1>
I wrote to Prof. M.D. Hatanglekar to review any one
of the three  
books published on 6 June. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#178:1>
There has not been a reply to my letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#179:1>
Dr. Jahagirdar and his departmental colleagues seem
to like it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#180:1>
Of course it is for those interested into a subject
of Contrastive Phonology. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#181:1>
Writing the book has been a rewarding experience for
me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-006#182:1>
