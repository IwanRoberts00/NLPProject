<ICE-IND:S2B-031#1:1:A>
If you want me to talk on uh <,> <mention> Yakshagana  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#2:1:A>
I can only talk on things that I have concerned myself with <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#3:1:A>
<mention> Yakshagana </mention> is an art form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#4:1:A>
I have been very much interested in popular <,,> folk art <,,> as  
well as the theatrical art of Karnataka <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#5:1:A>
That means the commercial theatre <,,> with their <,,>  
music-cum-prose <,,> scenery and spectacular elements <,,> on the stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#6:1:A>
As a student <,,> as a youth <,,> we had so many of the theatrical  
companies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#7:1:A>
I was exposed to them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#8:1:A>
I had a fancy for these things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#9:1:A>
Later on <,,> I <,> had <,,> impressions of the Maharashtra theatre  
<,,> its music <,,> its social place and all that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#10:1:A>
Here <,,> one particular element interested me <,,> is this <,,>  
you speak prose <,,> you get angry <,,> and then you sing a song <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#11:1:A>
The same substance is carried <,,> the same object is carried  
through two different mediums <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#12:1:A>
In dance <,> you do foot work <,,> you sing <,,> you gesturise <,,>  
and so many things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#13:1:A>
This put me into the <,> problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#14:1:A>
What can each do <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#15:1:A>
What can prose do ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#16:1:A>
What can music do ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#17:1:A>
What can dance do ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#18:1:A>
And what can they not do <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#19:1:A>
Therefore for a quite a number of years <,,> I experimented <,> in  
pure prose plays <,,> pure mime plays <,> pure musicals <,> pure folk  
musicals <,> and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#20:1:A>
With this element <,,> I began to tackle <,,> the Yakshagana  
theatre as such <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#21:1:A>
For I felt <,> it was very very rich in music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#22:1:A>
In the sense <,,> the words that they speak out <,> in music <,> is  
so rich <,> and totally <}> <-> relevated </-> <,> <=> relevant </=> </}> <,>  
to the subject matter <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#23:1:A>
What does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a  
<indig> raga </indig> or a <indig> tala </indig> or any technical element <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#24:1:A>
Just as grammar is not literature <,> so technique <,> is not art  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#25:1:A>
Technique is meant for a purpose <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#26:1:A>
You use it for <,> giving it a shape to your emotions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#27:1:A>
Here what are the emotions in <mention> Yakshgana </mention> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#28:1:A>
What are the topics <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#29:1:A>
When it comes to the question of <}> <-> tapic </-> <=> topic </=>  
</}> <,> you know we are taking Mahabharata plays 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#30:1:A>
We are not concerned with <,> Karna or Kaurava or <,> or any  
<indig> rakshasa </indig> <,> any saint <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#31:1:A>
We are common people our experience for <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#32:1:A>
So naturally you have to imagine these characters <,,> from how do  
they think <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#33:1:A>
So how do you dress them ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#34:1:A>
Do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#35:1:A>
In that way <mention> Yakshagana </mention> had one of the very  
richest element from nineteen thirty onwards <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#36:1:A>
And many European scholars come and see <,> the costume and make up  
<,> of <mention> Yakshagana </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#37:1:A>
It was so interesting <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#38:1:A>
Even in those days <,> there were old people who could <}> <-> give  
</-> <+> show </+> </}> any <indig> rakshasa </indig> <}> <-> <.> chara </.>  
</-> <=> character </=> </}> <,> in a different type <,> and valourous  
character in a different type and common people in common dress <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#39:1:A>
This was the element that attracted them <,> that attracted me too  
<,> on the stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#40:1:A>
But at the same time <,> I felt so many things jarring <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#41:1:A>
There are the female characters <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#42:1:A>
Say in a play <mention> Satyabhama </mention> and Rukmini come or  
<mention> Panchvati </mention> play <,> the Seeta comes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#43:1:A>
Seeta comes in an ordinary dress <,> along with Rama coming in a  
different <,> old time costume <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#44:1:A>
This disharmony again <,,> disturbed me <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#45:1:A>
It is not only that <,> there were so many other questions raised 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#46:1:A>
We have got musical instruments <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#47:1:A>
There is the drum <,,> there is the Bhagwat <,,> and there is the  
dance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#48:1:A>
Bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many <indig> ragas  
</indig> and beautifully written songs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#49:1:A>
But sitting down on the stage <,> can you make sense <-> out </->  
of even one word that he sings <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#50:1:A>
He shouts <,> he screeches <,> and to outwit him there is the  
Himmela <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#51:1:A>
The Himmela in most of our dancers <,> are Mummela <,> they dictate  
terms to a dancer <,> they do not follow him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#52:1:A>
So naturally what happens is <,> you don't even hear a single word  
of the Bhagwat <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#53:1:A>
You <}> <-> <.> hea </.> </-> <=> hear </=> </}> him screeching <,>  
and you hear the drum play and all these things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#54:1:A>
This irrelevence <,> with <,> enough material of our own <,> enough  
<indig> ragas </indig> enough instruments enough judgement <,> what is wrong  
with us <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#55:1:A>
We have begun to admire technique <,> cleverness for its sake <,>  
shrieking for its sake <,> the drum beating for its sake <,> not for  
application of these things to give <O> one word </O> I want 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#56:1:A>
You want me to talk <,> why <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#57:1:A>
To show that I am clever in talking that I can use bombastic words  
<,> or <,> to show that I have something to say about the proposed subject  
Yakshagana <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#58:1:A>
That means <,,> reference of the content the form is every thing in  
art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#59:1:A>
By itself <,> things may be beautiful <,> but you are using certain  
things to project <,> to communicate a story of the <mention> Mahabharata  
</mention> and all these things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#60:1:A>
Naturally when we take these things <,> when you come on the stage  
with uh <,,> a monstrous character a Ravana <,> and other characters <,> and  
if you bring in Seeta in ordinary dress I should feel that he has stolen the  
<,> girl from the audience there <,,> and she doesn't form <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#61:1:A>
Similarly in costume <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#62:1:A>
In old costume <-> they strict </-> some great man created the  
rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things <,> in terms of colour  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#63:1:A>
In terms of painting <,,> some clever fellow did it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#64:1:A>
There is a harmony between what colours they have chosen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#65:1:A>
It doesn't <-> the </-> belong <,> to the type of uh thinking as in  
Kerala the <indig> satvik rajsik </indig> and <indig> tamsik </indig> forms  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#66:1:A>
Colour harmony is a different element 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#67:1:A>
Combination of <,> light elements <,> pigment elements <,> and <,>  
on that basis <,> they have <,> done super <,> work so far as many characters  
are concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#68:1:A>
But <,,> no costume <,> no ornament <,> for the lady character <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#69:1:A>
The lady character <}> <-> brings the </-> <+> is brought </+> </}>  
<,> to be coquettish and woo the audience <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#70:1:A>
She may be the <,> Seeta <,> in talk and these things you are the  
men audiences to be wooed by shiny <,> or <,> very cinema like <,> fans on  
the screen <,,> so they begin to come with the most <,> beautiful gaudy <,>  
with make-up powder <,> lipsticks <,> and <,> any silk 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#71:1:A>
Now today you have got <,> glaring dresses of any sort <,,> you  
begin to wear it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#72:1:A>
In Kathakali <,> <w> we've </w> got a fine breast plate <,> you  
have got a heap of beads on it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#73:1:A>
Why do you want the breast plate <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#74:1:A>
That means <,> you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and  
colour harmony in costume itself <,> in dress <O> one word </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#75:1:A>
Our Yakshagana dresses I have got certain things like this <,> over  
<,> a <,> grey or red jacket <,> one is complementary to the other in terms  
of colour harmony <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#76:1:A>
Then you put <,,> garlands <,> you put beads <,> and glass tubes  
and then if somebody presents a <,,> a jasmine <,> you put that also <,> more  
the merrier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#77:1:A>
Absolutely there is no sense of the stage <,,> colour harmony 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#78:1:A>
A stage is a <,> painting <,> where characters have to stand in  
respective places <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#79:1:A>
Each man has to balance somebody else <,> forward <,> backward in  
terms of colour <,> in terms of form in terms of emotion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#80:1:A>
Suppose you have got the Pandavas <,,> sculptured out by a <,,> a  
great Chola artist <,> how would he make them stand one another <,,> not  
figures like this <,> not presenting the characters <,> in a form that all  
the forms <,> blend together <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#81:1:A>
An artist like Rodan in building the hell <,> Gates of Paradise <,>  
brings in a hundred forms <,,> one is harmonious to the other 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#82:1:A>
So <,> the stage has to be conceived <,> in terms of people who is  
there 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#83:1:A>
I drive away the musician there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#84:1:A>
I don't want the musicians <,> behind to distort <,> the shape of  
the beautiful characters <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#85:1:A>
They may be very important but their music could be heard <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#86:1:A>
So these are the elements form and content <,> in terms of music  
and these things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#87:1:A>
One big thing came to me is <,,> you take the <indig> raga </indig>  
and the <indig> tala </indig> elements your beat you are very perfect you are  
great artist in training <,> you never go wrong <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#88:1:A>
But do you sing the same thing ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#89:1:A>
I remember one day <,> a play like <,,> a <,,> a gypsy comes and  
asks Seeta <,> did you see Ravana ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#90:1:A>
No I have not seen him <,> I might have seen his leg <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#91:1:A>
Alright draw a picture of the leg <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#92:1:A>
Then she completes and makes it a Ravana <,> and Rama comes <,> he  
says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming <,> of Ravana <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#93:1:A>
Then the punishment <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#94:1:A>
Summary <,,> is Laxman take her and chop her head off <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#95:1:A>
She is taken <,> most pathetic situation the drum beating Chandi is  
as if <,> you are taking a number of sheep to the Kali temple <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#96:1:A>
This is what happens in every thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#97:1:A>
In every classical form you see <indig> thai thak thai thai thak  
thai thai thak thai </indig> <,> and the song is <indig> shringara </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#98:1:A>
Is it <indig> shringara </indig> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#99:1:A>
It is terrific <indig> shringara </indig> then <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#100:1:A>
This is what made me think <,,> how to sing <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#101:1:A>
How to dance <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#102:1:A>
This is the step work maybe same <indig> tala </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#103:1:A>
She is in a sorrow position <,,> wailing all through <,> how does  
she present herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#104:1:A>
We confine <indig> tala </indig> rhythm <,> to the leg <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#105:1:A>
Emotion is a body element <,> there is the child that can get  
angry <,,> joyful <,> every element of the body is seen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#106:1:A>
Leg and <indig> tala </indig> is not confined to the legs alone  
<,,> to every moment of the rhythm <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#107:1:A>
The whole body has to respond to an emotion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#108:1:A>
So in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on  
the stage <,> in terms of voice <,> in terms of so many things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#109:1:A>
Is there no individuality ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#110:1:A>
Have you to repeat it <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#111:1:A>
Then there are so many things <,> on the stage which we think of  
<,> where emotions are strife <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#112:1:A>
All Yakshagana plays are epical plays <,> <mention> Mahabharata  
</mention> plays <,> or conflicts of emotion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#113:1:A>
They can give you a full range of things <,> on the stage if you  
want to do it if you want to <,> feel it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#114:1:A>
But how would you do it <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#115:1:A>
Our <indig> guru </indig> taught us like this to hold the hands  
and go like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#116:1:A>
The <indig> guru </indig> seems to be a ghost <,,> for chasing  
people <,> and artists <,> to the length of her <,> entire transformation of  
souls <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#117:1:A>
You are there to feel as an actor <,,> evoke what best is there  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#118:1:A>
What best do you give <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#119:1:A>
Now I take it <,> a question that is posed to <mention> Yakshagana  
</mention> and our music also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#120:1:A>
Our music <}> <- > is </-> <+> in </+> </}> <mention> Yakshagana  
</mention> may be classical music <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#121:1:A>
Why do you sing <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#122:1:A>
Does it contain words <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#123:1:A>
For what was it created <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#124:1:A>
What are the words <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#125:1:A>
The words say something <,,> your <indig> tala </indig> says  
something <,> your <indig> raga </indig> says that you are very clever you  
can <,> sing for half an hour <,,> or even one hour a <indig> raga </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#126:1:A>
But <,> what is the word that you say <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#127:1:A>
This is everything <,,> I can uh <,,> there is a Hindustani song  
<,,> who is as great as Rama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#128:1:A>
The word is <,> <indig> aiso <,> koudara <,> jagamai </indig> in  
the whole world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#129:1:A>
There is none to beat Rama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#130:1:A>
Why <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#131:1:A>
Because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know <,,> these  
people <,> for years together prayed Rama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#132:1:A>
Without praising anything doing anything <,> he blessed the <,>  
Vaccha <,> Jatayu <,> he blessed the Kubja <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#133:1:A>
So <,,> there is none like Rama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#134:1:A>
If I say the word <indig> aiso koudar jagamaai </indig> in the  
whole world <,,> <indig> koudar </indig> <w> it's </w> acclamation in sound  
<,> <indig> jagamaai </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#135:1:A>
Why <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#136:1:A>
<indig> Vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara  
Ramasarisakonahi koudar </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#137:1:A>
Every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint  
or somebody else <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#138:1:A>
Similarly <,,> Yakshagana songs or every song <,,> is a reflection  
of an emotion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#139:1:A>
How do you mouth it <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#140:1:A>
Yakshagana is very heroic <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#141:1:A>
I thump the beat and I show that I am very rigorous <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#142:1:A>
Are you heroic even in death even in pathos ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#143:1:A>
Means even if before your child dies there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#144:1:A>
It should make sense <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#145:1:A>
In which case Yakshagana is an element <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#146:1:A>
I think to me it is greater than classical element <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#147:1:A>
For this one thing <,,> classical music was written by <,> Savants  
<,,> who were mostly saints <,,> mostly saints <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#148:1:A>
They were reclusers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#149:1:A>
They were sorry for the birth of man 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#150:1:A>
They were sorry for <,> <}> <-> any anything </-> <+> everything  
</+> </}> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#151:1:A>
So they used to either sing the praise of the Lord <,> or say O  
Lord <,> why did you bring me to earth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#152:1:A>
But a drama contains ever so many other emotions <,,> joy valour  
jealousy and all these things 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#153:1:A>
It must lend them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#154:1:A>
It is there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#155:1:A>
I can I <}> <-> end end </-> <=> end </=> </}> my <,,> short talk  
by giving one note of the Yakshagana song <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#156:1:A>
In the battle after the third battle third day <,,> Duryodhana  
begins to weep <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#157:1:A>
We have lost all rounds <,> O Dronacharya <,> where is the hope  
for us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#158:1:A>
There is no hope <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#159:1:A>
Because <,,> the great demon killer <,,> Krishana <,,> is <w>  
Arjuna's </w> charioteer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#160:1:A>
The man whom I had trusted Vidura has given away and gone away  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#161:1:A>
The great commander my grandfather Bheeshma is lying <,> on a bed  
of arrows <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#162:1:A>
What shall I do <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#163:1:A>
Now I will give you the Kannada word <,> <indig> yena madali nanu  
</indig> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#164:1:A>
What shall I do <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#165:1:A>
For what purpose <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#166:1:A>
To defeat the Pandavas <,> <indig> Pandavara solipade </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#167:1:A>
Why <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#168:1:A>
<indig> Danava takanavanu <,> avage sarathiya agianu </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#169:1:A>
The great demon killer <,> Krishna is a charioteer for Arjuna 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#170:1:A>
Then <,,> my friend Vidura <,,> broke his <,,> bow <,> went away  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#171:1:A>
Then Bheeshma is lying <,,> there almost dead <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#172:1:A>
What shall I do <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#173:1:A>
This mood for an actor can come in ten different ways <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#174:1:A>
It depends <,> upon his liking <,,> of somebody else his hatred or  
jealous <,> his despondency <,> his sorrow for this sake <,> <indig> Yena  
madali nanu <,> pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#175:1:A>
Yena madali nanu pandavara solipade Danavantak-navage sarathiya  
agianu </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#176:1:A>
Ten different moods can be depicted 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#177:1:A>
Do you beat your drum to suit the mood <,,> or anything <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#178:1:A>
So we can build up a great art even today <,> we have got enough  
material from the past 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#179:1:A>
Why our <,> tradition to be preserved is <,> though we have not  
used it sensibly 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#180:1:A>
We have enough materials <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#181:1:A>
In music we have a thousand <indig> ragas </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#182:1:A>
How many emotions have I given expression to <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#183:1:A>
Sometimes <,,> we are perverse <,> we are praying <,,> Vinayak  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#184:1:A>
In what manner <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#185:1:A>
<indig> Vatapi Ganapatim bhajihum va </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#186:1:A>
You are clapping Ganapati it is a praise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#187:1:A>
This perversion why does it happen <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#188:1:A>
You are a votary of grammar <,> thinking grammar is <,,> art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#189:1:A>
Grammar is that art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#190:1:A>
It is this way we can do a lot <,> and a lot can be done <,> to  
preserve or show the greatness <,> of our own art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#191:1:A>
Showing by our skill about art is totally different <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#192:1:A>
You can admire me you can admire anybody <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-031#193:1:A>
But show the potentiality of the Indian art <,,> how it relates to  
the expression of the human urge <,> in ways of art I think I have bored you  
enough <,,> </I>
