<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#1:1:A>
Well <,> <-> the </-> they represent not so expert <?> little
</?> warden <,,> and uh <,> <w> they're </w> planning to <O> one word </O>
<,> as a <O> one word </O> of <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#2:1:B>
What was the main reason for that <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#3:1:A>
No <}> <-> particularly </-> <+> particular </+> </}> reason at
all <,,> just <,> and we feel that he is not caring about his job <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#4:1:A>
Hardly ever comes to the mess and all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#5:1:B>
Or do the students demand something <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#6:1:A>
No no no no we <w> we've </w> got I think all things that we
need <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#7:1:A>
But so far the warden has never been <,,> quite good in his job <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#8:1:A>
He hardly ever comes to the mess <w> he's </w> supposed to look
after the food and all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#9:1:A>
He doesn't come <{> <[> to the mess </[> at all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#10:1:B>
<[> Ah ha ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#11:1:B>
Just he atleast food about the <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#12:1:A>
<w> He's </w> least bothered about anything <{> <[> except his
</[> uh residence and <,,> telephone and all those things

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#13:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#14:1:B>
But <,> don't you find any other way to convince him that <,>
to show him how <,> by some other means

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#15:1:A>
No we tried to convince him but unfortunately <,> <w> he's
</w> beyond convincing <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#16:1:B>
Uhn but I think that this is the usual problem in almost all
the hostels of <,> D U <,> <{> <[> uh <,> that the authorities when they get
<,,> uhm residence didn't pay attention <,> on <,> hostel its <,>
organisation <,,> this is the usual problem <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#17:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#18:1:A>
So in all the cases these the students feel that the
authorities are doing nothing then the <{> <[> authorities should be <O> one
word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#19:1:B>
<[> Yeah yeah you people </[> </{> are justified and what I am
saying <,,> uh that maybe <,> that uh <,> are something which uh <,> which
directly affects to the students <w> that's </w> why these people are very
much <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#20:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#21:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#22:1:A>
<w> That's </w> it <,> <{> <[> uh <,> and <?> the </?> thing
is that the managing body and other things they are supporting

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#23:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#24:1:B>
How about the other <O> one word </O> part <O> one word </O>
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#25:1:A>
They are okay <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#26:1:B>
Okay and uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#27:1:A>
They are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any
problems

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#28:1:B>
Ah ha <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#29:1:A>
The warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but
<,> he was useless <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#30:1:A>
As a matter of fact <}> <-> if we if we </-> <=> if we </=> </}>
don't have any authorities at all <w> we're </w> better off <,> <{> <[> ah ha
<,> I think that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#31:1:B>
<[> Ah ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#32:1:B>
What about your R T <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#33:1:A>
<w> He's </w> okay <,> okay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#34:1:B>
He is doing his post uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#35:1:A>
Yeah <,> well whatever we tell him to do he does <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#36:1:B>
Was the concept of R T as the <O> one word </O> post

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#37:1:A>
No concept at all <,> I don't know about any concept

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#38:1:A>
Why don't you <O> two words </O> any authority in the hostel <,>
especially in our hostel <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#39:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#40:1:A>
Or we don't just care about that authorities <,> we do
whatever we want

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#41:1:B>
Oh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#42:1:A>
I thought you just say yes and <O> one word </O> sign of the
<{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#43:1:B>
<[> I </[> </{> came to know that <,> in <O> one word </O>
every hostel is like an institution <,> and so <,> <w> that's </w> why <w>
they've </w> appointed one R T <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> with other trainee <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#44:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#45:1:A>
The question is may be <,> <{> <[> uh </[> that was the basic
answer

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#46:1:A>
But our hostel I don't think has <,> is an exception as <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#47:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#48:1:B>
<w> It's </w> an exception <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#49:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#50:1:B>
And if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in <,>
fortunate enough to get uh <,> R T uhm <,,> like you see we have

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#51:1:A>
Ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example <{1> <[1>
it is <O> two words </O> </[1> rowdy and all then <{2> <[2> the new </[2> <,>
for whose <O> one word </O> he started kicking off the students without <,,>
uh <{3> <[3> <O> one word </O> </[3>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#52:1:B>
<[1> These problem are there </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#53:1:C>
<[2> Yeah yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#54:1:B>
<[3> Problems </[3> </{3> are there problems are there what
<w> I'm </w> saying is that <,> uh <w> we've </w> got an R T <,> who does
care about the study of the students

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#55:1:A>
Study of the students

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#56:1:B>
Yeah <,> because if suppose you have got some problem in <.>
ge </.> getting your <,> things done <,> then he will come and ask <,>
<quote> okay if you have any problem just say don't hesitate and <O> one word
</O> </quote>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#57:1:A>
I don't know <,> no our R T doesn't do that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#58:1:A>
Our R T just comes <{> <[> once in a while </[> shakes hand with
all the boys <,> then <,,> we start talking to him and he talks back <,> we
talk about all the <.> to </.> topic except the hostel topics

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#59:1:B>
<[> Still you people are <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#60:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#61:1:A>
And <,> anything <w> that's </w> just <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#62:1:B>
So <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> what do you think that <,> just their
target was to get uh <,> get the <O> two words </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#63:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#64:1:A>
Yeah yeah <w> that's </w> the main thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#65:1:A>
They are not interested at all in this welfare of the students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#66:1:A>
Why should a person care ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#67:1:A>
Why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family
rather than <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> <w> he'll </w> come and start looking after
boys <,> who know very little <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#68:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#69:1:B>
Yeah and uh <,> what manner you people are approaching to the
higher authorities ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#70:1:A>
No <w> we've </w> the higher authorities to just uh <,> give
the <w> warden's </w> notice <,> they refused so we are planning to go on a
hunger strike <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#71:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#72:1:A>
Fast unto death <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#73:1:B>
When <w> you'll </w> start <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#74:1:A>
It was supposed to start from today but the managing committee
has asked <,> <{> <[> yes <,> that give some more time <{> <[> to <O> one
word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#75:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#76:1:B>
<[> But don't </[> </{> you think that uh <,> its good to uh
<.> in </.> to inform other hostelers also means some hostel <,> <O> one word
</O> of other

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#77:1:A>
Well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own
hostel so why <{> <[> should they do </[> anything about our hostel

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#78:1:B>
<[> You you should just </[> </{> just inform that these
people

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#79:1:A>
No that was therefore <w> I'll </w> tell you one thing <,> my
hostel is far far better from the other hostel <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#80:1:B>
Uh ah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#81:1:A>
Atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like
that but <,> jubilee couldn't <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#82:1:A>
Now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case <w>
it's </w> impossible for the police man to enter

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#83:1:B>
But I think <{> <[> that </[> uh <,> there were people <,> in
jubilee case they <,> they attracted with the hostel itself <,> uh <O> one
word </O> also and <O> one word </O> <,> and they two have given some <,>
some sort of uh statement in papers <,> regarding the students <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#84:1:A>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#85:1:A>
Well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#86:1:A>
We must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee
was wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#87:1:A>
That there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and
they have never been enroll in any <,,> uh department <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#88:1:A>
It was a matter of fact that <{> <[> sort of </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#89:1:B>
<[> But do you </[> </{> do you think that this is the fault
of the students only ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#90:1:A>
This is the fault of students only <,> <{> <[> because </[>
the students themselves

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#91:1:B>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#92:1:B>
Authorities I suppose

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#93:1:A>
No no no <,> if the students uh <,> do one thing you know <,>
they can't do anything <,> they will just keep quite

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#94:1:A>
There are two types of students <,> one is that uh <,,> cool type

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#95:1:A>
<w> He'll </w> just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about
what <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> exactly is going around

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#96:1:A>
Other type is that type <w> they'll </w> just interact with those
very hoodlums <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#97:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#98:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#99:1:A>
Just to be on the safe side

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#100:1:B>
Yeah yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#101:1:A>
Now this is two types

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#102:1:A>
The cool type will never do anything

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#103:1:A>
And the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#104:1:B>
But this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#105:1:A>
At that time I think it is the duty of the authorities to
just have the matter straight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#106:1:A>
<w> I've </w> heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee
people <w> I'll </w> say <,> appreciated it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#107:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#108:1:A>
Particularly lot of uh <,> the many guys <{> <[> who were
arrested in mid-terms </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#109:1:B>
<[> No because the image </[> </{> so see <,> the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#110:1:A>
<w> That's </w> important

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#111:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#112:1:A>
But it never went to that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#113:1:B>
Created in the paper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#114:1:A>
No no no <,> now see in our hostel that is different <,>
because we realise <,> of course there are a couple of students we just <,,>
mean they just seem to stay without

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#115:1:B>
Just listen this really is one very important thing

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#116:1:B>
That any <.> uni uni </.> university especially in post-graduate
courses <,> there is no clearcut <,> I mean time limit for <,> session <,>
and so you see in hostel <{> <[> they will say </[> you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#117:1:A>
<[> No no no </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#118:1:A>
There is a clearcut <,> <{> <[> no <,> time limit <,> but <{>
<[> then only for those people </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#119:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#120:1:B>
<[> How only somebody has got </[> </{> some problem in
enrollment <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#121:1:A>
This is its only for those people who don't have much say <,>
who can't shout <,> <w> it's </w> only for those

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#122:1:A>
Rules are there but they apply only to people who are

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#123:1:B>
How could people were living from six or seven years and
nobody went and asked <{> <[> that these people were </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#124:1:A>
<[> Because there is sort of <indig> gadbad </indig> </[>
</{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#125:1:A>
That does us <,> <w> that's </w> it <,> that does us <,> they
seem to take out a knife <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#126:1:B>
<[> No it is <,> no because </[> </{> even authorities what
<w> I'm </w> saying that the authorities were were the main responsible
persons you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#127:1:B>
That they did not take care of the hostel and after that when
somebody is dropped there and it is there <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#128:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#129:1:B>
Some personal interest <w> that's </w> why they <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#130:1:A>
The authorities in the beginning for example take your <,>
this Pundit was there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#131:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#132:1:A>
See what he <-> is </-> used to do he used to interact with
those very people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#133:1:A>
And if he wanted to get <{> <[> somebody <O> one word </O> </[>
going down in a very bad way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#134:1:A>
He used to meet them and he used to manage that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#135:1:B>
<[> So he uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#136:1:B>
No he was a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#137:1:A>
But he didn't get <O> one word </O> in it

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#138:1:A>
He doesn't want their help because <w> I've </w> heard that he
himself claim to be a <indig> goonda </indig> or something he was a <indig>
goonda </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#139:1:B>
Yeah yeah <w> that's </w> what <w> I'm </w> saying

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#140:1:A>
No he is not afraid of those people <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#141:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#142:1:A>
But the Pundit he <,,> because of his own act <,> he used to
do it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#143:1:B>
No he

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#144:1:A>
He used to take the help of those

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#145:1:B>
He <,> he never he never did take help

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#146:1:A>
<w> I've </w> <w> I've </w> heard there was one chap in uh
<,> jubilee who said that uh <quote> I can't do anything about <,> uh this
guy <,> uh Pundit because see <,> he has helped me he has given the hostel to
this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave <O> one word </O>
to this person because of my <O> one word </O> </quote>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#147:1:B>
Uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#148:1:A>
But the thing is in our case <,> <w> that's </w> it if its
okay <,> in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities
<O> one word </O> it is not corrupt <,> they can't do anything <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#149:1:B>
No but you see

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#150:1:A>
And students were supported

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#151:1:B>
Students or you see a <{> <[> student cannot </[> be <,> a
very gentleman

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#152:1:A>
<[> <O> Two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#153:1:A>
No no <w> I'll </w> tell you <,> in my hostel there are about
<,> ten boys <,> who are sort of <,,> <indig> dadas </indig> you can say
clearcut <indig> dadas </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#154:1:A>
And there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say
who are this cool type

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#155:1:A>
Okay this ten people will go <,> fifty people will be watching
their particular programme on T V <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#156:1:A>
And uh these ten people will go <,> and <w> they'll </w> do all of
a sudden <w> they'll </w> come without saying anything they will simply turn
the channel <,> to the particular programme they are <{> <[> are not </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#157:1:B>
<[> Then you can </[> </{> thus agree it was the authorities
were <{> <[> responsible there </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#158:1:A>
<[> Wait wait </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#159:1:A>
What happened is they will change programme and the fifty
guys <w> they'll </w> just keep quite <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#160:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of
fifty guys who just keep quite <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#161:1:A>
Why do they keep quite <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#162:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#163:1:A>
Okay if I want to watch <{> <[> that programme </[> that is
not my <O> one word </O> I have to fight for it <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>
otherwise I can't watch it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#164:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#165:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#166:1:B>
Yeah no doubt <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#167:1:A>
There are two things only <,> either you join those people
<,> or you fight those people <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#168:1:B>
No there are

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#169:1:A>
And one thing about those people is when they realise that
somebody is capable of fighting them back <,> they will just join him they
will just keep him in <,> means they have very good term with him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#170:1:B>
All the <O> one word </O> which is temporary you know
controversial matter <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#171:1:A>
No no no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#172:1:B>
But after all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#173:1:A>
I don't think <w> it's </w> a controversial

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#174:1:B>
What do you think about your department infact uh <,,> about
your study and the way they teach <,> students here <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#175:1:A>
Well fine <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#176:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#177:1:A>
Uhm <w> it's </w> okay <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#178:1:B>
Do you think that there should be something else which should
be included <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#179:1:A>
No I don't think <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#180:1:A>
I think <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#181:1:B>
It should be

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#182:1:A>
No no department okay <,> syllabus is also okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#183:1:A>
The teachers are okay <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#184:1:B>
And they give proper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#185:1:A>
Only thing is that uh <,,> the avenue should be <,,> large
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#186:1:B>
Avenue should be

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#187:1:A>
Job avenues and all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#188:1:B>
Facilities

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#189:1:A>
There is no job avenue <,> facilities are also okay I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#190:1:B>
No no facilities to students and those <,,> who get get the
degree

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#191:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#192:1:B>
They didn't have an opportunity

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#193:1:A>
There don't have any opportunity

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#194:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#195:1:A>
Almost zero <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#196:1:B>
<w> That's </w> why no instrumnetal motivation and <,> just
adding <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#197:1:A>
<O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#198:1:A>
A zero

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#199:1:B>
<w> That's </w> very good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#200:1:B>
Ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this
department uh during late evening too <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#201:1:B>
That the students come

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#202:1:A>
No it is difference difference in the students <,> I don't
think students <,> feel that there is any need of it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#203:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#204:1:A>
I think just <O> two words </O> I have been here now for I
think three and half years and I feel <w> it's </w> okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#205:1:A>
It depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can
just go to lab and study whatsoever you like <,> and if you feel the need of

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#206:1:B>
They all think that we cannot study but they if they want to
<.> co co </.> consult

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#207:1:A>
He can he can consult <,> I don't think there is any problem
so far <w> I've </w> never faced any problem

<ICE-IND:S1A-083#208:1:A>
Whenever I feel somehow <,> <w> I've </w> gone to any Professor
and he has been very glad to help me <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#209:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-083#210:1:A>
