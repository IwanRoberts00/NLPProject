<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#1:1:A>
In all good ever hope to be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#2:1:A>
That then what they conventional wisdom <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#3:1:A>
Until beginning nineteen eighty-seven <,> All India Radio undertook
a series of broadcast <,> in India <,> a new experiment in integrated social
broadcasting <,> of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere
in the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#4:1:A>
These broadcasts have been a spectacular success <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#5:1:A>
The credit for this goes to the vision <,> the dedication <,> the
committment and the leadership <,> of one man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#6:1:A>
His name <,> Amrit Rao Shinde <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#7:1:A>
His job <,> Director General of All India Radio

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#8:1:A>
And right now as you can see he is with us in our studio <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#9:1:A>
Mr Shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of
the morning show <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#10:1:A>
Now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen
eighty-seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#11:1:A>
Then you moved on to method of science to <indig> Jeevan Saurabh
</indig> to radio date and so on

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#12:1:A>
What is the <,> origin of this idea ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#13:1:A>
How did you decide that <,> radio should now play some kind of a
more active role <,> in social broadcasting <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#14:1:B>
After the <,> introduction of colour television in India <,,>
uh in fact we in broadcasting <,,> the professionals were little disturbed
because the listening <,,> has shifted to television <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#15:1:B>
And because one factor was <,> dominating <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#16:1:B>
The programme pattern of radio <,,> was not very attractive <,> to
the listeners <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#17:1:B>
Secondly the television the new media which was <,,> progressing in
this country and expanding <,,> uh with a great speed <,,> was able to
provide a lot of entertainment <,> good entertainment quiet good
entertainment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#18:1:B>
So we were worried that how <,> we can <,,> shift our programme
pattern in such a way <,,> where we can <,> attract the listeners <,> and
keep our uh <,,> uh listening to the optimum <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#19:1:B>
In search of this <,> we have <,> arranged many seminars and
workshop at different places <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#20:1:B>
I have moved from places to places I have discussed uh <,> the
problems with professionals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#21:1:B>
And uh <,> we <}> <-> come </-> <+> came </+> </}> to the
conclusion especially <,> in the light of success of <,> radio <}> <-> form
</-> <=> forum </=> </}> <,> especially programmes for the rural audiences
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#22:1:B>
That if we go in for subjects and programmes <,,> which are
directly concerned to a listener <,,> and where they are in <,> need of some
information <,> or where they are in need of some guidance <,> and where they
are <,,> uh looking for <,> more kind of education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#23:1:B>
I think that area if we adopt <,> and feel what the listeners see
in that programming <,> <w> I'm </w> sure this uh <,> we can <,> achieve the
success desired <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#24:1:B>
And the first experiment we started <,> at A I R Bangalore in
nineteen eighty-seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#25:1:B>
The programme series was known as <indig> Nisarg Sampada </indig>
social forestry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#26:1:B>
And this programme was planned in <,,> collaboration and
cooperation with this uh <,> <O> one word </O> Forest Department of Karnataka
government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#27:1:B>
And we worked out thirteen episodes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#28:1:B>
And uh <,> those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing
with various <,> communicators <,> experts <,> and at <,> taking a tryst in
the field <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#29:1:B>
Total of programmes we took in the field

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#30:1:B>
And uh <,> we assessed <,> the success of the <,,> and impact of
the programme on the listeners <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#31:1:B>
And then we <,,> made some changes in the formats <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#32:1:B>
And we thought we should <,> use two-way communication system <,>
to be more effective <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#33:1:B>
And that is what we adopted

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#34:1:B>
And it proved very successful <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#35:1:B>
This particular programme was subsequently <,> introduced on all
India basis <,> in fifteen languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#36:1:B>
And for that purpose we invited applications <,> from our listeners
to register <,> forest <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#37:1:B>
So response was our <,> plan was to <,> register about one <indig>
lakh </indig> <,> listeners throughout the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#38:1:B>
But the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty
thousand <,> and we felt that it is <,> important for us to <O> one word </O>
we requested the listeners <,> the register has stop <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#39:1:B>
So that was the uh response in the beginning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#40:1:B>
Then after the completion of the series

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#41:1:B>
<.> Duri </.> come <,> series we got number of letters and it was
<,,> unmanageble for us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#42:1:B>
And we conducted open <?> book </?> examination <,,> to just assess
<,> how much our programme has been successful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#43:1:B>
How <,> much information the listener has retained <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#44:1:B>
It is not only that <-> it </-> they listen it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#45:1:B>
But whether <-> have </-> <,> they have <,> acquired this and
retained it <,> that is very important factor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#46:1:B>
And through these open examinations <,,> we observed that more than
seventy-five <}> <-> persons </-> <,,> <=> percent </=> </}> of the <,>
registered listeners appeared for the open book examination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#47:1:B>
And their degree of <.> infor </.> knowledge was about
seventy-three percent correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#48:1:B>
And large number of of <,> <.> exa </.> the <,,> prizes were given
to the first <,> and that was <-> the </-> how we got <,> into the new format
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#49:1:A>
Uhm <,> uh sir did you face any kind of scepticism <O> laughs
</O> when you decided to launch <,> this revolutionary series of broadcast
<,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#50:1:B>
Yes of course because <,,> uh among we professionals <,,>
there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#51:1:B>
And uh <,> there is always a resistence for new ideas new
experiments <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#52:1:B>
And it was there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#53:1:B>
And people thought but who is going to <?> attain </?> and suggest
after all <,> people know about it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#54:1:B>
They are for years together they know about forest

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#55:1:B>
What new things <+> you </+> are going to impart <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#56:1:B>
And it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#57:1:B>
But <,,> I said <quote> Let us try and do it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#58:1:B>
Let us see how we get this one </quote> because unless we try <,,>
we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#59:1:B>
Or whether we should pursue this particular format or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#60:1:B>
And after the efforts were done the series was introduced and
concluded <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#61:1:B>
We found it was the most successful format <w> that's </w> <?> good
</?> to a listeners <,,> beyond our expectations <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#62:1:A>
<indig> Pichhle sal <mention> All India Radio </mention> ne ye
abhiyan kiya jisse <,> jis karyakram ko aap ne </indig> Radio Date <indig> ka
nam diya hai </indig> Date standing for uh <,,> what <w> what's </w> the
actual name for <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#63:1:B>
Uh <,> Radio Date Date <,> drug <,,> alcohol <,> tobacco <,>
education

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#64:1:A>
Right

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#65:1:A>
Now <,> you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio
series of its kind anywhere in the world <,> <{> <[> right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#66:1:A>
Uh what <,> prompted you to go in for this ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#67:1:A>
What have been your <,> experiences ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#68:1:A>
What were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#69:1:A>
And what is your assessment <,> of this experiment <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#70:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#71:1:B>
See uh <,,> as a broadcaster <,> we always lookout for some
area and subjects <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#72:1:B>
And any problem we come across <,,> we always want to see from the
angle of whether we can <,,> use this subject <,> for programming and we can
<,,> use our uh <,> technique of communication <,,> for the wider uh <,,>
information <,> and acceptance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#73:1:B>
Uh it is actually I myself was a chain smoker <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#74:1:B>
For ten years I was smoking fifty cigars per day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#75:1:B>
And nineteen sixty-two I left it <,> once for all for <O> one or
two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#76:1:B>
One day I was coming from uh <,> Malaysia via Singapore

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#77:1:B>
At the airport I saw <,,> a very good looking charming <O> one word
</O> air-hostess was sitting there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#78:1:B>
And within two minutes I found she started smoking and the whole
<,> her uh <,,> uh facial expression that whole thing has changed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#79:1:B>
And that struck me whether <,,> this particular subject we should
take in <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#80:1:B>
Because uh <,,> tobacco as you know <,> there is no control <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#81:1:B>
You can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#82:1:B>
There is no control of smoking <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#83:1:B>
Any person from child five years <,> to ninety years smokes no
control over it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#84:1:B>
No restriction on the place of smoking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#85:1:B>
There is restriction <,> for the drinking <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#86:1:B>
There are dry areas

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#87:1:B>
But for tobacco <,> consumption there is no restriction no law at
all <,> <{> <[> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#88:1:B>
So I thought this is area which is <,> common so commonly <,>
spread over this <}> <-> <.> ha ha </.> </-> <=> habit </=> </}> or what can
say addiction

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#89:1:B>
So radio can play very important role <,> because the reach of
radio <,,> is very much high and interior area especially <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#90:1:B>
And uh <,> among the underprevileged classes <,,> so we thought we
should work out on these bases <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#91:1:B>
But how to work out how to go about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#92:1:B>
So we actually <,,> uh approached <,,> the I C C M R uh <,> to
whether they can help us <,> with this research and uh <,> information
whether we can <,> uh work out

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#93:1:B>
And then in collaboration with this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#94:1:B>
We evolved this series <,> like <mention> Radio Date </mention>
because they adviced that that we should also include <,> drugs <,> and uh
<,,> uhm alchohol also <,> as a part of the whole series

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#95:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> how we started the series <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#96:1:B>
And we involved number of experts who have done lot of research
work <,> in tobbaco areas

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#97:1:B>
And it was found <,,> that <-> the </-> every druggist or alcoholic
person has graduated from smoking <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#98:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#99:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#100:1:B>
He initially <}> <-> smoking </-> <+> smoked </+> </}> and
then he has gone to that level <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#101:1:B>
So <,> everybody was <.> con </.> uh <,> convinced <,> that this
series must be taken very seriously and we should do <,,> uh something <,>
and contribute something substantial <,> for the improvement of this <O> one
word </O> health <,> and over all atmosphere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#102:1:B>
And thats how this we started working on it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#103:1:B>
And then thereafter <,,> we <,> worked out the format <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#104:1:B>
And same methodology adopted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#105:1:B>
First we <,> we conducted a workshop <,> in fifteen languages <,>
we prepared prototypes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#106:1:B>
Took the <O> one word </O> in the field <,> tested them <,> and
came back

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#107:1:B>
And whatever the deficiencies we found out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#108:1:B>
During the testing they were removed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#109:1:B>
And then final programme was <-> gone </-> mass production <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#110:1:B>
And the same technique was adopted

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#111:1:B>
We invited application <,> called the registrations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#112:1:B>
Because we wanted that our listeners should be <,> the same
listener throughout the series

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#113:1:B>
And he should be seriously involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#114:1:B>
And we were happy to know that <,> everybody <-> were listener
</-> who <,> registered himself was communicating with us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#115:1:B>
And the impact was so tremendous <,,> that <-> there </-> number
of people who wrote to us <,> that <w> they've </w> given up smoking <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#116:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#117:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#118:1:B>
Now I C M R is conducting <,,> a post broadcast research <,> at
Bangalore and Calcutta <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#119:1:B>
That those people who wrote to us <,> and they gave up the smoking
or drug addiction <,> thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#120:1:B>
What is happening to them thereafter <,,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#121:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#122:1:B>
So that was the <,> impact of this particular series <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#123:1:A>
As a television person uh <,,> my heart is with television
<O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#124:1:A>
You will appreciate that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#125:1:A>
My mind agrees with what you were saying sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#126:1:A>
But now this experience that <w> you've </w> gained from this
earlier series on methods of science <indig> jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya
aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#127:1:A>
To jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain <,> uske aadhar par ab
aap kya karne lage hain </indig> <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#128:1:B>
<indig> Ab hamne ek naya serial <,,> uh kiya hain </indig>
human evolution <indig> manushya ka vikas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#129:1:B>
Ye </indig> serial <,> <indig> ek kaafi lamba </indig> serial
<indig> hoga abhi tak mere khayalse kisi <,> dunya mei aise vishay par itna
lamba </indig> serial <,> <indig> banaya nahin gaya <,> aur manushka <,>
vikas ka jo hissa hain </indig> <,> we were <O> one word </O> much of the <O>
one word </O> <,> <indig> isme bhi hamane <,> bahutse </indig> institution
<indig> ko liya hai </indig> Tata Fundamental Research <indig> bhi isme
</indig> involve <indig> hain <,> aur uh </indig> <,> this National Council
of Science and Technology also been involved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#130:1:B>
Some eminent scientists are involved <,> Dr S R Rao <,> and some
persons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#131:1:B>
And we have worked out the <O> one word </O> now doing last one
and half year we were working on this project <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#132:1:B>
<indig> Aur ab ye saara </indig> <,> complete <indig> ho chuka
hain <,> do </indig> June <indig> se hum ye shure kar rahe hain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#133:1:B>
Aur is </indig> serial ka bhi </indig> technique <indig> wohi hain
<,> ke </indig> registration of the listeners <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#134:1:B>
<indig> Aur uske baad </indig> listener <indig> se </indig>
communication <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#135:1:B>
Two-way communication technique <indig> wohi tarika hoga <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#136:1:B>
Aur uske baad </indig> in between we are going to have <,,> survey
conducted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#137:1:B>
To see the impact <,> of the series <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#138:1:B>
The whole object appears our object is to <,,> generate a
scientific temper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#139:1:B>
<indig> Ki log har cheej ko <,> vaigyanik drishti se dekhe <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#140:1:B>
Ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#141:1:B>
Kaise hota hain ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#142:1:B>
Manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#143:1:B>
Uska </indig> behaviour <indig> mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya
</indig> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#144:1:B>
Why that <O> one word </O> changing <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#145:1:B>
And <,,> we have come from where <,> to this stage ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#146:1:B>
And what is next <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#147:1:B>
Where are you going ahead <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#148:1:B>
So this kind of the different of facets <,> of the human evolution
<,> are going to be discussed in this series <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#149:1:A>
Within a particular series like this one on human <,> uh
evolution <,> the sub-subject how do you decide then <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#150:1:B>
That subject we discussed with various <,> uh experts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#151:1:B>
And also we conducted surveys

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#152:1:B>
And we try <-> we </-> to assess <,> <indig> ke </indig> which are
the areas where the information is required more <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#153:1:B>
And where are the areas where the information is very less
available <,> or the common listener has no access for that information <,,>
at his level in the villages or interior areas <,> or in uh rural areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#154:1:B>
So that kind of information we want to see

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#155:1:B>
It is vital information <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#156:1:B>
And without that information the further information which we are
going to give to them <,> will not be <,> relevant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#157:1:B>
So so that we have to link up <,> those areas <,> and see that
there is no gap of information <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#158:1:B>
As well as information which is needed <,> to the listeners <,> is
given <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#159:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#160:1:A>
Let me be the <w> devil's </w> advocate for a moment <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#161:1:A>
<.> Ye ye </.> your experience obviously has <,> demonstrated
beyond the shadow of doubt that radio <,> is still a very effective medium
for social education and social change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#162:1:A>
Then what about uh family welfare family planning <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#163:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#164:1:B>
That is another aspect <w> I'm </w> telling you

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#165:1:B>
Because <,> family planning I think we are <,> putting out more
than six thousand programmes every month <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#166:1:B>
And there also the success is so great <,,> that the <,,> latest
surveys all the surveys which have been conducted <,> for different places
<,> have been uh <,> uhn <,> shown that the <,> first source of information
on family welfare <,> was radio <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#167:1:A>
Uhm <,> all right

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#168:1:A>
Now on the table in front of us <,> Mr Director General there are
<,> these little kits lying

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#169:1:A>
Would you like to tell us what they are <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#170:1:B>
So this was the kits which were <O> one or two words </O>
method of science <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#171:1:B>
So these kits were <,> where you find the <O> one word </O> is
there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#172:1:A>
Let me

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#173:1:B>
It is on do <}> <-> you </-> <+> it </+> </}> yourselves

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#174:1:B>
I can just show you <,> this

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#175:1:B>
This <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#176:1:B>
Now these are the lenses which were supplied <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#177:1:B>
Because <-> there was some </-> certain <,,> uh lessons were there

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#178:1:B>
And certain experiments were shown <,> to the listener

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#179:1:B>
The kits were <}> <-> provide </-> <+> provided </+> </}> to one
lakh forty thousand <,,> uh people all the registered <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#180:1:B>
And this is the stone <,> covering that particular experiment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#181:1:B>
So that <,> the listener can himself <,,> try this experiment at
home <,,> how the things work <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#182:1:A>
Ah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#183:1:A>
And we also provided a chart <,> a big huge chart was shown
to them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#184:1:A>
This type

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#185:1:A>
Which one is it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#186:1:A>
Is it the chart ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#187:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#188:1:B>
This is it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#189:1:B>
You can see this is a chart of uh <?> mega </?> of science <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#190:1:B>
See here

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#191:1:A>
Here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#192:1:B>
So every thing was available in advance <,> with the
listeners

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#193:1:A>
I see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#194:1:B>
And that before the days programme was started they had to
read this particular portion <,> and also the questions were raised

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#195:1:B>
What kind of uh <,,> uh questions they can raise it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#196:1:B>
And when they listen the programme and then write to us and
experiment with this kit <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#197:1:A>
Uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#198:1:B>
Yes yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#199:1:A>
Uh <,> sir <indig> ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki
antarashtriya </indig> radio <indig> sansthaye hain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#200:1:A>
Jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un
hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki </indig> <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#201:1:B>
<indig> Ye <,> iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino
</indig> <,> Asia Basic Broadcasting Organisation <indig> ki </indig> meeting
<indig> hui thi </indig> <,> Singapore <indig> mein <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#202:1:B>
Wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi <,> aur khaas taur se jo
vikas sheel desh hain <,> jo uske sadsya hain <,> unhone hamse iske baareme
kafi </indig> material <indig> manga hain <,> aur usse uh doosara </indig>
experiment <indig> jo hamne pahle kiya tha uske liye hamare paas bhi </indig>
<,> Ghana <indig> se log aaye the yaha dekh neke liye <,> ki hum kis tarahse
<O> one word </O> kar rahe hain kaise ja rahe hain <,> aur </indig> communal
broadcasting uh <,> association <indig> ki jo </indig> meeting <indig> hui
thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#203:1:B>
Aur woh log hairat me hain ke </indig> radio can do so much <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#204:1:B>
And uh how it is possible without the visual aids <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#205:1:B>
Merely if <w> it's </w> a stromg medium we are able to go ahead
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#206:1:A>
Well the Director General gave us a peep into the future

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#207:1:A>
What comes after the serial on human evolution <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#208:1:B>
See <,,> uh we are thinking on some social uh <,> areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#209:1:B>
And we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas
where <,> because without the input from the <,> research we do not <+> want
</+> to <,> <}> <-> going </-> <+> go </+> </}> ahead <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#210:1:B>
Because we want to be very sure <indig> ke </indig> this
particular area needs <,> the radio has to play a role <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#211:1:B>
And then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#212:1:B>
But our aim will be <,> only to take up the social issues <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-049#213:1:A>
Well sir thank you <,> very much for having been with us on
the <,> morning show

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#216:1:A>

but we will be watching <,> nevertheless

<ICE-IND:S1B-049#217:1:A>
