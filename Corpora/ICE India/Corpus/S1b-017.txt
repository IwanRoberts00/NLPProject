<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#1:1:A>
Well <,> we will be discussing today <,,> the lesson <,,> that
I <,> have already started

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#2:1:A>
Do you know <,> the lesson that I am going to discuss <}> <-> <.> to
</.> </-> <=> today </=> </}>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#3:1:C>
Malefactor Malefactor

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#4:1:A>
Malefactor <,> <w> that's </w> right <,,> <w> that's </w> right
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#5:1:A>
And I do hope that <,> by now all of you might have read the lesson
<,,> and understood the contents of it too <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#6:1:A>
Right <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#7:1:A>
The first question that we are going to raise today for discussion
<,> is that do you justify the title <,> of the story <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#8:1:A>
Do you justify the title of the story <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#9:1:A>
I mean you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#10:1:A>
Would you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#11:1:A>
<w> What's </w> your opinion <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#12:1:S>
Sir the chapter raise the <,> sir <,> Denis is not <,> not <}>
<-> actually </-> <=> actually </=> </}> a criminal <,> criminal but uh like
<,,> <}> <-> he uh does the </-> <=> he does uh </=> </}> <,,> he opens the
screw unknowingly

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#13:1:S>
Right he doesn't know that it is really a crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#14:1:S>
Actually he does it unknowingly <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#15:1:A>
So what you mean that he is not a criminal <-> one </-> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#16:1:S>
No he isn't

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#17:1:A>
Right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#18:1:A>
Yes please what do you have to say <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#19:1:S>
That the title Malefactor <}> <-> doesn'tjustify the <,,> uh
<,> </-> <=> doesn't justify </=> </}> on <,> Denis because he is not a
criminal and he doesn't uh <,,> commit the act knowingly

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#20:1:S>
He just <,,> uh does it unknowingly and <,> tells the judge also
that he had done <,,> and doesn't hide anything like a <,> a professional
criminal

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#21:1:A>
Okay if we turn the pages of our <,> text we will find that he
knows <,,> he does know <,> that unscrewing of the nuts may lead to the rail
accident <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#22:1:A>
If you see the line <,> you will find he confesses <,> that <quote>
we know that it may lead to the train accident <w> that's </w> why we don't
unscrew all the nuts <,,> we unscrew only few </quote> <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#23:1:S>
Sir he doesn't <,> say that we know that accident will occur
as a result so he says that we know that <,> the nut holds the railway track

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#24:1:A>
Right

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#25:1:S>
Sir he says that nuts cannot cause an accident

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#26:1:A>
No not that one

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#27:1:A>
But he does <,> he does know <,,> that if we unscrew all the nuts
<,> it may lead to <,> train accident <,> causing the loss of life and
property <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#28:1:A>
He does know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#29:1:A>
What are the other clues by that you can justify the title <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#30:1:A>
You can't say that here <,> whether he is a criminal <,> or <,> not
<,,> <&> noise </&>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#31:1:S>
Sir first thing he said that he was <+> a </+> very poor man
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#32:1:A>
Yes

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#33:1:S>
It was when that he said <,> you can't find lead or nail <,>
uh uh on the street <,> or you have to buy that <,> <{> <[> ah <,> so he was
<+> a </+> very poor man

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#34:1:S>
So <,> he drills hole into <,> pluck out nut from the track

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#35:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#36:1:A>
Right <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#37:1:A>
Perhaps you would <,> mean to say that while judging him as a
criminal we must <,,> see his <,> situation too <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#38:1:A>
The circumstances <,> he is pressed by <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#39:1:A>
We find that he is such a poor man <,,> that he is not in a
position to buy the <,,> other thing <,> to use as sinker <,> as he is
pleading again and again that <,> I do it I <,,> did unscrew the nuts only to
<,> use them as sinkers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#40:1:A>
Perhaps his financial condition is not so that he may buy the <,>
other thing <,> or substitute of the nut <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#41:1:A>
Isn't so <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#42:1:A>
Anything else that you have to say <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#43:1:A>
Yes <,,> ? <&> noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#44:1:A>
Anything <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#45:1:A>
You wanted to tell something <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#46:1:A>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#47:1:A>
Then <,,> what else you have to say <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#48:1:A>
Is there any other clue <,,> whereby you can prove that he is not a
criminal <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#49:1:A>
The one thing that you have clarified is that <,,> it is the <,,>
demand of the circumstances or he is pressed by the circumstances <w> that's
</w> why he unscrewed <,,> the nuts

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#50:1:A>
Anything else <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#51:1:S>
The criminal was not an educated <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#52:1:A>
He is not an educated one

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#53:1:S>
Educated man and even he doesn't know <,,> anything about the
<,> track anything that it can cause accident by plucking out of the lines

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#54:1:A>
Right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#55:1:A>
May be accepted <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#56:1:S>
Sir lot of whole society <,> are unscrewing the nut but <,>
but an individual cannot be termed <,> say that he has <,> unscrewed the nut
<,> <{> <[> so <,> rules of the society is also there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#57:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#58:1:A>
Right <,> whole society means the gentry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#59:1:A>
There <+> is </+> not only <-> the </-> Denis alone <,> <}> <->
when </-> <+> but </+> </}> other people of the community are also doing the
same thing <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#60:1:S>
Sir he doesn't hide the name of anyone <,> but he tells two or
three names more to the judge

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#61:1:A>
Right

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#62:1:S>
This shows that he was not a criminal <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#63:1:A>
But one thing is there <,,> suppose if the majority of the
people are doing the same thing <-> you </-> <,> how can you say that <w>
it's </w> not a crime <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#64:1:A>
Can you <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#65:1:A>
If <,> majority of the people do the same work <,,> does it means
uh <,> file any logic or thereby can you say that yes <,> it is not a crime
because the large number of people are doing so <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#66:1:A>
So how can we accept this one that because not only Denis but other
fellows are also doing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#67:1:A>
Other members of the community are also doing <w> that's </w> why
<w> it's </w> not a very <,> serious crime <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#68:1:S>
It is a <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#69:1:S>
Sir it is a crime <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#70:1:A>
It is a ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#71:1:S>
Crime <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#72:1:A>
If it is a crime then you might be justifying the punishment
too <,,> given to him

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#73:1:S>
Yes sir <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#74:1:S>
Denis does qualify as a criminal with one more reason because
<,> the law says that if the <,> committer does the crime knowingly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#75:1:A>
And so he did it do it knowingly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#76:1:A>
Right

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#77:1:S>
It was stated in the law <,> panel code one zero eight <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#78:1:A>
Means the gravity of the punishment should also <,> take care
of whether something is done knowingly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#79:1:A>
What is the intention of the <,,> person doing a particular offence
<,,> committing a crime <,> intention of the mind should also be <,,> uh
taken care of <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#80:1:A>
So <,,> was there any intention like that one <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#81:1:S>
No <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#82:1:A>
Was there any bad intention ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#83:1:C>
No sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#84:1:A>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#85:1:A>
So <,> we can say if there was no any bad intention like <,,> rail
accident <,,> or <,> other things like <,> then he must not be given that
much severe punishment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#86:1:A>
He should not be levelled as a criminal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#87:1:A>
Why <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#88:1:A>
Because he did it without knowing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#89:1:A>
So if we sum up the things we can say <,,> first of all <,> that it
is the <,> circumstances <,> it is his financial condition <,> that made him
to <}> <-> do </-> <,> <=> commit </=> </}> the crime <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#90:1:A>
Second thing is that <,> his intention is not bad

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#91:1:A>
He is doing it unknowingly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#92:1:A>
There is no any bad intention of <,,> causing the rail accident
<,,> causing the loss of life and property <,> no intention

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#93:1:A>
Anything else <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#94:1:A>
On the ground of that you can say that he doesn't deserve that much
severe punishment <,,> <&> Noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#95:1:A>
Is there any more points <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#96:1:A>
Can you recollect <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#97:1:A>
Yes <,,> can you recollect <,,> ? <&> noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#98:1:A>
Can you <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#99:1:S>
No <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#100:1:A>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#101:1:A>
Anybody else <,> in the class <,,> who has any more points <,,>
thereby who can say that the title <,,> of the story <,,> Malefactor is not
appropriate one <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#102:1:A>
Yes ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#103:1:S>
The society around him <,> made the circumstances <-> that
they made him </-> to do that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#104:1:S>
But the role <-> and role and </-> of the society <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#105:1:A>
That is the <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#106:1:S>
The whole world of the <,> crime <-> world the they </->
depend on society <,> around us <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#107:1:A>
How the society is responsible <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#108:1:S>
Because he says that <,> they <+> the </+> wise men and the
uh <,> men of the village <,> do the same work <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#109:1:A>
Right <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#110:1:S>
It means that from the childhood he is <,> made to do the
same thing <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#111:1:A>
Now that we have already taken <,> that is more number of the
people do the same thing that is <,,> an offence

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#112:1:A>
We cannot say that it is not an offence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#113:1:A>
Sit down please sit down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#114:1:A>
Yes anything else <,,> ? <&> noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#115:1:A>
So <,,> in your view the title of the story is not appropriate one
<,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#116:1:S>
No sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#117:1:A>
Can you think of <,> can you substitute any other appropriate
title to the story ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#118:1:A>
If this one is not appropriate <,> can we <,,> give any
appropriate title to the story <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#119:1:A>
Can you think of any new title to the story <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#120:1:S>
Sir poverty is great crime <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#121:1:S>
Poverty create crime <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#122:1:A>
Poverty <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#123:1:S>
Create crime <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#124:1:A>
Poverty creates crime and <,,> why only poverty ignorance is
also with that <,,> or both are coincided very often <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#125:1:S>
Sir <,,> sir innocent criminal <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#126:1:A>
Innocent criminal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#127:1:A>
Then the title suggested is <,> suggested one is <,,> Innocent
Criminal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#128:1:A>
What is your <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> reaction </=> </}> to it ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#129:1:S>
Sir <}> <-> criminal </-> <=> criminal </=> </}> cannot be
called innocent no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#130:1:S>
The criminal cannot be <}> <-> called </-> <=> called </=> </}>
innocent <,> <{> <[> then <,> he is a criminal sir but sir he is a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#131:1:A>
<[> Then </[> </{>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#132:1:S>
Sir but sir he is innocent <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#133:1:S>
Sir he is little bit innocent <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#134:1:A>
Yes sit down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#135:1:A>
Okay <,,> that a criminal cannot be <,> but you know that <,> one
of the merit of the title is to create interest in the story too <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#136:1:A>
If it is an innocent criminal <,,> then perhaps you will be
interested to learn <,,> that how an innocent man became a criminal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#137:1:A>
It may create some interest too <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#138:1:A>
Can you think of similar title <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#139:1:A>
On the same line can you <,,> find any better one <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#140:1:A>
Okay if not <,> according to you what type of punishment does he
deserve <,,> ? <&> noises </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#141:1:A>
In case <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#142:1:S>
<O> A few words </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#143:1:A>
In case he is not a criminal one <,> but he has done
something wrong you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#144:1:A>
Knowingly <,,> unknowingly <,,> whatever is there but he has done
something wrong and he has been caught <,,> red handed too <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#145:1:A>
What type of punishment <,,> would you like to accord to him <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#146:1:A>
Yes <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#147:1:S>
He has to reveal the plan <,> causing the liability that <,>
that they are but not the individual particular in society <,> to be taught
as <,> has given me a <O> one word </O> <,> to seek a as if <,> they had
deliberately done <,> <{> <[> then <,> <O> a few words </O> <&> noise </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#148:1:A>
<[> Then </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#149:1:A>
Then one thing perhaps you want to say <,> that we will take
this one as a feedback <,> and educate the society

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#150:1:A>
Tell the people <,> that this is something very wrong <,> they
must not do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#151:1:A>
He must be <,> instructed like that one and should be released or
any other punishment <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#152:1:S>
He should be <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#153:1:A>
Yes please <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#154:1:S>
He should be let off with a warning or at the most he should
be imprison for one or two months <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#155:1:A>
He should be given <,,> either the warning or <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#156:1:S>
Imprisonment at the most for one or two months <,> not too
much <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#157:1:A>
Right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#158:1:A>
Not more than one or two months <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#159:1:A>
Anything else <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#160:1:A>
Vishal <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#161:1:A>
You know the <,,> what is the <,,> target what is the aim of the
punishment <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#162:1:A>
Just to bring improvement <,> and check the further crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#163:1:A>
Just to bring the improvement as well as <,,> to check the further
crime too <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#164:1:A>
So <,> one is that he should be <,> given either a very light
punishment <,,> one or two months <,,> imprisonment <,,> with some warning
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#165:1:A>
Another one <,,> is suggesting that the fellow should be left <,>
and government or the agency should take it as a feedback <,,> and <,> tell
or educate the other people regarding the <,,> offence <,,> that they should
not do it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#166:1:A>
Right <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#167:1:A>
They should be told they should be <,,> uh educated <,,> that it
is something wrong <,,> very wrong it may lead to severe punishment and they
should not do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#168:1:A>
Right <,,> mass awakening

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#169:1:A>
Anything else <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#170:1:A>
Anything else <,,> in the capacity of a magistrate that you would
like to <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#171:1:S>
Sir <,,> the presence of that many people in the village as
petty according to famous man also do uh <,> make that uh net so he wants
more nut in that

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#172:1:S>
So <,> <w> it's </w> mass awareness is needed to educate all the
village and warn them <,> that they had to do no more plucking of the nut
from track site

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#173:1:A>
Right <,,> right <,,> I do agree <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#174:1:A>
I do agree with you <,,> that such an ingnorant man <,,> such a
<,,> simple honest man <,,> should not be given a very severe punishment

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#175:1:A>
Atleast one or two chances must be given to him to improve himself
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#176:1:A>
And <,,> the other members of the community should also be <,,>
shown <,> that this is something punishable <,> and they must leave it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#177:1:A>
I think that such honest fellows if given the chance they will
improve <,,> they will leave such crimes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#178:1:A>
They will realise the <,,> gravity of the crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#179:1:A>
Understood <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#180:1:A>
You know <,,> till the very end <,,> Denis doesn't understand that
what for he is being sent to prison <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#181:1:A>
Till the very end he doesn't understand that what for he is being
sent to the prison <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#182:1:A>
Right <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#183:1:A>
Why <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#184:1:A>
He is punished <,,> he is uh <,> given a very severe punishment
<,,> but till the very end he doesn't know that what is his crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#185:1:A>
He doesn't know <,,> he couldn't understand it

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#186:1:A>
Why <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#187:1:A>
Or <,> if I repeat the question like that one <,> what are the
crimes in his eyes <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#188:1:A>
According to him <,> what are the crimes <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#189:1:S>
He thinks that <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#190:1:A>
He thinks that unscrewing a <,,> nut from the rail track is
not a crime at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#191:1:A>
Then what are the crimes in his eyes ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#192:1:A>
Yes <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#193:1:S>
That his brother was not paying the tax <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#194:1:A>
He thinks <,> that <,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#195:1:S>
His brother was not paying the tax

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#196:1:A>
And he is being sent to for his <w> brother's </w> <,> crime
<,> right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#197:1:A>
He thinks that those who fight they must be punished and he hasn't
<,> fought with anyone <w> that's </w> why he doesn't deserve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#198:1:A>
Right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#199:1:A>
Yes <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#200:1:S>
Denis uh says stealing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#201:1:A>
Stealing is punishable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#202:1:A>
So <,> don't you think that he has stolen a nut <,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#203:1:C>
<&> Noise </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#204:1:A>
Don't you think <,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#205:1:C>
<&> Noise </&>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#206:1:S>
He has done unknowingly <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#207:1:A>
He did it unknowingly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#208:1:A>
Right <,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#209:1:S>
He is not stealing the tax <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#210:1:A>
He

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#211:1:S>
Not stealing tax

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#212:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig> one who doesn't pay the taxes <,,> he
deserves the punishment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#213:1:A>
Right <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#214:1:S>
Sir coming for judgement

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#215:1:A>
What <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#216:1:S>
Sir there is one thing that he never <O> a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#217:1:A>
Please sit down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#218:1:A>
Yes <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#219:1:A>
So I think <,,> stealing non-payment of the taxes <,> and he
thinks that <,,> he has not stolen anything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#220:1:A>
He has not fought with anyone <,,> and <,,> he has paid his taxes
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#221:1:A>
So he doesn't deserve the <,> <{> <[> punishment <,> punishment

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#222:1:A>
Understood <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#223:1:A>
<w> That's </w> why till the very end he couldn't convince himself
<,> that he is a criminal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#224:1:A>
Though he was found criminal in the eyes of the law <,> but he
couldn't convince himself that he is a criminal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#225:1:A>
Okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#226:1:A>
So is there any confusion <,,> regarding the story <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#227:1:S>
<[> Punishment </[> </{>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#228:1:S>
No sir <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-017#229:1:A>
Or is there any other questions that <w> you've </w> got in
your mind <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-017#230:1:A>
Anyone <,,> any sort of the questions or doubts <,,> ? </I>
