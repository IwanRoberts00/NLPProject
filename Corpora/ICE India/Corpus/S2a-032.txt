<ICE-IND:S2A-032#1:1:A>
Hello <,> uh recap <,,> we said that <,,> there are atleast  
<,,> two schools of thought <,> when it comes to the scope of economics <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#2:1:A>
One is distribution <,> one emphasises allocation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#3:1:A>
Depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also  
differs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#4:1:A>
For example <,> when you have distribution as your aim <,> then your  
thinking apparatus will be in this way <,> where surplus is distributed  
between workers and entrepreneurs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#5:1:A>
Whereas when you have allocation as allocation as your aim then your  
tools of analysis are calculus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#6:1:A>
One another distinction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#7:1:A>
When it comes to <,> the question of allocation <,,> substitution  
between the two things becomes the central issue <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#8:1:A>
Alfred Marshall <,> in his principles of economics <,> if you see  
<,> the eighth edition which was the last one that is there <,> if he had  
lived upto now he would have made further editions of the same thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#9:1:A>
It is a very nice book 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#10:1:A>
People don't read these days that book <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#11:1:A>
It is very good <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#12:1:A>
For the sheer English language atleast it is worth reading <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#13:1:A>
Apart from very perceptive ideas <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#14:1:A>
Marshall was a man of tremendous perception <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#15:1:A>
Joan Robinson once said that he has a <w> woman's </w> perception  
like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men <,> <O>  
laughs </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#16:1:A>
Uh so <,> that that <w> that's </w> the way she described him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#17:1:A>
Well <,> if you see in the preface <,,> Alfred Marshall says <,>  
that the chief merit of this book is the application of the principle of  
substitution in every branch of economics <,> because if you don't have that  
substitution <,> you can't have the maximisation thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#18:1:A>
It is an essential part of it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#19:1:A>
For example if I have a curve like this <,> I can't take a tangent  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#20:1:A>
It requires that I have a <,> a relationship which has a curvature  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#21:1:A>
Here here for example it is diminishing <,> this but it is  
diminishing at a constant rate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#22:1:A>
Whatever I give up in pie <,> I get in W U and vice versa <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#23:1:A>
Whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing  
marginal rate of substitution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#24:1:A>
This is at the heart of micro economics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#25:1:A>
Take away this assumption <,,> micro tools are not there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#26:1:A>
But at this point one another <,> thing which is normally not refer  
to in text books let me <,> present to you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#27:1:A>
This assumption of diminishing marginal rate of substitution <,>  
you know it is an assumption <,> independent of mathematics <,,> independent  
of mathematics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#28:1:A>
For example <,,> take the most important micro foundation that  
first chapter the students learn <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#29:1:A>
That is about utility theory <,,> utility maximisation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#30:1:A>
And when the students come to the classroom we tell them that uh  
<,> that if there are two commodities <,> and if I <,,> let us say Q one <,>  
and Q two are the two commodities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#31:1:A>
And I tell the students <,,> you know that <,> utility is a  
function of the consumption of these two <,> commodities <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#32:1:A>
Right <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#33:1:A>
And I make an assumption that the more he consume the more he is  
satisfied <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#34:1:A>
More is preferred than less <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#35:1:A>
And we make an assumption that preferences are <,,> transitive <,>  
though you know that it is if A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C than  
A is bigger than C and not the other way round 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#36:1:A>
This kind of axioms of choice <,> we teach them <,> because on that  
basis <,> this is the micro foundage you know micro economic is grounded in  
individual behaviour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#37:1:A>
And those individual behaviour we give in the form of axioms of  
choice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#38:1:A>
Right <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#39:1:A>
And on the basis of that we try to derive what is known as an  
indifference curve or a utility function <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#40:1:A>
First we say <,> <quote> Utility is a function of Q one and Q two  
</quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#41:1:A>
And in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a  
picture like this <,,> <&> B B writing </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#42:1:A>
They won't explain how come this equation this picture came <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#43:1:A>
That is why students find it very difficult to understand <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#44:1:A>
And you know sometimes teachers also find it difficult 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#45:1:A>
And sometimes you know what happens is the students don't ask  
questions luckily <,,> otherwise it will be very <,> <O> laughter </O> very  
embarassing for the teacher <,> because from this to this you try your best  
<,,> it is near impossible to get that equation 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#46:1:A>
I will tell you why <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#47:1:A>
That is what we have to learn in refresher programmes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#48:1:A>
Something on the foundation <,,> because what happens is you know  
for twenty years some book comes we teach to our students on the twenty-first  
year they say <quote> We have changed this book because this is a wrong book  
like that </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#49:1:A>
We also start saying the same thing <,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#50:1:A>
You know in the beginning we didn't ask the question why are we  
reading this book and teaching to our students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#51:1:A>
But before that we try to translate it because we want to have it  
everything in <,> this one 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#52:1:A>
And in second <.> bo </.> you know it is happening like that as if  
knowledge comes <-> for </-> <,> from there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#53:1:A>
It is true knowledge comes from everywhere <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#54:1:A>
But it can also start from here too <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#55:1:A>
And there can be an exchange <,> that is possible if we look at  
these things critically <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#56:1:A>
And therefore if we find that there is some problem <-> herer </->  
error here <w> I'm </w> not suggesting throw this away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#57:1:A>
No no far from it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#58:1:A>
But <,> remembering that such a kind of a thing is there <,> it is  
not something very perfect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#59:1:A>
It is imperfect 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#60:1:A>
But all knowledge is like that <,> whether it is physics <-> or  
even mathematics </-> <,,> or even mathematics <,> uhm 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#61:1:A>
I will not go <,> drag you into that controversy which is a very  
interesting one 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#62:1:A>
Let me come back to this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#63:1:A>
I am talking of micro theory now <,> foundations of micro theory  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#64:1:A>
And in that <,> micro theory takes allocation as the scope of  
economics 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#65:1:A>
It takes calculus as the tool for analysis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#66:1:A>
It assumes about individuals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#67:1:A>
The major assumption it makes is people are selfish <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#68:1:A>
They don't say <quote> It like this </quote> they say <quote> They  
are rational </quote> <,> <O> laughs </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#69:1:A>
Because if I say <quote> People are selfish </quote> it looks very  
bad <,> look he is blaming <,> uh being sales kind of people there we write  
<,> uh people are rational 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#70:1:A>
And rational means that I can order my preferences and choose the  
best <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#71:1:A>
That capability I have like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#72:1:A>
It presumes numeracy <,,> and order <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#73:1:A>
That kind of a capability must be there then only I can <,,> okay  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#74:1:A>
It assumes like that <,> and it it has certain a sect of axioms  
about preferences <,> and then we say that utility is a function of  
consumption <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#75:1:A>
And then we say <quote> Let U bar be the level of utility <,,>  
because unless you have this U bar fixed you don't know where is the first  
point to this graph <,> so you take the first point like that <,> and then  
draw this curve </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#76:1:A>
But there is a problem <,,> because suppose <,> U bar is equal to  
hundred <,,> <&> B B writing </&> right <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#77:1:A>
Then I get some utility by <}> <-> <.> consum </.> </-> <=>  
consuming </=> </}> Q one <,> <w> let's </w> call it Alpha times Q one <,> so  
much Alpha amount of <,> satisfaction I get by Q one <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#78:1:A>
And then that is the <,> Beta amount of satisfaction I get by  
consuming Q two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#79:1:A>
If this total is hundred <,> then if this fifty that must be fifty  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#80:1:A>
If this is seventy-five that must be twenty-five <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#81:1:A>
If this is forty-five that must be <,,> know like the it it can't  
be <,,> more or less and this hundred can be retained <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#82:1:A>
And if you retain that <.> hun </.> don't have that hundred you  
can't draw the curve <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#83:1:A>
If you have that hundred <,> then we find you can try it out any  
number of times <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#84:1:A>
Then we find that it will be a line like this and not a curvature  
like this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#85:1:A>
But if you don't have a curvature I can't have a tangent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#86:1:A>
If I don't have a tangent <,> I don't have a maxima <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#87:1:A>
Therefore I need a tangent 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#88:1:A>
And if I have to draw this tangent I need to make an assumption <,>  
and economist at the micro level have assumed diminishing marginal rate of  
substitution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#89:1:A>
It is a contradictory assumption to the givens <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#90:1:A>
Naturally <,> the right assumption when you say <quote> U bar is  
equal to this <,> and draw the curve it has to be this way </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#91:1:A>
But we are drawing it this way <,> for mathematical convenience  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#92:1:A>
If you take any journal any magazine and start let U be a function  
of something twice differentiable 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#93:1:A>
We make an assumption <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#94:1:A>
Differentiable means drawing of tangent that is finding derivitives  
we say in mathematics <,> but drawing a <}> <-> <.> capa </.> </-> <=>  
capacity </=> </}> to draw a tangent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#95:1:A>
It is <,> tangent is drawable <,> such a curve is assumed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#96:1:A>
If it was natural there was no need for an assumption <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#97:1:A>
We are making an assumption because <,,> <-> this is </-> <,> there  
is a contradict 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#98:1:A>
Has anybody followed this ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#99:1:A>
You can ask me questions about all these things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#100:1:A>
Even in between the lecture also you can stop me and ask 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#101:1:A>
I will explain any number of times <,> because this is not there  
in books <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#102:1:A>
Because striking this out is striking the root of neo-classical  
economics <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#103:1:A>
Because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#104:1:A>
Same principle is true <,> an isoquant is supposed to give iso  
means equal quant means quantity <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#105:1:A>
Isoquant means equal quantity 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#106:1:A>
If equal quantity is to be there <,> then substitution should have  
been a straight line <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#107:1:A>
Because what is happening is <,> here the X axis <,> the Y axis  
<,> and here is the third axis <,,> this is the utility axis actually <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#108:1:A>
And this length is fixed <,> <w> that's </w> why U bar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#109:1:A>
And what we have here is a projection of this third axis <,>  
because it <w> it's </w> a three dimensional picture <,> drawn in a flat way  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#110:1:A>
It <,> it happens to all the artist <,,> when they are painting  
<w> it's </w> usually three dimensional <,> but it is written on a flat  
surface <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#111:1:A>
But your perception <,> your understanding is like that 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#112:1:A>
So here is a third axis <,> not seen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#113:1:A>
<w> It's </w> projection <,> and as long as this is fixed and  
straight it this can't be <}> <-> <.> ano </.> </-> <=> anything </=> </}>  
other than a straight line <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#114:1:A>
If this is it because scale has to be straight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#115:1:A>
Therefore and it is fixed <,,> and it will be a line like this and  
marginal productivity become in fact that is why many people criticise  
marginal productivity theory <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#116:1:A>
On several grounds they <}> <-> <.> criti </.> </-> <=> criticised  
</=> </}> that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#117:1:A>
The classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal  
productivity theory as you know <,> because for them the wage fund is given  
<,,> and then the activity of production takes place <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#118:1:A>
Whereas for the neo-classical <}> <-> <.> ec </.> </-> <=>  
economist </=> </}> the production activity takes place with using those  
inputs <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#119:1:A>
And then those inputs are used again on the basis of supply and  
demand thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#120:1:A>
And brings rational producers and consumers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#121:1:A>
They will supply and demand in such a manner that the price they  
offer <,> <}> <-> <.> ge </.> </-> <=> gets </=> </}> them some return <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#122:1:A>
And that return is <,> as much as what they contribute to output  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#123:1:A>
<w> That's </w> how the marginal productivity theory comes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#124:1:A>
With all its difficulty it has a grain of justice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#125:1:A>
In the sense that <,> give him what he has contributed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#126:1:A>
<w> It's </w> quite a nice concept <,> that is why if you give  
each person what he has contributed than zero profit condition comes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#127:1:A>
<w> That's </w> how the <O> one word </O> theorem comes into  
picture <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#128:1:A>
You see how this is micro economic foundation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#129:1:A>
Are you understanding me ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#130:1:A>
Because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a  
thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#131:1:A>
One another question <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#132:1:A>
In actual life when you make a choice <,,> the choice is never  
like this <,> because this assumes <,,> that always you buy a combination and  
not any one of them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#133:1:A>
Otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#134:1:A>
The indifference curve always start from head here <,> not here  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#135:1:A>
There is a need that I must have all the time a combination <,>  
that may not be so in actual life <,> except when women are buying their  
<indig> sarees </indig> and they want a matching blouse piece <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#136:1:A>
Then only a combination question comes <,> otherwise <,> and  
moreover a <indig> saree </indig> and a blouse piece are not substitutes <,>  
<O> laughs </O> they are compliment <,> they are compliment and not  
substitutes and therefore you can't have law of substitution there 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#137:1:A>
Yeah <,> so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a  
shop <,> you ask the various prices and things like that 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#138:1:A>
You see the colour this that etcetera and so on <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#139:1:A>
And you know how much you have the money and <,> and therefore <,>  
then you can order them and take according to you the best <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#140:1:A>
So it will be a line like this <,> rather than a curve like this  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#141:1:A>
So but here we have got a choice model <,,> which is uh as if  
thing 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#142:1:A>
It is a world of its own <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#143:1:A>
We have created a world of choice making <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#144:1:A>
And then we are making assumptions about substitution <,> and on  
the basis of that we are deciding the best using the tools of calculus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#145:1:A>
This is so in the economics of consumption <,> economics of  
production of international trade any area you go <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#146:1:A>
That is why <,> Professor Samuel San when he wrote his book <,>  
<mention> Foundations of Economic Analysis </mention> <,> if you see that  
book <,,> <w> you'll </w> find from page one to the last page <,> it is  
nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#147:1:A>
The same tool <,> the same kind of graph but they are interpreted  
<,> if instead of Q one and Q two I make it K and L it becomes an isoquant  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#148:1:A>
And instead of the budget constraint <,> this becomes a cost line  
<,> isocostline and wherever they are tangential <,> there it is a question  
of commodity substitution <,> here it will be a question of fact of  
substitution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#149:1:A>
The terminology is different <,> the context is different but the  
tool is the same <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#150:1:A>
At the foundation of economic analysis <,> you have dispariding of  
thinking <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-032#151:1:A>
That is the first point I wanted to present to you <,> because if  
you say what is at the foundation of micro economic is <,> this behaviour is  
disparidgm <,,> </I>
