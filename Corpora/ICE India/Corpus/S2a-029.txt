<ICE-IND:S2A-029#1:1:A>
Hello <,,> you know <,> his importance <,,> I deserve as a
direct student of Gujral <,,> and the influence is very much there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#2:1:A>
That is why it has that philosophical <,,> basis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#3:1:A>
And uhm <,> if you do not understand phenomenology <,,> lot of
modern critical theory <,> will not be understood because you know <,> they
based their <,,> idea on <,,> phenomenology <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#4:1:A>
The idea of subjectivity we all <,> these days <-> we </-> talk
about <,,> subjectivity <,,> and phenomenology emphasises <,,> subjectivity
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#5:1:A>
You know <,,> how the subject is constituted <,,> interesting <,,>
idea <,,> and as a feminist <,,> literature <,> feminist theory <,> you
always come across <,,> the idea of subjectivity how the subject is
constituted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#6:1:A>
Woman as a subject <,,> how it is constituted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#7:1:A>
Uhm it is a cultural <,,> construction <,> <w> it's </w> not a
biological construction like someone who would say <,,> <quote> the woman was
not born she was made <,> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#8:1:A>
I am not a <.> bo </.> I am not a born woman I was made a woman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#9:1:A>
So the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea <w> it's </w>
very <,,> you know the historical construction <,> of the idea of the
subjectivity <,,> and phenomenology <,,> emphasise the idea of subjectivity
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#10:1:A>
And subsequently it became a problematical idea <,,> that uh <,>
the notion of the subject <,,> the constitution of the subject how the
subject is constituted <,,> is not an easy thing to <,,> say you know <w>
it's </w> not something that <,,> is result <,> uh taken for granted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#11:1:A>
And the relationship between the subject and the object <,,> who is
the subject who is the object <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#12:1:A>
Uh sometimes you feel <,,> that the object perhaps is the subject
you know <,> so subject object <,> axis <,,> is very complex <,,> and
phenomenology I repeat it <,> emphasise <,,> that notion <,,> of subjectivity
<,,> <w> that's </w> why it is called subjective criticism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#13:1:A>
Whose subjectivity you can ask <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#14:1:A>
The readers <,,> the writers <,,> there is also narrator involved
in the process of <,,> narrative <,,> <-> the </-> all subjects <,> the
reader is a subject <,,> the writer is a subject <,,> the character who
narrates is a subject <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#15:1:A>
So whose subjectivity <,,> and how one subjectivity is imbricated
with another <,> you know <,> these are all complex say <,,> philosophical
problems <,,> particularly when you deal with the narrativity <,,> you come
across <,,> these kind of interesting <,> uh I would say that colonical <,>
of <,,> very <,> interesting <,> notions about subjectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#16:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why you know subjectivity

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#17:1:A>
Objectivity is a very <,> <-> is a </-> false notion <,,> according
to these <,,> there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective
<,,> objective <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#18:1:A>
You assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of
<,> immense neutrality <,> which is a kind of objectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#19:1:A>
Is it possible to do that <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#20:1:A>
The world also <,> as a subject is constituted <,,> by your
consciousness <,,> if individual response to the world in his own particular
way <,,> where to get the sense of objectivity

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#21:1:A>
How is it that you want to be objective <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#22:1:A>
What is the basis of objectivity <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#23:1:A>
And who actually makes the basis <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#24:1:A>
The very fact that you <,,> define objectivity you are already <,>
implicated into <,> the very definition <,,> which is your personal
definition <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#25:1:A>
That is why <w> it's </w> a very very false notion the idea of
objectivity <,> there is nothing called objectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#26:1:A>
One is relatively <,,> uh you can say <,> uh relatively <,> know
like subjectivity and objectivity <,> or subjectivity refers to the subject
objectivity <,> refers to the object <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#27:1:A>
And the <,> does the object exist independently <,,> of your
consciousness <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#28:1:A>
How does the object get <-> a </-> realised <,,> do you <,>
perceive <,> a thing <,,> all of you in a same way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#29:1:A>
When you come into the room <,,> your eyes you know <,,> glances at
something <,> not the entire thing <,> and the same eye of another person
doesn't glance <,,> at the same thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#30:1:A>
So there is all like all I say <,> you the sense of perception <,>
had already reduced things <,,> into some kind of selectional it has already
selected <,,> which thing to see and which thing to exclude <,> from vision
from perception <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#31:1:A>
So the act of perception itself is a selective art <,,> and when
the process of selection has already taken place <,,> in in a mental <,> uh
you know when when it is in a mental process <,,> that the idea of
objectivity is lost

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#32:1:A>
You don't see the whole world <,> together at a time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#33:1:A>
You see piecemeal <,,> and it comes to you through fragments <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#34:1:A>
And the very fact that you will be selective <,,> uh whether you
like it or not you are selective in your glance <,> in your vision <,,> that
actually negates the very idea of objectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#35:1:A>
How do you then make sense of the world <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#36:1:A>
If the world is such a vast thing which you can't see <,,> at a
time everything <,> how do you then make sense of the world <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#37:1:A>
Can you really objectively say that the world is like this <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#38:1:A>
You know <,,> so these are all illusions <,,> and uh western
philosophers particularly <,,> created the notion of objectivity <,,> as an
idea <w> it's </w> a kind of platonic fallacy you can say <,,> something <,>
exterior exists <,,> and we intuitively realise <w> it's </w> sense it and
the very idea of intuition <,> perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that
you have some <}> <-> <.> intui </.> </-> <=> intuition </=> </}> <,,> in
your think in your perception <,,> that negates the idea of subjectivity <,>
uh objectivity

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#39:1:A>
So <,> phenomenology says that <,,> objectivity is nothing <w> it's
</w> just an illusion <,,> and everything perception is personal subjective
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#40:1:A>
You see things the way you want to see them <,> sometimes you
refuse to see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#41:1:A>
Deliberately you <,> do not like to see things because you don't
like to see them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#42:1:A>
But <,> your vision is always selective <,> in its own way <,,> it
always selects things <,,> from a mass of events mass of things that <-> you
<,,> uh </-> are scattered around you <,,> you select a few <,,> because
perhaps <,,> in a very <,> <}> <-> <.> i i </.> </-> <=> interesting </=>
</}> <,> way logical way become some to your <,> uh thinking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#43:1:A>
So you select something that confirms to <,,> your line of thinking
and so on and so forth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#44:1:A>
So basically <,> any kind of response <,,> is a subjective response
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#45:1:A>
That is a case which phenomenology makes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#46:1:A>
You read a text <,> you like it or you don't like it <,,> yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#47:1:B>
Sir <,> phenomenology is <,,> the operate <,> experience at
subjective level

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#48:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#49:1:B>
But uh <,,> at its various uh <,> student criticism <,> like
uh <,> as you referred to rather the guidance of these landmarks <,> feminist
criticism or even black literature and <,,> so forth and so on <O> cough </O>
there <,> since <?> phenolism </?> phenomenology applies to a sort of group
volunteers

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#50:1:A>
Yes <,> it is a group concept I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#51:1:B>
So how this <,,> various or even the idea of new colonisation
example literary criticism or <,,> literary creation <,> so all this
interpretation <-> are </-> can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology
only <,> in a way <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#52:1:A>
You can do that you can say that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#53:1:A>
If there is some <,> if there is a kind of group response <,,> and
the collective response to something <,> like you have mentioned the
feminists or the blacks <,,> there have been

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#54:1:B>
From the third world

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#55:1:A>
Any way <O> cough </O> <,> but if there are variations <,,> if
you look at the individual <,,> but there is something called and I <,> that
is why I say that <,,> and it varies from group to group it varies from
person to person and within group there are lot of divergences <,,> and you
can take note of that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#56:1:A>
If we account for all those <,,> divergences <,,> within <,> the
commonality <,> which is a kind of <O> one word </O> <,> imposed upon those
desperate tendencies <,,> in individual perception

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#57:1:B>
In fact every individuals movements <,,> breaks down before it
<{> <[> takes off </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#58:1:A>
<[> Naturally </[> </{> <,> naturally

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#59:1:B>
Nature of the very idea of phenomenology

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#60:1:A>
Naturally <,> so it is the very basis <,> of human perception
<,,> you

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#61:1:B>
<O> A few words </O> they were talking about their
Commonwealth <,> now they say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#62:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> about these this </[> whole idea <,> but you know
commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#63:1:A>
There is no Commonwealth response

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#64:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#65:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#66:1:A>
You can say there may <{> <[> be a third </[> world reference

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#67:1:B>
<[> But they didn't </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#68:1:B>
But they didn't talked about it to start with

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#69:1:A>
See they talked about it but you see <,> how can you then say
the Australian response is similar to Indian response or the Canadian
response <,> Commonwealth within Commonwealth if they belong to the first
world

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#70:1:B>
But still they didn't talked about it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-029#71:1:A>
See this is as I say it is a desperate ideas <,> yoked in
violence you know <w> it's </w> kind of hetrogenity <,,> and that also is a
very debatable idea <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#72:1:A>
Is there any communality of <,,> this kind of political term which
unites <,> the erstwhile colonies <,,> but <-> the response of </-> a
Canadian response certainly is closer to the American response than <,> uh uh
an Indian response

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#73:1:A>
And you can't <,> uh uh say that a first world country like Canada
<,,> uh response <-> this </-> in the same way <,,> as a third world country

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#74:1:A>
So there is a lot of variations <,,> but uh phenomenology doesn't
talk of course of a group response kind of thing

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#75:1:A>
They talk of individual <,> and they don't really like the idea of
this collective <,,> response is like collective action <,,> and if they name
it some we will talk about that later on a slightly <,> when we talk about to
reader response criticism <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#76:1:A>
But the collective response idea also <,> is self contradictory
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#77:1:A>
Response cannot be collective <,,> because two people two persons
do not think alike <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#78:1:A>
And you group them together and say you think alike <,,> and you
can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#79:1:A>
Your own response is so spontaneous <,,> you can only politically
manipulate the whole <,> thinking process <,,> even to suit your convenience
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#80:1:A>
It is a political manipulation <,> of human mind can be controlled
technologically you know <,,> but <,> human response certainly <,> tries to
evade <,> this kind of technologing of the spirit <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#81:1:A>
Spirit could not be technologised in way you want them <,> want it
to be <,> technologised <,,> but you can't even say you can't say <,> there
is nothing called collective response <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#82:1:A>
Blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of
interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#83:1:A>
There is certainly when it comes to <,> the the <,> question of
white domination <,> they certainly respond in very general way <,,> about
the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth <,> and that
is the kind of

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#84:1:A>
But it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal
more intensely <,> with how you percieve things <,,> how things get realised
in your consciousness get realised in your perception <,> how things take
shape in your mind <,,> so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to
Ferrel <,> you refer <,> you induce it to some kind of <,> ideatic <,>
ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh <,> reduction <,> ideatic reduction or
reflection <,> idea <,> if now reduced to that level <,> of perception <,>
perceptual you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#85:1:A>
And a concept <,> arises out of the <,> innate perceptuality <,> of
her idea <,> so that innate perception you perceive <,> then you
conceptualise

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#86:1:A>
First <,> is perceive <,,> you perceive in your mental eye <,,> and
that perceptuality of every <.> ob </.> the object <,> gets realised <,>
through your perceptuality your perception <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#87:1:A>
There is no object until <,> you see it <,,> in your mental eyes

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#88:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not just a visual perception but is a very <,> uh as
you know is a very is a mental perception <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#89:1:A>
You perceive the object <,,> and suddenly the object take shape in
your mind <,> then <,> you conceptualise about it

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#90:1:A>
Conceptualisation is a <,> cerebral process <,> that takes place
only after <,> the mental perception <-> takes place </-> <,,> has taken
place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#91:1:A>
This is the way <,,> all visible objects are reduced to <,,> modes
<,,> by which you perceive <,> an inner reality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#92:1:A>
As I say that it has some complicity with the plutonic <,> idea of
essence <,> that the whole world is reduced to the object <,,> in a very
miniature way

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#93:1:A>
In a miniature way the the visible world that you see <,> is a
miniature copy of the idea <,> the essence <,> which has occured <,> it has
that kind of traditional <,> plutonic kind of notions <,> of the visible and
the invisible axis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#94:1:A>
What you see visible <,> is only a manifestation of the invisible
perception <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#95:1:A>
The mind works <,,> in its own way <,> and makes things possible
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#96:1:A>
So the object gets realised to a mental process <,> and then <,> it
becomes manifested through <,> the phenomenology of the object <,> which is a
manifestation <,> is possible <,> because of the mental perception <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#97:1:A>
This is the idea of the ideatic reduction <,,> bracketing <,>
everything is bracketed between you and the others

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#98:1:A>
So you <,> operate at a very higher level <,> of uh uhm <,>
relationship between the object <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#99:1:A>
So the objectivity is not uh <,> nothing is objective per se <,>
there is nothing called objectivity per se <,> you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#100:1:A>
Objectivity is a realisation <,> of the higher mode of
subjectivity <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#101:1:A>
Objectivity <,> the <.> id </.> object <,> objectivity is the
whole idea the objectiveness <,> objectivity the object <,,> uh the
objectiveness the object <,,> the objectness objectivity is <,> objectness
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#102:1:A>
So the objectness <,,> which you call objectivity <,> the very
quality of the object <,,> is manifested through your subjective perception
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#103:1:A>
That is why <,> where do you get the <,> idea of objectivity <,,>
uh without you know some subjectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#104:1:A>
Subjectivity makes the objectness possible <,> objectivity is
possible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#105:1:A>
So the object and subject come together <,,> in a very mystical
way <,> and that is why consciousness <,,> is the consciousness of an object
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#106:1:A>
You cannot have subjectivity without objectivity <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#107:1:A>
You cannot have objectivity without subjectivity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#108:1:A>
This is the subject object relationship <,,> and uh <,> the whole
world <,,> the whole perception <,> of the perceptual world <,> is possible
<,> because of this axis <,> because of this relationship between the subject
and the object <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#109:1:A>
Am I clear <,> on this <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#110:1:A>
Okay <,,> this is the basis of phenomenology <,,> and as you know
<,> as you know already rightly pointed out <,> that this is the fundamental
<,> uh way by which <,,> you realise the object <,> that you see around you
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-029#111:1:A>
The world comes <,> becomes visible <,,> because of the mental <,>
already mental process <,> which was on <,> and you create the object <,,> in
your own perception <,,> </I>
