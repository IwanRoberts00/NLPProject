<h> <bold> Campus Debate </bold> </h> <&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#2:1>
by DILEEP PATWARDHAN </&> <&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#3:1>
<bold> Indian-American Dinesh <w> D'souza's </w> book on the politics
of race and gender on American campuses - - which has won rave reviews and
provoked angry outbursts - - asserts that mindless affirmative action
policies and <quote> " politically correct" </quote> thinking have stiffed
academic freedom. </p> </bold> </&> <&> in two columns </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#4:1>
The three most striking developments in American higher education
in the past 30 years have been the transformation of the campus from a white
male preserve to one of racial and gender diversity; establishment of
specialized departments for the study of ethnic, gender, and international
issues; and a phenomenal increase in the number of foreign students,
particularly from the developing world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#5:1>
We in India who have been watching the American higher education
scene, have considered these changes positive and enriching - - until Dinesh
<w> D'souza's </w> <it> <mention> Illiberal Education </mention> </it> came
along. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#6:1>
The complete title of the book, <it> <mention> Illiberal
Education: </mention> The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus </it> <sp>
*</sp>, succinctly describes the thrust of the book and spells out <w>
D'Souza's </w> major concerns about the current state of American higher
education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#7:1>
The American campus once provided an intellectual and harmonious
environment conducive to the free flow of ideas; it gave impetus to
creativity and individual growth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#8:1>
But today, laments D'Souza, it has been politicized over issues of
race and gender to such an extent that it is capable of providing only
illiberal education in an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#9:1>
D'Souza sees academic freedom being stifled, and group interests
being given precedence over individual rights and meritoracy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#10:1>
He attributes this slide to selfish, shortsighted, and mindless
affirmative action policies of university administrations, abetted by
their <quote> " politically correct" </quote> supporters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#11:1>
D'Souza observes that those who call themselves <quote> " politically
correct," </quote> though in a minority, have succeeded in unleashing a
tyranny that is eating up the very vitals of American higher education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#12:1>
They stand for multiculturalism, feminism, and diversity in the
curriculum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#13:1>
D'Souza uses the case study approach, citing concrete examples
for illustrating his arguments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#14:1>
He lays bare the inner workings and the resultant injustice of
race-based admissions at the University of California, Berkeley; explains the
dynamics of black protest at Howard University in Washington, D.C., exposing
its hollowness and superficiality; and examines the University of <w>
Michigan's </w> efforts to protect minorities by imposing <*> line </*>
<O> <&> This book is available at American Center libraries in Bombay,
calcutta, and New Delhi. </&> </O> restrictions on this liberal campus <w>
community's </w> speech, expression, and behavior. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#15:1>
Against the background of these disturbing trends, D'Souza
discusses how minority and politically correct activists have diluted the
objectivity, scholarly content, and rigor of the curriculum at Stanford
University in Stanford, California, and Duke University in Durham, North
Carolina.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#16:1>
He says that at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the
<w> faculty's </w> academic freedom has been compromised by an aggressive and
committed ethnic and feminist minority that has charged the faculty with
being insensitive, if not bigoted, on race and gender issues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#17:1>
Faced with such charges, and with no support from the weak and
apathetic university administration, the faculty has dropped controversial
courses and submitted itself to censorship, with knowledge and freedom as
the casualties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#18:1>
D'Souza has selected the six universities mentioned above for
special consideration because they are in the <quote> " vanguard of the
revolution of minority victims" </quote> and as such are role models for
others.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#19:1>
He also alludes to other campuses to show that the experiences
described are universal.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#20:1>
While giving an insight into the <quote> " politics of race and sex"
</quote> and a ringside view of university administrations' decision-making
processes, D'Souza makes several significant comments about American academic
in the broader perspective of the American democratic process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#21:1>
He recognizes that American higher education has a responsibility
to bring into the academic mainstream minority races and women who have
historically been deprived of higher education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#22:1>
He firmly believes that higher education in multi-racial America
should not be the preserve of the white male.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#23:1>
Thus, D'Souza is not arguing against affirmative action <foreign> per
se </foreign> but rather against the ways in which it has been implemented.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#24:1>
He calls for an affirmative action policy that is in keeping with <w>
America's </w> commitment to individual rights and freedoms, one that would
avoid polarizing the campus into warring groups.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#25:1>
D'Souza urges that the pace, nature and execution of reforms be
worked out meticulously and sagaciously, so that they would not invite a
backlash from favorably disposed but status quo oriented whites. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#26:1>
D'Souza offers some rather sketchy, tentative, and <quote> "
modest" </quote> proposals at the end of the book.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#27:1>
His first recommendation is <O> <&> page </&> 40 </O> <O> photograph
</O> that universities continue with their <quote> " policies of preferential
treatment but alter their criteria of application from race to socioeconomic
disadvantage." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#28:1>
He is obviously trying to improve upon <w> Berkeley's </w>
experiment, which has endeavored to diversify the student body according to
the proportions in which racial groups are represented in <w> California's
</w> population.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#29:1>
This has created a situation in which many Asians and whites with
superior test and academic records cannot find places while blacks and
Hispanics with average records can.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#30:1>
D'Souza would like to avoid such <quote> " social engineering"
</quote> that totally ignores equity, achievement and excellence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#31:1>
Under his proposals, admission officers will consider <quote> "
the <w> applicant's </w> family back-ground, financial condition, and primary
and secondary school environment." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#32:1>
If this record suggests that the <w> student's </w> undistinguished
performance was not due to <quote> " lack of ability or application but
rather to demonstrated disadvantage," </quote> the applicant would be
admitted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#33:1>
This solution does pose some practical problems regarding the
availability and verification of data.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#34:1>
While admissions based on race are mechanically given and candidates
are treated as members of a group, admissions based on socioeconomic criteria
would be made on individual basis only after careful evaluation of each <w>
student's </w> learning and growth potential.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#35:1>
Processing individual cases would prove cumbersome and time
consuming.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#36:1>
D'souza contends, however, that information required for making
admission decisions is available in university admissions and financial aid
offices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#37:1>
By replacing race with socioeconomic criteria, preferential
treatment for admission would be extended to a larger pool of applicants,
thus reducing opportunities for blacks and Hispanics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#38:1>
Anticipating criticism, D'Souza is quick to counter by pointing out
that if being a member of a race can be <quote> " shown to translate into
socioeconomic disadvantage currently suffered by the student applicant"
</quote> he would continue to benefit under the scheme.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#39:1>
The number of racial minorities admitted to schools will not
diminish, only they will be getting into universities they academically
deserve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#40:1>
<w> D'Souza's </w> second recommendation aims at arresting the
growth of separatism among minority students on the campus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#41:1>
The author offers various explanations for a <w> minority's </w>
coolness toward integration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#42:1>
He says an admission process that gives preferential treatment
to ethnic minorities ironically does not benefit them because they are so
inadequately prepared academically that it is difficult for them to compete
with highly motivated and meritorious students at prestigious
universities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#43:1>
The minority dropout rate at Berkeley is high; fewer than 40 percent
of entering blacks and 50 percent of entering Hispanics graduate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#44:1>
The blacks and Hispanics, lured to the campus with offers of
scholarships and other financial incentives, are told that because of their
backgrounds and viewpoints they are helping to produce a <quote> " dynamic
intellectual environment" </quote> and <quote> " richer undergraduate
experience." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#45:1>
Consequently, their poor performance comes as a rude shock and a
blow to their self-esteem.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#46:1>
In their despondency, the blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians
supported by foreign students, feminists, and homo-sexuals blame the <w>
university's </w> racist structure and <quote> " white curriculum" </quote>
for their poor performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#47:1>
In this gloomy situation, minorities find solace within their own
ethnic groupings such as the Rainbow Coalition at Stanford.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#48:1>
The minorities <quote> " tend to develop group consciousness and
collective orientation partly as a protective strategy." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#49:1>
Some black organizations encourage <quote> " anti-intellectualism"
</quote> instead of starting remedial programs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#50:1>
Minorities are told learning is <quote> " acting white." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#51:1>
It would seem that Martin Luther King, <w> Jr.'s </w> movement for
equal rights and integration is being effectively challenged by Malcolm <w>
X's </w> ideology of separation and Black Power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#52:1>
It is a <quote> " fight between Martin and Malcolm." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#53:1>
Historian Arthur Schlesinger aptly remarks, <quote> " The meltings
pot has yielded to the Tower of Babel." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#54:1>
The university policy of establishing separate dormitories,
cultural houses, and organizations for ethnic minorities also unwittingly
encourages separatism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#55:1>
The extreme case is that of California State University at
Sacramento, which is planning an entirely separate <quote> " college within a
college" </quote> for blacks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#56:1>
Whites, meanwhile are becoming bitter about race-based admissions,
faculty hiring practices, behavior codes, and sensitivity <O> <&> page </&> 41
</O> training that they perceive as being selectively used against
them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#57:1>
They charge that double standards are being applied in the way
university leaderships cultivate minority organizations and in the care and
tenderness with which they handle the campus protests of minorities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#58:1>
Having discussed the crucial issue of multiculturalism throughout
the book, <w> D'Souza's </w> proposed solution is indeed disproportionately
brief and inadequate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#59:1>
As he has proposed in the case of race-based admissions, D'Souza
wants the university to refuse to recognize and fund any group that is
<quote> " racially separatist and excludes students based on skin color."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#60:1>
He wants ethnicity and gender to cease to be criteria; he would
replace them with intellectual or cultural interests.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#61:1>
D'Souza rightly points out that <quote> " thought and expression are
the currency in which universities trade and speculate" </quote> and that
universities therefore have no business in supporting nonacademic
politically popular causes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#62:1>
The third proposal is made in connection with courses classified
under the broad rubric of non-Western, ethnic, and gender studies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#63:1>
When more than 20 years ago such studies were introduced in American
universities, they fulfilled an important need for covering intellectual and
geographical areas of study that had been largely neglected.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#64:1>
Eurocentric views had long dominated liberal arts education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#65:1>
The new courses opened the window on the history of minority groups
and non-Western cultures.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#66:1>
This perspective was reinforced with visiting faculty and students
from foreign countries, and new opportunities wre created for Americans to
study, teach, and perform research abroad.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#67:1>
As a visiting faculty member teaching Indian civilization at a
Midwestern liberal arts college in the early 1970s, I personally experienced
the success of this internationalization.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#68:1>
I still vividly recall curious and eager American youth learning
about faraway Indian and the masterful term paper one of them wrote on
Emperor Akbar at the end of the semester. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#69:1>
However, more recently, <w> America's </w> academia has been
polarized between the politically correct scholars, who have made issues of
race, gender, and class central to their teaching and research, and the
traditionalists who advocate the study of Western civilization and culture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#70:1>
The latter claim to have an <quote> " objective" </quote> approach to
scholarship and believe that it is important for Americans to study first the
civilization to which they belong before venturing to comprehend more exotic
cultures.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#71:1>
In their view, politically correct scholars allow their radical
political agenda to taint their scholarship and teaching.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#72:1>
In support of this contention they cite the example of the
politically correct describing Western culture as <quote> " racist, sexist,
and oppressive," </quote> ignoring its many nobler aspects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#73:1>
Research in non-Western areas is done selectively from the Western
perspective, the true culture eluding the researcher.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#74:1>
The teaching of non-Western courses leaves much to be desired and
students take them because they are trendy, thin in substance, and hence easy
to pass.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#75:1>
Western culture courses, on the other hand, argue the
traditionalists, are rich in content and <O> photograph of Book <mention>
ILLIBERAL EDUCATION </mention> etc., corner of column <&> therefore hard to
master. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#76:1>
D'Souza, who sides with the traditionalists, is particularly
harsh on AfroAmerican and <w> women's </w> studies programs, which he
thinks are committed to an activist ideology of the 1960s, closed to academic
argument, and <quote> " hostile to alternative views." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#77:1>
He finds these programs more political than scholarly and agrees with
sociologist Walter Allen that the <quote> " departments play an affirmative
action role" </quote> by providing opportunities to hire minority faculty.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#78:1>
Not academically serious, they are <quote> " tolerated but never
fully accepted by traditional or mainstream fields." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#79:1>
D'Souza calls Harvard <w> women's </w> studies professor Alice <w>
Jardine's </w> class <quote> " so esoteric and yet so vulgar, so freewheeling
and yet so dogmatic, so full of political energy and yet ultimately so
futile." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#80:1>
Considering that there are some 350 Afro-American and 500 <w>
women's </w> studies programs in American universities, <w> D'Souza's </w>
blanket condemnation appears too sweeping.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#81:1>
Western civilization and culture, and non-Western, ethnic, and
gender programs, complement each other.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#82:1>
Together they should really form the core of liberal arts education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#83:1>
Realizing this D'Souza suggests universities devise <quote> " a
required course or sequence for entering freshmen which exposes them to the
basic issue of equality and human difference, through a carefully chosen set
of classic texts that deal powerfully with those issues." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#84:1>
This is not a novel concept and has been tried before.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#85:1>
A required course or sequence for entering freshmen will only be a
token effort given the significance of the subject matter involved and the
richness of materials available for teaching and research. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-012#86:1>
The book and the <w> author's </w> recommendations gain
signifilcance given the <w> author's </w> background.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#87:1>
An Indian expatriate, D'Souza, 31, studied at prestigious Dartmouth
College in New Hampshire, wrote for conservative journals like <it> National
Review </it> , authored with Gregory Fossdal the biography of
tele-vision evangelist Jerry Falwell, worked for the Reagan White House,
and is now a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#88:1>
With such impeccable conservative credentials, one would expect his
work to be polemical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#89:1>
Surprisingly, this representative of the pugnacious right is
balanced, understanding, and even somewhat sympathetic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#90:1>
Perhaps his Indian background has something to do with this
restraint.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#91:1>
As a Roman Catholic, D'Souza belonged to a religious minority in
India and well knew what it was like living in a multicultural society that
faces some of the same problems as those in America.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#92:1>
India is struggling to reflect its multiculturalism in its own
curricula, to bring its scheduled caste and tribes into the academic
mainstream, and to effect a compromise between its <quote> " politically
correct" </quote> left and traditionalists of the right.

<ICE-IND:W2B-012#93:1>
This lucid, analytical, and bold book will therefore be of interest
to Indians, particularly those in academia. </p> <*> small square </*> <&>
