The scientist <,> philosophers and technologist <,> are unanimous
<,> on one point <,,> <quote> Mathematics falls <,> far short of their
expectations <,> in coping with reality </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#19:1:A>
Let us probe a little deeper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#20:1:A>
Consider the following three questions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#21:1:A>
Question one <,,> <quote> What will be the distance of the planet
Neptune <,> from Earth <,> on March <,> twenty-eight <,> two thousand and one
</quote> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#22:1:A>
Question two <,,> <quote> Who will win maximum world medals in the
forth coming Olympics </quote> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#23:1:A>
Question three <,,> <quote> Will the world be better <,,> to live
in <,,> by the turn of the century </quote> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#24:1:A>
The first question <,,> <mention> the question about distance
</mention> <,,> is precise <,,> <-> and is </-> <,,> and it is possible to
give <,> a reasonably precise answer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#25:1:A>
In some cases <,> a precise answer <,,> may not be possible at the
present level of technological development <,,> but there is <,,> a general
consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#26:1:A>
The questions of this type <,,> can be handled <,> with admirably
adequate efficiency by present day mathematics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#27:1:A>
The second question <,> about the medals <,,> falls <,> in the
different category <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#28:1:A>
Though the question is precise <,,> the precise answer is not
possible <,,> till the event actually takes place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#29:1:A>
These are speculating questions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#30:1:A>
And there probablistic answers can be given <,> with the help of
<,> statistical theory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#31:1:A>
However <,,> it is the third type of question which is of primary
importance <,,> to me in my <w> today's </w> talk <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#32:1:A>
<quote> Will the world be a better place to live in <,> by the turn
of the century </quote> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#33:1:A>
Such type of questions <,> cover very vast areas of our cognition
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#34:1:A>
Most of the real life problems <,> belongs to this category <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#35:1:A>
The formulation <,,> of these types of question <,> is <,> in a
very vague language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#36:1:A>
The meaning of the question <,,> may change <,> not only from
person to person <,> but from time to time <,> for the same person <,,> and
yet the question is quite meaningful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#37:1:A>
All of us will agree <,,> that this world needs <,> much to be
desired <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#38:1:A>
But the prescription of the <}> <-> <.> better </.> </-> <,> <=>
betterment </=> </}> of the world <,> changes from person to person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#39:1:A>
<quote> Will everybody be happy <,> if he or she is rich </quote>
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#40:1:A>
Let us not labour on happiness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#41:1:A>
Philosophers have written volumes <,> on the state of happiness <,>
and the ways to achieve it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#42:1:A>
But nobody seems to have been benefitted <,> from the <,> reading
<+> of </+> those books <,> except their publishers <,> and possibly their
authors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#43:1:A>
But <,,> what about the richness <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#44:1:A>
The word <mention> richness </mention> <,> has many shades <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#45:1:A>
But <w> I'm </w> using it in a very <,> mundane earthly sense <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#46:1:A>
How much wealth one should amass <,,> so that one is called rich
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#47:1:A>
Rockfeller is rich <,,> so is Ford <,,> an average Indian is not
rich <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#48:1:A>
So <,,> I think <,> there is <,,> some standard on which <,> all of
us agree <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#49:1:A>
But such agreement <,> does not last long <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#50:1:A>
A person <,> whom I consider <,,> very rich <,> may be an average
middle class commoner <,> in the sense of <,> Rockfeller <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#51:1:A>
Thus the concept of richness <,> seems to be <,> highly subjective
<,,> relative <,> or <,,> self referential <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#52:1:A>
Besides <,,> who should be call rich <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#53:1:A>
One whose annual income is <,> say five million <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#54:1:A>
And if <,> the answer is affirmative <,,> what about the one <,>
whose income is little less than that <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#55:1:A>
Say <,,> forty-five hundred thousand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#56:1:A>
And <,> this argument will continue <,> till a stage is reached <,>
where one cannot decide <,> whether a person <,> getting the specific amount
would be placed <,> in the category of rich persons or not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#57:1:A>
For one may seek <,,> any threshold for deciding <,> the richness
<,,> but a person earning <,> little less than the limit <,> need not be
considered non-rich <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#58:1:A>
Thus <,,> the so called threshold <,,> is not only highly arbitrary
<,> but extremely foggy <,> and indiscernible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#59:1:A>
And still the question is meaningful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#60:1:A>
Most of the questions of real world are of this nature <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#61:1:A>
They are fuzzy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#62:1:A>
So what causes fuzziness <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#63:1:A>
There are several factors <,> which contribute to fuzziness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#64:1:A>
Let me mention <,> some of them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#65:1:A>
Natural language <,,> the first <,> and foremost among the causes
of fuzziness <,> is <,> the intrinsic weakness <,> of natural languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#66:1:A>
Again <,> it is very much debatable <,> whether it is <}> <-> a
</-> <+> the </+> </}> strength <,> or <,> the weakness <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#67:1:A>
But <,,> there are no two opinions that <,> there is some <O> one
word </O> vagueness in all natural languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#68:1:A>
Consider for example <,> the following <,> adjectives <,,> uh
<mention> tall <,> fellow </mention> <,,> an <mention> intelligent lady
</mention> <,,> a <mention> handsome youth </mention> <,,> or for that matter
<,> the following sentences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#69:1:A>
<mention> If you work <,> a little harder <,,> you will get much
more <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#70:1:A>
Heavier vehicle <,> should be driven <,> more cautiously <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#71:1:A>
The more <,,> they change <,,> the more they are the same
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#72:1:A>
Though <,> all these are very much meaningful sentences their
meaning is never precise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#73:1:A>
The second factor <,> contributing to fuzziness <,> is <,,>
subjective <,> preferences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#74:1:A>
Added to intrinsic fuzziness of <,> a language <,,> there is some
subjective element related <,> to the user <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#75:1:A>
The same word <,> may have different meanings <,,> at different
places <,> to different persons <,> at different times <,> and in different
circumstances <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#76:1:A>
A young man of twenty-five year <,> will consider a fifty year old
<,> man a <,> old man <,> but <,,> if you ask the opinion of <,> the fifty
year old <,> on the same question <,> he will say <,> that <quote> <w> he's
</w> quite young and energetic </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#77:1:A>
Uh there is a very beautiful story about uh <,,> this <,> in
<indig> Vedas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#78:1:A>
Well it is not <,> written here <,,> uh completely <,,> <quote>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#79:1:A>
Prajapati <,,> <}> <-> the <.> sup </.> </-> <,> <=> the supreme
</=> </}> Creator <,,> was once approached <,,> by humans <,,> god <,,> and
monster <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#80:1:A>
Prajapati created them all <,,> but they were unhappy <,> in his
world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#81:1:A>
So they asked him <,> to advise them </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#82:1:A>
Prajapati said <,,> <quote> C C C </quote> <,,> I mean <,,> capital
<,> C <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#83:1:A>
The <,,> human thought <,,> that they were greedy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#84:1:A>
They wanted everything for themselves <,,> that must be the cause
of their grief <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#85:1:A>
So Prajapati must have told them <,,> to show <,> charity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#86:1:A>
Charity starts with C <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#87:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> G </.> </-> <=> god </=> </}> thought <,,> that they
were <,> pleasure seekers <,,> they all the time sitting in the heavens <,>
drinking nector <,,> and <,> engaged in sensual pleasure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#88:1:A>
So <,> god <,,> uh the Prajapati <,> asked them <,> to control
themselves <,,> and <,,> not to allow their passions <,> to <,,> take better
of them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#89:1:A>
Monsters thought <,,> that they were cruel <,,> and unkind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#90:1:A>
They did not care for miseries of others <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#91:1:A>
That must be the cause of their own misery <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#92:1:A>
So Prajapati <,> asked them to show <,> compassion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#93:1:A>
Thus <,,> C became <,> charity for men <,,> control for god <,,>
compassion <,> for <,,> monsters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#94:1:A>
Well <,,> let us assume <,> that in this type of questions some
psychological factors are <}> <-> <.> in </.> </-> <=> involved </=> </}>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#95:1:A>
So let us consider the problem of <,> controlling <,> warmness of
water <,,> in shower bath <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#96:1:A>
Here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person <,>
particular time particular place particular season <,> and above all the
particular mental or physical condition of the user <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#97:1:A>
Note that <,> this problem <,> unlike the earlier one <,,> is not
of academic interest <,> but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower
bath <,> equipments <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#98:1:A>
And hence <,,> for <,> control engineers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#99:1:A>
The third factor that contributes to fuzziness <,> is inadequacy of
information <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#100:1:A>
Many a time <,> there is no sufficient knowledge <,,> of the
system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#101:1:A>
For example <,> scientist is always aware <,> that <,,> he knows
no final truth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#102:1:A>
He may be sceptic even about well established theory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#103:1:A>
On the frontiers of knowledge <,> he is always on slippery ground
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#104:1:A>
If in addition <,,> the data is <}> <-> <.> ana </.> </-> <=>
inadequate </=> </}> <,,> everything becomes <,,> a matter of <,> guess work
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#105:1:A>
Then all he has to rely upon <,> is <,,> a working hypothesis <,>
based on <,> state of the <.> aa </.> knowledge <,> and <,> unprovable basic
assumptions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#106:1:A>
These assumptions <,> can be a matter of <?> verbal </?>
perceptions <,> as <,,> in <,> medical and social problems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#107:1:A>
Sometimes <,> one has to infer not only from <,> insufficient data
<,> but also from information <,> which is not wholly reliable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#108:1:A>
For example if you are working with <,> strategies in the
battlefield <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#109:1:A>
Next factor <,> that contributes to fuzziness <,> is
interdependence <,> of concepts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#110:1:A>
A cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena <,> is a very <,,>
favourite concept of <,,> <}> <-> Indian <.> a </.> </-> <,> <=> ancient
Indian </=> </}> philosophers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#111:1:A>
And cycle has no cut points <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#112:1:A>
The seeds of decay <,> for an Indian philosopher are present <,>
in the growth itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#113:1:A>
The transformation of growth into decay <,,> is so subtle <,> that
you cannot put a demarcation line between them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#114:1:A>
Or let us be more plain <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#115:1:A>
If the demand of certain commodity increases <,> its <,> price <,>
rises <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#116:1:A>
But the rise in price <,> results in decrease in the demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#117:1:A>
The end affects the means <,> and the means affect the end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#118:1:A>
To win elections <,,> a political party has to take <,,> some
populist measures <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#119:1:A>
But <,> such measures <,,> result into deficient <,> deficit
financing <,,> and causes inflation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#120:1:A>
And prices rise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#121:1:A>
If the prices rise <,> it is <,> difficult to win in the elections
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#122:1:A>
This interdependents of concepts <,,> causes fuzziness in decision
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#123:1:A>
In complex systems like human body <,> or national <}> <-> <.> ec
</.> </-> <=> economy </=> </}> the effects of this fuzziness can be <,,>
very easily <,> observed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#124:1:A>
Complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#125:1:A>
In many real life problems <,> specially where human element is
involved <,> the system is so complex that it is impossible to control <,> or
even to take into account all the <,> affecting factors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#126:1:A>
Then it becomes a matter of personal choice <,> to decide which
factors are to be considered and which are <,> to be ignored <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#127:1:A>
And <,> such a choice in general is not easy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#128:1:A>
Then <,,> cost effectiveness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#129:1:A>
Many a time <,> it is <,,> theoritically possible to quantify <,,>
all the parametres of the system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#130:1:A>
But <,> the cost involved in doing so <,> is so huge <,> that <,>
it is more profitable to ignore certain factors <,,> and the choice of
relevant factors depends <,> many times on <,,> personal preferences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#131:1:A>
This causes <,> fuzziness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#132:1:A>
Fuzziness of concept <,> is an open invitation <,> to paradoxes
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#133:1:A>
Here are <,> some of them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#134:1:A>
Suppose <,> we have a small <,> heap of stones <,,> <mention>
small italics </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#135:1:A>
<mention> Smallness </mention> <,> is a fuzzy concept <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#136:1:A>
If we uh remove stones from heap <,> then of course <,> it will be
a smaller <,,> heap <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#137:1:A>
But even if we add a stone to a small heap <,> it will remain
small <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#138:1:A>
Now let us start <,> with <,,> the heap of a single stone <,,>
which is definitely small <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#139:1:A>
Since addition of the stone <,> does not affect the smallness of
the heap <,> one can go on adding <,> a stone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#140:1:A>
One stone at a time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#141:1:A>
And still continue to get a small heap <,,> this leads <,> to the
paradoxical situation <,> where every heap is small <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#142:1:A>
Another uhm paradox which I am going to <,,> state here is
<mention> Bonkare paradox </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#143:1:A>
We all know <,> that real numbers are totally ordered <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#144:1:A>
In this order <,> they are so densely close to each other <,> that
<,,> it is impossible <,> to separate consecutive real numbers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#145:1:A>
One can easily observe <,> that <,,> if <,> <mention> A </mention>
and <mention> B </mention> are two real numbers <,> however close to each
other <,> there is a number <,> <mention> A </mention> plus <mention> B
</mention> by two <,> that lies between them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#146:1:A>
In fact <w> they're </w> <,> there are uncountably many of them
lying between <mention> A </mention> and <mention> B </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#147:1:A>
Real numbers <,> can be represented as points <,> on an infinite
continual <,> uh <,,> a straight line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#148:1:A>
Any two adjacent points <}> <-> on the <.> con </.> </-> <=> on
the continuum </=> </}> <,> are so <,,> indistinguishable from each other <,>
that they almost overlap <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#149:1:A>
The last universalist <,> Henry Bonkare <,> described this
situation by the following formula <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#150:1:A>
<mention> A </mention> is equal to <mention> B </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#151:1:A>
<mention> B </mention> is equal to <mention> C </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#152:1:A>
But <mention> A </mention> is not equal to <mention> C </mention>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#153:1:A>
Uh <,,> an analogy of this mathematical contridiction <,> may be
<,> described in the following way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#154:1:A>
Suppose <,> we have <,> a whole spectrum of different shades of
colours <,> say <mention> red </mention> anything <,,> arranged in order <,>
of lightness of or <,> the percentage <,> of the redness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#155:1:A>
The change in two consecutive shades is so <,> minute <,,> and
gradual <,> that even a trained eye can not distinguish them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#156:1:A>
If <mention> S one S two S three </mention> <,> are three
neighbouring shades <,> then <mention> S one </mention> cannot be separated
from <mention> S two </mention> <,> nor can <mention> S two from S three
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#157:1:A>
However <,> <mention> S one </mention> can be separated from
<mention> S three </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#158:1:A>
And in this sense <mention> S one </mention> is equal to <mention>
S two </mention> <mention> S two </mention> is equal to <mention> S three
</mention> but <mention> S one </mention> is not equal to <mention> S three
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#159:1:A>
Finally <,> I talked of <,> <?> Bonkare </?> <,,> paradox <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#160:1:A>
This is an ancient paradox <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#161:1:A>
Also know as a paradox of a lier <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#162:1:A>
<?> Etimonised </?> <,,> <?> Etimonised </?> who himself <,,> a
<?> Cretin </?> says <,> that all <?> cretin </?> are liers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#163:1:A>
Now if <?> Etimonised </?> statement is <,,> true <,> then being a
lier himself <,,> his statement is fuzz <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#164:1:A>
On the other hand if his statement is fuzz <,> then he not being a
lier <,> may say true statement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#165:1:A>
Thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#166:1:A>
These paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put <,> in
precisely <,> expressed concepts into the rigour of Aristotlian logic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#167:1:A>
The classic case of fitting <,> a square pet in the round hole
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#168:1:A>
Naturally <,> there is an unbridgeable gap <,> between the two
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#169:1:A>
The deductive method <,> that we employ to derive theorems in
mathematics and logic <,> is based on the following three basic Aristotlian
laws <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#170:1:A>
<mention> Law of Identity </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#171:1:A>
<quote> A proposition is what it is <,,> or in symbols <,>
<mention> S </mention> is <mention> X </mention> </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#172:1:A>
The second law <,> <mention> Law of Excluded Middle </mention>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#173:1:A>
<quote> A proposition is <,,> either true or false <,> <mention> X
</mention> is <,> either <mention> Y </mention> or <,> not <mention> Y
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#174:1:A>
<quote> The Law of Contridiction </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#175:1:A>
No proposition <,> can be both <,> true and false <,,> <mention> X
</mention> can not be <,> <mention> Y </mention> <,> and not <mention> Y
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#176:1:A>
Just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad <,> we
have <,> in our above logic <,> either whole truth or <,> the whole untruth
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#177:1:A>
There is no room for partial truth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-047#178:1:A>
For this reason Aristotlian logic is called <,> two valued logic
<,,> </I>
