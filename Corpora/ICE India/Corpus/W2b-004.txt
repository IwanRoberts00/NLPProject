<ICE-IND:W2B-004#3:1>
It is the function of the fine arts to provide us with pleasure,
but pleasure of a distinctive kind and quality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#4:1>
Life offers many pleasures that are different in kind and are not here
in question.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#5:1>
The kind of pleasure provided by the fine arts is called aesthetic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#6:1>
The term is not easy to define, and ever since Aristotle,
twentythree centuries ago, attempted to analyse the nature of the
aesthetic experience, philosophers and art critics have continued to debate
about it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#7:1>
Nevertheless, even though we are as far away as ever from
understanding why the arts affect us as they do, the fact is uncontested that
in the presence of objects of art something happens to alter the quality of
our consciousness.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#8:1>
There is a marked intensification of the feeling-element, so marked
on occasion that it may even produce physical reactions, such as the thrill
which runs up the spine, or the inhibiting for a time of all other sensuous
experience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#9:1>
The fine frenzy which possessed the artist at the moment of creation
is in some degree reproduced in the observer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#10:1>
Though the emotive nature of aesthetic experience is a matter of
controversy today, many would concede that the art object does induce an
evocation of the emotional side which our own experience corroborates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#11:1>
Many would agree, in this regard, with what Leo Tolstoy says : </p>
<&> second margin begin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#12:1>
To evoke in oneself a feeling one has experienced, and having
evoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements, lines, colours, sounds, or
forms expressed in words, so as to transmit that feeling that others may
experience the same feeling.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#13:1>
It is the activity of art <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#14:1>
It is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same
feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress towards wellbeing of
individuals and of humanity. <sp> <fnr> 1</fnr> </sp> </p> <&> second margin
end </&> <O> <&> page </&> 16 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#15:1>
Aesthetic pleasure, then, is a function of feeling.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#16:1>
We have under the influence of great art a sensation of living more
abundantly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#17:1>
Some deep-down levels of our personalities, normally quiescent, are
stirred so that we suddenly become more fully aware of ourselves and of the
possibilities that lie in us.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#18:1>
Through art the spirit of man is liberated from a concern with the
practical issues of life, and he stretches his hands towards the ideal.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#19:1>
As susanne K. Langer has rightly pointed out: <quote> " Art is the
surest affidavit that feeling, despite its absolute privacy, repeats itself
in each individual life" </quote> . <sp> <fnr> 2</fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#20:1>
Literature is concerned not only with what is, but how it came to
be what it is, and also with what it is in the process of becoming.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#21:1>
It compares and contrasts, seeks analogies, makes judgments, explores
the significances of things.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#22:1>
There are no regions of experience or speculation into which
literature does not penetrate and gather sustenance for the imagination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#23:1>
Among all the arts, therefore, literature, invading time and
space like a monarch, enjoys the widest franchise and wields the greatest
power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#24:1>
Seeing the end in the beginning and the beginning in the end, it can
move in all directions at once.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#25:1>
It can bid us use our reason to follow a patient analysis of cause
and effect, or it can, in a single flash of imaginative insight, illuminate
the universe for us.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#26:1>
This is the reason why Indian aestheticians argue that art gives us
the privilege which only the gods and angels have: witnessing the artistic
experience without getting personally involved in it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#27:1>
As Ananda Coomaraswamy discussing art in Indian life says <quote> "
<*> dotted line</*> art reflects and answers to <w> man's </w> every need,
whether of affirmation ( <indig> <it> pravritti </indig> </it> ) or denial (
<indig> <it> nivritti </it> </indig> ) being no less for the spectator than
the artist a way ( <indig> <it> marga </it> </indig> ) <*> dotted line</*>"
</quote> . <sp> <fnr> 3</fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#28:1>
Literature is the art which helps each one of us to create for
himself a mental counterpart to the world of sense, a private universe of
thought and feeling in which one may move freely and at ease, and which for
many is far more vivid and palpable than the universe of things. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#29:1>
Literary modes of expression are generally considered to be
cyclical alterations of human attitudes to the environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#30:1>
More often than not, it is forgotten that literature itself is an
education, a refinement of the human mind, interpreting human spirit in terms
of beauty.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#31:1>
Often literary categories are classified as Classicism or
Romanticism, Realism or Naturalism, without realising that these expressions
basically mean a certain kind of <O> <&> page </&> 17 </O> endeavour on the
part of the human spirit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#32:1>
The literary embellishment in which this effort is expressed has a
tendency to erect these categories as selfsufficient entities without any
relation to the basic impulses that give rise to them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#33:1>
Hence we find literary discussion defining terms without realising
that ultimately they imply urges of the mind that are constantly seeking
creative selfexpression at once free and unrestricted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#34:1>
When the Romantic movement began to take shape with the
publication of <it> <mention> The Lyrical Ballads </mention> </it> , ( 1798)
of Wordsworth and Coleridge, it was taken to be a reaction to the 18th
century age of reason.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#35:1>
That it meant the quest for liberty which was denied by the restraint
of reason was hardly comprehended.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#36:1>
In fact, literature has always been a struggle to escape the bondages
under which life labours in its practical preoccupations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#37:1>
It is true that on the level of day-to-day existence the
considerations of practical life have to be paramount.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#38:1>
But man is fundamentally an incarnate isolation, being essentially
separated from others by his corporeal individuality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#39:1>
In realising and asserting this individuality lies the freedom and
authenticity of human existence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#40:1>
Hence the human spirit always breaks out in rebellion against every
form of restraint and tries to be free and uncontrolled.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#41:1>
As we cast a glance at the literary history of the western world, we
realise that literature has always been a quest for liberty in spite of
certain periods during which restraint became the dominant note of literary
creation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#42:1>
The Grecian world was basically an individualistic world in spite
of the city states and the social consciousness that governed it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#43:1>
Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides represent the
individualistic heroism of the Greek mind achieving tragic majesty by defying
every restriction, imposed not only by the society but also by Moira, the
deity of Fate herself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#44:1>
Breaking away from bondage and experiencing the highest reach of
human power in physical or spiritual spheres was the ideal that inspired the
Greek heroes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#45:1>
For them the world was a prize to be conquered by the might of <w>
one's </w> own self by setting at nought the opposing will of even Zeus
himself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#46:1>
This quest of might underwent a radical disintegration, during the
one Hellenistic period, when the pursuit of might turned to pursuit of
pleasure on the one hand and pursuit of ascetic cynicism on the other.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#47:1>
Even this expression of the self was a form of realizing <w> one's
</w> possibilities after having arrived at one ultimate in the heroic
direction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#48:1>
Inevitably the Roman world brought in the Stoic restraint and the
Augustan law and order.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#49:1>
But the Latin literature was also a quest of realizing the
unrestricted integration that the mind is <O> page </&> 18 </O> capable of
restraint for the sake of restraint ends in literature that is without the
vitality of the spirit and turns out to be a kind of preaching or propaganda
that lacks the creative impulse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#50:1>
The Medieval world was essentially restricted in its theological
outlook and as a result gave rise to a Chivalric literature that sought
freedom in heroism and love.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#51:1>
The tension between the Medieval theology and the Chivalric impulse
constitutes one of the major illustrations of the literary urge for freedom
in spite of oppressive social bondage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#52:1>
The Renaissance asserted the right of man for absolute physical
freedom even to the highest tragic extent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#53:1>
<w> Marlowe's </w> plays indicated <w> Tamburlaine's </w> lust for
power, <w> Faustus's </w> lust for knowledge, the Jew of <w> Malta's </w>
lust for splendour and Hero and <w> Leander's </w> lust for passion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#54:1>
Unrestricted outward plunge into space from the earlier theological
confinment marked the Renaissance quest for liberty.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#55:1>
When this external adventure grew sadistic and masochistic, the age
of reason stepped in to control the disintegration and contribute a new
dimension in selfintegration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#56:1>
By accident the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries supported the
rational orientation of integration by discovering a universe characterized
by law and order.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#57:1>
But it was soon realised that the restraint of integration has a
tendency to suppress the impulses and it was no surprise that the Romantic
wave set in with a view to transcending every restriction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#58:1>
Wordsworth, Coleridge and Scott sought a physical orientation by
identifying themselves with the multiplicity of nature the supernatural and
the historically remote.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#59:1>
Byron, Shelley and Keats went still beyond and sought a spiritual
freedom through egoism, mystical love, and pagan identification with the
sensuous and the concrete.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#60:1>
The Romantic age indicated <w> literature's </w> essential character
to seek liberty and found that with the restraining society that was
emerging, literature was never to be at ease in the social practical sphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#61:1>
The literary man began to find himself alienated and an outsider.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-004#62:1>
Since the 19th century, the individual artist has realized that
he is a unique existent and that his genuiness lies not in conformity but in
authentic freedom of experience and expression.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#63:1>
The literature of today is basically turning to extentialism because
of the human <w> spirit's </w> uncompromising quest for freedom.

<ICE-IND:W2B-004#64:1>
It is only when we realize the character of literature as quest for
liberty that we begin to under stand the nature and dimensions of literary
terms. </p> <&> centred </&>
