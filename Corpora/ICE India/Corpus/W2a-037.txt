<ICE-IND:W2A-037#4:1>
<bold> With the influx of industrial revolution coupled with ever
escalating urbanisation, increasing consumerism and population exodus, the
problem of solid wastes has inflated significantly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#5:1>
The paper throws light on various sources of solid wastes and their
implications on health, environment and economy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#6:1>
Besides it also envisages merits and demerits of various solid waste
disposal techniques in the light of the recent literature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#7:1>
The paper concludes with the recommendations and suggestions for a
better menagement of solid wastes. </bold> </p> <&> in two columns </&> <&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#8:1>
Environment is the sum total of all conditions and influences that
affect development and life of organisms ( odum, 1977 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#9:1>
The environment consists of 4 major components : <mention> Lithosphere
</mention> ( the outer mantle of solid earth, that is <w> earth's </w> crust
including soil ) , <mention> atmosphere </mention> ( the protective blanket
of gases surrounding the earth ) , <mention> hydrosphere </mention> ( all
types of water sources, such as oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, etc. ) and
<mention> biosphere </mention> ( the realm of living organisms and their
interactions with environment ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#10:1>
All living species of plants and animals influence their
environment and vice versa.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#11:1>
The extent of such impact is not high in these species.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#12:1>
The reason are many; may it be their balanced population due to
normal checks or their inability to modify the environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#13:1>
However, man interacts exceptionally with nature and can modify the
environment in a variety of ways according to his requirements, knowledge
and values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#14:1>
Ever increasing urbanization, surging population, ramifying
industries, the green revolution and their aftermath have culminated into an
altogether different type of problem termed as the environmental
pollution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#15:1>
Pollution may be described in several ways, for example <mention>
water pollution </mention> , <mention> air pollution </mention> , <mention>
heat or thermal pollution </mention> , <mention> agricultural pollution
</mention> , <mention> noise pollution </mention> , <mention> solid waste
pollution </mention> , etc., which may be natural or man-made, local,
national, international or even planetary engulfing the entire
biosphere.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#16:1>
In the present article pollution from solid waste alongwith the
different aspects of its management are discussed. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#17:1>
<h> <bold> SOLID WASTE POLLUTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#18:1>
Man has been producing the solid wastes during the course of his
normal activities since the beginning of life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#19:1>
At the very minimum these comprise <mention> food wastes </mention> ,
<mention> ashes </mention> , <mention> broken utensils </mention> , <mention>
rags </mention> , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#20:1>
In a small agricultural community nature who has nested and nurtured
us since the time immemorial, readily accepts these wastes into her
natural cycle : animals consume food remains, vegetables, etc., and other
materials are rapidly incorporated into the soil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#21:1>
During early periods, solid wastes were conveniently and
unobtrusively disposed off as the density of population was low with large
open land space.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#22:1>
With the advent of industrialization and urbanization, the problems
of waste disposal increased.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#23:1>
The term <mention> waste </mention> implies that it is of no
concern and is of no use to anyone.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#24:1>
It is a problem precisely because it is a material that is not wanted
by the producers or consumers who, of course, seek to dispose off it at the
lowest possible cost.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#25:1>
<mention> Solid waste </mention> can be defined as any unwanted
material, that is not discharged to the atmosphere or via a pipe.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#26:1>
It is a term now used internationally to describe <mention>
non-liquid wastes from domestic, trade, commercial, industrial,
agricultural </mention> , and from the <mention> public services
</mention> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#27:1>
<h> <bold> SOURCES, CHARACTERISTICS AND CLASSIFICATION OF
<mention> SOLID WASTES </mention> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#28:1>
<mention> Solid wastes </mention> come from a wide variety of
sources and different types are the responsibilities of different
agencies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#29:1>
These comprise countless different materials : <mention> Dust
</mention> , <mention> food wastes </mention> , <mention> packing in the form
of paper </mention> , <mention> metals </mention> , <mention> glass
</mention> , <mention> wornout clothings </mention> and <mention>
furnitures </mention> , <mention> garden wastes </mention> formed due to
<mention> construction </mention> and <mention> demolition processes
</mention> , <mention> dead bodies of animals and plants </mention> ,
<mention> pathological wastes </mention> , <mention> hazardous wastes
</mention> , <mention> radioactive wastes </mention> ( also known as royal
wastes ) and <mention> agricultural wastes </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#30:1>
A flow diagram of the materials and solid waste generation in our
technological society is presented in figure 1 ( Tchobanoglous <O> <&>
page </&> 669 </O> <O> Table 1 & 2 </O> <O> captions </O> <it> et al., </it>
1977 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#31:1>
Refuse characteristics have been known to vary depending upon the
degree of industrialization, standary of living and <}> <-> dietry </->
<+> dietary </+> </}> habits of the community.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#32:1>
International variations are caused by a variety of factors,
including wealth, literacy and work habits.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#33:1>
The differences are often very great.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#34:1>
Residents of large towns seem to throw away more than people in small
towns.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#35:1>
The general rule is that as one goes from a small, poor, traditional
and illiterate community to a large, rich, moderate and literate one,
the refuse weight increases the density decreases ( and, therefore, the
volume increases ) , the <mention> food preparation waste </mention> also
reduces, the <mention> paper and packing fraction </mention> increases and
average particle <O> figure 1. </O> <O> caption </O> size increases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#36:1>
However, these trends do not always hold true ( Coad, 1973 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#37:1>
A knowledge of physicochemical characteristics in imperative for
the selection of proper disposal methods.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#38:1>
Some important characteristics of the <mention> solid wastes
</mention> are given in table </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#39:1>
1. A typical classification of solid wastes has been given by Rogus (
1964) :

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#40:1>
Garbage - - <mention> Putrescible ( decomposable ) wastes </mention>
from <mention> food </mention> , <mention> slaughterhouse </mention> ,
<mention> canning and freezing industries </mention> , and other sources.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#41:1>
2. <mention> Rubbish - - Nonputrescible wastes </mention> , either
combustible or noncombustible.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#42:1>
<mention> Combustible wastes </mention> include <mention> paper
</mention> , <mention> wood </mention> , <mention> cloth </mention> ,
<mention> rubber </mention> , <mention> leather </mention> , and <mention>
garden wastes </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#43:1>
<mention> Noncombustibles </mention> include <mention> metals
</mention> , <mention> glass </mention> , <mention> ceramics </mention> ,
<mention> stones </mention> , <mention> dirt </mention> , <mention> masonry
</mention> , and <mention> some chemicals </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#44:1>
3. Ashes - - <mention> Residues </mention> ( such as cinders and
flyash ) of the combustion of solid fuels for heating and cooking or the
incineration of solid wastes by municipal, industrial, and apartment hosue
incinerators.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#45:1>
4. Large wastes - - <mention> Demolition and construction rubble
</mention> ( pipes, lumber, masonry, brick, plastic, roofing and insulating
materials ) , <mention> automobiles </mention> , <mention> furniture
</mention> , <mention> refrigerators </mention> and other home appliances,
<mention> trees </mention> , <mention> tires </mention> , and other iterms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#46:1>
5. Dead animals - - <mention> Household pets </mention> , <mention>
birds </mention> , <mention> rodents </mention> , <mention> zoo animals
</mention> and others.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#47:1>
There are also <mention> anatomical and pathological wastes
</mention> from hospitals. <O> <&> page </&> 670 </O> <O> figure 2 & 3 </O>
<O> captions </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#48:1>
6. <mention> Sewage treatment process solids </mention> - - <mention>
Screenings </mention> , <mention> settled solids </mention> , <mention>
sludge </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#49:1>
7. <mention> Industrial solid wastes </mention> - - <mention>
Chemicals </mention> , <mention> paints </mention> , <mention> sand
</mention> , <mention> explosives </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#50:1>
8. <mention> Mining wastes </mention> - - <mention> <quote> `
Tailings' </quote> </mention> , <mention> slag heaps </mention> , <mention>
culm piles </mention> at coal mines.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#51:1>
9. <mention> Agricultural wastes </mention> - - <mention> Farm animal
manure </mention> , <mention> crop residues </mention> , and others.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#52:1>
<h> <bold> ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#53:1>
The most obvious environmental damage caused by <mention> solid
wastes </mention> is aesthetics :

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#54:1>
The ugliness of street litter and the destruction of the beauty of
countryside by improper dumping of city wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#55:1>
However, the crux of solid waste problem which often goes unheeded
lines in the leachates.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#56:1>
The <mention> leachate </mention> is the liquid that has travelled
solid wastes or other medium and has extracted, dissolved or suspended
material from it ( ISI, 1981 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#57:1>
The <mention> leachates </mention> are known to infiltrate through
the layers of soil beneath and contaminate the groundwater sources deep
down to infiltrate through the layers of soil beneath and contaminate the
groundwater sources deep down ( Heghes <it> et al., </it> 1971; Dayal <it>
et al., </it> 1991 ) as depicted in figure 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#58:1>
The leachates from dumping sites or disposal tanks of sewage mixed
industrial effluents and wastes are more harmful as they contain organic
compounds, like carcinogenic hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, etc., and
chlorinated hydrocarbons all of which are highly poisoneous.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#59:1>
Run off from dump-site may deteriorate surface water quality as
illustrated in figure 3 ( Horvath, 1984; Borden and Yanoschak, 1990 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#60:1>
Air pollution may also be caused from the inefficient burning of
wastes, either in the open air or in plants that lack effective
treatment facilities for the gaseous effluents ( Berlincioni and Di Domenico,
1986 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#61:1>
<h> <bold> HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#62:1>
There are potential risks to health from wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#63:1>
They <O> <&> page </&> 671 </O> <O> figure 4. </O> <O> caption </O>
can cause public health problems indirectly by encouraging the growth of
population of flies ( which can transmit fever, cholera, dysentry,
tuberculosis, anthrax, etc. ) , rats ( which can spread plague, murine
typhus fever, leptospirosis, rabies, rickettsiaplox, etc. ) , cockroaches,
mosquitoes ( which can cause malaria, yellow fever, dengue, mosquito - -
borne encephalitis, filariasis, etc. ) , and other pests.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#64:1>
Workers involved in collection and disposal of solid wastes are
directly subjected to health hazards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#65:1>
A study in India found a higher incidences of intestinal parasites
in collectars of domestic wastes than in the population as a whole (
Arceivala, 1971 ) , glass, jagged metal and razor blades cause cuts
which may become infected or lead to tetanus.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#66:1>
They are also prone to sprains and back disorders because of heavy
lifting their job requires.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#67:1>
Traffic accidents are another hazard because of the frequent need
to cross the road ( NSC, 1971 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#68:1>
Respiratory disease is a possible consequence of inhaling dust
from refuse and street sweeping, especially where spitting is common. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#69:1>
<h> <bold> GENERATION OF SOLID WASTES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#70:1>
As everyday passed the garbage in the street corner bin spilled
over sooner that it could be emptied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#71:1>
For instance, in USA each sun sets sees a new mountain to be
precise 4,10,000 tonne of solid wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#72:1>
New York itself throws out 25,000 tonne of solid stink when none of
the <w> city's </w> 14 landfills in use for more than 25 year, can take any
more.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#73:1>
The amount of solid wastes produced in Canada during 1970 would be
sufficient to build a 4 lane highway raised three feet above ground level
stretching from Toranto to Vancouver.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#74:1>
In our town backyard, Delhi city collects about 3,000 tonne of
garbage from its streets everyday, to be thrown into its 5 landfills.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#75:1>
The people of Kanpur city everyday discharge 1800 m<sp>3</sp> ( 900
tonne) of solid wastes and 1700 m<sp>3</sp> of night soil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#76:1>
In India, the per capita production of solid wastes is about 0.35
kg / day in urban settlements and about 0.20 kg / day in rural areas.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#77:1>
On the contrary, U.S. population discards 2.50 kg / day / head of
solid wastes, Canada 1.64 day / head and U.K. 1.0 kg / day / head.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#78:1>
In some other countries the solid waste production rates are given in
table 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#79:1>
Increased commercial and industrial activities have, however,
resulted into an increased release of wastes are known to increase per capita
waste generation as well.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#80:1>
It is repoted that an increase of 1.5 % per <O> <&> page </&> 672
</O> annum occurs in U.S.A.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#81:1>
( Tchobanoglous <it> et al., </it> 1977) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#82:1>
Nagur based CPHERI ( now known as NEE RI ) observations during
1969-70 in Calcutta showed a per capita increase of 1.33 % per year ( N
EERI, 1973 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#83:1>
In developing countries, like Hongkong, the per capita generation
rate was 0.73 kg / day which was expercted to go upto 1.33 kg / head / day in
1986 indicating an increase of 6.08 % / per year. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#84:1>
<h> <bold> ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#85:1>
Municipal agencies spend 20 to 40 % of their annual budget on
solid waste management in the developing countries ( Cointreau, 1982 ) and
on average 10 % in India ( NEERI, 1973 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#86:1>
Labour and transport absorb 65 % of the operating costs of solid
waste management programmes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#87:1>
It is common for a city to employ between 2 and 5 workers for each
1000 population.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#88:1>
Three workers 1000 population may represent 1 % of the total
national work force.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#89:1>
Transport is required on a scale of about 1 heavy vehicle / 15,000
population.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#90:1>
Thus solid waste management schemes can absorb upto 1 % of the gross
national product ( GNP ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#91:1>
<h> <bold> SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#92:1>
Solid waste management may be defined as that discipline
associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and
transport, process ing, and disposal of solid waste in the proper manner,
that is in accordance with the suitable measures for general sanitation,
economics, engineering, conservation, aesthetics, and other environmental
considerations, as well as responsible to public attitude.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#93:1>
In the management, the collection and transport are the important
factors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#94:1>
The collection work should be carried out under the supervision of
properly trained staff to obtain the desired results.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#95:1>
The success of any collection system depends mainly on the proper
selection of the collecting equipments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#96:1>
To develop the proper collection system the following factors must
be considered : ( 1)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#97:1>
Population and area of the solid waste collection, ( 2)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#98:1>
Topography or configuration of collection area, ( 3)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#99:1>
Climatic factors, such as rain fall, wind speed, temperature;
and height from the sea level, etc., ( 4)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#100:1>
Characteristics and qualities of waste product of collecting
area, ( 5)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#101:1>
Types of collecting equipments and availability of modern
equipments, ( 6)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#102:1>
Rate of collection by the staff members and ( 7)

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#103:1>
Implementation of rules and regulations. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#104:1>
<h> <bold> CURRENT PRACTICES OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-037#105:1>
One of the easiest ways to get rid of <mention> solid wastes
</mention> is to dump them simply in a land untitled and inhabitated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#106:1>
However, dwindling land resources have checked this tendency.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#107:1>
For proper disposal of these wastes, scientists have evolved various
methods, like incineration, composting, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#108:1>
However, no single menagement option can serve as a panacea for
our waste problems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#109:1>
Hence, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency encourages
municipalities to use a mix of solutions to handle solid wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#110:1>
( EPA, 19 89a, 1989b ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#111:1>
Within the range of management options, <mention> EPA </mention>
suggests a hierarchy for decision makers to consider when planning and
implementing integrated solid waste management.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#112:1>
The first level of hierarchy is source reduction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#113:1>
Recycling, including the composting, is the second level of
hierarchy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#114:1>
Finally in <w> <mention> EPA's </mention> </w> hierarchy comes waste
combustion ( incineration ) and landfilling.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#115:1>
Landfilling is the only true disposal method.

<ICE-IND:W2A-037#116:1>
It is a necessary component of waste management since all
management options produce some residue that must be disposed off
through landfilling. </p> </I>
