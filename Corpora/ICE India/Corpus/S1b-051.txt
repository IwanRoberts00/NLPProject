<ICE-IND:S1B-051#1:1:A>
Chairman sir <,,> when we go through the budget <,,> apparently
<,,> it will exceed to just <,,> the budget <,,> with the duties set upto
four thousand five hundred twenty-two <indig> crores rupees </indig> capitals
and excise <,,> and <,,> no further taxes levied <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#2:1:A>
The Central Plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#3:1:A>
When we show all these things and expecting <,> our <O> one word
</O> be close by four point five percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#4:1:A>
It seems to be <,,> kept bold and imaginative budget <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#5:1:A>
But what is the real <,,> scenario of the budget <,> we have to go
through little bit deeper

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#6:1:A>
They are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the
employment <,,> that can be created what they feel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#7:1:A>
But for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three <,,> when we go through
the reality <,,> the first six months <,,> where <,> we are able to create
only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment <&> interruption
</&> outside <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#8:1:A>
That means <,,> now <,> what we envisage to create only twenty-five
percent of that <,,> man-days <,> we are able to create in the last <,,> last
year last six months of the budget year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#9:1:A>
I want to know from the government <,,> what infrastructure has been
created to fulfill <,,> this <w> year's </w> target <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#10:1:A>
Sir <,,> while we say <,,> that for Central plan outlay has been
increased by thirty-two percent <,,> we must also <,,> go through with the
subsidy issue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#11:1:A>
Sir according to subsidy <,,> whatever <,,> finance is assigned
<,,> I want to quote <,,> financial resource <,,> if I have gone to create
the I C O <,> if I have gone the same way <,> as the last year <,> the
fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to <indig> rupees </indig> eleven
thousand <indig> crores </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#12:1:A>
Because of the action taken in the last two years <,> the
fertiliser subsidy <,> could be only <indig> rupees </indig> three thousand
five hundred <indig> crores </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#13:1:A>
From this you can find out sir <,,> more than seven thousand five
hundred <indig> crores </indig> <,,> has been put on the <w> farmer's </w>
shoulder already <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#14:1:A>
When we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is
something <,> wrong policy

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#15:1:A>
No <,> what is called subsidy <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#16:1:A>
Subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of
the society to another section of the society <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#17:1:A>
Suppose for example if I tell <,> if you want to stop the entire
subsidy for fertilizers <,> and if you wanted to <,> take up all the
concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff <,> the electricity
tariff <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#18:1:A>
Then <,> suppose the production of the agriculture comes down <,>
then we may have to take <,> the grants from the foreign countries like <,>
States or European countries <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#19:1:A>
For example <,> what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is
approximately <w> I'm </w> telling <,> for three hundred and fifty <indig>
rupees </indig> <,> what it pays to our Indian farmer <,> the same rate we
may have to import from the American farmers <,> as five hundred and fifty
<indig> rupees </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#20:1:A>
Two hundred <indig> rupees </indig> <,> we have to pay more <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#21:1:A>
Instead of that what I say is instead of paying to the American
farmer <,> why should not we give to our own Indian farmers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#22:1:A>
What is wrong in giving subsidy <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#23:1:A>
Sir <,> regarding the subsidies I wanted to tell <,> that share of
the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the Seventh Plan period <,>
approximately this is sixteen percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#24:1:A>
Now <,> this side <,> share of the subsidies in the non-plan
expenditure during this year <,> it is reduced <,> eight point seven percent

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#25:1:A>
They think <,> that subsequent reduce in the subsidy <,> they are
actually pleasing the <O> one word </O> a body of the world bank <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#26:1:A>
This is not good for the common people in <-> the </-> India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#27:1:A>
Sir regarding the interest payment <,> I want to tell sir the
interest payment <,> is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#28:1:A>
Now <,> it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#29:1:A>
But in the Seventh Plan average it was only twenty-seven percent
sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#30:1:A>
Then personal income tax exemption <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#31:1:A>
The income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one <,> it was fifty
<indig> rupees </indig> fifteen thousand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#32:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand <,> in nineteen
ninety it was twenty-two thousand <,> nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight
thousand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#33:1:A>
Sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand
<indig> rupees </indig> exemption into that system sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#34:1:A>
Now it is <,> the value of that fifteen thousand <indig> rupees
</indig> now it is said about forty thousand <indig> rupees </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#35:1:A>
What I wanted to emphasize through you sir <,,> in Australia
different method is applied <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#36:1:A>
In Australia what they did Australia <O> one word </O> according to
Australian <O> one word </O> <,> first they fixed the base or base amount <,>
that is their triparty <O> two words </O> that government <,> employers
employees <,> all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken
as a base year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#37:1:A>
From that base year <,> when <w> one's </w> accepted exemption
amount <,> that every year what is actually inflation takes place in
Australia <,> they have according to that percentage <,> the exempted limit
also keep being enhanced

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#38:1:A>
Sir <,> through you what I wanted to <,> emphasize to the
government of India <,> that please atleast now you replace that <,> nineteen
eighty-one you please take it as a base year <,> fifteen thousand <indig>
rupees </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#39:1:A>
After that every year how much deflation takes place in India <,>
so far taken in India <,> you please translate it <,> that this inflation <,>
after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one
scientific way

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#40:1:A>
Sir regarding unique system of India <,> the investment is so far
<,> it attracts the eight to eighty of <O> one word </O> <,> so far

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#41:1:A>
But now <,> it has been given up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#42:1:A>
Our honourable Finance Minister says <,> we have today equal
treatment with other financial institution we are <?> dealing </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#43:1:A>
But <,> for this <,> one gentlemen <,> what the economy <,> they
have given the proper replace for that

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#44:1:A>
Objectively <,> the Finance Minister has taken this step <,> so as
to put the U T I or bond with other mutual fund

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#45:1:A>
However <,> if that was the only reason <,> surely <,> his <?> left
technical </?> method would have been the extensive <O> a few words </O>
benefits to other mutual funds <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#46:1:A>
Instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the U T
I <,> they would have experienced the same benefit the other mutual funds <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#47:1:A>
Then sir <,> when you object actually enhance the prices <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#48:1:A>
<w> You're </w> doing not only the <,> interest <O> one word </O>
<,> not only <,> in the tax <O> one word </O> <,> but the administrative
prices

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#49:1:A>
For example I tell you <,> before announcing the budget <,>
pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#50:1:A>
You have enhanced the price for sugar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#51:1:A>
You have enhanced the price <,> for actually the <w> rice's </w>
price increased <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#52:1:A>
The actual price increased <,> gold price increased <,> that the
prices of the coal <,> prices of the sugar <,> price of rice <,> price of the
<,> then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor
therefore <,,> what I request the government <,> that government should what
they they have shown <,> what they have printed <,> what they have said is
totally different from <,> what they are doing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#53:1:A>
What is their real intention <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#54:1:A>
Therefore <,> I wanted to <,> I want I request you truly sir <,>
that please bring in practice <,> that the <O> one word </O> be the
government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#55:1:A>
With these words I conclude

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#56:1:A>
Thank you <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-051#57:1:B>
<O> One or two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#58:1:B>
From the last two years <,> we successfully withdrew money from the
<O> one word </O> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#X59:1:B>
<O> A few words </O> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-051#60:1:B>
And thereby <,,> about thirty-two thousand <indig> crores
</indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> has been withdrawn from the market <{>
<[> and <,> thirty-two thousand <indig> crores </indig> of <indig> rupees
</indig> has been invested in the financial market </[> <,> in the share
market <,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#X61:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{> </X> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#X62:1:B>
<O> A few words </O> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-051#63:1:B>
Therefore within last year <,> <{> <[> Shivaji <,> when we
proposed the budget <,,> and uh due to the <O> a few words </O> lot more
concessions were announced <,> for the industrial set-up <,> than the capital
market <,> <X> <[> Shivaji </[> </{> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-051#64:1:B>
Then we we <,> then the entire nation <,> witnessed the goings
<,> in regards to the scam <,> scandal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#65:1:B>
The hopes were raised <,> among many people including the rural
folk <,> to invest in the industrial sector <,> and thereby <,> lot more
money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector <,> and from
rural area to urban area <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#66:1:B>
I will also budget <,> when we budget at the budget <,> there was
no hike in the <,> tax component <,> and uh <,> additional component was not
enhanced <,> nor the <,> custom duties <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#67:1:B>
But at the same time <,> they gave certain relief to other sectors
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#68:1:B>
And he said <,> that everything is going to be cosy <,> but he
can't lend us <,> we analyse the figures <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#69:1:B>
Here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty
thousand <indig> crores </indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> <,> from capital
account <,> to revenue account <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#70:1:B>
And so <,,> then once money is transferred from capital account to
revenue account <,> all your balance expenditure will be cut <,> and all your
<}> <-> development </-> <=> developmental </=> </}> activities <,> will be
affected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#71:1:B>
And we are witnessing <-> in this </- > in this country <,> that
every developmental activities is cancelled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#72:1:B>
No construction of roads <,> no construction of bridges for
industry <,> and no allocation <,> or any land allocation in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#73:1:B>
As the Finance Minister day-in and day-out <,,> he talks much about
the so called liberalisation <,> and <,> the so called delicensing policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#74:1:B>
But this delicensing policy <,> is yet to touch the agricultural
sector <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#75:1:B>
And several <,> manufactured goods <,> and several consumer goods
<,> includes the motor cars refrigerators as well as the <,,> <O> one word
</O> <,> and washing machines <,> are under the delicensing policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#76:1:B>
As far as exemption is concerned <,> than the so called delicensing
proposal <,> and so called liberalisation <,> it is hardly that it is
changing the attitude <O> a few words </O> in the agriculture sector <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#77:1:B>
For example you take the example of the <,> sugar industry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#78:1:B>
Then all of our industries are related to <,> sugar industry <,> is
kept <,> with the <,> ministry of industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#79:1:B>
In Andra Pradesh <,> about ninety-two applications were received by
the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#80:1:B>
And the application was forwarded to the Union Government <,> to
the minister of sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh <,> with an install
capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day <,> and with an
investment of <,> not less than forty <indig> crores </indig> on each unit
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#81:1:B>
And the larger units are allowed <,> four thousand <indig> crores
</indig> of <,> investment has been pumped into circulation <,> as far as the
sugar-cane industry is concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#82:1:B>
Then you take the example of the dairy industry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#83:1:B>
When the government in their own <O> one word </O> <,> they have
given us into dairy industry also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#84:1:B>
So <,> there are about six fifty people applied for <,> to go for
dairy industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#85:1:B>
Many people <,> like both domestic as well as the multinational
they came forward <,> to go for the dairy industry <,> as there is potential
in this country also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#86:1:B>
But I was made to understand <,> that Mr Balram Jakhar <,> he came
in the way <,> and he wanted to bring same other <,> <indig> Narad </indig>
<,> through back door <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#87:1:B>
So <,> Mr Balram Jakhar <,> announced through his animal husbundry
department of the ministry of <,> agriculture <,> an offer by then <,> milk
and milk products are to the N F N F D O <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#88:1:B>
So <,> if anybody wants to go for dairy <,> with an install
capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day <,> then entirely he has to
get his name registered <,> and we get registering form from the agriculture
department <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#89:1:B>
It is challenged in the court of law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#90:1:B>
So for the last two years <,> instead of the liberalisation in the
dairy industry <,> <O> two words </O> applications are pending with the Union
government for want of the registration with delay <,> Ministry of
Agriculture headed by Mr Balram Jakhar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#91:1:B>
I take another example <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#92:1:B>
For example <,> the second biggest monopoly in the world <,> the R
K Reynolds Company <,> they approached this government to allow them <,> to
produce cigerettes in this country <,> and they ensured the nation <,> to <,>
to the extent <,> that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric
tons of sugar <,> metric tons of tobacco in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#93:1:B>
And not only that <,> they ensured <,> to export <,> about one
forty <indig> crores </indig> of <,> cigarettes <,> to the other countries
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#94:1:B>
And they also ensured <,> that about six hundred <indig> crores
</indig> of revenue <,> they will contribute in the form of excise on this
cigerette <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#95:1:B>
But their proposal was was also <,> turned down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#96:1:B>
I visited <O> one word </O> to the minister of Commerce <,> and the
minister told me <,> that <,> as the deputy chairman of the planning
commission <,> he vetoed it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#97:1:B>
Since the last forty-five years <,> this is the only year <,> when
there is no hike <,> and the excise component <,> on the Cigarette <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#98:1:B>
But the answer to this <,,> the cigarette manufacturers <,> in
their own wisdom <,> during last January February <,> as they rotate <,> they
enhanced the prices of the cigarette <,> then anticipating some enhancement
some hike in the excise components <,> on the cigarette in the budget
proposal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#99:1:B>
But to their fortune <,> there was no increase in the excise
component <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#100:1:B>
Thereby <,> the cigarette manufacturers drawn an opportunity <,>
to garner three hundred <indig> crores </indig> of <indig> rupees </indig>
<,> which did not circulate to the government in the form of the revenue <,>
and <,> nor to the <,,> tobacco grower <,> for in the form of the price of
the tobacco <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#101:1:B>
Add to this <O> two words </O> the prices of the tobacco <,> are
going down when compared to the last two three years

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#102:1:B>
So <,> we suggested to the government <,> to impose a levy of one
percent <,> on the sale of the cigarette <,> and which money <,> which amount
<,> can be utilised <,> as a market stabilising fund for the tobacco <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#103:1:B>
And I hope <,> the government will come out <,> and the Finance
Minister will come out <,> while answering <,> these <,,> by answering <,>
the Finance Bill <,> and see <,> that the one percent is <,,> imposed on the
sale of the cigarette <,> and that money can be utilised as a market
stabilising fund

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#104:1:B>
So <,> I hope <,> that the finance minister will come out with the
proposal <,> while answering these <,> <}> <-> <.> fi </.> </-> <=> financing
</=> </}> it

<ICE-IND:S1B-051#105:1:B>
Thank you <,,> </I>
