<ICE-IND:S2A-042#1:1:A>
I think you know something about <mention> credit cards  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#2:1:A>
The way in which a <mention> credit <}> <-> cards </-> <+> card </+>  
</}> </mention> is issued to customer <,,> and the means in which you can use  
the <mention> credit card </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#3:1:A>
Basically a <mention> credit card </mention> is an unsecured loan  
<,> given by any bank or financial institution <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#4:1:A>
When a bank is going to issue a <mention> credit card </mention> we  
say they have a strong <,> certain capital base <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#5:1:A>
We or <w> bank's </w> fundemental aspects behind which a <mention>  
credit card </mention> company runs <,,> is the requirement of working  
capital <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#6:1:A>
So <,> banks can draft the fund from other departments <,> and uh  
<,> <w> that's </w> how <,> issuing this <mention> credit card </mention>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#7:1:A>
Let me tell you about the proper method <mention> credit card  
</mention> is issued <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#8:1:A>
See basically <,> as I told tell you <w> it's </w> an unsecured loan  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#9:1:A>
We don't require any <,> uh what do you call as deposit <,,> or any  
advances against issue of <mention> credit card </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#10:1:A>
All the customer has to do is to give some documents <,> proving  
his income <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#11:1:A>
And we have certain criteria for procurement of uh <,> issuing that  
<mention> credit cards </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#12:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> suppose <w> it's </w> a salaried <,> customer <,,>  
he had to have a minimum <,> gross salary of fifty thousand <,> per annum  
<,,> and thirty-six thousand per month <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#13:1:A>
So this is for <mention> master card </mention> and <mention> visa  
card </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#14:1:A>
We also have another card called the <mention> diners club card  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#15:1:A>
So the premium have a value card <,> <w> it's </w> about uh <,> if  
it is a salaried guy <,> he had to have an income of fifty thousand <,> that  
is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#16:1:A>
So these are <,,> basically two views one is the verification view  
<,> and other is judgemental view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#17:1:A>
Who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity  
of the customer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#18:1:A>
He might <,,> for all you know he might <-> going to </-> be your  
credit runner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#19:1:A>
So the person you have to pick is that <,> that are really  
executives <,,> whether he is really capable of holding <mention> credit  
cards </mention> <,> because the banks stake is involved in it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#20:1:A>
And we have cases of <O> two words </O> worth <indig> lakhs  
</indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#21:1:A>
So the first thing that we require for that guy <,> is to <,>  
fulfill our income criteria <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#22:1:A>
If he fulfills that <,,> we have to fix some verification criteria  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#23:1:A>
So <,,> the first thing that we do is clear application <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#24:1:A>
We have what you call as direct sales agent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#25:1:A>
So these guys go and get application <,> from a major company <,>  
and uh big shop partnerships and all that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#26:1:A>
So as soon as they <,> clear applications and get them signed with  
all the documents <,> they are submitted to a <,> certified public accountant  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#27:1:A>
He may call us metro city 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#28:1:A>
They submit all app <,> or the application to the metro city <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#29:1:A>
And the metro city gives them to <,> uh C P I in Madras, whom we  
call as a noddle certified public accountant <,> and uh that noddle <,>  
certified public accountant <,> verifies after the completing of the  
application <,> whether they have fulfill the criteria manually <,> and uh  
data enters them onto the computers which are in the system <,> and at the  
end of the day <,> he takes down them as a dbase file <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#30:1:A>
And at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem <,> to  
Trivandrum <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#31:1:A>
And everyday evening <,> this transmission gets <,> into progress 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#32:1:A>
And after this gets downloaded into citibank systems <,> we have to  
convert it into our database <,> and we have to issue the database upto work  
table <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#33:1:A>
So we have to run certain programmes <,> they are called odi  
programmes or what you call end of the programme <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#34:1:A>
After all these programmes are run <,> these database downloaded  
into our system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#35:1:A>
And next day morning they will be available for verification <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#36:1:A>
So the datas here <,> and the application will come <-> in </-> the  
next day morning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#37:1:A>
As soon as they come <,> we have a process of what is called as  
moving an application to an approval stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#38:1:A>
We have a different stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#39:1:A>
Suppose uh <,> uh applicant doesn't <}> <-> given </-> <+> give  
</+> </}> his date of birth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#40:1:A>
It is a mandatory field 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#41:1:A>
We have certain mandatory field 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#42:1:A>
Suppose if he has not given his address <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#43:1:A>
Suppose if he has not given his date of birth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#44:1:A>
If you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory  
field which are compulsory for any application <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#45:1:A>
So everyday a programme is run <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#46:1:A>
And uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are  
not fulfilled <,> it throws them into a certain station <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#47:1:A>
Okay 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#48:1:A>
And uh <,> if this <,> check is fulfilled it moves to another stage  
<,> where you call a credit scoring programme as such 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#49:1:A>
Based on the age of the applicant <,> on his financial status <,>  
on his uh <,> assets worth <,> on the type of vehicle he <}> <-> own </-> <+>  
owns </+> </}> there were funny <,> fundemental tid bits <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#50:1:A>
And taking <,> all these into account a certain score is assigned  
to a customer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#51:1:A>
Suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#52:1:A>
And uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another <,,> stage  
called a de-duplicative stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#53:1:A>
So all you know <,> a customer might apply once again he may be  
already having a card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#54:1:A>
And uh <,,> he might apply once again to get another card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#55:1:A>
And there might be a chance of fraud <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#56:1:A>
So to rule out these <,> cases <,> cases of fraud we have certain  
programmes what is called as de-duplication programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#57:1:A>
We have a database of around four <indig> lakh </indig> fifty  
thousand members <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#58:1:A>
Around two <indig> lakh </indig> members and one <indig> lakh  
</indig> fifty thousand applicant <,> plus some one <indig> lakh </indig> in  
our work table <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#59:1:A>
So our <,,> database or <,,> or what you call <,,> uh <,,> members  
<,> addresses and all these <,> are totally on birthday base <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#60:1:A>
So <w> let's </w> say these data <,> gets matched against any of  
these <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#61:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> say date of birth or address or anything <,> <-> it  
is </-> <,> it goes to a certain status <,> and any officer concerned has to  
look into it <,> why why is it that <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#62:1:A>
For all you know <,,> me and my friend could have a same date of  
birth <,> but we are different persons <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#63:1:A>
So we have to look uh this is same person <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#64:1:A>
And suppose these are different he has to <}> <-> clearly </-> <+>  
clear </+> </}> <,,> uhm <,> de-duplication programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#65:1:A>
And after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#66:1:A>
Okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about  
<,,> the verification of the application towards its <,> completeness <,>  
towards the income criteria and certain how it <}> <-> consist criterias </->  
<+> consists of criteria </+> </}> which I mean the <mention> credit card  
</mention> man may subcribe <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#67:1:A>
So we have to look for all these <,> things <,> and suppose if it  
is fulfilled we move to a different status <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#68:1:A>
And then two parallel process go on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#69:1:A>
One is the fiscal reputaion criteria <,> and the other one is the  
bank verification criteria <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#70:1:A>
Suppose uh <,> for certain <,> categories of applicant we have  
different categories of <,,> verification based on their <,> deliquency and  
their past performance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#71:1:A>
We have a <,,> we have taken a from <,> how these <,> portfolio  
perform <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#72:1:A>
And based on their performance of these portfolio <,> we have  
induced a certain verification criteria <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#73:1:A>
So suppose <,> uh <w> let's </w> say if it is salaried person we  
have to perform our own verification <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#74:1:A>
Suppose <,> if you contact in a public limited company <,> here the  
credit runner is much less you know public limited company 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#75:1:A>
We have to <,> check for the person <,> has he really applied for a  
card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#76:1:A>
You see the person who has really applied for the card <,> and  
certain checks over it 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#77:1:A>
We have to check about <O> a few words </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#78:1:A>
Yeah he may cross that stage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#79:1:A>
And then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#80:1:A>
So this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether <,>  
he has any bounce cheques <,> what is his nominal balance <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#81:1:A>
So this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform  
on your account <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#82:1:A>
So after this has proved <,,> being pushed the application get  
certain status <,> and after all this is <,> done we issue a card <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#83:1:A>
As soon as the card is issued <,> based on the source of  
accumulation the billing is done <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#84:1:A>
<-> The </- > there are <,> five different types of clause of  
acquisition <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#85:1:A>
One is the direct sales agency <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#86:1:A>
The other one has got a <?> cross road </?> application <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#87:1:A>
Suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a  
<,> visa card or master card across <,,> the <,> billing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#88:1:A>
Or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application <,> he  
is into the <?> cross road </?> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#89:1:A>
The third one is take on <,> take on <,> and there customers have  
been short finale <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#90:1:A>
So he all <,> the customer has to do is come and pick up the  
application <,> fill up all this <,> and if he fulfills the criteria he is  
given the card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#91:1:A>
And there are two three other ways in which a card is issued 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#92:1:A>
So these are the <,,> different ways in which application is closed  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#93:1:A>
So based on the source of application the billing is different <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#94:1:A>
So as soon as these are entered <,> a card is endorsed <}> <-> at  
</-> <+> on </+> </}> the third day <,> as soon as application is approved  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#95:1:A>
So <,,> as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on  
a second day <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#96:1:A>
Lately by third day the card get endorsed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#97:1:A>
The next day <,> the card reaches the customer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#98:1:A>
And if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the  
automatic teller-machine or anytime money A T M <,> he has to get the card  
encoded <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#99:1:A>
There is a certain <,,> uhm personal <,,> identification number  
which you give to a customer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#100:1:A>
Only that customer holds that number and <.> on </.> then only he  
uses that number in the A T M he can withdraw money from that A T M <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#101:1:A>
So <,> he has to get the card encoded in the A T M <,> and then  
you can use the <}> <-> <.> car </.> </-> <=> card </=> </}> for cash  
withdrawl <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#102:1:A>
For purchases <,> a customer need not get his card encoded <,> he  
can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#103:1:A>
Those are called member establishment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#104:1:A>
So here he just walk over to a shop <,> buy anything and then  
charge his card against it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#105:1:A>
We have what you call as charge list <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#106:1:A>
Suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products <,,> okay 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#107:1:A>
And uh <,> he has to submit the card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#108:1:A>
We have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based  
on their performances and their deliquencies <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#109:1:A>
So <w> let's </w> say <,> a jewellery shop is a high risk area  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#110:1:A>
So every <,> charge that is booked in a jewellery shop <,> should  
be authorised by city bank <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#111:1:A>
So every time a charge come to a jewellery shop <,,> the <,>  
member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code  
which is an online real time system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#112:1:A>
So certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#113:1:A>
So suppose the card number is data entered in that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#114:1:A>
It immediately looks for customers account <,> its credit open to  
buy <,> and how much is the credit line and how much has he utilised it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#115:1:A>
And there are certain checks towards it <}> <-> <.> wh </.> </->  
<=> whether </=> </}> he has any bounce cheques in his account <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#116:1:A>
So it looks for very synthetic field <,> and that either approves  
it <,> or reject it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#117:1:A>
If it is a <,> if <,> it is approved <,> or certain code is  
generated <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#118:1:A>
And the the code is given to the member establishment 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#119:1:A>
He has to write it down on that stamp slip <,> on his copy 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#120:1:A>
There are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the  
city bank and one to member <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#121:1:A>
So <,,> he has to write the <,> authorisation code on that card  
state bank submitted to city bank <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#122:1:A>
I mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be  
valid <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#123:1:A>
Only in case of flow limit higher than <,,> what a fixed deposit  
has given <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#124:1:A>
In case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank  
he will not take an authorisation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#125:1:A>
He can just <,> give the charge to <O> one word </O> and <,>  
submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#126:1:A>
The main reason why <,,> uh charge required to be authorise is  
because of the <}> <-> <.> delin </.> </-> <=> deliquency </=> </}> of  
customer, 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#127:1:A>
Let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five  
thousand <,> and he has applied sixty thousand <,> and he hasn't paid us till  
now <,,> so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on  
the <,> deliquency or the <,,> raise up raise debt getting accumulated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#128:1:A>
So we have to serve him certain point of time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#129:1:A>
So let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked  
here <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#130:1:A>
When <,> these customers <,> their tendencies <w> it's </w>  
normally to go and buy something above the flow limit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#131:1:A>
So when they go above the flow limit the merchant <,> ordinarly  
takes the <,> authorisation from the city bank <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#132:1:A>
So <w> let's </w> if an authorisation is declined <,> the <O> one  
word </O> of charges declined <,> and in certain cases where there are more  
sensitive cases we pick up the card <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#133:1:A>
And if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the  
merchant gets a <,,> an award of thousand <indig> rupees </indig> or put on  
<w> it's </w> depending on the value of the outstanding of the customer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#134:1:A>
So these merchants help about in uh <,> quite a good way <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#135:1:A>
And another way where we detect fraud is <,,> about uh another  
<,,> sensitive areas where these customers go <-> is </-> to the A T M <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#136:1:A>
So these customers go and try to withdraw money from the A T M <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#137:1:A>
So what we do is we block his account to the A T M <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#138:1:A>
And uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#139:1:A>
As soon as these files are tranfered to the A T M through a modem  
<,,> any card that is black listed or hot listed in the <,> A T M <,> if it  
is inserted into a A T M counter <,> the card gets wall out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#140:1:A>
You can never get the card back <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#141:1:A>
The only way that you can get the card get back you should get  
reinstated <,> or to get a new card <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#142:1:A>
So these are some ways where <,,> fraud is being detected <,> or  
is being controlled <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#143:1:A>
And the money that we made is on <,> discount that we get from  
member establishment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#144:1:A>
So <w> let's </w> say <,> this is called the plastic money and  
everybody profess <,> not to carry money <,> and they prefer to carry only  
credit card <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#145:1:A>
So we <-> go </-> negotiate with member establishment to accept  
our cards <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#146:1:A>
What is the benefit for a member establishment <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#147:1:A>
He has a larger customer base <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-042#148:1:A>
