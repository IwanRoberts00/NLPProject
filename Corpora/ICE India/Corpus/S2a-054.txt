<ICE-IND:S2A-054#1:1:A>
So <w> today's </w> <,> uh recipe is <,> the Punjabi dish we
call <indig> alu ka parontha </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#2:1:A>
It is one of uh <,,> the most favourite dishes <,> can be <-> used
<,,> to be </-> eaten at breakfast <,> or just at tea-time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#3:1:A>
It may be a little heavy for the ordinary <,,> people but I think
<,,> easy to make <,,> very tasty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#4:1:A>
Uh the ingredients that we use <,,> are mainly potatoes <,,> wheat
flour <,,> green corriander leaves <,,> salt <,,> chilli powder to your taste
<,,> and <,,> green chilli <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#5:1:A>
Take the potatoes boil them <,> till they are absolutely <,> soft
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#6:1:A>
Peel the potatoes <,,> mash them <,,> add the other ingredients <,>
that is <,,> green <,,> corriander leaves <,> cut them absolutely fine <,,>
add <,> the salt <,> according to your taste <,,> some chilli powder <,,> and
a little of <,,> <indig> ajwain </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#7:1:A>
Mix all these ingredients <,,> and prepare a ball of <,> the mashed
potatoes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#8:1:A>
Now this is the stuffing that we use <,,> for the <,> <indig>
parontha </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#9:1:A>
Regarding <,> the <,,> wheat flour <,,> take enough quantity <,,>
for your guest <,,> take a little water <,,> and knead the flour by gradually
adding <,,> the water to it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#10:1:A>
See <,> be careful you know not to make the flour <,,> very soft
the dough very soft <,,> nor very hard <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#11:1:A>
It should be medium <,> enough <,> I mean easy enough to roll it
out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#12:1:A>
Make small balls of the potato stuffing <,,> and also small balls
of the dough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#13:1:A>
Roll out <,,> the dough <,,> into a little round <,,> shape <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#14:1:A>
Yes in the shape of a small <indig> puri </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#15:1:A>
Place <,> the <,,> potato ball in the centre <,,> flatten it <,> on
the <indig> puri </indig> <,,> and now gradually cover it up with the dough
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#16:1:A>
It <,> <-> and it </-> becomes into a flat <,,> little piece <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#17:1:A>
Now roll this <,> whole piece again out <,,> by applying a little
of the dry <,> wheat flour <,,> and rolling it <,> with the rolling pin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#18:1:A>
The shape should be absolutely round <,,> the movements should be
smooth and equal so that <,> the potato stuffing <,> also moves <,> equally
within the dough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#19:1:A>
Otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing <,> and they
will be a little tasteless <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#20:1:A>
Once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a <indig>
chapati </indig> <,,> you may put it on to a heated <indig> tawa </indig>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#21:1:A>
Keep the gas at medium <,,> heat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#22:1:A>
When the <,,> first side of the <indig> chapati </indig> is ready
you may turn it over <,,> let it cook for sometime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#23:1:A>
And now apply a little <indig> ghee </indig> <,,> or oil to the
surface of the <indig> chapati </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#24:1:A>
Turn it over <,,> apply a little <indig> ghee </indig> to the other
side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#25:1:A>
And now keep moving the <indig> chapati </indig> from side to side
<,> till it turns a little golden <,> brown <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#26:1:A>
This is <,> your <indig> alu ka parontha </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#27:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sure the aroma is coming <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#28:1:A>
Well <,,> serve it to your guest <,,> along with it <,> see that
you add a little of <,,> home butter <,,> or Amul butter <,> and then ask
<,,> your guest whether they enjoy it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#29:1:A>
Of course <,,> a little of curds <,,> will add to the <,> taste of
the whole <,> dish <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#30:1:A>
This is <,> <indig> alu ka parontha </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#31:1:A>
In this way you can prepare <,> many other <indig> paronthas
</indig> also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#32:1:A>
They may be <,> with the help of raddish <,,> they may be with the
help of onion <,> and cheese <,,> cottage cheese <,,> or <,,> even with the
help of green leafy vegetables <,> like <indig> palak </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#33:1:A>
In the same way you can <,,> as you have used potatoes <,> you may
use the raddish that is <quote> grate the raddish <,,> squeeze the water out
<,,> use the same ingredients <,,> and then stuff it into the <,> dough <,,>
</quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#34:1:A>
As far as onion and cheese is concerned <,,> you may grate the
onion into the wheat flour <,> as well as the cheese <,> and then <,> knead
the dough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#35:1:A>
And the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like
<indig> palak </indig> or <indig> methi </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#36:1:A>
Cut them finely <,> wash them and knead them with the flour and you
have a variety <,> of <,,> <indig> paronthas </indig> <,,> either for tea or
for breakfast <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#37:1:A>
And one more <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#38:1:B>
You have a dish called <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#39:1:A>
Yes there are many other dishes there is no <,,> uh paucity of
dishes where the Punjabis are concerned <,,> yes

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#40:1:A>
Now these are the simplest ones <,> you can have <,,> uh what is
known as <,,> <indig> chole bhature </indig> <,> which is a very famous <,,>
uh Punjabi dish

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#41:1:C>
<O> One or two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#42:1:A>
Right <,,> <indig> chole </indig> <,,> have to be soaked that
is they are white gram <,> they have to be soaked overnight <,,> and uh <,,>
so that they rise up and become soft by morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#43:1:A>
You may grate <,,> or in a mixer you may mash about four big <,>
onions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#44:1:A>
Fry these onions to a golden brown <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#45:1:A>
Similarly <,,> add <,> the juice of say about four tomatoes <,> to
these onions after it has become golden brown <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#46:1:A>
Then you may add <,,> salt <,,> and uh chilli powder <,,> some of
the spices <,> which are also of course optional <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#47:1:A>
And after you have added all these ingredients <,> add tamarind
water a cup of tamarind water <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#48:1:A>
The <,,> <indig> chanas </indig> must be pre boiled <,,> and after
all the ingredients have been cooked well <,,> there should be no smell of
the onion remaining <,> raw onion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#49:1:A>
You now add the <indig> chanas </indig> to the <,,> cooked <indig>
masala </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#50:1:A>
Add a little warm water <,,> and let the gravy remain as thick as
you would like it <,,> that is your personal taste <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#51:1:A>
Regarding the <indig> bhaturas <,,> bhaturas </indig> are made out
of <,,> <indig> maida </indig> <,> or white flour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#52:1:A>
Like <indig> chanas </indig> they have to be prepared the previous
<+> night </+> the arrangement has to be done the previous night <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#53:1:A>
The white flour <,,> is kneaded only in curds <,,> preferably <,>
sour curd <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#54:1:A>
Once it has been kneaded well and thick <,> you don't have to make
it soft <,> you leave it overnight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#55:1:A>
And because of the sourness of the curds <,,> the flour rises up
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#56:1:A>
Next day <,> you make small balls of this flour <,> roll them up
with a rolling pin <,,> and you deep fry them <,> in oil <,> on medium heat

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#57:1:A>
These are what are known as <indig> bhaturas </indig> <,,> and with
<,> the <indig> chanas </indig> they form the dish <indig> chole bhature
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#58:1:A>
Before serving them <,,> see that you cut fine rings of raw onion
<,,> long green chillies <,,> and a lots of <,> fresh green corriander <,> to
serve with the dish <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#59:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#60:1:A>
Anything more <,,> yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#61:1:B>
I do not know that punjabi dish and <O> one or two words </O>
about <indig> samosas </indig> and <O> a few words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#62:1:C>
<indig> Kachoris </indig> is from Gujrat

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#63:1:A>
Oh <indig> kachoris </indig> are uh <,,> uh chiefly Marawari
dish

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#64:1:C>
Ahn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#65:1:A>
Yes <,,> <indig> samosas </indig> are prepared universally
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#66:1:A>
Uh <,,> if you want in uh Punjabi <w> you'll </w> have then <indig>
dahi balle <,,> dahi balle </indig> is another dish which is typically
Punjabi <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#67:1:C>
Like the <indig> dahi wada </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#68:1:A>
Yes <,> similarly <,,> or if uh <,,> if we can say <,,>
<indig> raitas </indig> are something which is totally in uh Punjabi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#69:1:A>
That is it is prepared with <,> curds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#70:1:A>
Ordinarily people prefer even <,,> in the south to have curds
directly <,> but Punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#71:1:B>
Prefer that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#72:1:A>
So we have a variety of <indig> raitas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#73:1:A>
You <,,> you may <,,> set a bowl of milk <,> in the night <,,> to
become into curds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#74:1:A>
In the morning <,> you may <,> put it into the mixer rotate it <,,>
and then you add a little <,,> salt <,,> chilli <,,> cumin powder <,,> and a
little of <,> powdered black salt to it <,,> as digestive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#75:1:A>
Then it depends on <,,> what you feel like eating that day which
<indig> raita </indig> you prefer <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#76:1:A>
It may be <,,> potato <indig> raita </indig> <,,> it may be <,,>
cucumber <indig> raita </indig> <,,> it may be <,,> with corriander and
chilli <,,> or <,,> what we know what is popularly known as <indig> kishmish
ka raita </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#77:1:A>
I think <,,> in English we will call <indig> kishmish </indig> <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#78:1:C>
Raisin

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#79:1:A>
Raisin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#80:1:A>
Yes <,> it is raisin <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#81:1:A>
Now <,,> the difference between preparing of the other <indig>
raitas </indig> and raisin is that with raisin is that <,> with raisin it is
sweet <,,> and the other <indig> raitas </indig> are <,,> with salt and
chilli <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#82:1:A>
Now when we prepare the one with raisin <,> you take about <,,> uh
half a cup of raisin <,,> you soak them into warm water <,> and leave them
for sometime so that they <,,> get soaked <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#83:1:A>
You put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds <,,>
rotate it well <,,> uh one fourth spoon of <,> salt <,,> one fourth spoon of
<,> <indig> garam masala </indig> <,,> that is all spices <,,> crushed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#84:1:A>
Now that it is ready <,> you squeeze out the <-> raisin the </->
water from the raisin and you add it to the curds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#85:1:A>
This is a special dish <,,> generally prepared on occasions <,>
because raisins are not <,,> very expensive now a days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#86:1:A>
So <,> when you have uh <,,> what you would call a <indig> dawat
</indig> <,,> you would add <,> the <indig> kishmish ka raita </indig> as one
of the dishes <,,> to the others <,,> now things on the menu <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#87:1:B>
The last uh <,> <indig> dahi wada </indig> <w> what's </w> is
like

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#88:1:A>
The <indig> dahi bhallas </indig> <,,> yes <,> it is known as
<indig> dahi bhalla </indig> <{> <[> in </[> <,,> <indig> bhalla </indig> in
<,> Punjabi <,,> <indig> dahi wada </indig> universally all over India <,>
yes <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#89:1:B>
<[> <indig> Dahi wada </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-054#90:1:A>
It can be made out of <,,> the <indig> mung dal </indig> <,,>
or the <indig> udad dal </indig> that is one is yellow in colour the other is
white <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#91:1:A>
Preferably it is the white one that is the <indig> udad dal
</indig> that is used <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#92:1:A>
You soak the <indig> dal </indig> overnight <,,> you rotate it in
the mixer <,> mixer next day <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#93:1:A>
And it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#94:1:A>
But the paste must not become thin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#95:1:A>
It should remain a little on the thick side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#96:1:A>
Once it is ready <,> you grind a little cumin seeds <,,> you grind
uh ginger <,,> and green chillies <,> and add them to the ground <indig> udad
dal </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#97:1:A>
Then heat a little oil <,> and make small balls of the <indig> udad
dal </indig> <,> and leave them into the <,> oil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#98:1:A>
Keep turning them till they are a little golden brown <,> and
remove them <,,> onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#99:1:A>
Now take <,,> a large quantity of curds <,,> mix it well beat it up
well <,> add salt <,> chilli <,,> and also a little cumin powder to it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#100:1:A>
The <indig> bhallas </indig> which have been prepared <,> should
be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#101:1:A>
As a result <,> all the oil is drained away into the warm water

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#102:1:A>
And you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#103:1:A>
Then soak it in the curds <,,> and allow it to stand for atleast
fifteen minutes <,> so that the curd penetrates into the <indig> bhalla
</indig> and softens them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#104:1:A>
Along with these it is always better to have <,> <indig> chutney
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#105:1:A>
This is known as <indig> khatti mithi chutney </indig>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#106:1:A>
You prepare it out of <,,> dates <,,> that is <indig> khajur
</indig> and out of <,,> tamarind water <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#107:1:A>
Soak the tamarind for half an hour <,,> squeeze it out <,> thick
liquid <,> add a little water <,,> sugar <,> about half a spoon <,,> little
salt <,,> chilli powder <,,> cumin powder and corriander powder to it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#108:1:A>
Mix it up beat it up well <,,> so that all the ingredients <,>
form a thick <,,> paste like substance

<ICE-IND:S2A-054#109:1:A>
In the same way the dates are being soaked <,,> the seeds they
have <,> the seeds are removed <,> and they are mashed with your hand <,> and
you they form an absolutely thick paste <,,> and to that you may add or you
may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside <,> so that
when you serve the <indig> bhallas </indig> <,,> arrange them beautifully
into a dish <,,> put a little curds over it <,,> add a little <,> <.> cha
</.> <indig> khatti mithi chutney </indig> <,> on the surface <,> and a
litlle fresh green corriander <,> and serve it to your guests <,,> </I>
