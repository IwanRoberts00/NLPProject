<it> Different types of conntraceptives are available.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#7:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> <w> world's </w> oldest
known contraceptive is an ancient Egyptian pessary described in the <it>
<foreign> Petri Papyrus </foreign> </it> in 1850 BC.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#8:1>
It was made of crocodile manure and was a fairly effective spermicide.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#9:1>
Since time immemorial human society has felt the need for curbing its
growth and this has led to the development of various contraceptive methods.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#10:1>
In a lighter vein contraception means <mention> copulation without
population </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#11:1>
For centuries, people practised various contraceptive measures such
as coitus interruptus, safe periods, abstinence, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#12:1>
But it was only in the last few decades that contraceptive technology
was revolutionized by the introduction of intra uterine contraceptive
devices ( IUCD) and oral contraceptive ( OC) pills.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#13:1>
For more details on the history of contraception, see <mention>
SCIENCE TODAY </mention> , June 1987, p.54. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#14:1>
Contraception is the prevention of conception.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#15:1>
Some 30 years ago the introduction of birth-control pills and
improved IUDs produced a virtual revolution in contraceptive
technology.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#16:1>
For the first time in the history of human reproduction,
contraceptive methods which were comparatively easy and convenient to use,
reversible, effective and relatively free from major health risks became
available, giving women almost total control over the timing of their
pregnancies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#17:1>
However all current methods have some drawbacks.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#18:1>
Moreover, the perfect contraceptive is unlikely to be found in the
near future and may never be developed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#19:1>
But a wider choice of good contraceptives will increase the
possibility that, at different stages in their reproductive lives, each
individual or couple will find at least one method which will meet their
particular needs. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#20:1>
<h> <bold> Steroid-based oral contraception </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#21:1>
The oral contraceptive ( OC) pill is currently the most <O> <&>
page </&> 48 </O> popular reversible method of contraception with
approximately 55 million users world-wide.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#22:1>
Of the various types of OCs available the combined oral contraceptive
( COC), known simply as the <quote> ` pill' </quote> contains synthetic forms
of the naturally occurring female steroid hormones - - estrogen and
progesterone. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#23:1>
In the usual preparations available, 21 tablets of both estrogens
and progesterone are taken once daily from the fifth day of the menstrual
period.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#24:1>
When the whole packet is finished, the user waits seven days during
which time withdrawal bleeding occurs and then starts on a new packet.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#25:1>
The pill owes its efficacy to its ability to inhibit ovulation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#26:1>
It also causes changes in the endometrium ( lining of the uterus) and
the cervical secretions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#27:1>
Despite ongoing improvements, COCs are still associated with a
number of minor side-effects such as nausea, weight gain, menstrual spotting,
they increase the risk of benign liver tumours, decrease the quantity of
breast milk and its long-term use may make some women slightly more
susceptible to cervical cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#28:1>
More importantly OCs increase the risk of serious cardio-vascular
diseases including blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#29:1>
This risk is almost entirely confined to women over the age of 35
years who also smoke, or have hypertension and high levels of cholesterol.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#30:1>
The most recent bi-phasic and tri-phasic formulations are similar
to the COCs but vary the hormonal dose over the course of the cycle thus
reducing the total dose of synthetic hormones administered, resulting in
fewer sideeffects.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#31:1>
In bi-phasic formulations, estrogen and progesterone are given in
constant doses throughout the menstrual cycle.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#32:1>
In tri-phasic formulations, estrogen and progesterone are
administered in three distinct phases, in varying dosages, to simulate the
normal menstrual cycle, resulting in less side-effects.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#33:1>
In recent years there has been increased interest in the <quote> `
progesterone only' </quote> pill - - the so called <quote> ` mini pill'
</quote> , which may have less risk of cardio-vascular side-effects.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#34:1>
However, the mini pills do not suppress ovulation as effectively as
the COCs - - resulting in a 3 to 10 per cent failure rate per year.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#35:1>
As mini pills do not seem to interfere with lactation, they are
ideally suited for lactating mothers, because prolonged breast-feeding
itself can contribute to the contraceptive efficacy of the pill. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#36:1>
<h> <bold> Injectable contraceptive </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#37:1>
In many parts of the world and for a large number of conventional
women, injections symbolize modern medicine.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#38:1>
Their association with <quote> ` miracle drugs' </quote> may explain
why injectables are highly popular in certain parts of the world in spite of
irregular supplies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#39:1>
They are also a boon for women who cannot take COCs regularly, due to
poor motivation or forgetfulness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#40:1>
Today there are two such preparations available in the world.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#41:1>
Depo-Provera ( depot medroxy progesterone acetate or DMPA) a
three-monthly injectable developed in the US, and Noristerat ( norethisterone
enanthate or NETEN) a two-monthly injectable manufactured in Germany.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#42:1>
Mexico and China manufacture their own once-a-month preparations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#43:1>
Injectables are not yet approved in India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#44:1>
Injectables often cause irregular mid-cycle bleeding, light or
irregular menstrual flow and thereby after extended use even amenorrhoea (
the absence of any menstruation) limiting its use. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#45:1>
<h> <bold> Contraceptive implants </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#46:1>
Norplant consists of six capsules, each containing 36 <O> <&>
page, not printed </&> 49 </O> mg of levonor gestrell which is a progesterone
derivative.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#47:1>
The capsules made of silastic are inserted subdermally into the arm
using a specially designed trocar.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#48:1>
Removal is usually easy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#49:1>
Norplant-2 consisting of two slightly longer rods is also being
tested.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#50:1>
About 40 per cent of the users report an abnormal bleeding pattern
during the first year of use, but the menstrual problems diminish with time.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#51:1>
<h> <bold> Vaginal rings </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#52:1>
Injectables are not immediately reversed while implants
require a small operation to be removed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#53:1>
In contrast vaginal rings ( silicone rubber rings which are worn
like a pessary and release a constant dose of contraceptive steroids,
absorbed through the vaginal mucosa) can be reversed at any time by simply
removing the device.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#54:1>
One type of ring containing both estrogen and progesterone aims to
inhibit ovulation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#55:1>
The ring is left in place for three weeks and then removed for one
week, in a pattern similar to COCs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#56:1>
The second type contains only progesterone and can be left in place
for three months, without removal during menstruation or at the time of
intercourse. </p> <O> Photograph </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#59:1>
<h> <bold> Intra uterine devices </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#60:1>
IUDs in the form of pebbles, were used by Arabs for their camels
on long desert journeys.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#61:1>
Modern IUDS are devices made of plastic or metal or a combination of
these materials, meant for insertion into the uterine cavity for
contraception.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#62:1>
Used by an estimated 70 million women world-wide, they represent a
very effective, long-acting, one-stop method of contraception. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#63:1>
An estimated 10-15 per cent of IUD acceptors discontinue use
because of pains, bleeding problems.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#64:1>
Between 5 to 15 per cent will spontaneously expel the IUD.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#65:1>
In addition IUDs are associated with 2 to 10 times greater risk of
pelvic infections.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#66:1>
Since pelvic infections carry a substantial risk of subsequent
infertility, an IUD is not a good method for newly married couples, for women
exposed to sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs) or those who have multiple
sexual partners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#67:1>
Although the precise mechanism of its action is unknown,
interference with successful implantation of the fertilized ovum in the
endometrium and or affection of the ovum or sperm in the uterine cavity seem
to play a role. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#68:1>
Modifications in design over the years have significantly
reduced failure rates and side-effects such as pain, bleeding, infection and
expulsion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#69:1>
The introduction of copper-bearing IUDs represents one such advance
in IUD design.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#70:1>
Copper IUDs release small amounts of ionic copper making the uterus
additionally inhospitable to sperms and eggs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#71:1>
Progestgasert, an IUD which releases small amounts of progesterone
directly into the uterus causes less menstrual loss and may reduce pain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#72:1>
Its drawback includes a limited life span of only one year and a
higher incidence of ectopic pregnancy. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#73:1>
<h> <bold> Voluntary sterilization </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#74:1>
Over the past two decades there has been a dramatic upswing in
the use of voluntary sterilization.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#75:1>
World-wide, over one third of all couples practising an effective
modern method of contraception now rely on male sterilization ( vasectomy)
or female sterilization ( tubectomy).

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#76:1>
One important reason for its increased use has been the development
of two relatively simple procedures, laparoscopic sterilization and
mini-laparotomy which allows female sterilization to be done on an
out-patient basis without general anaesthesia.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#77:1>
Male sterilization continues to be an even safer and simpler
procedure.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#78:1>
Although reversibility is possible, all current sterilization
procedures <O> Photograph </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#79:1>
<it> Inserteor for an IUD, multiload IUD, and copper T </it> </O>
should be undertaken with the clear understanding that the operation is
permanent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#80:1>
Recognition of the potential importance of a nonsurgical
method has encouraged considerable experimentation with chemical agents
that block the fallopian tubes ( such as quinacrine, methyl cyanoacrilate,
phenol and tetracycline).

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#81:1>
These compounds can be injectted via the cervix into the oviducts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#82:1>
Another technique involves the use of liquid silicone which when
instilled in-side the fallopian tubes, hardens in place to form a plug
preventing the passage of eggs and sperms. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#83:1>
<h> <bold> Barrier methods </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#84:1>
Barrier methods which prevent the union of sperm and egg
necessary for pregnancy, are the oldest contraceptives known.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#85:1>
Condoms, spermicides, diaphrams and other female barrier methods have
many early predecessors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#86:1>
Condoms are now being strenuously promoted in an effort to
prevent an epidemic of AIDS and other STDs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#87:1>
Condoms need no prescription and are easily available.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#88:1>
They are especially suitable for couples who have infrequent coitus,
during lactation, or in teen-agers who have occasional sex, to prevent
illegal pregnancies. </p>

<p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#92:1>
The conventional cervical cap is a rubber cap or hood used to
cover the cervix to form a barrier against sperm.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#93:1>
Used together with a spermicide, they can be left in place for about
six hours after intercourse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#94:1>
All barrier methods continue to have the same major
disadvantages.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#95:1>
Average use failure rates of between 10 to 20 per cent per year, are
much higher than those nonsteroidal methods or IUDS.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#96:1>
Moreover they require the user to take a conscious action to avoid
pregnancy before each sexual act.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#97:1>
Clinical tests are now under way to evaluate a new custom - - fitted
cap moulded to the shape and size of the cervix.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#98:1>
One such cap <quote> ` Contracep' </quote> may not require a
spermicide, can be worn for extended periods and has a unique one-way valve
that permits menstrual flow. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#99:1>
<h> <bold> Periodic abstinence </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#100:1>
Abstinence from sexual intercourse during the <w> woman's </w>
fertile period, often referred to as ` natural family planning', relies on
such old and new techniques as the calendar ( rhythm) method, the basal body
temperature ( BBT) method, the cervical mucus ( Billings ovulation)
method and the sympto-thermal method.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#101:1>
The latter relies on the combination of indicators of fertility such
as changes in cervical mucus to predict ovulation and BBT to detect its
occurrence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#102:1>
High levels of motivation and good communication between sexual
partners is essential as all methods require substantial periods of sexual
abstinence every cycle. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#103:1>
The main thrust of research is in development of reliable
<quote> ` use-at-home' </quote> indicators of ovulation such as
do-it-yourself kits to test hormone levels in urine or saliva or to detect
changes in cervical mucus. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#104:1>
<h> <bold> Contraceptives of the future </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#105:1>
Four general areas of research activity are widely agreed to
have special importance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#106:1>
These are concerned with menstrual induction and progesterone
inhibitors, synthetic analogues of hypothalamus hormones, the male pill and
anti-fertility vaccines. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#107:1>
One of the major gaps in current birth-control technology is
the lack of post-coital methods which could be used a few days or weeks after
unprotected intercourse <O> <&> page </&> 52 </O> <O> TABLE </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#108:1>

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#109:1>
A double dose of certain full-strength COCs ( such as ovral) taken
within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse and repeated after 12 hours,
can prevent pregnancy by interfering with fertilization or with
implantation of a fertilized egg. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#110:1>
Mifepristone ( RU486) a competitive inhibitor of
progesterone, is capable of interrupting early pregnancy when given either
before or just after the first missed period.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#111:1>
In a Paris-based study of 10 women given RU486 within 10 days of a
missed period, 85 women aborted.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#112:1>
Studies show that RU486 can be developed into a safe and effective
<quote> ` once-a-month' </quote> contraceptive pill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#113:1>
In the last several years there has been considerable progress
towards an entirely new method based on synthetic analogues of hormones
produced in the hypothalamus of the brain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#114:1>
Early clinical trials have shown that certain luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH) analogues administered daily are effective
in suppressing ovulation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#115:1>
Although current experiments involve the use of nasal sprays, since
the hormones are not effective if taken orally, some type of a long-acting
release system may be possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#116:1>
The contraceptive effect of the male pill ( gossypol) a
cottonseed-oil derivative was accidentally discovered in China.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#117:1>
It decreases sperm counts to contraceptive levels.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#118:1>
Reversibility is possible after stopping the pills, but
infertility appears to become long-term or even permanent
among 20 to 30 per cent of long-term users. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#119:1>
Anti-fertility vaccines including immunization against pregnancy
is an attractive idea but difficult to achieve in practice.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#120:1>
The most promising vaccination technique is immunization against
chorionic gonadotropin ( a hormonal product of placenta which is essential
for pregnancy). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-009#121:1>
Refinements in COCS and IUDS and better understanding of the
relative contra-indications to their use have made these methods extremely
safe.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#122:1>
New long-acting systems for delivering progesterone are effective
and will probably be more popular in developing countries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#123:1>
Until such time as a ideal reversible contraceptive is discovered,
most couples in the Third World will rely heavily on voluntary
sterilization.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#124:1>
Because of early marriage, many couples complete their child-bearing
by the age of 25, when they still face approximately 20 years of
reproductive life.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#125:1>
For many of these women additional pregnancies imply serious health
risks, and they view permanent surgical contraception - - the one method
which is virtually 100 per cent effective, not only as a good method, but
probably as the best method.

<ICE-IND:W2D-009#126:1>
Hence in sequence, a newly married couple is advised the OC pill
until they want their first child, thereafter the copper T for three or more
years which is ideal for birth-spacing and after the second child they are
adivsed tubectomy or vasectomy. </p> <O> logo </O> </I>
