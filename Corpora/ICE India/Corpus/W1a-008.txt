<h> <ul> INTRODUCTION : </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#4:1>
In ancient India, women enjoyed a very high status in society,
which is evident from the fact that many religious rituals were not regarded
as complete unless they were present.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#5:1>
Women were also considered as a <quote> " Devi" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#6:1>
But with the change in the social, political and economic pattern of
the country, a status of women witnessed a decline.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#7:1>
This situation continued for quite a long period until reformists like
<mention> Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Dayanand Saraswati,
G. K. Gokhale Mahatma Jotiba Phule </mention> and <mention> D. K. Karve
</mention> , started a social movement for the improvement of <w> women's
</w> conditions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#8:1>
Later on the leadership of the women was taken up by some eminent
women as Kamala Devi Chattopadhya, Sarojini Naidu, Dr. Mathulaxmi Reddy and
others.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#9:1>
The movement for <w> women's </w> emancipation gradually gained
momentum, and as a result the women of India were granted equality in all
spheres of life alongwith men.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#10:1>
The Constitution of India declares, <quote> " The State shall not
discriminate against any citizen on grounds of sex, religion, race, caste or
place of birth or any of these." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#11:1>
Although the Constitution grants equal status and rights to
everyone without any discrimination of sex; women in most <O> <&> page </&> 2
</O> cases cannot avail themselves of opportunities because of various
factors such as illiteracy and poverty, and social conventions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#12:1>
The Census Reort, 1991 indicates that the female literacy ratio in
the country was 39.4 per cent in the total population.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#13:1>
Similarly, the number of women workers was 8.9 <indig> crores
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#14:1>
Roughly speaking women form one-half of the total population ( 48 % )
giving 2 / 3 of the total working hours, produce 1 / 10 of the total
production and they own only 1 / 100th of property in their names.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#15:1>
Their share in unemployment was slightly higher than men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#16:1>
The employment opportunities for women are less because of social
physical and biological factors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#17:1>
From these facts it is evident that there is an urgent need for
initiating crash programmes for elevating the employment and status of women
in the country. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#18:1>
<h> <ul> RURAL WOMEN : THE NEGLECTED SECTOR : </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#19:1>
Agriculture and allied fields provide the largest opportunities
for <w> women's </w> employment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#20:1>
It largely determines the rural <w> women's </w> socio-economic
status.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#21:1>
This is the sector where <w> women's </w> role as unpaid labour in
productive activities is most prominent and is responsible for conferring
women a non-working status.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#22:1>
The rural women are only regarded as the factors of production i.e.
labour.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#23:1>
The reason behind this is <O> <&> page </&> 3 </O> that the women do
not have the land on their own account.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#24:1>
Our land records do not show the rights of women in the landed
property.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#25:1>
Only where a women is a widow, her name is figured in the record.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#26:1>
Therefore, women cannot get credit facilities directly on their name;
as a result of which women in rural <}> <-> area </-> <+> areas </+> </}> are
<}> <-> enable </-> <+> unable </+> </}> to establish <-> ; </-> their own
economic image.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#27:1>
<}> <-> the </-> <+> The </+> </}> financial institutions generally
hesitate to finance the women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#28:1>
Though women <}> <-> has </-> <+> have </+> </}> equal rights in the
fixed property of parents and husband yet there is lack of appreciation on
part of the gents.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#29:1>
The position of tribal women is worst.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#30:1>
The women in such areas are helping the family in bringing the
fire-wood and selling it in the market to meet their both ends meet.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#31:1>
This shows that the large section of the rural women is being
exploited. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#32:1>
<h> <ul> STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE STATUS OF WOMEN THROUGH
CO-OPERATIVES </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#33:1>
The most important means of achieving improvement in the status
of women would be secure for them a <}> <-> fare </-> <+> fair </+> </}>
share of employment opportunities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#34:1>
Areas and sectors where women employment is either low or <+> they
are </+> on the decline would be identified and co-operative measures be
initiated to promote additional avenues for employment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#35:1>
The efforts would be made to offer employment for women in the
co-operative activities like public distribution system, co-operative
dairies, rural godowns, social forestry, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#36:1>
The strict implementation of equal Remuneration Act, 1976, has <O>
<&> page </&> 4 </O> to be done.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#37:1>
A major step to be taken to promote female employment <-> , </->
would be to expand and diversify the education and training opportunities
available to women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#38:1>
In order to promote self-employment and small-scale industry
employment, the most crucial requirement is the allocation of commercial and
co-operative bank credit. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#39:1>
<h> <ul> PRESENT POSITION OF <w> WOMEN'S </w> CO-OPERATIVES IN INDIA
: </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#40:1>
The co-operative movement was started in 1904 for providing
credit to farmers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#41:1>
Subsequently, the laws were amended to allow for the formation of
other types of co-operative societies.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#42:1>
At present, the Indian co-operative movement in terms of size and
membership is one of the largest in the world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#43:1>
The Co-operatives in India have made notable progress in the field of
agricultural credit, marketing processing, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#44:1>
The number of all types of co-operative exceeds 3.5 <indig> lakhs
</indig> with a membership of 15.6 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#45:1>
At present there are 7,500 women co-operatives in the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#46:1>
Out of them in Maharashtra, 1,372 are established and 1,027 women
co-operatives are in working.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#47:1>
The participation and involvement of women in the co-operative
movement is not adequate and substantial. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#48:1>
A majority of women's co-operative societies were thrift and
credit, <del> encouraging the women's societies were thrift and credit </del>
encouraging the women to save and provide them credit on easy terms.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#49:1>
Next to thrift societies, there were industrial <O> <&> page </&> 5
</O> co-operatives such as <w> weavers' </w> societies.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#50:1>
These co-operatives undertook activities such as tailoring, spinning,
<}> <-> embroidary, </-> <+> embroidery </+> </}> knitting, <indig> durri
</indig> - making, preparation of <indig> papad </indig> , pickles and jams.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#51:1>
Some societies and sewing and <}> <-> embroidary </-> <+> embroidery
</+> </}> classes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#52:1>
In Maharashtra <w> women's </w> co-operatives were engaged in
handcraft industries.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#53:1>
There were poultry, printing, cane work, and urban co-operative banks
also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#54:1>
In <}> <-> God, </-> <+> good </+> </}> <w> women's </w>
co-operatives were running a Canteen and in Madhya Pradesh some societies
were running libraries.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#55:1>
There are some examples of <w> women's </w> co-operatives which are
running nursery school and medical centres.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#56:1>
The women in rural area can undertake handicraft, horticulture,
floricutlure, poultry, bee-keeping, sericulture, seed bank, cultivation of
medicine plants, sheep keeping etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#57:1>
Such societies are of immense benefit to women as they get employment
and render services to needy women. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#58:1>
<h> <ul> RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND WOMEN CO-OPERATIVES </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#59:1>
Co-operative movement in India has achieved quantitative
progress, but it is lacking in qualitative development.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#60:1>
The number of co-operative seminars at the various <}> <-> level,
</-> <+> levels </+> </}> during the last few years deliberated on <}> <->
wage </-> <+> ways </+> </}> and means to induce professional management in
co-operation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#61:1>
At the same time, it is also considered that due to lack of
participation of women in co-operatives, the co-operatives are not running
efficiently.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#62:1>
Therefore, the Central and the State governments realised, the <O>
<&> page </&> 6 </O> inclusion of women members on the board of directors of
co-operatives.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#63:1>
The Government of Maharashtra, as well as many other states have
amended their respective co-operative society Act and made provisions to give
30 % representation to women members on the Board of Directors for all types
of co-operative societies.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#64:1>
Accordingly, in Maharashtra women members representation on the Board
of Directors on the co-operative society has been determined from 1 to 3
women members depending upon the total number of Board of Directors. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#65:1>
<h> <ul> WOMEN AND BETTER LIVING ASPECTS IN AGRICULTURAL
CO-OPERATIVES IN JAPAN </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#66:1>
<w> Women's </w> Association of Agricultural Co-operatives (
WAAC) of Japan has contributed a great deal to the development of
agricultural and the development of rural house-holds.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#67:1>
The WAAC are carrying out the credit, marketing and purchasing
activities, they also help their members in insurance business also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#68:1>
The WAAC covers the better living styles of rural women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#69:1>
The styles of standard of living of rural women are almost equal to
the urban women in Japan.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#70:1>
These societies are helping their members in respect of keeping the
healthy environment and in safe living.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#71:1>
The WAAC have developed kitchen gardens in almost every <}> <->
farmers </-> <+> <w> farmer's </w> </+> </}> house.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#72:1>
Health care for family members is another important contribution of
WAAC.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#73:1>
The WAAC is financially independent and has democratic management.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#74:1>
In short, <w> women's </w> associations in Japan cover all aspects of
human life and try to co-relate them with the agricultural co-operatives. <O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#75:1>
<h> <ul> RURAL <w> WOMEN'S </w> CO-OPERATIVES AND DEVELOPMENT : SOME
EXAMPLES : Dairy and Women </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#76:1>
Dairying is an important subsidiary occupation to reduce pressure
on crop production in rural areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#77:1>
It is more labour intensive than crop farming.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#78:1>
Dairying provides continuous employment to the farmers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#79:1>
The point in favour of women in dairying is that the operations are
not as much strenous as in crops.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#80:1>
There is a greater degree of indoor activity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#81:1>
As such there is scope for women to participate in the dairy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#82:1>
<mention> The Indian Institute of Public Opinion </mention> has
pointed out that the number of women engaged in dairy farming is increasing
every year.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#83:1>
A number of dairy co-operatives have been set-up and run exclusively
by the women in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#84:1>
The example of <mention> Priyadarshani <w> Women's </w>
Co-operative Dairy Society Ltd. <+> , </+> </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#85:1>
Kagal can be highlighted.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#86:1>
Six years back, the <quote> ` <w> women's </w> organisation' </quote>
at Kagal ( Dist. Kolhapur ) thought to organise the dairy co-operative
society for women, and it is working sucessfully.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#87:1>
This is all women dairy co-operative.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#88:1>
The membership at this society was 176 and all the employees were
also women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#89:1>
There are few more <w> women's </w> dairy co-operatives in Kolhapur
district.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#90:1>
These societies are supplying the credit facilities to their members
as well as they have undertaken the production of milk also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#91:1>
The number of such societies is more in Balsad District ( Gujarat )
and Chitoor District in Andhra Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#92:1>
In field survey, it was <O> <&> page </&> 8 <O> noticed that majority
of the <w> women's </w> milk co-operatives were formed whereever the milk
co-operatives formed by <}> <-> male were </-> <+> males went </+> </}> into
liquidation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#93:1>
<h> <ul> Credit Co-operatives and Women </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#94:1>
The history of co-operative movement shows that there were <w>
women's </w> credit societies in old Punjab State, followed by Madras and
Bombay state.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#95:1>
Recently, many states are having <w> women's </w> co-operative credit
societies including Maharashtra.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#96:1>
Maharashtra is the number one State in respect of <w> women's </w>
credit societies as well as urban banks.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#97:1>
Many of the credit societies are in rural areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#98:1>
To name one of them is <mention> Vitahalai Mahila Sahakari Pat
Sanstha Ltd. Kh. Tarale, Taluka Radhanagari, District Kolhapur. </mention>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#99:1>
This <w> women's </w> co-operative credit society was formed by
the women, for the women and of the women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#100:1>
This society is having 1,500 members working in its eight branches.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#101:1>
It has collected the deposits of Rs. 4 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#102:1>
As such this not a primary credit society, but functioning like a
Rural Bank.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#103:1>
Besides, the loan activities, the society has undertaken social
activities such as medical check-up camps, students guidance, family welfare,
etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#104:1>
The work done by this society is appreciated by the television
and many journalists.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#105:1>
As a result of the emergence of credit societies thousands of women
could undertake their self employment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#106:1>
There are several other types <O> <&> page </&> 9 <O> of <w> women's
</w> co-operative such as <mention> Savitri Sahakari Udhyog Sanstha
</mention> at Warananagar, Ichalkaranji, Hupari ( Dist. Kolhapur ) and in
Sangli, Satara districts also. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#107:1>
<h> <ul> CONSTRAINTS IN DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL WOMEN </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#108:1>
Some problems and constraints experienced in managing rural
women co-operatives are listed below :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#109:1>
1. <ul> Iliteracy and Ignorance </ul> :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#110:1>
Lower rate of female literacy is one of the improtant factors, which
prevents women involvement in the rural co-opera-tives.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#111:1>
The illiterate and semi-literate women feel shy to join the
co-operatives, as they have no clear understanding about the concept and
management of co-operatives.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#112:1>
2. <ul> Financial constraints </ul> :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#113:1>
Although there are various financial agencies for providing finance
to co-operatives, yet complex official procedure of these agencies creates
barrier for women to undertake co-operative activities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#114:1>
3. <ul> Limitations in Co-operative Laws </ul> :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#115:1>
The Co-operative Acts, Rules and By-laws prevent women to join
co-operatives, for example, in village level <+> . </+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#116:1>
<}> <-> multiple </-> <+> Multiple </+> </}> co-operative societies
the membership is open to those who have <O> <&> page </&> 10 </O> in their
name.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#117:1>
Generally women do not possess land, as a result of which they fail
to become members of the society.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#118:1>
4. <ul> Political Hinderance </ul> :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#119:1>
The major problem is political <}> <-> hinderance </- > <+>
hindrance </+> </}> by male political leaders, in view of the fact, that the
women Presidents of the societies play a role in election of the higher level
of federation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#120:1>
This affects the progress of women co-operatives.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#121:1>
5. <ul> Lack of Policy Decision </ul> :

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#122:1>
There is no policy formulated by the movement for the promotion of
rural <w> women's </w> co-operatives, except the efforts made by Government
of Maharashtra.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#123:1>
Recently, the Maharashtra Government has formulated the policy to
form <w> women's </w> multipurpose service co-operative society at village
level.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#124:1>
Of course, the viability of such societies is doubtful. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#125:1>
<h> <ul> CONCLUSIONS </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-008#126:1>
Although the constitution of India, grants equal status and
right, to everyone, without any discrimination of sex, women, in most cases
cannot avail themselves of opportunities, because of various factors such as
illiteracy and poverty and social <}> <-> convention. </-> <+> conventions.
</+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#127:1>
The foregoing discussion shows that the status of rural women is <}>
<-> more worst </-> <+> worse </+> </}> than the urban women, <O> <&> page
</&> 11 </O> though their work participation is equal to the gents.

<ICE-IND:W1A-008#128:1>
The issue of rural women development has been discussed and it seems
that due to the formation of rural <w> women's </w> co-operatives the status
as well the socio-economic conditions of women can be improved. </I>
