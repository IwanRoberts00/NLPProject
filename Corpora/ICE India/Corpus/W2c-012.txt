<h> Deshbandhu College in Ferment </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#2:1>
Turmoil gripped Deshbandhu College in South Delhi when its
teachers and other employees launched an agitation for elevation of a senior
section officer to the post of its administrative officer.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#3:1>
This affected the holding of the classes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#4:1>
The students, thereupon, took upon themselves the task of running the
classes, with the senior ones amongst themselves teaching the junior ones.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#5:1>
However, the teachers and other employees of the college complained
that they had been prevented from entering the premises by the students,
which was, however, denied by the principal, Mr. Balbir Singh, who stated
that the college alumni had obtained his permission to conduct the classes as
the teachers were refraining from doing their job.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#6:1>
The teachers association decried the <w> principal's </w> unethical
involvement of the students as setting a dangerous precedent. </p> </I>

<h> Strike by AIIMS Doctors </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#8:2>
In protest against an alleged act of victimisation of a doctor
in the CTVS ( cardiological and vascular surgery) department, Samba
Murty, by its head, Dr. Venugopal, recently, about 550 senior and junior
resident doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS), New
Delhi, observed a token strike on December 20, 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#9:2>
As a result, the work in the AIIMS was thrown out of gear, mostly
affecting the casualty department, OPD ( Out patient department), OT (
operation theatre), wards and laboratories in the hospital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#10:2>
According to the Resident <w> Doctors' </w> Association, Dr.
Samba Murty had been failed in his departmental examination maliciously by
Dr. Venugopal, who was biased against the former.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#11:2>
It was alleged that in 1987, Dr. Murty had been falsely involved
in a case in which a consultant of the department was at fault, and kept out
of the OT and ward duties.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#12:2>
On the intervention of the Resident <w> Doctors' </w> association,
Dr. Samba Murty had been taken back in the department.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#13:2>
Subsequently, during the next two years, Dr. Venugopal boycotted
all his teaching exercises and did not allow him to assist in surgery and
enter the OT.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#14:2>
The RDA has demanded Dr. Samba <w> Murty's </w> re-examination in a
just and fair manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#15:2>
However, an AIIMS spokesman subsequently denied there having
been any victimisation of the candidate or any other kind of irregularity in
his examination. </p> </I>

<h> Head <w> Constable's </w> Daughter burnt by In-laws </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#17:3>
Mr. Baldev Raj, a head constable of the Delhi Police, made the
allegation that his daughter, Mrs. Asha Rani Kalra, aged 30, was set on
fire and killed on December 10, 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#18:3>
The local police, it was alleged, was not conducting any proper
investigation into the case.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#19:3>
The place of the occurrence of the crime had not been marked off nor
the inculpating things, such as the burnt clothes of the victim, seized.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#20:3>
Mr. Raj further alleged that the investigating officer had so far
failed to sound the neighbours on the tragic happening or visit their houses.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#21:3>
These allegations were, however, denied by the Assistant Commissioner
of Police of the area. </p> </I>

The various <indig> <it> gharanas </it> </indig> of the Indian
classical music have played an important role in nourishing and nurturing
its rich traditions and making their own contributions to its further
development.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#24:4>
The Delhi <indig> <it> gharana </it> </indig> , contrary to the
belief of many <foreign> connoisseurs </foreign> , is not at all moribund,
but still alive and kicking.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#25:4>
<quote> " I stand comparison with any other vocalist, there is no
instrumentalist to beat down Zahoor Ahmed, and our Shafaat is hard to be
excelled by any other percussionist on the <indig> tabla </indig> , "
</quote> asserted the Delhi <indig> <it> gharana khalifa </it> </indig> or
doyen, Iqbal Ahmed Khan, with a firm, sincere note in his voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#26:4>
Indian classical music is broadly demarcated into two genres - -
the Hindustani or North Indian and Karnataki. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#27:4>
A <indig> <it> gharana </it> </indig> , as the word
etymologically indicates, means a particular style or <it> genre </it> of
music which has grown in a <indig> <it> ghar </it> </indig> or household,
with the help of a <foreign> maestro </foreign> of the art, and spread
amongst his family members and other disciples over the decades and even
centuries.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#28:4>
Thus, there have evolved the Seni ( Rampur), Agra, Gwalior, Lucknow,
and the like, <indig> <it> gharanas </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#29:4>
The Indian Council of Cultural Relations ( ICCR) has been, of
late, arranging concerts under its <it> Parivar Parampara </it> series,
to focus attention of the music-loving public on the traditional, distinctive
niceties and nuances the different <indig> <it> gharanas </it> </indig> in
India have, over the past so many years, developed and shaped, each in its
own way, to enrich the Indian classical music.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#30:4>
On the 15th December, 1989, the ICCR organised a concert to highlight
the characteristic achievements of the Delhi <indig> <it> gharana </it>
</indig> with the participation of Sayeed Zafar ( <indig> sitar </indig> ) ,
Iqbal Ahmed Khan ( vocal), Zahoor Ahmed Khan ( violin) and Shafaat Ahmed
Khan ( <indig> tabla </indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#31:4>
A pleasurable <indig> Kirwani </indig> was the theme of Sayeed
<w> Zafar's </w> <indig> sitar </indig> , giving flashes of his expertise as
a <foreign> virtuoso </foreign> of sorts.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#32:4>
Iqbal Ahmed <w> Khan's </w> rendition of the <indig> <it> raag </it>
Anand Bihag </indig> was followed by a mixed <indig> Piloo Thumri </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#33:4>
Zahoor <w> Ahmed's </w> violin, accompanied with the percussion (
<indig> tabla </indig> ) of Shafaat Ahmed Khan, gave a good account of the
<indig> <it> raag </it> Bageswari </indig> , characterised with the <indig>
<it> gayaki </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> tankari angs </it> </indig>
alike. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#34:4>
The Delhi <indig> <it> gharana </it> </indig> , tracing its
genesis to Amir Khusro, the great Sufi bard, though now a bit off its
pristine glory and glamour, has preserved its stylistic purity and the
characteristic versatility of its <indig> <it> taans </it> </indig> , <indig>
<it> bandishes </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> layakari </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#35:4>
One, however, would hope that the thinning phalanx of the
practitioners of this <indig> <it> gharana </it> </indig> , which can now
boast of only a few <foreign> virtuosi </foreign> and a <foreign> maestro
</foreign> or two, would be swollen with the addition of more creative
stalwarts of the art. </p> </I>

Mr. Bhure Lal was the official in the Finance Ministry in the
erstwhile Prime Minister Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w> Government, who, as the
Director of Enforcement, was entrusted by the then Finance Minister V.P.
Singh with the task of hiring the US detective agency, Fairfax, to obtain
information of the Indian holders of secret numbered accounts in certain
Swiss banks.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#38:5>
It may be recalled that this event led to the parting of ways between
the former Prime Minister and his Finance Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#39:5>
Soon, thereafter, Mr. V.P. Singh was shifted to the Defence Ministry
and Mr. Bhure Lal from his post of Director of Enforcement to that of
Joint Secretary, currency and coins, Finance Ministry.

<h> Lock-out in Indian <w> Express's </w> Delhi Chapter </h> <O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#42:6>
The journalist and non-journalist employees of the Delhi edition
of <it> The Indian Express </it> , who had been for long agitating in this
behalf, went on strike, a few days ago, having failed to get the management
to meet their demands for the refixation of their scales of salaries and
wages in terms of the Bachawat Commission report, which treated the chain
newspapers as representing a single composite establishment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#43:6>
Subsequently, on its heels, <it> The Indian Express </it>
management declared a lock-out, dubbing the <w> employees' </w> demands as
unwarranted and unacceptable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#44:6>
Condemning the lock-out, the Indian Federation of Working
Journalists ( Democratic) and the All India Newspaper <w> Employees' </w>
Federation, in a press statement, held that the <w> management's </w>
refusal to honour the Bachawat Commission award would have been justified, if
it could have obtained a court order to stay the implementation of the scales
of wages, etc., fixed by it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#45:6>
The wage board documents revealed, the DUJ and DSNEF maintained,
that the Indian Newspaper Society, the representative organisation of the
newspaper employers, had admitted that for the clubbing of newspaper
establishments for the purpose of wage fixation, the test of functional
integrity should be treated as the supreme one of its kind.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#46:6>
The Bachawat Commission report stated, <X> <quote> " Functional
integrity has been provided by us as one of the indicators of common
control.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#X47:6>
Units, apparently separate, if they have functional integrity
or constitute a composite whole, lose their individual character <*>
dotted-line</*>" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#48:6>
The DUJ and DSNEF gave out that it was in keeping with this
formula that all the Goenka newspapers have been clubbed as one establishment
with respect to the fixation of the scales of wages. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#49:6>
Meanwhile, the Delhi Union of Journalists, an affiliate of the
National Union of Journalists ( India), expressed its full sympathy with the
employees of <it> The Indian Express </it> now on strike.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#50:6>
The DUJ called for the intervention of the Delhi Administration and
the Union Government in the dispute, declaring the lock-out illegal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#51:6>
The Delhi <w> Journalists' </w> Association President Balbir K.
Punj stated that his organisation was arranging to challenge the illegal
lock-out in a law court. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#54:7>
<@PR> PANJIM {#}, <@DR> Feb. 24 {#}:
The <w> People's </w> Carnival, which got off to a flying start here this
morning, turned out to be a tremendous crowd puller, with a large number of
floats marching through the streets of the city to the tune of music. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#55:7>
The highlight of the carnival was the fun car/motorcycle/cycle
rally which had all sorts of vehicles including some junk ones, either driven
or being pulled along the road.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#56:7>
A couple of bullock carts were also there in the rally one of which
was driven by motorcycles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#57:7>
The fun rally was flagged-off by the Mayor of the city Mr.
Francisco Branco, in the presence of MLA Mr. J.B. Gonsalves and
councillors Mr. Domnick Fernandes and Mr. Mangaldas Naik.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#58:7>
Mr. Robert Alvares, one of the organisers was present on the
specially erected dais at Church Square here, that marked the inauguration of
<w> people's </w> carnival at 5 p.m. as scheduled. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#59:7>
Right from the inauguration venue till the route of the rally on
the 18th June Road, the entire area was flooded with enthusiastic people who
frequently blocked the movement of the floats, much to the annoyance of the
organisers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#60:7>
With minimum police arrangement to control the <w> people's </w>
carnival, the organisers were forced to make repeated appeals to the crowd to
co-operate by not blocking the movement of the floats. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#61:7>
Floats were many and had a variety.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#62:7>
There was <w> fisherman's </w> house, cottages, tavernas and even a
float based on the idea of <quote> 'how to make an illegal house safe'
</quote> ( own a mobile house - - the title said).

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#63:7>
One float depicted <quote> 'green Goa, bountiful Goa' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#64:7>
The participation of children was also quite remarkable.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#65:7>
The maskmen either riding scooters, cycles or just strolling along
the rally route kept the crowd and kids in particular, <}> <-> entertaining

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#69:7>
The response to the float rally was tremendous with large number
of entries not only in the group floats but also good participation in
individual and couples floats </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#70:7>
The last float by Mr. Francisco Martins turned out to be good.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#71:7>
The huge float received good response from the crowd. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#72:7>
The organisers decorated the route with streamers balloons and
confetti all over the place.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#73:7>
There was a running <}> <-> commentry </-> <+> commentary </+> </}>
for the people on the public mike system.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#74:7>
There was music by the Strangers, to the delight of revellers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#75:7>
Showering of flower petals by a helicopter was an added
attraction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#76:7>
Lots of other programmes were held all over the State to mark the
beginning of the four-day fun festival of carnival. </p> </I>

<@PR> NASHIK {#}, <@DR> February 24 {#} <@SR> UNI {#}):
Seven people, including two children, were burnt to death and 12
others received serious burn injuries when their huts caught fire
following a gas leak from a gas tanker which rammed into a tree last
morning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#79:8>
According to a report reaching here today, the tanker was on the
Bombay-Agra National Highway when it met with accident.

<ICE-IND:W2C-012#80:8>
The gas emerged from a broken outlet pipe of the tanker and spread in
the nearby village while people were yet asleep. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-012#81:8>
The report said, three people including the tanker driver were
burnt to death on the spot while the others succumbed to their injuries last
evening at the Dhule Civil Hospital, where they had been admitted. </p>
