<ICE-IND:W1B-021#21:1>
Sir, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#22:1>
Last year ( 1993-94 ) the Deptt. of Economics was
allowed to  
admit <ul> 68 </ul> students for M.A.-I class. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#23:1>
Of these, <ul> 6 </ul> students dropped out <ul> 62
</ul> appeared  
for the exam. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#24:1>
During last 3 / 4 years, the drop out ratio has been
10 to 15 %. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#25:1>
This year, the Deptt. has received, in all <ul> 74
</ul>  
applications for M.A. part-I. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#26:1>
On the basis of normally enhanced quota for Social
Science Classes,  
of <ul> 60 </ul> students, excluding the quota of <ul> 6 </ul>
students from  
other Universities, the reservation quota turns out to be <ul>
27 </ul> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#27:1>
However, the number of applicants belonging to
reserved categories is  
only <ul> 21 </ul> , of which <ul> 10 </ul> get included in
the open merit  
list. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#28:1>
Remaining <ul> 11 </ul> students get admission in the
reservation  
quota, even without increasing the total intake. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#29:1>
However, this year, we have received <ul> 7 </ul>
applications from  
commerce students, three of which are fairly good in merit.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#30:1>
I, therefore, request you to kindly allow this
Department. to  
admit <ul> 70 </ul> students for M.A. part I. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#31:1>
I am enclosing herewith Two copies of the statement
showing  
category-wise admissions. </p>

Dear Dr. Katar Singh 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#51:1>
I am writing this letter after a pretty long time.


<ICE-IND:W1B-021#52:1>
I met Dr. D.K. Marothia at the 52nd Annual conference
of the Indian  
Society of Agricultural Economics held under the auspices of
the Tamil Nadu  
Agricultural University, Coimbatore. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#53:1>
He informed me of some Seminar on Cooperative
Management held at IRMA  
sometime in the middele of 1992 and told that I was invited by
you for the  
same, but I did not respond. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#54:1>
It was a surprise for me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#55:1>
Because, I did not receive any communication from your
side in that  
respect. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#56:1>
As such, there was no question of my not responding to
your call. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#57:1>
I would have immediately acknowledged and made all
efforts to be  
there . Any way this is a thing of the past. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#58:1>
I look forward to a new opportunity. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-021#59:1>
Incidentally, my book ` Economics of Tobacco' is
recently in the  
market. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#60:1>
It studies the cost and price of <indig> bidi </indig>
tobacco. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-021#61:1>

Library.

Taking into consideration the availability of
limited funds at  
the disposal of U.G.C. and the fact that the 8th plan
allocations are already
