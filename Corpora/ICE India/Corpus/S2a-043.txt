<ICE-IND:S2A-043#1:1:A>
One of this <,,> that is some <,,> should know <,,> in the true 
<indig> kshatriya </indig> spirit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#2:1:A>
So here is <,,> well provided <,,> paradise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#3:1:A>
So that <,,> he need not had any <O> two words </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#4:1:A>
And he <,> could not even believe you see that is somebody <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#5:1:A>
Shailender <,> <O> one word </O> life <,> he was brought up <,,>  
within the premises of the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#6:1:A>
Gautama breathed <,,> all the sin that <,,> a younger prince should  
have <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#7:1:A>
That is on the previlege within the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#8:1:A>
The father could prepare to see <,,> that his son never went out of  
the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#9:1:A>
Once he went out of the palace <,> he would naturally can't face the  
scene <,,> the stark realities <,> of this mundane world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#10:1:A>
He detected <,,> the suffering <,,> sickness <,,> decay and death  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#11:1:A>
For about twenty or thirty-two years <,> <w> it's </w> not clearly  
mentioned <,,> Gautama lived <,,> secluded <,,> within the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#12:1:A>
When he came of age <,,> he married <,,> a princess <,> known as  
Yashodra <,,> and he had a son also by her <,,> who <}> <-> became </-> <+>  
came to be </+> </}> known as Rahul <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#13:1:A>
Now <,,> Buddha was born with a mission <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#14:1:A>
Destiny must have its own <,,> course <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#15:1:A>
And it it open at a proper time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#16:1:A>
His trusted charioteer known as Channa <,,> who had been instructed  
by the father not to take the prince <,> outside the palace premise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#17:1:A>
He requested Channa <,,> <quote> let us have a ride outside the  
palace <,> to see the world outside </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#18:1:A>
Channa <,,> he must break away the path the life of Buddha <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#19:1:A>
He reeling to his pressure <,> of the prince <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#20:1:A>
He took him outside the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#21:1:A>
Of course his <indig> wahan </indig> <,> a coach <,,> or riding  
properly on a horse <,,> chariot was going <,,> he found some people <,,>  
suffering <,,> with intense pain <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#22:1:A>
Naturally Gautama asked what is this <,,> that I see <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#23:1:A>
This is called suffering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#24:1:A>
Suffering due to various causes <,> physical <,,> mental <,,>  
psychological problems may be there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#25:1:A>
But physical suffering <,,> is the most notable one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#26:1:A>
That <,,> created impression on him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#27:1:A>
So he came back <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#28:1:A>
Taking that impression within his mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#29:1:A>
Another day <,,> when he went around <,,> the city <,,> Kapilavastu  
<,,> he saw <,,> sickness <,,> people suffering from <,> different types of  
diseases <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#30:1:A>
Buddha never knew what disease was <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#31:1:A>
So he asked his charioteer <,> <quote> what is this that I am  
seeing <,,> ? </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#32:1:A>
This is known as <,,> sickness disease <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#33:1:A>
People <,,> are subjected to various kinds of disease <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#34:1:A>
This is a second impression <,,> that Gautama had <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#35:1:A>
He comes back to palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#36:1:A>
He came over this <,,> first suffering <,,> then sickness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#37:1:A>
Then after a few days again he went he went <,> outside on his ride  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#38:1:A>
He saw an old man <,,> tottering on his walking stick <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#39:1:A>
A new sight for him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#40:1:A>
What is this <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#41:1:A>
He said it is called old age <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#42:1:A>
And everyone is subject to this old age <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#43:1:A>
The lone <,> and sinister <,> old age they may be young people who  
would have <,,> a difficult match <,,> but normally <,,> people grow <,> from  
<indig> Balavastha <O> one word </O> </indig> then <indig> praudha </indig>  
then <,,> old age <,> then <indig> dehant </indig> that is the usual  
procedure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#44:1:A>
So this is a third impression <,,> old age <,> yeah <,,> that  
Gautama had on his mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#45:1:A>
He came back <,,> to his palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#46:1:A>
Lot of tremendous disturbance was there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#47:1:A>
Seeing one after another <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#48:1:A>
Finally <,,> one day when he went out <,,> he saw <,,> a dead body  
being carried <,,> to the cremation ground <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#49:1:A>
<quote> What is this <,> ? </quote> he asked Channa <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#50:1:A>
This is called death <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#51:1:A>
Everyone <,> is <O> one word </O> died <,,> none can escape death  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#52:1:A>
What is happen <,> they should be either buried or cremated <,> and  
there is an end of his physical body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#53:1:A>
So these four impressions <,> suffering <,,> sickness <,> oldage  
<,> and death <,,> led such a strong impression on the mind of Buddha <,,>  
that he went <-> and went </-> back <,> to his palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#54:1:A>
Then he <O> one word </O> his life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#55:1:A>
I must find an answer to this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#56:1:A>
How to escape <,,> this four-fold <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#57:1:A>
Transformation <indig> siddhant </indig> <,> <O> one word </O> not  
be every one as it called <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#58:1:A>
That to turning point <,,> in the life of Buddha in the life of  
Gautama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#59:1:A>
Finally <,,> one day he decides <,,> that he <+> will </+> leave  
<,,> his hearth and home <,,> his young wife and a new born baby Rahul <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#60:1:A>
In search <,,> of that truth <,,> which will bring solace <,,> to  
humanity <,,> which will solve <,,> the problems <,> of this four kinds of  
<,,> changes that every body is subject to <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#61:1:A>
That night <,,> when he decided <,,> is called <indig> mahaesha  
</indig> <,> very significant word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#62:1:A>
He saw his wife lying on the bed <,,> took a last glance <,> at his  
wife <,,> and the child <,,> Rahula <,> also <,,> who happened to be the  
future prince <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#63:1:A>
And left <,,> the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#64:1:A>
It is said <,,> when <,,> Gautama took the decision <,,> to leave  
everything <,,> in search of truth <,,> the Jataka stories that is the  
Buddhist scriptures <,,> bore ecstacies <,,> in describing this event <,,> of  
Buddha leaving the palace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#65:1:A>
There is mentioned <,,> that God rejoiced <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#66:1:A>
Buddha leaves <,,> palace <,,> with his Channa <,,> that trusted  
charioteer <,,> to the forest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#67:1:A>
And once they enter the forest <,,> he removed all his <,,> dress  
the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#68:1:A>
Handed them over to Channa <,,> and shaved off his hair <,,> and  
wore simple clothes <,,> ordinary simple clothes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#69:1:A>
This all is a very interesting anecdote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#70:1:A>
Channa returning to the palace <,> without Buddha <,,> without  
Gautama <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#71:1:A>
But then <,> that was the <w> prince's </w> order <,> he had to  
carry <,> out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#72:1:A>
Then began <,,> the search for truth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#73:1:A>
Because he <,,> he was about thirty years of age at that time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#74:1:A>
Then <.> Buddh </.> uh Gautama left his palace <,,> he was about  
thirty years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#75:1:A>
For ten long years <,,> he underwent all kinds of austerities <,,>  
hardships <,,> privations trial and humiliations <,,> mortification of his  
own body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#76:1:A>
Subjected himself <,> to various kinds of disciplines <,,> physical  
and mental <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#77:1:A>
In this context I must tell you <,,> that Buddha <,,> was not a  
Buddhist <,,> in the sense that we understand him today <,,> because <,>  
Buddhism <,,> came into existence <,,> much later <,,> probably a couple of  
centuries later on after the demise of Buddha <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#78:1:A>
But at the time of <,,> Gautama <,,> he then lectures in religious  
schools <,,> the various systems that we have had <,,> from that on various  
<,> kinds <,,> prescribing various types of disciplines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#79:1:A>
So he goes to various teachers <,,> seeking their advise <,,> and  
subjecting himself <,,> to various kinds of disciplines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#80:1:A>
For ten long years <,,> but at the end nothing happened <,,> only  
his physical frame <,,> became emaciated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#81:1:A>
He was losing strength <,,> proper food was not given <,,> to the  
body for the maintenance of the body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#82:1:A>
Then he decides <,,> this extreme <,,> two extremes <,,> one we  
refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury <,> that  
was one extreme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#83:1:A>
So those important years <,,> he was also twenty-five years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#84:1:A>
Then in ten years <,,> subjected to himself <,,> to extreme poverty  
privation <,> trials and humiliation <,,> the other extreme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#85:1:A>
These two extreme should be avoided <,,> that realisation came to  
him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#86:1:A>
In the meantime <,,> he was wandering <,,> in search of truth <,,>  
search of illumination <,,> search of acknowledge <,,> that such a feat that  
passes or understanding <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#87:1:A>
By the time <,,> he comes <,,> to Buddha Gaya now it is known as  
Bodhgaya <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#88:1:A>
He <O> two words </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#89:1:A>
By the time he came to Bodhgaya <,,> he was about <,,> forty years  
of age <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#90:1:A>
He had decided <,,> that <,,> he will give up this two extremes  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#91:1:A>
Then <,,> he followed <,,> that one better example <,,> that is  
given to us <,,> in the <mention> Geeta </mention> <,,> in the <,,> sixth  
chapter <,,> seventeenth verse <&> A few words in sanskrit </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#92:1:A>
Food and recreation <,,> <indig> yukta </indig> should be moderated  
<,> no extremes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#93:1:A>
Not over eating <,,> hence feeling all its energy in digesting that  
food <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#94:1:A>
We know <,,> our experience tells <,,> if by chance we overeat <,,>  
how much of energy is lost <,> in digesting that food <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#95:1:A>
You feel so lazy whole day <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#96:1:A>
So long back <,> the centuries before Buddha gave <,,> on the same  
<indig> Shri </indig> Krishna has told us in the <mention> Geeta </mention>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#97:1:A>
Avoid all extremes <,,> <&> A few words in Sanskrit </&> he created  
in excessiveness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#98:1:A>
But <,> it should be moderate <,,> avoid all extremes <,,> <&> a  
few words in Sanskrit </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#99:1:A>
Even in our activity <,,> intense activity should be avoided <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#100:1:A>
And lack of activity also should be avoided <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#101:1:A>
But moderation <,> everything should be moderate <,,> that is the  
lesson <,,> that <indig> shri </indig> Krishna has given to us <,> centuries  
before <,> the time of Buddha 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#102:1:A>
<&> A few words in Sanskrit </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#103:1:A>
Even in sleep <,,> and keeping awake <&> a few words in Sanskrit  
</&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#104:1:A>
This called <indig> yoga </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#105:1:A>
Moderation never means <,,> what happens <,> it destroys all kinds  
of <indig> dukha </indig> suffering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#106:1:A>
So by the time <,,> Buddha reached <,> the present Bodhgaya <,,>  
some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago  
<,> nineteen forty-three more than fifty years now <,> I did go there <,> it  
has developed much later now <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#107:1:A>
Many new things have been added <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#108:1:A>
In the last century <,,> the whole temple was covered by a big <O>  
one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#109:1:A>
One English <,,> Collector of that district <,> it is in Bihar  
<,,> <O> two words </O> by name <,,> he just by chance he was escavating  
something he found <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#110:1:A>
The tip of a brick <,,> temple <,> and he <,> asked these people  
to remove <,> a old temple that is there in Bodhgaya <O> two words </O>  
temple <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#111:1:A>
Here if you view <,,> by the side or the back of the temple <,>  
there <-> is </-> we have a Ashoka tree <indig> peepal </indig> tree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#112:1:A>
Whether it is the same Ashoka tree <,> that <,,> Buddha meditated  
under we do not know <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#113:1:A>
It cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot  
<,,> survive <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#114:1:A>
But <,,> its descendents <,,> it has also a very these are a very  
good tree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#115:1:A>
So when I <,,> because of sentiment associated with it <,,> a few  
leaves I brought <,> from that tree <,> dry leaves that fallen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#116:1:A>
So that was again <,,> on the same <indig> vaisakha purnima  
</indig> day <,> he reached that place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#117:1:A>
In the afternoon <,,> one village dame Sujata by name brought a  
little <indig> payas </indig> for him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#118:1:A>
Buddha accepted it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#119:1:A>
We should <,,> think that Sujata is blessed <,,> because <,> she  
offered that <indig> payas </indig> <,,> to Buddha <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#120:1:A>
And that gave him some strength <,,> it is called <,,> which had  
some miracle <,> after years of mortification <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#121:1:A>
After having taken <,,> that <indig> payas </indig> <,> he comes  
to that Bodhi tree there was no temple at that time <,,> only tree was there  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#122:1:A>
He sat under the tree <,,> <w> it's </w> called the <indig> Bodhi  
vriksha </indig> <,> or Bodh tree in English it is called <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#123:1:A>
Some <,,> some descendents <,> of that <indig> Bodhi </indig> tree  
have gone in different parts <,> where ever Buddhism spread <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#124:1:A>
With deep determination he sat under the tree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#125:1:A>
One of the most glorious <,> verses that I have cone across in  
Sanskrit is this <,,> that Buddha sat under the tree <,,> with deep  
resolution <,,> having had taken that <indig> payas </indig> <,,> he sat  
under the Bodhi tree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#126:1:A>
He has an hymn <&> a few words in Sanskrit </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#127:1:A>
In this seize <,> let my body triumph <,,> and my skin bones and  
flesh <,,> may be destroyed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#128:1:A>
First a skin <&> a few words in Sanskrit </&> <,> let it be  
destroyed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#129:1:A>
<&> A few words in Sanskrit </&> untill I came <,,> that knowledge  
<,,> which is difficult <,,> <indig> durlabh </indig> <,> it has never been  
impossible <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#130:1:A>
Impossible means it can never be attained <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#131:1:A>
With a difficult <O> one word </O> that is true <,> spiritual life  
itself is difficult <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#132:1:A>
But nobody has said <quote> It is impossible </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#133:1:A>
<&> A few words in Sanskrit </&> for beyonds and beyonds people  
have rights <,> and then they have obtained <,,> until I sent that  
illumination <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#134:1:A>
<&> A few words in Sanskrit </&> I shall not budge an inch from  
this seat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#135:1:A>
This is the determination <,> with which <,> Buddha <,,> Gautama  
sat under the tree <,,> in the event <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#136:1:A>
That is the story comes <,> a whole night <,> <indig> marahans  
</indig> <,> temptations of various kinds <,> first <,> sensation <,,> then  
terror <,> they go side by side <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#137:1:A>
But <,,> no yielding <,> for any of these neither sensation nor  
terror <,,> because he had a mission to fulfill <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#138:1:A>
Gautama had to become Buddha <,> so he never afraid of <,> every  
quarter <,> <-> change </-> scene is changing <,> and <indig> mara </indig>  
became languish <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#139:1:A>
And by heard on <,,> Gautama who sat under the tree <,> became  
Buddha <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#140:1:A>
Buddha means the enlightened one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#141:1:A>
He became fully enlightened <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#142:1:A>
Now after this <,,> he starts for <,,> it is said <,> in the  
Jataka stories <,> that he got up from the seat <,,> coming round <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#143:1:A>
Now as symbolically they have made stone <,> lotuses <,,> as he  
came up from that seat <,> every step that he put <,> there was a lotus  
coming under his foot <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#144:1:A>
Until he started going <,,> out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#145:1:A>
Then starts his <,,> spiritual mission <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#146:1:A>
For forty years <,,> the first forty years <,,> with the  
twenty-five years happy luxurous life <,> marriage <,,> birth of a son <,,>  
and the determination to leave everything <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#147:1:A>
And in search of truth for ten years <,,> hard rigorous spiritual  
practices <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#148:1:A>
Then again <,,> his bodhi <,,> this illumination <,,> that happen  
<,,> on the same day <,> <indig> vaisakha purnima </indig> just exactly forty  
years later <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#149:1:A>
Five hundred and sixty <,> minus forty <,> may be about <,> five  
hundred seventy in B C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#150:1:A>
Then he went on preaching to people <,,> about this meaningless  
<,> it is <-> a </-> performing <indig> yagas shileniyas </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#151:1:A>
Because at that time <,,> <indig> parnivantkas </indig> at your  
<O> one word </O> <,> they were spending all there energy <,> in performing  
<indig> yagas shileniyas </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#152:1:A>
It is mentioned in the <mention> Vedas </mention> <&> in Sanskrit  
</&> you have a desire <,,> if you want to attained heaven <,,> you have to  
perform <indig> yaga yaga yagnya </indig> did not go to heaven <,> you have  
to perform sacrifice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#153:1:A>
But <,,> all that is meaningless <,> much later thousand year  
later from Shankara <,,> lasting life <,> refer to Shankara also who was also  
against <,,> the performance of <indig> yaga sheliniyas </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#154:1:A>
It was more after the Upanishadic way of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#155:1:A>
Buddha also comes to the same tradition <,,> same upanishadic  
tradition 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#156:1:A>
He was never against this Upanishadic tradition <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#157:1:A>
But his whole concept that is vital core <,,> what he calls  
<indig> Nirvan </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#158:1:A>
He coined a new word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#159:1:A>
In our Hindu <,> tradition also <,> we have this type of <indig>  
Brahma nirvana vrikchse </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#160:1:A>
Brahma the highest knowledge <w> it's </w> also called <indig>  
Nirvan </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#161:1:A>
If attained <indig> Brahma Nirvan </indig> such a blowing up <,,>  
because a kind of a negative concept <,> but Shankara gives us positive  
concept <,> content <,,> to this idea <,> or concept of <,> the highest  
realisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#162:1:A>
So as he was <,,> preaching <,,> men and women came <,> this is  
one notable feature in Buddhism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#163:1:A>
He made no distinction <,> of caste community race or sex <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#164:1:A>
Men and women <,,> are all accepted and became monks and nuns in  
course of time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-043#165:1:A>
Not during the time of Buddha <,> but during the late <,,> </I>
