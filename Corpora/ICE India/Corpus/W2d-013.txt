<bold> <smallcaps> IT </smallcaps> </bold> is something to be
thankful for that there are in our midst people - - pupils, admirers or
followers - - who remember musicians who have joined the great departed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#4:1>
The untimely demise of young Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar on Feb. 7 last
year was mourned by one and all as a great loss to music, to the discipline
of <indig> dhrupad </indig> in particular.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#5:1>
Faiyazuddin was one of the best exponents of <indig> Dagurbani
</indig> , one of the four principal traditions of <indig> dhrupad </indig> ,
and the most active promoter of the Delhi-based Dhrupad Society.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#6:1>
On his first death anniversary ( Feb.7) a unique concert was held
at the FICCI auditorium to pay homage to Faiyazuddin.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#7:1>
Apart from members of the Dagar family, over a dozen well-known
musicians of Delhi, some of them national celebrities, rendered vocal and
instrumental music by way of remembering Faiyazuddin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#8:1>
Had it been one of those format fulllength concerts, it would
have taken several evenings to enable all the artistes to do justice to what
they presented.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#9:1>
But, the organisers so planned the programme that it took a little
over five hours to be completed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#10:1>
It amounted to garlanding the portrait of Faiyazuddin, not with
flowers but with specimens of their music, for, nothing else was possible in
the 10 or 15 minutes allotted to each item.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#11:1>
A ritual, in effect.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#12:1>
There could be difference of opinion as to the concept of a
programme like this.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#13:1>
It would have been a better idea to present two or three items of
good music, preceded by garlanding of <w> Faiyazuddin's </w> portrait by all
the other artistes present on the occasion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#14:1>
However, the function on the whole was successful.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#15:1>
For, though the audience was small most of the time, especially
towards the end, there was an air of solemnity in the auditorium.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#16:1>
In fact, some of the instrumentalists limited their recitals to a
tranquil spell of <indig> alaap-jor </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#17:1>
( One remembered Pandit Ravi <w> Shankar's </w> <indig> alaap
</indig> in <indig> raga Gouri </indig> which he rendered in memory of Nikhil
Banerji at the Shankarlal Festival of Music, a few years ago, before
commencing his main recital). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#18:1>
The concert began with the rendition of a <indig> dhrupad
</indig> in <indig> Multani </indig> by the Dagar family, headed by the
eldest brother, Ustad Aminuddin Khan and including Ustads Zahiruddin Khan,
Rahim Fahimuddin Khan, Sayeeduddin Khan and Faiyazuddin <w> Khan's </w>
son Wasifuddin Khan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#19:1>
In quick succession thereafter a number of artistes, young and old,
presented their music in their respective styles of vocal and instrumental
music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#20:1>
They were: Shujaat Khan ( <indig> alaap </indig> in <indig> Kirwani
</indig> on the <indig> sitar </indig> ) ; Madhup Mudgal ( a <indig> madhya
teen-taal khayal </indig> in <indig> Shuddha Kalyan </indig> ) ; Usman Ali
Khan ( <indig> alaap, jor </indig> and <indig> gat </indig> in <indig>
Shivaranjani </indig> on the <indig> sitar </indig> ) ; Iqbal-Ahmed Khan
( <indig> khayal </indig> in <indig> raga Anand Shri </indig> which had a
strong flavour of <indig> Gouri </indig> ) ; Ritwick Sanyal ( <indig> dhrupad
</indig> in <indig> JogKauns </indig> ) ; Biswajeet Roy Choudhuri (
<indig> alaap </indig> and <indig> gat </indig> in <indig> Shahana </indig>
on the <indig> sarod </indig> ) ; Shubha Mudgal ( <indig> khayals </indig> in
<indig> raga Shree </indig> ) ; T. N. Krishnan ( a <indig> Thiagaraja kriti
</indig> on the violin); Sulochana Brahaspati ( <indig> dhrupad </indig> in
<indig> raga Shankara </indig> ) ; C. R. Vyas ( <indig> khayal </indig> in
<indig> Dhani </indig> ) ; Amjad Ali Khan ( <indig> alaap </indig> and
<indig> gat </indig> in <indig> Pilu </indig> on the <indig> sarod </indig> )
; Naina Devi ( <indig> thumri </indig> in <indig> Mishra Gara </indig> ) ;
Debu Chaudhuri ( <indig> alaap </indig> in <indig> Jhinjhoti </indig> on the
<indig> sitar </indig> ) ; Shafaat Ahmed Khan ( <indig> teen-taal </indig> in
<indig> tabla </indig> solo); Sheila Dhar ( <indig> khayal </indig> in
<indig> Shahana </indig> ) ; Singh <indig> Bandhu </indig> Tejpal Singh and
Surinder Singh ( <indig> khayal </indig> in <indig> Bhinna Shadja </indig> )
and Sumati Mutatkar ( Kabir <indig> bhajan </indig> in <indig> Maand </indig> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#21:1>
The concert concluded late in the evening with the vocal
recitals of Savita Devi and Lakshman Bhatt Tailang, Allauddin <w> Khan's
</w> <indig> esraj </indig> and Ustad Asad Ali <w> Khan's </w> <indig> veena
</indig> recital.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#22:1>
Many of the artistes were at their best, some of the distinguished
among them leaving many in the audience with a feeling of inadequacy in
htat they would have liked more from them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#23:1>
Such was their form and excellence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#24:1>
The vocalists were particular in choosing compositions which was
appropriate to the occassion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#25:1>
Dr. Mutatkar instantly created an aura of solemnity as she began
with <bold> <indig> Omkar Vandana </indig> </bold> before rendering the Kabir
<indig> bhajan </indig> in <indig> raga Maand </indig> , both presented with
great feeling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#26:1>
<w> Delhi's </w> leading accompanists made a rich contribution to
the success of the function.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#27:1>
Among them; Pandit Gopaldas on the <indig> pakhawaj </indig> ;
Ustads Ramzan Khan and Dayam Ali Qadri on the <indig> tabla </indig> ; Pandit
Inder Lal on the <indig> sarangi </indig> and Mahmud Dholpuri on the
harmonium. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#28:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> LISTENING </smallcaps> </bold> to the vocal
recitals in the second half of the <indig> Sahitya Kala <w> Parishad's </w>
Yuva Mahotsava </indig> last week, I felt that those who get an opportunity
<&> third column </&> to participate in such festivals must make up their
minds whether they want to be performing artistes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#29:1>
They are beginners at the moment - - with all that this implies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#30:1>
It is not enough, even if it is desirable, to obtain a high academic
degree.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#31:1>
And, although it is true that artistes, in the real sense, are born,
they are not made, yet it must be impressed upon intending young
performers that there are certain basic requirements which they have to
fulfil if they wish to perform at formal concerts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#32:1>
Among these are a good, appealing voice, confidence, which comes from
vigorous <indig> <quote> " tayyari" </quote> </indig> , precision in
<indig> swara </indig> , aesthetics, including mannerism or <indig> mudra
</indig> , a good sense of proportion as to the duration of each number,
stamina, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#33:1>
They should have enough to give to make it worthwhile for the
concert goer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#34:1>
Outstanding among the young vocalists was Neeta Mathur whose
<indig> khayals </indig> in Kalawati were well rendered.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#35:1>
Endowed with a good voice, her tunefulness at every stage of the
<indig> <w> raga's </w> </indig> delineation in the slow <indig> khayal
</indig> was commendable.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#36:1>
A pupil of wellknown vocalist Krishna Bisht, Neeta presented some
good <indig> taans </indig> as well, though in this she need greater
efficiency.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#37:1>
The Mira <indig> bhajan </indig> was pleasing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#38:1>
Making all allowance for age, the early stage of her career,
etc., Sarita <w> Pathak's </w> exposition of <indig> Puriya Kalyan </indig>
and <indig> Bahar </indig> was impressive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#39:1>
She sang with confidence, notwithstanding the occasional shaking in
her voice as she reached the upper octave.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#40:1>
Her <indig> taan </indig> patterns have the impress of her
preceptor, Mrs Sulochana Brahaspati, but I would wish her to avoid the
degree of vigour in <indig> taans </indig> , which suits the male singer more
than the female voice.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#41:1>
And, when an artiste has already made a good impression within a
certain range it becomes redundant for her - - or him - - to attempt the
farends of the third octave.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#42:1>
Sarita was a bit unsteady there in an otherwise pleasing recital.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#43:1>
Pererna <w> Chawla's </w> <indig> khayals </indig> in <indig>
Puriya Dhanashri </indig> reflected style of her mentors, Singh <}> <->
Bhandu </-> <+> Bandhu </+> </}> Tejpal Singh and Surinder Singh.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#44:1>
It was reposeful, it was systematic.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#45:1>
There were a number of good <indig> sargam taans </indig> but gteater
steadiness and precision in <indig> swara </indig> were required as she
progressed into the upper octave.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#46:1>
If she had judiciously curtailed the embellishments in her <indig>
khayals </indig> in the opening number, she would have had more time for the
well rendered composition in <indig> Hamsadhwani </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#47:1>
She should gain confidence with the passage of time. </p> </I>

<bold> <smallcaps> MUSICOLOGISTS </smallcaps> </bold> and speakers
go eloquent on the efficacy of the <indig> gurukula </indig> system of
imparting musical education and give clarian calls for reviving it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#51:2>
But facts seem to prove that the <indig> gurukula </indig> , like
many other aspects of classical music, is an over-rated and over-mystified
issue.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#52:2>
Some of the greatest musicians of the recent past like GNB and Veena
Balachander were not <indig> gurukulites </indig> , and among the many who
did <indig> gurukulavasam </indig> under Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar only an
Ariyakkudi made a mark as an acclaimed performer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#53:2>
Another similar proof was there for the Delhities to see in the grand
Swati Tirunal festival organised by <indig> Swaralaya </indig> at the
cultural department of the USSR Embassy Auditorium, last week. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#54:2>
Two disciples who learnt from Ariyakkudi in the <indig> gurkula
</indig> tenets were featured in the festival.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#55:2>
There was an ocean of difference inthe quality of the music of the
two - - K. V. Narayanswamy and B. Rajam Iyer - - both of them sexagenarians.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#56:2>
The latter is said to be the senior disciple but his performance was
nowhere near the great music heard in the concerts of the former.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#57:2>
According to many in the audience K. V. Narayanaswamy was in a top
form not come across in his visit to Delhi in recent years.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#58:2>
Even when not at his best KVN is known for his high sensitiveness and
refined aesthetic approach to music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#59:2>
The <indig> Atatala Varnam </indig> in <indig> Sankarabharanam
</indig> and the other <indig> Swathi Tirunal </indig> compositions ( <indig>
Paripalaya, Saroruhasana </indig> ) seemed to achieve a new high status in
his hands.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#60:2>
Micro-tonal purity of a very high order was maintained throughout.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#61:2>
On the other hand, B. Rajam Iyer sounded raw both in sound and
knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#62:2>
Credit is, of course, due for his rendition of the beautiful songs
like <w> Dikshitar's </w> <indig> Sri Sundararajam </indig> in <indig>
pantuvarali </indig> and <w> Swati's </w> <indig> Srikumara ( Atana) </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#63:2>
He could somehow hit at <indig> Tara shadja </indig> correctly
everytime but the inadequacies in other nuances were too many, his <indig>
nishadam </indig> in <indig> Keeravani </indig> for instance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#64:2>
Students and listeners of music in Delhi are used to a very high
standard in pallavis and Rajam <w> Iyer's </w> pedestrian Pallavi, even in
which he stumbled while negotiating <indig> tisram </indig> , was bland and
dragging.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#65:2>
Like all other aging musicians with sagging vocal chords he resorted
to unwarranted speeches in between and tried to gain sympathy of the
listeners.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#66:2>
<indig> Swaralaya </indig> could have used the good forum for
presenting a more deserving youngster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#67:2>
<w> Sivaraman's </w> <indig> Mridangam </indig> accompaniment
was superb.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#68:2>
Only a maestro like him could have so effectively heightened the
aesthetic appeal of <w> KVN's </w> music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#69:2>
Nagarajan collaborated admirably on the <indig> Kanjira </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#70:2>
One of the most purposeful and appealing classical music
programme of recent times was telecast last Sunday night.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#71:2>
It was on the eve of saint <w> Tyagaraja's </w> birth-day and <indig>
ghanaraga pancharatna kritis </indig> were presented with a difference, sans
the usual chaos and clashes of versions heard at Tiruvaiyaru and other
festivals.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#72:2>
The instrumentalists playing the <indig> swarams </indig> and the
vocalists singling the <indig> sahityam </indig> was a welcome novelty.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#73:2>
The <indig> Varali </indig> piece never sounded so musical.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#74:2>
Luck of synchronisation between the audio and vedio versions was too
obvious in certain places like Dudukugala.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#75:2>
In sum, it was an excellent programme for producing which Subbudu,
the verteran penman of versatile capabilities, deserves kudos. </p> </I>

Abhisheki's </w> vocal recital on Wednesday evening under the auspices of
<indig> Sangeetanjali </indig> at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan was marked for
profundity which invariably is the hallmark of his performances.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#79:3>
The audience, though admiring, was small, but that made no
difference to the <w> maestro's </w> serious approach to what he presented,
despite a slight voice problem at he outset.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#80:3>
It must also be put down to the credit of the organisers and the
artiste alike that they did not wait for the hall to be filled by a
sizeable audience, and punctually started the programme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#81:3>
Of the string of <indig> khayals </indig> that he rendered the
two that impressed most were the <indig> vilambit </indig> and <indig> drut
</indig> compositions in <indig> Poorva </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#82:3>
It is a many-faceted, difficult evening melody.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#83:3>
It has a bit of <indig> Gouri </indig> , a bit of <indig> Basant
</indig> and the morning <indig> Ramkali </indig> , but his delineation of
the raga in the slow <indig> khayal </indig> was very well coordinated, so
that its main features were not lost.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#84:3>
And, if the <indig> vilambit </indig> composition had a systematic
<indig> badhat </indig> , full of repose, the <indig> drut khayal </indig>
was embellished with some vigorous <indig> taans </indig> and impressive,
rhythemic <indig> bol-taans </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#85:3>
The recital commenced with a slow <indig> ek-taal khayal </indig>
in <indig> Madhuvanti </indig> with an occasional use of <indig> komal nishad
</indig> ; at times prominent, at times subdued.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#86:3>
It is a part of <w> Abhisheki's </w> style, following his preceptor,
Pandit Jagannath Bua Purohit, that every key note of a <indig> raga </indig>
must have clarity, in whatever combination.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#87:3>
The sweet <indig> drut teen-taal khayal ( <quote> " suna piya araj ab
mori..." </quote> ) </indig> was followed by an equally brisk <indig>
tarana </indig> in the same <indig> taal </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#88:3>
Many vocalists now present <indig> ragas </indig> in three parts,
consisting of two <indig> khayals </indig> and a <indig> tarana </indig> ,
which, if not carefully divided timewise, leads to an undue extension of
that particular number.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#89:3>
In this case, however, the timing was proportionately divided.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#90:3>
Normally, it is always better to present only two <indig> khayals
</indig> or a <indig> khayal </indig> and a <indig> tarana </indig> in place
of the <indig> drut khayal </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#91:3>
<indig> Poorva </indig> was followed by a <indig> Raskhan bhajan
</indig> based on <indig> Bhimpalasi </indig> and immediately after that
the rendered two <indig> khayals </indig> in <indig> Nayaki Kanhara </indig>
- - all well presented, though it was a rather odd arrangement, especially as
there was no intermission.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#92:3>
The <indig> drut </indig> compositon had Urdu lyrics; a composition
of Delhi <indig> Gharana </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#93:3>
The concluding <indig> Surdas bhajan </indig> was soulful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#94:3>
<w> Abhisheki's </w> pupil Hemant Pendse provided excellent vocal
support while Manomohan <w> Singh's </w> <indig> tabla </indig> and Om <w>
Prakash's </w> harmonium accompaniments added lustre to the recital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#96:4>
<bold> <smallcaps> BHAJAN </smallcaps> </bold> Sopori is one of the
leading <indig> santoor </indig> players who have brought this ancient,
100-string instrument into prominence during the last 20 years.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#97:4>
He has, besides, successfully experimented with innovations in its
structure, which create greater scope for embellishments.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#98:4>
<indig> Santoor </indig> has its limitations; tonal and other
limitations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#99:4>
But, depending on the skill of the artiste, these are overcome to a
considerable extent because of the innovations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#100:4>
Instead of the original one and half octaves bhajan has introduced
in it full three octaves, extending the scope of play as a <indig> raga
</indig> or composition is developed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#101:4>
The introduction of a <indig> <quote> " tumba" </quote> </indig>
provides the traditional <indig> asana </indig> to the artiste, and adds
to resonance which is essential to any string instrument of this kind.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-013#102:4>
At the <mention> Press Club of India </mention> concert last
weekend ( it was more of an oldstyle <indig> mehfil </indig> than a formal
public concert) <w> Bhajan's </w> exposition of <indig> Rageshri </indig>
produced delightful music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#103:4>
It was a judicious choice, for, between <indig> Bageshri </indig>
and <indig> Rageshri </indig> the latter is more suited for <indig> santoor
</indig> , even though Bhajan did execute a few impressive <indig> meends
</indig> in the lower octave.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#104:4>
Through a 40 mnute <indig> a laap, jor, jhala </indig> sequence of a
superior order the <indig> raga </indig> was presented in great detail,
the nuances rendered at times sharply, at times subtly, making excellent
use of the vibration that particular strokes created.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#105:4>
Then there were three <indig> gats </indig> in slow <indig>
jhap-taal, drut ek-taal </indig> and <indig> ati-drut teen-taal </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#106:4>
After a thorough <indig> alaap-jor </indig> spell Bhajan did not
make the mistake of opening the <indig> gat </indig> series in the <indig>
<quote> " ati-vilambit" </quote> teen-taal </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#107:4>
Many artistes quite often make that mistake.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#108:4>
And, <indig> jhap-taal </indig> was used in the ideal tempo, between
slow and medium.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#109:4>
All the three compositions were marked for a variety of <indig>
gattodas </indig> , rich in music and rhythmic beauty made more so by
young Akram <w> Khan's </w> able <indig> tabla </indig> accompaniment.

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#110:4>
There was perfect understanding between the two, and Bhajan
offered him ample opportunity for turns at solo which were well utilised,
evoking audience appreciation in many rounds.

Tunefulness was another prominent feature of the opening number;
and, in all the three octaves, including the third in which Bhajan touched
notes up to the <indig> dhaivat </indig> with commendable accuracy. </p>

The next <indig> raga </indig> was <indig> Kirwani </indig> ,
again a suitable melody for <indig> santoor </indig> , in which too, three
<indig> gats </indig> were played after a brief <indig> alaap </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-013#113:4>
The emphasis in this number was on varied rhythmic patterns with
crisp, short <indig> taankari </indig> , the <indig> taal </indig> cycles
being the seven-beat <indig> roopak </indig> , followed by one in five and
half beats and another in eight and half beats, all well managed with
adequate response from accompanist Akram Khan. </p> </I>
