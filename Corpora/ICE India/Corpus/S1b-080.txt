The meeting was schedule to have <,,> <}> <-> schedule to be </->
<+> been </+> </}> held at <,> ten thirty <,,> but ten thirty <,,> we had
only fifteen member <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#3:1:A>
So therefore <,,> the meeting has to be adjourned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#4:1:A>
And now held <,> after half an hour eleven <w> O'clock </w> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#5:1:A>
Normally <,,> many people may not know <,,> <w> proxy's </w>
attenders <,,> and the members attenders <,,> together is counted <,,> so far
as the quorum is concerned

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#6:1:A>
That is the <,,> normal <,,> practice <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#7:1:A>
But still <,,> we wanted to wait <,,> for the members <,,> if
somebody is delayed or held up <,> these days the trains are not regular <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#8:1:A>
Or they may be coming from long distances <,,>

So therefore <,,> we waited for half an hour <,> and I must thank
you <,,> for the patience <,> and specially lot of <w> proxy's </w> <,,>
members have come <,,> and uh <,,> perhaps they may be <,> feeling little <,>

Let me tell you <,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#X97:1:C>
<O> One word </O> donation of <O> one word </O> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#98:1:C>
Anybody giving donation we are giving receipt <,> <w> that's
</w> the one thing <,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#X99:1:C>
<O> A few words </O> </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#100:1:C>
No <,> let me make it very clear <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#101:1:C>
We are not taking any donation <,,> from the parents <,> for
admission of the children <,,> to the school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#102:1:C>
We are taking the donation <,,> from anybody <,,> parents <,>
students <,> well wishers <,,> uh connected unconnected anybody <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#103:1:C>
Whenever we take any donation <,> we issue the receipt <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#X104:1:C>
<O> One or two words </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#105:1:C>
Every donor is given a receipt <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#106:1:B>
See we continously collect <,> uh donations <,> irrespective
of their status <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#107:1:B>
And then we issue the receipts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#108:1:B>
Now <,> uh we have uh always tried to maintain <,> cordial
relations with the parents <,,> and uh often <,> uh our English medium
parents <,> they are more alert and active than <,> uh the parents of the
Kannada <,,> school <,,> because they come from the economically higher
strata in the society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#109:1:B>
And uh <,> they <-> are </-> also often give us suggestions and
ideas <,> to improve the working of the school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#110:1:B>
And we always accept their suggestions if they are <,,> uh uh
academically sound <,> and financially feasible to implement uh <,> these
ideas and suggestions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#111:1:B>
Now sometime of course the <,> uh the parents may say that we need
<,> uh more time for childrens to play and <,> uh Badminton court <,> and
such suggestions are also made <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#112:1:B>
But they are not within uh uh you see our <,> abilities for the
time being <,> but the point is that we too <,> uh meet <,> and we had
recently <,,> about uh <,,> three <}> <-> <.> we </.> </-> <=> weeks </=>
</}> back <,,> in the month of November we had a meeting uh <,> of the junior
uh K G K G section and primary <,> and subsequently after a week <,> on the
twenty <,> uh seventh of November <,> we had a meeting with the <,> uh
parents of English secondary school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#113:1:B>
Uh we have tried in the past six years <,> though not this year
<,> to have a meeting of the parents of Kannada <,> uh teach Kannada school

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#114:1:B>
But <,> uh response has been very <,,> limited and therefore we
didn't try

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#115:1:B>
But next year <,> we will also have the meeting <,> uh of the
Kannada parents <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#116:1:B>
Now <,> Mr Chairman I had received <,,> a letter <,,> addressed by
Keshavrao <,,> of fourteen points <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#117:1:B>
This is within his right because

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#118:1:A>
He is a member

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#119:1:B>
He is a member and we had printed if you have any question on
report <,> you should raise it in writing three days before <,> he has sent
the <,,> letter <,> and I had prepared the answers <,> but he is not uh
present <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#120:1:C>
<w> I'll </w> ask the Secretary to hurriedly <,,> uh uh mean
inform the members <,> what were the questions <,> and we may give the reply
that is understood <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#121:1:B>
Now he had pointed out <,> uh two mistakes in the report and
uh <,> these mistakes are uh accepted that uh <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#122:1:C>
Printed mistake

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#123:1:B>
Printers mistake <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#124:1:B>
The notice says nineteen ninety <{1> <[1> two </[1> ninety-four
<,> it should be read as <{2> <[2> uh ninety-three </[2> ninety-four <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#125:1:C>
<[1> Two </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#126:1:C>
<[2> Ninety-three </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#127:1:C>
Budget

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#128:1:B>
And uh <,> wherever <,> we are told <,> appears in the <,>
<w> I'm </w> sorry wherever English school appears <,> it should be read as
<,> B R <O> one word </O> English High School <w> we've </w> not mentioned
some places <,> B R <O> one word </O> he wanted us to be specific <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#129:1:B>
And uh he wanted to know <,> why there are only three <,> uh
school committee meetings uh from uh <,> in the English medium <,> while
there are six school committee meetings in Kannada medium <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#130:1:B>
My reply to <,> that is <,> uh initiative to call the meetings
entirely lies with the <,> <{> <[> Headmistress <,> Head Mistresses of the
respective school <,> and uh possibly the H M of English school has uh <,> uh
felt that uh <,,> many meetings were not required

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#131:1:B>
However <w> we've </w> already <,> told the H M of English medium
school <,> to call the meetings more often <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#132:1:C>
<[> Headmistress </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-080#133:1:B>
Then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous <,> uh
meetings of the school committee on the same day <,> so that there will be
equal uh number of uh meetings <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#134:1:B>
Uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because <,,> <->
the </-> most of the members of the committee from the management side are
honorary <,> and they can't spend uh <,> three four hours at a stretch in the
school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#135:1:B>
So meetings have to be on different uh <,> days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#136:1:B>
Then there was a question why there is a separate <,> uh uh <}>
<-> Head <.> Ma </.> </-> <=> Head Mistress </=> </}> for English primary
<,,> and why there is no separate Head Mistress for uh Kannada <,> primary
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#137:1:B>
My reply to that <,> uh uh as you know <,> Kannada primary has a
very small strength <,,> and English primary has more than four hundred <,>
under the rules <,> we cannot have uh <,> separate Head Mistress for uh <,>
Kannada primary and therefore Kannada primary is looked after by the <,>
Secondary <}> <-> Head <.> mas </.> </-> <=> Head Mistress </=> </}> without
any extra remuneration <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#138:1:B>
He has also asked why <,> uh Junior College uh is also looked
after by <,> the Head Mistress of Kannada High School <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#139:1:B>
Answer to that is very simple <,> that uh <,> the Junior College
is the extension of the Kannada High School <,> and under the rules we cannot
appoint a separate person to <,> the Junior College <,> the Head Mistresses
had to look after that also <,> and under the rule she is <,> uh given by the
government not by the management <,> uh an additional honorarium of hundred
<indig> rupees </indig> <,> which she has been getting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#140:1:B>
Now <,,> he wanted to know how often the various <,> sub-
committees are met <,> uh my answer to that is maintenance committee has <->
meant </-> <,> uh met number of times <,> to maintain the building <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#141:1:B>
Health committee <}> <-> <.> ha </.> </-> <=> has </=> </}>
attended to all the health problems arising <,> in the schools <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#142:1:B>
They <,> uh fund raising committee has raised the funds <,> uh in
the last six years <,> at different times <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#143:1:B>
And <,> therefore the sub-committees are doing uh <,> their
functions properly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#144:1:B>
Uh <,> how many life members were enrolled that is uh <,> the
question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#145:1:B>
The report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life
member because we <,> have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen
seventy-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#146:1:B>
And that is uh reason why <w> we've </w> brought the amendments in
the <,> extra ordinary general uh meeting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#147:1:B>
Now he wanted to know <,> uh the forty-seven children studying in
Kannada <,> uh studying Kannada in English medium school whether they are
outsiders or <,> uh insiders

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#148:1:B>
They are our own children <,> studying in Kannada <,> in English
medium <,> but because their parents are from Karnatak <,> they want Kannada
to be <,> taught and <w> we've </w> made <,> voluntary provision for teaching
of <,> uh Kannada in the English medium school

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#149:1:B>
There is no compulsion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-080#150:1:B>
Similarly <w> we've </w> also <,> uh introduced uh on a voluntary
basis computer education <,> for which <,> uh separate fees are charged <,>
and uh <,> this is <,,> provided by on a voluntary basis uh they pay <,> and
<O> one word </O> Automation company is providing the education <,> and
therefore the <mention> Mandal </mention> <,> is not directly involved in the
<,> uh uh computer education <,> except providing room for computers to be
placed <,,> </I>
