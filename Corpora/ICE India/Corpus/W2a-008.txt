<ICE-IND:W2A-008#4:1>
<it> <mention> A River Sutra </mention> </it> is Gita <w> Mehta's
</w> third novel, the other two being <it> <mention> Karma Cola </mention>
</it> and <it> <mention> Raj </mention> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#5:1>
While the first two novels are in the well-known comic-ironic mode,
this novel can be said to be roughly, in the allegorical mode.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#6:1>
Further, one wonders whether <it> <mention> A River Sutra </mention>
</it> can be called a novel at all.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#7:1>
Having the Western <it> <mention> Don Quixote </mention> </it> and the
Indian <it> Dasakumara Charitha </it> as its models <it> <mention> The River
Sutra </mention> </it> exploits the formal possibilities of the genre to the
fullest.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#8:1>
It is a framed narrative.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#9:1>
It is the story of an I.A.S. Officer, who, after retirement, chooses
to be the manager of a Guest House, on the banks of the Narmada river in the
Vindhya range.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#10:1>
Since at this spot, there are pilgrimage centres of Hindus, Jains,
Buddhists and Muslims, the manager constantly comes across many pilgrims;
and, occasionally, the pilgrims tell him their strange / tragic tales.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#11:1>
The novel, after the preamble, begins with <quote> " The <w> Monk's
</w> Story" </quote> , and ends with <quote> " The Song of the Narmada"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#12:1>
In all there are seven inset-stories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#13:1>
Although ancient Indian aestheticians were content to distinguish
between <it> <mention> Katha </mention> </it> and <it> <mention> Akhyayika
</mention> </it> on the basis of who the narrator is, and didn't explore the
narrative further, <sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp> <O> <&> page </&> 2 </O> if we
bring together such long narratives as <it> <mention> Kathasaritsagara,
Panchatantra, Kadambari </mention> </it> and <it> <mention> Dasakumara
Charita </it> </mention> . we can construct an Indian narrative tradition and
identify its constituents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#14:1>
To start with, all Indian narratives - - be they epics like <it>
<mention> Mahabaratha </mention> </it> , fiction such as <it> Kadambari </it>
, or folk-narratives like <it> <mention> Vethal Panchavimshati </mention>
</it> -  are framed narratives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#15:1>
In fact, the strategy of <quote> ` framing' </quote> seems to be
essentially oriental, which reached Europe during the Middle Ages through
Arabic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#16:1>
Many of <w> Boccaccio's </w> and <w> Chaucer's </w> tales have been
traced back to India. <sp> <fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#17:1>
Often there is a <quote> ` double or triple framing' </quote> . <sp>
<fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#18:1>
Secondly, the narrative mode in the Indian ( or Oriental ) tradition
is non-realistic and fantastic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#19:1>
Thirdly, the framed stories are often variations of certain broad
human experiences, no attempt being made to particularise either the
characters or incidents in time and space.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#20:1>
In fact, almost all narratives can be said to be variations played on
a few archetypal patterns of human behaviour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#21:1>
In a framed narrative, the frame could be passive or dynamic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#22:1>
A passive frame is one which functions only as a mechanical link
among the diverse stories ( as in <it> Decameron </it> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#23:1>
On the other hand, in a dynamic frame, there is constant mediation
between the frame and the inset stories; each qualifying and commenting on
the other ( as in <w> Chaucer's </w> <it> <mention> Canterbury Tales
</mention> </it> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#24:1>
Again, a dynamic frame may function as a counterpoint to the inset
stories, providing the work multiplicity of point of view or polyphony to use
<w> Bakhtin's </w> term <sp> <fnr> 4 </fnr> </sp> ( as in <w> Boll's </w>
<it> The Lost Honour of Katherina Bloom </it> .)

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#25:1>
Or, the frame may provide a specific spatio-temporal context, as A.K.
Ramanujan argues, <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr> </sp> to the inset story / stories ( as
in <it> <mention> The Hand <w> Maid's </w> Tale </mention> </it> .) </p> <O>
<&> page </&> 3 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#26:1>
Generally, frames in Indian narratives are passive; they just
serve to bring together assorted stories.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#27:1>
Only in the case of <it> <mention> Panchatantra </mention> </it> ,
the frame has some dynamism in it : the five princes who are told the various
stories learn something from each story and at the end their maturation is
complete.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#28:1>
From this point of view the frame in <it> <mention> A River Sutra
</mention> </it> is both functional and dynamic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#29:1>
The narrator in the frame, the retired bureaucrat, isn't a
know-all wise man.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#30:1>
Often, he doesn't either understand a tale told him or only partially
understands it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#31:1>
After listening to the first tale ( <quote> ` The <w> Monk's </w>
Story' </quote> ) he is <quote> ` disturbed' </quote> ; and discusses the
meaning of the story with his older friend Tariq Mia.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#32:1>
Even Tariq <w> Mia's </w> explanation ( that <quote> " the human
heart has only one secret, the capacity to love" </quote> p. 48 ) is beyond
his comprehension.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#33:1>
Similarly, after listening to the second story, the frame-narrator is
perplexed and angry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#34:1>
He tells the readers: <quote> " I was upset by the old <w> Mulla's
</w> accusation that I did not understand the World" </quote> ( p.92).

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#35:1>
Sometimes, even Mr. Chagla, his assistant, appears to be more
knowledgeable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#36:1>
When Mr. Chagla states, as if he is stating the obvious, that <quote>
" without desire there is no life" </quote> , the framenarrator is
baffled.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#37:1>
<quote> " I stared at him in astonishment" </quote> , he adds ( p.
142 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#38:1>
The point to be noticed here is that the frame-narrator also
grows as the novel progresses.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#39:1>
In fact, from one point of view, he could be considered the centre
around whom and whose process of perception and understanding of men and
society, the entire novel revolves.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#40:1>
When the novel begins, he is a <indig> <quote> ` Vana prasthi'
</quote> </indig> , and he is determined to be totally detached from the
world, from the elevated position of self-assumed wisdom.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#41:1>
But at the end, his older friend, Tariq Mia tells him : <quote> "
Destiny is playing tricks on you.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#42:1>
Don't you realize you were brought here to gain the world, not
forsake it ? " </quote> ( p. 228 )

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#43:1>
The retired bureaucrat is annoyed and claims that he knows the world
well enough.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#44:1>
Later, however, he realizes that still he is groping in the dark:
<quote> " I <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O> started at the flashes of illumination,
wondering for the first time what I would do if I ever left the Bungalow"
</quote> ( p. 282 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#45:1>
More importantly, what is to be stressed in the structuring of
the novel is its multiple focalisation. <sp> <fnr> 6 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#46:1>
Tariq Mia, the friend-philosopher of the main narrator, is also
limited in his grasp of men and matters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#47:1>
In fact, there is no single character in the novel whose knowledge of
the world is not imparfect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#48:1>
Each tale, narrated from a limited point of view, is later discussed,
analysed and commented upon, again in their limited comprehension, by the two
frame characters, who share a sort of teacher-pupil relationship.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#49:1>
In other words, the novelist here, consciously, seems to adapt the
framework of the Upanishads-the pupil sitting close to the teacher and
entering into a dialogue with him.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#50:1>
In the very beginning of the novel, the writer underscores this
point, making here principal narrator say : <quote> " Do you know what the
word <mention> Upanishad </mention> means?

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#51:1>
It means to sit beside and listen.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#52:1>
Here I am, sitting, eager to listen." </quote> ( p. 13 ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#53:1>
Now, coming to the framed tales, each of the seven tales is
designed as a variation on the single theme of <quote> ` attachment.'
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#54:1>
While the frame-narrator is one who has renounced the world, the
first inset-story is of the heir to an international diamond merchant, who
also resolves ( following the model of Mahavira ) to renouce the world,
yearning to be free from the world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#55:1>
But, after becoming a Jain Monk, having renounced every possession,
he realises he has newer bonds with the world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#56:1>
After narrating his tale, he states, he has to hurry and join his
brother monks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#57:1>
<quote> " I am too poor to renounce the world twice" </quote> , he
admits ( p. 41 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#58:1>
And this admission bewilders the principal narrator.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#59:1>
The succeeding tales also, similarly, play off the themes of <quote>
` attachmentdetachment.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#60:1>
Whereas passionate attachment leads to tragic consequences in the
<quote> ` <w> Teacher's </w> Story' </quote> and <quote> ` The <w>
Executive's </w> Story', ` The <w> Musician's </w> Story' </quote> and
<quote> ` The <w> Minstrel's </w> Story' </quote> uphold detachment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#61:1>
But again the last story - - <quote> ` The Song of the Narmada'
</quote> - - registers the futility of detachment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#62:1>
The Naga Baba returns to the world as an archaeologist and undertake
Narmada excavations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#63:1>
In other words, each tale <O> <&> page </&> 5 </O> either contradicts
or qualifies the implications of the earlier tale/s ( as in <it> <mention>
Canterbury Tales </mention> </it> ) ; and all the insettales are qualified
by the frame.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#64:1>
Consequently, what we get at the end of the novel is a multiple
vision of the <quote> ` many-coloured dome' </quote> - - Life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#65:1>
The vision of life implied by the totality of the text is a
paradoxical position of both <quote> ` attachment-detachment.' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#66:1>
The frame and a few inset-stories mount a serious critique of
attachment to the world in the form of wealth, power and sensual indulgence.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#67:1>
While the principle narrator is sick of a highly placed <w>
bureaucrat's </w> life and voluntarily becomes a <quote> ` Vanaprastha'
</quote> , the narrator of the <quote> ` <w> Executive's </w> Story' </quote>
is even more critical.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#68:1>
He observes in his diary that he and his <quote> ` estate boys'
</quote> , in their drinking, gambling and wenching, indulged in <quote> "
Careless self-destruction." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#69:1>
Similarly the singer in <quote> " The <w> Musician's </w> Story"
</quote> , transforms her unrequited love to the love of divine music.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#70:1>
However, the novel rejects the concept of total detachment as
well.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#71:1>
At one point, Mr. Chagla gravely states to the frame-narrator:
<quote> " But, Sir, without desire there is no life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#72:1>
Everything will stand still.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#73:1>
Become emptiness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#74:1>
In fact, Sir, be dead" </quote> ( p. 142 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#75:1>
Prof. Shankar alias Naga Baba declares towards the end, dismissing
the divinity of the river Narmada : <quote> " If anything is sacred about the
river, it is the individual experiences of the human beings who have lived
here" </quote> ( p. 267 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#76:1>
Such profound affirmation of life and human experience is
reinforced by repeated motifs of love and rebirth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#77:1>
The allusions to the penance of Uma to achieve <w> Shiva's </w> love,
to the five arrows of <indig> Kama ( Panchasayaka) </indig> which none can
withstand, to the death of <indig> Kama ( Kamadahana) </indig> which makes
<w> Kumara's </w> birth possible, to the origins of <indig> Veena </indig>
created by Shiva to immortalize <w> Uma's </w> immortal beauty, to the seven
notes of music which are all drawn from Nature-all these allusions indirectly
uphold the divinity of love, and conjugal bliss.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#78:1>
The lyrics of the great Sufi poet Rumi, quoted here and there
appropriately, again strengthen this motif - - of love, both human and
divine.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#79:1>
In fact, the entire novel, <it> <mention> The River Sutra </mention>
</it> , is a fascinating mosaic of rich and <O> <&> page </&> 6 </O>
repetitive images, motifs, and allusions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#80:1>
What places the novel at the centre of Indian narrative tradition
is that each inset story seems to have been selected and elaborated with an
awareness of the Indian <indig> Rasa </indig> theory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#81:1>
For instance, the <w> Monk's </w> story, based on renunciation,
has <quote> ` Shanta' </quote> as its <indig> Sthayi </indig> , and <indig>
Karuna </indig> as <indig> Sanchari rasas </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#82:1>
The <w> Teacher's </w> story, centred on greed and jealousy, evokes
<indig> Bhibhatsa </indig> and concommitant <indig> Karuna </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#83:1>
While the <w> Courtesan's </w> story evokes <indig> Sringara </indig>
and <indig> Vira </indig> , the <w> Executive's </w> story <indig> Adbhuta
</indig> and <indig> Hasya </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#84:1>
While <indig> Vipralambha Sringara </indig> and <indig> Karuna
</indig> are communicated through the <w> Teacher's </w> story, <indig>
Adbhuta </indig> and <indig> Karuna </indig> dominate the <w> Ministrel's
</w> story.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#85:1>
It is appropriate from this point of view that the <w> novel's </w>
title is partially Indian: the River <quote> ` Sutra' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#86:1>
The all-pervasive central symbol in the novel is the river
Narmada.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#87:1>
The novel captures her varied moods from varying angles.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#88:1>
The river, born in the Vindhyas and flowing west-wards, is the
meeting point of all the central characters in the climatic moments of their
lives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#89:1>
She is the <quote> " Delightful one" </quote> , <quote> " forever
holy, forever inexhaustible." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#90:1>
If sometimes she appears as a bride, flowing to meet her bridegroom,
the ocean with all ardour, some other times she has the allurement of a
whore.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#91:1>
In fact, as Dr. Mitra explains to the bureaucrat, <quote> ` narmada'
</quote> in Sanskrit, also means <quote> ` a whore' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#92:1>
What interests Dr. Shankar, the archaeologist, in Narmada is not that
it is a <quote> ` holy' </quote> river but that it is an immortal river.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#93:1>
That is, <quote> " the Narmada has never changed its course.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#94:1>
What we are seeing today is the same river that was seen by the
people who lived here a hundred thousand years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#95:1>
To me such a sustained record of human presence in the same
place-that is immortality" </quote> ( p.264 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#96:1>
The cave drawings in the vicinity of Narmada are among he <quote> "
oldest evidence of human life in India." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#97:1>
The ancient Alexandrian geographer, Ptolemy, wrote about the Narmada.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#98:1>
Vyasa is supposed to have dictated his Mahabharatha on this river
bank and <w> Kalidasa's </w> works graphically describe the river and the
nearby Vindya range.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#99:1>
<quote> " It is as if reason and instinct are constantly warring on
the banks of the Narmada.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#100:1>
I mean, even the war between the Aryans and the pre-Aryans is <O>
<&> page </&> 7 </O> still unresolved here" </quote> ( p. 153 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-008#101:1>
Obviously, Narmada symbolises Life in general, and Indian
culture and society in particular.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#102:1>
The river, with Shiva and Supaneshwara temples on one side, the
Muslim mosque and the tomb of the Sufi poet, Rumi, on the other and many
Jain, Buddhist and tribal temples and shrines scattered over its course,
symbolises the culture that is both ancient and modern, both monotheistic and
theistic, and both Aryan and non-Aryan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-008#103:1>
In fact, <it> The River Sutra </it> could as well have been titled
<quote> ` Bharath Sutra' </quote> . </p>
