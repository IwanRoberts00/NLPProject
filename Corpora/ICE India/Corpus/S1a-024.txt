<ICE-IND:S1A-024#85:1:A>
When did you start teaching <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#86:1:C>
Actually <,,> after I finished my <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#87:1:B>
MA

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#88:1:C>
MA <,> I joined uh <,> tutorial college

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#89:1:A>
Uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#90:1:C>
I was working there for about uh <,> four years

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#91:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#92:1:C>
Then afterwards <,> I joined uh <,,> CBSE

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#93:1:A>
CBSE school

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#95:1:A>
At Kottagali <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#96:1:C>
Then after that in nineteen eight-five <,,> I came to a
government aided school <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#97:1:C>
Then from government aided school <,> I switched over to <,> <{>
<[> government </[> school

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#98:1:A>
<[> Government </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#99:1:A>
How is the teaching in a government school ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#100:1:A>
Normally they say its standard is <,> lower students are not very
<,> how is it <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#101:1:C>
Uh <,> standard because it depends upon the as you know this
socio <,> environmental <,,> cultural <,> uh region <,> because uh people
from <,> well most uh <,> poverty stricken area <,> are uh <,> <w> they're
</w> not well educated they are not from well educated family <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#102:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the problem <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#103:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#104:1:A>

twenty-seven <w> it's </w> time to marry

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#109:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#110:1:C>
You know do you think that marriage <,,> uh after marriage
you cannot relax

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#111:1:B>

more responsibilities

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#112:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#120:1:B>
No we can have company no in our group

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#121:1:A>

married man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#122:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#123:1:C>
Uh yeah talk about this uh marriage and uh <,,> celibacy

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#124:1:C>

life <,> is it ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#131:1:B>
Very good you are the one exception <,> you are the only one

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#132:1:C>
Oh sir I didn't <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#133:1:C>
There are difficulties and uh problems <,> start only when you <{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#134:1:A>
<[> Problems </[> </{>

when we have children <O> one word </O> children to take care of

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#136:1:C>
There are lots of problems but yet <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#137:1:A>

many problems

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#143:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#144:1:C>
So many problems and then so many expenses

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#145:1:C>
The problems are there but also <,,> there are pleasures in the
married life <,> in the family life <,> whereas in <,> celibacy <,,> you
don't get pleasures <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#146:1:C>
That you can remain <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#147:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#151:1:B>
I am not tied I am free

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#152:1:C>
Yes <{> <[> no problems </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#153:1:A>
<[> I think there is uh </[> </{> this <,> there is the
pleasure in sharing in life

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#154:1:B>
Sharing it with some one else

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#155:1:C>
Companion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#156:1:B>
I am sharing my thoughts ideas with you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#157:1:A>
Yeah and when you get married <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#158:1:A>
You come into a close relations and uh <,> connections with so
many <,> uh relations of uh <,> on your side on your <{> <[> <w> wife's </w>
side </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#159:1:C>
<[> From <w> wife's </w> side </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#160:1:A>
So many people <,,> coming to contact with you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#161:1:A>
And you face a <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#162:1:B>
Lot of problems <,> in the list of problems

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#163:1:C>
You get joy <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#164:1:B>
But I don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#165:1:A>
But I think sir <,> it all depends on how your wife is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#166:1:A>
Suppose <,> you get a okay understanding wife is okay

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#167:1:A>
But suppose you get a different kind of wife a nagging wife from
the some one who just can't adjust with you

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#168:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#169:1:A>
Then marriage is not the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#170:1:B>
Then even you will be segregated from the society you
relatives as well as uh friends <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#171:1:C>
Always you must be <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#172:1:A>
You might be lucky sir

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#173:1:C>
You must be optimistic

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#174:1:A>
Oh yes yes yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#175:1:C>
You should not think that you will get a nagging and <,> uh
obsessive <,,> uh such kind of wife you get you should not think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#176:1:B>
Next thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#177:1:B>
People say that must you get me educated ladies atleast a graduate
or post graduate what is there in it <,> all are woman <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#178:1:A>
No <,> graduation post graduation or <,> <w> it's </w> all
goes to help <,> someone who can understand us who can <,> vibe with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#179:1:A>
For example okay <,> we have done our MA and all that <,> suppose
we do get married with someone who is not having any education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#180:1:A>
There is a total difference between us

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#181:1:A>
So you may not exactly <,,> have a better a good understanding

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#182:1:B>
My my father is an MA <,,> my mother did not <,> see she
couldn't write at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-024#183:1:B>
They adjusted <,> they had a very good life

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#184:1:C>
That is the matter <w> that's </w> what <,> even my wife <,,>
uh she is not a <{> <[> graduate </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#185:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{> you what what your

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-024#186:1:C>
