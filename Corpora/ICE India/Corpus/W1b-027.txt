Sir, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-027#7:1>
With reference to the above mentioned subject, we
wish to divert  
your attention towards the supply position of ENCOLOGY. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#8:1>
We have paid subscription towards <quote> ` ENCOLOGY'
</quote> for the  
period of Jan-Dec, 1991, against your bill no. 379 dated 7-
11- 90 through  
D.D. No. 954592 dated 11- 12- 90. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#9:1>
It is, therefore, obvious that there need not be any
gaps in the  
supply. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#10:1>
However, we have not received a single issue of said
journal till  
this date. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#11:1>
In this context, couple of reminders were sent <del>

However, we are sorry to state in this matter,
that you have  
neither supplied the issues nor even replied so far. </p>

How long we should wait for <w> 1991's </w> issues. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#17:1>
Really this fact creates an embarrassement here to
face the readers  
and faculty. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#18:1>
In fact, it is time to renew for 1992. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-027#19:1>
Therefore, we request you to look into the matter
personally and  
supply all issues of 1991 by return of post. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-027#20:1>
An early action in the matter shall be highly
