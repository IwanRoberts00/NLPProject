Good morning children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#2:1:A>
Today we are going to do the lesson <mention> The Missing Mail
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#3:1:A>
What is the name of the lesson <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#4:1:A>
<{> <[> <mention> The missing mail </mention> </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#5:1:C>
<[> The missing mail </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#6:1:A>
Can you understand anything about the title of the story <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#7:1:A>
Missing mail <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#8:1:A>
What do you understand by that <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#9:1:A>
What is missing mail ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#10:1:A>
Mail means what <,,> ? Yes <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#11:1:A>
Train <,> alright <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#12:1:A>
What is the other meaning of mail <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#13:1:A>
Yes <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#14:1:S>
<&> Inaudible </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#15:1:A>
Letter very good <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#16:1:A>
Mail you know mail <-> saying </-> they say <,> which carries the
mail <,> van and all that <,> which carries letters to the <,,> the station
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#17:1:A>
So here <quote> The missing mail </quote> means the letter <,> that
has not been delivered <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#18:1:A>
Are you able to follow this <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#19:1:A>
The letter <,> that has <,> not been delivered <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#20:1:A>
And now you tell me <,> the personalities of the post man <,> is
going to play a part <,,> isn't it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#21:1:A>
If the post man is very rude <,> he doesn't listen to you <,> he
throws your letters <,> at that time how do you feel about him <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#22:1:A>
He is a bit rude <,> impolite <,> doesn't talk to you nicely <,>
and the other one <,> who talks to you in a very nice manner

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#23:1:A>
Do you find any difference between these two persons <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#24:1:A>
Ah <,> Devyani can you tell <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#25:1:S>
Teacher we can't with a person who is not polite and uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#26:1:A>
Yes <,,> yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#27:1:A>
If the person is very courteous polite <,> then we feel like
talking to him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#28:1:A>
If he is rather very rude and arrogant <,> that time you don't feel
like talking to the <,> person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#29:1:A>
Similarly when you go to a doctor <,> a doctor who listens to your
suffering <,> your troubles and all that <,> with a patient hearing he gives
you <,> and he talks to you in a very nice manner <,> half of your troubles
are over <,> isn't it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#30:1:A>
And suppose a doctor is there <,> he talks to you in a very bad
manner <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#31:1:A>
I mean he doesn't talk to you much <,> he doesn't inquire much
about your suffering and all that <,> how do you feel <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#32:1:A>
Which doctor are you going to visit frequently <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#33:1:A>
The one <,> who is going to <,> talk to you in a very nice manner
<,> listens to you <,> and pays attention to <,> <}> <-> what is </-> <=>
what are </=> </}> your problems <,> and he tries to find a <,> solution to
that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#34:1:A>
So <,,> here in the present lesson <,> present story <,> we are
going to come across Thanappa <,> the postman of the village and let us see
<,> how he deals with the people there <,> how much he has <,> I mean <,> he
has uh <,,> he has identified himself with the people living in this village

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#35:1:A>
Each and everyone he knows by their names <,> and he identifies
himself <,> with their troubles sufferings <,> and everything <,> and gives
them advice when it is required <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#36:1:A>
Now <,> the story goes like this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#37:1:A>
All of you look into your book <,,> <&> The teacher reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#38:1:A>
Though his beat covered <,> Vinayak Mudali Street <,> and <w> it's
</w> four parallel roads <,> it took him nearly six hours <,> before he
finished his round <,> and returned to the head office in Market Road <,> to
deliver accounts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#39:1:A>
He allowed himself to get mixed up <,> with the fortunes of the
persons <,> to whom he was carrying letters <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#40:1:A>
At Number Thirteen <,> Kabir Street <,> lived the man <,> who had
come halfway up the road <,> to ask for a letter <,> for so many years now
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#41:1:A>
Thanappa <}> <-> had been </-> <,> <=> had seen </=> </}> him as a
youngster <,> and had watched him day by day <,> greying on the <indig> pyol
</indig> <,> sitting there <,> and hoping for a big prize to come <,> his way
<,> through solving crossword puzzles <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#42:1:A>
<quote> No prize yet </quote> <,> he announced to him everyday <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#43:1:A>
<quote> But <,> don't be disheartened </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#44:1:A>
<quote> Your interest has been delayed this month <,> somehow
</quote> he said to another <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#45:1:A>
<quote> Your son at Hyderabad <,> has written again <,> madam

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#46:1:A>
How many children <,,> has he now </quote> ? <&> The teacher
explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#47:1:A>
Could you follow a little bit of this <,> postman named Thanappa
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#48:1:A>
Now let us see <,,> though his beat covered Vinayak Mudali Street
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#49:1:A>
The name of the street <,> in which he had to deliver the letters
to the <,> various people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#50:1:A>
So here <,,> it took him nearly six hours <,> only one street <,>
<-> living </-> the people living there he had to deliver the letters <,> but
how many hours did it take for him ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#51:1:C>
<{> <[> Six hours </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#52:1:A>
<[> Six hours </[> </{> <,> to deliver the letters <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#53:1:A>
Can you tell me what he does in those six hours ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#54:1:A>
Why so much time he is taking <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#55:1:A>
Why does he take so much time <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#56:1:A>
Why <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#57:1:A>
What is the matter with him <,> he can just throw the letter and
come back <,> but what does he do <,,> while delivering the letters <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#58:1:A>
Dhanya <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#59:1:S>
Teacher he <O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#60:1:A>
Yes <,> he inquires about their welfare <,> he ask them about
their problems and all that <,> and he tries to find a solution to their <,>
problems <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#61:1:A>
<w> That's </w> why <,> the work which is to be finished within one
hour <,> is taking him <,> six hours to <,> complete <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#62:1:A>
So here <,,> he allowed himself <,> to get mixed up with the
fortunes of the persons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#63:1:A>
What do you understand by the phrase <,> <mention> get mixed up
with </mention> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#64:1:A>
<w> What's </w> the meaning of this phrase <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#65:1:A>
Kanchan can you tell the meaning <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#66:1:S>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#67:1:A>
No what does he do <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#68:1:A>
Means uh <,> what meaning are you getting by that <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#69:1:A>
With the fortunes <,> of the persons to whom he was carrying
letters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#70:1:A>
What do you mean by that <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#71:1:S>
He mixed up with

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#72:1:A>
<w> He's </w> very <,> what is it <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#73:1:S>
He mixed up with the villagers

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#74:1:A>
Means he has got intimate contact with them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#75:1:A>
He knows very well what are the problems <,> and <w> that's </w>
why <,> if anybody is hoping for a money order <,> or anybody <-> is </->
wants a prize <,> or anybody anybody wants a suitable match for his daughter
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#76:1:A>
Like that he knows each and <w> everyone's </w> problems <,> and he
identifies himself with all their <,> uh whatever they want with all all
their things is identifying <,> and <w> that's </w> why the writer says that
<,> he mixed up with the fortunes of the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#77:1:A>
And now the particular man whom he is talking <,> now <,> is about
living in <,> Thirteen Kabir Street <,,> and <,> this man Thanappa had been
seeing right <,,> as a <,> child <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#78:1:A>
He knew him <,> and this man today is an old man <,> who is now
having a marriageable <,> age <,> daughter <,> who is to get married <,> and
now this man is eagerly trying for a match <,> to his daughter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#79:1:A>
So here he says <,> the man was sitting on a <indig> pyol </indig>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#80:1:A>
<indig> Pyol </indig> means a carridor <,> in front of the house
<,> and this man <,> is a little bit <,> inactive you can say <,> throughout
the day he will be sitting there <,> and trying to <,> solve the crossword
puzzle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#81:1:A>
What is a crossword puzzle ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#82:1:A>
Have you seen it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#83:1:A>
Do you ever tried to solve it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#84:1:A>
You get in Sunday magazines and all that <,> magazine sections you
are having <,> everyday in <mention> The Hindustan Times </mention> and
<mention> Statesman </mention> in the last page you have it <,> isn't it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#85:1:A>
So <,> this man <,> is very busy trying to solve it <,> but up till
now <,> he was not successful <,> and he could not get a prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#86:1:A>
What does Thanappa say to him <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#87:1:A>
He says <,> no prize yet <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#88:1:A>
Mallika <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#89:1:A>
That way when he passes <,> the postman passes through that way <,>
the man eagerly looks up at him <,> why <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#90:1:A>
Because he is expecting a prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#91:1:A>
He wishes that <,> Thanappa should intimate him <,> that he had won
the crossword puzzle <,> for that week or month <,> and he is going to get a
prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#92:1:A>
But <,> Thanappa says <,> <quote> No prize yet </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#93:1:A>
<quote> You haven't won a prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#94:1:A>
But <,> don't be <,> disheartened </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#95:1:A>
Disheartened means <,> <quote> Don't be disappointed </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#96:1:A>
Yes <,> <&> student name </&>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#97:1:S>
Disappointed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#98:1:A>
Yes <,> very good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#99:1:A>
Disheartened means <,> <quote> Don't lose heart <,> don't lose
courage <,> have the will power <,> try <,> try like that <,> and one day you
are going to be <,> successful </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#100:1:A>
<quote> Your interest has been delayed this month somehow </quote>
he said to another <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#101:1:A>
Now another first he has gone to another house to deliver a letter
<,> and there the man is expecting some interest <,> and he <,> consoles him
that <,> his interest has been delayed a little bit <,> but it is going to be
added to the <,> and <,> soon he is going to receive it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#102:1:A>
And then to the third one he says <,> <quote> Your son at
Hyderabad <,> has written again madam <,> how many children has he now
</quote> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#103:1:A>
He says to another lady <,> <quote> Your son has written a letter
from Hyderabad <,> and now <,> he enquires about your <,> welfare </quote>
<,,> <&> The teacher reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#104:1:A>
<quote> I did not know that <,> you had applied for this <,>
Madras job <,> you haven't cared to tell me!

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#105:1:A>
It doesn't matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#106:1:A>
When I bring you your appointment order <,> you must <}> <-> feed
</-> <=> feed </=> </}> me with coconut <indig> payasam </indig> </quote>
<,,> <&> The teacher explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#107:1:A>
And now here is another person <,> who had applied for an
interview <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#108:1:A>
He informed him <,> that he had got selected <,> and he has got
the appointment order to him <,> and he says you have to give me feast <,>
because <w> I've </w> <,> brought <,> good news <,> for you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#109:1:A>
So like that <,> each and every person <,> very intimately he
knows what are their problems <,> and he finds the solutions <,> and through
the letters which he is delivering <,> he expects that <,> they are getting
someting good <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#110:1:A>
Something good is going to <,> happen to <,> them <&> The teacher
reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#111:1:A>
And <,> at each of their places <,> he stops for nearly half an
hour <,> especially <,> if anyone received money order <,> he just settle
down <,> quite nicely <,> with his bags and bundles spread about him <,> and
would not rise <,> till he gathered an idea <,> of how and where <,> every
<indig> rupee </indig> was going <,,> <&> The teacher explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#112:1:A>
You see the concern of this postman <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#113:1:A>
He talks to the person <,> if a person gets a money order <,> he
does not quickly <,> deliver the money <,> and get it signed <,> the form <,>
and leave the place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#114:1:A>
He would sit down <,> along with his bag and baggage <,> he will
talk to the person <,> enquires him about the expenditure <,> which is going
to do with that money <,> and he fears that <,> ensures that <,> each <indig>
rupee </indig> is going to be spent <,> in a fruitful way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#115:1:A>
It is not being <,> wasted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#116:1:A>
Are you able to follow this point all of you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#117:1:A>
How intimately how much personal interest he is taking <,> in the
affairs of each and everyone <,> and how much he is concerned about <,> the
expenditure of that person <,> the way how he is going to spend the money <,>
which he had delivered just now through money order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#118:1:A>
Whether it is being done the expenditure in a fruitful manner <,>
or it is going to be a waste <,> that he finds out <,> from that person <,>
and gets satisfaction only <,> when he sees that it is spent in the <,> right
manner <,,> <&> The teacher reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#119:1:A>
If it was a hot day <,> he sometimes asked <,> for a tumbler of
buttermilk <,> <&> The teacher explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#120:1:A>
When it is very hot <,> that time <,> he would ask for a <,> glass
of buttermilk <&> The teacher reads </&> and sat down to enjoy it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#121:1:A>
Everybody liked him <,> on his beat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#122:1:A>
He was a part and parcel of their existence <,> their hopes <,>
aspirations <,> and activities <,> <&> The teacher explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#123:1:A>
So the people living <,> in that particular village <,> this
postman <,> Thanappa is just like a <,> member of their family <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#124:1:A>
Are you able to understand <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#125:1:A>
Why <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#126:1:A>
Because <,> unlike the other postman of today <,> nowadays what do
you find <,> a very rude <,> they don't bother about <,> what <,> you have
received <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#127:1:A>
Whether it is a bad news or good news <,> nobody bothers about it
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#128:1:A>
But here <,> he would go <,> and sit with them <,> talk with them
<,> listen to their problems <,> and assured them <,> and give them advice
<,> regarding <,> what is to be <,> done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#129:1:A>
So what type of a postman is Thanappa <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#130:1:A>
A very caring <,> affectionate <,> kind <,> polite <,> type of man
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#131:1:A>
Shall I continue sir <,,> ? <&> Addressed to someone who is
recording the <w> teacher's </w> lesson </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#132:1:A>
Now look here <&> The teacher reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#133:1:A>
Of all his contacts <,> the one with which he was most intimately
bound up <,> was Number Ten <,> Vinayak Mudali Street <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#134:1:A>
Ramanujam was a senior clerk <,> in the Revenue Division Office
<,> and Thanappa had carried letters to that address <,> for over a
generation now <,> <&> The teacher explains </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#135:1:A>
And now the <,> <}> <-> <.> pa </.> </-> <=> particular </=> </}>
person <,,> who is going to be the hero of our story <,> is <,> Mr Ramanujam
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#136:1:A>
Where is he working <,> ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#137:1:C>
He is working as clerk

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#138:1:A>
He is working <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#139:1:A>
Kanchan <,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#140:1:S>
He is working as senior clerk

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-018#141:1:A>
Yes <,> he is a senior clerk in the <,> Revenue Office <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#142:1:A>
Sit down please <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#143:1:A>
And now <,> <&> The teacher reads </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#144:1:A>
His earliest association <,> with Ramanujam <,> was years and
years ago <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#145:1:A>
<w> Ramanujam's </w> wife was away in the village <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#146:1:A>
A card arrived for Ramanujam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#147:1:A>
Thanappa <,> as was his custom <,> glanced to it <,> at the
sorting table itself <,> and the moment he was ready to start out <,> went
straight <,> to Vinayak Mudali Street <,> though in the ordinary course <,>
over hundred and fifty addresses preceded it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#148:1:A>
He went straight to <w> Ramanujam's </w> house <,> knocked on the
door <,> and shouted <,> <quote> postman sir <,> postman </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#149:1:A>
When Ramanujam opened it <,> he said <,> <quote> Give me a handful
of sugar <,> before I give you this card <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#150:1:A>
Happy father <,> !

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#151:1:A>
After all these years of prayers <,> !

<ICE-IND:S1B-018#152:1:A>
Don't complain that <,> it is a daughter <,>
