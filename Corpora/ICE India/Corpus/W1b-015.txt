Dear Professor Shastri, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#6:1>
Thanks for your Sept 27 letter and the enclosure. 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#7:1>
On 26th Sept ' 97 our project completed its 2-years and unless the  
release and head-wise allocation comes for the third year, it will be  
difficult to meet your travel expenses. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#8:1>
But I am sure KNM will find money for himself to travel to Poona. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#9:1>
I am happy to know that the Department of English Poona University  
is taking interest in the ICE activities. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#10:1>

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#19:1>
Thanks for calling me and for the copy of your letter to Dr.  
Narayana Murthy. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#20:1>
I haven't had a chance of meeting him and discussing the project  
that you have mentioned in your letter.

I am sure, if applied for jointly ( by you and him), the project

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#22:1>
Let me know if there is anything I can do for this joint effort.

Dear Prof. Sastry, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#33:1>
You must be wondering as to why this letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#34:1>
But I wanted to inform you in advance before a bulky packet  
containing your IL-49 offprints ( sent by me personally by regd post) reaches  
you that your offprints are not lost. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#35:1>
I got them today from Prof. Indira Junghare who first got this packet  
from the LSI office at Pune. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#36:1>
She thought I was responsible for all mailing, and she repacked them  
and sent them back. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#37:1>
Subsequently I got a letter from her explaining what she had done. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#38:1>
By then I had opened the packet. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#39:1>
I could have sent them to Dr. Patyal at Pune but I thought I would  
send them to you & inform him. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#40:1>
Now, if you did get Prof. <w> Junghare's </w> offprints, pl. send  
them to Pune. </p>

My dearest Mr. Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#86:2>
I regret the inexcusable delay in writing to you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#87:2>
However I hope it is not too late to modify your planned visit to  
Europe <del> to </del> in such a way as to make a stopover at Muscat. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#88:2>
Our plans are just finalised. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#89:2>
We will be in Muscat till the 15<sp>th</sp> of May. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#90:2>
Thereafter all of us will be going to India on a holiday. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#91:2>
I am likely to be in India for about 3 weeks only. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#92:2>
But Pushpa will <del> likely </del> probably be there for about twice  
that time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#93:2>
If you could somehow fit Muscat into your itinerary it would  
please us no end. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#94:2>
I will be able to obtain a visa for you within a week of the receipt  
of your photographs ( 2) and copies of your passport. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#95:2>
Kindly let us know. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#96:2>
Arun has come to Muscat for his revision holidays and will be back  
for his exams on 23<sp>rd</sp> March. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#97:2>
He will be back in Muscat after his exams on 9<sp>th</sp> April. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#98:2>
So from 9<sp>th</sp> April all the four of us will be here till the  
middle of May. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#99:2>
There could be no better time for you to pass through this place,  
except for the weather which is rather hot at that time - - but I assure you  
it would not bother you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#100:2>
I am sure you could persuade Mrs. Shastri to accompany you too. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#101:2>
Now that you are without any encubrances it would be <}> <-> The  
</-> <+> the </+> </}> best time to go out together on a long tour - - on a  
second honeymoon, as it were! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#102:2>
In <del> which </del> that case you must arrange to stay with us for  
a longer time before you proceed to Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#103:2>
Dubai is also worth visiting if you have not done so thus far. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#104:2>
Please convey our warmest regards to Mrs. Shastri, and our love  
to Meera, Geetha Raju and Girish. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#105:2>
By the way, how about giving our address and phone No. ( 709928) to  
Raju just in case his ship calls at Muscat some time. </p>

He once casually mentioned that Principal Sathe and Prof. Mathure

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#116:2>
Mrs. Bhagwat, Mrs. Pandit and Mr. Bhandare retired earlier. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#117:2>
How the time has flown! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#118:2>
And we are certainly not getting younger. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#119:2>
We have longed to see you & Mrs. Shastri and the children but have  
somehow failed to make it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#120:2>
We are keen on seeing you at least this time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#121:2>
Hence I would like to know where you will be between June  
1<sp>st</sp> and June 22. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#122:2>
We have planned to go on a holiday during this period. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#123:2>
If you are at Kholapur at that time we would like to be with all of  
you at least for a few hours. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#124:2>
I fear that we will lose touch with you if we don't see you soon. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#125:2>
Could you please write to me either at the Muscat address or at the  
Bombay address given below when and where we could visit you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#126:2>
It would be good to have a telephone number at which we could  
contact you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#127:2>
We have a short holiday and a lot of things to do and so wouldn't  
want to take a chance and visit Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#128:2>
We want to be sure to meet all of you when we come over. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#129:2>
So I hope you will drop me a couple of lines to reach me in Muscat  
before the end of this month - - or at the Bombay address so I can be sure to  
get the letter. </p>

Dear Dr Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#138:3>
Thank you for your letter dated 20 - 1 - 90. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#139:3>
The delay in replying has been because I was uncertain as to whether  
I could attend the ELTC seminar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#140:3>
I know now, and I must express my great regret at not being able to  
attend this seminar, because of ( a) the <w> children's </w> time table - -  
they have exams; & ( b) various programmes being held in our own department  
including a seminar on <mention> Directions in English Studies </mention> ,  
plus workshops by the ELTC. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#141:3>
I would have loved to visit Kolhapur & perhaps see Vanashree in  
Bombay <foreign> en route </foreign> , but <w> it's </w> far too much for me  
to organise at the moment. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#142:3>
I do hope the seminar is a success; but <w> I'm </w> getting  
rather despondent about the ELTCs - - or at least the ELTC we have here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#143:3>
We organised some teacher training programmes - - but teachers are  
not very forthcoming. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#144:3>
In fact, they simply don't want to work & <w> it's </w> more like  
dragging unwilling horses to the water. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#145:3>
As regards the CDC syllabus, they don't like the communication  
skills, they don't like the <mention> Honours </mention> syllabus & they  
can't bear the thought of having a compulsory <quote> ` Structure of Modern  
English' </quote> at the MA level. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#146:3>
So much for change. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#147:3>
They say books are not available for teaching Bible, Greek myths  
etc., at the Hons level, yet the fact is that they don't want to make efforts  
to find books from libraries & prepare afresh. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#148:3>
<w> I'm </w> getting more and more cynical as I get to meet more &  
more teachers ( at least in this part of the country) & feel that no teacher  
training <}> <-> prog. </-> <+> programme </+> </}> can be successful unless  
it grows from the interest & motivation of the teachers themselves. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#149:3>
ASC is a farce - its another expensive exercise to appease sections  
of the academic <del> r </del> mafia. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#150:3>
I will be writing to Dr. Sethi as well, since he has visited our  
centre & is in touch with events here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#151:3>
Perhaps you could discuss these aspects in the seminar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#152:3>
<w> I'd </w> be grateful if you send me a report of the <}> <->  
proceding </-> <+> proceedings </+> </}> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#153:3>
I hate to sound so fed up, particularly because you are doing so  
much at your own level & at your centre; so I would like to hear from you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#154:3>
Perhaps something promising will emerge from the seminar. </p>

Dear Dr Shastri, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#164:4>
Thank you for your letter dated Feb. 16<sp>th</sp>. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#165:4>
I hope you have received my earlier letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#166:4>
I would have liked to take up your kind invitation to act as  
resource person for the ELTC seminar, but for reasons already mentioned, I  
won't be able to make it this time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#167:4>
As you know, I take a keen interest in the ELTCs & how they are  
struggling to survive but I wonder whether it is not after all, a losing  
battle. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#168:4>
I would like to put the following points to you for consideration at  
the seminar if possible : 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#169:4>
<h> <ul> 1) Interaction between ELTCs & discipline-based ASCs </ul>  
: </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#170:4>
At a recent visit to Alwar, I met some people from Jaipur ( which  
has the English ASC for the whole of the northern region) & they were very  
pessimistic & depressed about the situation in Jaipur where the ELTC has not  
taken off at all. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#171:4>
I feel that way too, because Jaipur ASC has so far not initiated any  
kind of contact with our ELTC on proposed any joint / related programmes of  
teacher training etc. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#172:4>
They have held one or two courses on literature, again with no  
co-ordination or consultation or contact with us. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#173:4>
What can be done in such circumstances? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#174:4>
<h> <ul> 2) Teacher training </ul> : </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#175:4>
Teachers are resistant to the idea. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#176:4>
UGC gives funds to college principals & administrators to run  
orientation programmes, but the latter have no idea how to do so. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#177:4>
Can I suggest that ELTCs ( jointly with CIEFL perhaps) produce a  
little booklet on <quote> ` How to organise training programmes' </quote> for  
circulation to college heads of dept. & principals so that they have specific  
guidelines on how to make best use of the funds they get? </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-015#178:4>
Please let me know how the discussion goes. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#179:4>
I would be happy to receive a report of the proceedings of the  
seminar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#180:4>
Once again, I express my regrets for not being able to attend. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-015#181:4>
