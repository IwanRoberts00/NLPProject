<ICE-IND:S2B-029#1:1:A>
In the last programme <,,> we had seen <,,> four basic consumer  
rights <,,> right to safety <,,> right to information <,,> right to choose  
<,,> and right to redressal <,,> their concepts and connotations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#2:1:A>
In this programme <,,> we propose to concentrate <,,> on <w>  
consumers' </w> right to safety <,,> which is the most paramount <,> of all  
consumer rights <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#3:1:A>
Now <,> when we think of consumer <,,> safety <,> where wide range  
of goods and services <,,> to which <,> the consumers are exposed <,,> in  
relation to health hazard <,> or even for that matter <,> life and death <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#4:1:A>
Take a small item <,,> like detergents <,> and drinking water <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#5:1:A>
If the drinking water is not wholesome and potable <,,> and free  
from germs and bacteria <,,> there are cases where <,> the people <,,> run  
into <,> cholera or gastroentitis <,,> and succumb to death <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#6:1:A>
We had the situation last year in Ahmedabad <,,> where three hundred  
and fifty people died <,> on that account <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#7:1:A>
Take uh <,> detergent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#8:1:A>
We do not realise but <,,> <w> it's </w> the poor or unsafe quality  
of detergent <,,> adversely affect <,> the human skin <,,> and it also  
affects <,> the life of the garment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#9:1:A>
Now <,,> take the larger cases <,,> of uh <,> aircrash <,> where all  
the passengers flying by the plane <,> might die <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#10:1:A>
Or take the <,> still worse <,,> running out of the hazardous  
chemical industry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#11:1:A>
The <,> most known example could be <,> of the Bhopal gas tragedy  
<,> where three thousand five hundred people <,> are <}> <-> report to </->  
<+> reported </+> </}> <,> to have been dead <,> because of <,> the leak of M  
I S <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#12:1:A>
Now therefore in this context <,,> it becomes very relevant <,,> as  
to how the consumers <,,> can <,> and should protect <,> both their health  
<,> as well as life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#13:1:A>
Now <,,> here <,> when we begin with the story <,,> we should look  
at some of the other items of domestic or day to day use <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#14:1:A>
Take for example domestic gas cylinder <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#15:1:A>
There are cases where <,> the gas cylinders are exploded <,> and  
resulting into <,> death of the house wives <,> and sometimes with even <,>  
the babes in their arms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#16:1:A>
Take other areas <,,> <mention> Domestic electrical appliances  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#17:1:A>
These are of day to day use <,> and there are cases of  
electrocution <,,> that because of some defect somewhere <,> person gets a  
shock <,> and he gets killed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#18:1:A>
Now <,> take the other situations <,> where <,,> uh the hazardous  
chemicals are involved <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#19:1:A>
When <,,> because of fire <,,> explosion <,> leakage or spillage  
<,> the people in the neighbourhood <,> so far the factories are concerned  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#20:1:A>
Or people travelling on the highway <,> when transportation of  
hazardous chemicals is involved <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#21:1:A>
Or people living in far away distances <,> where the hazardous  
chemicals are stored <,> for marketing or distribution <,> and something goes  
wrong <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#22:1:A>
Or take another area <,> housing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#23:1:A>
If the housing is not properly designed <,> and the construction or  
<,> workmanship <,> are not of proper order <,> then they result into <,>  
unsafe housing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#24:1:A>
Apart from the most obvious one <,,> like the collapse of the house  
<,> there are more subtle <,> forms of safety <,,> like <,> from the <,,> <}>  
<-> <.> fl </.> </-> <=> from </=> </}> the <,> uhm floors above you <,> if  
the <,> water <,> or the fluid <,> from the sanitary blocks <,> latrines or  
urinals begin to <,> uh drip <,> or begins to <,> uh percolate <,> then that  
leads to a different kind of health hazard <,> arising out of dampness <,>  
and arising out of <,> the discharge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#25:1:A>
Now <,> more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be  
<,> one where <,> because of either the poor workmanship or a bad design <,>  
where a part or whole of the house collapses <,> and as a result of which  
large number of people <,> can die and do die <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#26:1:A>
And this kind of things we have to see even <,> more often in case  
of public buildings <,> or public works like bridges <,> dams and things of  
that kind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#27:1:A>
So therefore the question that arises is <,> that if this is the  
<,> manner in which <,> the consumers are exposed <,> so far as their health  
<,> and safety are concerned <,> how does one go about it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#28:1:A>
Now one can talk of some measures that the consumers can take <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#29:1:A>
For example <,> if you are using a hair dye <,,> you should ensure  
to see that <,,> the chemicals used therein <,> are not likely to cause  
cancer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#30:1:A>
Or if you take the examples of domestic electrical appliances <,>  
whether do they carry <,> I S I mark <,> given by <,> bureau of Indian  
standards in the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#31:1:A>
Or <,> if you look at the detergents <,> whether they happen to be  
of a good quality <,> and as a result of which <,> neither the skin <,> nor  
the life of the garments are likely to be affected <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#32:1:A>
So <,> there are some areas where <,> the consumers themselves can  
take care <,> in both ways <,> either in terms of the <,> following the  
instructions <,> that are given <,> for the use of these products <,> or <,>  
even before buying the products <,> one can take certain measures to see that  
<,> they do not run into <,> unsafe goods <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#33:1:A>
There is another area of consumer safety <,> namely the  
adulteration of food <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#34:1:A>
And there are cases reported time and again in the news papers <,>  
where because of the food poisoning people tend to die <,> or run into far  
more serious <,> physical ailments <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#35:1:A>
There are also very subtle kinds of cases <,> where <,> there are  
some articles or some components in the food <,,> to which certain people  
might be alergic <,> and as a result of which <,> they tend to suffer a great  
deal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#36:1:A>
Take another area <,> for example <,> medicine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#37:1:A>
Now ordinarily all of us understand <,,> that medicine is supposed  
to help us <,> in terms of the treatment from which we might suffer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#38:1:A>
But there are <,> two kinds of serious problems with medicine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#39:1:A>
Take those medicines <,,> which are available across the counter  
<,> without <w> doctor's </w> prescription <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#40:1:A>
So in a sense <,> the patient <,> becomes a doctor <,,> and <,>  
when these medicines are purchased across the counter <,> the concern is <,,>  
how much information <,> the patient has <,,> and is he able to take care <,>  
when he uses those medicines as such <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#41:1:A>
You must have seen the reports of <,> couple of years back <,> when  
because of the adulterated <,> or toxic substances in the glucose saline <,>  
about fourteen children died <,> in Bombay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#42:1:A>
Now <,> some of the medicines <,> across the counter which look  
very innocent <,,> they themselves can become <,> hazardous <,> in respect of  
certain categories of patients like <,> children <,> pregnant women <,> or  
aged people suffering from <,> blood pressure or heart trouble <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#43:1:A>
So therefore <,,> uh even the medicine <,> which normally supposed  
to help us <,> can cause this kind of health hazards <,> or the problems of  
safety <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#44:1:A>
Now let us take <,> some areas where <,> you are not able to  
immediately connect <,,> the use of the product or the existance of the  
product with the safety <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#45:1:A>
Take for example asbestos <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#46:1:A>
Now the people who have been working in the asbestos factory <,>  
there has been situations where <,> after five years of the retirement or ten  
years of the retirement <,> the disease of asbestos comes on the surface <,>  
and by that time they might have not only left the factory but they might  
have left even the city where they were working <,> and might have gone to  
their respective villages <,> and they are not able to connect <,> that this  
particular <,> health hazard <,> has a reason because of their exposure <,>  
to <,> the factory where they worked <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#47:1:A>
Not only that <,> even the people who happen to come in contact  
with the workers <,> they carry those fibres from them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#48:1:A>
Even <,> take the consumers for examples <,> where the asbestos <,>  
material is used <,> either for insulation <,> partition <,> uh or <,>  
roofing <,> or piping and all that <,> and in the course of time they  
disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#49:1:A>
And this is such a slow process <,> that it may take place after  
six months after five years or fifteen years <,> and one is not able to  
realise <,> the cause - effect relationship as such <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#50:1:A>
Take another example <,> namely <,> the disposal of toxic waste or  
disposal of uh <,> chemical effluents <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#51:1:A>
They might <,> take place in one city <,> and the effect <,> on the  
<,> underground water <,> in the wells <,> or in the springs <,> might be  
found thirty forty miles away <,> from the place where they were discharged  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#52:1:A>
Or <,> the toxic waste might have been dumped today <,> and may be  
after fifteen years <,> some disintegration takes place <,> and the ground  
water gets affected <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#53:1:A>
So therefore <,,> you can see now from the various examples and <,>  
kinds of situations that I have described <,> that the area of consumer  
safety is so wide and so large <,> that one has to be extremely careful or  
cautious <,> in ones own life <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#54:1:A>
Now <,> there obviously will be a question <,> that all this is  
fine <,> but what can be done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#55:1:A>
Now there are number of things that can be done and one can only  
illustrate <,> as to how far you can succeed in getting things done <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#56:1:A>
Say for example <,,> take domestic electrical appliances and some  
of the items that we use <,> in our homes day to day <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#57:1:A>
Because of the public opinion pressure <,> ultimately <,> the  
government of India came forward <,> and they not only made <,> the I S I  
standards <,> compulsory <,> uh I S I standards mandatory <,> for these  
domestic electrical appliances <,> but now in respect of some items for the  
country as a whole <,> even the certification <,> by I S I <,> now called B I  
S <,> has been made compulsory <,> and those items happen to be <,> like <,>  
these electric irons <,> emersion heaters <,> radiators uh <,> then take <->  
a </-> <,> the switches <,> two pin and three pin plugs <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#58:1:A>
Now those about eight items <,> for which <}> <-> <.> no </.> </->  
<=> not </=> </}> only the B I S standards are mandatory <,> but even  
certification <,> has been made compulsory <,> which means that <,> unless  
these items carry I S I certification mark <,> they cannot be sold in the  
country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#59:1:A>
Now at least one thing <,> that I S I certification assures you is  
<,> that <,> if the certification is done rightly <,> at least they are safe  
products <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#60:1:A>
They may or may not be of extraordinarily high quality <,> but  
certainly they give you an assurance <,> that they are the safe products <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#61:1:A>
If by chance <,> some manufacturer <,> though he is carrying an I S  
I mark <,> but those products don't confirm to I S I standard <,> then his  
liability becomes much bigger <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#62:1:A>
And in any case <,> Bureau of Indian Standards <,> helps you in  
respect of dealing with that kind of situation <,> either in terms of  
replacement of goods or any other remedy that may become available <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#63:1:A>
Uh in case of Gujarat <,> the state has gone even a step further  
<,> that all those faulty electrical appliances <,> for which <,> I S I  
standards were made mandatory <,> way back in nineteen seventy-six and  
further amended in nineteen eighty-one <,> all those appliances now <,> are  
required to carry an I S I certification mark <,> before they are being sold  
or marketed <,> marketed in Gujarat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#64:1:A>
Uh <,> one option is given <,> that either they carry I S I  
certification mark <,> or they carry a certification mark <,> provided by  
chief electrical engineer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#65:1:A>
So this is one measure <,> where the consumers can feel reassured  
that if they use the I S I certificated marks <,> electrical goods in the  
home <,> or appliances in the home <,> they may <,> be reasonably safe <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#66:1:A>
Another example that I want to you give is very interesting one <,>  
uh but is a foreign one <,,> where again it deals with the drugs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#67:1:A>
This happened <,> in United States and particularly in the state of  
California <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#68:1:A>
Uh somewhere around nineteen seventy-one <,> or meaning around that  
decade <,> a drug was introduced in the market <,> uh in the short words it  
was called des D E S <,> and its full name is <,> Dyfile <,> Solbitrol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#69:1:A>
Now this particular brand of medicine <,> was introduced in the  
market <,> to help pregnant women <,> to avoid miscarriage or abortion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#70:1:A>
The drug was found to be effective <,> so far as prevention of  
miscarriage <,> or abortion was concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#71:1:A>
But <,> it had an unusual kind of <-> an </-> fact <,,> not on the  
pregnant women who took the medicine <,> but of the daughters <,,> born of  
those pregnancies <,,> and that too after the daughters <,> reached the age  
of puberty <,> between fourteen and eighteen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#72:1:A>
And those daughters were found to suffer from cancer <,,> and an  
interesting question of law arose <,> that whether these daughters <,> born  
of these pregnancies <,> have a remedy against <,> the pharmaceutical  
companies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#73:1:A>
You can imagine the difficulty involved <,,> that the daughters who  
are the victims <,,> <}> <-> are not </-> <=> are not </=> </}> the consumers  
of the medicine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#74:1:A>
And their mothers had consumed this medicine <,> before fifteen  
twenty years <,> when they were <,> in their mothers wombs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#75:1:A>
And the matter went to the <}> <-> <.> Califor </.> </-> <=>  
California </=> </}> <,> state supreme court <,> and the court found a  
solution to this problem <,,> since this medicine <,> des <,> was  
manufactured and marketed <,,> by a large number of pharamceutical companies  
<,> so what the court did was <,> that court asserting <,,> the total sale of  
the medicine <,> and in this way total <,> market for this medicine <,> how  
much was the share <,> or the market share <,> of each of this particular  
products by each of the pharmaceutical companies <,> and depending upon the  
market share <,> of the pharmaceutical company for this particular drug <,>  
during seventies <,> the court awarded <,> a total damage <,> let us say may  
be <,> a million dollars or half a million dollars <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#76:1:A>
And and then <,> the court said <,> on the principles of  
apportionment <,> linked with the market share <,> as to how much money shall  
be paid <,> by each of the pharmaceutical company <,> to these daughters who  
had suffered from cancer because of <,> the adverse effect of this medicine  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#77:1:A>
As for a statistical information I can tell you <,> that there are  
about one thousand such suits <,> filed in <,> the U S courts <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#78:1:A>
Now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the  
market <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#79:1:A>
So what one would like to look at <,> or look back and see <,> that  
there are preventive measures <,,> which can be taken by the consumers and or  
the authorities concerned <,> at the same time <,> in the <,> unfortunate  
event <,> of loss or injury sustained by the consumers <,> there are remedies  
available <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#80:1:A>
And <,> American example goes to a large extreme <,> or a large  
unusual kind of condition <,> where <,> one is not able to prove <,> the  
cause effect relationship <,> between the particular product <,> and its  
consequence and yet <,> the victims were able to recover <,> substantial  
amount of damages from the pharmaceutical companies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#81:1:A>
Let us now come to the Indian scene <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#82:1:A>
If on account of <,> use or consumption <,,> of any unsafe goods or  
<,> unsafe services <,> of which I gave a number of illustrations or examples  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#83:1:A>
If the consumer <,,> suffers loss or injury <,,> what remedies are  
available to him <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#84:1:A>
Under the Consumer Protection Act <,,> of nineteen eighty-six <,,>  
three tier <,> quasi judicial machinery is being set up <,,> consumer  
grievence <,,> disputes <,> redressal district forum <,> state commission and  
national commission <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#85:1:A>
Now if the consumer is able to prove <,,> that <,> the loss or  
injury <,> suffered by him on account of unsafe goods or unsafe services <,>  
was on account of <,> the negligence <,,> of the people who provided the  
goods or services <,> the consumer will be able to claim <,> damages <,> in  
respect of loss or injuries suffered by him <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-029#86:1:A>
So therefore <,> this new machinery <,> not only provide the remedy  
<,> but that remedy is likely to be <,> most inexpensive <,> and least time  
consumings <,> because they are starting on a clean slate <,> and they are  
specialised tribunals <,,> </I>
