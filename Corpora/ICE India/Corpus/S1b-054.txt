<ICE-IND:S1B-054#1:1> ( 1) Inderjeet Kumar </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-054#2:1:A>
Uh our finance minister whom I respect a great deal <,> <&>
noise </&> but one thing on which <,> he has not been able to persuade me to
agree with him <,,> that <,> we are not ready getting into <?> debt </?> <,,>
or we have not even now what to <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#3:1:A>
Now it would as it is <,> if you look at the budget <,> <{1> <[1>
already <,> you see a very interesting figure <,> <&> noises </&> uh <O> a
few words </O> and uh budget came <,> have even graphically <,> <{2> <[2> <O>
a few words </O> <,> the break up of the <indig> rupee </indig> <,> as to how
a <indig> rupee </indig> come <,> and how a <indig> rupee </indig> goes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#4:1:A>
And when the break up you see you find <,,> that twenty-seven
<indig> paisa </indig> in a <indig> rupee </indig> <,,> go towards the debt
service charges <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#5:1:A>
Now these twenty-seven should be very telling <,,> when you realise
<,> that our defence budget <,> which is of course <,> more than anything
else <,,> is thirteen <,> <indig> paisa </indig> in a <indig> rupee </indig>
<,> that is your debt service charges are already <,> more than twice <,> of
your defence expenditure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#6:1:A>
Now <,,> I must compliment the finance minister because <,> his
persuasion in <,> Washington always gets him more loans <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#7:1:A>
And since for everytime he comes back <,,> he comes back with a bag
full <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#8:1:A>
And then bagfull ultimately has to be paid <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#9:1:A>
We have created an impression in the country <,,> that it is a day
of jubilation <,,> when we get more debts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#10:1:A>
As it is <O> one word </O> even in families when we start
celebrations as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#11:1:A>
When more debts are required <,> various things just out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#12:1:A>
When <,> the truth comes home <,> and things become very difficult
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#13:1:A>
The learned finance minister would have seen <,> the latest report
of the U N D T <,> which I had a <,> had a <,,> time to glance over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#14:1:A>
Now the whole system of international monitory system is so
manipulated <,,> that the more we <,,> give the more we want <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#15:1:A>
You won't do it <,> and if you look at the logic of debt trap of
any society <,> that is what is happening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#16:1:A>
Because devaluation is manipulated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#17:1:A>
Ever since we have launched on this <,> tryst with <,>
globalisation <,,> the Indian <indig> rupee </indig> has been <,> constantly
devalued <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#18:1:A>
About <,> some times formally <,,> many times <,> and more times
informally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#19:1:A>
And today I think if I have mentioned somewhere in my article
recently <,> which is gone down by forty-two percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#20:1:A>
Uh I hope <w> I'm </w> <,> saying the right figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#21:1:A>
The end result is <,> that you find <,> that you go on pay <,>
there is not a single country as much <O> a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#22:1:A>
And this is the irony of the whole thing <,,> that the more you pay
the more you owe <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#23:1:A>
And this will go on happening in our case also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#24:1:A>
We will be happy for a while <,> but I don't think we can be happy
<,> for a long time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#25:1:A>
Everytime uh <,> the new <O> one word </O> policy if I may <,>
quote myself <,> in the article that I have just written <,> <quote> the use
of this policy has been uh <,> reversing many sound economic policies <,>
that we have followed in the past </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#26:1:A>
What was our past <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#27:1:A>
Our past was primarily based on self-reliance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#28:1:A>
Our past was on import substitution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#29:1:A>
And for number of years <,> following the Nehruvian <,,> outlook
<,> this society has built itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#30:1:A>
It is not as if we are a new country <,> like any African African
country in dark continents <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#31:1:A>
We are a country who have built in last <,> uh uhm so many years
after freedon <,> to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as
industrialisation goes <,> so far as our economy goes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#32:1:A>
We are in a mess because of the debt that we took <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#33:1:A>
Who took the debts <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#34:1:A>
How debts were taken <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#35:1:A>
How debts were squander ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#36:1:A>
I will not enter into that <,> area because I know <,> who did it
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#37:1:A>
And I know on what we spent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#38:1:A>
But the main difficutly is different now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#39:1:A>
Let me see we make this country believe <,> as if self-reliance and
<,> and <,> import substitution were dirty words

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#40:1:A>
And we must get out of that <,> and launch launch on the new era
<,> then we go on doing this <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#41:1:A>
So therefore you see that increasingly now <,> we are getting into
<,> more and more debts <,> and even the experts have said by the end of the
eighth plan <,,> if we continue doing what we are doing <,> our our debt
service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent <,,> of the revenue
earnings <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#42:1:A>
Well it is for <,> the learned minister to decide <,> whether that
will be a good day for India <,> or that will be a day for celebration for
India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#43:1:A>
That is for him to decide

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#44:1:A>
I don't know <,> I hope I will not live enough <,> long enough to
see that day <,> I don't want to see that day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#45:1:A>
Because <,> I come from that generation which participated in
freedom struggle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#46:1:A>
I also belong <}> <-> that <-> <+> to </+> </}> that generation <,>
which took pride <,> in the policies that Nehru followed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#47:1:A>
And we still continue to take pride in that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#48:1:A>
And if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than
Nehru of course they are welcome to it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#49:1:A>
I will not question their wisdom <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#50:1:A>
But I will also say at the same time <,> that what we are doing <,>
needs caution <,> and needs understanding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#51:1:A>
The new budget that we have seen <,> is gradually shrinking <,> the
nations building prospects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#52:1:A>
The honourable finance Minister can get up and say that well <,>
this year I have given more money for education than he gave last year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#53:1:A>
That is no comparison <,,> because last year it was worst <,> so it
is slightly better than the worst <,> that is not the issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#54:1:A>
The issue basically is <,> that everything that builds the nation
ultimately <,> is shrinking <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#55:1:A>
And everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#56:1:A>
So therefore this is the policy that we are following <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#57:1:A>
I if I get timing sir I would have spoken <,> at length about other
dimensions <,> of the of the policies that India is following <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#58:1:A>
My young friend Mr <,> Minister of State for foreign affairs is
sitting here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#59:1:A>
I would have discussed the foreign policy also <,> and I would have
discussed <,> the various things that are causing us anxiety <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#60:1:A>
And I think it is not him <O> a few words </O> but one or two
points I want to make <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#61:1:A>
And one point basically is about the Kashmir today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#62:1:A>
I think this is something <,> which you must think over <,,> is
everything happening there alright <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#63:1:A>
Have we not reached a stage <,> when I think as a nation not as a
party <,> whether we sit on that side or this side <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#64:1:A>
As a nation we have to <,,> sit up and <,> uh see what we can do
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#65:1:A>
Look at the entire situation sir <,> that police was involved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#66:1:A>
The para military <,,> sector of police which have gone out there
some times cause us anxiety <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#67:1:A>
And the Prime Minister of India does not think it good enough <,>
to call even a meeting of the All Party <,,> to discuss this Kashmir
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#68:1:A>
Kashmir has been <O> one word </O> <,> from one situation to
another <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#69:1:A>
And if there is any area where we should be axious today <,,> I
think something has to be done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#70:1:A>
A few days ago I have mentioned also <,> about I O C conference
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#71:1:A>
Unfortunately yesterday I was out of town so I could not come to
the constituency committee meeting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#72:1:A>
But what I see from the reporting <,,> I I spoke to the government
of India on that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#73:1:A>
I think the policy that we are following regarding I O C <,> needs
to be to be <,> redoubled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#74:1:A>
I think I O C is a platform <,> which is converting itself <,> into
a <,> into sort of a follow on <,> organisation of what Pakistan says <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#75:1:A>
We have several countries in the <O> one word </O> Organisation who
are very friendly to us <,> most of them <,> <{3> <[3> who are they <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#76:1:A>
And I think that is uh <,> we should definitely <,> <{4> <[4> who
are they <,> Pardon <,> <{5> <[5> who are they <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#77:1:A>
Oh I beg your pardon

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#78:1:A>
I I beg you pardon

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#79:1:A>
I accept that but mean the same thing <{6> <[6> <O> a few words
</O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#80:1:A>
Uh whether you put organisation first or Islam first <,> it doesn't
make much difference <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#81:1:A>
It is so typical to us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#82:1:A>
It comes to the same thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#83:1:A>
The <,> main point that I am trying to say is that in recent time
and I hope my <,> young friend will kindly <,,> help us in that <,> and help
the country in that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#84:1:A>
That redoubling of the effort is very much called for <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#85:1:A>
And I think <,> on a <,> on a bilateral basis particularly <,> we
must make these friends feel and rewrite <,> that friendship in India <,> has
always been very profitable <,> and will continue to be profitable for each
one of them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#86:1:A>
Be the Africa be the Asia <,,> or be the Arab world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#87:1:A>
<w> India's </w> history has been <,> that in every crisis of this
region <,> India has upheld their cause <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#88:1:A>
I think <w> it's </w> not that <w> India's </w> got in danger today

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#89:1:A>
I don't see so <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#90:1:A>
But definitely they <,> their diplomacies <,> must see through the
type of propaganda <,> that we are being subjected to <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#91:1:A>
And I think that is where <,> our <}> <-> <.> wh </.> </-> <=>
whole </=> </}> effort has to be <,,> concentrated on <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-054#92:1:B>
<[1> Already </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-054#93:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#98:2:C>
( 2) Manmohan Singh </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-054#99:2:B>
Sir <,,> I am very grateful to all the honourable members <,,>
who have taken part <,,> in <,> this debate <,,> on the budget for nineteen
<,> ninety-three <,> ninety-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#100:2:B>
As I scan through <,,> the record of the debate <,,> I <,,> could
<?> defer </?> <,,> a couple of issues <,,> which <,> have educated the mind
<,> of the members <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#101:2:B>
And I thought the best use I can make <,,> of this reply to the
debate <,,> is to clarify some of those issues <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#102:2:B>
I sincerely believe <,,> that <,,> many of these issues <,,> which
have been raised in the debate <,,> they are taken care of adequately <,> in
the budget <,> that I presented <,> in <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#103:2:B>
Before I reply <,,> to the various points that have been raised in
the debate <,,> I would like madam <,,> to draw the attention of this august
house <,,> to <,> the basic objectives <,,> of the budget as outlined in my
budget speech <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#104:2:B>
I will state six basic objectives <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#105:2:B>
The first one <,,> to bring about a greater sense of fiscal
deficit <,,> and to that extent <,> and fiscal deficit has to be reduced <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#106:2:B>
Two <,,> the rooms for many facilities made possible <,,> by
insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months <,> has to be used to step
up investments <,> and expenditure <,> particularly on anti-poverty <,>
programmes and on social services <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#107:2:B>
Three <,,> we should plan for a strong industrial recovery <,> in
ninety-three ninety-four <,> leading to a great boom <,> in succeeding years
of the <,> Eighth Five year plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#108:2:B>
Four <,> we must set the pace with steps to form <,> towards a
simpler tax system with moderate rate <,> and greater purpose <,> on
voluntary <?> complaint </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#109:2:B>
Five <,> full force must be given <,> to agriculture <,> agro
pertaining activities because agriculture after all <,> is the foundation of
our economic growth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#110:2:B>
Six <,> we must devise a policy <,> in one <,> which gives export
<,,> the highest possible emphasis making it <,> truly <,,> international
endeavour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#111:2:B>
It is against this background that I would like <,> this house <,>
to judge whether the budget meets the challenge <,> uh of the time or not
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#112:2:B>
As I mentioned Madam <,,> there has been concern <,,> about
inflation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#113:2:B>
I heard the concern <,,> of the members of this house <,,> with
regards to inflation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#114:2:B>
But we must also look at the improvement that has come about <,>
in <,> the inflation situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#115:2:B>
Mr Balanandan <,> referred to various statistics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#116:2:B>
I don't want to go into <,> various statistical squibble <,> but I
challenge everybody <,> that by any yardstick whether if you mention the
average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation <,> whether you
mention <,> the whether you take the <w> consumers' </w> price index for
industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers <,> or
wholesale price index <,> on every considerable index <,> in this last year
<,> there has been a distinct <,> very credible improvement on the inflation
front <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#117:2:B>
We are today <,> on a point to point basis <,> with inflation rate
of no more than six point four percent <,> which is a trend rate of growth
<,> if you look at the past forty years <,> of Indian economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#118:2:B>
I am not satisfied <,> with this performance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#119:2:B>
I believe <,> in the next <,,> two years <,> India must gain hike
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#120:2:B>
Today the rest of the world <,> uh do does not tolerate an
inflation rate of more than three to four percent

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#121:2:B>
You must therefore have the ambition <,> to bring our inflation
rate further down <,> and that means <,> there must be greater fiscal
discipline <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#122:2:B>
We must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation <,> and
this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of G D P <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#123:2:B>
Next year we must reduce it to four <,> or even below <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#124:2:B>
That is the only way <,> we can bring down inflation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#125:2:B>
The experience of last <,,> one year clearly brings out two things
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#126:2:B>
First of all <,> if you want to control inflation <,> we must have
a strong sense of fiscal discipline <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#127:2:B>
Second the supplying side of the economy <,> must be <,> well
managed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#128:2:B>
And last year we clearly saw <,> despite administering <O> one
word </O> and prices of fertilisers <,> despite increasing in prices of <O>
one word </O> commodities <,> and steel and coal <,> and petroleum products
inflation rate was brought down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#129:2:B>
And that brings infact <,> to the supreme necessity <,> of keeping
the fiscal system <,> in good shape <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#130:2:B>
The Central government has made <,> the sincere effort <,> in the
last twenty-two months <,> to bring the fiscal house in order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#131:2:B>
I <,> I urge <,> that the State government need to do the same
thing <,> because there are today in the state sector <,> several public
sector enterprises <,> particularly state Electricity Board <,> state Road
Transport Corporation <,> Irrigation Department <,> which are a next burden
on the exchequer of the state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#132:2:B>
Several honourable members <,> referred to a need to increase
investment in agriculture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#133:2:B>
I hear that concern <,> but agriculture basically is a state
subject <,> and you cannot increase investment in agriculture <,> if state
finances remain in such shambles as they are

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#134:2:B>
If we lose roughly six thousand <indig> crores </indig> <,> on
electricity generation in our country <,> the national goal <,> is a minimum
rate of return <,> of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#135:2:B>
But <,> as again three percent goes <,> last year we <,> had
combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over
twenty-one percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#136:2:B>
Launches of state electricity board <,> amount to six thousand
<indig> crores </indig> per annum

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#137:2:B>
We need power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#138:2:B>
Without power there can be no meaningful economic development

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#139:2:B>
And yet <,> how is this country <,> going to find the sources for
the generation of power <,> if the power sector is being sore on it

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#140:2:B>
And to have <,> year after year losses as high <,> as six thousand
<indig> crores </indig> per annum

<ICE-IND:S1B-054#141:2:B>
So I urge members <,> honourable members that we must evolve a
viable national consensus <,> for sound fiscal management of our economy <,>
</I>
