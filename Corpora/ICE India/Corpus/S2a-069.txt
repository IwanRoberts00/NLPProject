<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#1:1:A>
It is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt
<,> that is main point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#2:1:A>
My Lord in this case <,,> that only <-> this was </-> there <+> were
</+> two witness from the society <,,> uh the P W six and P W seven

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#3:1:A>
Now P W seven <,> only he pointed out there are three watchmen are
there My Lord <,,> three watchmen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#4:1:A>
Only he stated three watchmen <,> uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#5:1:B>
Two <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#6:1:A>
Two two

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#7:1:B>
There are uh one he includes that the <}> <-> watchmens </->
<+> watchmen </+> </}> are here in the society <,> from the north

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#8:1:A>
No when I come to read this thing no ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#9:1:B>
So data should be <,> of three watchmen <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#10:1:A>
No that I come to look at and then that <,> what <,,> idea in
the mind <w> you've </w> got then I am going to come to that point my lord
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#11:1:A>
Uh if there are three watchmen <-> are there </-> then I put the
specific question Mr <@> Pimpulkar </@> <,> did you <}> <-> recorded </-> <+>
record </+> </}> the statement of the if there were any watchman first point
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#12:1:A>
He says he has not recorded <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#13:1:A>
Secondly nobody has <}> <-> from </-> <=> from </=> </}> the
society <,,> or watchman <,> or P W six or P W seven

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#14:1:A>
This is a registered premises given <,> <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=>
</}> these three watchmen <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#15:1:A>
They are residing together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#16:1:A>
And second thing they could <,> the would <+> be </+> possibles
have to prove <,> the watchman should come and make a statement before the
police officer or before the court <,> that <,> <indig> ke </indig> we are
residing there along with this accused person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#17:1:A>
We are residing the <,> this <,,> we are three watchmen of this
building <,,> uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#18:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#19:1:A>
<indig> Nahi </indig> uh <,> <}> <-> <.> que que </.> </-> <=>
question </=> </}> if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of
the any watchman <,> he say <quote> No </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#20:1:A>
So it is burden of the prosecution that <,> to establish the guilt
on <}> <-> uh <.> accu </.> </-> <=> this accused </=> </}> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#21:1:A>
Here the watchman has to come say <quote> Yes this accused was
residing there </quote> <,> when this article seven was seized <,> then <}>
<-> no no </-> <+> not </+> </}> any watchman has pointed this is a shirt
which belongs to accused number <.> s </.> this article belongs to this
accused <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#22:1:A>
There there is no evidence at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#23:1:A>
Only the <-> only </-> shirt was found <,> and then only on suspect
<,> they drawn the inference my lord <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#24:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#25:1:A>
This is one aspect so there is no connection with the this
shirt with the accused <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#26:1:A>
When uh <,> when this shirt was searched <,> <}> <-> <.> se </.>
</-> <=> sealed </=> </}> with <,> when shirt was taken under the <indig>
panchnama </indig> my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#27:1:A>
Now now <,> now next point <,,> uh next point my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#28:1:A>
Only P W six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them <,,>
when this article seven <w> I'll </w> argue only on this point <,> article
seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#29:1:A>
When this shirt was shown to them they identified <,,> so question
was put up <,> before showing this shirt <quote> <-> <.> Whe </.> </-> <->
Did you </-> Have <+> you </+> given description of this shirt <,> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#30:1:A>
They said <quote> No we have not given description of shirt <,,>
</quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#31:1:A>
Now page twenty my lord <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#32:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#33:1:A>
Page twenty my lord <}> <-> <.> pa </.> </-> <=> para </=>
</}> six <,> page <,> page two two zero <,> when he was cross examined I want
that part my lord <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#34:1:A>
Para para two <,> para two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#35:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#36:1:A>
My lord may I read with your permission

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#37:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#38:1:A>
I have maintained a register of society employees

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#39:1:A>
The employees would not provide any any form <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#40:1:A>
I will not give them the description of clothes of the accused <,,>
in my statement before the police <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#41:1:A>
So I do not recollect whether article shown to me in the <?>
possession </?> of <indig> panchas </indig> known by the police <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#42:1:A>
Article shown to me I had not checked up the label of mark of shirt
article and the article shown to me <,> by police it was not taken out of
sealed packet <,> article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown
to me <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#43:1:A>
With with great respect to my submission <,> there are two things
from the <,> two things maybe gathered from this this evidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#44:1:A>
Before showing this there there is no description <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#45:1:A>
Second point when this shirt was shown <quote> He doesn't <,> he
doesn't he he <}> <-> do </-> <+> does </+> </}> not remember <,> whether
such <,,> whether shirt was shown in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig>
<,> or not <,> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#46:1:A>
So therefore it <+> is </+> inadmissable under section one
sixty-two <,> <.> ci ci </.> Evidence Act <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#47:1:A>
Because if it should be

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#48:1:B>
Shirt was not taken in the hand of <,,> in the presence of two
<,> two <indig> panchas </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#49:1:A>
No no they did not when <,> when statement was recorded <.>
inst </.> of the P W six <,> and P W seven <,> and shirt was shown but it was
not shown in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#50:1:A>
This <,> this uh uh article seven <,> this affects article <,>
which it was not shown in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig> <,>
therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#51:1:B>
Hence the statement must be <,> seized and statement was
recorded by by <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#52:1:A>
It was recorded <,> when the subsequent shirt was shown to
them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#53:1:A>
So so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the
presence of <indig> panchas </indig> or not <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#54:1:B>
Whether these shirts

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#55:1:A>
Article seven

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#56:1:B>
Ah ha

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#57:1:A>
Whether it was shown to in the presence of <indig> panchas
</indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#58:1:B>
What

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#59:1:A>
Shown

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#60:1:B>
It shown

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#61:1:A>
Shown disclosed

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#62:1:B>
Whether this shirt

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#63:1:A>
Sir was

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#64:1:B>
Or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown
in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig> P W six and P W and seven

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#65:1:A>
Seven yes my lord

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#66:1:B>
You wanted to prove that article should be shown in the
presence of <indig> panchas </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#67:1:A>
<indig> Panchas </indig> yes my lord

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#68:1:B>
In the presence of <indig> panchas </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#69:1:A>
If <,> if it is <,> if it does show on then it is hit hit by
under one section sixty-two my lord <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#70:1:C>
If it is sealed earlier <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> then it should be
sealed should be opened opened in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig>
and then only it can be shown

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#71:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#72:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#73:1:A>
Well uh we <,> now <,> that that is one of <,,> if it is this shirt
now their case is <,> there when this shirt was <,> first <,,> taken under
charge of <indig> panchnama </indig> <,,> by the <indig> panch </indig>
number two <,> uh P W two <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#74:1:A>
And it is their case it was sealed <,> if it is sealed <,,> if it
is so sealed <,,> the seal should be <}> <-> <.> b br </.> </-> <=> broken
</=> </}> in the presence of <indig> panchas </indig> and uh <,> and this
shirt should be shown in the <.> pr </.> <,> shown to in in the presence of
<indig> panchas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#75:1:A>
That is that is one aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#76:1:A>
I <.> sugge </.> after showing this shirt <,> there there was no
sealing <,> that is most important my lord <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#77:1:A>
Because this <,> this shirt was shown to them <,> there were no
sealing and subsequently sent to C A my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#78:1:A>
After later days <,> so many days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#79:1:A>
That is one point <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#80:1:A>
My lord P W seven <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#81:1:B>
After showing this shirt <{1> <[1> uhm <,> to P W uh six and
seven <{2> <[2> uh <,> you normally your witness is one zero two

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#82:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> <{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#83:1:A>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#84:1:A>
Only two <,> six <,> two is

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#85:1:B>
Apart from P W number six and seven it was not shown to the
others

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#86:1:A>
No there there other <indig> panchas </indig> were there my
lord <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#87:1:B>
<O> One word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#88:1:A>
No they they would be just

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#89:1:B>
Article seven apart from <O> a few words </O> <&> interruption
</&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#90:1:A>
So only they want to they they established that the article
seven in connection with three my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#91:1:A>
So with my respectful seven that <,> the P W six or seven they
admitted possession <,> before showing this shirt they have not given
description of article <,> if it is not given description article <,> and it
would not show in the <,> in the <.> pre </.> <-> if it sealed <,,> </-> If
it is sealed it this seal was not <}> <-> <.> br br </.> </-> <=> broken </=>
</}> in their presence <,,> in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness
about this <,> prosecution

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#92:1:A>
That is one aspect <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#93:1:A>
Now my lord whether further if I may take <,> further evidence my
lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#94:1:A>
That <,> if P W two is <}> <-> <.> mo </.> </-> <=> most </=> </}>
important of the prosecution witness <,,> P W two <,> <@> Solid </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#95:1:A>
Now <,> page nine my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#96:1:A>
Page nine cross section para two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#97:1:A>
Para two my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#98:1:A>
My <.> L i </.> if <,> when question was put <,,> when this article
seven <,> is there any passivity mark <,> <}> <-> <.> man </.> </-> <=>
manufacturing </=> </}> mark <,,> manufacturing mark <,> this <,> <w> I'll
</w> read my lord the fourth <,> uh uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#99:1:B>
Manufacturing mark of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#100:1:A>
Means there is need no <,> label mark label mark <,> this
shirt was <,> there is some marking on this <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#101:1:C>
Trade mark

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#102:1:A>
Trade marks <,> so that I I <,> trade mark <,> trade <.> tra
</.> if it is really <,> taken under <indig> panchanama </indig> they might
pointed out before in the <indig> panchanama </indig> <,> this is <?> nino
</?> mark that it is not so mentioned in the <indig> panchanama </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#103:1:A>
This there is no reference of manufacturing label <?> nino </?>
article seven in exhibit eight <,> similar shirts shirts like this are freely
available in the market <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#104:1:A>
So this there is <,> I now say <indig> panchanama </indig> was
explain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#105:1:A>
Now my lord the there is one point <,> so <,> similar question
were put up P W six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks <,>
whether did you point out in <indig> panchanama </indig> uh or in your
statement or in <indig> panchanama </indig> they said nothing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#106:1:A>
My lord <,> now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#107:1:A>
Now my lord <,> P W two further says when this shirt was found on
the flooring <,,> it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police
with the pen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#108:1:A>
The shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#109:1:A>
So it is presumed that the return must have must have done <,,> at
that time in the premises my lord <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#110:1:A>
That is one aspect <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#111:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#112:1:A>
That is <,,> with uh <,> why it is very important <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#113:1:A>
This is <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> incidence of the <indig>
panchanama </indig> on twenty-seventh July ninety-one

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#114:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#115:1:A>
That is there case it was sealed mark everything,

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#116:1:A>
Now my lord <,> if it so my lord <,> then this <,> when they are
searching <,> at that time nobody was there only <indig> panchas </indig>
were there <,,> uh shirt was taken sealed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#117:1:A>
Now with this <,> we we come to evidence of P W one most important

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#118:1:A>
P W one <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#119:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#120:1:A>
Page two my lord <,> from sixth line bottom <,,>

<$B>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#122:1:A>
Uh page two

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#124:1:A>
Page two page number two examination chief <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#125:1:B>
Where that <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#126:1:A>
Well nineth line from bottom <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#127:1:A>
Nineth line from bottom <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#128:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#129:1:A>
Police visited the watchman room <,,> seize the <-> bloods
</-> blood stained clothes from under the cot <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#130:1:A>
These clothes were brought up before the police officer these
clothes also packed which which were which were brought from the watchman
room <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#131:1:A>
If it is so <,> if it is sealed how it is brought from the when
this incident happened in flat <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#132:1:A>
And this was shown to the this this <?> part </?> of <indig> panch
panch </indig> at uh scene of offence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#133:1:A>
Once if it is sealed <,> if it is sealed <,> then how it is being
brought <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#134:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-069#135:1:A>
It disturbs it get disturbs and I may be I am not clear <,>
for the example my lord <,> if this one packet here is sealed <,> and if I
point to that <,,> opened it <,> if it if it <+> is </+> not sealed it is
easily we may shown if it <,> if it is <,> if it is sealed it should be <,,>
so so their connection in this <.> P </.> evidence of P W one and P W two sir
it is inconsistence evidence with regard to them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#136:1:A>
With <,,> if it is sealed then how it is shown <,,> it was already
sealed <,,> that is that is one aspect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-069#137:1:A>
