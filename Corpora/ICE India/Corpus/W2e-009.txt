<h> <bold> <w> Farooq's </w> worries </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#2:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> Prime Minister Mr.
Vishwanath Pratap Singh has categorically stated that his government was not
the least interested in the dismissal of the National Conference-Congress-I
alliance Government of Dr. Farooq Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#3:1>
In fact, he has maintained that such a move would be against the
avowed principles of the National Front Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#4:1>
So far so good, because for the Centre it is always a matter of
convenience to dismiss the State Governments.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#5:1>
However, Mr. Singh must be given credit where it lies.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#6:1>
He has kept away from initiating the dismissal of Congress-I ruled
States in the country and instead hold elections in such States when due.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#7:1>
The Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah could now
look forward to carry on his alliance government for a full term, if normal
conditions prevail in the valley.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#8:1>
The recent happenings in the valley, however, are not very
reassuring.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#9:1>
The kidnapping of Dr. Rubiya Sayeed, the daughter of the Union Home
Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed was in fact a flash point of growing
mal-administration in the valley.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#10:1>
The secessionist forces in the valley made their presence felt in
no uncertain terms and even the Centre had to bow down to the dictates of the
extremists while obtaining the freedom of the Union Home <w> Minsiter's
</w> daughter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#11:1>
It is rather unfortunate that secessionist forces in the valley
have been enjoying larger mass support and the Abdullah administration has
neither the means nor the will to contain them.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#12:1>
Even in the past, secessionist forces had been very active in the
valley but of late their strength has gone up alarmingly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#13:1>
So much so that even a section of the Kashmir press had been playing
into their hands.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#14:1>
What Dr. Abdullah could not achieve by way of containing it, he tried
to get the Kashmir Special Powers ( Press) Bill enacted.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#15:1>
Good sense, however, prevailed on him and the Bill was dropped at the
instance of the Press Council of India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#16:1>
The options before Dr. Abdullah, therefore are clear.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#17:1>
He has to administer the State with a firm hand and while doing so he
must ensure that the valley also finds its economic moorings.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#18:1>
The militants in the valley do not seem to let Dr. Abdullah have a
peaceful sleep. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#19:1>
<h> <bold> Great community </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#20:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> ALTHOUGH </smallcaps> </bold> in terms of size it
is small, the Parsi community in India is indeed a great one.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#21:1>
It has now the joy of playing host to the Fifth World Zoroastrian
Congress in Bombay, its hometown of the modern era. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#22:1>
The Parsi community is the one that has never been a problem for
any other people.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#23:1>
But oddly enough, it is faced with a serious problem for itself.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#24:1>
Its worry is its very survival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#25:1>
True, it cannot be said that good things never perish.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#26:1>
But history shows that good things do have an inbuilt capacity, a
potential for lasting long.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#27:1>
The Parsis can surely find comfort in this universal observation.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#28:1>
From the day of their arrival in India in quest of a new home,
the Parsis have all along remained loyal to this country and have served her
most nobly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#29:1>
Madame Bhikaji Cama, Dadabhoy Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, K.F.
Nariman and others from the Parsi community formed the front line of
leadership during the freedom movement and later the Tatas have become a
household word because of their leadership in the industrial development
of the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#30:1>
Even though very strongly influenced by the West, the Parsis have
not lost their moorings in this country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#31:1>
The people of the country, too, have always held them in high esteem,
both for their contribution to the <w> nation's </w> all round progress and
also for the philosophy of their religion, Zoroastrianism.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#32:1>
The Zoroastrian texts should certainly be translated into all
languages so that the philosophy of the religion could reach a larger
audience not only in this country but also the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#33:1>
As for the <w> community's </w> worry over its dwindling size,
one of the positive steps could be early marriage by their youth.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#34:1>
This is not to suggest child marriage, but marriages at a
reasonably young age.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#35:1>
Ofcourse, it is for the leaders and members of the community to find
a solution that would help solve the problem. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#36:1>
Meanwhile, the community should let its creative genius blossom
in various fields of activity as indeed it has in the past.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#37:1>
But all that apart, let the Parsis keep up their reputation of being
always a good company! </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Postal Bill </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#39:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> IN </smallcaps> </bold> spite of much criticism
from various sections of our people, even apart from the Opposition, the
earlier Union Ministry had pushed through Parliament the unpleasant
measure of the Indian Post Offices Amendment Bill, seeking to confer power
on specified authorities to intercept postal articles.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#40:2>
The former President, Mr. Zail Singh had not given his assent to it
and now on a request from the Prime Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, the President,
Mr. R. Venkataraman has returned the Bill to Parliament for reconsideration.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#41:2>
This is as it should be.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#42:2>
During a warlike emergency, a measure for intercepting postal
articles and mail can be understood as part of censorship measures.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#43:2>
But any such move at other times could certainly be objected to even
on grounds of upholding the right of privacy of the individual. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#44:2>
Much closer study of the subject of the freedom of the individual
and the possible curtailment of it through subtler ways of checks on carriers
of information, like interception of postal articles, tapping of telephones,
jamming radio communication and cross-beaming of satellite channels, has been
made in other countries.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#45:2>
Those keen on upholding the freedom of expression and other
fundamental freedoms have cautioned against ingenious means which the ruling
powers might contrive in this age of science and technology to interfere with
personal freedoms of those opposed to the ruling authorities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#46:2>
The point is that a legislation might look necessary to meet an
exigency.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#47:2>
Even so, a very careful thought must be given to any kind of
legislation that is likely to be abused and misused either by the existing
Government or the succeeding regimes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#48:2>
An alert Government normally has enough powers to prevent mischief
even without taking recourse to controversial legislative measures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#49:2>
In fact, in our country the Supreme Court has said that a
restriction is reasonable only when there is a proper balance between the
rights of the individual and those of the society.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#50:2>
A restriction must not be greater than the mischief to be prevented.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#51:2>
As such, it is only proper that the said Postal Bill should be
subjected to a fuller scrutiny of Parliament again. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#52:2>
<h> <bold> An experimental side </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#53:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> FOR </smallcaps> </bold> the first time, the
Indian Cricket selectors have shown foresight and boldness in selecting a
team which is full of promising youngsters.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#54:2>
Raj Singh Dungarpur and his colleagues no doubt would earn praise
for pinning faith on youngsters who have done remarkably well in the home
competitions in recent years, though their action in sacking Krishnamachari
Srikkanth from Captaincy and again from the team may not be to the liking of
cricket lovers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#55:2>
Perhaps the selectors were deeply impressed by the success of the
young members of the team that recently toured Pakistan to draw the four
match Test series.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#56:2>
The selectors have not only brought a young man to lead the team for
the seven-week New Zealand tour but have infused fresh blood with an eye on
the future of Indian cricket.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#57:2>
As Raj Singh has himself said, the team has been chosen for the
nineties.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#58:2>
The youngsters under Azharuddin must take this opportunity and
establish their worth in the team. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#59:2>
It is going to be a challenging tour.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#60:2>
For the first time in Indian cricket, we have a cricket Manager in
Bishen Singh Bedi, who should be able to help the youngsters.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#61:2>
Perhaps, the selectors realised that New <w> Zealand's </w> status in
international cricket today is not that strong or formidable and decided
to send an experimental side.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#62:2>
The selectors need to be complimented for this excellent move, for
our senior stars like Ravi Shastri, Srikkanth and others had failed miserably
on the West Indies and Pakistan tours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#63:2>
However, we still feel, a place could have been found for Dilip
Vengasarkar, who has done well in home competitions after withdrawing from
the Pakistan tour.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#64:2>
<w> Raj Singh's </w> rather strange argument that his decision to
withdraw from the Pakistan tour has gone against Vengasarkar, does not
sound convincing.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#65:2>
Are we to understand that no player should opt out of a tour? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#66:2>
This is the first time that such a young side is chosen for a
foreign tour and it would be unfair to cast aspersions on their abilities as
international cricketers.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#67:2>
Players like Sanjay Manjrekar, Sachin Tendulkar and Navjot Sidhu have
proved themselves and there is no reason as to why one should not expect the
new members of the team to come out with flying colours. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#68:3>
<h> <bold> New Governors </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#69:3>
</bold> T</bold><smallcaps>HE</smallcaps> sweeping changes made
in the occupants of the <indig> Raj Bhavans </indig> in the country is an
indication of the belief of the National Front Government in the US-like
system of sharing the spoils.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#70:3>
The earlier approach was to look to the Governors for continuity of
administration at the level of overall supervision.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#71:3>
No exception could be taken to that approach but the fact that cannot
be denied is that during the recent years a situation was brought about to
make the Governors merely dummies of the powers that be at the Centre.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#72:3>
In fact, even a President had to deny that he was a <quote> " rubber
stamp" </quote> ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#73:3>
It is also true that while some of the Governors conducted
themselves with such high dignity, that they were an automatic choice for
appointment as ambassadors to key nations of the world, others betrayed a
marked lack of maturity and invited criticism from all quarters.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#74:3>
Andhra Pradesh, in particular, had a bitter taste of the latter kind.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#75:3>
In a way, therefore, the National Front Government cannot be blamed
much for making fresh appointments in almost all the States. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#76:3>
Even so, what the Union Government has now done might create the
impression that only a few Governors really did justice to the responsibility
entrusted to them, for they have been retained in the same States or
transferred to some others.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#77:3>
The rest have been replaced.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#78:3>
The latter might appear to have been viewed with disfavour, of
course, with the exception of some who were about to retire in the normal
course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#79:3>
However, unlike the earlier appointments, when Governors were
chosen either to get rid of some unwanted persons from the Union Cabinet or
from the higher echelons of the ruling party, the new appointments speak
for a choice made on the basis of experience, maturity and administrative
ability in most of the cases.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#80:3>
It should be noted that Mr. P.C. Alexander has been retained as the
Governor of Tamil Nadu and Prof. Nurul Hassan has been shifted back to West
Bengal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#81:3>
Maharashtra, in particular, is fortunate to have Mr. C.
Subramaniam as its new Governor.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#82:3>
He is without doubt one of the elder statesmen in the country and an
administrator of proven ability.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#83:3>
The State administration will have the benefit of his experience in
tackling its proplems in the fast changing times. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#84:3>
<h> <bold> The fight within </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#85:3>
<bold> <smallcaps> AS </smallcaps> </bold> the D-Day for filling
nominations to the State Assembly elections is approaching, there seems to be
growing dissidence among the Congress-I rank and file.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#86:3>
There is little doubt that the Assembly elections this time are going
to be a crucial affair and the Congress-I would be facing the toughest of
times.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#87:3>
The Shiv Sena-BJP combine is facing the party squarely in the face
and this is going to be a big challenge to the party.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#88:3>
At such a juncture, it was expected that the ruling party would
close its rank and face the challenge unitedly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#89:3>
Apparently, the unity move within the party itself is facing a
challenge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#90:3>
The formation of the new <quote> " Maharashtra Samantar (
parallel) Congress" </quote> by Mr. Raibhan Jadhav, a senior party
functionary and a director of sugar factory from Aurangabad goes to prove it
further.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#91:3>
Mr. Jadhav has claimed that 47 present and former MLAs from
Maharashtra have backed this new party and if Mr. Jadhav is to be
believed, the new party would field more than 100 candidates against the
official nominees of the party in the ensuring State Assembly elections.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#92:3>
It is doubtful if the new party would pose any serious threat to the
official nominees of the party but it certainly goes to prove that everything
is not well within the party at the crucial moment of Assembly election. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#93:3>
The recent Mayoral elections at Nagpur also saw open rebellion in
the party.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#94:3>
The election of a rebel candidate has made matters worse in the
<w> party's </w> standing in the city, which has so far stood solidly by the
Congress-I.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#95:3>
The official list of the Congress-I nominees would be out by the time
these lines appear but it is almost certain that all sections of the partymen
would not be satisfied with the final list and there would be much heart
burning in the rank and file of the party. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-009#96:3>
The happenings within the past week do not augur well for the
party but since the Chief Minister, Mr. Pawar, has been reported to have
walked away with a major chunk of tickets for his own supporters it should be
his endeavour to win over the dissidents and re-group the warring factions to
face the Assembly polls.

<ICE-IND:W2E-009#97:3>
He must see the writing on the wall. </p> </I>
