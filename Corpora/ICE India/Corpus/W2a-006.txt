<ICE-IND:W2A-006#3:1>
<indig> Shri </indig> A. B. Latthe in his <quote> ` Memoirs'
</quote> has given a graphic description of the occasion when <indig> Shri
Shahu Chhatrapati </indig> became a grandfather : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#4:1>
<quote> " His Highness became a grand father at 1-30 p.m. on
April 4, 1910, when Her Highness the <indig> Ranisaheb </indig> of Dewas gave
birth to a son at Kolhapur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#5:1>
This joyful news spread all over the town and the public expressed
their joy in various ways.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#6:1>
<it> Gudhyas </it> were erected, <it> Toranas </it> were hung and
several dishes of sweetmeats were distributed by various communities in the
town.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#7:1>
His Highness, the <indig> Rajasaheb </indig> of Dewas accompanied by
his brother <indig> Shrimant </indig> Bhausaheb and others arrived at
Kolhapur on the 8th April, 1910 for celebration of the <indig> <it> Barse
</it> </indig> Ceremony.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#8:1>
The ceremony of naming the child was performed with great pomp on the
21st of the same month and the child was named <quote> " Vikram Sinha"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#9:1>
In commemoration of this event, all offices and schools were given
a holiday.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#10:1>
A few of the prisoners were released and remissions granted to
others.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#11:1>
Thus the Princess of Kolhapur gave to Dewas its heir-apparent and
became herself the mother of another royal house." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 1
</sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#12:1>
It would be interesting to know what Shahu <indig> Maharaj
</indig> felt as a grandfather, since it throws, I think significant light
upon his character, as a person.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#13:1>
Naturally, these feelings could be better understood at the time of
parting, when his grandson was to leave for Dewas from Kolhapur. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#14:1>
Shahu <indig> Maharaj </indig> had taken all the care of his
grandson at Kolhapur; he had appointed an English nurse to take care of his
grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#15:1>
<quote> " I would like to know whether Your Highness will like to
have the English nurse for a couple of months" </quote> , he wrote to his
son-in-law, <quote> " Her time will be over in September.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#16:1>
If you do not like to keep her I shall dispense with her services but
if you want her, a fresh agreement will have to be made with her after
September." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#17:1>
Shahu <indig> Chhatrapati </indig> was deeply concerned about
the health and care of his grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#18:1>
He even showed great concern about the building in which his grandson
would stay at Dewas.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#19:1>
<quote> " But one thing I can tell you now and that is he must have
lots of fresh air in the house otherwise he gets bronchitis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#20:1>
Your New Palace or guest house will do or the court house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#21:1>
But for <w> god's </w> sake do not take him to the Old Palace."
</quote> <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#22:1>
In the next letter he seems to have revised his opinion about the
New Palace.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#23:1>
He says, <quote> " I think court house <O> <&> page </&> 62 </O> is
the best house and best ventilated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#24:1>
Is not the part of the New Palace ready ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#25:1>
If it is just finished it will not do, because the walls give out
cold and damp." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#26:1>
He was painfully aware of the limitations of his daughter in
becoming a good mother to his grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#27:1>
<quote> " I am sorry to say that the poor child is motherless having
a mother as my daughter who does not know even how to suckle him.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#28:1>
It is neither the fault of the mother nor of the child.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#29:1>
It is <w> god's </w> pleasure" </quote> <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#30:1>
This was also an additional factor in his great concern for the
grandson. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#31:1>
He was ready to send his <quote> " wife with the grandson for a
few days till you are able to arrange confidently." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 6
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#32:1>
As a matter of fact he did send his wife.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#33:1>
<quote> " I have sent my wife and brother with my grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#34:1>
I request Your Highness not to keep my wife more than two weeks."
</quote> <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#35:1>
In Kolhapur it was the <indig> Ranisaheb </indig> that looked after
her grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#36:1>
<quote> " Not to say much about my wife, you will find from your own
servants and maid-servants that she hardly sleeps at night.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#37:1>
All the meals of the baby are prepared by her." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 8
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#38:1>
And again, <quote> " You will be surprised to know that my wife
serves your child like a nurse.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#39:1>
She does not allow the maid to light <indig> <it> Shegadi </it>
</indig> , for her.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#40:1>
She does it with her own hands that neither smoke nor ashes should
spoil the milk." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#41:1>
<quote> " Of course she does it for her own grandson" </quote> ,
Shahu <indig> Maharaj </indig> continues, <quote> " but if it was not for a
son-in-law like you I should not have sent her to Dewas nor as a grandson we
should have loved him like this but we love him the more because for having a
son-in-law like you." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 10 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#42:1>
Shahu <indig> <w> Maharaja's </w> </indig> feelings about his
son-in-law are fully expressed when he says, <quote> " I look upon you as
more than my son." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#43:1>
The <indig> <w> Maharaja's </w> </indig> love for his grandson was
so great that he felt that he should himself bring up the child, but he
knew that it would not be right since he felt that it was more natural for
the child to be brought <+> up </+> by its parents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#44:1>
His love for his grandson was counter-balanced by his respect for the
feelings of others, especially his son-in-law.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#45:1>
And it was the latter that prevailed with him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#46:1>
<quote> " With your experience if you find you are unable to take
care of the child, with the consent of your wife, you may send the child back
with my wife and my daughter, of course, will stop in Dewas as the child
won't feel her absence.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#47:1>
He may remain with us until he gets his teeth and he begins to eat
solid food.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#48:1>
Then we do not want him any more.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#49:1>
Teething is the time when we have to be most careful about the child.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#50:1>
I think young men are not very particular about children but are so
of their wives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#51:1>
The only thing is that I look upon you as more than my son and that
therefore you should neither feel shy nor in the least hesitate to send the
child back if you feel the slightest difficulty." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 12
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#52:1>
In another letter written a few days later, Shahu <indig> Maharaj
</indig> says, <quote> " Let me assure my dear son-in-law, neither my wife
nor myself shall feel least sorry if the child remains with you.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#53:1>
We want you to learn to take care of the child.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#54:1>
Naturally my wife feels the parting but from her heart she would like
to see your son with you unless you feel from your heart that she should take
him until he gets teeth and eats food.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#55:1>
But if you can take care so much the better." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 13
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#56:1>
Moreover, in a separate letter written to his brother <O> <&> page
</&> 63 </O> he wrote, <quote> " Don't displease <indig> Rajesaheb </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#57:1>
Be stern with my wife.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#58:1>
Keep the child there if <indig> Rajesaheb </indig> wants him."
</quote> <fnr> <sp> 14 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#59:1>
The party with the grandson of Shahu <indig> Maharaj </indig>
left Kolhapur by a special train and immediately he wrote a letter to his
son-in-law to avoid <quote> " any tom tom" </quote> for his wife.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#60:1>
<quote> " If you write about procession, I shall be very sorry,
because myself any my wife consider Dewas quite as our house.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#61:1>
That is why we are intruding upon you without being asked for
invitation." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 15 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#62:1>
The simplicity and affectionate nature of Shahu <indig> Maharaj
</indig> and his wife and his dislike of publicity, noted by Sir S. M. Fraser
also,<fnr> <sp> 16 </sp> </fnr> are evident from these letters written in
English. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#63:1>
The affection that he felt towards his grandson was immense.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#64:1>
<quote> " Let me tell you that if I love in this world anybody more
than even myself, my daughter, son or brothers, it is my grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#65:1>
He is very sprightly and always laughing." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 17
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#66:1>
When he received the news of his <w> grandson's </w> arrival at Dewas
he wrote to his son-in-law, <quote> " I hope you are quite pleased with your
son; he is a very playful boy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#67:1>
Just after your morning meals get him out and let him roll, on the
bed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#68:1>
That is the way to enjoy your children.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#69:1>
I did the same with my grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#70:1>
My missing him is beyond imagination." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 18 </sp>
</fnr> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#71:1>
<quote> " Take care of my grandson.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#72:1>
Do not hesitate to send him back if you really think it difficult to
bring him up." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 19 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#73:1>
And again, <quote> " I hope you will soon have a second son and this
little child may remain with us.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#74:1>
He is the joy of the family." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 20 </sp> </fnr>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-006#75:1>
Shahu <indig> Maharaj </indig> wanted his grandson to be with
him in Kolhapur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#76:1>
His wish was fulfilled partly in future as his grandson Vikramsinh
was educated in Rajaram College of Kolhapur and in 1947 succeeded as <indig>
Chhatrapati </indig> of Kolhapur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#77:1>
In addition to understanding Shahu <indig> Chhatrapati </indig> as a
leader and social revolutionary, it is necessary to understand him as a man.

<ICE-IND:W2A-006#78:1>
It is, therefore, I think, necessary to conduct more research in
subjects of such nature. </p>
