<ICE-IND:W2D-004#3:1>
In this critical write up on present administrative scenario, the
author brings to the fore several persistent negative traits of Indian
administrative system to justify the title of the article.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#4:1>
He also illustrates his point with reflections on recent happenings in
India-Pakistan and India-China relations. </it> </p> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#5:1>
THE USE of the term <quote> ` Public Administration' </quote>
presupposes a dominant mode of behaviour on the part of members of the state
bureaucracy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#6:1>
These bureaucrats are expected to safeguard the legitimate interests
of the public by a ceaseless exercise of adequate vigilance and expertise.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#7:1>
Public administrators are to fulfil the lawful needs of the common
people by adoption and implementation of appropriate decisions without
discriminating between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, as also
between persons who possess administrative-political influence and others who
do not possess such influence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#8:1>
Members of the state bureaucracy will, thus, promote professional
excellence and dignity, and justify the permanence of tenure as also numerous
facilities ( free from encumbrances and taxes) enjoyed by them ( especially
those in the higher echelons).

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#9:1>
Unfortunately, in India ( as in many other countries), most public
servants have failed to live up to the faith reposed in them, and thus
forfeited the eligibility for privileges heaped on them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#10:1>
Consequently, an ordinary Indian, bereft of any
administrative-political influence, is dismayed to find public administration
in India reduced to anti-public administration.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#11:1>
The rationale for a permanent tenure for civil servants becomes very
weak.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#12:1>
The case for a New Zealand-type bureaucracy, with even counterparts
of Secretaries to the Government of India being appointed on short-term
performance-related contracts, becomes quite strong. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#13:1>
<h> <it> Anti-People Attitude of Bureaucracy </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#14:1>
An ordinary person may not at every moment be deeply aware of the
anti-people characteristics of the entire state bureaucracy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#15:1>
For, normally, a person does not have the misfortune to visit at the
same point of time a police station, a law court, a government hospital or
school, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#16:1>
Consequently, he may suffer from an illusion that all government
agencies may not be anti-people.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#17:1>
But the harsh truth is, if one keeps out of account a few exceptional
agencies and a few extraordinary persons in every agency, all government (
and, to add, semi-Government) agencies are anti-people, <O> <&> page </&> 298
</O> because they are manifestly reluctant to perform the minimum of duties
in time.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#18:1>
It is largely because of the selfless and indefatigable efforts of
these exceptional agencies and functionaries that some citizens still retain
a bit of trust in the state bureaucracy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#19:1>
The number of such extraordinary functionaries cannot but dwindle
fast in a situation where, as in <indig> Mandi Parishad </indig> of Uttar
Pradesh recently, the Chief Engineer, insistent upon quality control in
public works, has been murdered by criminals thriving on nexus with
politicians and contractors.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#20:1>
Such honest officials, moreover, as long as they are alive, may
remain thoroughly demoralised.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#21:1>
Some of them take to academic / literary pursuits with great success,
and obtain relief from demoralisation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#22:1>
One even witnesses the sorry spectacle of honest police officers, who
chafe at their inability to arrest druglords ( well-known to the police and
the public), and then proceed to perform the academic chore of addressing
thousands of students in seminars on drug abuse.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#23:1>
Thus, unwittingly, these public-spirited officials further the
interests of druglords, because the majority of students, hitherto unaware of
intoxicating drugs, become curious about them, and curiosity is frequently
the first faltering step to addiction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#24:1>
Endless and familiar are the ways in which an ordinary citizen,
visiting a state or semi-state agency in quest of a perfectly legitimate
service, is subjected to tremendous harassment and / or extortion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#25:1>
Indeed, he confronts a <foreign> Kafkaesque </foreign> bureaucracy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#26:1>
It is a bureaucracy, steeped in the constitutionally prescribed creed
of socialism, and members of the higher bureaucracy feel free to get their
pension papers processed in time, but do not suffer from qualms of conscience
when they keep poor retired teachers of Government-aided schools waiting for
years, in case they are lucky to enjoy pension before death.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#27:1>
It is a great system of public administration, in which members of
superior services ( e.g., Indian Administrative Service or the Indian Foreign
Service), having spouses in the same or allied services, spend a lot of time
to ensure the posting of highly-paid couples in the same station, but do not
bother about transferring a low-paid female attendant at the J. P. Hospital
in Bhopal to a place 50 kilometers away, effectively separating her from the
husband and family. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#28:1>
<h> <it> Plethora of Rules and Regulations </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#29:1>
In a word, ordinary citizens cannot be blamed if their
predominant experiences lead them to conclude that members of the state
bureaucracy have been essentially trained to persecute the common people in
an unfair manner.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#30:1>
Numerous rules, regulations, etc., have been devised and refined for
this purpose.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#31:1>
It has been expected that adoption of modern technology will reduce
sufferings caused by such regulations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#32:1>
But the innovative capacities of Government functionaries in India
are so great that they can even harness modern machines ( e.g., computers) to
multiply the sufferings of ordinary people.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#33:1>
At an office in a state capital, for instance, a tax-payer finds the
public servant at a counter sitting idle, because the computer at his
disposal <O> <&> page </&> 299 </O> is out of order.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#34:1>
He, therefore, has to wait for an hour to transact a business that
should not take more than two or three minutes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#35:1>
He further discovered that he has been able to get the job done,
because, meanwhile, a more clever tax-payer has applied an ancient art to
make the allegedly immobile machine work.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#36:1>
He remunerates one of too many middlemen swarming the office
premises, who use a major part of this remuneration to bribe the state
functionary at the counter.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#37:1>
This functionary needs an incentive to overcome his sense of
weariness born of too little work. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#38:1>
<h> <it> Indecision at Top Level of Politicians and Administrator
</it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#39:1>
Beyond such personal afflictions, ceaseless and numerous, lie the
vast domain of enormous collective suffering imposed on helpless masses by
the failure of top level politicians-administrators to take, or even make
sincere efforts to take, timely and proper decisions on important matters.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#40:1>
For example, one can pay some attention to the working of Forest
Departments in various states.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#41:1>
These departments can be easily equated to ultra-big and thoroughly
irresponsible landlords.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#42:1>
Forest officials are entrusted with the supreme duty to harmonise
three aims.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#43:1>
One, they have to safeguard the legitimate, though limited, rights of
poor forest dwellers to the use of forest products for sheer survival.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#44:1>
Two, they have to meet the essential demands of town dwellers and
businessmen in compliance with well-defined and carefully planned
regulations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#45:1>
Three, forest officials must exercise strict vigilance to ensure that
a thoughtless use of forest resources does not disrupt the <w> country's </w>
environmental balance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#46:1>
Nevertheless, despsite the lapse of 47 years since the achievement of
Independence in 1947, the state bureaucracy has not taken firm measures to
carry out any well-formulated plan in this immeasurably important field.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#47:1>
The inevitable consequence is, dishonest politicians, businessmen and
officials, taking advantage of the dire poverty of forest dwellers, have
launched a virtual conspiracy to destroy <w> country's </w> forest resources,
and upset the overall environmental balance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#48:1>
It may not be easy in the near future to uproot this conspiracy,
because in a state like Uttar Pradesh ( rich in forest resources), an
alarmingly large number of members elected to the legislature happen to be
convicted of serious crimes, or undertrial criminals.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#49:1>
In Karnataka, again, on account of evident collusion between
politicians, officials and a mafia group, timber worth one thousand <indig>
crore </indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> has been illegally procured from
forests in recent months, whereas the Chief Minister nonchalantly affirms
that his state is free from corruption. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#50:1>
<h> <it> Crimeproneness </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#51:1>
It is inordinately significant that legislators actively engaged
in crimes or visibly dependent on criminals, not only persecute ordinary
individuals but also honest high-ranking officers ( whose number naturally
registers a rapid decline).

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#52:1>
Even those officials, who are ready to placate legislators by
sacrificing ethics, cannot escape harassment in case they are not prepared to
<O> <&> page </&> 300 </O> exercise their capacity for dishonesty beyond a
certain limit.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#53:1>
This may explain why ( as of 1994) a large number of District
Collectors and Superintendents of Police ( notably in Bihar and Uttar
Pradesh) have been subjected to penal transfers every few months.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#54:1>
Moreover, conscientious officials have ben witnesses to innumerable
cases of promotion or transfer to highly important positions, which bear no
reasonable relationship with the the performance and experience of
beneficiaries.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#55:1>
Actually, in some State secretariats, members of the higher
bureaucracy are preoccupied with gossips about such postings and promotions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#56:1>
They are undoubtedly wasting their time, but it may be dangerous on
their part to devote themselves to more fruitful activities.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#57:1>
For, one of them may take an honest action without being able to
anticipate how it can hurt the vital interests of a greedy, crime-prone
legislator.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#58:1>
The aggrieved legislator will surely retaliate by transferring the
official concerned to a demonstrably less important post inside the
Secretariat or to a place far away from the state capital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#59:1>
Such penalties, however, are insignificant in comparison to what
some honest and competent civil servants have had to suffer on account of
their determination to place professional ethics and public interest above
personal gains.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#60:1>
For example, some years back, an IAS probationer ( a close relative
of the then Prime Minister of India, who practised divide-and-rule much more
seriously but much less successfully than the British colonial rulers) was
abused of molesting a lady probationer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#61:1>
The chief of the training academy, also an IAS officer, submitted his
letter of resignation in order to press the demand of exemplary punishment
for the accused male probationer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#62:1>
Largely on account of this moral pressure exerted by the training
academy chief, the government was forced to take a disciplinary action
against the wayward IAS probationer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#63:1>
Eventually, however, this disciplinary action was <unclear> inguished
</unclear> by negligent and/or generous intervention.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#64:1>
But the government did not take any step to help the training academy
chief, who resigned and incurred unwarranted financial loss.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#65:1>
In this context one cannot resist the temptation to remember the
unbelievably anti-public stance of four <unclear> or </unclear> of five
highest judicial officers of India, who overruled the judgements of the High
Courts in the 1970s, and upheld the Emergency law suspending the right to
life and liberty granted by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#66:1>
Hoodlums of a ruling party in south India have gone so far as to
spray the face of a lady IAS officer with acid, beause this officer is not a
devotee of the cult of self-aggrandisement, and, therefore, takes some
rightful decisions, which have hurt the vital interests of the ruling party.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#67:1>
The lady has resigned from the IAS.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#68:1>
Moreover, even on matters not at all connected with the performance
of regular administrative duties, an IAS officer, or his closest relative,
may suffer from severe oppression without any lapse on his or her part.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#69:1>
The oppressors - - politicians-turned-criminals or
criminals-turned-politicians - - evade all penal actions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#70:1>
In one incident, on the <unclear> word </unclear> of a state capital,
the wife of an IAS officer is brutally molested by a well-known anti-social.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#71:1>
But some political leaders of the ruling party depend <O> <&> page
</&> 301 </O> vitally on this anti-social for winning elections.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#72:1>
After all, an honest citizen can cast only one vote, whereas such an
anti-social can cast numerous votes, and the police cannot come near him.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#73:1>
In another incident, an IAS officer, travelling by train, infuriates
a co-passenger, who is a Member of Parliament, surrounded by some companions,
including legislators of a neighbouring state.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#74:1>
He gets furious, because the IAS officer opposes his forcible entry
into a reserved compartment without any valid reservation document.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#75:1>
The companions of the Member of Parliament, carrying fire-arms,
mercilessly beat and insult the IAS officer, and try to force him out of the
train at a station, obviously to take him to a secluded place, and murder
him.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#76:1>
By sheer luck and mental strength, the IAS officer escapes kidnapping
and death.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#77:1>
But no action can be taken against the crime-prone parliamentarian
and his trigger-happy musclemen-cum-legislators. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#78:1>
<h> <it> Debasing of Values </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#79:1>
A number of to-pranking leaders of <w> India's </w> Independence
Movement were eminent lawyers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#80:1>
It was certainly feasible in their part to devise
legal-constitutional measures to prevent politicians of the above-noted
category, living on crimes or depending on criminals, from crowding
legislatures, or establishing predominance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#81:1>
But, following Independence, the top-most leaders of the ruling party
( as also the high-ranking officials of the state bureaucracy) chose not to
pay any attention to this serious problem.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#82:1>
Instead, they concentrated their political-administrative endeavours
on the following aims: to ensure that one political party won electins for
decades, by fair means or foul; to endow a coterie within this party, a
family within this coterie, and a person within the family, with unlimited
powers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#83:1>
A widespread use of the slogan of <quote> ` socialism' </quote> ,
simultaneously tantalising and confusing the people, contributed immensely to
the acquisition and conservation of these powers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#84:1>
Political leaders were tactful; they never attempted the impossible
task of defining socialism.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#85:1>
Deceptively pleasing announcements about the establishment of a
<quote> " socialistic pattern of society" </quote> - - or a reckless use of
the mask of socialism - - aided the above-noted process of over-concentration
of powers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#86:1>
Remarkably, the high-ranking members of the state bureaucracy - -
e.g., nearly all members of the ICS ( Indian Civil Service) and the IAS (
Indian Administrative Service) - - extended enthusiastic cooperation to the
accumulation of powers in the hands of a person / family / coterie within one
ruling party in New Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#87:1>
Many of these officers pretended to be votaries or spokesmen of
socialism.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#88:1>
The reason was easy to fathom.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#89:1>
The practice of socialism meant, basically, a ceaseless expansion of
the powers of the state bureaucracy, as also of the privileges enjoyed by
public administrators, which had little or no relationship with their
administrative abilities, not to speak of a rise in the standard of living of
the masses.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#90:1>
Moreover, as members of the state bureaucracy became more and more
power-hungry and privilege-addict, they extended unflinching support to the
thoroughly <O> <&> page </&> 302 </O> illegitimate activities of their
political bosses ( including gross financial irregularities ) .

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#91:1>
Consequently, in numerous public sector undertakings - - in city
transport or Indian Airlines, in steel or chemical plants, in the management
of banks or generation of electricity - - the country has suffered from
losses worth hundreds of thousands of <indig> crores </indig> of rupees due
to acts of wastage, inefficiency and corrpution that are stranger than
fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#92:1>
To take a dramatic example, 190 employees of a State-run Ceramic
Development Corporation have been enjoying salaries for a decade without (
repeat without ) doing any work.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#93:1>
No wonder that all this drives India to the verge of bankruptcy by
the end of 1980s. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-004#94:1>
When top-most politicians-administrators remain preoccupied with
self-aggrandisement, and misuse the apparatus of public administration for
his purpose, the country inevitably exposes itself to enconomic and other
disasters.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#95:1>
For, when national interests are subordinated to
personal-factional-party interest, appropriate decisions on momentous matters
are not taken in time.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#96:1>
A stitch in time saves nine.

<ICE-IND:W2D-004#97:1>
But an overpowering fixation upon narrow personal / factional
concerns generates chronic shortsightedness in decision-making, and
complicates problems in such an uncontrollable fashion that even nine
stitches may not be of much avail. </p> </I>
