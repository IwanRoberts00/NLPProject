<h> <bold> Rare Violin <indig> jugalbandi </indig> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#2:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> CONSISTANT </smallcaps> </bold> with its glory as
culturally the most active organisation the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan had
arranged a three-day Thyagaraja Music Festival last week.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#3:1>
A rare item in the series was the violin <indig> jugalbandi </indig>
with Peri Sriramamurthy playing Carnatic and P. S. Ghotikar the
Hindusthani music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#4:1>
The former is among the best violinists of the country and he proved
his mettle in <indig> Kharaharapriya ( Pakkala) </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#5:1>
Violin has not been adopted that widely in Hindusthani field and it
was not an easy task for Ghotikar to match the brilliance of Sriramamurthy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#6:1>
The choice of the <indig> raga </indig> played by the Hindusthani
violinist did not also correspond fully with <indig> Kharaharapriya
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#7:1>
He played a <indig> janya raga </indig> which would have matched
<indig> Salagabhairavi </indig> better.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#8:1>
The Carnatic version of <indig> Yamunakalyani </indig> was
classically fitting while the other one was rather lightened, with traces of
a <indig> thumri </indig> or <indig> pahadi </indig> approach.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#9:1>
Mridangist Ravi and Tablist Nagaraj gave zestful support in this
satisfying concert. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#10:1>
The most important item in any Thyagaraja Festival is the group
singing of the <indig> Pancharatna Kritis </indig> - - the five gems.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#11:1>
It was a very thoughtful idea to have a left the job to <indig> Smt.
</indig> Akhila Krishnan who presented the songs with her able disciples, in
perfect unison and understanding.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#12:1>
Noted participants in the <}> <-> trouple </-> <+> troupe </+>
</}> were Dipti Bhalla and Indira Jagadacharya.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#13:1>
The most melodious and moving part of the festival, however, was
the presentation of <w> Thyagaraja's </w> immortal <indig> Divyanama
Sankeertanams </indig> by the Guruguha Choir of Delhi on the inaugural day.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#14:1>
AIR National programme last Saturday was by Mani Krishnaswami.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#15:1>
It was about her best performance in recent times.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#16:1>
She seemed to have worked hard in rehearsing all the items to
perfection.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#17:1>
All the kriti renditions were impeccable and the concertplanning
was meticulous.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#18:1>
<indig> Alapanas </indig> of <indig> Panthuvarali ( Sankari </indig>
by Mysore Vasudevathar) and <indig> Todi </indig> had both manly weight and
feminine grace.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#19:1>
It was a pleasure to listen to <indig> Needaya </indig> , that rarely
sung <indig> Kriti </indig> in <indig> Todi </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#20:1>
It was Peri Sriramamurty here too who filled the broadcast with
steady flow of melody.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#21:1>
K. R. Ganesh <indig> ( Mridangam) </indig> and V. Suresh <indig> (
Ghatam) </indig> collaborated admirably in making the programme the success
it was.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#22:1>
Mani Krishnaswamy was on the <indig> Doordarshan </indig>
national hook-up only the other day and this national programme has come
in rather too quick in succession.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#26:2>
<bold> DR.</bold> <smallcaps> RAJA RAMANNA </smallcaps> is firstly
a physicist of international stature.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#27:2>
He is also now our Minister of State for Defence.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#28:2>
The astonishing fact is not that Dr. Ramanna plays the piano.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#29:2>
Many gifted men and women follow contrasting and sometimes mutually
contradictory interests and do passably well in these pursuits.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#30:2>
But that Dr. Ramanna plays the piano with such appeal, such a subtly
shaded touch and a pedal technique that gives his style such a dreamy
reflective quality, it is this that strikes the listeners with surprise
and pleasure. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#31:2>
At a concert sponsored by the Music Salon The Cultural Department
of the USSR Embassy in association with <indig> Swaralaya </indig> Dr. Raja
Ramanna played a selection of compositions from the Romantic tradition
beginning from this century backwards to Beethoven.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#32:2>
Pandit Ravi Shankar was the Chief Guest on the occasion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#33:2>
Dr, Ramanna opened the concert with a piece named <quote> `
Rhapsody' </quote> by the composer Erno Donhanyi, a flowery little piece full
of whimsey with shining little passages and mincing little runs on the scale.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#34:2>
Thereafter it was business right through.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#35:2>
Ramanna went into Liszt in right earnest and revealed a lustrous
technique that his duties as Minister do not seem to have touched. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#36:2>
Obviously in red hot practice, he played Liszt with a kind of
abandon beginning with the Liszt Paraphrase from Rigoletto with flying
runs on the scale with his notes seeming to be sliced as though with a
scalpel, very delicate and light despite the bloody goings on in the opera.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#37:2>
Then he went on to another Liszt, a <quote> ` benediction' </quote> ,
a three movement piece hymn-like in its utterance spreading out in placid
meadows of notes fanning out of the <w> Minister's </w> fingertips.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#38:2>
He followed this with a Beethoven Sonata, not the Moonlight, but the
F. Sharp major in two movements played in a reined-in sort of way letting
the passages tell its own tale.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#39:2>
Then there were some Chopin Preludes, which with the kind of scale
exercises that Ramanna seems to have worked on, came out with a richness
of texture that did the evening proud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#40:2>
He concluded with another Liszt.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#41:2>
What came out of the concert in no uncertain terms was the feeling
how much Dr. Ramanna cared for his art to give his playing technique that
feel of urgency which not even the duties of a Minister of Government could
diminish. </p> <&> right aligned </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#44:3>
<bold> <smallcaps> ACCOMPANYING </smallcaps> </bold> and solo
playing are skills of a different nature, each having its own advantages
and disadvantages.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#45:3>
An accompanist must be a versatile artiste who could meet a variety
of musicians of different styles on the platform while a soloist can manage
with his own crammed stuff.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#46:3>
But the soloist becomes the main performer and the responsibility
of the success or otherwise of the concert would fall on him and not so if he
were to be an accompanist.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#47:3>
A violinist would be justified in demanding a solo platfom only if he
surely has some original stuff of his own which he has no opportunity to
exhibit as an accompanist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#48:3>
Madras had been the commerical capital for Carnatic music since
the time of Patnam Subramanya Iyer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#49:3>
Most of our musicians live there more in search of limelight than for
any love of the place.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#50:3>
To have made a name in the the field while living in far off Delhi is
an achievement within the capacity of less than a handful of artistes and P.
Sunder Rajan is one of the few whose solo violin performance was featured
last week joinly by South Delhi Music Circle and Svaralaya.

<bold> <smallcaps> WHEN </smallcaps> </bold> a celebrity of the
stature of <indig> Pandit </indig> Ravi Shankar performs at a concert, it
becomes a festival of music, even if it is a one-evening festival.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#60:4>
In its <quote> " new heights of entertainment" </quote> series The
Hindustan Times group of publications provided that on Thursday evening, when
the maestro regaled a large audience at Kamani auditorium is hardly adequate
for an artiste of <indig> Pandit </indig> Ravi <w> Shankar's </w>
popularity which transcends all barriers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#61:4>
Long before the programme commenced, punctually at 7 p. m., the
hall was overfull, and a large crowd of Ravi Shankar fans waited outside to
get some place anywhere in hall.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#62:4>
The organisers were hard put to it to accommodate all, but
ultimately, and somehow, a place was found for most of the people.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#63:4>
On his part, responding to such an overwhelming enthusiasm of his
fans, <indig> Pandit </indig> Ravi Shankar did not disappoint them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#64:4>
Also, unlike many other artistes, he conformed to the best standards
when he announced his <indig> ragas </indig> and the <indig> taals </indig>
to which these were set.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#65:4>
To begin with, his choice of the opening number itself was most
welcome despite the fact that such a serious and difficult <indig> raga
</indig> as <indig> Shuddha Kalyan </indig> is rarely heard on the <indig>
sitar </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#66:4>
<indig> Pandit </indig> Ravi Shankar himself has rarely presented
it at Delhi concerts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#67:4>
It was, as the maestro said, one of the favourites of <}> <-> is </->
<+> his </+> </}> <indig> guru </indig> , Ustad Alauddn Khan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#68:4>
In nearly 45 minutes of <indig> alaap </indig> and <indig> jor
</indig> the <indig> <w> raga's </w> </indig> subtle beauties were most
skilfully rendered.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#69:4>
The <indig> raga </indig> has all the notes of <indig> Bhoopali
</indig> - - except <indig> madhyam </indig> and <indig> nishad </indig> - -
and yet the nauances of <indig> Shuddha Kalyan </indig> have to be rendered
in a manner which creates an aura quite different from that of <indig>
Bhoopali </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#70:4>
The soul of <indig> Shuddha Kalyan </indig> lies in the more or less
frequent but tangential use of <indig> madhyam </indig> and <indig> nishad
</indig> in the <indig> avaroha </indig> or descent; and almost implied
use which makes it a difficult task on the <indig> sitar </indig> , but one
which Ravi Shankar essayed with great ability.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#71:4>
The combinations he presented during <indig> jor </indig> were many
and varied, clear and imaginative, and with these he developed the <indig>
<w> raga's </w> </indig> form which has reposeful grandeur, best suited
for <indig> alaap </indig> and <indig> jor </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#72:4>
Thereafter, the <indig> gats </indig> , set to <indig> roopak
</indig> and <indig> drut ek-taal </indig> , were switched over to yet
another sweet member of the great <indig> Kalyan </indig> family - - <indig>
Yaman Kalyan </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#73:4>
The key note - - <indig> shuddha madhyam </indig> - - which
differentiates the <indig> raga </indig> from <indig> Yaman </indig>
itself was most appropriately, though somewhat sparingly, used, creating a
tremendous appeal.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#74:4>
The <indig> gat todas </indig> were rich in rhythm and variety,
especially in the fast piece in which he preferred the <indig> drut ek-taal
</indig> to the stereotyped <indig> teen-taal </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#75:4>
The former has a rhythmic charm of its own.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#76:4>
And it was in this <}> <-> apart </-> <+> part </+> </}> of the
concert that the listener-interest was further enhanced by the <indig> tabla
</indig> accompaniment of young maestro Shafaat Ahmed Khan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#77:4>
His <indig> theka </indig> was perfectly proportionate to the needs
of the main artiste.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#78:4>
Occasionally, there were the usual signals for a spell of solo to
which Shaffat adequately responded, drawing applause from an appreciative
audience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#79:4>
<indig> Mishra Gara </indig> , another delightful evening melody,
was presented in the post-intermission session in all its fullness through
two <indig> gats </indig> , set to <indig> teen-taal </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#80:4>
The <indig> alaap-jor </indig> sequence was rightly dispensed
with.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#81:4>
The first in slow <indig> teen-taal </indig> was played in the
<indig> thumir-ang </indig> which admitted of bringing in shades of a number
of other <indig> ragas </indig> , fitting in well through an occasional use
of <indig> moorchana </indig> or change of scale.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#82:4>
It had a very pleasing effect and the <indig> ragas </indig> that
appealed most were <indig> Pilu </indig> and bits of <indig> Pahadi, Megh and
Hamsadhwani </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#83:4>
In the fast piece one heard <indig> gatkari </indig> at its best,
which included a number of intricate <indig> tihais </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#84:4>
It was a pleasing spell of rhythm and speed but not devoid of music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#85:4>
Not even in the climaxing crescendo - - whereafter the maestro
received a standing ovation. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#87:5>
<bold> <smallcaps> INSTRUMENTAL </smallcaps> </bold> ensembles are
not new in our country.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#88:5>
There are references to <indig> Vamsaka Brinda </indig> (
Flute-led orchestra ) and other types of ensembles in many of our
ancient texts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#89:5>
It is infact the performance of solo human voice that is of a much
later origin but has since got so well established relegating the
instrumental groups to a diminutive status.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#90:5>
All India Radio has played an important role in keeping the
orchestral tradition alive.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#91:5>
Madras and Trichy stations used to give enjoyable broadcasts of
<indig> Vadya Vrinda </indig> recitals playing highly clalssical music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#92:5>
In the north, however, the <indig> Vadya Vrinda </indig> was
concentrating on sound effects on the pattern of Western symphonies,
employing Indian <indig> ragas </indig> but not classical <indig> Kritis
</indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#93:5>
It was a refreshing experience to listen to a full-fledged
National Programme of orchestral music last Saturday.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#94:5>
It was presented under a changed name <indig> Vadya Vani </indig> and
it was indeed different and superior.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#95:5>
All the items one would expect in a vocal Karnatic music concert
<indig> Varnam, Kriti, ragam, Tanam, Pallavi, Swarakalpana </indig> et al
were presented by the ensemble.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#96:5>
The composer and conductor of the <indig> Vadya Vani </indig> , Dr.
Prapancham Sita Ram, deserves accolades for this new venture which was a
grand success.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#97:5>
The broadcast gave the satisfaction of having listened to a
regular music concert by an ace musician.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#98:5>
<indig> Viriboni ( Bhairavi), Varnam </indig> glittered with an
inatelligent mixture of contrasting gaits neatly manoeurved by the
efficient participants <indig> gaja<&>unreadable</&> ( Hansadvani) </indig>
sounded a bit too fast but the <indig> swarakalpana </indig> was arresting.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#99:5>
The piece de-resistance was the <indig> ragam, Tanam, Pallavi
</indig> item.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#100:5>
The choice of instruments to do the <indig> alapana </indig> and
<indig> Tanam </indig> by turns was interesting and entertaining.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#101:5>
The <indig> pallavi </indig> was pregnant with technical
intricacies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#102:5>
<indig> Gopuchcha Yati </indig> in both the <indig> laghus </indig>
of <indig> ata tala </indig> seemed rather redundant.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#103:5>
The composer might have as well employed <indig> srotovaha Yatti
</indig> in the second <indig> laghu </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#104:5>
<indig> Trikalam </indig> , and other <indig> vinyasams </indig>
were executed flawlessly.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#105:5>
<indig> Jagadoddarana </indig> and the <indig> Tiruppugazh
</indig> were lilting.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#106:5>
It was on the whole a very welcome variety from the routine <indig>
sammelan </indig> broadcasts only a few of which were highly relishable.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#107:5>
<indig> Vadya Vani </indig> is a commendable effort worth
repeating and continuing, under the baton of able conductors like Prapaucham
Sitaram. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#108:5>
The National Programme of music in <indig> Doordarshan </indig>
last Monday was a bland show.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#109:5>
The artiste, G. S. Mani, did not strike form.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#110:5>
Inaccuracies in tone like occurrences of lower <indig> nishada
</indig> in <indig> Dhenuka ( Teliyaleru) </indig> and errors in lyric were
too many though the <w> singer's </w> mother-tongue is Telugu.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#111:5>
Even expert <}> <-> accuopanists </-> <+> accompanists </+> </}>
like V. V. Subramaniam and Sivaraman could not raise the telecast above
mediocrity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-014#112:5>
It was a reverse effect in the <indig> sammelan </indig>
broadcast on Tuesday where the singer maestro Balamuralikrishna, shone on his
own merit without depending upon the accompanists A Muralikrishna & Dorai.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#113:5>
The <indig> Hindolam </indig> composition had an overdose of
<indig> sovaraksharam </indig> , and <indig> Dandamu </indig> is <indig>
Balahamsa </indig> sounded too much like Western folk music.

<ICE-IND:W2D-014#114:5>
