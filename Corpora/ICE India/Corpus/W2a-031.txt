<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#2:1>
<bold> Rourkela, with an estimated population of 350,000, is the
most important industrial city in the mineral rich state of Orissa.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#3:1>
In addition to two large industries, namely steel and fertilisers, the
Rourkela Industrial Complex also contains many medium industries and
nearly three hundred small-scale units.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#4:1>
Thus Rourkela offers an excellent opportunity for the study of
environmental pollution and its management, and the experience gained here
may be useful in the planning of future industrial towns.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#5:1>
Keeping this in view, we have undertaken an on - - going study of the
environmental pollution in this steel city.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#6:1>
We report in this paper the results of our preliminary survey of solid
wastes and their disposal in Rourkela.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#7:1>
This survey, conducted over a period of two years ( 1987-1989 ) ,
covers domestic wastes, refuse from hospitals, markets, community centres,
etc., and industrial wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#8:1>
We discuss here the estimated quantity of solid wastes from these
sources, methods currently used for the collection and disposal of wastes,
the potential for land pollution, and future trends in the generation and
disposal of solid wastes in Rourkela. </p> </bold> <&> in two columns </&>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#10:1>
Waste has been a part of human activity since time immemorial.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#11:1>
Baking of bricks for the Great Wall of China, for example, saw the
end of forests all around, thus damaging the environment and
impoverishing that country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#12:1>
In the earlier times, however, the population was small, needs were
few, resources were abundant and the generation of waste was less.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#13:1>
Moreover, these wastes got naturally recycled, since they were mostly
biodegradable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#14:1>
During this century, however, the resources have been recklessly
used and this has given rise to the generation of very diverse types of
wastes which are often hazardous as well as non-biodegradable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#15:1>
Since the ecosystem cannot absorb them in the natural course, the
piling of such wastes poses a serious environmental problem and it may
even affect the stability of the biosphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#16:1>
During the last two decades or so, it has become clear that the
resources of the world are limited.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#17:1>
In order to maintain a stable economic growth and a reasonably high
standard of living, therefore, it is very necessary that we use the available
resources very carefully and evolve suitable technologies for the recycling
of wastes to save both resources and energy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#18:1>
For a resourceful society, nothing is really waste.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#19:1>
In fact, <w> today's </w> waste may be regarded as <w> tomorrow's
</w> raw material.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#20:1>
In some situations, however, waste can be a big health hazard and
must be disposed off properly, for example by sanitary land fill.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#21:1>
In the following sections, we examine the problem of wastes in India
and then discuss the generation and disposal of solid wastes - - both
municipal and industrial - - in Rourkela. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#22:1>
<h> <bold> WASTE IN INDIA </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#23:1>
Solid wastes may be defined as <quote > ` useless, unwanted or
discarded materials that arise from <w> man's </w> activities and are not
free-flowing' </quote> ( WHO expert Committee,1971 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#24:1>
The extraction and processing of industrial raw materials produces
far greater quantities of solid waste than come from homes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#25:1>
However, of all the materials with which an engineer has to deal,
perhaps least is known about solid wastes, even in developed countries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#26:1>
In India, a comprehensive Staatus Report on Utilisation and
Recycling of Wastes was prepared in 1975 by the National Committee on Science
and Technology of the Government of India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#27:1>
Although much effort had gone in the preparation of this report, not
much follow-up action has been taken so far on its recommendations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#28:1>
A survey of <O> <*> line from left to right</*> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#29:1>
* <footnote> <it> IDL Chemicals Limited, Quality Control Laboratory,
Rourkela </it> - 769016 </footnote> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 926 </O>
literature revealed, moreover, that very little information is available
on the extent and nature of wastes in India ( Anon, 1970; Bhide <it> et
al., </it> 1972; Vimal, 1977; Vimal and Talashilkar, 1984; Vimal and
Tyagi, 1982; Mall and Upadhyay, 1988; Jain and Sharma, 1988; Moitra and
Pandey, 1989 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#30:1>
By proper recycling and utilisation of waste materials, it is
possible to conserve the national resources, reduce the cost of production in
many cases, solve the problem of environmental pollution to some extent
and generate some employment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#31:1>
During the last decades, waste recycling and reuse has been one of
the major activities in most of the developed countries and considerable
progress has been achieved.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#32:1>
In India and other developing nations too, there is an urgent need
now for an intensive research and development effort in this area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#33:1>
Having the vast <mention> R and D </mention> infrastructure and the
third <del> - </del> largest scientific and technical manpower in the world,
India has the potential to become a world leader in this relatively new field
of waste recycling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#34:1>
Depending on their origin, the wastes may be grouped into the
following 7 categories ( Khoshoo, 1986 ) : <mention> Agricultural wastes
</mention> , <mention> Fruit and vegetable wastes </mention> , <mention>
Animal wastes</mention>, <mention> Aquatic weeds </mention> , <mention>
Community wastes </mention> , <mention> lndustrial wastes </mention> , and
<mention> Construction materials </mention> from wastes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#35:1>
Some typical examples of various types of wastes are given in table
1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#36:1>
While waste utilisation is a high technology area in developed
countries, in many cities of developing countries ( including India ) garbage
is sorted out by hand for materials such as tin, glass, paper, plastics, rags
and bones.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#37:1>
These generate new materials and also some employment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#38:1>
In fact, there has been a regular market in India for a long time for
waste paper, rags and empty glass bottles.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#39:1>
Thus the basic idea of recycling is already present in our
society; but by and large waste utilisation on a wider scale has not taken
root in our country. </p> <O> Table 1. </O> <O> caption </O>

<h> <bold> ROURKELA lNDUSTRIAL COMPEX </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#41:1>
Rourkela is a one of the important industrial towns in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#42:1>
It is situated approximately 415 km south-west of Calcutta on the
Calcutta - - Bombay railway line.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#43:1>
Tha current population of Rourkela, estimated by extrapolating the
data of 1981 census, is roughly 350,000 and its area is 121.7 km<sp>2</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#44:1>
It is situated in close proximity to iron ore, dolomite and coal
belts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#45:1>
The integrated steel plant at Rourkela ( with a rated capacity of
1.8 MT ) was constructed in the late 1950s with the assistance from the
Federal Republic of Germany.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#46:1>
In addition two heavy industries, namely steel and fertilisers,
the Rourkela Industrial Complex also contains almost 300 small-scale
units.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#47:1>
Some other large and medium industries in and around Rourkela are :
<mention> Orissa Cement Ltd., </mention> Rajgangpur; <mention> Orissa
Industries Ltd., </mention> Lathikata; <mention> Bisra Stone Ltd., </mention>
Birmitrapur; <mention> Utkal Machinery Ltd., </mention> Kansbahal; <mention>
IDL Chemicals Ltd., </mention> Rourkela; <mention> Orissa Fertilisers
</mention> and <mention> Chemicals Ltd., </mention> Kalunga; and <mention>
Blast Furnace Slag Cement Plants </mention> at Kalunga and Rajgangpur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#48:1>
Rourkela is, in fact, the most important growth centre for
ancillary industries in Orissa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#49:1>
Due to the presence of a large number of heavy, medium and
small-scale industrial units, Rourkela presents a unique opportunity for the
study of environmental pollution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#50:1>
However, the experience gained at Rourkela regarding the
management of environmental pollution may be useful in the planning of
future industrial towns in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#51:1>
In spite of such crucial importance of Rourkela from the point of
view of environmental studies, a survey of literature revealed that hardly
any work had been done to assess the extent of environmental pollution in
this idustrial city.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#52:1>
In order to remedy this situation, one <O> <&> page </&> 927 </O> of
the present authors ( Tiwari ) and his coworkers embarked on an ambitious
programme to make an exhaustive and on-going study of environmental pollution
in Rourkela ( Tiwari <it> et al., </it> 1987; Patel and Tiwari, 1989; Ali and
Tiwari, 1988; Tiwari and Ali, 1988; Tiwari and Patel, 1989; Tiwari, 1989 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#53:1>
As a part of this project, we report here the results of our
preliminary survey of the generation and disposal of solid wates in Rourkela.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#54:1>
<h> <bold> MUNICIPAL WASTES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#55:1>
The preliminary survey of municipal wastes in Rourkela
reported in this paper was conducted over a period of 2 year ( Jan., 1988 to
Dec., 1989 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#56:1>
The main results of this survey are summarised in table 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#57:1>
The total quantity of solid wastes collected during the period of
survey was estimated from the number of trips made by the garbage
collecting trucks and the approximate amount of garbage taken in each trip.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#58:1>
It was found that the municipal refuse collected during the year 1988
was roughly 33,000 tonne, while that during 1989 was approximately 29,OOO
tonne.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#59:1>
lt was observed during our survey that ragpickers are quite active in
Rourkela.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#60:1>
Even before the garbage is collected by the trucks for disposal,
the rag-pickers go through the piles of garbage and collect <mention>
empty glass bottles </mention> , <mention> broken pieces of glass </mention>
, <mention> rags </mention> , <mention> plastics </mention> , <mention>
polyethylene bags </mention> , and <mention> metallic objects </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#61:1>
<mention> The vegetable and fruit peels </mention> and <mention>
other edible wastes </mention> are eaten by roaming cows, pigs and dogs
before the garbage is collected for disposal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#62:1>
Another interesting phenomenon observed during this survey was that
the roaming cows of Rourkela eat with great relish the pieces of paper found
in the garbage or anywhere else.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#63:1>
So the quantity of collected garbage mentioned earlier does not
include the items collected by rag-pickers or eaten by roaming animals. </p>
<O> Table 2. </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#64:1>
The garbage collected by the municipal authorities may be roughly
classified into two groups, namely ( 1) <mention> infectious refuse
</mention> , and ( 2) <mention> non-infectious refuse </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#65:1>
<mention> Infectious refuse </mention> comes from hospitals,
dispensaries and markets.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#66:1>
<mention> Non-infectious refuse </mention> , on the other hand,
consists of the refuse coming from homes, streets and gardens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#67:1>
The refuse is collected from all the sectors of Rourkela ( including
labour colonies ) and Fertiliser Township, hospitals, markets, community
centres, bus garage and Trainee Hostels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#68:1>
The methods of disposal of the two types of wastes are different.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#69:1>
<mention> The infectious refuse </mention> is dumped in an old and
discarded brick kiln beyond Koel Nagar on the outskirts of Rourkela and
covered with soil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#70:1>
Dry, <mention> non-infectious refuse </mention> , on the other hand,
is dumped in the low-lying areas of the Town, with proper co-ordination
between the Land Section and Town Engineering Section of the Rourkela
Steel Plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#71:1>
Such garbage is dumped at present behind the <mention> Ispat Stadium
</mention> and adjacent areas.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#72:1>
In dry seasons, some of the garbage is burnt on roadside instead
of being collected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#73:1>
It was found that the quantity of refuse collected from July to
December is almost double the amount collected from January to June in
each year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#74:1>
This extra <mention> refuse </mention> mostly consists of garden
wastes, such as bushes and tree cuttings, during the rainy seasons and the
months following it. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#75:1>
<h> <bold> BLAST FURNACE SLAG </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#76:1>
Rourkela Steel Plant was the first integrated steel plant in
India in the public sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#77:1>
This plant caters to a varied and wide spectrum of consumers,
starting from <mention> household wares </mention> and <mention>
agricultural implements </mention> to heavy and core industries, ship
building, boilers, defence, railways, automobiles, electrical equipments, oil
transportation and chemical industries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#78:1>
The rated capacity of <mention> Rourkela Steel Plant </mention> is
1.8 MT.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#79:1>
If the plant runs at full capacity, the annual productction of blast
furnace slag would be about <O> <&> page </&> 928 </O> 700,000 tonne per
year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#80:1>
The approximate chemical composition of blast furnace slag is shown
in table 3.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#81:1>
Prior to 1977, this huge amount of blast furnace slag was dumped
as waste material.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#82:1>
It was decided, however, to install a Slag Granulation Plant to make
use of practically the entire amount of slag produced by the blast furnaces.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#83:1>
Such a plant, with an annual capacity of 600,000 tonne, was set up in
1977 at an estimated cost of Rs 3.86 <indig> crore. </indig> </p> <O> Table
3. </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#84:1>
Cement is one of the core raw materials for a developing
country like India and it plays a vital role in the economic growth of the
country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#85:1>
Granulated blast furnance slag is an excellent input material for
cement production and can replace the main ingredient - - the clinker - -
up to 50-60%.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#86:1>
The use of granulated slag for cement production results in
significant cost reduction in cement industry as well as steel industry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#87:1>
It also results in marked conservation of limestone - - a basic
raw material for both of these industries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#88:1>
A small amount of granulated slag, moreover, can also be a substitute
for lime in fertiliser industry. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-031#89:1>
Some of the important cement factories which have successfully
used the granulated slag from Rourkela on commerical scale are <mention>
Andhra Cement Ltd., </mention> Vijayawada; <mention> Rohtas Industries
</mention> , Dalmianagar and <mention> Orissa Cement Ltd., </mention>
Rajgangpur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#90:1>
Several other cement companies have also shown interest in the
granulated blast furnace slag from Rourkela.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#91:1>
Thus, instead of being a <mention> solid waste </mention>
contributing to environmental pollution, the <mention> blast furnace slag
</mention> from the <mention> Rourkela Steel Plant </mention> will result in
additional availability of over 1.2 MT of <mention> Portland Blast Furnace
Slag </mention> cement to the country every year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#92:1>
We note here that only the <mention> blast furnace slag </mention> is
utilised for granulation and subsequent cement production.

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#93:1>
The slag produced in the steel melting shop ( SMS ) contains a higher
percentage of iron and is, therefore, not useful as a raw material for
<mention> Portland cement industry </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-031#94:1>
The <mention> SMS slag </mention> is taken at present to the dumping
yard and collected later by private parties for use in mini steel plants.
