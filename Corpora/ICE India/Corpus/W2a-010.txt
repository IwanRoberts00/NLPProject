<ICE-IND:W2A-010#5:1>
<quote> ` MUSIC' </quote> in this paper refers to Indian music in
particular.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#6:1>
This word is taken here in its current meaning, covering vocal and
instrumental rendering, excluding dance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#7:1>
The affinity of music with other arts is the most conspicuous in
the case of literature, specially in the Indian tradition because of the
prime place accorded to vocal music and because of the textual component of
vocal music, which is often meaningful, though non-lexical text is not
ruled out.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#8:1>
<indig=sanskrit> <it> Nada </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( roughly tone )
is the basic material of music and <indig=sanskrit> <it> varna </it>
</indig=sanskrit> ( syllable) is that of literature and both are inseparable
in a way.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#9:1>
Hence we begin our enquiry with the affinity of music with literature.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#10:1>
Talking of training, it would be interesting to cite Mammata who
mentions training as one of the three factors that cumulatively contribute
to poetic creativity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#11:1>
<quote> " Inborn ability <indig=sanskrit> <it> ( sakti ) </it>
</indig=sanskrit> , proficiency <indig=sanskrit> <it> ( nipunata ) </it>
</indig=sanskrit> that is attained through observation of <indig=sanskrit>
<it> loka </it> </indig=sanskrit> or life and study of treatise of authority
<indig=sanskrit> <it> ( sastra ) </it> </indig=sanskrit> and practice
<indig=sanskrit> <it> ( abhyasa ) </it> </indig=sanskrit> according to
instruction received from the knowledgeable ones in literature, these
three cumulatively bring about the creation of literature." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#12:1>
All these three factors are equally applicable in musical
creativity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#13:1>
Inborn talent is the first requisite.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#14:1>
This is explained as <indig=sanskrit> <it> samskarn </it>
</indig=sanskrit> ( lit.impression ) or <indig=sanskrit> <it> vasana </it>
</indig=sanskrit> which could be explained as <quote> ` the present
consciousnss of past perceptions' </quote> ( Monier Williams ) ; this word is
derived from the root <indig=sanskrit> <it> vas </it> </indig=sanskrit>
meaning <quote> ` to perfume or scent' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#15:1>
The idea is that an impression permeates the mind as a scent
permeates an object like a piece of cloth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#16:1>
In Sanskrit idiom, <indig=sanskrit> <it> <quote> ` vasana' </quote>
</it> </indig=sanskrit> is a more basic word that is explained as
<indig=sanskrit> <it> samskara </it> </indig=sanskrit> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#17:1>
While explaining the perception of musical intervals, Kumbha
speaks of the <indig=sanskrit> <it> anadi vasana </it> </indig=sanskrit> or
beginningless impression <O> <&> page </&> 12 </O> in the listener and
performer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#18:1>
Thus, <it> inborn talent </it> that is nothing but a bundle of
impressions accumulated in previous births, according to Indian thought, is
accepted to play a vital role in musical creativity not only in performance,
but also in listening.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#19:1>
This could be said to be true of all the arts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#20:1>
In the attainment of proficiency, the observation of
<indig=sanskrit> <it> loka </it> </indig=sanskrit> i.e. the behaviour of
static and dynamic beings <indig=sanskrit> <it> ( sthavarajangama ) </it>
</indig=sanskrit> and the study of treatises of authority <indig=sanskrit>
<it> ( sastra ) </it> </indig=sanskrit> is said to be essential.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#21:1>
While <indig=sanskrit> <it> loka </it> </indig=sanskrit> , which in
a wider view, could be said to include all aspects of life, inner and outer,
is basic to any art, whether it is drama, music, literature, painting,
sculpture or architecture, its presentation is direct in some arts and
indirect in others.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#22:1>
Music falls in the latter category.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#23:1>
<indig=sanskrit> <it> Natyasastra </it> </indig=sanskrit> speaks of
<indig=sanskrit> <it> loka-vrtta </it> </indig=sanskrit> , as the object of
depiction and it has been said to be comprised of <indig=sanskrit> <it>
karman </it> </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> bhava </it>
</indig=sanskrit> that could be roughly translated as action and mental state
or the <quote> ` outer' </quote> and <quote> ` inner' </quote> of life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#24:1>
Mammata has enumerated the following disciplines that are
prescribed for study by an aspirant of creativity in literature - - <quote> "
<indig=sanskrit> <it> chandas </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( prosody ) ,
<indig=sanskrit> <it> vyakarana </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( grammar),
<indig=sanskrit> <it> abhidhana </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( vocabulary ) ,
<indig=sanskrit> <it> kosa </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( lexicon),
<indig=sanskrit> <it> kala </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( arts ) , the four
<indig=sanskrit> <it> purusarthas </it> </indig=sanskrit> ( viz.,
<indig=sanskrit> <it> dharma, artha, kama, moksa </it> </indig=sanskrit> )
and the characteristics of elephants horses and weapons like swords."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#25:1>
It is interesting to compare the requisites of a musical composer
<indig=sanskrit> <it> ( vaggeyakara ) </it> </indig=sanskrit> outlined in
<indig=sanskrit> <it> Sangita-Ratnakara </it> </indig=sanskrit> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#26:1>

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#27:1>
An analysis of the aove requisites reveals that since the musical
composer is required to compose the text of the song along with its melodic
and rhythmic structure, his qualifications include those of the poet, the
musician and general qualities of the mind like attention, freedom from like,
dislike etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#28:1>
We have to note here that prime position is given to vocal music in
the Indian tradition, on account of which the concept of a composer happens
to be what is described above. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#29:1>
The third factor contributing to poetic creativity enumerated by
Mammata is <indig=sanskrit> <it> abhyasa </it> </indig=sanskrit> or practice
based on training under knowledgeable ones in literature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#30:1>
In music, <indig=sanskrit> <it> abhyasa </it> </indig=sanskrit>
plays an extremely vital role.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#31:1>
Bhartrhari has expounded <indig=sanskrit> <it> abhyasa </it>
</indig=sanskrit> as a <indig=sanskrit> <it> pramana </it> </indig=sanskrit>
or means of valid knowledge in the perception of musical notes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#32:1>
It is by repetitive listening that proficiency in the perception of
<indig=sanskrit> <it> svaras </it> </indig=sanskrit> is acquired.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#33:1>
Similarly, <indig=sanskrit> <it> <quote> ` kriya' </quote> </it>
</indig=sanskrit> , another name for <indig=sanskrit> <it> abhyasa </it>
</indig=sanskrit> or practice is a basic requisite of a performer of music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#34:1>
All arts require practice, but for performing arts including music,
it is indispensable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#35:1>
Today the element of training has almost vanished from literature.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#36:1>
Having dealt with the similarity between the reqisites of
creativity in literature and music, we could turn attention to the special
features that distinguish music as a performing art from other arts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#37:1>
In a performing art, there is no finished product as such, creativity
is concurrent with performance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#38:1>
This is not the case with literature and visual arts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#39:1>
In Indian music, the three functions of creativity, viz.,
imagination, execution and evaluation are discharged simultaneously.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#40:1>
Since pre-composed or pre-determined material forms a very small
percentage of the material presented in art-music, imagination is also
brought into play by the performer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#41:1>
He makes the mental images of tonal formations, renders them with
voice or on instruments and constantly evaluates whether or not his execution
is upto the mark with reference to the image concerned.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#42:1>
Of course, it should be noted that imagination in Indian music
operates in the given framework of the <indig=sanskrit> <it> raga, tala
</it> </indig=sanskrit> and type of composition taken up for performance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#43:1>
This framework <O> <&> page </&> 14 </O> is handed down by tradition
and is transmitted through training.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#44:1>
No other art has such a strong framework excepting, perhaps, temple
architecture.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#45:1>
Tradition here does not mean something static or rigid; it is a
continuous flow of creativity that finds room within a given framework. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#46:1>
The above three functions are performed at three different stages
by different persons in Western music, drama and architecture.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#47:1>
In Western music, the composer is responsible for imagination, the
performer for execution and the conductor for evaluation or interpretation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#48:1>
In drama, the poet imagines, the actor executes and the director
evaluates or interprets.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#49:1>
In architecture, the architect is the one who imagines, a team of
workers and artisans execute and the engineer or overseer evaluates and
interprets.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#50:1>
The crux of creativity lies in imagination and hence the composer,
poet and architect enjoy an exalted position. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#51:1>
With regard to the creative process again, Indian music is unique
because the corpus of the framework handed down by tradition is built up
constantly by unidentified musicians.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#52:1>
Two streams in musical creativity have been recognised - - one is
referential and the other is non-referential or autonomous.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#53:1>
<mention> NS </mention> gives them the names <indig=sanskrit> <it>
gana </it> </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> gandharva </it>
</indig=sanskrit> respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#54:1>
Abhinavagupta has elaborately elucidated the distinction between
the two.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#55:1>
In <mention> NS </mention> , the point of reference in the case of
referential music is naturally drama.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#56:1>
Even otherwise, the referential component of any music is nothing
but a situation from life which includes both animate and inanimate beings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#57:1>
A situation itself is a drama in miniature form.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#58:1>
When one creates music for drama or for a given situation, the
creativity springs from the <w> composer's </w> identification with the
given situation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#59:1>
This identification again as different from the common <w> man's
</w> identification with a situation in actual life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#60:1>
The above point has been beautifully explained by
Abhinavagupta in his commentary on <indig=sanskrit> <it> Dhvanyaloka
</it> </indig=sanskrit> , 1.5, where he discusses the identification of
Valmiki with the pathetic situation of one <indig=sanskrit> <it> kraunca
</it> </indig=sanskrit> bird out of the pair that was involved in
lovemaking.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#61:1>
He says that Valmiki was not afflicted with grief, because if that
were so, the moment of poetic creativity would not have dawned upon him.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#62:1>
Creativity is not possible in a moment of personal sorrow or joy, nor
in a moment of identification <O> <&> page </&> 15 </O> with a
situation from life that lands in affliction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#63:1>
The element of distance is very essential in addition to
identification for reaching a state congenial to artistic creativity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#64:1>
This is a moment of <quote> ` release' </quote> from the <quote> `
bondage' </quote> of day-to-day life which functions in the triangle of
time-space, individual; here one comes face to face with the Universal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#65:1>
This is allright so far as it goes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#66:1>
But music has another dimension, also where a situation from life is
not relevant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#67:1>
This dimension is referred to as the autonomy of music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#68:1>
In traditional Indian thought, Abhinavagupta has spoken of this
autonomy in unequivocal terms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#69:1>
He say that <indig=sanskrit> <it> svara </it> </indig=sanskrit>
<quote> ` heats' </quote> the mind on account of its beauty and makes the
latter relinquish its normal state and then the <indig=sanskrit> <it> svara
</it> </indig=sanskrit> <quote> ` throws' </quote> itself into the mind.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#70:1>
It is notable that the <indig=sanskrit> <it> svara </it>
</indig=sanskrit> is not said to transmit any meaning or reference in the
mind; it transmits itself.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#71:1>
This is the autonomy of music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#72:1>
Moreover, music is not representational, because it has no direct
model in nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#73:1>
The sounds are there in nature, their structuring is done only by the
human being.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#74:1>
This again explains the importance of training. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#75:1>
In Western thought, <quote> ` absolute music' </quote> and
<quote> ` programme music' </quote> are used for <quote> ` music that is free
from extra-musical implications' </quote> and <quote> ` music inspired by a
non-musical idea' </quote> , respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#76:1>
In Indian thought, <indig=sanskrit> <it> gandharva </it>
</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> gana </it> </indig=sanskrit> are
the two words that were used for non-referential and referential music
respectively and drama was considered to be the source of referential music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#77:1>
Music, independent of drama, developed its own corpus of <quote> `
reference' </quote> by way of association of <indig=sanskrit> <it> ragas
</it> </indig=sanskrit> with the cycle of day and night, the six seasons and
masculinity-femininity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#78:1>
Hangovers of this association are still surviving in art-music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#79:1>
The system of <indig=sanskrit> <it> raga-dhyana </it>
</indig=sanskrit> that dominated the scene for more than five centuries is
also surviving in very lean hangovers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#80:1>
<indig=sanskrit> <it> Raga-dhyanas </it> </indig=sanskrit> provided
miniature situations for music independent of drama and also acted as a
bridge between the performer and the listener so far as the emotive content
of music was concerned.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#81:1>
All this points to the fact that no water-tight compartment was
conceived between referential and nonreferential music.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#82:1>
Even <indig=sanskrit> <it> gandharva </it> </indig=sanskrit> uses
texts eulogizing the gods and goddesses and in them also situations bearing
analogy to life are not ruled out.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#83:1>
This music is closely related to ritualistic contexts like the
rituals forming part of the <indig=sanskrit> <it> purvaranga </it>
</indig=sanskrit> of preliminaries <O> <&> page </&> 16 </O> of drama.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#84:1>
We are not discussing Vedic music here.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#85:1>
The basic idea seems to be that the source of creativity could be
two-fold - - one that does not serve the purpose of heightening or
underlining the depiction of a situation from life and the other that springs
from the need of doing so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#86:1>
<indig=sanskrit> <it> Raga </it> </indig=sanskrit> - - music is
even now being used in these two streams.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#87:1>
The <indig=sanskrit> <it> alapa </it> </indig=sanskrit> of a
<indig=sanskrit> <it> raga </it> </indig=sanskrit> could be said to be
non-referential, in spite of the associations of some <indig=sanskrit> <it>
ragas </it> </indig=sanskrit> surviving through hangovers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#88:1>
A vocal composition with meaningful text could bring in some
references, but they are soon transcended in a performance because the
maximum attention is drawn towards <indig=sanskrit> <it> raga </it>
</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> tala </it> </indig=sanskrit> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#89:1>
This is the case in <indig=sanskrit> <it> dhrupad </it>
</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> khyal </it> </indig=sanskrit>
but in <indig=sanskrit> <it> thumri </it> </indig=sanskrit> , the situation
presented by the text receives the maximum attention and <indig=sanskrit>
<it> raga </it> </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit> <it> tala </it>
</indig=sanskrit> are subservient to it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#90:1>
Hence, it is a question of predominance of one over the other and
not one of absolute categories. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#91:1>
In view of the above discussion, it could be said that
creatvity in Indian art-music is either <indig=sanskrit> <it>
raga-centred </it> </indig=sanskrit> or situation-centred where
<indig=sanskrit> <it> raga </it> </indig=sanskrit> is made subservient to a
situation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#92:1>
We have discussed to some extent the proecss of situation-centred
creativity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#93:1>
When this centre is not in operation, the whole corpus of
<indig=sanskrit> <it> raga </it> </indig=sanskrit> handed down by tradition
and nurtured in the <w> musician's </w> own consciousness becomes the spring
of creativity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#94:1>
No other art has been endowed with such a rich corpus for creativity
within a frame.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#95:1>
Only temple architecture could be said to be an exception here.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#96:1>
The freshness of creativity remains intact in spite of the
indispensability of existing frame-work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-010#97:1>
Although we have said above that the presence or absence of
extra-musical references is not accepted as an absolute or exclusive
category, it cannot but be affirmed that music does offer full scope for
eliminating external references.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#98:1>
Here again a note of caution is relevant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#99:1>
Elimination of external reference only means that such a reference is
not projected or presented.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#100:1>
All the same, it is to be remembered that the coming into being of a
reference in the mind of the performer/composer or listener cannot be ruled
out and is not an object of disdain.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#101:1>
Music is not something isolated from life and in spite of its strong
potential for non-referential use, it cannot be expected to be absolutely
free of referential association.

<ICE-IND:W2A-010#102:1>
Indian thought. <O> <&> page </&> 17 </O> has, therefore, not
formulated exclusive categories like absolute music and programme music. </p>
</I>
