<ICE-IND:W2C-018#5:1>
Yet another corporate war has moved on to the front page. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#6:1>
The target: <w> India's </w> finest and most diversified
engineering company, Larsen & Toubro.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#7:1>
With a turnover of Rs 1100 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#8:1>
And assets estimated at Rs 800 <indig> crores </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#9:1>
Its first wooers - - the Chhabrias - - lost out to the Ambanis,
who acquired the cash-rich company, allegedly with the support of the Rajiv
government.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#10:1>
Aided and abetted by the financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#11:1>
That is what claims the Indian Express - - and its favourite
columnist, S Gurumurthy, who has tormented the Ambanis for three long years
now.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#12:1>
On behalf of their business rival, the immaculate Nusli Wadia of
Bombay Dyeing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#13:1>
Now, with the fall of Rajiv, the Chhabrias have sworn to avenge
their defeat.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#14:1>
They have joined hands with Gurumurthy to try and persuade the new
government to intervene in the battle over Larsen & Toubro.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#15:1>
To reverse the takeover. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#16:1>
Will V P Singh oblige? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#17:1>
Will cabinet secretary Vinod Pande, asked by Singh to look into
the matter, act at the behest of Gurumurthy?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#18:1>
Or will he keep a safe distance from the corporate war, having burnt
his fingers once - - during the Ambani versus Wadia war which led to the
infamous Fairfax scandal? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#19:1>
What role will new finance secretary Bimal Jalan play?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#20:1>
What is the opinion of Soli Sorabjee, attorney general?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#21:1>
Most crucial, of course, will be the decision of the Supreme Court
which is currently seized of the issue.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#22:1>
On an appeal against the Bombay high court, which cleared the
takeover. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#23:1>
Whatever happens, it seems certain the Gurumurthy-Chhabria
combine will try to force the new government to intervene.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#24:1>
But can they prise the company out of the hands of the Ambanis?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#25:1>
Unlikely, say the experts.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#26:1>
If the Ambanis lose Larsen & Toubro, by the same argument, the
Chhabrias themselves could lose Dunlop and Shaw Wallace, Dorr Oliver and
Mather & Platt.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#27:1>
At least two of them were equally controversial acquisitions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#28:1>
What would then happen to R P <w> Goenka's </w> takeovers?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#29:1>
Or Vijay <w> Mallya's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#30:1>
Or the many others that have taken place during the Rajiv regime?

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#31:1>
What would be the fall-out of such a decision? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#32:1>
Sailesh Kottary profiles the new corporate war threatening to
grab the headlines. </p> <O> logo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#33:1>
For Dhirubhai Ambani and for several others close to the Rajiv
government, the gauntlet was thrown even before the new administration of
V P Singh took its oath of office.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#34:1>
The chairman of the Reliance group, that pace-setting business house
which had rapidly diversified during the <w> ' 80s </w> from a textile
company to a petrochemical, cement and engineering colossus, had been
perceived as the most favoured industrialist during the Rajiv years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#35:1>
And during the Indira Gandhi years as well.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#36:1>
So it was obvious that he would not exactly be in favour with the new
bosses in New Delhi, who until last month were in the Opposition. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#37:1>
True, Ambani, who shaped the destinies of Reliance from his
fourth floor chambers which occupy half a floor of the highrise Maker
Chambers IV in <w> Bombay's </w> pricy Nariman Point district was not alone
in feeling a sense of siege by the impending machinations of the changed
order.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#38:1>
It was a miasma which hung over several extra-constitutional centres
of power of New <w> Delhi's </w> age of Gucci and Cartier that had just been
voted out of office: Captain Satish Sharma, Lalit Suri, Amitabh Bachchan
amongst others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#39:1>
The abrasive Captain Sharma whose career flight path had been
closely linked with that of Rajiv had hardly endeared himself to anyone
during the heady days of power.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#40:1>
Those were the days when the high and mighty across the land came to
his office to receive their <foreign> diktat </foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#41:1>
One such visitor was industrialist Vijayapat Singhania, who was
made to cool his heels for a very long time until they were virtually frozen
in the <w> captain's </w> ante-room, despite a confirmed appointment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#42:1>
For his efforts, Singhania was told that his newspaper, <it> The
Indian Post </it> , was a <quote> 'rag' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#43:1>
And that it was an inconvenient one too.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#44:1>
Lalit Suri was more low-profile, but the <foreign> entrepreneur
</foreign> had managed to establish several businesses and owned a massive
5-star hotel in the capital during the construction of which more rules were
broken than the hotel had rooms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#45:1>
Amitabh Bachchan was perhaps the one with the most acute
symptoms of the siege complex.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#46:1>
It was largely due to his <w> relatives' </w> blatant enormity and
vaulting ambitions - - coupled with his own status as a megastar - - that the
Bachchan had come to represent the most visible face of cronyism that
flourished under Rajiv Gandhi.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#47:1>
Brother <w> Ajitabh's </w> possession of a flat in Switzerland saw
perhaps the most scandalous cover-up on the part of the Gandhi
administration, next only to the Bofors affair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#48:1>
Cousin Abhijit <w> Rajan's </w> hand in the Gammon India takeover
controversy saw the Bachchans scripting an indeterminate role as
industrialists for themselves - - with a little help from the financial
institutions, of course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#49:1>
The <w> administration's </w> action, though seemingly
unconnected, was not long in coming Captain Sharma, however, has been the
only victim of a frontal attack when his house was raided and he scurried to
legal experts to seek advice on the possibility of obtaining
anticipatory bail.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#50:1>
The Bachchan file has been reopened and last week the star gave a
detailed interview to a periodical from <it> The Times of India </it> group
of publications in which he lashed out at the attempts being made by the
administration to harass, hound and humiliate him and his family.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#51:1>
So by last week, if it was clear that it was not to be a case of only
Vimal with V P Singh, it was equally clear that Ambani would nonetheless be
chosen for special attention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#52:1>
The omens of such a fate for the third largest business house
with a turnover exceeding Rs 2,300 <indig> crores </indig> were visible in
the first executive actions of the new prime minister.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#53:1>
Vinod Pande, the former all-powerful revenue secretary who had led
the crackdown against erring industrialists with his chief bloodhound,
Bhure Lal, then head of the Directorate of Enforcement, were both called back
from the boondocks.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#54:1>
The former was made the cabinet secretary and the latter inducted
into the prime <w> minister's </w> office as joint secretary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#55:1>
Bhure Lal in particular had a special reason to dislike
Ambani.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#56:1>
He had got the boot three years ago while on the trail of the shell
companies in the Caribbean which had invested Rs 22 <indig> crores
</indig> in <w> Ambani's </w> Reliance industries.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#57:1>
While rumour had it that Ambani owned the clutch of shell companies
with such fanciful names as Crocodile Investments, Fiasco Investments etc,
it was also speculated that the powers that be were purposely misled into
believing that Bhure Lal was actually investigating the hoard of
Amitabh Bachchan while overtly tracking the Ambanis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#58:1>
Whatever the truth, the fact is that V P Singh was soon shunted
from the finance portfolio and Vinod Pande and Bhure Lal were relegated to
minor roles once the seeds of suspicion had been firmly planted.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#59:1>
And what was harvested was the Michael Hershman affair and the
resultant Thakkar-Natarajan Commission which tried to ascertain the nature of
Bhure <w> Lal's </w> endeavours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#60:1>
The third key player to be recalled in the game plan now
unfolding was Bimal Jalan, an Ambani antagonist, from the post of executive
director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington who was inducted as
finance secretary.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#61:1>
In a curious switch of jobs, Gopi Arora, an alleged Ambani
sympathiser, was sent to the IMF, to stay far from the scene of action and
not to be able to influence events, as it were.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#62:1>
Interestingly, all three senior bureaucrats, Bimal Jalan, Vinod Pande
and Bhure Lal, refused to comment on their current endeavours to the <it>
Weekly </it> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#63:1>
There have been at least three other happenings which convince
<w> Reliance's </w> A-team that the group will be in for some form of
inquisition in the coming weeks if not months.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#64:1>
First, there was the transfer of K Vishwanathan, the collector of
customs, Bombay, who had quashed a case against the <w> group's </w> company,
Reliance Industries as he felt there was not enough evidence.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#65:1>
The charge was of the firm having imported extra spinning units
for its synthetic yarn mills, a charge which entails a fine totalling
Rs 120 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#66:1>
Secondly, that case now stands reopened as of December 30, 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#67:1>
And, finally, there was the sacking of Premjit Singh, chairman of BoB
Fiscal Services, even though he had just a few months of his tenure left.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#68:1>
BoB Fiscal Services was a subsidiary of the Bank of Baroda and had
played a key role in the Ambani takeover of Larsen & Toubro. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#69:1>
The customs case against Reliance Industries is only a warning
shot across <w> Ambani's </w> bow and he knows it.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#70:1>
One hundred and twenty <indig> crores </indig> of rupees can hardly
trip a juggernaut that earns profits of Rs 260 <indig> crores </indig>
annually.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#71:1>
But he also knows that the <w> administration's </w> plans for
retribution of sorts may include the breakup of his empire by prising
out his prized acquisition, Larsen & Toubro.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#72:1>
And ironically, that could perhaps be achieved in just the way the
Ambanis acquired it, according to their detractors.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#73:1>
By using the leverage of the government-owned financial
institutions such as the Unit Trust of India, the General Insurance
Corporations and Life Insurance Corporations, all of whom own a sizeable
stake in the company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#74:1>
If that could come about, it will slash the Ambani empire by
half.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#75:1>
But more frightening would be the grim consequences of government
action on industry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#76:1>
Such an interference will certainly be opening a <w> Pandora's
</w> box which was only once earlier opened in 1983 when the financial
institutions sacked nine directors of Escorts in a bid to help Swraj Paul
wrest control from H P Nanda.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#77:1>
Nanda fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court and the
financial institutions got a severe rap on the knuckles. </p> <O> logo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#78:1>
By any standards, and for anyone, Larsen & Toubro is certainly a
blue chip acquisition.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#79:1>
Founded in 1946 by two enterprising Danish engineers, Henning
Holck-Larsen and Soren Toubro, the company has established a formidable
reputation in fields of manufacture as diverse as dairy machinery, heat
exchangers and shielding for nuclear reactors.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#80:1>
It has also diversified successfully into cement manufacture and
civil construction.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#81:1>
With Holck-Larsen retiring in 1978, the reins of corporate power
passed on to his protege, N M Desai. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#82:1>
In these days of takeover tycoons, L & T was a prime target since
it had a small equity base of Rs 56 <indig> crores </indig> , the financial
institutions held 40 per cent of the equity and particularly since no one
controlled more than 0.4 per cent of the stock.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#83:1>
Besides, it was a profitable acquisition.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#84:1>
In 1987, it had earned a net profit after tax of Rs 28 <indig> crores
</indig> on sales of Rs 528 <indig> crores </indig> and its strength was in
its team of professional engineers of diverse disciplines, the finest
anywhere in the land. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#85:1>
The predatory moves began in mid-1987 when non-resident
industrialist Manu Chhabria, fresh from his successful but much delayed
acquisition of Shaw Wallace began buying L & T shares - - a spree which he
stopped once he had purchased about 1.5 per cent of stock.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#86:1>
With the financial institutions controlling under a half of the
<w> company's </w> equity, obviously any corporate raider could only be
successful in his attempts to gain management control if the
institutions were in his favour.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#87:1>
But by end-1987, the green light was not showing for Chhabria, even
though he presumably must have been assured of support from New Delhi
before deciding to invest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#88:1>
Around this time, L & T was a house divided with its senior
management team riven with discord.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#89:1>
Several senior executives had left the company due to serious
differences with Desai.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#90:1>
And matters came to a head with the exit of U V Rao, vice-president
of the <w> company's </w> most profitable division, the switchgear and
electronics group.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#91:1>
Rao quit because it was increasingly becoming clear to him that even
though he was senior, the candidate being groomed by Desai for the job of
president was S R Subramaniam, vice-president in charge of excavators,
shipping and personnel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-018#92:1>
Indeed, the appointment of Subramaniam as president effective
last April was a benchmark in the <w> company's </w> history as two other
vice-presidents, apart from Rao, had been superseded.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#93:1>
And according to his detractors, Desai was now packing his
vice-presidential team with loyalists.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#94:1>
Further, the financial institutions too were more than a bit
concerned as Desai had not given a thought to succession planning even though
his term was to expire within a few months, in March 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2C-018#95:1>
The unstated feeling was that Desai was scheming to wield power even
after retirement as he would become the <foreign> <it> eminence grise </it>
</foreign> while his loyalists squabbled among themselves. </p> </I>
