<bold> ABSTRACT </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#4:1>
Using transillumination technique, spatiotemporal patterns of
glottal dynamics were investigated during voiced/unvoiced and
aspirated/unaspirated Hindi stops which were produced in isolated nonsense
words of the form <mention> CVCVC </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#5:1>
Results show that spatial extent as well as timing of glottal gesture
in relation to certain supraglottal articulatory events, such as the
articulatory contact and articulatory release, differ in different types of
stops.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#6:1>
The present paper discusses the role of these differences along with
certain glottal and extraglottal mechanisms in control of voicing and
aspiration in Hindi stops. </p> <&> centered </&>

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#8:1>
How voicing and aspiration associated with certain speech sounds
are controlled has been a subject of considerable interest for over two and a
half millennia.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#9:1>
It appears from the phonetic observations of ancient Indian
phoneticians and grammarians that they recognized the larynx, to be specific
the glottis, as the source of phonation, i.e., voice, breathy voice,
aspiration, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#10:1>
They observed that when the glottis was open, breath was produced;
when it was closed, voice was produced; and when it was half-open, both
breath and voice were produced.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#11:1>
Further, breath was discharged for unvoiced consonants; voice was
discharged for voiced consonants and vowels; and both breath and voice were
discharged for voiced aspirates and voiced glottal fricative.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#12:1>
Also, more breath was discharged for aspirates than inaspirates. (
See Allen 1953 for further details.) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#13:1>
These above observations clearly indicate that voicing and
aspiration are essentially glottoaerodynamic phenomena in that they are
generated at the glottis if the glottis is suitably adjusted and adequate
transglottal airflow is present.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#14:1>
Transglottal airflow during speech sounds is jointly controlled by
the dynamic adjustments of the glottis and the supraglottal articulatory
structures, such as, the lips, the tongue, the soft palate, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#15:1>
For generating adequate transglottal airflow to produce voicing
and/or aspiration associated with various categories of stop consonants, the
adjustments of the glottis and the articulators must be spatiotemporally
coordinated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#16:1>
That is, when and how far the glottis should be allowed to open and
when should it <O> <&> right justification </&>

adducted position in relation to certain articulatory events, such as,
articulatory contact and articulatory release. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#18:1>
Until recently, observation of glottal adjustments has, however,
been mostly speculative and inferential, based primarily on kinesthetic
introspection of the observers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#19:1>
Only in the last two and a half decades or so, attention has been
directed toward collection of instrumental data on speech related glottal
adjustments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#20:1>
This came about with the introduction of cinefluorographic,
photo-electric glottographic, fiberscopic, and transillumination techniques
in speech research.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#21:1>
Using these techniques considerable instrumental data have been
acquired and reported on glottal adjustments associated particularly with the
production of different categories of homorganic stop consonants from a
number of two-category ( Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, English, French,
Icelandic, Japanese, Mandarin, and Swedish ) , three-category ( Fukienese,
Korean, and Tibetan ) , and four-category ( Hindi and Maithili ) languages.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#22:1>
Previously, we had reported glottographic data only on bilabial
stops and glottal fricative of Hindi ( Dixit and MacNeilage 1974; Dixit
1989).

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#23:1>
This study provides glottographic data, obtained by transillumination
technique, on all stops of Hindi.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#24:1>
One purpose of this study is to examine spatiotemporal relationship
between dynamic adjustments of the glottis and certain articulatory events,
such as articulatory contact and articulatory release, in stop consonant
production in light of the data reported in this study and the studies on the
cited languages.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#25:1>
Another purpose is to discuss general mechanisms used in the control
of voicing/devoicing and aspiration associated with various homorganic stop
consonants. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#26:1>
<bold> METHOD </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#27:1>
A normal native speaker of standard Hindi from Nagla Bariar in
Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh served as subject.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#28:1>
He produced disyllabic nonsense test words of the form <mention>
CVCVC </mention> in isolation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#29:1>
In these words V was the high front unrounded vowel / i/ and
<mention> C </mention> was one of the following stop consonants: </p> <O>
Table </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#30:1>
All <mention> C </mention> positions in an individual word were
occupied by the same stop.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#31:1>
The vowel in the second syllable was stressed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#32:1>
All unvoiced stops were produced without glottal pulsing ( except for
a few initial glottal pulses in postvocalic stops), all voiced stops were
produced with glottal pulsing throughout their entire duration, <O> <&> page,
right justification </&> 3 </O> and all word-final stops were released. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#33:1>
During the production of the test words, the glottis of the
subject was filmed at a film speed of 60 frames per second using a 16 mm
cinecamera ( Olympus MC-R58 ) and a flexible fiberscope ( Olympus VF-0 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#34:1>
The fiberscope was inserted through the nose and held in position by
a headband just behind the tip of the epiglottis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#35:1>
The light from the fiberscope passing through the glottis was also
sensed by a phototransistor attached to the skin of the neck just below the
arch of the cricoid cartilage.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#36:1>
It was held in that position by a neckband.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#37:1>
The audio signal was picked up by an oral microphone.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#38:1>
Simultaneously with fiberscopic filming of the glottis, the
transillumination and audio signals together with synchronization time marks
were recorded on a magnetic tape.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#39:1>
The transillumination and audio signals and synchronization time
marks were later reproduced on paper for visual inspection using a visicorder
oscillograph ( Honeywell 1508 A ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#40:1>
A caveat seems in order here: None of the above two methods of
glottal observation, i.e., fiberscopic filming and transillumination, can be
calibrated at present, hence it would be imprudent to suppose that there is
one-to-one correspondence between the size ( extent) of the glottograms and
the actual size of glottal opening.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#41:1>
The size of the glottograms may be enhanced or diminished by the
movement of the tongue, the epiglottis and the larynx.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#42:1>
For example, if the tongue and/or the epiglottis move backward, or
the larynx moves downward, then the size of the glottograms would be
diminished.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#43:1>
Thus, the glottograms, generally, do not represent the actual size of
glottal opening; nevertheless, they are quite useful in comparing the
relative size of glottal opening for different categories of stops and other
consonants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#44:1>
However, the glottograms reveal the temporal course of glottal
dynamics ( i.e., opening-closing gesture of the glottis) with respect to
certain articulatory events, such as articulatory contact and articulatory
release, quite realistically.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#45:1>
Since the temporal patterns of glottal opening and closing gestures
obtained by fiberscopic filming and transillumination technique were
virtually identical, therefore, only transillumination data are presented and
discussed in this paper. </p> <&> centered </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#46:1>
<h> <bold> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#47:1>
The transillumination data on Hindi stops are presented in Figure
1 through 4.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#48:1>
Each of the four figures consists of four graphs, each of which
contains two oscillographic traces.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#49:1>
The top trace ( GA ) represents the area of glottal opening, the
bottom trace ( AE ) the audio envelope.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#50:1>
The GA trace at its lowest level indicates no light passing through
the glottis ( i.e., an adducted or closed glottis ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#51:1>
Upward deviation from its lowest level indicates light passing
through the glottis ( that is, an abducted or open glottis ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#52:1>
Solid and broken vertical lines in the graphs mark the instants of
articulatory contact and articulatory release, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#53:1>
Since the test words were produced in isolation, the instants of
articulatory contact for various <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O> word-initial stops
cannot be determined by the GA and AE curves; hence, they have been left
unmarked in the graphs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#54:1>
A few instants of articulatory release were undisernible; they have
been left unmarked in the graphs, too.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#55:1>
The zero under the first solid line marks the line-up point. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#59:1>
In this figure, in the words / pipip/, / titit/ and / titit/ <*>
dot blow the three <mention> ts </mention> </*> , the glottis begins to close
rapidly from a respiratory open position and reaches a closed position
immediately after the articulatory release of the initial stops.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#60:1>
However, in the word / kikik/, the glottis shows an opening-closing
gesture for the initial stop, which is similar to that generally observed for
the medial ( intervocalic ) stops.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#61:1>
Clearly, all the initial stops in these words were produced with an
open glottis, through the degree of glottal opening varied from one stop to
another.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#62:1>
These results are similar to those reported in the other Hindi
studies ( Dixit and MacNeilage 1974; Dixit 1975; Kagaya and Hirose 1975;
Benguerel and Bhatia 1980; Dixit 1989 ) and the studies on Dutch ( Yoshioka
et al. 1982 ) , French ( Benguerel et al. 1978 ) , Japanese ( Sawashima 1968
a, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973; Sawashima and Niimi 1974; Niimi and
Sawashima 1974; Sawashima et al. 1975 ) , Korean ( Kim 1967, 1970; Kagaya
1971, 1974; Hirose et al. 1974) and Maithili ( Yadav 1984 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#63:1>
The initial unvoiced unaspirated stops in all the above studies, like
the present study, were produced with an open and non-vibrating glottis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#64:1>
However, the spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics differed in
these studies depending on whether the unvoiced unaspirated stops occurred in
the absolute or non-absolute initial position in the test words and/or test
sentences.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#65:1>
On the other hand, in Cantonese ( Iwata et al. 1981 ) , Fukienese (
Iwata et al. 1979 ) , Mandarin ( Iwata and Hirose 1976 ) and Tibetan (
Kjellin 1977 ) , the syllable- or word-initial unvoiced unaspirated stops
were produced with a virtually closed glottis, but without glottal pulsing.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#66:1>
For the medial ( intervocalic ) unvoiced unaspirated stop in the
word / pipip/, the glottis is completely closed; in the word / titit/, it is
virtually closed; and in the word / titit/ <*> dots below the three ts in the
word </*> , it is only slightly open.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#67:1>
Only in the word / kikik/, the glottis shows a clear opening-closing
gesture for the medial stop, which begins at the articulatory contact and
terminates somewhat after the articulatory release, but the size of glottal
opening is very small.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#68:1>
Except for the datum on medial / k/, the data on other medial
unvoiced unaspirated stops, examined in this study, are inconsistent with
those reported by Kagaya and Hirose ( 1975 ) and Benguerel and Bhatia ( 1980 )
<O> <&> page </&> 6 </O> from Hindi.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#69:1>
They are also inconsistent with the data reported from Dutch ( Slis
and Damste 1967 ) , English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima et al. 1970 )
, French ( Benguerel et.al. 1978 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#70:1>
Japanese ( Sawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973;
Sawashima and Niimi 1974; Niimi and Sawashima 1974 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984 )
and Swedish ( Lindqvist 1972 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#71:1>
The medial unvoiced unaspirated stops in the above studies were
generally produced with an open and silent glottis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#72:1>
The size of glottal opening varied from language to language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#73:1>
However, there were a number of occurrences of these stops in Dutch (
Slis and Damste 1967 ) , English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970 )
, and Japanese ( Sawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973 ) where the
glottis was found to be closed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#74:1>
Moreover, a few occurrences of these stops in English showed no
cessation of glottal pulsing ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970 ) .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#75:1>
The spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics for the final
unvoiced unaspirated stops in the words / pipip/, / titit/ <*> three dots
below each of the ts </*> and / kikik/ show some semblance to the
opening-closing gesture of the glottis with only a slight glottal opening.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#76:1>
On the other hand, for the final stop in the word / titit/, the
glottis starts opening at the articlatory contact and continues to open
towards a respiratory open position.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#77:1>
Apart from the datum on the final / t/ in the word / titit/, the data
on the other final unvoiced unaspirated stops of this study do not compare
well with the data reported on similar stops from another Hindi study (
Benguerel and Bhatia 1980 ) , and from English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970;
Sawashima 1970; Sawashima et al. 1970 ) , Korean ( Sawashima and Park 1979;
Sawashima et al. 1980 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984), and Swedish ( Lindqvist
1972 ) studies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#78:1>
As compared to the negligible glottal opening observed for the
unvoiced unaspirated word-final stops in the present study, in the cited
studies a relatively larger glottal opening was observed during these stops.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#79:1>
The data of this study also do not compare well with those reported
from Cantonese ( Iwata et al. 1981 ) and Fukienese ( Iwata et al. 1979 )
where unvoiced unaspirated syllable- or word-final stops were produced in
addition to the closed glottis with a cetain degree of glottalization. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-004#82:1>
For all four words in this figure, the glottis begins to close
rapidly from a respiratory open position and reaches a closed position
considerably prior to the articulatory release of the initial stops and
thereafter remains closed throughout <O> <&> page </&> 8 </O> the rest of the
duration of these words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#83:1>
At or somewhat after the articulatory release of the final stops in
the words / bibib/, / didid/ and / didid/ <*> dots below the three ds </*> ,
the glottis starts opening and then moves rapidly toward a respiratory open
position; the word / gigig/ is an exception, where the glottis continues to
remain closed after the articulatory release of the final stop.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#84:1>
These results are generally in agreement with those reported on the
voiced unaspirated stops in the other Hindi studies ( Dixit and MacNeilage
1974; Dixit 1975; Kagaya and Hirose 1975; Benguerel and Bhatia 1980; Dixit
1989 ) , and in the studies on Dutch ( Slis and Damste 1967 ) , French (
Benguerel et al. 1978 ) , Fukienese ( Iwata et al. 1979 ) , Japanese (
Sawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima et al. 1975 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984 ) , and
Tibetan ( Kjellin 1977 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#85:1>
In these studies, like the present study, the voiced unaspirated
stops were produced with an adducted and vibrating glottis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#86:1>
In spite of the fact that in English ( Lisker and Abramson 1964;
Ladefoged 1975 ) and Swedish ( Lindqvist 1972; Fant 1973 ) , the so-called
voiced stops are truly voiced only in word-medial intervocalic position, in
other positions they may or may not be voiced, most of these stops in all
word positions in these languages were produced with an adducted glottis (
Abramson et al. 1965; Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970; Sawashima et
al. 1970; Cooper et al. 1971; Lindqvist 1972 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#87:1>
In some cases of these stops in both English and Swedish, however,
some glottal opening was observed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#88:1>
Some glottal opening was also observed in a few cases of these stops
in Dutch and French.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#89:1>
In contrast, all of the so-called voiced stops of Danish (
Frojaer-Jensen et al. 1971; Fukui and Hirose 1983; Hutters 1985 ) and
Icelandic ( Petursson 1976; Lofqvist and Yoshioka 1981 ) were produced with
an open glottis an cessation of glottal vibration, thus they were
phonetically realized as unvoiced unaspirated stops in both languages.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#90:1>
Occasional glottal openings observed in the production of the
so-called voiced stops have been attributed to active adjustment of the
arytenoids in English ( Lisker et al. 1970; Sawashima 1970) and to the
increase in oral air pressure in Swedish ( Lindqvst 1972 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#91:1>
Since the so-called voiced stops of Danish were produced with
activation of the abductor and suppression of the adductor laryngeal muscles
( Fischer-Jorgensen and Hirose 1974; Hutters 1985 ) , the glottal opening
observed during their production can be ascribed to active arytenoid
adjustment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-004#92:1>
Lofqvist has suggested that glottal opening observed in the so-called
voiced stops of Icelandic also results from active adjustment of the
arytenoids ( see Dixit 1989 ) </I>
