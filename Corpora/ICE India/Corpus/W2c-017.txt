Indications that wondercraft A320, touted as Indian Airlines
workhorse for the nineties, is congenitally defective </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#4:1>
ALL that was left intact of IC605 was its tail, a morbid symbol of
the way things are run in the domestic airliner, where things happen back
to front.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#5:1>
For Indian Airlines, the much-abused epitome of delays and
inefficiency, the February 14 crash in Bangalore of its proud new
acquisition was another shattering blow to its safety record which anyway was
not high-flying. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#6:1>
The wreckage and the 90 deaths raised a big question mark over the
future of the fleet of the ultra-sophisticated A320 aircraft from Airbus
Industrie of France and the safety standards in the IA.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#7:1>
The feeble protests over inadequate safety measures raised by its
engineers during the schedule-crippling crisis of December-January have now
assumed deafening proportions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#8:1>
At the centre of the raging controversy is A320, a unique aircraft
because of its nature to <quote> 'fly by wire' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#9:1>
One of the most fancied passenger carriers in the international
market, A320 was being projected as the workhorse of the airlines in the
nineties, even as it phased out the Boeing 737s and Airbus A300s.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#10:1>
But now the ominous question is whether this wondercraft has a
congenital defect which makes it disastrous to let loose on the Indian skies,
and especially near Indian runways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#11:1>
The muted whispers of fancy kickbacks ( the total Airbus deal is
bigger than the Bofors deal) are now being openly aired, pointing an accusing
finger at the men who favoured Airbus to Boeing and other competitors.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#12:1>
With Union Civil Aviation Minister Arif Mohammed Khan already
ordering a complete review of the deal, the coming days should see a bitter
controversy raging, with rivals of Airbus adding enough aviation fuel to the
fire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#13:1>
Close on the heels of the debate over the choice of aircraft is
the issue of failure of the administration to conduct an integrated civil
aviation system - - landing and communication facilities and upgraded
training - - along with the new aircraft. <call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#14:1>
With the new Airbus under a cloud, the airline may not go ahead with
the second phase of acquiring 12 more A320s, each costing Rs 65 crore.
</call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#15:1>
<quote> " I am distressed that while hundreds of <indig> crores
</indig> <}> <-> was </-> <+> were </+> </}> spent on the aircraft purchase,
similar investment was not made to improve ground facilities," </quote>
lamented Arif Khan at the crash site.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#16:1>
But now the buck stops with him - - he has to sanction funds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#17:1>
Initial investigations by P.C. Sen, director-general of civil
aviation, and his colleagues shortlisted two likely causes for <w> IC605's
</w> fatal plunge outside the high airport compound wall in east Bangalore -
a screw-up by the <w> plane's </w> sophisticated computer system or pilot
error.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#18:1>
However investigators do not rule out poor landing facilities coupled
with control failure and even sabotage.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#19:1>
But the precise answer can come either from the cockpit voice
recorder or the digital flight data recorder, both of which were found
intact.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#20:1>
<quote> " Till then all we speak will be educated guesswork,"
</quote> pointed out a senior official from Airbus Industrie who accompanied
Jean Paul de Villieneuve, accident investigator of the French transport
ministry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#21:1>
But the Airbus men were upset by the general debunking of their prize
product. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#22:1>
Sen himself refused to hazard a guess on the cause of the crash (
see interview on p. <bold> 44 </bold> ) , but widespread apprehensions have
been expressed about the airworthiness of A320 not only within the country
but even in the west.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#23:1>
The Indian <w> Airline's </w> choice of the engine for the aircraft
has been described as risky. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#24:1>
But the 139 men, women and children who boarded IC605 at the
Santa Cruz airport in Bombay were not experts, nor could they afford to be
fastidious.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#25:1>
They were at the mercy of a national monopoly which brooks no
competition to its charter and which moves in its baffling wayward ways.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#26:1>
Like thousands of air travellers in the country, they too had to put
up with snags and delays.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#27:1>
But compared to the recent track record of the airline in maintaining
its despatch efficiency, it had done rather well with IC605.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#28:1>
It was only slightly late and was a smooth flight till the last fatal
minute.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#29:1>
Several of the passengers were preparing to unclip their safety belts
when tragedy triumphed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#30:1>
When Captain Gopujkar rogered out as 1258 hours to the radar
control, he was six miles away from Bangalore airport and in the final stages
of preparing his craft to land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#31:1>
After sighting runway 09, he called the control tower for details of
weather-wind pressure and moisture and for permission to make his visual
approach landing.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#32:1>
The next two minutes, which will go down in aviation history, <}> <->
holds </-> <+> hold </+> </}> the key to one of the worst air disasters in
India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#33:1>
According to sources in the control tower, the aircraft just
disappeared from the scene and <quote> " it was not where it should have
been, on runway 09, after we last had communication with the pilot of the
craft" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#34:1>
The control tower supervisor feared the worst when he saw billows
of smoke outside the airport and his hand moved to the crash button almost
instinctively.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#35:1>
The alarm bells sprung the initially stunned ground stuff at the
airport into action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#36:1>
According to sources at the airport, the aircraft disappeared
when it was about 2,000 feet from the airport.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#37:1>
<quote> " After the captain announced that we were landing, we
actually found that we were not landing in the airport but on a barren land,"
</quote> said Devidasan, a survivor.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#38:1>
Perhaps even the captain was caught unawares when his craft dipped
suddenly without giving him a chance of regaining the required altitude
for a safe landing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#39:1>
Cutting into some of the treetops and flying miraculously over
some brick-kilns in the vicinity of a new-created golf course, the Airbus
came down on its main wheels with a thud and momentarily went up for about 85
feet.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#40:1>
The second thud shook the craft violently as only the rear wheels hit
the ground.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#41:1>
It was only after rolling for about 185 feet that both the front and
rear wheels were touching the ground.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#42:1>
Perhaps it was at this point that the captain felt he could still
save the situation by lifting the craft once again, but, alas, he had too
little time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#43:1>
The A320 veered for a lift, but only managed to climb the
embankment of the gulf course comprising a 10-foot mud <indig> bund </indig>
, shrubs and trees and a wire fence.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#44:1>
The right engine, sheared from the craft by the impact and fell into
a 12-foot-wide ditch on the other side of the golf course boundary. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#45:1>
The craft was said to be still speeding at over 200 km an hour.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#46:1>
The speed and weight of the craft took it across the ditch and a
15-foot-wide <indig> kuccha </indig> road and into the <indig>
Challaghatta </indig> Tank adjacent to the airport wall.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#47:1>
Parts of the left engine, which had detached itself as the craft
scythed through the road, fell into the tank.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#48:1>
But both the front and rear landing wheels were miraculously intact
although not for long.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#49:1>
The front section of the craft caught fire after two short explosions
<O> drawing </O> <O> extended caption </O> blew away the wheels.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#50:1>
The craft made another 150 feet on its belly before the entire
mid-section too caught fire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#51:1>
As they heard the first explosions, the air hostesses in the rear
section were on their feet.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#52:1>
They urged the passengers in the mid-sections to force open the
emergency <}> <-> eixsts </-> <+> exits </+> </}> and save themselves by
jumping out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#53:1>
But in the panic and confusion, many passengers tried to salvage
their luggage instead of trying to force open the jammed door.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#54:1>
Fortunately, a helping hand had reached the spot - - Prem Kumar, a
commercial staffer of IA.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#55:1>
He was part of a tractor team which had raced to the compound wall
following the emergency signal from the tower.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#56:1>
He scaled the wall and rushed to help some of the passengers who were
unable to run because of smoke and fright.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#57:1>
He then moved to the craft and along with another person, helped
force open the rear door.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#58:1>
<quote> " I helped about 10 to 15 persons, including a five-year-old
girl to jump to safety before I too had to run away when the raging fire
spilled over even the 15-foot-high compound wall," </quote> says Prem Kumar.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#59:1>
Most of the passengers in the front had absolutely no chance of
escape.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#60:1>
According to eyewitnesses, it was the cockpit which exploded
first.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#61:1>
<quote> " The fire came from the front side," </quote> said
Sreedharan who survived along with his three family members.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#62:1>
<quote> " With so many bodies fallen in the passage and in between
the seats, we could not have escaped but for the emergency exit" </quote> ,
added his wife, her fractured left hand is in sling. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#63:1>
According to a technician who was clearing the debris with his
colleagues, <quote> " it was a miraculous survival for many because the rear
fuel tank did not explode." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#64:1>
And, of course, three of the surviving hostesses, Sadhana Pawar,
Sujaya and Neela Sawant, did a courageous job of saving many lives.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#65:1>
The four crew casualties were pilot S.S. Gopujkar, co-pilot Cyril A.
Fernandes, air hostesses Mary Chacko and Lakshmi Swamy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#66:1>
Some of the Japanese passengers claimed that their smoking
habit turned out to be a life-saver.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#67:1>
<X> <quote> " As smokers we were seated in the back of the craft.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#X68:1>
Thus we were able to jump out," </quote> </X> said one of them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#69:1>
For some others, flouting the safety requirement of fastening their
seat belts because of familiarity with air travel turned out to be a
blessing.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#70:1>
According to the first fire tenders and relief team which reached the
crash spot, many women and children buckled to their seats were crying in
panic as fire engulfed them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#71:1>
Some of the charred bodies were still in sitting position and a few
of them even had infants in their arms.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#72:1>
Prominent among the passengers who where strapped to death in the
infernal plane was industrialist Ashok Birla, cousin of Aditya Birla.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#73:1>
His wife and daughter, too, perished. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#74:1>
It was a pathetic scene at the Victoria Hospital morgue.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#75:1>
<quote> " My daughter was wearing a blue <indig> churidar </indig> ,
not a black one," </quote> was the cry of a distraught mother who refused to
believe that her daughter, the occupant of seat 17 - - the label attached to
the charred body - - was dead.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#76:1>
It was extremely difficult for the relatives to identify their kin
among the charred bodies kept on blocks of ice with the customary wreaths
from the Indian Airlines.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#77:1>
Many of the relatives had to make a poignant, at times wild guess
either from the ornaments or the medical reports on the dentures. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#78:1>
The Bangalore airport is controlled by both the ministry of
defence production and the National Airport Authority ( NAA).

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#79:1>
The NAA, though, has no say in air traffic control, radar guidance
and maintenance of the runways.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#80:1>
It was this dual control of the airport which caused the erection of
a 15-foot-high stonewall around the airport for defence security purposes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#81:1>
According to A.C. John, controller of aerodrome, the NAA only
maintained runway lights, radio and navigation lights, an MF band transmitter
with a non-directional beacon, a very high omni-frequency range system (
VHOR) for accurate positioning of the aircraft for landing and a
distance-measuring equipment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#82:1>
The airport also has an automatic direction-finding equipment with a
range of 100 - 150 miles to track flights in the air.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#83:1>
The communications system manned by NAA has a range of nearly 1,000
miles. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#84:1>
In addition, there are the auto visual approach slope indicators
on both sides of the runway to help the pilot to gauge correct altitude and
position himself for a smooth landing.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#85:1>
If a <w> craft's </w> altitude is above safety level, the lights on
the runway turn white and if it is lower they turn red and the right level
for landing is indicated by green lights.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#86:1>
<quote> " This equipment was in perfect functioning order on that
day," </quote> said John. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#87:1>
John admitted that there was no instrument landing system at
the Bangalore airport.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#88:1>
<X> <quote> " And even if it had existed, it would not have helped
the ill-fated IC605.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#X89:1>
As the pilot, after making visual contact of runway 09, had
indicated to the radar and the control tower that he would land on his own,"
</quote> </X> said John. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#90:1>
Ironically the HAL, which has extensive control over the airport
courtesy the ministry of defence production, is not obliged to give access to
the NAA on matters of air traffic control, radar guidance and maintenance of
runways.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#91:1>
Its word is final in these matters.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#92:1>
The NAA operates as many as 22 flights <}> <-> everyday </-> <+>
every day </+> </}> ( eight of them A320s) from the Bangalore airport, but
there are no figures of the flights operated by the defence ministry.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#93:1>
<quote> " At least three flights per hour, either on training or
testing, take off from this airport," </quote> says an airport official.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#94:1>
National priority, coupled with scarcity of land for setting up
another aerodrome, seems to have stifled <w> NAA's </w> cry for independent
control of the airport. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#95:1>
Incidentally, the establishment at Begumpet, Hyderabad, for
training Boeing and Airbus pilots has been rocked by incessant strife during
the last few years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#96:1>
The installation of the simulators for both Airbus 300 and A320 in
Hyderabad was delayed as plans were cleared for setting up a similar training
centre near Delhi by former civil aviation minister Shivraj Patil.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#97:1>
It was only at the fag end of 1988 that the plans were reverted and
the Airbus simulators were sanctioned for the Hyderabad establishment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#98:1>
However, the A320 simulators are yet to be deployed although IA has
pressed 15 such craft into service in the last eight months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#99:1>
Even as all attention was riveted on the Bangalore disaster, the
grounding of another A320 in Hyderabad went almost unnoticed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#100:1>
The Madras-bound IC968 failed to take off from Begumpet airport on
the evening of February 15.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#101:1>
The passengers had a narrow escape because the pilot, who noticed
a fire in the right engine at the point of take-off, taxied back to the
airport.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#102:1>
The passengers were later sent to their destination on a Boeing
training flight!

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#103:1>
The A320, however, recovered from its <quote> 'snag' </quote> to do
a morning run to Delhi the next day.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#104:1>
The authorities, keen to keep the A320 out of further controversy,
described the <quote> 'snag' </quote> as <quote> " routine and normal under
the climatic conditions of Hyderabad." </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#105:1>
The airline, which operates over 200 scheduled flights daily
with its fleet of 30 Boeings 737s, 14 A320s and 11 A300s, finds the increase
in passenger traffic - - 11 per cent last year - - a tough proposition to
handle.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#106:1>
Its efforts to lease aircraft from other airlines have met with
limited success.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#107:1>
After four rounds of negotiations two years ago, IA managed to
persuade the Russian carrier Aeroflot ( which has over 3,000 aircraft) to
wet-lease two aircrafts, one a Tu-154 for medium distances and a Il-62 for
long international flights.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#108:1>
But only the Tu-154 was finally made available and the lease expired
by March-end. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#109:1>
With the new Airbus fleet under a shadow, the airline may not go
ahead with the second phase of acquiring 12 more A320s.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#110:1>
But delays and disruption of schedules have a psychological
impact on the crew and other staff, which again can accentuate the <quote> 'human
error' </quote> factor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#111:1>
<quote> " As long as there is pressure for tickets which we are
unable to meet, compromises will be struck to operate more and more flights,"
</quote> said a former commercial director of the airline who was in
Bangalore, <quote> " and each compromise means a step towards disaster."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-017#112:1>
While the pressure is high to accelerate its customer service
activities rapidly by achieving a hundred per cent despatch schedule, the
safety factors are becoming mind-bogglingly complex.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#113:1>
The man who walked the tight rope getting the <foreign> flak
</foreign> from all sides was Managing Director R. Prasad.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#114:1>
His exit accepting moral responsibility does not mean that the
nightmare has ended for the Indian Airlines.

<ICE-IND:W2C-017#115:1>
It will be a long haul before the airline can fly with its nose up
rather than the tail, as it did with IC605. </p>
