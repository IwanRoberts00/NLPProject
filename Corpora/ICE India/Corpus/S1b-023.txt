<ICE-IND:S1B-023#1:1:A>
<X> <&> In Hindi </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#2:1:B>
You know <w> that's </w> right

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#3:1:B>
Today was <,> uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new
India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#4:1:B>
A day on which we were to <,> radically restructure our <,> our
economic policies

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#5:1:B>
And therefore transit on <,> to a high growth path after a short
period of painful adjustment on

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#6:1:B>
And that was <,> what it was supposed to be

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#7:1:B>
How it turned out to be <,> is really going to be our discussion
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#8:1:B>
We are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have
been in one way or the other involved in this <,> uh exercise to <,> fashions
a brave new India

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#9:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> <,> uh introduce them straight away <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#10:1:B>
Uh Mr Pranab Mukharjee <,> deputy chairman of the planning
commission <,,> Mr Deepak Nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance
Government of India <,,> Mr V K Loria is here as <}> <-> an </-> <+> a </+>
</}> consultant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#11:1:B>
Also with us on the panel <,> uh on our side of the panel is
in-house <O> one word </O> <,> uh Dileep Cherian <,> and therefore <w> I'll
</w> take off by asking Dileep the first question

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#12:1:B>
Dileep do you think uh <,> the way the day has unfolded it was uh
<,> brave new India in the making <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#13:1:C>
<w> I'm </w> not entirely sure whether <w> it's </w> uh <,>
brave enough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#14:1:C>
Sure <,> Mr Manmohan Singh has done <,,> quite a few things that
this country desperately needs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#15:1:C>
<w> It's </w> certainly an economist kind of budget <,,> with lots
of political cheese cake <,> thrown in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#16:1:C>
But the budget has to be really seen <,> in the backdrop of <,> the
other major documents that was presented today <,> which is the industrial
policy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#17:1:C>
As it <,> needed to address <,> in some sense <,> three or four
basic needs of the hour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#18:1:C>
One the need for austerity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#19:1:C>
Second <,> a need to restore confidence in those who seek <,> and
ought to invest in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#20:1:C>
And three to fashion <,> as it were <,> a completely new kind of
economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#21:1:C>
But to my mind <,> the budget <,> does do some other things that is
including these areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#22:1:C>
It certainly delivers <,,> as far as the capital market is
concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#23:1:C>
I think it does <,> some of the much needed reform <,> to the money
market <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#24:1:C>
<w> I'm </w> happy to see <,,> that <,> defence expenditure <,> has
been held at the level at which be held <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#25:1:C>
And <,> a lot of the restructuring in the customs duties <,,> to my
mind <,> move in the right direction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#26:1:C>
But <,> <w> that's </w> not enough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#27:1:C>
I think it disappoints in certain other areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#28:1:C>
Uhm I am not entirely happy with what happened <,> as far as the
public sector is concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#29:1:C>
Neither an industrial policy <,> nor as far as the budget is
concerned are enough signals being given <,> as to what is going to happen in
that area <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#30:1:C>
Not enough is seen as far as <,> curbing of conspicous consumption
<,> that has become <,> a social problem in the country <,> is going to be
done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#31:1:C>
And I am worried about the signals that are sending out <,> for
corporate investment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#32:1:C>
And I think for some reason or the other <,,> perhaps for good
reason of his own <,,> Manmohan Singh seems to have been dissident <,> on
three other areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#33:1:C>
One is <,,> on the business of N R I <,> except for what he has
done as far as <,> gifts are concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#34:1:C>
This doesn't seem to be enough incentive for N R <w> I's </w> <,>
to invest back in India again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#35:1:C>
I am concerned about the <,> hesitation to hit at subsidies <,>
much much harder <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#36:1:C>
And I don't see enough effort <,> in this whole belt tightening
exercise that <w> we've </w> been talking on for so long <,> in tightening of
government expenditure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#37:1:C>
So these to my <,> mind are areas we ought to worry about <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#38:1:C>
There are two more areas <,> that I would think <,> cause concern
today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#39:1:C>
I am worried about the kind of <,> unchecked growth of interest
payment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#40:1:C>
<w> It's </w> forty-two percent now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#41:1:C>
And <,> Dr Singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent
<,> if <w> it's </w> not checked <,> by nineteen ninety-four nineteen
ninety-five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#42:1:C>
And <,,> this would have been a very good time <,> to get rid of
that <,,> burden of <,> debt release to rural sector <,,> which seems to <,>
be uh costing the economy <}> <-> about </-> <=> for </=> </}> four thousand
five hundred <indig> crores </indig> <,> in the three year period that we are
looking at <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#43:1:C>
These to my mind are areas of concerned today <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#44:1:A>
<X> <&> A summary of Mr <w> Cherian's </w> view is repeated in
Hindi </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#45:1:B>
I see that uh <,> Mr Mukharjee has got the <,> congress
manifesto

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#46:1:B>
Open to page twenty-two <}> <-> which says </-> <,> <=> which says
</=> </}> the economy <,> uh Mr Mukharjee <w> I'm </w> sure you agree with
Dileep when he says that it delivers on A B M C <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#47:1:B>
But <w> I'm </w> sure you have uh difference with him <}> <-> when
</-> <=> when </=> </}> he says that <w> it's </w> diffident <,> disappoints
<,> and areas of concerned <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#48:1:D>
Uh <,> firstly I would like to point out <,,> that <,> budget
is one instrument <,,> followed with many other <,> which reflects the <,>
<w> government's </w> policy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#49:1:D>
And particularly this <w> year's </w> budget is to be <,> reviewed
<,> in the context of <,,> industrial policy resolution <,> which has been
announced <,> this morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#50:1:D>
Trade policy <,> <}> <-> which has </-> <,> <=> which was </=> </}>
announced a little <,> earlier <,> and certain <,> readjustment programme
which have been initiated by the <,> government itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#51:1:D>
Congress as a party <,,> was committed <,> to the electorate of
this country <,,> to restore balance <,> in the economic system <,,> and <,>
wanted to <,,> put the economy on rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#52:1:D>
Therefore certain structural adjustment <,> were absolutely needed
<,> if we wanted to come out of wood <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#53:1:D>
To my mind <,> this budget <,,> is an adjustment budget <,> in the
sense <,> it has initiated <,> a large number of message <,> which will pay
dividend <,> in course of time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#54:1:D>
Bold initiative was needed <,> and bold initiative <,> has been
taken <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#55:1:B>
Uh pardon me for interrupting Mr Mukharjee now

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#56:1:B>
Uh Dileep made a point and he says that <,> he is disappointed <,>
uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance <,> <{> <[> uh
uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#57:1:B>
The expectation was that <-> it would </-> much more would be done

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#58:1:D>
<[> Uh uh </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#59:1:D>
<w> I'm </w> coming to that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#60:1:D>
If you look at the <,,> industrial policy resolution <,,> and the
proposals in the budget <,> you will find that what we committed <,> we have
done it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#61:1:D>
Firstly <,> the area of operation of public sector has been limited
<,> and more areas have been open to <,> private sector <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#62:1:D>
This investment <,> in the public sector <,> has been announced in
the <,> budget <,> and through these process <,> public sector would be made
<,> more accountable <,> competitive <,> and it would <,> serve the social
<,,> obligation <,> for which the public sector institutions are built up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#63:1:D>
Even <,> his comment in respect of the <,> for instance <,,> uh our
liabilities towards the interest <,> payment

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#64:1:D>
I do agree <,> that it is <,> uh sizeably of high order <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#65:1:D>
But what can you do <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#66:1:D>
No finance minister can say <,> that he will not fulfill the
commitment <,> by paying interest on the <,> past borrowing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#67:1:D>
Therefore <,> finance minister has made it quite clear in his
statement <,> that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified
<,> over the period of year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#68:1:D>
Certain time will be needed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#69:1:D>
<w> That's </w> why this <w> year's </w> borrowing has been <,>
limited <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#70:1:D>
Even <,> the reduction of non-developmental expenditure <,>
non-planned expenditure is substantial <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#71:1:D>
And the budget has given a clear message what the government feels
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#72:1:B>
Uh uh may I <,> may I just take up from <,> uh there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#73:1:B>
Deduction in non-planned expenditure <,> is something that I would
like to ask uh <,> Mr Nair this question <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#74:1:B>
Uh may be we had a gap of information

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#75:1:B>
So therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#76:1:B>
Is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure <,> is
down by four point nine percent <,> if you exclude interest payment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#77:1:B>
And in the very next line <,> uh you go on to say that actually it
is down by over fifteen percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#78:1:B>
Now these are two uh <,> <}> <-> is it </-> <=> is it </=> </}>
that eleven point two percent went down on government uh <,> on the interest
payment <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#79:1:E>
Now let me explain <,,> non-planned expenditure <,> excluding
interest payment <,> in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one
ninety-two <,> is four point nine percent lower <,> than the revised estimate
<,> for nineteen ninety ninety-one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#80:1:E>
Now if we had introduced low <O> one word </O> <,> and expenditure
<,> non-planned expenditure <,> <}> <-> has <.> con </.> </-> <=> had
continued </=> </}> in keeping with past trend <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#81:1:E>
Then the level would have which would have wished <,> uh is the
level from which have attend the fifteen percent production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#82:1:E>
So fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis <,> <{> <[> so if you <,> four
point nine percent is with respect to <,> the non-planned expenditure of past
year

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#83:1:B>
<[> So if you </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#84:1:B>
It is in a sense <}> <-> <.> phenomi </.> </-> <=> phenominal
</=> </}> figure <w> it's </w> not a real figure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#85:1:B>
Because I think the budget says that <w> it's </w> sixty-two
thousand <indig> crore rupees </indig> it would have reached had low
corrective been applied

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#86:1:E>
That that refers to fiscal deficit <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#87:1:C>
May I <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#88:1:E>
You know I believe that the union budget for nineteen
ninety-one ninety-two <,,> must be situated in the wider context <,> of the
crisis in the economy <,> that is both acute <,> and deep <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#89:1:E>
Micro economic imbalances <,> lie at the root of this problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#90:1:E>
The government has leaped beyond its means <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#91:1:E>
It has done so by borrowing at home <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#92:1:E>
The country has leaped beyond its means <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#93:1:E>
It has done so by borrowing abroad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#94:1:E>
Now <w> I'm </w> sure you would accept <,> that neither the
government <,> nor the country <,> can afford to leap beyond its means year
after year <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#95:1:D>
But these are

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#96:1:E>
Now

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#97:1:B>
I am sorry I mean <,> would you say that <,> the kind of <,>
pace at which <,> the adjustment of living beyond <w> one's </w> means <,> is
being done fast enough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#98:1:B>
At this point of time <,> given the crisis we have <,> the
adjustment could have been sweeped up <,> and more substantive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#99:1:B>
The same incentive <,> and the same <O> one word </O> is that as it
was <,> may not be there next year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#100:1:B>
When you <O> two words </O> when the finance minister present his
budget <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#101:1:E>
I do not agree <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#102:1:E>
Look <,> any further postponement of micro-economic adjustment <,>
which is long over due <,> uh would make an exceedingly difficult <{> <[>
situation </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#103:1:B>
<[> No <w> I'm </w> not </[> </{> asking about the question I
think <&> <O> two or three persons speaking together </O> <&>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#104:1:E>
No <,> not at all <,> uh I believe that what we have achieved
in this year <,> in terms of a credible fiscal adjustment <,> which I hope
would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial
year <,> and continued fiscal consolidation thereafter is impressive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#105:1:E>
Let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit <,>
which is the borrowing <,> the short term borrowing of the government from
the <mention> Reserve Bank of India </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#106:1:E>
Let us look at the revenue deficit <,> which is the difference
between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#107:1:E>
Or the fiscal deficit <,> which is the difference between the
revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by
borrowing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#108:1:E>
Now what we have done this year <,> is to reduce both the revenue
deficit <,> and the fiscal deficit <,> not simply in absolute terms <,> as
compared to last year

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#109:1:E>
But <,> in very substantial terms as a proportion of G D P <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#110:1:E>
Now the fiscal deficit <,> is going to come down <,> by two
percent in point of G D P <,> that is about twelve thousand <indig> crores
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#111:1:E>
Dileep <,> that is not insubstantial <,> that is very substantial

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#112:1:E>
Now we are <,> <w> we're </w> achieving this by two means <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#113:1:E>
On one hand <,> you have revenue received two thousand <indig>
crores </indig> of additional resource mobilization <,> that is both
progressive and non-inflationary <,> and two thousand five hundred <indig>
crores </indig> <O> a few words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#114:1:B>
So we come to <,> Mr Loria uh <,> let us get quick comment
<,> Dileep on what Mr Mukharjee said <,> then what Mr Nair said and then uh
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#115:1:C>
No as far as the <,> forces of adjustment having begun I
certainly have no quarrel

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#116:1:C>
But I think this <,> we didn't have very much choice <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#117:1:C>
The second factor we need to <,> look at in this budget is the
context in which it was written in a sense <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#118:1:C>
Meaning we have to make sure that we confirm <,> to certain needs
of <,> the international community which is one of the potential lenders <,>
that needs to have confidence in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#119:1:C>
The point that is some how seems to worry is that <,,> I <,> worry
because the political will <,> to do change <,> is most when the crisis is
more secured <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#120:1:C>
And I do think that the backdrop of the <,> kind of manifesto that
the Congress had which before it came into power as you hear <,> allowed for
many of these changes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#121:1:C>
Some of them are there in the industrial policy <,> some are there
in trade policy

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#122:1:C>
But more could have been achieved is what I feel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#123:1:C>
And if the pressure is off <,> I worry that the <,> pressure on
the ministry <,> on the finance ministry <,> in a sense to do this is to be
<{> <[> reduced </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#124:1:B>
<[> Dileep </[> </{> let us now speak of uh <,> some way <{>
<[> where you left off that </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#125:1:C>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{> yeah okay <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#126:1:A>
<X> <&> A summary of Mr <w> Mukharjee's </w> view is repeated
in Hindi </&> </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#127:1:B>
Vinod <w> let's </w> now get the voice of uh <,> industry and
uh <,> the professional sector <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#128:1:B>
Mr Loria what do you think uh <,> there are some confusing or uh
<,> one can say not very uh <,> encouraging signal for the corporate sector
for instance the deputation has been stuck <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#129:1:B>
Uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#130:1:B>
And then the three main fears of industry which was <,> in both
<?> confession </?> which was <,> uh the liquidity squeeze and which was
inflation <,> are still there <,> are still hanging over industry

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#131:1:B>
So how do you expect industry <,> to react to this budget <,> ?

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#132:1:F>
Well I will put it this way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#133:1:F>
Uh I I first like to make a very brief comment on what I think of
the budget <,> I think <w> it's </w> <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#134:1:B>
<[> Sure </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-023#135:1:F>
And I <,> it we may not be awakening to a brave new year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#136:1:F>
But we have certainly not going to awaken every year <,> to a
brand new budget <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#137:1:F>
This has set the pace <,> it has set a new path <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-023#138:1:F>
And I think <,> from next year onwards <,> we will not wait for
this day with bated breath <,> </I>
