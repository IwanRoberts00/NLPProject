<h> <bold> <it> A CHANGE OF </it> <it> HEART </it> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#4:1>
<bold> Mrs </bold> Rukmini Iyer grumbled incessantly as she peeled
and chopped the small onions for her <indig> sambar </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#5:1>
The tears in her eyes were not due to the pungence of the onions.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#6:1>
They were tears of frustration and rage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#7:1>
<quote> " How could he do this after all I have done for him?"
</quote> she lamented.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#8:1>
<quote> " It is my misfortune that I gave birth to such a stupid boy."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#9:1>
She wiped the tears away with the corner of her <indig> pallu
</indig> and continued chopping the vegetables with uncharacteristic
violence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#10:1>
<quote> " If only Nandu had told me to find a good bride for him,
I would have lined up at least 20 girls for his approval.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#11:1>
After all, he is so good-looking, fair and intelligent and is working
in the USA.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#12:1>
But he had to go and get married to some hussy there!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#13:1>
<w> Rukmini's </w> tears continued to flow unabated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#14:1>
Narasimha, lovingly called Nandu by everyone, was her only son.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#15:1>
He was a neuro-surgeon working in the USA.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#16:1>
Rukmini, his mother, had brought him up all by herself after the
death of her husband.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#17:1>
Narasimha had never seen his <w> mother's </w> grief or cry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#18:1>
She was a strong woman who had struggled against all odds to educate
him in the best of schools and put him through medical college. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#19:1>
He had been a brilliant student who had always earned
scholarships throughout his academic career.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#20:1>
He loved and adored his mother and declared to everyone that she was
his ideal in every way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#21:1>
It had been a tough decision for him when he had to leave his
mother alone and go to the USA for specialisation in neuro-surgery. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#22:1>
<quote> " I will stay here and do whatever I can," </quote> he had
insisted.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#23:1>
<quote> " You will do nothing of the sort.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#24:1>
I am healthy and strong.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#25:1>
I can stay by myself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#26:1>
You must not forget that your father had always wanted you to be a
surgeon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#27:1>
It is our duty to fulfil his wishes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#28:1>
I have worked so hard to fulfil that dream and now you are telling me
that you won't go for your specialisation!" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#29:1>
Rukmini had been furious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#30:1>
All through his childhood and youth, Narasimha had struggled to
fulfil the dreams of his parents.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#31:1>
He had worked hard day and night so that he could excel in his
studies. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#32:1>
<quote> " But Amma, I won't feel comfortable leaving you all alone."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#33:1>
<quote> " I won't listen to anything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#34:1>
You must go and finish your specialisation." </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#35:1>
She had literally thrown him out of the house!

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#36:1>
And then Narasimha had excelled in his specialisation just as he had
always excelled in everything he did.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#37:1>
He had gone on to become a renowned neurosurgeon in New York. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#38:1>
His zeal to achieve excellence had been triggered in his
childhood by the tragic demise of his father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#39:1>
<w> Narasimha's </w> father had suffered brain haemorrhage after a
road accident and died because he had not been operated upon by a good
neuro-srugeon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#40:1>
Then and there Rukmini had decided that her son would be a
neuro-surgeon, and the best one in the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#41:1>
After finishing his specialisation Narasimha had no problem
getting a job in one of the best hospitals in New York.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#42:1>
He had taken an apartment and bought all the luxuries of life,
including a fancy car. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#43:1>
He had installed a phone in the house at Bangalore and spoke to
his mother every week, without fail.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#44:1>
He had also got the old cottage redone by an interior decorator and
provided a lot of luxuries for his mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#45:1>
<quote> " Why are you wasting so much money?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#46:1>
Rukmini had asked, peeved at the expenses of it all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#47:1>
<quote> " I am quite comfortable living the way I have always
lived.</+>"</+> </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#48:1>
<quote> <bold> <+> " </+> I</bold> don't need a well-furnished,
modern house nor do I know how to use half the gadgets you have installed in
the house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#49:1>
I don't even need the telephone." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#50:1>
<quote> " But I need it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#51:1>
I am constantly worrying about you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#52:1>
If I speak to you on the phone I feel relieved.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#53:1>
As for the gadgets they are quite easy to operate, <w> I'll </w>
teach you how to operate them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#54:1>
At this age, you can't still be using the grinding <O> <&> page </&>
60 </O> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> stone for everything." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#55:1>
The only thing Rukmini enjoyed was the colour television and the
dish antenna.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#56:1>
She loved switching channels and watching programmes all through the
day and late into the night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#57:1>
It helped her pass time and fight the loneliness that was creeping in
with age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#58:1>
<bold> Things </bold> had been going very well for them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#59:1>
Once Narasimha had established himself, he asked Rukmini to join him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#60:1>
Although Rukmini was not very keen on leaving the country, she was
seized with a desire to see the success of her brilliant son and enjoy the
importance of being the mother of a renowned surgeon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#61:1>
Rukmini hated the idea of flying, she did not trust aeroplanes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#62:1>
<quote> <+> " </+> If there is an accident on land, one can at
least hope to escape with <w> one's </w> life but if one falls from the sky,
what chances does one have?" </quote> she would ask her son. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#63:1>
<quote> " Oh <indig> Amma </indig> ! One doesn't fall from the
sky and there won't be an aircrash.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#64:1>
Don't worry!" </quote> Narasimha had assured her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#65:1>
At last Rukimini had relented and agreed to visit her son.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#66:1>
It had been 5 years since her son had gone to the USA and she was
quite keen to see the way he lived. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#67:1>
Narasimha also wanted his mother to stay with him at New York.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#68:1>
He had been worried about her failing health and wanted to keep her
with him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#69:1>
Rukmini was enraptured by the cleanliness and bustle around her
as she landed at the J F Kennedy Airport where her dutiful son was waiting to
receive her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#70:1>
<quote> " I must say that America is a very clean place,"
</quote> she remarked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#71:1>
<quote> " Neither the Bangalore airport nor the Chennai airport was
as clean." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#72:1>
Narasimha smiled as he loaded her luggage into his car and drove
her to his apartment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#73:1>
Rukmini was spellbound by the sights.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#74:1>
She was like a little child who had been taken to a big fair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#75:1>
Her son was amused at the way his mother reacted to everything. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#76:1>
<quote> " You will enjoy living here, <indig> Amma </indig> , "
</quote> he said.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#77:1>
When they reached the apartment block where Narasimha lived, he
said hesitantly, <quote> " <indig> Amma </indig> , I have a surprise for
you." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#78:1>
The note in his voice made his mother suspicious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#79:1>
<bold> Rukmini </bold> stared sharply at him as they rode the
elevator to the twenty-third floor.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#80:1>
Narasimha avoided her stare and fiddled with the luggage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#81:1>
He rang the doorbell and the door was thrown open by a young
American woman.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#82:1>
She bent down and touched <w> Rukmini's </w> feet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#83:1>
Rukmini shot a look at her son and asked, <quote> " Nandu, I hope
this is not the surprise you were speaking about." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#84:1>
Her son looked sheepish and said, <quote> " <indig> Amma </indig>
, this is Linda.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#85:1>
She is a gynaecologist in my hospital.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#86:1>
We got married last month." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#87:1>
Seeing the horrified look on his <w> mother's </w> face, he
rushed to explain, <quote> " She is a very nice person <indig> Amma </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#88:1>
You will not have any problems with her." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#89:1>
With all the strength she could muster, Rukmini slapped her son.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#90:1>
There was a stunned silence as both Linda and Narasimha looked at
each other.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#91:1>
The next moment Rukmini broke into loud sobs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#92:1>
Linda quickly rushed in and brought a glass of water for Rukmini
but she refused to touch it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#93:1>
<quote> " Do you think I will drink water served by this woman
and forget the rules of my religion?" </quote> she <O> <&> page </&> 62 </O>
asked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#94:1>
Narasimha looked totally aghast.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#95:1>
He had not anticipated such a violent reaction from his mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#96:1>
He had not informed his mothere about the marriage because he knew
that she would not understand his feelings for Linda.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#97:1>
It was difficult trying to tell her about such matters on the phone.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#98:1>
<bold> He </bold> had expected things to be set right when Rukmini
came and stayed with them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#99:1>
He had warned Linda that things may not be easy but she was now
flabbergasted.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#100:1>
The little old lady was much tougher than she had expected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#101:1>
<quote> " I am not going to stay here.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#102:1>
Nandu, put me on the next flight to India." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#103:1>
No amount of convincing, cajoling or compelling had worked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#104:1>
Rukmini was a stubborn woman and none of <w> Narasimha's </w> pleas
had worked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#105:1>
She refused to eat at the same table with Linda and treated her like
an untouchable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#106:1>
<quote> " I should have gone away for sometime and come back
when she had settled down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#107:1>
I think we handled it all wrong," </quote> said Linda.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#108:1>
<quote> " Maybe it was too much for her to handle.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#109:1>
Arriving to a new place and then the shock of finding her son
married to a white woman." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#110:1>
<quote> " No Linda, it was not your fault.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#111:1>
I should have broken the news gradually and gently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#112:1>
You are right, the shock of landing in an alien place and finding me
married, was too much for her," </quote> admitted Narasimha. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#113:1>
In the meantime, Rukmini refused to eat anything that Linda had
cooked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#114:1>
<quote> " We are lyers, Brahmins of the highest order.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#115:1>
How can you expect me to accept a woman whom we treat as
untouchable?

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#116:1>
Thank God your father is not alive.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#117:1>
He would have died of shock if he were alive," </quote> she scolded
her son. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#118:1>
Narasimha knew his <w> mother's </w> stubbornness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#119:1>
He knew that she would not relent and that there was no point in
trying to force her to.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#120:1>
When all his pleas failed, he bought her a ticket to go back to
India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#121:1>
<quote> " <indig> Amma </indig> , when you go back, give this
careful thought.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#122:1>
Linda is a good woman and I love her very much.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#123:1>
We are married now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#124:1>
Even if I have done something wrong, you must forgive me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#125:1>
I want you to come and live with us." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#126:1>
<quote> " Never!" </quote> said Rukmini vehemently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#127:1>
<quote> " I will never live with you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#128:1>
I don't want your money, either.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#129:1>
I will go back to Bangalore and live on my own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#130:1>
You don't have to worry about me." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#131:1>
And Rukmini had gone back to her old house at Bangalore.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#132:1>
All her life she had been a staunch Brahmin, observing all the rules
and rituals of the religion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#133:1>
She could not change them, now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#134:1>
Narasimha tried to explain things to her in a long letter, he also
called her up, repeatedly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#135:1>
But the stubborn old lady refused to relent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#136:1>
She did not touch the money sent by her son, either.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#137:1>
It was a friend who suggested that she should rent out the 2-room
unit on the first floor. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#138:1>
<quote> " You will get enough rent to live comfortably and <w>
you'll </w> have company, too.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#139:1>
As it is, the rooms are lying vacant." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#140:1>
<quote> " But I will only rent it out to a bachelor or a young
girl.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#141:1>
I don't want a family staying in those 2 rooms, what with the water
shortage and other problems," </quote> she decided. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#142:1>
Rukmini put in an add in the Sunday newspaper.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#143:1>
A steady stream of hopefuls had trooped in to see the place.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#144:1>
Rukmini was determined that the rooms would go to a vegetarian
Brahmin only.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#145:1>
That had narrowed down the choice considerably.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#146:1>
She had spoken to about 10 persons but didn't find anyone she liked.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#147:1>
It was towards the evening that a young man approached her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#148:1>
He reminded her of Nandu.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#149:1>
She couldn't put her finger on it but there was something very
familiar about the fellow. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#150:1>
<quote> " What is your name, young man?" </quote> she asked gruffly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#151:1>
<quote> " My name is Narendra," </quote> said the young man.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#152:1>
He was desperate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#153:1>
He had heard about the rooms and also about the preconditions that
must be fulfilled in order to get them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#154:1>
His name was not Narendra, it was Neil.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#155:1>
But he lied so that he could take the rooms on rent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#156:1>
He had been house-hunting for one whole week and if he didn't
find one in another 2 days, he would have to go back to his village, leaving
the plum job that he was getting. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#157:1>
<quote> " Which State do you belong to?" </quote> asked Rukmini.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#158:1>
<quote> " I am a Goan," </quote> he replied.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#159:1>
<quote> " But Goans are mostly Christians," </quote> she stated
suspiciously.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#160:1>
<quote> " No.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#161:1>
I belong to a Saraswat Brahmin family.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#162:1>
My grandfather settled down in Goa." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#163:1>
<quote> " I hope you do not eat non-vegetarian food," </quote>
probed Rukmini.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#164:1>
<quote> " Never.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#165:1>
I am a pure vegetarian." </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#166:1>
<quote> " I will give you the rooms on rent but you have to
abide by a few rules.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#167:1>
First, I do not like loud music, so you will not play music loudly;
secondly, you will return home by a reasonable hour because the gate is
common to both of us and I like to lock it by 10 PM.<+>"</+> </quote> </p>

<p>

<quote> <+> " </+> <bold> Thirdly </bold>, I do not want you to

<p>

<quote> " Anything you say is all right by me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#173:1>
I will abide by all your rules.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#174:1>
Please do not worry," </quote> interrupted Neil. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#175:1>
<quote> " Well, then you must pay me an <O> <&> page </&> 63
</O> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> advance of Rs. 4,500 which is equal
to 3 <w> months' </w> rent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#176:1>
Once you pay the amount, I will give you the keys.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#177:1>
But remember, young man, if you break any of my rules, I will throw
you out of the house." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#178:1>
Neil smiled mischievously and replied, <quote> " I will never
give you the opportunity to do so." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-015#179:1>
He shifted in, bag and baggage, the next day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#180:1>
He was very careful not to give her a chance to complain.

<ICE-IND:W2F-015#181:1>
