<ICE-IND:S1B-036#1:1:A>
With the end of the cold war <,,> and the dismemberament of the
Soviet Union <,,> there have been many dramatic changes <,,> in the
international scenario <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#2:1:A>
One of the healthy developments has been the change <,> in the
relations between India <,> and Britain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#3:1:A>
As they were our colonial past <,,> and after independence <,> a
number of issues had forward our relations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#4:1:A>
Foremost amongst those <,> was the question of Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#5:1:A>
Just next month <,> two very significant results are going to take
place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#6:1:A>
The British Home Secretary <,> their Home Minister that is Mr
Kenneth Clerk <,> will be coming in the first week of January <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#7:1:A>
And this visit will be followed <,> by that of <-> the </-> their
Prime Minister <,> Mr John Major <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#8:1:A>
We have here with us <,> Dr L M Singhavi <,> our High Commissioner
to Britain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#9:1:A>
He is here for <,> pre-visit consultations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#10:1:A>
And <w> we're </w> going to take this opportunity <,> of exchanging
some views <,> about the significance of the visit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#11:1:A>
Dr Singhavi how do you <,> view this visit <,> of what <O> one word
</O> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#12:1:B>
These visits represents <,,> a <,,> remarkable new phase <,>
of Indo-British togetherness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#13:1:B>
As <,> the British Foreign Secretary once said <,> <quote> we no
longer wrangle <,> about problems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#14:1:B>
We sit together and resolved them </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#15:1:B>
And I think these uh <,,> uh <,,> that the year and a half <,,>
that is there <,> had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative
change <,,> in <,,> that relationship <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#16:1:B>
We have been trying to resolve problems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#17:1:B>
We are trying to evolve that equation <,,> which is durable <,,>
and meaningful <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#18:1:B>
And where we both <,> share <,,> or uh view points <,,> and we care
for each others concerns

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#19:1:A>
So what is the attitude <,> now <,,> as <O> one word </O> in
regard to the Kashmir problem <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#20:1:B>
When I went there I found that <,,> the situation <,> was
considerably confused <,,> partly because I think <,,> in the Labour Party
there was an inadequate appreciation <,> of the historical background <,,> of
the legal implications <,,> and <,,> of <,> the ground situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#21:1:B>
Today we have a situation when <,> the shadow <,> Foreign Secretary
<,> Mr Jack Cunningham <,,> called on me some time ago at the High Commission
<,,> held the press conference <,,> and made very positive <,> clear-cut <,>
unambiguous statements <,> with regards to Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#22:1:B>
There is no doubt that they are very much concerned <,,> about
allegation of human rights <,> violations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#23:1:B>
But there is also no doubt <,> that they regard <,> Kashmir as an
integral part of India <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#24:1:A>
But this is very different to <,> what the former shadow <,>
Foreign Minister of the Labour Party said after his visit to India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#25:1:A>
He was rather critical about it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#26:1:B>
Uh <,> well <,> Mr <?> Jerim Cockson </?> was very critical
about us before he came here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#27:1:B>
But after he came he had made <,,> a considerable change <,,> in
the position that he has taken earlier <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#28:1:B>
But I must say in fairness <,> that Mr Jerim Cockson eventually
came to a position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#29:1:B>
Which is <,,> very much more favourable to India <,> than <,> it
ever was <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#30:1:B>
In fact when I went there <,> he used the word occupying part for
India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#31:1:B>
When I took exception to it <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> he was good enough
<,> to say I am extremely sorry that I used that expression <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#32:1:B>
On the whole during this period <,> not only <,> the Labour Party
<,,> not only the ruling part <,> not only the Liberal Party <,> but <,> the
people as a whole has come to understand our position better <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#33:1:B>
They sympathise with our opposition <,,> much more <,> and they
share a lot of our perspective <,> in these matters <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#34:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#35:1:A>
To what extent uh <,> would you attribute this <,,> uh to
England itself now <,,> emerging <,> more and more as a <}> <-> multi </->
<,> <=> multi </=> </}> ethnic community <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#36:1:A>
Because this was a common base to me <,,> that the British uh <,>
government and people are also very concern <,> of containing religious <,>
racial and ethnics rights in England <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#37:1:A>
And therefore they <,> better understand <,,> uh the problems
countries like India face <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#38:1:A>
Uh when uh <,> forces <,> for their own aim <,> try to use religion
<,> or <,> language <,> or race <,> to try and divide and create conflict <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#39:1:B>
But <w> that's </w> only one of the many dimensions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#40:1:B>
It is an input no doubt

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#41:1:B>
But I think <,,> the more direct input in <,> this whole situation
is <,> their coming closer <,> towards understanding of our position <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#42:1:B>
Therefore <w> it's </w> the question of terrorist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#43:1:B>
I decide in to put my case directly <,> as a case has to be put
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#44:1:B>
We decided <,> that they must <,,> have <,,> a <,,> full encounter
with the evidence that we have <,> of the involvement <,> of our neighbouring
country <,> in the export of terrorrism <,> in the funding and training of
terrorist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#45:1:B>
And we share that openly <,> with the British government

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#46:1:A>
Yes this was an issue which was always rankling <,,> uh
between us <,> and the the signing of the Expression Treaty <,> is <,> an
extremely significant and important one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#47:1:A>
And I am glad that they do <,> realize the <,> importance that we
<,,> attach to the type of systems <,> perhaps perceived by us <,> and not
actually happening there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#48:1:A>
There assistants that <,,> was being given or at least the <,> <w>
Nelson's </w> eye being turned <,> to the activities of terrorist in <,> uh
in Britain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#49:1:A>
Uh how do you <,> uh evaluate this yourself <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#50:1:B>
No <,> I <,,> put before the British government <,,> the
perceptions that both India and Britain <,> are victim states of terrorist
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#51:1:B>
That both of us <,> have to face the situation <,,> in a similar
manner <,> and that both of us <,> us must collaborate <,> in meeting
terrorist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#52:1:B>
Now Britain <,> came out clearly <,,> large and clear <,> on the
question of terrorism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#53:1:B>
The question was <,> what do we do about it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#54:1:B>
When I reopened <,> what was regarded as a close chapter <,> on the
Extradition Treaty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#55:1:B>
And what is more important the <,,> agreement on the confiscation
of terrorist related <,> and drug related ethics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#56:1:B>
I found <,,> for the first time <,> when we had prepared the ground
<,> and openess <,> and there is <?> activity </?> <,> in Britain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#57:1:B>
And we have established a bi-lateral arrangement <,> which may
well pave the way for India <,> to contribute to a global <,> regime <,>
against terrorism <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#58:1:A>
This is very healthy <,> very good <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#59:1:A>
There are sir now also to the economic side

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#60:1:A>
I think that is <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> uh foremost in or mind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#61:1:A>
<w> We'll </w> have such <,> old ancient <,> economic links with
<,> Britain <,> special ones <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#62:1:A>
Uh could you give us <,> your own thoughts on this <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#63:1:A>
How do you see <,> increase possibilities of increased <,>
investments <,> from uh <,> British Industries ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#64:1:A>
Now I want to put them a little seperate to the NRI <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#65:1:A>
Because the <w> NRI's </w> have now become <,> extremely important
in England <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#66:1:A>
And our nationals have <,> really contributed very <,> uh
creditably <,> to the development of <w> Britain's </w> economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#67:1:A>
And <w> they're </w> also greatly interested in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#68:1:A>
Perhaps <,> uh some comments from you on both the sides

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#69:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#70:1:B>
Yes <,> uh first let me speak about the NRI and then the main
stream <,,> investment <,,> potential from Britain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#71:1:B>
Uh to this acronym <,,> NRI <,> <w> I've </w> given <,> <w> I've
</w> spelt it out as the national result of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#72:1:B>
Uh they are a tremendous resource for Indian diplomacy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#73:1:B>
Long ago when I was in Parliament <,> in nineteen sixty-two <,> I
took up this issue with the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#74:1:B>
Well the government did not regard it <,> any part of their
obligation <,> to cultivate them <,> or to regard them <,> as <,,> Indians
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#75:1:B>
Now I <,> felt that these children of mother India must be
acknowledged <,,> because I found <,,> that <,> in their heart there was very
deep love and attachment to India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#76:1:B>
Now <w> NRI's </w> <,> have done well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#77:1:B>
They would be a useful catalyst <,,> in our country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#78:1:B>
They would like to have a relationship <,,> which enables them to
stay where they are <,> and to do something for <,> our country <,> which
they regard <,> also as their mother country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#79:1:B>
Now <,> from that point of view <,> they won't <O> one word </O> a
nationality

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#80:1:B>
I have placed <,> several proposals <,> with regard to <,> this
whole concept to <O> one word </O> nationality <,> and how it can be made
operational

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#81:1:B>
I do hope <,> that some <{> <[> decisions </[> should be taken
before long <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#82:1:B>
But the <w> NRI's </w> <,,> has a tremendous contribution to make
both in terms of technology transfer <,> in terms of investments <,> in terms
of contributing to <,> the <,,> general climate for investments <,> in our
country

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#83:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#84:1:A>
I would also say <,> I would also say they have a <,> very
major role <,> to play in <,> improving Indo-British relations in general <{>
<[> very much </[> because <w> they've </w> become <,> <w> they've </w>
become fairly active also on the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#85:1:B>
<[> Very much </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#86:1:B>
Yes yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#87:1:A>
On the political side

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#88:1:A>
<{> <[> And </[> I think <w> they're </w> <,> they are a group of
people <,> whether you call them <w> NRI's </w> or people of Indian origin I
mean <,,> this <,> what you call is debatable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#89:1:A>
But this group <,> are ones which we should pay very much more
attention to and I <w> I'm </w> glad that we are doing so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#90:1:B>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#91:1:B>
<w> That's </w> true <,> I made this my business to cultivate
them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#92:1:B>
Uh <,> a very large significance <,> uh eternal constituency <,> of
support <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#93:1:B>
Even if I take my job to be a credit to the people of Great Britain
<,> they are a segment <,> of that population <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#94:1:B>
And in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people <,> and
not only to the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#95:1:B>
And <w> they're </w> a very important positive group for India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#96:1:B>
But that apart <,> the NRI have also <,> one very important
contribution to make <,> and that is <,> the constant positive projection of
India <,> among the people they live <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#97:1:B>
And that is <,> something which we cannot do on the same scale as
they can <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#98:1:B>
About the other hand <,> the main stream investments here <,,>
about which <,> I have great enthusiasm <,> and great expectations <,,> or
held that today because <,> of a strong recessionary phase <,> in the
Europian and the British economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#99:1:B>
But had to understand that in this recessionary phase <,> you
cannot have received <?> buoyancy </?> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#100:1:B>
On the other hand <,> for instance <,> when it comes to NRI <,>
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom
<,,> ah Britain the sterling area <,> contributed <,,> in such an enoromous
measure <,> and such an unexpectedly large way

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#101:1:B>
That <,> today <,,> from a reserve of one million <,,> or less
which was very small <,> we have a reserve of eight point eight million <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#102:1:B>
This is the situation to which NRI have made a very useful
contribution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#103:1:B>
Now the main stream investors <,> the money managers <,> the
bankers <,> or <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#104:1:B>
But <,> it takes a lot of time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#105:1:B>
Britain is not only <w> Britain's </w> financial market <,> is a
world financial market <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#106:1:B>
And we have <,> been able to make <,> considerable impact <,> on
the city of London <,> on the <,> money managers <,> on the <,> potential
investors <,> to all thing <,> that they cannot afford to miss the
opportunity of investments <,> in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#107:1:B>
Last year <,> Mr Bhandari <w> I've </w> brought a very large group
<,> of British investors <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> the top of the shares company
<,> with their chairman <,> their managing directors their financial advisors
then attorney to all see India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#108:1:B>
And they went back <,> with <,> nothing but <,> the most positive
and optimistic <?> reform </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#109:1:B>
It had to take time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#110:1:B>
When this recessional <,> the period of <O> one word </O> is much
longer <,> <{2> <[2> yeah <,> but <w> it's </w> happening

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#111:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#112:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#113:1:A>
Well I would have thought may be because there is a recession
<,,> uh British industries <,> and financial insitutions would be looking our
for other markets <,> and India

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#114:1:B>
Yeah they are <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#115:1:A>
India is the natural <,> massive market

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#116:1:A>
And we have <,> very weak advantage <,> as far as Britain is
concerned <,> that there is the <,> uh the language is not a barrier <,> we
know each other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#117:1:A>
In fact we still adopt their own standard <,> uh we have a <O> one
word </O> their judiciary the <O> one word </O> administration <,> therefore
everything is there very conducive for <,> uh increasing this

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#118:1:B>
Yes we <-> we and </-> two countries relate very closely to
each other <,> and that is very important <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#119:1:B>
This is tremendous awareness of the thing <,> that the India is a
natural ally <,> India ia a natural <,> country where to go for investments
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#120:1:B>
And this is a tremendous help <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#121:1:B>
I think during the recessionary phase also <,> the number of
approvals <,> applied for and granted <,,> or industries <O> one word </O> is
very large <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#122:1:B>
But <,,> so far as the economic <O> one word </O> is concerned <,>
it would have to take a little more time

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#123:1:B>
And we will have to <O> one word </O> here <,> a little more

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#124:1:B>
I have also hopes for <,> relocations of industries from Europe
<,> into India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#125:1:B>
I am certain that joint ventures between Britain and India would
be <,> a <,,> interesting reality in the world market <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#126:1:B>
We will do very well if we established these joint ventures for
the reasons you <,> just now mentioned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#127:1:B>
But I think <,,> you cannot <,,> merely add up <,,> during a short
period time play <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#128:1:B>
The <,,> results of what <w> we've </w> already achieved <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#129:1:B>
There is tremendous positiveness in the climate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#130:1:B>
It will take some time before we can uh <,> harvest the crops <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#131:1:B>
Which will come out of this uh <,,> <}> <-> <.> ma </.> </-> <=>
massive </=> </}> efforts that we have made <,> particularly in this <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#132:1:A>
Well the most important <,,> fact that is the question of the
climate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#133:1:A>
If it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation <,> of
good-will <,> of wanting to co-operate with each other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#134:1:A>
<w> There'll </w> be other <,> exchanges <,> follow automatically
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#135:1:A>
And I think it is in the interest of both <,> Britain and India
<,> that we <,> have a much closer understanding with each other <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#136:1:A>
Uh Europe is going in <,> uh for <,> unification

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#137:1:B>
Here <w> there'll </w> be problems <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-036#138:1:A>
But the unification of Europe <,> uh with Britain being <,> a
part of it will create <,> uh both problems <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#139:1:A>
And I think also opportunities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#140:1:A>
And <,> uh relations with Britain would play <,,> very major role
not only on the bi-lateral side <,> but also in regard to <w> India's </w>
co-operation and exchanges <,> with Europe <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#141:1:A>
At the same time I think that greater understanding <,> greater
objectivity <,> in the <O> a few words </O> these are the India and Pakistan
<,> is welcome and we see <,> much greater objectivity now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#142:1:A>
This is welcome <,> as such the visits of the Home Secretary and
the Prime Minister are going to be <,> extremely significant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#143:1:A>
Uh it is also worth noting <,> that even <,> three years ago one
would not have imagined <,> that the British Prime Minister <,> would be the
guest of honour at the Republic Day <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#144:1:A>
But he is going to be there <,> in nineteen ninety-three <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-036#145:1:A>
