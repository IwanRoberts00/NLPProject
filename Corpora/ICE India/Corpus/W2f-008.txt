SHORT STORY

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#2:1>
by Christine Krishnasami

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#3:1>
<h> <bold> Three Sisters </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> prestigious art gallery
was crowded, and stifling - - for me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#5:1>
For I have never cared much for all this la-di-da stuff. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#6:1>
I was always what you might call a science kid, and now a computer
analyst.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#7:1>
Hilda and I were school chums way back when in Siddapur, our
birthplace in Karnataka.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#8:1>
We pulled each <w> other's </w> pigtails and shared school lunches (
and secrets and giggles) for many a year at St. <w> Anne's </w> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#9:1>
On the first day, <w> I'd </w> been scared of the nuns habits and
run all the way home in tears and tantrums.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#10:1>
It had taken all the persuasion of two families to get me back in
that classroom. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#11:1>
I never did get used to the nuns and their ways, though they were
generally kind and the school was okay, I guess, better than many.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#12:1>
It was Hilda who took to the whole scene like a duckling to water.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#13:1>
Well-mannered compared with me, always first in English and Art,
lagging behind in Science, zero in Math.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#14:1>
We had swapped our budding talents back and forth between Art and
Science. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#15:1>
And now here I was, back from California on a visit because
Hilda was having a major exhibition at this fancy art gallery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#16:1>
<quote> " Hm," </quote> went one critic ( you can always tell a
critic ) in front of a canvas entitled <quote> " Harlot" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#17:1>
Harlot-ha, I thought to myself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#18:1>
The thing was a lot of dots and zigzag lines resembling nothing so
much as a desert at sunset time, maybe.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#19:1>
A patch of volcanic Arizona.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#20:1>
But the colours were real pretty, all fuschia and orange.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#21:1>
Shadows streaking over everything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#22:1>
<quote> " Harrumph!" </quote> went another critic as I moved on.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#23:1>
This time, the thing was called <quote> " Moon Mother," </quote> if
you please.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#24:1>
It seemed just like a large blank canvas to me, leastways from a
distance in flat daylight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#25:1>
But when cunningly placed lights shone on it from different angles (
and Hilda had arranged it so that the lighting changes were continuous ) ,
various shapes seemed to emerge, jump at you and recede.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#26:1>
Sort of female shapes, some like a tree or a vase.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#27:1>
In a scientific way, rather clever fo her, I thhought.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#28:1>
I like a vase anytime, especially white, painted in the old way with
lots of colourful flowers, green leaves and stems.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#29:1>
I like that, period. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#30:1>
So I pushed off to the rear of the gallery, away from all the
over-dressed, over-manicured crowd. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#31:1>
<quote> " What a lot of pother, Hilda!" </quote> I went tsk-tsk.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#32:1>
<quote> " I mean, the press, these darn critics, the fashionable
society, all this food and drink.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#33:1>
Was it really necessary?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#34:1>
<quote> " Blunt as usual, Mugger.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#35:1>
But see here, even if I were Cezanne come back to earth, <w> I'd </w>
have to sell myself like this on opening day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#36:1>
This is Bombay, remember?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#37:1>
Ol' Mugger.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#38:1>
How I had hated that nickname all through school <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#39:1>
Hilda and the others had always claimed it was right for me on
account of my disposition.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#40:1>
The name had stuck, along with the disposition.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#41:1>
<w> I'm </w> a different person in California, though. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#42:1>
<quote> " Oh, all right.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#43:1>
Anything I can do to help?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#44:1>
<quote> " Thanks, Mugger, but every<w> thing's </w> under
control.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#45:1>
Go back and be nice to the press if you will." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#46:1>
I was prevented from replying or complying by the arrival of one
of <w> Hilda's </w> fashionplate assistant. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#47:1>
<quote> " <w> Someone's </w> interested in Canvas No. 24, madam,"
</quote> she cooed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#48:1>
I went back with them out of curiosity.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#49:1>
A white-haired gentleman in a spotless ivory <indig> <it> khadi kurta
</it> </indig> and <indig> <it> churidar </it> </indig> outfit was regarding
No. 24 with studied casualness, but his eyes gave him away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#50:1>
I moved on, leaving the two to talk.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#51:1>
I noticed in passing that No. 24 was called <quote> " The clay pot."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#52:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> So </smallcaps> </bold> the day passed somehow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#53:1>
No one came near me except one ill-advised cub reporter who wanted
to know more about <w> Hilda's </w> background. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#54:1>
<quote> " Don't you know enough already from the others, young
man?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#55:1>
<quote> " Yes, madam.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#56:1>
But they told me you are her oldest and dearest friend so I
thought - - " </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#57:1>
<quote> " You thought nothing, kid.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#58:1>
And I know nothing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#59:1>
Now be a good boy and yamoose before I throw this in your sweet fresh
face.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#60:1>
But don't hold it against Mrs. Senai.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#61:1>
Not her fault <w> I'm </w> her oldest and dearest friend, okay?"
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#62:1>
I almost felt sorry when he backed away, upset a tray of snacks
and disappeared in the ensuing underplayed melee.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#63:1>
I hoped I hadn't spoiled a review or something.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#64:1>
Generally, the press ignored me and didn't hold me against Hilda.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#65:1>
Not that they could afford to - - <w> she'd </w> been a successful
and established artist for over a decade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#66:1>
So it came as no surprise that, by closing time, most of the <O>
drawing </O> canvases had been sold.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#67:1>
Only two were left, and by <w> Hilda's </w> choice.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#68:1>
I was glad for her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#69:1>
And putting up her feet while the simpering assistants and gallery
personnel went out to dinner, she settled down to a pizza with me and our
usual until-midnight-do-us-part shooting of the breeze.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#70:1>
And as usual, she waited for me to begin. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#71:1>
<quote> " That No.24," </quote> I said awkwardly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#72:1>
<quote> " One of the few what - - chamacallit representational
pieces.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#73:1>
Rather got to me." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#74:1>
The picture shows the balcony of the ugly highrise in Bombay
where Hilda Senai then lived with her husband and teenage son.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#75:1>
The railing of the balcony is coincident with the horizon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#76:1>
On the balcony, an eight-by-ten-inch portrait of <w> Hilda's </w>
mother is burning in a wide earthen pot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#77:1>
The young woman of the portrait has hair permed and waved in the
style of the thirties, eyes untouched by fate and lips about to smile ( Hilda
had inherited the eyes and smile ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#78:1>
The address of the photographer, a studio - - now long defunct
- - on <w> London's </w> Tottenham Court Road, is scrolled tastefully on
the bottom right-hand corner of the portrait.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#79:1>
High above the balcony railing hang galleons of snowy pacific Sunday
cloud ( some blues in between and some clear blue-fingered light piercing
through here and there ) with undersides of lilac shaded into violet, mystic
as all blues and purples are mystic, barely acknowledging the passage of yet
another day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#80:1>
Flames ring the young <w> woman's </w> face, licking at the
hair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#81:1>
The bright eyes will shortly turn to smoke.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#82:1>
Soon the bloom on the lips will be charcoal. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#83:1>
Framed in a mirror at a forty-five degree angle to the clay pot
is the face of Hilda around the same age, of wheaten complexion, weathered
somehow despite the seeming youth, unsmiling, eyes ringed dark. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#84:1>
<quote> " Yes, it got to me," </quote> I repeated, and waited
for Hilda to fill in the blanks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#85:1>
After all, it was Art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#86:1>
<quote> " That lovely photo was damaged, unfortunately,"
</quote> she responded.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#87:1>
<quote> " Like a lot of other scarred mementoes lying at the bottom
of a cracked valise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#88:1>
Generation of <quote> ` Waterloo Bridge' </quote> , <quote> `
Brief Encounter' </quote> and all those other songs and movies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#89:1>
Not compatible with crude jarring disco monotonies.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#90:1>
Nor meant for the indignity of a local garbage bin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#91:1>
So, from time to time, I let them all burn in that undated clay pot
saved from the Siddapur days.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#92:1>
Is there another way to dispose of them ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#93:1>
Anyway, if <w> I'd </w> known you liked this canvas, Mugger, I
wouldn't have sold it." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#94:1>
I waved a hand deprecatingly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#95:1>
<quote> " Thanks, ole gal, but <w> I've </w> a very nice picture of
your mom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#96:1>
The one I snapped just before we graduated from St. <w> Anne's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#97:1>
Your <indig> ma </indig> so happy and proud, one arm around you
protectively under that tamarind tree <*> dotted line</*> " </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#98:1>
And then I changed the subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#99:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> HOPE </smallcaps> </bold> Bootle had been an
unusual English girl from Kent who had had the audacity to marry an Indian
boy <w> she'd </w> met at the Universtiy of London, where she was into
Oriental Studies and he was - - as they say - - reading English ( those days,
people actually managed to get jobs after majoring in English Literature).

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#100:1>
They had met at the British Museum, <quote> " Hope Aunty" </quote>
had reminisced to me once, and were married months later at St. <w> Patrick's
</w> in Soho.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#101:1>
And returned to India just after 1945, having survived the blitz and
escaped the more gruesome events of the War. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#102:1>
But they didn't quite escape the social blitz in India, from
both British and Indian lines.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#103:1>
Hilda got born shortly after 1947, and the three of them had managed
to stick together right up to the sixties. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#104:1>
After we graduated from St. <w> Anne's </w> , Hilda and I had
gone our separate ways.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#105:1>
She went to the J.J. School of Art in Bombay and thence to Paris.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#106:1>
I ended up at the University of California, Irvine.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#107:1>
But we had never lost touch. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#108:1>
And that is how I had learned of the death of her parents in
1972 when the car they were travelling in was rammed by a speeding bus
somewhere between Siddapur and Mysore. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#109:1>
It had, too, been Hope Swamikannu who had saved Hilda from
becoming a nun like her teachers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#110:1>
Hilda had been all set to jump into that brown-and-black habit
after graduation but Hope had said, No, off you go to study Art like a good
girl. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#111:1>
But, Mother ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#112:1>
But nothing, my girl, you can always become a nun later, but not
right now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#113:1>
We had all cheered when Hilda went off to Bombay in a spanking
new dress, all white and buttercup yellow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#114:1>
I held Aunty <w> Hope's </w> hand in a manner of speaking while <w>
Hilda's </w> things were put away in storage.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#115:1>
And then I, too, left.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#116:1>
The two families supported each other through all of the social
ostracism that followed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#117:1>
Those days, girls didn't go traipsing off alone for higher studies.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#118:1>
<quote> " Shan't ask about that post-Expressionist doodad -
- or is it post-Minimalist - - but this other canvas here.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#119:1>
Why, you <w> could've </w> called the shots on this one !

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#120:1>
Everybody, but everybody was admiring it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#121:1>
A hundred grand, maybe ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#122:1>
And you didn't want to sell?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#123:1>
<quote> " Of course not.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#124:1>
This canvas is for you, Mugger.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#125:1>
Don't pretend you can't stand it, for I caught you sneaking a look
at it whenever all those people let you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#126:1>
And don't you pretend you don't know why.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#127:1>
Worth it, isn't it?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#128:1>
My throat had seized up, so I got up and poured us the last of
the wine.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#130:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> It </smallcaps> </bold> remains a very special
canvas.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#131:1>
Three nuns are dying in a <w> visitors' </w> parlour converted into
a sick bay because outsiders wouldn't be allowed inside the cloisters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#132:1>
The oldest nun, past eighty, is prone on a sickbed shown
diagonally at stage right.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#133:1>
Skin like tallow, eyes closed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#134:1>
The second nun, in her fifties, is seated by the bedside towards the
centre of the canvas and regards the viewer directly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#135:1>
The starched white wimple intensifies the dark hue of her
complexion, but you can still make out the faint line of a moustache and a
wart or two on one cheek. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#136:1>
The third and youngest nun, thirty something, is seated at an
angle away from the other two at stage left.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#137:1>
Elegantly straight, with hands folded behind the scapular in the
seemly way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#138:1>
Behind the thick ugly frames of the spectacles, unlined
almondshaped eyes look away into some distance over your right
shoulder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#139:1>
The mouths of the three nuns are open slightly, almost
smilingly, in a sol-fa expression.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#140:1>
In intense pain, all three, but of course the eyes don't betray an
inkling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#141:1>
They remain calm and contained, and yet you know <w> they're </w>
dying - - don't ask me how.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#142:1>
Sort of like a poet making you understand something vast and
significant, personal and yet transcendent, and not in so many words, either.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-008#143:1>
A canvas over which everybody still goes gaga.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#144:1>
An arpeggio in black, brown, grey, white, buff and hues of mauve,
blue, violet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#145:1>
Contemplative and still but with movement in stillness and music in
the silence, like a chant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#146:1>
Solemnity of old Latin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#147:1>
A patina.

<ICE-IND:W2F-008#148:1>
Even I can see it, feel it. </p>
