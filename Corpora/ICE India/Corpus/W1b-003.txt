I came to your house to meet you but unfortunately, nobody was at
home, I was told.

<ICE-IND:W1B-003#135:2>
I have been doing the work very seriously and sincerely.

<ICE-IND:W1B-003#148:2>
It would be very kind of you if you let me know your present phone
number because the phone numbers in Kolhapur have been changed.

<ICE-IND:W1B-003#149:2>
