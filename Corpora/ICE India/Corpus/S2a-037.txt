Uh prof Deshpande <,,> the coordinator for <,,> this particular  
course in English of the <,> Academic Staff college Marathawada University  
<,> prof Shastri visiting professor here <,> and my friends <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#2:1:A>
Professor Deshpande of course <,> uh was attempting to <,> apply  
cosmetics <,,> to many of the short comings that I possess <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#3:1:A>
And he was praising many of the things which I don't deserve <,> to  
the power of yen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#4:1:A>
So <w> you've </w> got to take everything that he says with a <,,>  
pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#5:1:A>
Uh having said that <,,> uh God only knows how <,> desperately <,,>  
I wanted to become <,> what uh the standard coach <,> of the Marathwada  
University <,> says as a <,> non-teaching employee of a non- Agricultural  
University <,,> <O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#6:1:A>
So <,> <w> that's </w> what I wanted to become <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#7:1:A>
And uh <,> unfortunately <,,> various development took place <,> and  
uh as a consequence I am here <,> trying to discuss things with you share  
some of my thoughts with you <,> so <w> that's </w> the background <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#8:1:A>
But anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure <,> to meet many of my old  
students and old friends in this congregation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#9:1:A>
Although I had initially promised to <,> uh lecture to you <,,> of a  
<,> seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors I am  
unable to <,> meet you for this uh <,> duration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#10:1:A>
But I think I am going to think of it <,> what I would have  
normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#11:1:A>
I am going to cover <,> most of the things <,> in these two  
lectures 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#12:1:A>
The first topic <,> would be on <,> the Broad Fields and <,>  
Conventions in American Literature <,> and it would be followed up <,> by the  
various Fictual concepts <,> that are employed in any discussion of American  
literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#13:1:A>
Now <,,> to start with let me <,> establish a <,> comparative frame  
of uh <,> reference <,> between Indian writing in English <,> and American  
literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#14:1:A>
I fondly recall <,> that both these topics were introduced at my  
old Alma mater Andhra University way back in the year nineteen hundred and  
sixty-two <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#15:1:A>
That was the year when <,> one of the earliest of <O> one word </O>  
scholar <,> to have collected a degree in the United States of America  
professor Raghavacharalu had come back with a Ph D from the University of  
Pennsylvenia <,> and my old teacher <,> professor Shrinivas Iyengar <,> had  
uh <,> written a pioneering book <,> on Indian writing in English 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#16:1:A>
So these two streams <,> came to a head and we were very fortunate  
to be <,> students and that was the year when I graduated and <,> I wanted to  
pursue <,> my research 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#17:1:A>
But uh <,> in the department itself there was a good deal of  
discussion <,> about Indian writing in English 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#18:1:A>
Even the topic itself <,> had become controversial debatable <,>  
they were toying with the idea of <,> employing the term Indian English  
writing or uh <,> Indo- Anglican or Anglian uh <,> writing and ultimately  
Iyengar thought that Indian writing in English <,> would be broadly <,>  
descriptive and proper 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#19:1:A>
And Raghavacharlu introduced American literature 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#20:1:A>
So we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed  
to these two <,> streams <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#21:1:A>
And surprisingly we also had the <,> a sort of exhibition <,> every  
fourth year <,> the University organises an exhibition <w> it's </w> so easy  
for <,> people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their  
technological wonder and innovation 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#22:1:A>
But then <,> for students of literature what can they do <,> so  
what we had done was to <,> graphically visually represent <,> various aspect  
of American literature <,> Indian writing in English and we had drawn various  
charts <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#23:1:A>
And <,> I still remember <,> uh we drew a X axis and a Y axis <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#24:1:A>
And there was a confluence of influence <,> between the political  
happenings and <,> the <}> <-> <.> li </.> </-> <=> literary </=> </}>  
development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#25:1:A>
A crucial periods of time <,> remarkable text was produced that was  
the end result of our own <,> research 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#26:1:A>
I wish I had kept an old copy of uh that visual display <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#27:1:A>
And one would notice that in many respects <,> the <,> development  
and the growth of Indian writing in English <,> and that of <,> American  
literature seems to have taken <,> a broad pattern <,> a particular  
configuration which is comparable <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#28:1:A>
And uh <,> if you go to the beginning <,,> you would notice that uh  
<,> the elements of Indian writing in English <,> were triggered off <,> they  
were given the necessary <,> <O> one word </O> mainly because of the famous  
minutes <,> of Lord Macaulay in the year eighten hundred and thirty-five <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#29:1:A>
And uh <,> if you are student of American literure <,> you would  
notice that uh <,> we normally divide American literature into <,> the usable  
path <,> and the <,> the vibrant American literature <,> which uh <,>  
acquired a particular <,> shape and a dimension <,> in the year eighteen  
hundred and thirty <,> particularly when uh <,> uh Emerson <,> delivered that  
famous <,> speech <,> addressed the Phi Betta Kappa association of Howard <,>  
even it is cool <,> the <,> speech which is <O> one word </O> on <,> uh which  
was later on come to be known as American <,> scholar <,> speech 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#30:1:A>
And now a days everybody come to this <,> this particular speech  
delivered by <,> Emerson as uh <,> the literary declaration of independence  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#31:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> the importance that they give 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#32:1:A>
So <,> one notices that uh <,> in terms of uh <,> the time sequence  
<,> the growth and uh progress <,> <w> they're </w> comparable although  
America was <,> discovered technically within course because we are  
celebrating <,> the quincentenary year of <,> the discovery of America 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#33:1:A>
Columbus <,> reached the shores of America in the year <,> fourteen  
hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh <,> August and uh <,>  
precisely on August sixth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#34:1:A>
And uh <,> you know the <,> basic thing he was in search of a  
passage to India <,> and then he discovered a passage to the <,> new world  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#35:1:A>
And uh <,> in the initial stages of course most of <,> the  
literature was in the <,> nature <,> of uh letters addressed to relatives  
friends back home <,> in Portugal and in Spain because he was commissioned by  
King Ferdinand to undertake this uh <,> trip 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#36:1:A>
And uh <,> this sort of a epistolary exercise <,> formed the source  
of American literature but uh <,> most patriot Americans would like to claim  
<,> that uh <,> even the name of the person who discovered America had been  
rather Portugal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#37:1:A>
His name is Christopher Columbus <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#38:1:A>
Christopher meaning Christ bearer <,> Columbus meaning the person  
who illuminates column <,> <w> that's </w> the unit which measures <,> light 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#39:1:A>
So this is symbolically <,> speaking Christopher Columbus  
discovering America <,,> established the influence of light over <,> the  
forces of darkness <w> that's </w> how they symbolically tried to explain <,>  
the significance of Columbus discovering America <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#40:1:A>
And uh the <,> later immigration took place in the early part of  
the seventeenth century <,> uh particularly with <,> the <,,> myth lover <,>  
compact <,> and uh <,> the pilgrims <,> landing on the Plymoth rock <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#41:1:A>
Apart from various jokes that are bandit about <,> one of the joke  
says that uh <,> instead of the Pilgrim father landing on the <,> uh Plymouth  
rock if the Plymouth were to land on the pilgrims <O> one word </O> <,> uh  
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of  
Indians in America <,> not to speak of the genocide that was committed in  
Vietnam etcetera etcetera 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#42:1:A>
Atleast the ugly Americans <,> would have been saved the image of  
the ugly <,> Americans 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#43:1:A>
So apart from these things one uh <,> has a <,> perception about  
the influence of religion <,> uh in so far as the American writing is uh  
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception <,>  
religious differences the interness and battles particularly between <,> the  
Puritans and the Anglicans <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#44:1:A>
In England <w> it's </w> <,> <O> one word </O> over and uh <,> the  
immigration to America took place and <,> the initial writing was broadly  
conditioned by these uh <,> denominational cause <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#45:1:A>
Uh the Calvanistic street became very very important <,> and as a  
consequence of this <O> one word </O> Calvanistic street 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#46:1:A>
They <,> thought that <,> the founding of America was a new  
opportunity for mankind <w> it's </w> uh <,> Europe had become totally  
corrupt and <,> therefore people are saying what is happening in Bosnia <,>  
and Herzegovina <,> and Sarajevo which <,> gave rise to the first world war  
because uh <,> Archduke Ferdinand was killed and uh <,> that released various  
forces which resulted in <,> the beginning of the First World War 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#47:1:A>
And people are worried <,> that <O> one word </O> ethnic strife  
would spread all over Europe and who knows <,> the Third World War might  
start from this particular cockpit <,> in Europe 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#48:1:A>
Now <,,> the root of uh the migration towards America <,> uh  
refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over Europe  
between the Anglicans <,> who were one variety of uh Catholics and this  
Puritans 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#49:1:A>
And uh <,> they believed in the Calvanistic dictum <,> of <}> <->  
<.> determin </.> </-> <=> determinism </=> </}> <,> and all these things  
they percolated into the general psyche of uh <,> the American immigrant  
there 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#50:1:A>
And initial literature <,> in America is conditioned by <,> uh this  
sort of a <,> uhm shall we say <,> denominational and uh <,> religious <,>  
conflict and strife <,> okay 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#51:1:A>
We have uh <,> various Calvanist fighting it out <,> to establish  
mainly because they thought that uh <,> uhm the discovery of America opened  
up possibilities <,> of man going back to the condition of the pre <O> one  
word </O> had <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#52:1:A>
Because uh after <,> the saviour redeemed mankind <,> over a period  
of time man has succumbed to evil forces <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#53:1:A>
Wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#54:1:A>
Man is corrupt and whatever he touches <,> is corrupted 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#55:1:A>
So this was the broad belief <,> and uh <,> instead of the new  
Maseih <,,> America itself provided <,> the image of the new garden of Eden  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#56:1:A>
After uh Jesus <,> got back the Paradise that was lost because of  
stone passion crusification and sacrifice <,> here was another great  
opportunity so they wanted to transform America into a new <,> garden of Eden 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#57:1:A>
So this was the bold <,> possibilities that they envisaged <,> in  
America they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#58:1:A>
So all the literature reflect the search of perception <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#59:1:A>
A new opportunity and with an advance fall with <O> two words </O>  
until a greater man redeemed us <,> but even the sacrifice <}> <- > of <.>  
Jes </.> </-> <=> of Jesus </=> </}> has not helped us 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#60:1:A>
Now <,> they thought that America is going to provide another  
opportunity for the redemption of mankind 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#61:1:A>
So <,> generally one notices this sort of a reflection <,> in the  
early American literture 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#62:1:A>
Now <,,> thereafter one notices that uh <,> we had the  
transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm <,>  
Thoreau and uh <,> Emerson <,> but the speech that I was refering to <,,>  
becomes a very crucial part of <,> the growth and development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#63:1:A>
And one notices that after eighteen thirty <,,> American literature  
<,> acquired a new vibrancy of its own <,> where people like Whitman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#64:1:A>
Whitman was not trying to immitate <,> the Romantic poets <,> he  
had established a native idiom <,> and his rhetoric was filled with the  
ringing world <,> that the Americans had employed 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#65:1:A>
And it was transmiter <,> but then it represented the new  
democratic <,> America <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#66:1:A>
So this is reflected in the <mention> Leaves of Grass </mention>  
<,> and in the Poetry of uh <,> Whitman 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#67:1:A>
I mean as though <,> it appears as though Whitman was just waiting  
for somebody <,> to give the green signal <,> so that uh <,> he could publish  
all his poetry <,> without much of uh <,> <?> innovation </?> and uh <,>  
there also one notices that the contemporary <,,> of uh <,> Whitman  
particularly Hawthorne <,> and Melville <,> because of their <,> deep study  
of Elizabethan literature the Renaissance <,> period they started uh <,>  
writing a particular variety of English employed many of their literary  
devices <,> which uh had become important in the whole world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#68:1:A>
They were still tied to the apron string <,,> of most of the  
English <,> writer 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#69:1:A>
But the great <,> divide occurs when it comes to Walt uh <,> Mark  
Twain 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#70:1:A>
<w> That's </w> why <,,> one normally says that Mark Twain is the  
Lincoln <,> of American literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#71:1:A>
We have uh <,> a conferable frame of reference between what  
happened in politics <,> and what happens in literature here 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#72:1:A>
I wanted to <,> notice that one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#73:1:A>
If anybody has seen the picture of uh <,> Washington <,> the first  
president of the United States of America <,> Washington is modelled after  
the classical pattern 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#74:1:A>
He looks like one of those great Roman Senators wearing a show  
guard <,> and even the face is so impressive <,> as though it is chiselled in  
marble <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#75:1:A>
But when you come to Lincoln <,> by no stretch of imagination would  
one call Lincoln <,> a person built on the classical mode 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#76:1:A>
He had <,> none of the Gracian <,> features <,> he was uh <,>  
homespun <,> and homely and <,> but then there was a certain dignity 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#77:1:A>
<w> It's </w> like the writings of <,> Melville <,,> and the  
writings of Mark Twain <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#78:1:A>
So <,> even in politics one notices that the <,> balance of power  
<,> to use a jaded expression had shifted <,> from the tide water region of  
America that is the east coast <,> the Applachian mountains and the <,> the  
New England region to the interior of America the river <,> the Mississippi  
Missouri river 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#79:1:A>
So <,,> Lincoln came from Ohio 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#80:1:A>
He spent most of his time <,> in that particular region the heart  
of uh <,> America 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#81:1:A>
Whereas <,> the earlier presidents <,> they came from the old  
aristocratic patricians families of Virginia or <,> New York 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#82:1:A>
So in political terms balance of power has shifted from <,> the New  
England region to the heart of <,> America 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#83:1:A>
America was still expanding westward California had to be populated  
<,> the gold rush had to take place later on <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#84:1:A>
The so called resting movement had not taken place by that time  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#85:1:A>
And uh <,> one notices that Lincoln <,> became the president  
possibly the most important president <,> in the United States of America who  
<,> brought about lots of changes and the civil war took place and uh <,>  
emancipation of the Negros also <,> took place 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#86:1:A>
So all these things gave rise to <,> a particular culture that was  
rooted in <,> the <,> uhm genius of the people <,> the indigenous genius of  
the Americans <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#87:1:A>
So in literature and in politics this sort of a influence <,> is uh  
discernable 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#88:1:A>
And uh <,> one would notice <,> a similar thing happening because I  
started uh <,> refering to Indian writing in English when you come to <,> our  
own uh uh literature that is written in English <,> one notices that uh <,>  
after <w> Macaulay's </w> <,> Minute <,,> particularly in Bengal I have been  
pressing this thesis I don't know whether <,> uh <w> it's </w> acceptable or  
whether it is well received or not <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#89:1:A>
In <,> Bengal <,> which is one of the oldest <,> provinces of the  
British Raj <,> one notices that <,> there is a <,> simultaneous movement of  
uh what I call as uh <,> both the Reformation and the Renaissance <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#90:1:A>
Renaissance in literature <,> Reformation in <,> religious aspects  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#91:1:A>
Mainly because uh people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy <,> and the other  
<,> who are acutely conscious of the decadent aspects of Hinduism <,>  
consciously they thought many of the good things from Christianity and from  
various other religious sources <,> in order to bring about meaningful  
transformation of Hinduism <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#92:1:A>
What were the uhm <,> inseparable <,> uh inadequacies of Hinduism  
<,> <indig> Sati </indig> child marriages and <,> various other irrational  
forms of worship 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#93:1:A>
So <,> one notices that uh <,> this sort of a <,> revival of  
interest in the ancient glories <,> coupled with the conscious approach <,>  
to bring about Reformation took place there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#94:1:A>
Initially many of them underwent conversion to Christianity 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#95:1:A>
But then <,> they wanted to retain what ever was <,> residuely good  
<,> in Hinduism <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#96:1:A>
And as a concequence they started a movement known as the <mention>  
Brahmo Samaj </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#97:1:A>
There are three movements which could be considered as <,> part of  
our own reformation <,> <mention> Brahmo Samaj </mention> in Bengal <,>  
<mention> Arya Samaj </mention> <,> in erstwhile Punjab undivided Punjab <,>  
<mention> Prarthana Samaj </mention> based in Pune <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#98:1:A>
So these <,> I mean <w> I'll </w> speak Tilak Ranade Gokhale  
etcetera were all <,> associated with the <mention> Prarthana Samaj  
</mention> based in <,> Pune 

<ICE-IND:S2A-037#99:1:A>
So they were acutely conscious of uh <,> various <,> defeciency <,>  
in Hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion <,> and of  
course later on <,> we had people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa although he was  
totally illiterate <,> many of the things that he spoke <,> were Christ like  
<,,> </I>
