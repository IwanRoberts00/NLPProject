Dear Friend, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-004#4:1>
Dr. B.T. Desai has raised a point regarding the
scrutiny of the  
papers. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-004#5:1>
This is to make it clear to all that by scrutiny we
only meant  
noticing any minor thing which might have escaped the <w>
author's </w> eye  
and getting that clarified / revised. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-004#6:1>
We do not wish to eliminate any of the papers. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-004#7:1>
We are all Prof. Dr. <w> Nadkarni's </w> students who
care for quality. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-004#8:1>
I hope this clarifies the point if anyone else had a
similar doubt. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-004#9:1>
With best regards

bus-stand and  
is well-known to all the cycle rikshaw pullers and

It is close to the main Ashram building and also to
the Ashram dining  
room, where we will be taking our meals. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-004#56:2>

arrangements made.
