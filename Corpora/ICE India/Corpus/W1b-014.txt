My dear Dheeranmama, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#4:1>
There must be something in the air on this 30th day
of Aug. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#5:1>
If you know something about these things please check
and let me know. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#6:1>
Because, this is the third letter of the day that I am
writing and  
Sulbha is too stunned for words. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#7:1>
I often wonder why I have stopped writing letters - -
something I used  
to enjoy once upon a time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#8:1>
Possibly, it is the general trend of self <}> <->
centeredness to  
which I have also started conforming. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#9:1>
You know, it has been one month since Samar left for
Dehra Dun and I  
have written my first letter to him! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#10:1>
No, I am not too busy. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#11:1>
Although enough activity takes place the whole day, I
have got used  
to the job and it takes me only a few minutes to decide how to
go about  
handling even tricky situations. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#12:1>
Sometimes, I think a person with an average IQ can
practically do any  
job including running this country. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#13:1>
I know you are bound to say that is the easiest of the
jobs these  
days as even historians <del> give </del> make allowances for
short tenures  
and so there is no bother of accountability etc.. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#14:1>
Jokes apart, tell me how have you been keeping. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#15:1>
<}> <-> Health wise, </-> <+> Healthwise, </+> </}> I
am sure you  
take eough care. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#16:1>
But how about your worrisome habit? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#17:1>
How it <del> been </del> worsened with the general
deterioration all  
around? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#18:1>
I hope not because I am afraid <O> on the same
letterhead above </O>  
there is not much one can do about those things and it is
better to be laid  
back and keep <del> things </del> cool under the
circumstances. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#19:1>
We are fairly insulated in the campus life. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#20:1>
Despite this, we can see the changes coming in quite
rapidly at both  
the junior and senior levels. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#21:1>
Recently, my Boss a non-manipulating, idealstic
Maharashtrian has had  
to bear the brunt of these changes. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#22:1>
I often find myself vacillating and at times updating
my value system  
in such times. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#23:1>
I call it updating because I don't like to use the
word <quote> `  
degradation' </quote> for the fear of it being true. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#24:1>
How I wish you were here and we could have had some
long chats. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#25:1>
That is definitely an invitation and I hope you will
be bold enough  
to take it up sometime soon. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#26:1>
The social life is quite OK. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#27:1>
It is a compact place with lots of greenery and the
ever screaming  
sound of the jets of various size and colour. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#28:1>
Aman keeps us busy, amused and an eternal source of
wonder <del> with  
</del> because of his penchant for profound statements and the
way he looks  
at life at such an young age. </p>

My dear Dheeranmama, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#34:1>
Thank you for your letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#35:1>
I received it just the day I was leaving for this
place. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#36:1>
The name of the place sounds like it is from some part
of the African  
Continent isn't it? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#37:1>
There was an aircraft accident in which the pilot
EJECTED due to  
engine trouble and I am playing the Sherlock Holmes. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#38:1>
No clues so far but once the engine gets examined
thoroughly at  
Kanpur it might just turn out to be <quote> ` Elementary! Mr
Watson'</quote>. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#39:1>
I have been fairly busy; especially compared with
the lifestyle  
of College of Airwarfare at Secundarabad. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#40:1>
Till end of July it was hectic, as I had to cope with
the quantum of  
work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#41:1>
Anyway, I do find time to enjoy myself and watch TV
once in a way. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#42:1>
This post has taught me how to handle multifarious
jobs and also how to deal with stress. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#43:1>
I have realised that it is not possible or rather it
is  
counterproductive to believe perfection <del> which </del> in
fields that do  
not <del> deserve to be perfect </del> merit perfection. Also
to put it in a  
<w> pilot's </w> language, it is better to work at 95 % RPM
<del> wh </del> (  
Revolutions per Minute of the engine ) than to work at full
throstle and burn oneself out in the bargain. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#44:1>
You wont believe this - - I even tried <del> out some
</del> to learn  
classical singing from a local music teacher, as a form of
relaxation. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#45:1>
<del> In </del> Typical of me, I didn't pursue becasue
I <del> fr </del> told <del> me ? </del> him to get on to
<indig> Malkauns </indig> ( my  
favourite ) at the earliest and I could see he was most
reluctant to do so. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#46:1>
All in all, I do believe life is a continuous process
of learning and  
I do hope you will notice some change in my attitudes next
time we meet. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#47:1>
I just read what I wrote to check back if I was
making any sense  
or simply rambling along and confusing you with my convoluted
sentences. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#48:1>
It seems OK except that I wonder why my typical
Scorpio trait of  
keeping my thoughts to myself doesn't work out while writing
to you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#49:1>
Some chemistry I suppose! </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#50:1>
I was glad to read that you are able to walk
around and also  
managed the Bombay trip without any problems. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#51:1>
I wonder if you would care to visit us ( health
permitting ) at Kalaikenda. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#52:1>
Nothing would please me more than having you and
<indig> Mami </indig> with us for a month or so. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#53:1>
Do write if that is possible. </p>

Samar has stabilised at the Doon School and the
younger one at the Airforce School. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#55:1>
I once again invite you to our place and genuinely
feel that a  
change of place and environment would brighten up the
otherwise monotonous  
and routine life we all have to <del> life </del> live. </p>

Dear Appa, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#60:2>
You are not aware of the extent of tension I was
under when I was in Bombay for that one day. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#61:2>
I did not have a single original <}> <-> document </->
<+> documents  
</+> </}> with me at that very moment which were so badly
required for joining the ship. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#62:2>
But as it happened that they were also equally <del>
in </del> ( badly) in need of my joining so somehow they
managed to put me on to the ship. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#63:2>
My original Panamian documents were lost in the post (
or rather  
delayed) which I had posted to them from UK. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#64:2>
Fortunately they wre delivered safely after 25 days (
SWIFT-MAIL! )  
but it was too late. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#65:2>
That is why they asked for my photographs at the
11<sp>th</sp> hour. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#66:2>
Secondly I had applied for <mention> Dangerous goods
</mention>  
endorsement in UK on my UK liscence which also took some time
to process. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#67:2>
Rajashree received them only last week. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#68:2>
Things are looking up it seems now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#69:2>
My written exams results are expected anytime next
week & Rajashree  
is frantically trying to join me tomorrow. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#70:2>
Let us see what happens. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#71:2>
<w> I'm </w> also upset & dishartened over your
decision over  
shifting to Kolhapur once again. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#72:2>
You know, somehow I feel a sense of security when you
are there nearby. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#73:2>
That is why I insisted that you shift to Pune
alongwith us. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#74:2>
I still need you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#75:2>
Then, when I look at your side & think, I feel you are
better off in  
Kolhapur in the sense, you have all the infrastructure set up
for your  
project there, your assistant & Mr. Gosavi are all there to
help you complete your peoject. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#76:2>
<indig> Amma </indig> too feels <ul> at home </ul>
when she is in Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#77:2>
<w> That's </w> how I convince myself over your
decision. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#78:2>
I will look forward to the day when you shall return
to Pune & I will  
give you all the luxuries & <del> your needs </del> look after
your needs &  
never ever give you a chance to complain again. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#79:2>
<w> I'm </w> <del> p </del> coming back home in
Jan / Feb ' 99 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#80:2>
Meanwhile <w> I'm </w> sending you a cheque of Rs.
20,000/-. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#81:2>
You can use it whenever necessary or you may save it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#82:2>
But <w> I've </w> decided that I will keep sending you
some money  
regularly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#83:2>
<w> I'm </w> very poor at managing money ( That is
what <w> I've </w>  
realised ) & am not able to save enough 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#84:2>
But whenever I earn, <w> I'm </w> going to send you a
part of it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#85:2>
<w> I've </w> sent Sept allotment to my bank which is
expected to be  
credited in my Account in the 2<sp>nd</sp> week of Sept. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#86:2>
Hope you should get this letter by the same time. </p>

 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#87:2>
Nothing more to pen. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#88:2>

Trust this letter finds you & Amma in a festive
mood. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#94:3>
<w> We're </w> back at Rastanura in Saudi Arabia
for loading of  
liquified petroleum gas & shall sail back to Japan for
discharging of cargo (  
LPG). 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#95:3>
This place - - Rastanura is in close proximity to
Dubai,  
approximately 3 hrs drive to the downtown, so repatriation
becomes  
convenient. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#96:3>
As we normally don't berth here; I had to board the
ship in the mid  
sea on the 1<sp>st</sp> of sept. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#97:3>
My flight from Bombay to Dubai <foreign> en route
<foreign>  
Muscut was quite comfortable. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#98:3>
I was issued business class ticket right upto Dubai. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#99:3>
We managed to get a window seat very close to the
cockpit. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#100:3>
Kuku could see Aeroplanes <}> <-> taxing </-> <+>
taxiing </+> </}>  
on the runway & was excited about it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#101:3>
On arrival at Dubai airport I called up <w> Deepa's
</w> <}> <->  
sis-inlaw </-> <+> sister-in-law </+> </}> - - Roli, only
hoping that her  
telephone no. hadn't changed as I couldn't <}> <-> preintimate

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#102:3>
Like Deepa, she too is an Engineering graduate, <del>
K </del>  
working with Compaq computers & her husband Anurag Saxena is a
big shot in  
Dubai with an <w> IIM's </w> MBA degree, to his credit. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#103:3>
I was <}> <-> overhelmed </-> <+> overwhelmed </+>
</}> with their  
hospitality & jovial, down-to-earth nature. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#104:3>
Despite <}> <-> their </-> <+> his </+> </}> busy
schedules he took  
a day off at his office & drove me around almost everywhere. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#105:3>
They also showed me the spots where Zee TV serial
<indig> <quote> `  
DASTAAN' </quote> </indig> was shot. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#106:3>
Except for the soaring temperature, Dubai is indeed
an amazing place  
especially the shopping malls & amusement parks. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#107:3>
We also visited some <del> autheti </del> authentic
<del> soud  
</del> South Indian Restaurants. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#108:3>
Where I packed <indig> Idli, Chutney & sambhar
</indig> from Kamat  
for Raju before boarding the ship! </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#109:3>
I was really in need of a change of place so on
an impulse I  
complied with the <w> company's </w> request of me flying
along with Kuku on  
such a short notice. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#110:3>
Moreover I was longing to stay with Raju as well. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#111:3>
Anyway it turned out to be a good decision. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#112:3>
<w> It's </w> very sad to know that your prostate
pain hasn't  
subsided as yet. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#113:3>
Hope it doesn't hamper your project work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#114:3>
Anyway don't overexert yourself. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#115:3>
I guess you must have already consulted Dr. Punjoni.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#116:3>
<w> Raju's </w> work has eased out a bit. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#117:3>
Last month he was working for almost 15 hrs a day!
owing to a  
technical snag in Engine followed by 40 <}> <-> tonns </-> <+>
tonnes </+>  
</}> of fuel oil spillage on the deck during bunkering. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#118:3>
A Norwegian Inspector was a witness to this
catastrophe; he was  
sailing with us upto Japan. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#119:3>
He held Chief Engg & 4<sp>th</sp> Engg responsible
for it & both  
were sacked. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#120:3>
Now that everything is back to normal, Raju is
relaxed & carrying  
out with his routine work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#121:3>
Invariably I & Kuku are with him in the Engine
Control Room. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#122:3>
Kuku has become an expert seafarer. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#123:3>
He does his homework regularly; I don't have to
pester him to open  
his hooks. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#124:3>
As far as his food is concerned, <w> he's </w> not
fussy about  
anything. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#125:3>
( His diet comprises of milk, eggs, fruits & bread )
. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#126:3>
However I feel he misses <indig> chappattis </indig>
& <indig> `  
bhaji' </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#127:3>
Of course he misses you both <}> <-> alot </-> <+> a
lot </+> </}>  
especially when he is studying he remembers his <indig> `
Ajja' </indig>. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#128:3>
We both were shocked to know about the sad demise
of <indig>  
sou. </indig> Avvi. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#129:3>
Raju remembered here as a matured & gentle elder
sister. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-014#130:3>
He wrote to Vithal at his Hubli address. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-014#131:3>
Nothing more to pen.
