<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#4:1>
It is believed that there is no single natural pH of precipitation
applicable to the whole globe, but rather several natural values, each unique
to a region the size of a continent or an ocean.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#5:1>
Hence, the natural pH of rain water in rural areas in India will
also depend upon the geographical location of the observational site.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#6:1>
The dust load in the atmosphere over the northwest parts of India is
significantly higher than that over the eastern parts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#7:1>
It is reported that the dust particles are potentially basic in nature
which can neutralize the H ion concentration and maintain the pH in the
alkaline range.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#8:1>
However, the extent to which the air-borne dust influences the
chemistry of rain water in certain geographical regions varies with its
composition and abundance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#9:1>
In view of the above, the rain water samples were collected at two
rural locations namely, <mention> Muktsar </mention> in Punjab ( NW India )
and <mention> Goraur </mention> in Bihar ( NE India ) where there is a
significant difference in the concentrations ot total suspended
particulates.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#10:1>
The rain water samples, collected simultaneously during the monsoon
season of 1988, were analysed for major cations and anions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#11:1>
The influence of individual ions on pH of rain water has been
identified and the reasons for the variations in pH at the two locations
are discussed. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#12:1>
<h> <bold> SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#13:1>
Rain water samples were collected at two locations namely,
Muktsar and Goraur during the monsoon season of 1988.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#14:1>
Samples were collected by using stainless steel funnels of 30 cm
diameter fitted on 10 lit capacity polyethylene bottles previously rinsed
with double distilled water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#15:1>
The duration of each sample was 24 h.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#16:1>
The funnels were washed twice daily in the morning and evening to
avoid dry deposition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#17:1>
However, contamination due to dry deposition cannot be completely
ruled out.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#18:1>
The two sampling locations are representative of rural
environments since there are no local pollution sources.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#19:1>
All rain water samples were filtered through Whatman - - 41 filter
paper and refrigerated at 4<*>degrees</*>C in laboratory until all the ionic
components were analysed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#20:1>
The samples were analysed for major anions ( CI, SO<sb>4</sb> and
NO<sb>3</sb> ) and cation ( NH<sb>4</sb>, Na, K, Ca and Mg ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#21:1>
The concentrations of CI, SO<sb>4</sb>, NO<sb>4</sb>, and
NH<sb>4</sb> were determined by using standard colorimetric methods (
Khemani <it> et al., </it> 1985 ) , and those of metallic components by using
atomic absorption spectrophotometer ( Perkin-Elmer, model 373 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#22:1>
Also, the pH was measured with a digital pH meter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#23:1>
The pH data in the present study are interpreted in the light of
CO<sb>2</sb> - - equilibrated value ( pH = 6.65 ) , though it may not be a
real atmospheric background value. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#26:1>
The average seasonal concentrations in mg / l of major anions
and cations along with pH values in the rain water collected at the two
locations are given in table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#27:1>
As the measurements include the major anions and cations, their ratio
value should be 1.0.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#28:1>
But it varied from 0.84 to 1.20 at <mention> Muktsar </mention> and
from 0.80 to 1.4 at <mention> Goraur </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#29:1>
The possible reasons for such deviations have been mentioned by
Munger ( 1982 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#30:1>
The total mineralization in rain water at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> was 18.52 mg / l, whereas at Goraur it was only 5.67 mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#31:1>
The high mineralization at <mention> Muktsar </mention> was mainly
due to high concentration of cations, especially Ca, which is mostly
originated from oil.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#32:1>
The high concentration of sea salt ( Na and Cl ) at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> is puzzling and requires explanation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#33:1>
It is suggested that the excess sea salt at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> might be transported from the <mention> Loni salt basin </mention>
, situated upwind in Rajasthan, by the prevailing south westerly winds
during the monsoon season.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#34:1>
Ca and NO<sb>3</sb> the dominant ions in the rain water at <mention>
Muktsar </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#35:1>
But <mention> Goraur </mention> , the dominant ions were Ca and
SO<sb>4</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#36:1>
SO<sb>4</sb> and NO<sb>3</sb> in atmosphere are mostly released from
the <O> <&> page </&> 941 </O> anthropogenic sources and are responsible for
reducing the pH of rain water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#37:1>
Whereas, the alkaline components ( Ca, K and Mg ) neutralise the H
ions and increase the pH of rain water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#38:1>
The high concentration of NO<sb>3</sb> at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> has not decreased the pH.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#39:1>
Hence, most of the nitrates are in the form of salts rather than
acids.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#40:1>
Also, most of the nitrates seem to be released from the soil since it
has shown good correlation with oriented elements ( Ca, K and mg ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#41:1>
The average concentration of SO<sb>4</sb> at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> is slightly higher than the world background value ( 1.1 mg / l ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#42:1>
The concentration of Ca is about 3 times higher than that of
SO<sb>4</sb> at <mention> Muktsar </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#43:1>
The acidic effects, caused due to SO<sb>4</sb> are neutralised by the
high concentrations of ca and other alkaline ionic components.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#44:1>
Therefore, the excess cations which are of alkaline nature are
mainly responsible for the observed high alkaline pH in rain water at
<mention> Muktsar </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#45:1>
The influence of sea salt on rain water at <mention> Goraur
</mention> was minimum, since the location is far away from the nearby
coast.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#46:1>
It is known that the concentration of sea salt in rain water
decreases with increase of distance from the sea.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#47:1>
The low concentrations of the soil oriented components ( Ca, K and Mg )
at <mention> Goraur </mention> indicates the minimum influence of dust
particles in the atmosphere on rain water chemistry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#48:1>
Although the concentration of SO<sb>4</sb> is not so high at
<mention> Goraur </mention> , <}> <-> yer </-> <+> yet </+> </}> the pH is
slightly acidic ( 5.30 ) which is nearer to the CO<sb>2</sb> - -
equilibrated value.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#49:1>
Hence, the main cause for the observed acidic pH of rain water at
Goraur is the low concentrations of soil oriented elements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#50:1>
similar results have been reported for the five world background
stations which are having no influence of soil and authropogenic sources (
Galloway <it> et al., </it> 1982 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#51:1>
<h> <bold> Ca / SO<sb>4</sb> ratio </bold> </h>

<p> Khemani <it> et al. </it> ( 1987 ) have suggested that the ratio of Ca to
SO<sb>4</sb> can serve as a significant parameter for identifying the
acidity and alkalinity in precipitation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#52:1>
If the ratio value is more than unity, the precipitation will be
alkaline and if the ratio value is less than unity, the precipitation will be
acidic.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#53:1>
To verify this hypothesis, the ratio values ( Ca / SO<sb>4</sb> )
were calculated for rain water collected at the two locations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#54:1>
The average ratio value of Ca / SO<sb>4</sb> at <mention> Muktsar
</mention> was more than unity ( 3.5 ) showing alkalinity in rain water,
whereas at <mention> Goraur </mention> , it was less than unity ( 0.83 )
showing acidity in rain water. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#55:1>
<h> <bold> Influence of ionic components on pH </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#56:1>
To verify the influence of individual ions on the pH of rain
water, the rainy days at <mention> Goraur </mention> have been classified
into three categories, namely, ( 1) pH<*>smaller than</*>5, ( 2) 5<*>equal to
or less than<*></*>pH<*>equal to or less than</*>6, ( 3) pH<*>greater
than</*>6.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#57:1>
The number of samples in the three categories were 8, 5 and 21
respectively<->,</-><+>.</+>

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#58:1>
However such categorisation could not be made in the case of
<mention> Muktsar </mention> since all the pH values are greater than 6.0.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#59:1>
The mean concentrations in <*> mu</*>eq / 1 of major anions and
cations are presented in figure 1 for each of the three categories mentioned
above.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#60:1>
The SO<sb>4</sb> concentration was the highest in the acidic category
and the lowest in the alkaline category, whereas, the Ca concentration was
the lowest in the acidic category and the highest in the alkaline category.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#61:1>
Similar pattern was also observed in case of K, Mg and NH<sb>4</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#62:1>
However, Cl and Na did not show any variation among the three
categories.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#63:1>
The concentration of NO<sb>3</sb> in first category was lower than
that in the other two categories.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#64:1>
Hence, SO<sb>4</sb> and Ca ions seem to be important among all
measured ions to influence the pH of rain water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#65:1>
The concentration of SO<sb>4</sb> in the first category is
important for the acidity of precipitation, while the SO<sb>4</sb>
concentration in the remaining categories is more important for the
alkalinity of precipitation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#66:1>
This indicates the contribution of mixed sources containing
sulphur compounds associated with acidic or basic compounds.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#67:1>
However, Ca concentration in all the categories is important for the
alkalinity of precipitation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#68:1>
Since, the buffering capacity of Ca is very <O> Table 1. </O> <O>
caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 942 </O> much limited, it may not be able to
neutralize the high concentration of H ions produced by acidic components (
SO<sb>4</sb> and NO<sb>3</sb> ) . </p> <O> histogram </O> <O> caption </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#69:1>
<h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-034#70:1>
In view of this study, it is concluded that there will be many
natural background pH values, each depending on the geographical location
and soil condition of the region.

<ICE-IND:W2A-034#71:1>
Hence, the interpretation of the acid rain in a region should be made
with respect to its background pH value. </p>
