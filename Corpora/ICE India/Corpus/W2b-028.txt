<bold>T</bold><smallcaps>HIS</smallcaps> <w> year's </w> Nobel
Prize for physics went to prof Clifford G Shull of the US and Prof
Bertrand N Brock-house of Canada, for work they did four decades ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#5:1>
Since then, neutron scattering, a technique developed by Professors
Shull and Brockhouse to probe matter at the atomic level, has complemented
other methods of unveiling the fascinatingly varied structure and
behaviour of matter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#6:1>
Today, neutron techniques are considered invaluable tools for
physicists, chemists and material scientists all over the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#7:1>
While the <w> Professors' </w> work <O> Photograph </O> <O>
caption </O> was complementary, in actual fact they worked independently of
each other, and were brought together by the Nobel.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#8:1>
In simple terms, Prof Shull looked at the structure of atoms,
Professor Brockhouse at their behaviour. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#9:1>
The building blocks of matter, atoms are made of three parts:
protons ( which are positively charged ) and neutrons ( which are uncharged )
, which are found in the atomic nucleus, and negatively charged electrons,
which are outside the nucleus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#10:1>
The number of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons,
making the atom electrically neutral. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#11:1>
The true nature of these subatomic particles is enigmatic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#12:1>
Sometimes, they behave like particles; other times <w> they're </w>
more like waves.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#13:1>
Take, for instance, electrons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#14:1>
When they create pictures on the television screen, they are behaving
like particles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#15:1>
But when <w> they're </w> used in an electron microscope, they behave
like waves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#16:1>
Shull and Brockhouse were the first to use neutron waves to probe
matter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#17:1>
They did so using the technique of neutron scattering. </p> <O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#18:1>
What exactly is neutron scattering?

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#19:1>
A beam of neutrons is sent in the direction of a sample to be
studied.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#20:1>
When the neutrons collide with the atomic nuclei in the sample, some
of them change their direction and energy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#21:1>
Scientists can get a lot of information by looking at these changes.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#22:1>
Neutron scattering needs a vast supply of moving neutrons ( one
million million, or 10 to the power of 12, passing through one square
centimetre each second ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#23:1>
The most common sources for such neutrons are nuclear reactors and
particle accelerators. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#24:1>
By examining a beam of scattered neutrons, scientists can
gather information about the arrangement of atoms in a given material, and
their dynamics - - their atomic vibrations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#25:1>
Every material has unique atomic vibrations, something like a
fingerprint.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#26:1>
Many properties of a material, like its specific heat ( the thermal
energy needed to increase the temperature of one kilogram by one degree
Centigrade ) , depend on its atomic vibrations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#27:1>
X-rays and electrons have been probing matter even before
neutrons came on the scene.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#28:1>
But neutrons sense atomic nuclei, they can differentiate between
light and heavy atoms, which X-rays and electrons cannot.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#29:1>
They can also be subjected to different conditions and studied.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#30:1>
The major drawback is the high cost of neutron scattering. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#31:1>
Though the technique was devised four decades ago, the basic
principles of neutron scattering techniques have remained the same.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#32:1>
However, the adv,l>ent of position-sensitive detectors, computers
and automation have combined to speed up data collection and analysis,
which can be a tedious and timeconsuming process. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#33:1>
<bold> C</bold><smallcaps>LIFFORD</smallcaps> <w> Shull's </w>
tryst with neutrons began in 1946, when, at the age of 31, he joined Emie
Wollan at the Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor at Tennessee, USA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#34:1>
( Though Prof <w> Wollan's </w> work in netron scattering is equally
important, he died before being recognised by the Nobel committee, and the
Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#35:1>
Shull, who comes from a modest background - - his father had a
hardware and home repair business - - started off studying aeronautical
engineering before switching to physics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#36:1>
He obtained his doctorate from New York University in 1941. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#37:1>
Wollan and Shull began probing the world of atoms with neutron
beams, to make a fascinating <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O>
discovery - - one which is the basis of most structural studies made on
biological molecules today.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#38:1>
They found that scattered neutrons could pinpoint the position of
light atoms like hydrogen even when in the company of heavy atoms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#39:1>
More important, they could distinguish hydrogen from deuterium,
an element which is chemically similar to hydrogen but behaves
differently.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#40:1>
This was crucial in unveiling the complex structures of biological
molecules; one can do so by selectively substituting hydrogen with
deuterium. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#41:1>
Why is this important ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#42:1>
Because this technique allowed scientists for the first time to study
the structure of biological molelcules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#43:1>
As a result, today scientists can use neutron beams and other
complementary methods to study a number of amino acids, peptides,
proteins, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#44:1>
<w> Shull's </w> other significant contribution was to use the
fact that neutrons have magnetic properties to study magnetism in solids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#45:1>
This method continues to be the sole technique of studying many
structural properties of magnetic material. </p>

Brock-house joined the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Ottawa,
Canada, in the early ' 50s.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#47:1>
He got his doctorate in 1950 from the University of Toronto.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#48:1>
Unlike Shull, who was interested mostly in detecting those neutrons
which after scattering suffer no change in energy ( almost 95 per cent
are of this type ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#49:1>
Brockhouse concentrated on the meagre five per cent which exchange
energy with the atoms in the sample.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#50:1>
Prof Brock-house devised a technique for measuring the change in
energy of the scattered neutrons.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#51:1>
His first subject of study was aluminium, with its simple
structure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#52:1>
The data he gathered helped immensely in building a mathematical
model of the collective vibrations of atoms in solid materials.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#53:1>
Sounds remote ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#54:1>
Well, this information made waves in the electronics industry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#55:1>
Among other things, the electronics revolution depends on it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#56:1>
In fact, after devising this technique, Dr. Brockhouse turned
his attention to semiconduc-tors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#57:1>
Interestingly, the first study of a semiconductor, germanium,
using neutron scattering, was done jointly by Prof Brockhouse and Dr. P. K
Iyengar who at that time had started his research career in the Atomic Energy
Establishment ( now known as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ) , and
subsequently became its director and the chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#58:1>
A number of other scientitsts from the Establishment visited Chalk
River in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s to collaborate with Prof
Brockhouse on his projects. </p>

<p>

<bold> T</bold><smallcaps>HE BARC</smallcaps> now has a
national facility for neutron beam research.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#60:1>
The neutron beams generated by the research reactor <indig> Dhruva
</indig> at BARC, and the necessary instrumentation, are now available for
researchers from all over the country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#61:1>
The facility includes several neutron spectrometers, to examine
various phenomena in the atomic world on different length- and
time-scales.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#62:1>
The small-angle neutron scattering spectrometer, for instance, is
in great demand by polymer scientists, chemists and metallurgists. </p> <*>

in a beam of light.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#66:2>
The latest development in semi-conductor technology - - the
solid-state diode-pumped laser - - is expected to bring a ray of light into
the lives of infertile couples, especially those who have undergone many
unsuccessful cycles of in-vitro fertilisation ( IVF). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#67:2>
The diode laser is formed from the minute chip of gallium
arsenide semiconductor material.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#68:2>
It converts electricity into laser light with no mirrors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#69:2>
Lilavati hospital in Mumbai has incorported this new laser technology
in their infertility unit to enhance the success rate of IVF.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#70:2>
Jaslok hospital will have it soon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#71:2>
<quote> " Lasters have added a new dimension to the advanced
treatment of infertility" </quote> , says Dr Firuza Parikh, director of the
department of infertility management and assisted reproduction at the
Jaslok hospital.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#72:2>
<quote> " For women who are over the age of 35 undergoing IVF and
assisted hatching, in procedures such as micromanipulation and in fields
such as pre-implantation genetics, the diode laser beam will be most
advantageous." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#73:2>
The laser beam is released from an attachment to the microscope
on which micromanipulation is performed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#74:2>
It may be recalled that micromanipulation allows the reproduction
biologist to do several procedures, including injecting a single sperm
into a single egg under the microscope using a fine glass needle ( a
procedure called ICSI or Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection ) or even make a
hole in the zona or outer protective shell of the human ovum ( egg ) to
help the embryo hatch out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#75:2>
<quote> " In assisted hatching, I expect the laser to be most
useful," </quote> says Dr Parikh, who pioneered mechanical assisted hatching
in the country three years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#76:2>
<quote> " Currently, in assisted hatching - - used especially for
women over the age of 35 who have a thick zona which prevents the natural
hatching of the embryo - - we use a pipette to cut through the zona making an
opening of 25-30 microns." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#77:2>
But the laser beam does away with mechanical zona drilling <O>
four photographs at the beginning of column 2 and 3 </O> <O> caption </O> and
once directed at the zona makes a quick, precise opening of two to 30 microns
( 20 to 250 times thinner than human hair ) in it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#78:2>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> definitely swifter and more advantageous to
use as it is non-invasive and minimises damage to the zona," </quote> says
Dr Hrishikesh Pai, infertility consultant at Lilavati hospital.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#79:2>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> another way to better the pregnancy rates in
older women over 38.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#80:2>
I expect it to improve from the current rate of 10-14 per cent to
about 25 per cent." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#81:2>
<quote> " Though this method is best suited for women over 35
years, especially those who have tried IVF previously, it can also be
extended for patients undergoing IVF for the first time to improve their
chances," </quote> says Dr Parikh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#82:2>
<quote> " While mechanical zona drilling may distort the cell,
laser assisted hatching simplifies the entire procedure which is completed
in 10 tp 30 milliseconds." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#83:2>
The laser beam can also be used in ICSI when the sperm tail has
to be immobilised prior to microinjection of the sperm into the oocyte ( egg ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#84:2>
Instead of the current procedure of cutting off the tails with ICSI
pipette, a single directed laser beam is shot on the sperm tail
immediately immobilising it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#85:2>
<quote> " The laser beam being precise, there is very little damage
to the sperm <O> photograph at clumn 3 and 4 below </O> <O> caption </O> and
the procedure will improve fertilisation and pregnancy rates with ICSI,"
</quote> says Dr Parikh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#86:2>
The diode laser will also revolutionise the field of
pre-implantation genetics.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#87:2>
Usually the zona is dissolved with acid tyrode and a cell is
aspirated out for detection of single gene defects by either the FISH (
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation) or PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction).

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#88:2>
<quote> " Laser will facilitate the removal of a single cell from an
embryo so that it can be subjected to genetic tests," </quote> says Dr Pai.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#89:2>
These may be required in older women and in couples who themselves
have or are carriers of genetic diseases.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#90:2>
Again the laser makes the procedures swift and minimises damage to
the embryo which could occur with manual aspiration of the cell. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#91:2>
<quote> " Laser must not be looked upon as an end in itself but
it opens up more avenues for experimentation," </quote> says Dr Parikh.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#92:2>
<quote> " It may eventually limit the IVF cycles needed and enhance
pregnancy rates." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#93:2>
Lasers already have various applications in medicine - - used for
head surgery in neurology, in opthalmology surgery for retinal detachment, to
burn aneurisms in diabetics, in cancer surgery, angioplasty, removal of
prostate, laparoscopy, and even plastic surgery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-028#94:2>
In these applications, the laser beam is usually 50-150 microns in
diameter, in the case of lasers used in infertility procedures, the beam
is much smaller in diameter - - only about 1.48 microns. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-028#95:2>
Adds Dr Pai, <quote> " The laser is an add-on breakthrough for
infertility management and we expect great things from it." </quote> </p>
