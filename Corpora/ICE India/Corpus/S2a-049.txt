<w> You'd </w> be happy to know <,,> that you and <,,> Professor Shastri <,,> they are preparing a cassette of the <,> spoken Indian English  
<,,> </X> 
 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#2:1:A>
English was <,,> very old in this country <,,> from the time of  
the East India Company <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#3:1:A>
East India Company which came to India <,> in seventeenth century  
<,> they started English in the <,> coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh to begin  
it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#4:1:A>
And then <,,> with the establishment of East India Company at Madras  
Calcutta and Bombay <,> things have improved <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#5:1:A>
And during seventeenth <,,> century as well as <,> in eighteenth  
that is <,> finally English was <,> systematized <,> and standardized <,> by  
the <w> Macaulay's </w> minute <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#6:1:A>
It was introduced in the schools which was started <,> by the East  
India Company <,> and English became <,> one of the <,> subjects of study <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#7:1:A>
People have been studying <,> English <,> for last so many <,> years  
<,> and uh <,> it became <,> a big <,,> a matter <,> after the establishment  
of the three universities <,> at the provincial cities of Madras Bombay and  
Calcutta <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#8:1:A>
English is <,> studied both for its language <,> as well as for  
literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#9:1:A>
English has influenced the Indians and very much <,> it has given  
strength and source <,> to them <,> to fight against the British later on  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#10:1:A>
Through English only <,> Indians have came to know <,> what is a  
democratic system <,> how the government works in England and the speeches of  
Burke 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#11:1:A>
And <,> many other <,> uh leaders <,> in the British Parliament <,>  
influenced the Indian <,,> leaders <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#12:1:A>
And English is one of the <,> motive factor <,> for many people <,>  
who started writing in Indian languages <,> even <,> Bankim Chandra Chatterji  
<,> who wrote <,> such a beautiful novel like uh <,> <mention> Anandmath  
</mention> <,> was influenced by <,> English and he gave a slogan called  
<indig> Vande Mataram </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#13:1:A>
So English has become one of the important languages <,> in India  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#14:1:A>
English is studied today <,> in schools <,> colleges <,>  
universities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#15:1:A>
English is the lingua franca <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#16:1:A>
And <,> I think through English only <,> for the first time <,>  
India is <,> uh made one <,> uh otherwise it will be <,> difficult for most  
of the Indians <,> to know each other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#17:1:A>
Because there are so many languages in India <,> there are nearly  
seven hundred languages in India 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#18:1:A>
There was a cultural unity <,> but a linguistic unity was not there  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#19:1:A>
And uh <,> therefore English has provided this <,> and in this <,>  
unity of language <,> people began to be united they used to exchange their  
<,> opinions they used to <,> read newspapers which were coming in English  
and therefore <,> the people like uh <,> uh Srinivasa Iyengar who has written  
about the development of Indian English <,> through his book Indian Writing  
in English 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#20:1:A>
It is a <,> good thing the English have done to this country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#21:1:A>
During the last two hundred years <,> the language was <,,>  
developing in different ways <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#22:1:A>
English is not spoken uniformly <,> by all the Indians <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#23:1:A>
As a matter of fact English is <,,> not spoken uniformly <,> even  
in England <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#24:1:A>
Only R P is spoken only South of London <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#25:1:A>
There are other dialects like uh <,> uh Scottish dialect or Welsh  
dialect or other dialects which are <,> not standard dialects of English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#26:1:A>
Like that in India also <,> uh the English is influenced by <,>  
Indian languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#27:1:A>
Every Indian who speaks English is influenced <-> is </-> by <,> by  
his mother tongue <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#28:1:A>
And there is a Telugu English <,> there is a Tamilian English <,>  
there is a Punjabi English <,> there is a Hindi English <,> like that various  
dialects are there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#29:1:A>
For these things we had to bring out a standard <,> a standard to  
understand each other <,> and a standard which can be useful <,> to have a  
<,> to systemize the <,> this International language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#30:1:A>
English is <,> essential today in the modern world <,> because  
English is spoken by the largest <,> number of people in the world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#31:1:A>
English is <,> spoken in America <,> English is spoken in Australia  
<,> New Zealand Canada <,> and many other countries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#32:1:A>
I think nearly one third of the <,> uh people of the world <,> they  
are speaking in English 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#33:1:A>
English is adopted by even other countries <,> who <}> <-> are </->  
<+> do </+> </}> not speak English because of its uh <,> business <,>  
purposes and <,> transport purposes <,> and many other purposes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#34:1:A>
Therefore <,> English is essential today to the country 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#35:1:A>
Probably <,,> the old <,> classic classical and uh <,,> English is  
spoken <,> in the colonies as pointed by <,> Rushdie <,> in a better way than  
his own <,> mother country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#36:1:A>
So English is International nobody can <,> say that English is not  
wanted today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#37:1:A>
English is <,> required for anybody to become international in  
communication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#38:1:A>
They <,,> therefore <,> English is going to live in India even <,,>  
uh against the wishes of many other people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#39:1:A>
And there are people in this country <,> <w> who're </w> talking  
that English is to be replaced by <,> Hindi <,> and regional languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#40:1:A>
Regional languages are to be studied <,> as well as the national  
language is studied <,> and at the same time we require an international  
language <,> which will <,> uh make us a part of the world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#41:1:A>
Because the world is only a global village today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#42:1:A>
India cannot survive without English <,> or a International  
language like English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#43:1:A>
And uh <,> it is important for every country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#44:1:A>
Therefore <,> English will remain with us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#45:1:A>
And English is <,,> studied even in the Central Institute of  
English and Foreign Languages <,> which has come into existence in nineteen  
fifty-eight <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#46:1:A>
This Institute was established <,> when the Government of India <,>  
in the education department <,> and by the British council as well as the  
Ford Foundation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#47:1:A>
And it was <,,> established with a specific purpose <,> to improve  
<,> the language content of the <}> <-> <.> En </.> </-> <=> English </=>  
</}> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#48:1:A>
And <,> English literature is taught <,> by all universities in  
their department of English literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#49:1:A>
But language was not studied <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#50:1:A>
There is a controversy whether <,> English language is <,> to be  
learnt through literature <,> or literature is to be learnt through <,>  
English language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#51:1:A>
Both are important <,> they are the two <.> co </.> uh sides of the  
same coin <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#52:1:A>
And one can <,> learn <,> good English and by that he can learn  
good literature <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#53:1:A>
Or if one is a constant reader of <,> literature one may acquire  
<,> unconsciously <,> good English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#54:1:A>
But English has many other aspects <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#55:1:A>
It has its spoken aspect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#56:1:A>
One should be conscious of the <,> pronunciation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#57:1:A>
And if a Indian goes and talks in <,> <}> <-> United States of  
India </-> <=> United States of America </=> </}> <,> one may not understand  
what he is speaking because <,> his English contains <,> wrong stresses <,>  
and wrong tone <,> probably <,> people will not understand him <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#58:1:A>
Therefore it is essential to standardize <,> what we speak <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#59:1:A>
And the <,> <-> Institute of </-> Central Institute of English and  
Foreign Languages <,> makes a good effort it <,> at it 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#60:1:A>
It has a language lab <,> it has various other facilities <,>  
through which it wants to improve <,> the standard of <,> of English <,>  
spoken by every segment of the people of India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#61:1:A>
Therefore number of people <,> after their M A <,> or  
postgraduation in English language or education or some other subject <,>  
they come to the Central Institute of English <,> for studying <,> English  
language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#62:1:A>
We have different courses here and uh <,> we have E L T <,>  
methodology <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#63:1:A>
We have a language laboratory <,> and the department of spoken  
English <,> and uh <,> phonetics 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#64:1:A>
We have other departments also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#65:1:A>
These departments <,> during a course of one year <,> they give a  
systematic training <,> in studying English language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#66:1:A>
And uh <,> this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here  
<,> to learn English because when they go back <,> they can teach better  
English to their students <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#67:1:A>
It will have a percolative effect <,> because these teachers who  
are trained <,> they can teach better <,> when they go back to the schools or  
colleges <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#68:1:A>
And the students are to be taught young <,> because their  
pronunciation <,> if it is influenced by a trained teacher in English at the  
Central Institute of English <,> he will be a better speaker and an effective  
speaker <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#69:1:A>
Communication <,> with proper pronunciation is important <,> to  
understand each other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#70:1:A>
Therefore English <,> spoken English particularly is <,> important  
<,> at the regional level <,> at the national level as well as international  
level <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#71:1:A>
And <,> English is given the importance in our education system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#72:1:A>
As a matter of fact <,> most of the publications in India <,> are  
in <,> English uh <,> every year <w> we're </w> publishing nearly eighteen  
thousand books in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#73:1:A>
Out of eighteen thousand nearly <,> eight thousand to nine thousand  
books are in English <,> and whereas the remaining <,> are published in the  
regional languages or uh <,> vernacular languages of India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#74:1:A>
So the publication <,> not only in the case of books <,> even in  
the case of newspaper <,> most of the important newspapers are in English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#75:1:A>
Newpapers like <,> <mention> Times of India <,> The Hindu  
</mention> and uh <,> they are very effective communication media <,> most of  
<,> the circulation of these two papers are <,> very large <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#76:1:A>
People throughout India they read these newspapers <,> and uh <,>  
the English is the lingua franca today in India effective <,> connector  
between various states <,> who speaks various languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#77:1:A>
Therefore English <,> is uh <,> unlikely to go from this country  
<,> and English will remain for a long time to come <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#78:1:A>
Uhm <,,> so the <,> the English has uh <,> uh in English is <,>  
part of the <,> national life <,> and uh <,> throughout education <,,> the  
students in the schools and colleges they read it 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#79:1:A>
But <,> mostly the English is an effective medium <,> only from the  
college level <,> after school leaving <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#80:1:A>
Therefore <,> the English if it is introduced <,> even <,> at uh  
<,,> at class three year class four that will be <,> more effective <,> and  
uh <,> a bilingual child <,> or a multilingual child is more intelligent <,>  
and the language can be learnt only <,> <}> <- > at the </-> <+> in </+> </}>  
childhood <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#81:1:A>
And instead of forcing English <,> at a later stage of life <,>  
which will be difficult <,> and as a child <,> will pick up <-> a </->  
languages easier <,> and <,> quicker <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#82:1:A>
Therefore English would be introduced <,> at a uh <,,> the school  
level <,> rather than at uh <,> college level <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#83:1:A>
And uh <,> English is also important to get jobs <,> and people  
with more <,> education they want to go outside their country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#84:1:A>
If India like <}> <-> <.> I </.> </-> <=> India </=> </}> which has  
<,> large population <,> if it wants to export its educated people <,> <}>  
<-> to other <.> countr </.> </-> <=> to other countries </=> </}> <,> like  
Singapore <,> or Saudi Arabia <,> or U S A English is essential <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#85:1:A>
Even in the case of the professional <,,> uh educated people like  
engineers <,> or doctors if they want to go abroad <,> they require English  
language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#86:1:A>
And uh <,> without English one at <,> one cannot go <,> outside  
India 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#87:1:A>
And even <+> if </+> he goes outside he will find number of  
difficulties <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#88:1:A>
And uh <,> professionally also if one wants to be up-to- date <,>  
he should know <,> and he should read English books <,,> books which are  
coming in English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#89:1:A>
And <,> most of the uh <,> knowledge which is created throughout  
<,> the world <,> somehow or other <,> by translation <,> or by <,> uh  
recreation it is coming into English language books which are published on  
large scale in England <,> America <,> Australia <,> Hongkong and other  
places 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#90:1:A>
Therefore <,> through <,> the English language books only <,> you  
come to know what is happening <,> outside <,> our own country 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#91:1:A>
And uh <,> they through them the research is developed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#92:1:A>
Research is one of the important activity for any country <,>  
because <,,> without research it is you cannot uh <,> develop 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#93:1:A>
And uh <,> the development for the development of a country you  
require information <,> latest technology <,> latest knowledge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#94:1:A>
Knowledge is a resource today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#95:1:A>
Now without knowledge you cannot have anything <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#96:1:A>
It can be other resources <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#97:1:A>
You can have a resource of <O> one word </O> <,> you can have a <,>  
coal resources <,> you can have petroleum resources <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#98:1:A>
But knowledge resource is very important <,> knowledge is power 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#99:1:A>
Uh <,> even you take a small country like Japan <,> which is only  
as big as an Andhra Pradesh <,> but it is <,> today on the <,> top of the  
world 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#100:1:A>
It is because of the technology which they learn through English  
language <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#101:1:A>
And even England <,> which is not bigger than <,> one state of our  
country <,> and England ruled the world <,> for a long time <,> and there was  
a saying that sun <,> sun never set <,> on the British Empire <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#102:1:A>
How did uh <,> the small countries small isles like <,> British  
Isles could rule such a vast world <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#103:1:A>
It is because of the latest innovations that have taken place <,>  
in their country and these are essential <,> if you have come to know about  
<,> the developments in science it has <,> it was only possible by reading  
<,> English language books <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#104:1:A>
We have come to know about <w> Newton's </w> theory of gravity and  
even <w> Einstein's </w> <,> theory of relativity 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#105:1:A>
All these things helped us <,> helped our science <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#106:1:A>
And particularly in science and technology most of the books are  
in English <,> and they are not in vernacular languages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-049#107:1:A>
The defect is <,> the international terminology is in English <,>  
and it is a standardised terminology <,> it is not possible to have the  
translations of the same terminology <,> in our vernacular languages <,> <->  
the </-> our languages <-> have </-> <,> haven't developed that much <,>
</I>
