<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#1:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a great privilege for me to be <,> commentating
on the <,> women tennis <,,> because uh <,,> of the past experience for
nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#2:1:A>
I was just before the match <,,> speaking with uh <,,> Nirupama that
on the screen you see Janaki <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#3:1:A>
And uh <,,> Janaki is from Bombay <,,> and she is uh <,,> Janaki is
from Bombay and she is uh <,,> looking fit at the moment <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#4:1:A>
She has lost uh <,,> this is a wrong caption I think we are showing
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#5:1:A>
That about I was pointing out <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#6:1:B>
Uh this is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#7:1:A>
This is Nirupama <,,> <w> that's </w> Nirupama and she is <,,>
seventeen years now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#8:1:A>
So I was just telling you telling the viewers that just before I
entered the uh <,,> commentators box I was talking to Nirupama <,,> and I was
talking to her father <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#9:1:A>
In fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#10:1:A>
And they both were telling me that uh <,,> Nirupama was <,> when
she was about fourteen <,,> this girl was already <,> uh uh number one in
India

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#11:1:A>
She had won the national uh <,> championship hard court and she has
shown great promise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#12:1:A>
But again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked
up <,,> and groomed much earlier <,,> and she also suffers from the same
problem

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#13:1:A>
She says <quote> now <w> I'm </w> already seventeen <,> and <w>
it's </w> so late </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#14:1:A>
And uh <,> why didn't she go into <,> big game and big tennis at
the age of <,> thirteen or fourteen <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#15:1:A>
The same answer that lack of finances lack of support <,,> and uh
<,> for women tennis I don't think India is a right place at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#16:1:A>
<w> We've </w> <w> it's it's </w> continuing for years on end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#17:1:A>
I remember the same thing used to happen <,,> uptil nineteen
eighty-one <,> until nineteen eighty-two till I played tennis <,> and the
same thing is continuing in ninety-four

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#18:1:A>
Where have we come ten years from now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#19:1:A>
<w> I'd </w> like to uh uh <,> interview her father in fact <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#20:1:A>
Why don't you come and share your views with us <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#21:1:A>
<w> We'll </w> do that a bit later because we have the <,,> first
game <,,> in progress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#22:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> Nirupama serving the first serve <,,> <O>
applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#23:1:A>
Beautiful crosscourt returned by Janaki <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#24:1:A>
Love fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#25:1:A>
You see Janaki Nirupama serving now to <,,> Janaki <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#26:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a beautiful forehand <,,> down the line returned
<,,> <O> applaud </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#27:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> love thirty <,> to Nirupama on her service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#28:1:A>
Keeping the ball in play <,,> Nirupama claiming fifteen thirty <,,>
for the first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#29:1:A>
Next shot there <,> a beautiful return <,,> by Janaki cross again
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#30:1:A>
Put away forehand crosscourt volley <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#31:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the recaption again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#32:1:A>
A very good <,> pick up there by Nirupama <,,> makes it <,,>
fifteen forty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#33:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a drop shot there by Janaki <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#34:1:A>
Nirupama did not even try for this ball I think it is far too long
for her to run <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#35:1:A>
In uh <,> leading tennis unfortunately service has never played
such a major <,,> role <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#36:1:A>
And there we have first break <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#37:1:A>
Whereas in <w> men's </w> tennis it <,> acquires much greater
significance <,,> probably because the boys follow up their service to the
net <,> and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#38:1:A>
And that makes the service as good as any other ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#39:1:A>
It looses <w> it's </w> <,,> significance altogether <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#40:1:A>
When we have big service in the world like Martina Navratilova and
<?> Beligin king </?> <,> and they used to follow up their balls to the net
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#41:1:A>
And once they did that <,> it made their service and it made their
ball and made the volley much more effective <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#42:1:A>
For it one has to stay around at the base line then service really
<,,> does not have that much of significance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#43:1:A>
We have the first break of Nirupama <,,> and Janaki up one love in
the first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#44:1:A>
We hope that the <,> <w> women's </w> tennis is not such a wash out
as it was in the <w> men's </w> <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#45:1:A>
Love fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#46:1:A>
Nirupama has beaten Janaki earlier when they met this year <,,> <w>
that's </w> what she told me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#47:1:A>
The ball seems to be much faster on grass for Janaki <,,> <O> cough
</O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#48:1:A>
Janaki serving love thirty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#49:1:A>
Oh <,,> Janaki is uh <,,> relying on this rough shot <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#50:1:A>
But I don't find Nirupama making any effort to come forward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#51:1:A>
This tactics of Janaki is going to pay off untill <,> unless
Nirupama tries to come up to the net <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#52:1:A>
Beautiful shot there by Janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt
taking a round of the court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#53:1:A>
Equalising the score <,> at thirty all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#54:1:A>
First of service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#55:1:A>
Forty thirty <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#56:1:A>
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama <,,> taking on the offensive for
the first time <,,> and hitting that ball <,,> crosscourt forehand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#57:1:A>
There is that replay <,,> a slight backhand return by Janaki and
that the put away <,,> crosscourt <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#58:1:A>
Deuce <,,> first first service <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#59:1:A>
Uh <,,> Nirupama trying to <,,> make a winner out of it second
return <,> second service <,> however she missed the points <,> she <,,> went
in the prickly part where the ball didn't got <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#60:1:A>
<w> That's </w> deuce once again <,,> first first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#61:1:A>
Return of service <,,> good return of service by Nirupama <,,> <O>
cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#62:1:A>
I think that <,,> Nirupama really threw away that point <,,> she
had a break point <,,> from <w> Janaki's </w> service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#63:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not going to be a very easy <,,> match for her if she
throws away such easy points <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#64:1:A>
Good backhand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#65:1:A>
Oh <,,> Janaki just <,,> could not keep up the consistency <,,> and
hit the ball <,,> double fisted backhand out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#66:1:A>
Advantage once again to Nirupama <,,> to take a break back <,> into
the first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#67:1:A>
Second service Janaki serving <,,> advantage to Nirupama <,,> safe
backhand return <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#68:1:A>
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama <w> who's </w> taken on the
offensive <,,> hitting on both the flags very beautifully <,> and has broken
that <,,> service of Janaki <,,> making it <,,> one game all <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#69:1:A>
And <w> there's </w> the replay of that shot <,> that wonderful
forehand crosscourt winners <,,> and no way could Janaki ever reach that ball
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#70:1:A>
One game all <,,> first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#71:1:A>
Very good return of service there by Janaki <,,> meeting the ball
early <,,> and using the <,,> timing of the service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#72:1:A>
<w> There's </w> that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#73:1:A>
Quick return of service there by Janaki <,,> and <w> that's </w>
the return of Nirupama through down <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#74:1:A>
Yes <,,> Janaki slices the ball <,,> far too often <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#75:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a nice shot there by Janaki <,,> making it <,>
thirty all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#76:1:A>
He took she took the ball on the line <,,> <w> that's </w> the
replay <,> and you see her totally bent in total position <,,> going in for
that <,> tidal line forehand winner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#77:1:A>
Oh <,,> that was just <,,> total bad luck she tried to hit forehand
crosscourt <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#78:1:A>
I think she needed to bend a little more <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#79:1:A>
Nirupama serving <,,> forty thirty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#80:1:A>
Foul <,,> out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#81:1:A>
<w> That's </w> deuce once again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#82:1:A>
Nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#83:1:A>
Beautiful shot there by Janaki <,,> brought the low ball <,> low
ball <,,> returned beautifully by Janaki there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#84:1:A>
See how low the ball is keeping <,> see <,,> and she is able to <,>
hit that winner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#85:1:A>
Uhm <,,> good service there by Nirupama <,> stretching around the
backhand corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#86:1:A>
And justifies only low return <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#87:1:A>
Deuce once again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#88:1:A>
Foul first service <,,> advantage Janaki <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#89:1:A>
Third person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#90:1:A>
Wonderful top spin <,> backhand return by Janaki <,,> forcing <,>
Nirupama to deuce once again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#91:1:A>
Now a drop shot there by Nirupama <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#92:1:A>
I don't think she <,,> really wanted to hit that shot it was <,,>
stroke of luck that <,,> fell so short <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#93:1:A>
In grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh <,,> difficult to
handle it <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#94:1:A>
That game to Nirupama <,,> leading two one in the first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#95:1:A>
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#96:1:A>
To carry on the commentary Mahin Kapoor <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#97:1:C>
She is <,> coming out with the shots <,> which in the
beginning she wasn't <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#98:1:C>
She is getting to the winner <w> she's </w> getting the rhythm now
<,,> and is able to <,,> reach the ball faster <,,> and even the timing of
the ball is much more accurate with her now <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#99:1:B>
And uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#100:1:C>
Beautiful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#101:1:C>
That was a beautiful shot there by Janaki Krishnamurthy

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#102:1:C>
What all can see here is the <,,> low rally which they had <,,>
this kind of of <,> best long rally uh in the match here <,> there you can
see the <,,> crosscourt backhand return <,> and once again a crosscourt
return by <,> Nirupama and down the line winner <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#103:1:B>
All are just <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#104:1:C>
Beautiful shot there by Nirupama <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#105:1:C>
Beautiful shot <,,> out of the blue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#106:1:C>
You could see Nirupama doing a little variation in that game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#107:1:C>
She started tossing the ball a little higher <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#108:1:C>
You could see that toss now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#109:1:C>
<w> That's </w> the winner across <,,> she sprung out of the blue
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#110:1:C>
Fifteen all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#111:1:C>
Oh <,> <w> that's </w> <w> Nirupama's </w> mistake there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#112:1:C>
She needs to steady down a little more <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#113:1:C>
Fifteen thirty <,> uh thirty fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#114:1:C>
<w> That's </w> Janaki <O> a few words </O> which is <,> not
called for at the moment at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#115:1:C>
<w> That's </w> the beautiful <,,> slice uh combat between the two
<,,> girls <,,> a shot slight backhand combat with <O> two words </O> it went
on and on until the <,,> Janaki gave up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#116:1:C>
<w> That's </w> a break point for Nirupama <,> and a set point
also <,,> of the first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#117:1:C>
<w> That's </w> it the set goes to Nirupama <,,> at six two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#118:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#119:1:A>
<&> In Hindi </&> she played very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#120:1:A>
See what Nirupama was <,> rightly telling me is that uh <,> she
has showed potential much earlier <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#121:1:A>
But she says that uh <,> <quote> nobody did anything for me <,,>
and I had no financer </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#122:1:A>
In fact I told her <w> you're </w> from <,> Tamil Nadu and Tamil
Nadu does a lot

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#123:1:A>
But she said <quote> no <,,> I have not got anything from any
support from any quarter </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#124:1:A>
The <w> women's </w> tennis also needs to be picked up you see
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#125:1:A>
Beautiful but missed shot there by Janaki <,,> first <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#126:1:A>
Thirty love to Nirupama <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#127:1:A>
Lovely shot again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#128:1:A>
Nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#129:1:A>
Just shaping up well playing well <,,> and she still has uh <,>
good future ahead of her <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#130:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#131:1:A>
<&> In HIndi </&> and then uh Nirupama also needs to <,,> go
up on the net much more than she has taken her position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#132:1:A>
Oh <,,> that ball was called out so <,,> forty fifteen to Nirupama
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#133:1:A>
Janaki is not showing any <,,> signs of coming back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#134:1:A>
In the <,,> beginning game of the second set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#135:1:A>
Oh ho beautiful shot there by Janaki

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#136:1:A>
I think that <,,> <w> she's </w> really gone out of the way with
the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#137:1:A>
<w> That's </w> <,,> the replay and <w> that's </w> the crosscourt
shot that Janaki gave up <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#138:1:A>
<w> It's </w> beautiful <,> crosscourt <,,> winner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#139:1:A>
Forty thirty to Nirupama <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#140:1:A>
Easy return <,> beautiful shot there <,,> easy sitter there
sitting there for Nirupama to put on net <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#141:1:A>
You know there is one thing I wanted to share with you Mahin <,>
<{> <[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> and also for the benefit of our viewers
<,,> that <,> ours uh <,> that see uh replay which <w> we've </w> been
watching then <w> I'll </w> share it with you <,> there is that put away shot
which gives her a game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#142:1:A>
You know in our country <,> <w> it's </w> very difficult for women
to come forward at this level <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#143:1:A>
See for men <w> it's </w> much easier <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#144:1:A>
Our country it is very traditional <,,> and a women has to perform
many roles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#145:1:A>
She has to also be a housewife <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#146:1:A>
She also has to be a daughter at home <,,> she also has to do her
studies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#147:1:A>
And if they come forward and perform like this in matches <,,>
then they should be encouraged <,,> because they have a triple role if they
become a sportswomen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#148:1:A>
They have <,> because in India sports alone is not enough they ask
you what else are you <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#149:1:A>
What are you in your studies ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#150:1:A>
And are you an M B A ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#151:1:A>
Or are you a Ph D <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#152:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very important in our country to be a Ph <w> D's
</w> also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#153:1:A>
And plus a woman <,> is never only a Ph D and a sportswoman <,>
she also has to look after her home <,> she has to have babies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#154:1:A>
So therefore you know <,> for a woman life is much more tougher
<,,> and if she comes out of her shell and becomes a sportswoman <,,> I think
she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#155:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#156:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#157:1:A>
But this Nirupama is showing promise but <,,> <&> in Hindi
</&> then the age is over <,,> <O> applaud </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#158:1:A>
Fifteen all <,,> Nirupama was saying <w> she's </w> uh <,,>
attending an academy <,,> abroad <w> she's </w> <,> training there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#159:1:A>
Just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-020#160:1:A>
Now <,,> if the family is <indig> uske peeche </indig> <,> <w>
it's </w> okay otherwise <w> there's </w> nobody <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#161:1:C>
Her mother is uh <,> with her in the academy <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#162:1:B>
Uh Nirupama

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-020#163:1:A>
Nirupama <,,>
