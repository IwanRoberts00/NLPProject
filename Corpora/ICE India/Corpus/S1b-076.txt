<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#1:1:A>
Uh <,,> I must initially <,> say that I am really grateful to
<,,> Saraswati <,,> for having accepted this invitation <,,> and uh agreed to
visit our <,> department <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#2:1:A>
I think she is first uh <w> let's </w> say <,> who has come from
such a long distance <,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#3:1:A>
Saraswati from Madras <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#4:1:A>
Uh <,> she is a distinguished scholar <,> and <w> I'm </w> happy
that she is <,,> here with us <,> this afternoon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#5:1:A>
Now <,> according to the <,,> official speaking the requirements of
the open defence <,,> the candidate has to sum up <,> the argument of his
thesis <,,> in about twenty minutes about <,> whether it should be convenient

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#6:1:B>
Officially you can take an hour <O> laughs </O> but <w> I'm
</w> sure you won't like <?> him </?> <,,> <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#7:1:A>
So for about twenty minutes <,> you speak and <,> sum up <,>
the main arguments of <,,> thesis and <,> findings <,> accentuating the
findings <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#8:1:A>
So I request him <,> uh to summarise it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#9:1:A>
And then after that <,,> uh when he receives uh <,,> sir then after
that <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#10:1:B>
Questions

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#11:1:A>
Questions <,,> from <,> from the external <,> experts <,,>
other than the referees <,,> these questions should be treated <O> two words
</O> <,> and then questions <,> raised by the referees <,> both the referees
<,> <O> cough </O> and then if necessary those who are present here they will
also <,,> raise their questions if required sometime <,> from the candidate
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#12:1:A>
So I now request uh <,> Mr Karande to sum up his <,> thesis <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-076#13:1:C>
Thank you sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#14:1:C>
The studying <O> two words </O> uh some features of <,> educated
Indian English speech <,> an <O> one word </O> study <,> uh has five chapters
besides introduction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#15:1:C>
In the introduction <,,> uh some <,> background has been explained
<,> as what led me <,> to pick up the study <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#16:1:C>
So <,> some small work that I <,> did in a partial fulfillment of
<,> M Phil degree <,> so that led me to uh <,> switch on to these topics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#17:1:C>
Even though <,> the focus of <,> the <O> one word </O> study was
<,> uh an <?> articulate </?> in phonetics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#18:1:C>
But here <,> the focus is shifted to <,> <O> one word </O>
phonetics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#19:1:C>
So <,> again <,,> two things <,,> one is uh <,> collection of data
<,,> that is <,,> Elicited data <,> and Corpus data <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#20:1:C>
So Elicited data <,> has been <,> rather you know not paid much
attention for one or two reasons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#21:1:C>
And Corpus data has been uh <,,> preferred over here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#22:1:C>
For two reasons mainly <,> and the one reason is <,> in elicited
data <,> if the data happens to be <,> the words are <,> word-strings or
sentences <,> then this sentences <,> and words you know <,> most of the time
they are <,> <O> cough </O> isolated from the context <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#23:1:C>
And so they are likely to <,> loose some phonetic features <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#24:1:C>
And so corpus data <,> which is uh a continous speech may be <,> or
discussion or news <,,> particularly here the news reading <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#25:1:C>
So it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#26:1:C>
So all the required <,> features that is <O> one word </O> features
<,> of <,> the strings and words required <,> they were all intact <,> or
they were <-> got </-> all intact in this data <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#27:1:C>
And so this corpus data it was preferred to the <,> elicited data
<O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#28:1:C>
So the <,> the limiting why this <,,> uh chapter or why this area
<,> was chosen <,> that is uh media news <,> that is news broadcast on T V
and uh <,> Radio <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#29:1:C>
So one reason <,> uh main reason for <,> choosing this area was <,>
uh that now-a-days <,> the media in particular T V it has been a common
feature over <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#30:1:C>
So for collecting data <,> or choosing news <,> or the news readers
<,> or the news that we get <,> atleast <,> thrice a day <,> so it has been
invariably permanent feature on T V and <,> this uh Radio <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#31:1:C>
Plus <,> the news reader chosen <,> uh to read news <,> either on T
V or on Radio you know <,> they <,> normally represent all the linguistic
communities <,> uh that exist in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#32:1:C>
And so this representation <,> of the linguistic communities <,>
they have been <,> rather you know collected over years

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#33:1:C>
So these are <,> the two reasons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#34:1:C>
So one more reason <,> behind choosing this area and the topic is
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#35:1:C>
So normally we look up to <,> this media news <,> as a kind of
English <,> that might be followed by the listeners <,> of T V and Radio so
<,> sometime you know it is <,> regarded as norm <,> from the listeners point
of view <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#36:1:C>
And uh <,> standard from <,> uh say T V or <,> Radio point of view
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#37:1:C>
So for these <,> reasons you know this area was chosen <,> by me
<-> here </-> over here <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#38:1:C>
Chapter number three is about uh <,> Spectrography <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#39:1:C>
So spectrography <}> <-> <.> i </.> </-> <=> it </=> </}> has been
given a due importance in the study only because <,> without <,>
spectrographic analysis <,> or the <O> one word </O> analysis the study would
have been <,> uh simply impossible <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#40:1:C>
So this sophisticated device <,> or this gadget you know it has all
the <,,> uh facilities you know that gives <,,> uh over here the visual
representation of all the <O> one word </O> features <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#41:1:C>
So once we feed <,> a sound or any sound segment to the machine it
gives us <,> uh the visual <,> impression of the sound on the monitor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#42:1:C>
And that monitor <,> gives us <,> that sound in a <O> one word </O>
feature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#43:1:C>
So it records uh <,> frequency <,> it records amplitude <,> it
records <}> <-> <.> du </.> </-> <=> duration </=> </}> <,> it records <O>
one word </O> <,> it records <,> a <O> one word </O> you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#44:1:C>
So all this features <,> they decide <,> what sound is produced or
what sound is pronounced by <,> a speaker over here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#45:1:C>
And so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound
segment <,> or the manner <,> of the articulation <,> of a particular segment
you know that can be <,> to a great extent <,> is decided by <,> looking at
or studying or interpreting these spectrographs

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#46:1:C>
And so spectograph <,> has its own place in linguistic study <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#47:1:C>
The next chapter <,,> is analysis of the data <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#48:1:C>
In analysis of the data <,> these three areas chosen for the study
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#49:1:C>
So the first is the duration <,> and the four pairs <,> of uh <,>
pure vowels <,> particularly long and short pairs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#50:1:C>
These four pairs have been chosen <,> so the purpose behind
choosing <,> this four pairs was because it has been assumed <,> or it has
been <,> uh talked of <,> much by the scholars <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#51:1:C>
All the people in this area <,> that is Indian speakers of English
<,> that is educated Indian speakers of English <,> <O> cough </O> they
hardly maintain <,> the short long distinction in their speech you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#52:1:C>
And so <,> for these reasons <,> these four pairs <,> they were
selected <,> or these were <,> they were chosen as one of the topics over
here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#53:1:C>
So <,,> here while <,,> deciding the boundaries <,> of the vocalic
<,> segments over here some <,> difficulties were there <,,> but to get over
the difficulties <,> certain strategies were to be thought out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#54:1:C>
And here the strategy is <,,> uh spectrograph machine <,> or this
device came to <,,> uh my assistance here <,> because here the spectrograph
<,> spectrograph machine it <,> shows you <,> which is a vowel <,> and which
is <,> a consonant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#55:1:C>
So these features <,> or the certain features on the basis of those
features <,> it was possible <,> to catch or it was possible to decide the
segment boundaries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#56:1:C>
So with the help of this segment boundaries <,> this pure vowels or
the vocalic <,> segments they were <,> detected or they were located and
their duration it was <,> ultimately again you know decided upon <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#57:1:C>
So in this <,> uh chapter or in this analysis <,> it has been found
out <,> that is <,> the distinction between short and long <,> even though it
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#58:1:C>
There is uh some other reason <,> why it is not that clear <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#59:1:C>
But the distinction <,> a short and long <,> it is there in the
speech of educated Indian English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#60:1:C>
Of course you know if we compare <,> uh this phenomenon <,> with
the English spoken by the native speaker of English <,> then it is very clear
<,> that is length <,,> of any <}> <-> <.> voc </.> </-> <=> uh vocalic </=>
</}> <,,> item or the length of any vocalic <,> uh segment you know is not as
much as <,> the length of <,> the particular or the same vocalic segment
pronounced by <,> the native speaker <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#61:1:C>
And there is obvious reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#62:1:C>
But within the system <,> used by any educated Indian English <,>
uh speaker you know <,> he does maintain <,> a particular kind of <,> uh
relationship <,> or does maintain a particular kind of system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#63:1:C>
And where he distinguishes <,> a short counterpart from its <,>
long one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#64:1:C>
So this is one finding over there

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#65:1:C>
The second <,> area or the second topic chosen <,> so it is <,> a
dipthong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#66:1:C>
So <,> on the dipthong <,> three dipthongs

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#67:1:C>
Again you know even <,> uh professor Bansal <,> so he treats just
<,> one dipthong that is A <,> or OU <,> which is there he says in <,> uh
educated Indian <,,> uh English <,> speaker <,> and others too which <,> I
deal with over here

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#68:1:C>
So they are A <,> and another is AE <,> so these two <,> so my
findings <,> in this study they are very much confirmed <,> with uh <,> Dr
<w> Bansal's </w> and uh <,> that <w> Bansal's </w> conclusions <,> or his
findings and findings by <,> uh may be Professor Kachru <,> and Nihalani <,>
<O> two words </O> these people also

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#69:1:C>
But here it was an attempt <,> to verify it with the help of uh <,>
<O> one word </O> study of <O> one word </O> means over here

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#70:1:C>
So <,,> one thing <,> uh the one way to verify <,> dipthongs <,> it
was <,> a spectrograph <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#71:1:C>
So in spectrograph <,> one <O> one word </O> feature <,> that is a
<O> one word </O> <,> and these <O> one word </O> were decided whether a
particular vowel <,,> uh pronounced by a speaker <,> was a pure vowel or <,>
a dipthong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#72:1:C>
There was a second <O> one word </O> <,> or the F two <,> what we
say or the hub theory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#73:1:C>
So these hub theory or the F two <,> second <O> one word </O> it
gives a clear cut picture <,,> of the dipthong as well as of <,> a pure vowel
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#74:1:C>
If it happens to be a pure vowel then <,> F two or the second <O>
one word </O> it is <,> straight

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#75:1:C>
It is <,> in a straight position <,> and when it is a dipthong <,>
then there is uh <,> uh frequency shift <,> or there is a F two transition
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#76:1:C>
And these F two transition it is in terms of <,> frequency over
there

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#77:1:C>
So it can be seen <,,> very clearly <,> with the help of <,> a
spectrogram <,> which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which
is not or which is a dipthong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#78:1:C>
So the finding are these <,> that is most of <,> the Indian
educated Indian speakers you know <,> so some of them you know <,> there are
certain news readers <,> that is educated Indian <,> uh speakers you know <,>
of English <,> that who do maintain <,> this dipthongs who do pronounce a
dipthong but the second element is not as stressed <,> it is as boldly
pronounced as it should have been

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#79:1:C>
And so <,> the shift or the transition shift or F two shift <,> F
two transition <,> it is not very much bold over there

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#80:1:C>
And so at the level of perception <,,> uh even though there is a
transition shift <,> even though there is F two transition <,> that F two
transition is not very much felt by the listeners <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#81:1:C>
The third topic <,> or the third area chosen for the study <,> it
is stress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#82:1:C>
Even in case of stress <,,> uh it is said <,> uh that Indian
speakers of English <,> educated Indian speakers of English <,> they do not
confirm with <,> the native speakers of English <,> as far as stress is
concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#83:1:C>
But there is a some pattern <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#84:1:C>
But which pattern in the present study it has been found out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#85:1:C>
I particularly neglected <,,> monosyllabic <,> disyllabic and even
trisyllabic words which form <,> again <,> the great part of <,> anybodys
speech <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#86:1:C>
So <,> multisyllabic words <,> that is words with more than three
syllables <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#87:1:C>
So they are called the multisyllable in the present study <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#88:1:C>
And these words you know they have been studied <,> uh for the
purpose of stress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#89:1:C>
Over here it is found <,> there is a word with prefixes <,> and
words without prefixes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#90:1:C>
So words without prefixes <,> as far as stress pattern is concerned
<,> they give a very chaotic picture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#91:1:C>
There is no pattern as such emerges <,,> when these words are
studied <,> but the word with prefixes you know they <,,> uh they maintain a
kind of uh stress pattern you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#92:1:C>
Of course there are <,> three divisions <,> under this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#93:1:C>
The first division <,> in the first division <,> uh the prefix
doesn't receive any stress as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#94:1:C>
But the remaining syllable <,> one of them does receive a primary
stress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#95:1:C>
The second category or the second division of words <,> that is
multi <,> syllabic words with prefixes <,> there <,> uh <,,> this prefixes
receive <,> primary stress <,,> and secondary stress <,> falls on some other
<,> uh syllable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#96:1:C>
And the third division is <,> uh where <,> the prefix receive the
secondary stress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#97:1:C>
And the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#98:1:C>
So the third type <,> there is a variant <,,> the prefix receive
the primary stress you know <,> it emerges as a pattern <,> in the speech of
educated Indian English speech <,> a speakers you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#99:1:C>
And here this pattern <,> it comes out or it can be regarded as <,>
or the particular stress pattern used by educated Indian <,> English speakers
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#100:1:C>
So this is the analysis <,> so <,> naturally the conclusions drawn
<,> conclusions reached at <,> so as far as duration is concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#101:1:C>
So <,,> the study says <,> uh this distinction between <,> short
and long <,> it is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#102:1:C>
The one reason why it is not very dominant <,> or dominantly <O>
one word </O> at the level of <,> again we can say <,,> listening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#103:1:C>
And the one reason is <,> it is uh due to <,> the mother tongue or
it is due to <,> uh the way we speak English <,> because whenever the speech
tempo <,> goes up or it increases <,> so our habit <,> that is the Marathi
speakers or even Indians you know <,> they pronounced most of the words
equally bold <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#104:1:C>
And because of this you know when the <,> tempo increases or goes
up <,> all the segments <,> including <,> vocalic and again we can say
consonants they get compressed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#105:1:C>
And because of this <,> this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments
you know and their duration it is not <,> felt very much <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#106:1:C>
But in other languages where <,> weak form <,> feature exists <,>
over there when <,> uh this tempo increases <,> or it again we can say <,>
the speaker speeds up himself <,> then he counters these weak forms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#107:1:C>
But he does not <,,> uh or his vocalic <,> uh parts of the vocalic
segments <,> and particularly stress <,> are stretched <,> stressed uh <,>
you see vowels <,> they are not affected to that extent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#108:1:C>
And so their duration remains <,> uh rather unaffected you know
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#109:1:C>
On the other hand <,> these vowels <,> that receive primary stress
<,> they are affected as far as <,> duration is concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#110:1:C>
Uh the next is <,> uh a dipthong <,> this area and here the
conclusions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#111:1:C>
The problem dipthong <,> taken up for the study <,> so it is said
that it is true <,> that these <,> all the three dipthongs <,> most of the
time they are pronounced as <,> pure vowels <,> and not as dipthongs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#112:1:C>
There are <,> news reader <,> or some news reader <,> who do
pronounce <,> dipthongs as dipthongs

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#113:1:C>
But their number is very low <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#114:1:C>
And since it is very low you know <,> and again the F two
transition that is not very much felt <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#115:1:C>
So this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent
you know <,> so it can't have <,> the central place in the conclusion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#116:1:C>
And the third is the stress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#117:1:C>
So according to me the stress <,> the secondary stress <,> or the
primary stress and the tertiary stress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#118:1:C>
The tertiary stress <,> this feature is not at all found in <,>
educated Indian English speech <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#119:1:C>
And the secondary stress and the primary stress <,> there is <-> a
</-> <,> again <+> a </+> kind of confusion <,> but some pattern does emerge
<,,> whenever it is a multisyllabic word <,> and that too again you know <,>
<-> which a <,> which is </-> <,> which has the prefix <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#120:1:C>
So another category of words <,> which is not multisyllable <,>
most of the time <,> but which has the functional stress in it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#121:1:C>
So the words with a functional stress <,> so the same word <,>
with a same <O> one word </O> shape which is used either or not <,> or a verb
you know <,> so they receive <,> a stress at different places <,> when they
change their grammatical categories <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#122:1:C>
So over here <,> all the news reader <,> that is educated Indian
English speakers you know <,> they very well maintained <,> this distinction
such as <,> now <O> two words </O> and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-076#123:1:C>
Here you know they emerges <,> again we can say very successful
speakers of educated Indian English speech <,,> </I>
