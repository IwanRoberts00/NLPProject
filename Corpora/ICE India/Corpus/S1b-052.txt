<I> <O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#1:1> Prof Sarin </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#2:1:A>
Then now the discussion that we are having <,,> really become
<,,> ritually <O> a few words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#3:1:A>
In the other house <,,> already <,,> the budget has got through <,,>
that is the ruling party has won <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#4:1:A>
Won means inspite of their <,> minority <,,> with their contrast
majority <,,> only because <,,> the <,,> total of the opposition <,,> was
unable to found hard <,,> on that contrast majority to break it through <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#5:1:A>
I just have known that <O> one or two words </O> be long to come
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#6:1:A>
But let us take the fact <,> as they are kept at the moment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#7:1:A>
It is because they are still there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#8:1:A>
We have discussed their budget <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#9:1:A>
It is their budget <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#10:1:A>
It is not the budget of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#11:1:A>
It is the budget of the Congress Party <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#12:1:A>
But <-> the </-> very truly I feel with that party is <,,> this <w>
party's </w> culture <,,> spins us around <,> personality cult <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#13:1:A>
Only one speaker <,,> whether I <,> I can agree with him or not <,>
talks on the <O> one or two words </O> <,,> but all others <,,> have <,,>
finished their speech <,,> with <O> one or two words </O> and through the
Prime Minister <,> and Finance minister in the bracket <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#14:1:A>
In that <O> one or two words </O> with that of <O> one or two words
</O> <,,> during the entire speech and <,,> I think <,,> what is more
revealing <,,> in this house <,,> such <,,> self-analysis <,,> that
introspectable <?> vioable </?> <,,> that in this country for the last forty
years <,,> we have been groping in the dark through a known path <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#15:1:A>
And now <,> a doctor has appeared <,,> with a magic lantern <,,>
with the blessings <,,> of the Prime Minister <,,> who hails <,> from the
region of Tirupathy or <O> one or two words </O> <,,> at least in that stage
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#16:1:A>
Today he is a <O> one or two words </O> <,,> self <O> one or two
words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#17:1:A>
This is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before <,,>
for which that they <O> one or two words </O> <,> and from which they draw
sustenance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#18:1:A>
From the name of Gandhiji <,> from the name of Nehru <,,> from the
name of Sardar Patel <,,> and <,,> all other freedom fighters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#19:1:A>
The Rajiv Gandhi of <,> of whom <,> they will now talk so much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#20:1:A>
So within these <,> forty years <,> forty or <,> as in free <,>
this ninety-one period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#21:1:A>
So all at <O> one or two words </O> I don't know what will happen
at Amethi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#22:1:A>
That is their internal affair <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#23:1:A>
But is <,,> such bretheren <,> is the idealogical foundation of the
ruling party of the great country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#24:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a woe <,> unto the total population of the country
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#25:1:A>
It is nice to break <O> one or two words </O> <,> almost by the
dual <O> one or two words </O> <,> it has no right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#26:1:A>
And now <,,> by inheriting that if demolishing it <,> even on which
<,,> on the foundation on which they stand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#27:1:A>
Then the question is <,> Mr vice <,> chairman <,,> what for <,,> we
should be thankful <,,> to the new mens era <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#28:1:A>
Either Dr Manmohan Singh or P V Narasimha Rao <,,> if the budget
that has been presented <,,> what is that <,,> what that ensure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#29:1:A>
That ensures <,,> that our foriegn exchange <,,> which we didn't
afford <,,> I M F loan or World Bank loan or A G B loan <,> or net loan
through other syndicates <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#30:1:A>
In the history of the world perhaps <,,> such shameless <,,>
acknowledgement <,> of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like
that <,> and showing it to be a strength of the economy <,> what do we found
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#31:1:A>
That these <,,> and <,> of late <,> our finance minister <,> went
<,,> in the one pack jumborie <,,> in order to ensure <,> three hundred <,,>
<indig> crores </indig> of dollor <O> one or two words </O> <,> for what <O>
one or two words </O> our all <O> one or two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#32:1:A>
And what else could he do <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#33:1:A>
He went <O> a few words </O> policy only involved that you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#34:1:A>
Under the pressure of <,,> U S A <O> one or two words </O> <,>
under the threat of this super three hundred one <,,> regarding which some
<O> a few words </O> takes place now and then <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#35:1:A>
In order <,> to <O> one or two words </O> the Duncan <,,> proposal
<,,> in order to steal ourselves <,,> for that <O> one or two words </O>
where Duncan proposals will be finalised <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#36:1:A>
What you mean then <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#37:1:A>
Our import duties had been reduced <,,> <O> one or two words </O>
and services have been reduced <,,> or totally done away with <,,> in order
to make <,,> import from <,,> advanced countries to developed countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#38:1:A>
To capture our market to victimise <-> of </-> <,> our indigenous
industry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#39:1:A>
Therefore <,> from whatever point of view <,> it may be looked into
<,> it enlarge <,> unqualified <,> proposition and <,,> unequivocal
condemnation

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#40:1:A>
I shall oppose <,> oppose this budget tooth and nail <,> <O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#41:1:A>
V Narayanswamy </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#42:1:B>
Yes madam please

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#43:1:C>
<O> one or two words </O> honourable Finance Minister

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#44:1:B>
<O> A few words </O> but he was not using

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#45:1:C>
While referring to <,,> the present day <,> birth situation on
the economic scenario <,,> made very clear and categorical assertion in his
majesty <,> which I like to put only two or three sentences <,> to <->
enlight your </-> enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#46:1:B>
<O> A few words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#47:1:C>
Madam <,> he says <,> the <O> a few words </O> very rapidly
<,,> becoming more integrated <,> at northern place and also more complicated
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#48:1:C>
Other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves
<,> to meet these challenges <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#49:1:C>
We cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to
be awkward <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#50:1:C>
This <O> a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#51:1:C>
Therefore madam the finance minister was very clear <,> in his mind
that with the <,> with the birth <,,> the economic situation is changing <,>
changing <,> changing rapidly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#52:1:C>
Liberation is taking place <,,> even in the communist country <,>
and not only that <,> they <O> one or two words </O> should become
competitive <,> in the field of production of various items including the
infrastructure industry <,,> consumer industry <,> and India should be in a
position to export <,> to other countries <,> various items

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#53:1:C>
In the International field India also should become <,> competent
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#54:1:C>
And also competitive <,> to get not the foriegn exchange <,> to
balance our economic situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#55:1:C>
Therefore madam several liberal liberal measures <,> <}> <-> for
</-> <+> to </+> </}> sort out on <O> one or two words </O> and which has
been taken by the present government <,> for the last two years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#56:1:C>
But that is the <,,> the <,,> the new schemes <,> and steps that
has been taken by the government <,> for the purpose of recouping the economy
<,,> that was established in the year nineteen ninety-one beginning <,,>
started <,,> yielding good results <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#57:1:C>
<}> <-> <.> Ma </.> </-> <=> Madam </=> </}> the <,> balance of
payments position <,> which was left at two thousand <indig> crores </indig>
<,> by the previous government now it has <,> come up to the level of <,>
eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight <indig>
crores </indig> <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#58:1:D>
On borrowed money <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-052#59:1:C>
No it is not borrowed money

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#60:1:C>
The borrowed money goes to investment <,,> which which one has to
accept <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#61:1:C>
Madam it is also a fact that <,,> <-> the <,> the our </-> <,,> our
limit of five point <,> nine million <,> as our foriegn exchange reserve <,>
we have not achieve

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#62:1:C>
One has <-> I have </-> to admit on that point and that aspect <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#63:1:C>
Therefore madam the government has taken <,,> various measures <,>
for the purpose of improving the economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#64:1:C>
And the finance minister <,,> who has taken a bold decision <,> to
bring reform <,> in in the <,> in the agriculture side <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#65:1:C>
Madam the thrust has been given for agriculture <,> in the in the
present budget by the finance minister <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#66:1:C>
And the outlay for the <,> <O> one or two words </O> agriculture
<,> <}> <-> <.> si </.> </-> <=> side </=> </}> <,> has been increased <,>
considerably <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#67:1:C>
The reason is that madam <,,> the agriculture is the poor sector
<,,> which is <,> the vital for the purpose of development of any country
especially <,> our country India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#68:1:C>
Madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the <,,>
the <,> bringing <,> the industries in the rural areas <,> the agro-based
industries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#69:1:C>
The agriculture <,> to be given all the emphasis <,> and also
support <,> by the <,> by the budget <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#70:1:C>
Therefore madam that the name <,> new agriculture policy <,> that
has been proposed <,,> by the government is going to give a thrust to it <,>
and the <,> it will pay therefore <,> lot of agro-based industries <,> to
come into this country in the rural areas <,> for the purpose of creating <,>
employment to the rural persons who are living in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#71:1:C>
Madam the industrial recession <,,> was there in the last year <,>
in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#72:1:C>
And not only the industrial recession in this country <,> it has
been throughout the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#73:1:C>
The <,> both the consumer items and also the infrastructure
industries <,> the production was less <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#74:1:C>
Even in the other country <,> but <-> the </-> <,> there is
recession total recession <,> and therefore the goods could not be marketed
<,> anywhere in our country and also abroad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#75:1:C>
Therefore madam <,> some changes have been brought by this
government <,> for the purpose of investment <,> and also especially in the
infrastructure side <,> so that to give <,> boost to the infrastructure
industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#76:1:C>
Madam in the banking sector <,,> which I would like to say only <,>
a few lines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#77:1:C>
Uh the it is a <O> one word </O> the nation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#78:1:C>
Now <,> several lakhs of <indig> rupees </indig> have been <,,> in
the security scam <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#79:1:C>
Several banks have been involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#80:1:C>
Several <,> <-> the </-> executives of the banks have been <,> <O>
one or two words </O> <,> and also some of the officers have been arrested
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#81:1:C>
And C B I is <O> one or two words </O> investigating into the
matter <,> and not only that <,> our parliamentary committee is also <,>
going into the security scam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#82:1:C>
Madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand <,>
two hundred <indig> crores </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#83:1:C>
Madam this <,> this security scam <,,> has only shaken the <,> the
banking system in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#84:1:C>
And that the banks <,> have indiscriminately invested in the <,> in
that say scam <O> one word </O> <,,> without the approval of the government
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#85:1:C>
And also <,> bring the <O> one or two words </O> <,,> and thereby
the finance minister has to undertake <,> ten thousand <indig> crores
</indig> <,> for the purpose of <,,> <-> the </-> giving <,> the
manufacturing bank <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#86:1:C>
Madam the honourable <-> the </-> minister for banking is also
sitting here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#87:1:C>
Then who is affected today <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#88:1:C>
It is the farmer who is affected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#89:1:C>
It is the farm industrial products who are affected <,,> not the
<O> one or two words </O> <,> not the stock brokers <,> it is only the people
who are genuinely working for the development of this country <,> they are
affected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#90:1:C>
And the <-> loan are </-> loans are not being given to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#91:1:C>
Even madam see <,> when the previously when Congress government
there <,> there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people
loans <O> one word </O> scheme was there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#92:1:C>
And it was giving benefit to the <,> small people agriculturist <,>
and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#93:1:C>
And <,> and also from labourers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#94:1:C>
Today what is happening <,> they are not in a position to go to the
bank <,> they are not able to <,> enter into the bank today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#95:1:C>
The reason is that <,> that the B J P government came here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#96:1:C>
They have completely closed the door <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#97:1:C>
Thereafter <O> one or two words </O> security scam after security
scam <,> the banking officials <,> they are not allowing the agriculturists
to enter into the bank <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#98:1:C>
This is a very serious matter Mr minister <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#99:1:C>
The Indira Gandhi our honourable former Prime Minister has taken up
<,> Nationalisation of the bank <,> is only for the purpose of giving benefit
to the poor people <,> downtrodden <,> schedule caste and schedule tribe
agriculture <O> a few words </O> agriculturists <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#100:1:C>
And madam <,> I feel there is a <O> one or two words </O> method
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#101:1:C>
In the banking division <,> we don't <O> one or two words </O>
people there honestly repay the amount <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#102:1:C>
It is the big industrialist <,> who have siphoned out ten thousand
<indig> crores </indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> <,> who have not paid that
money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#103:1:C>
But it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money <,> and
those people <O> a few words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#104:1:C>
And not only that <,> for only capital <,> small-scale
industrialists <,> who are <,> who are suffering today <,> the reason is that
the banks banks have completely closed down

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#105:1:C>
They have not <,> allowed the small scale industries also to come
for the working capital <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#106:1:C>
They say <O> one or two words </O> the security scam is being
investigated <,> they have not received any direction from the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#107:1:C>
Therefore they will not give you the loan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#108:1:C>
Therefore madam the production in the small-scale <}> <-> <.> sec
</.> </-> <=> sector </=> </}> is going down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#109:1:C>
Madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the
export in this conutry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#110:1:C>
It is not the big industry it is not the <,> middle <,> middle
industry <,> it is only small scale industry that is contributing <,> for
large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector
<,> because they are not providing loans to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#111:1:C>
Therefore the honourable <,> minister Venkatrajan minister who is
sitting here <,> I request him <,> to deal with seriously <,> call all the
<-> bank </-> banking officers <,> give a direction to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#112:1:C>
Normal banking activity should start <,,> otherwise our production
in this country <,> will go down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#113:1:C>
And also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be
suffering <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#114:1:C>
The another area there <,> honourable finance minister has to
concentrate <,> is black money <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#115:1:C>
More than eighty thousand <indig> crores </indig> of <indig>
rupees </indig> is in the form of black money <,,> <O> interruption </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#116:1:C>
Madam that black money has to be brought down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#117:1:C>
Which should be brought out which is now hidden <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#118:1:C>
That is to be done <,> various schemes have been brought <,,> then
they bringing fund from Madras <,> the government will not ask the account
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#119:1:C>
Now where was scheme that we brought <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#120:1:C>
What is the total amount if you have <,> recovered if you have
brought out of it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#121:1:C>
It is not even <,> more than seven percent <,,> out of eighty
thousand <indig> crores </indig> not even seven percent of the money has come
out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#122:1:C>
What is the scheme you have <,> to bring the black money out <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#123:1:C>
So that the inflation will not be there <,> and there will be a
balance economy <,> and and and the people and the budget which you have been
presenting in the <,> country is imperfect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#124:1:C>
Madam the <,,> only <,> madam the <,> novel provision is for the
small scale industry <,> especially <,,> the people who are <,> <w> who'll
</w> be having small industry <,> have been given the benefit <,> and it is a
laudable measure that has been taken <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#125:1:C>
And madam in our state though it is small state <,> having more
than <,> only ten lakh population <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#126:1:C>
In in our <,> town limit alone <,> we have more than <,> four
hundred small units <,> which are manufacturing <O> one word </O> <,,> which
are to be sold one <indig> rupee </indig> <,,> and even a common man goes and
gets it and he is using it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#127:1:C>
And there are madam <w> it's </w> a big lobby <,> is working in
this country <,,> to curtail that industry <,> for the simple reason that
these <,> giants and multinationals they are trying to <,> see that these
industries are closed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#128:1:C>
Madam the <,> the <O> one word </O> government has taken a
decision <,> low duty duty will be imposed on this item <,> and the turnover
has been increased to <,> thirty lakhs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#129:1:C>
It is a right decision has been taken by the government <,> on the
representation given by those people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#130:1:C>
But madam the lobby that is working the multinational <,> who who
are in this country <,> they are trying to kill those industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#131:1:C>
And madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment
to more than <,> ten thousand people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#132:1:C>
The the people who are involved in the production <,> people who
are involved in the marketing <,> ten thousand people are getting the benefit

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#133:1:C>
Not only that <,> the people who are using it are <O> a few words
</O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-052#134:1:C>
Therefore madam <,> this budget <,,> I feel that it is a growth
oriented budget <,,> it is a common <w> man's </w> budget <,> </I>
