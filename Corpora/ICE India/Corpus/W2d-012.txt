<bold> <smallcaps> OTHER </smallcaps> </bold> than the epics, <bold>
<mention> Mahabharat </mention> </bold> and <bold> <mention> Ramayan
</mention> </bold> , no other piece of literature had as much impact on the
cultural life of the people of India as did <w> Jayadeva's </w> <bold>
<mention> Gita Govinda </mention> </bold> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#3:1>
Written in the twelfth century in Eastern India, this dramatic,
lyrical poem was already known in Western India by the end of the thirteenth
century.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#4:1>
In the years to follow it was to become popular all over the country.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#5:1>
It influenced Indian religious literature, poetry, music, dance,
theatre and the plastic arts as no other book had done.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#6:1>
Its special relevance to dance is traced to the fact that it was sung
and danced as mandatory ritual in the Jagannath temple at Puri as early as
1278 A. D. as decreed by the king, Narasimha Deva.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#7:1>
Scholar J. P. Das notes that this practice was endorsed even more
strictly by his successor, Raja Prataprudra by means of a stone
inscription in 1500 A. D.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#8:1>
This ordered that the troupes of dancing girls allowed to perform in
the temples would learn no other song and perform to no text other than the
<bold> Gita Govinda </bold> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#9:1>
<quote> " If any temple functionary allows any other song or dance to
be performed, be it known that he is a traitor to Jagannath." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#10:1>
One wishes some such directive had been given to the soloists who
took the floor on the second day of the <quote> " Gita Govinda" </quote>
festival at Kamani organised by The Centre for Indian Classical Dances
and VST Industries in their ongoing <mention> The Spirit of Freedom
Concerts </mention> this week.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#11:1>
It would have maintained the conceptual clarity and vigour that
was evident on the first day, a kind of dance theatre on the full text
performed in three classical styles, Odissi by Sonal Mansingh,
Bharatnatyam by Laxmi Vishwanathan and Kathakali by Sadanam Balakrishnan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#12:1>
The four styles presented on the second day lost sight of the main
focus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#13:1>
The dramatic structure of the <bold> Gita Govinda </bold> , a
cast of three main characters, viz. Krishna, Radha and the <indig> Sakhi
</indig> and a time span of a little more than two days, was tailor-made for
Sonal, Laxmi and Sadanam even though the styles are not.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#14:1>
The Kathakali Krishna is a far cry from the usual <indig>
Shringara- </indig> laden Krishnas we see in the other forms.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#15:1>
And initially the awakwardness felt by Balakrishnan when Sonal
addressed to him love plaints like the immortal <quote> " Kuru
Yadunandana" </quote> transmitted itself across the boards to the viewer.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#16:1>
But luckily such moments were few and far in between.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#17:1>
What mattered was the excellent use of space by the three, alone, in
duets or together.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#18:1>
As against <w> Kathakali's </w> stress on drama and <indig> abhinaya
</indig> to the word, Odissi steps into the very well-spring of <indig>
<quote> " bhava" </quote> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#19:1>
Here Sonal was not only the archetypal Radha, sullen, sulking and
finally sublimationally sorrowful but she kept her <indig> abhinaya </indig>
distinct from that of <w> Laxmi's </w> , herself a superb example of
controlled mime.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#20:1>
Success belonged to the evening because on one element or person
tried to monopolise it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#21:1>
With each line of the <indig> <bold> Kavya </bold> </indig> , sung by
the three different orchestras with only the Kathakali drums remaining
midstream throughout, the slim story got fleshd out appropriately.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#22:1>
The little masterpiece starts with the words of Nanda, pointing to
the sky dark with clouds and the <indig> Tamla </indig> trees that
overhang the forest and make the night menacing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#23:1>
He orders Radha to take Krishna home.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#24:1>
Thus starts an odyssey of love and desire, <quote> " their secret
passion triumphing on the banks of the river Yamuna" </quote> followed by
separation and misunderstanding.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#25:1>
Like the tireless <indig> Sakhi </indig> , we, the audience, too,
are buffeted from Radha to Krishna and back again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#26:1>
Like her, we too are relieved when they are finally united and
after a night of love Radha asks her lower to <quote> " Paint my breast with
leaf designs/Put colour on my cheeks/Fasten the girdle around my hips"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#27:1>
And on Wednesday the fine music, the aesthetical matching of
different styles and the tasteful use of sensuousness made the unending
controversies over the erotica in the poetics and rhetorics of the
<bold> Gita Govinda </bold> , the <indig> Atma-Parmatama </indig> angle as
against the straightforward love poetry of Jayadeva, quite immaterial. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#28:1>
If the second day, then, featuring a bevy of young dancers doing
an obligatory <indig> ashtapadi </indig> and then back to business as
usual didn't quite impress the reason is obvious.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#29:1>
Something like the Amrushatakam experiment would have helped bring
out the comparisons and contrasts of the different styles and dancers better.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#30:1>
Within that observation, Ram <w> Mohan's </w> Kathak, Vijayalaxmi <w>
Shivaji's </w> Mohiniattam and <w> Shashikala's </w> Kuchipudi showed each
one as a master or mistress of the chosen form. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#31:1>
Earlier, the first ever Maori dance troupe from New Zealand
saddened one by pinpointing what happens when living cultures are reduced to
sharpnels of <indig> <quote> " Tamashbeeni" </quote> </indig> , something
prepaid and packaged for export consumption.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#32:1>
Even in their present highly sanitised form, the Maoris gave a
glimpse of their rich culture, its stress on muscular and cerebral
coordination, a prime facet of early <w> man's </w> life, juggling balls
and pom-poms, sticks and banners with native dexterity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#33:1>
It helped one forget the mechanical parts. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#38:2>
Yet, within the space of a few years, it has created a sound image
for its programmes.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#39:2>
There is much talk about merit these days.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#40:2>
Alas, it is limited to the academic world and few recognise the
thoughtless way in which media blows up stereotyped images, largely of
mediocrity, in the cultural field.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#41:2>
The meritorious young are excluded from the celebrity spectacles
which big <}> <-> bui-ness </-> <+> business </+> </}> firms sponsor
precisely because as yet they have no name.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#42:2>
But there lies the rub.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#43:2>
As prem Shankar Jha, writing on the subject asks: <quote> " Where
then does the budding musician or dancer of the next generation perform?

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#44:2>
How does he or she build a reputation so that one day he or she too
can join the gilded band of celebrities?

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#45:2>
And if they cannot be sure of a steady living and an equally
steady rise to prominence in step with their own growing maturity, why should
they remain in the arts at all?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#46:2>
That is the kind of vacuum that New Artistes Forum is trying to
fill and by bringing Priyardarshini Govind from Madras to the city for a
Bharatnatyam recital on Sunday, at India International Centre, it earned
itself a rare bouquet of praise.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#47:2>
So what is so special about this young, tall, slim, Malavika
Sarrukai-look alike?

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#48:2>
Everything.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#49:2>
For one thing her <indig> Nritta </indig> is amazingly impeccable.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#50:2>
For another, she has the most complete grasp of <indig> <bold>
Satvikabhinaya </bold> </indig> that one has seen in her generation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#51:2>
No wonder her <indig> abhinaya guru </indig> , Kalanidhi Narayanan
swears by her.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#52:2>
On Sunday she was competently accompanied by her other <indig> guru
</indig> , S. K. Rajaratnam, who has provided the foundation of her excellent
technique.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#53:2>
Vocal support was by Vijayalakshmi and <indig> mridangam </indig> by
P. Kannan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#54:2>
Taking each and every item of a traditional repertoire, from
the <indig> Varnam </indig> to the <indig> Tillana </indig> , a composition
of Lalgudi Jayaraman, she showed her class by making it appear so fresh,
so vibrant and so aesthetically perfect as to immediately make one sit up.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#55:2>
Even her <bold> Praveshiki </bold> and her exits had a stamp of
assurance that prepared the viewer for the way in which she framed each
<indig> adavu </indig> and <indig> teermanam </indig> in the perfect
spatial sense.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#56:2>
For instance, the <indig> <bold> Paiccal </bold> adavu </indig> in
her hands had an ethereal lightness as the body jumped, leapt and then
returned to the <indig> Mandala Sthana </indig> without veering a micro point
from the correctness of the left hand in the <bold> Katamukha </bold>
position, the right curving in the <indig> Alapadma </indig> position
before the foot landed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#57:2>
And the repeats in all directions were equally perfect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#58:2>
And to say that her <indig> abhinaya </indig> scored over her
<indig> Nritta </indig> is only to repeat onself.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#59:2>
The <indig> Padam </indig> in <indig> Saveri </indig> , in which the
<indig> Nayika </indig> sends the <indig> Dooti </indig> with her love
message, followed by the <indig> Jhaveli </indig> in which she realises that
both her friend and confidante and her lover have doublecrossed her, were
every inch the proper and fit vehicles of expression of an <indig> Uttama
Nayika </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#60:2>
The emotion was subtle and yet strong, the <indig> <bold>
netrabhinaya </bold> </indig> so intense as to travel across the
proscenium stage and into far corners of the hall.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#61:2>
The <indig> Krishnakarnamrita Shlokas </indig> in <indig> Jog
Kauns, Hamsanandi, Kalavati </indig> and <indig> Sindhu Bhairavi </indig>
presented <indig> Vatsalaya </indig> and <indig> Shringara Rasas </indig>
in an unusual shading.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#62:2>
The <indig> Tillana </indig> brougt the concert to a most fulfilling
end, a point at which the young <w> dancer's </w> costume was like a wet
sheath, for there had been no break for costume change, but the audience felt
a warm glow at the thought that the future of our arts was safe even if there
are a handful of young dancers like priyadarshini Govind around. </p> </I>

<bold> <smallcaps> RITUALISTIC </smallcaps> </bold> , esoteric, plain
gymnastic - - the folk dances of India are all this and more.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#65:3>
In their journey to the 20th century from the days of the Sanskrit
theatre, much may have been lost.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#66:3>
Far more surprising, however, is the amount that has been retained,
from the convention of the <indig> <it> Indradhvaja purva-ranga </it>
</indig> , be it <w> Gujrat's </w> <indig> Bhavai </indig> or <w> Punjab's
</w> <indig> Naqqal </indig> , to the clearly discernible, if <}> <-> lonly
</-> <+> only </+> </}> roughly similar, zonal divisions <indig> <it> (
Kaksavibhaga) </it> </indig> of the Sanskrit stage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#67:3>
Also the same is the use of the <indig> <it> Sutradhara </it>
</indig> and the <indig> <it> Vidusaka </it> </indig> , linking the many
plots of the performance, providing the chorus and interpreting the earthy
concerns of the present in the light of the encouragingly similar squabbles
and pursuits of the gods.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#68:3>
Traditionally they have done this with innovative strength and bold
unconcern for stepping on the toes of the great and the mighty. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#69:3>
But if Prem Chand Naqqal and <w> Group's </w> <indig> <it> Stree
Veshas </it> </indig> had vigorous dancing by the all-men cast as well as
some sharp comment by the singer - - <indig> Vidusaka </indig> , its tawdry
use of wigs and falsies et al was largely symptomatic of the declining level
of aesthetics as witnessed in this <w> year's </w> <indig> Lok Utsav
</indig> organised annually by the <indig> Sangeet Natak </indig> Akademy
since 1984.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#70:3>
Despite the enthusiastic house-fulls that came to the open-air
Rabindra Bhavan stage to watch performers from all parts of India, there
was a tired and mechanistic air about both the artistes and the organisers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#71:3>
It seemed like yet another ritual to be gone through on the
calendar, without any effort to enable the media to go a bit deeper into
the background of the participants through a Press conference or fuller
programme notes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#72:3>
Even within a form, let alone the performers, there was much
unevenness.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#73:3>
Thus excellent <indig> Mappilappattu </indig> singing marked the
monotonous dancing by the Kozhikode Mappila Kala Academy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#74:3>
The form was <indig> Oppana </indig> , a marriage ritual dance of the
northern Malabar region of Kerala.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#75:3>
Its curiosity value, of course, lay in the fact that it is a dance of
the Muslims and uses clapping and gently swaying movements of the women in
a circular formation with the bride-to-be seated in the centre. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#76:3>
As before, the surprise lay in the variations on the theme of
martial art exercises and gymnastics that slowly evolve into stylised dance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#77:3>
The <indig> <it> paikakhadas </it> </indig> of villages in Orissa,
performed by the <indig> Birupakshi Paik Akhada </indig> was a
throwback to the days of the peasant militia under the command of the kings
of Orissa.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#78:3>
At its core lies physical culture and <indig> <it> akhada </indig> -
style </it> gymnastics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#79:3>
Very similar to the <indig> Thang Ta </indig> of Manipur was the way
they used the stick or the <indig> lath </indig> to slice a gourd placed on
the <w> opponent's </w> chest or - - its more suspenseful variation - - crack
a coconut balanced on the <quote> " <w> enemy's </w> " </quote> head. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#80:3>
From somersaults to using each <O> Photograph </O> <O> caption -
- Geeta Chandran - - Photo by Avinash Pasricha </O> <w> other's </w> body as
ladders, the group had a lot in its repertory.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#81:3>
But at the end of it, one had the distinct feeling that some members
had been roped in at the last minute.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#82:3>
The Dangi dance, by Shivaji Kapru Bhoye and his group, made good use
of the <indig> Kahalya </indig> and the <indig> Dholki </indig> for its
rhythmic and figurative patterns.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#83:3>
Both here and in the <indig> PaikaAkhada </indig> forms, there is
interesting use of circular and pyramidic formations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#84:3>
Quite different in every way is the traditional <indig> Perini
Shiva Thandavam </indig> form, on the borderline of classical and folk.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#85:3>
With the accompaniment of excellent singing, the four dancers gave
a rousing display of their foot-work and animated use of the body, as in
Kuchipudi.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#86:3>
On the other hand, the <indig> Veeragasse </indig> , by Basavaraj
Nellisaera and party was mechanistic in the stance and thrust, despite the
large size of the contingent.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#87:3>
And the use of Ambassador car hubcaps as <quote> " shields"
</quote> , with handles welded in, were part of <w> today's </w> scenario of
lack of attention to detail. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-012#88:3>
For lack of space last week the notice of Geeta <w> Chandran's
</w> performance at IIC on the occasion of Papanasan <w> Sivan's </w>
birth centenary, had to be omitted.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#89:3>
Geeta performed a full Bharat Natyam repertoire on the <w> poet's
</w> work.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#90:3>
This of course, is always more of a handicap than an aid.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#91:3>
Dance has a multitude of emotional hues and saint poets like
Pappanasan Sivan rarely allow the dancer to move out of the restricted space
of <indig> Bhakti Rasa </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#92:3>
If despite this, Geeta impressed, specially in the
architectonically constructed <indig> Varnam </indig> in Sivaranjani, it was
due to the hard work put in by her of late.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#93:3>
And that contributed by her <indig> guru </indig> , K. N.
Dakshinamoorthy of the great <indig> Dandayudhapani Pillai </indig>
tradition.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#94:3>
One grouse one had with the programme was Geeta setting herself too
complex and severe a challenge in the <indig> jathi </indig> passages.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#95:3>
While she performed them correctly enough, the stress of doing too
much right takes away from the relaxed <indig> <it> ananda </it> </indig>
that dance must communicate.

<ICE-IND:W2D-012#96:3>
Akhila Krishnan, <indig> guru </indig> Dakshinamoorthy and Bejanki
Krishna along with Raghu on the flute gave fine support. </p> </I>
