<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-058#1:1:A>
I first became interested in fabric painting when I saw <,,> it
<,> advertised in a magazine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#2:1:A>
So I went out and got a whole lot of colours <,,> and uhm <,,> I
first started out by <,,> painting on pieces of <.> pa </.> <,> on pieces of
uh <,> cloth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#3:1:A>
I took the designs from <,> magazines <,> from uhm <,,> cards <,,>
and uh <,> sometimes I just used my own free style design <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#4:1:A>
Then uhm <,,> I started uh <,> painting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#5:1:A>
Now <,> this is a pillow case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#6:1:A>
<w> I've </w> done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric
paints

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#7:1:A>
In the beginning I diluted it very thickly <,,> didn't use much
water

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#8:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> come a bit crudely <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#9:1:A>
It hasn't come very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#10:1:A>
So uhm <,> I decided to dilute the paint <,,> a little more <,,>
and make the colour more refined <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#11:1:A>
Now I use all sorts of colours <,,> like <,> blue green yellow <,,>
violet indigo <,> black <,,> white on black <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#12:1:A>
You can use any colour on any kind of cloth <,,> and the results
are fantastic

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#13:1:A>
Now have a look at this bedsheet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#14:1:A>
This is something I tried <,> quite recently <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#15:1:A>
This is a mixture of all sorts of <,,> ideas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#16:1:A>
<w> I've </w> taken <w> it's </w> some kind of ink freaking <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#17:1:A>
You can do the same sort of thing on paper

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#18:1:A>
Take a piece of string <,> dip it in ink <,,> put it between two
pieces of paper <,,> flatten <-> it </-> <,,> the paper <,,> and pull it out
slowly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#19:1:A>
Now the same <,,> idea has been applied on this bedsheet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#20:1:A>
But the <,> string I have taken is slightly thicker <,,> and I have
streaked the bedsheet all over <,,> and then <,> the results that you can see
are fantastic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#21:1:A>
It has given it a very printed kind of look <,> and uhm <,> very
professional <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#22:1:A>
And not only that I spray painted <,> all over the bedsheet <,>
with different colours <,,> and <w> I've </w> used enough stensils <,> to
mark a <}> <-> <.> ki </.> </-> <,> <=> kind </=> </}> of outline all round
the end of the bedsheet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#23:1:A>
So uhm <,,> the effect is quite good actually <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#24:1:A>
Now uh <,> this was just a trial actually starting with sort of
bedsheet <,,> because bedsheets aren't very expensive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#25:1:A>
Now here is another piece of cloth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#26:1:A>
This is a dress material <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#27:1:A>
I have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric
painting on dress material <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#28:1:A>
I have done the same sort of thing but <w> I've </w> used <,,> uhm
<,> cut out moulds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#29:1:A>
The moulds are potatoes <,,> and ladysfingers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#30:1:A>
These can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all
over the material <,> and <w> I've </w> also spray painted the material <,>
and streaked it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#31:1:A>
You can even draw your own little stars here and there and <,,> see
like this <,,> and uhm <,,> the results are quite <,,> good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#32:1:A>
Now all that has to be done with this material <,> is to be cut out
and sewn into a dress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#33:1:A>
I still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet <,,> but uh <,>
once I do it the results are good enough I am going to start selling them
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#34:1:A>
And I am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of
stuff because its quite original <,,> and I don't think anyone has quite
tried this sort of thing before <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#35:1:A>
You can do almost anything with fabric painting

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#36:1:A>
You can paint curtains <,,> you can paint bedsheets <,,> you can
paint <,> uhm <,,> dress-material <,,> handkerchiefs <,,> pillow covers <,,>
table-cloths <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#37:1:A>
All sorts of things you use around the house even <,,> like uhm <,>
just little designs <,> wall designs to hang on the walls <,,> and anything
else you fancy actually <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#38:1:A>
Uhm <,,> so uh <,,> fabric painting <,,> is <,> fast becoming quite
popular <,,> especially for curtains and other things used around the house

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#39:1:A>
But <,,> this is the first time I am trying fabric painting on
dresses <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#40:1:A>
People have tried it before on uh <,> T-shirts <,,> and uhm <,>
other things but I am going to start something new now I am going to start
fabric painting on Jeans <,,> and <,,> other articles which haven't been
painted so far <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#41:1:A>
Now uhm <,> this is a pair of Jeans <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#42:1:A>
The modern trend is not to wear Jeans that are flawlessly clean
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#43:1:A>
But rather <,,> to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints
and uh <,> patches <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#44:1:A>
In other words <,,> Jeans are <,> fashionably dirty these days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#45:1:A>
People prefer to wear them dirty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#46:1:A>
Now instead of making Jeans dirty <,,> I think a better idea would
be to paint the dirt on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#47:1:A>
But not exactly paint the dirt on <,,> we would rather paint
patches on <,> or paint little things on it <,,> or even use stensils <,> or
potatoes and ladysfingers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#48:1:A>
You won't believe that a pair of Jeans could be made to look like
this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#49:1:A>
Now this looks <,,> as though <,,> it has been done in a factory
<,,> and uh <,> I have tried selling a few of these dress <,> and few of this
<,> some of the dress-material before and uhm <,,> the prices are <,> people
are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#50:1:A>
They don't get this kind of print <,> on material which they can
buy <,> which they buy in the shop <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#51:1:A>
And uhm <,,> well they are willing to pay quite well for it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#52:1:A>
Now <,,> these are some curtains <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#53:1:A>
I have hung them up in my bedroom here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#54:1:A>
See how the <,> outline has been carefully sketched <,,> on to the
curtains first <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#55:1:A>
These are not quite finished <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#56:1:A>
But the outline has been sketched <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#57:1:A>
Now what I have to do <,,> is yes <,> since <w> it's </w> been done
with carbon paper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#58:1:A>
Now uhm <,> I have to <,> paint <,,> the outline <,> and then <,>
paint it in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#59:1:A>
I also get ideas for my designs <,,> from <,> a monthly
subscription <,,> for <,,> a magazine <,> they send pamphlets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#60:1:A>
Small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to
<,> fabric painting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#61:1:A>
And the designs are quite originals in them

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#62:1:A>
You can draw animals <,> or flowers <,> or just abstract designs
<,> you can spray paint <,> you can use strings of <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#63:1:A>
If you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#64:1:A>
Now <,> here is another thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#65:1:A>
Here is a bag <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#66:1:A>
This handbag <,> is made of denim <,,> and it has been painted <,,>
with fabric paints <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#67:1:A>
There are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#68:1:A>
They are camlin <.> wat </.> <,> uh <,> they are not exactly water
colours <,,> they are fevicraft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#69:1:A>
They are called fevicraft colours <,,> and they are available in a
wide range of colours <,> they should be diluted quite a bit <,,> and you can
paint <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#70:1:A>
See how I have done this bag <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#71:1:A>
The result is <,,> astonishing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#72:1:A>
Not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth <,,> but you
can also paint <,> vessels <,> infact anything that you use around the house
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#73:1:A>
You can paint practically anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#74:1:A>
You can paint claypots <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#75:1:A>
You can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even <,,> Egyptian
designs like the old Egyptian urns <,,> Greek designs like Graceo urns <,,>
and uhm <,,> they will make wonderful ornaments put all over the house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#76:1:A>
Then uhm <,,> some people <,,> <}> <-> <.> so </.> </-> <,> <=>
some </=> </}> people just come and ask me to paint things <,,> on any object
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#77:1:A>
They bring either <,> pieces of cloths or <,> some <}> <-> a <.>
pie </.> </-> <=> a piece </=> </}> of cloth they want to make into something
or <,,> any sort of cloth actually plus different sorts of articles <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#78:1:A>
You can even paint uh <,> vehicles like bikes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#79:1:A>
You can do all sorts of designs on a bike <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#80:1:A>
And uhm <,,> this is becoming quite <,,> a fad these days with the
younger generation specially people in colleges <,,> because they go in for
all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other
things <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#81:1:A>
And fabric painting <,,> happens to stay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#82:1:A>
It stays on bike for a much longer time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#83:1:A>
It doesn't come off like a sticker <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#84:1:A>
Not only can you do fabric painting on all these things <,,> you
can also paint canvas shoes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#85:1:A>
You will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas
shoes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#86:1:A>
You can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#87:1:A>
You can make them look very trendy and very fashionable <,,> by <,>
painting almost anything on them from your relations <,> to all sorts of
exotic designs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#88:1:A>
You can paint towels <,,> skirts <,> jackets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#89:1:A>
Denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#90:1:A>
People go in for all sorts of things <,> written on the back of
their denim jackets

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#91:1:A>
Here is one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#92:1:A>
This one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#93:1:A>
So I have painted it the way that person wanted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#94:1:A>
I take orders sometimes <,,> but mainly I use my own imaginations
<,,> and <,,> I normally do <,,> exactly as I feel like

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#95:1:A>
I let my <,> imagination run wild sometimes <,> and the results are
usually very good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#96:1:A>
They are impressive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#97:1:A>
And lot of people like my work <,,> and uhm <,> here all the things
in front of you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#98:1:A>
<w> It's </w> quite an array here <,,> and uhm <,,> <w> it's </w>
<,,> these are most of the things you can uh <,> use fabric paints on <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#99:1:A>
I am sure <,,> other people with good imaginations can think of
many more things from fabric paints <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#100:1:A>
And uhm <,,> <w> that's </w> about it <,> the fabric paints <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#101:1:A>
So this is how fabric paints can be used <,,> </I>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#102:2:A>
Hello there <,> <w> today's </w> topic <,> home-made
cosmetics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#103:2:A>
Out of the fifty or more cosmetics that are available today <,> we
have selected a few for your preparations at home <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#104:2:A>
The accent has been on easy availability <,> and processing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#105:2:A>
Please have your books and pens ready <,> so that you can note
down the formulae and procedure that are going to be flashed up on to the
screen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#106:2:A>
Follow the safety precautions to the best of your ability <,> so
that you can get serviceable and usable material <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#107:2:A>
Many people say <,> the use of cosmetics is a luxury <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#108:2:A>
Others are equally voceferous <,> that it is important for
personality development and <}> <-> <.> en </.> </-> <,> <=> enhancement </=>
</}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#109:2:A>
We leave it to you to decide <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#110:2:A>
But <,> have your books and pens ready <,> and for your
information <,> cosmetics is derived from the Greek word <foreign> cosmeticos
</foreign> meaning skill in decorating <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#111:2:A>
Another meaning for the word cosmos is ornament <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#112:2:A>
And as you know <,> cosmos also means the whole universe

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#113:2:A>
So <,> the supporters of cosmetics say <,> that the scope is wide
ranging and far reaching <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#114:2:A>
Now professor Sai Prakash <,> will tell you <,> more about this
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-058#115:2:B>
Let us start with the first procedure <,> of preparing a
cleansing cream <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#116:2:B>
Historically <,,> one of the earliest creams was prepared by <?>
jaily </?> <,> around the year one thirty-two hundred A D <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#117:2:B>
And he was one of the <,> famous physicians of that particular
time next only to Hippocritis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#118:2:B>
His cooling ointment <,,> called <,> Serateem <,> refrigeran <,,>
they call into a present <,,> cleansing cream <,> has the basic ingredient
<,> bees wax <,> olive olive oil <,,> rose water etcetera <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#119:2:B>
And <,> the combination of this cleansing cream <,> even to this
day <,> is almost similar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#120:2:B>
In chart one you have <,> the basic ingredients <,,> present in a
cleansing cream <,,> like bees wax <,,> mineral oil <,,> or vegetable oil as
given in part B of the chart <,> water <,,> and borax <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#121:2:B>
These are the ingredients <,> with which you can prepare uh <,> a
simple cleansing cream <,> at home <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#122:2:B>
And <,,> the purpose of this <,,> <}> <-> <.> pa </.> </-> <=>
particular </=> </}> cleansing cream is to <,> remove <,,> oil grime <,>
facial make-up etcetera from face <,,> or throat <,,> or other parts of the
body <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#123:2:B>
And <,,> other creams such as uh <,> vanishing cream <,> hand
cream <,> or <O> one word </O> creams are prepared <,> with this basic
formulation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#124:2:B>
We have the method of preparation <,,> in the flow diagram given
in chart two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#125:2:B>
And uh <,,> in the <,> chart you see <,,> that we have uh <,> bees
wax <,,> and mineral oil taken together <,,> melted and heated upto seventy
degree <,> so that the wax melts and we have <,> a homogeneous solution <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#126:2:B>
Borax taken in water <,> dissolved in water <,> and once again
heated to seventy degree so that <,> both these reacting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#127:2:B>
Bees wax in mineral oil <,> Borax in water are at seventy degree
<,> and they are mixed up slowly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#128:2:B>
Borax <,> in water being added to this <,> bees wax oil
composition slowly with continuous stirring <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#129:2:B>
And <,> when all the ingredient has been added <,,> you <,> stir
vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#130:2:B>
When it comes to around fifty degrees or so <,> you add uh <,> uh
perfume of your choice <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#131:2:B>
<w> It's </w> because <,,> one has to be very selective in adding
<,> perfume because <,> the choice varies from person to person <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#132:2:B>
A suitable <,> perfume can be added <,> and then the temperature
brought down <,> further <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#133:2:B>
At this stage you see that <,> the whole thing <,> emulsifies <,>
and you get the <,> cold or <O> one word </O> cream of your choice <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#134:2:B>
Now the procedure is very simple and uh <,> we will be doing that
particular experiment now <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#135:2:B>
Here we have bees wax <,,> it is <,> made into small chips <,> uhm
<,,> when it is marketed <w> it's </w> <,> of this particular shape <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#136:2:B>
This is done to <,> see that it <,> melts easily <,> and this has
this has got to be <,> dissolved in mineral oil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#137:2:B>
Here is the mineral oil sample <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#138:2:B>
I am going to <,> pour this into a beaker <,,> and uh <,> the
quantities are as given in the chart <,> the same poportion being taken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#139:2:B>
This is the <,> mineral oil transfered into a beaker <,> and then
<,> the beas wax <,,> is crushed into this utensil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#140:2:B>
And uh <,> we have a <,,> set up <,,> of uh <,,> <w> I'll </w>
take it out with the help of a glassrod <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#141:2:B>
After tranfering <,> bees wax into mineral oil <,,> we now take
<,,> borax <,,> and <,,> dissolve it in the <.> wa </.> <,> dissolve it in
water for <,,> according to the quantities given <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#142:2:B>
And then <,,> heat these two ingredients <,> to seventy degrees
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#143:2:B>
And I have the set up here <,> the heater and then <,,> uh water
inside and that water is getting heated up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#144:2:B>
I now transfer <,,> this <,,> beaker <,,> into the water <?> bowl
</?> arrangement I have made <,> and also the <,> borax <,,> water <,,>
combination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#145:2:B>
Borax dissolves and <,> we now have to heat it to seventy degrees
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#146:2:B>
Now <,> if you are doing it at home <,> and if you don't have <,>
thermometer with you <,,> you can <,> as well take <,,> seventy degrees as an
approxiamate temperature when <,> vapours just start coming out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#147:2:B>
Now that the temperature has come to <,> seventy degrees <,,> we
<,> remove these <,> to <,,> and I place at top <,,> bees wax borax <,> or
bees wax and mineral oil <,> combination <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#148:2:B>
And I <,,> start adding <,,> borax water mixture <,> slowly <,,>
with uh <,> continuous <,> stirring <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#149:2:B>
You see a sudden change <,,> and a sort of a <,> emulsion forming
<,> and this is done <,,> under hot conditions <,> both of them <,> at
seventy degrees <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#150:2:B>
Initially both <,> these solutions were colourless <,,> now we
will get a <,> beautiful cream <,> and I <,,> add the whole thing <,> and
<,,> stirr it vigorously <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-058#151:2:B>
You can take the <O> one word </O> <,,> surely <w> it's </w>
different <,> beautiful cream that is prepared <,,> </I>
