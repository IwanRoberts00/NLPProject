<h> <bold> VIOLENCE IS BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#2:1>
Violence has progressively increased in the years following <}>
<-> independence. </-> <+> Independence. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#3:1>
There is, <}> <-> infact, </-> <+> in fact </+> </}> an alarming spurt
in the incidence of communal riots.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#4:1>
Against sixty one districts which had experienced communal trouble in
1661 there are now eighty one districts identified as hypersensitive &
another ninety eight as sensitive districts from the communal point of view.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#5:1>
It seems to be spreading its tentacles a bit wider.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#6:1>
Ahmedabad & <}> <-> Merrut </-> <+> Meerut </+> </}> have become <}>
<-> notrious </-> <+> notorious </+> </}> cities for breeding <}> <->
communial </-> <+> communal </+> </}> trouble.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#7:1>
It was hoped that as secularism entrenches itself, the forces of
communalism will become weak.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#8:1>
But far from subsiding the communal <}> <-> canter </-> <+> centre
</+> </}> is gaining ground. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#9:1>
Communal tension of Hindu-Muslim variety has had a long & sordid
history.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#10:1>
It has been further compounded by the developments in Punjab during
the last five years.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#11:1>
These developments have injected into the situation the potential for
a Hindu- <}> <-> Shikh </-> <+> Sikh </+> </}> confrontation which
fortunately has not materialised.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#12:1>
If by & large the communities have restrained themselves & <}> <->
restained </-> <+> retained </+> </}> their sanity, it is inspite of the <}>
<-> communials </-> <+> communals </+> </}> on either side.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#13:1>
But the restrained exercised by the two communities had come under
serious strain following the mindless killings of the <}> <-> shikhs </-> <+>
Sikhs </+> </}> in the week immediately following the assassination of Mrs.
Indira Gandhi & the three or four occasions when innocent bus passangers were
shot dead by the <}> <-> terriorist </-> <+> terrorists </+> </}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#14:1>
Several <}> <-> commisions </-> <+> commissions </+> </}> which
have probed communal riots have found that it was possible to have kept down
the extent of loss of lives & damage to property, had the steps taken by the
administration been timely & purposive.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#15:1>
It may not be possible to prevent a riot every time but it is
certainly within the capacity of the administration to contain the fall out.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#16:1>
But there was the lack of political will, not enough attention has
been paid to the question of conveying the message to those who have
developed a vested interest in promoting periodical riots that they cannot
hope to buttress their communal leadership.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#17:1>
<}> <-> Infact </-> <+> In fact </+> </}> the base of their
leadership has been broadening with every riot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#18:1>
No less disquietening is the growth of caste violence which has
reached frightening proportions in some regions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#19:1>
Dr. B.R.Ambedkar moving the final reading of the constitution in the
Constituent Assembly observed, <quote> " On the social plane we have in India
a society based on the principle of graded inequality which means elevation
of some & degradation of others.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#20:1>
On the economic plane we have some who have immense wealth as against
many who live in abject poverty.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#21:1>
On Jan 26, 1950 we are going to enter into a life of contradictions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#22:1>
In policies we will have equality & in a social & economic field we
will have inequality.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#23:1>
We must remove this contradiction <*> dotted line </*> else those who
suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy <*>
dotted line </*> " </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#24:1>
We are still in the process of dismantling what we had inherited.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#25:1>
We are trying to usher in a society in which violence of injustice,
violence of human dignity & violence to human rights will all become a part
of history that we have left <}> <-> hand. </-> <+> behind. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#26:1>
For far too <}> <-> larg </-> <+> large </+> </}> we had a society
which can <del> more than the many </del> aptly be deseribed, in the words of
Tagore as one in which <quote> " the few are more than the many." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#27:1>
Vested interests do not allow us to achieve the ideals laid down in
our constitution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#28:1>
Whatever changes towards the personal relationship which regains a
measure of adaptability of the participants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#29:1>
This has not been forth-coming.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#30:1>
So the result is conflicts & consequent violence which appear to the
concomitant of the ongoing social change. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#31:1>
The rural areas of Bihar & Uttar Pradesh have been disfigured by
cruel & endemic violence because of land disputes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#32:1>
The land reform measures as have been implemented have fallen short
of legitimate expectations which were initially fostered among the landless
<}> <-> pesants </-> <+> peasants </+> </}> during the national movement.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#33:1>
The state of the land reforms as it existed on the eve of the sixth
Five Year Plan 1980 was described this <quote> " Necessary determination has
been <}> <-> laking </-> <+> lacking </+> </}> to effectively undertake
action particulary in the matter of implementation of ceiling laws,
canalistiation of holdings & in not rigourously pursuing the concealed
tendncy & having them vested with <}> <-> tennency </-> <+> tenancy </+> </}>
of occupancy rights as enjoined under the law" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#34:1>
The Commission for Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribes in its
<mention> Fifth Report </mention> had concluded that in many states the
necessary political will to implement land <}> <-> reform </-> <+> reforms
</+> </}> was singularly lacking.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#35:1>
This gap between promise & performance has generated considerable
volume of avoidable violence.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#36:1>
The issue related to land often get an infusion of caste feeling &
mindless violence erupts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#37:1>
The ruthless massacre of the land owners or the tillers has been
going on in U.P. & Bihar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#38:1>
Reservation is another explosive issue that has tended to
aggravate caste animosities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#39:1>
Violence arising out of this issue has rocked Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh
& Karnataka & now the people whole of the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#40:1>
It must be made clear that the reservation that is being resisted is
not what has been conceded to Scheduled Caste & Sheduled Tribes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#41:1>
It is an expanding base of reservations among the so called back-ward
castes that threaten to produce a backlash.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#42:1>
The vested interests in backwardness that reservation has created
might also lead to a <}> <-> realignment </-> <+> re-alignment </+> </}> of
communities on lines that can only perpetuate the present division. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#43:1>
The conclusion that <}> <-> follow </-> <+> follows </+> </}> <+>
in </+> <del> this study </del> <+> is that </+> <-> of </-> the violence
<del> that </del> permeates the present Indian society, <del> is </del> that
the changes sought in the different fields are not accompanied by appropriate
& matching institutionally mid-wifeing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#44:1>
So chances are that the institutions will cease to become relevant
<+> , </+> violence become inevitable only to the extent of the inadequacy &
ineffectiveness of the institutional infra-structure in general & the
criminal justice system in particular. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> FREEDOM OF PRESS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#46:2>
Democracy as a form of government depends upon certain healthy
traditions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#47:2>
Till the people are conscious of their rights & duties it is not
possible for democracy to work properly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#48:2>
Similarly opposition should remain alert & put a check upon the
erring government.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#49:2>
Apart from this the people in power should have moral integrity &
should be prep<del>e</del>ared to sacrifice their personal <}> <-> interest
</-> <+> interests </+> </}> for the sake of the public.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#50:2>
The cooperation of the public & the mutual understanding between
the people & the government will ensure the proper working of democracy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#51:2>
But human beings are selfish & particularly so in this competitive
society.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#52:2>
So they cannot expect them to be large hearted to subordinate their
personal interests to the public interest.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#53:2>
That is why in the democratic set up checks & counterchecks are
placed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#54:2>
An independent & powerful press can keep the people in power under
check & keep the general public always informed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#55:2>
People in power have a tendency to become more powerful because
power like a powerful intoxicant goes to the head.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#56:2>
In order to achieve this they always try to encroach upon the rights
of the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#57:2>
If this process continues democracy is <}> <-> prosituated </-> <+>
prostituted </+> </}> & it changes into dictatorship of the people in power.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#58:2>
So the government should be properly bridled.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#59:2>
A common man cannot do anything about it because he had his own
limitations both psychological & financial.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#60:2>
It is the responsibility of the oppositon & the press to keep the
people in power under check.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#61:2>
By bringing out the secrets of the government & by pulling up the
ministers whenever they go against the public interest the press can play an
important role in making democracy healthy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#62:2>
But there is a great possibility that the press may not be able
to play this role because newspaper is itself an industry which is run on
profit & loss basis.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#63:2>
It is generally thought that the press being under the influence of
big businessmen can never be impartial.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#64:2>
It always tries to further the interest of those businessmen & so
they view the activities of the government from the point of view of the
business interests.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#65:2>
That is why in many cases the criticisim given by the press is
partial & one sided under such circumstances very unstable conditions are
created in the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#66:2>
Sometimes it results in frustration among the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#67:2>
So the press can play a negative role & make the working of democracy
somewhat difficult. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#68:2>
Press can keep the people well informed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#69:2>
A common man does not have access to the information regarding the
working of the governments & ministers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#70:2>
The press tries to dig out that information & bring it before the
public.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#71:2>
Watergate Scandal in America was unearthed by the press.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#72:2>
These types of malpractices should be brought to the notice of the
public in order to keep them well informed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#73:2>
It brings the government to the dock & the public opinion goes
against them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#74:2>
Under such circumstances press can make the people in power conscious
of their commitments of the public.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#75:2>
It this respect also we can say that the press is <}> <-> misued </->
<+> misused </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#76:2>
Sometimes the criticism by the press proves to be nothing more than
slander.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#77:2>
Under such circumstances press can misguide the public & may prove
disastrous. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#78:2>
During the elections press is supposed to play a very important
role.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#79:2>
The manifestoes of the different political parties can be brought
home to the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#80:2>
Similarly the speeches of the different leaders belonging to
different political parties must be properly reported.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#81:2>
That is why without press it may become very difficult for the voters
to make a correct choice of the leaders.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#82:2>
If this function is not performed the very existence of many
political parties will be meaningless. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#83:2>
Press eastablishes a link between the people & the govt.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#84:2>
The grievances of the people should be brought to the notice of the
government & the <w> government's </w> policies should be made known to the
public.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#85:2>
Till there is a hot line between the people and the government it is
not possible for democracy to function properly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#86:2>
Till the people know about the activities of the government it is not
possible for them to make a correct assessment of the work of their
representatives & if the grievances of the public are not publicised, the
government may try to ignore them. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#87:3>
<h> <bold> ROLE OF OPPOSITION IN DEMOCRACY. </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#88:3>
Political opposition does not mean simple <}> <-> critism </->
<+> criticism </+> </}> of the people in power.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#89:3>
The opposition party is expected to give a healthy, construction &
well directed criticism.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#90:3>
By constructive critcism we mean criticism which is not meant to pull
down the people in <del> water </del power. 

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#91:3>
Healthy criticisim stands for a criticisim based upon moral
principles & basic values of life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#92:3>
Opposition party is primarily meant for helping the public in
assessing the work of the people in power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#93:3>
Democratic form of Government is supposed to work for the welfare
of the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#94:3>
But generally it starts working against the people because it is
guided more by the lust for power than <}> <-> they </-> <+> their </+> </}>
sincere desire to ameliorate the living conditions of the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#95:3>
As the Government becomes more powerful <+> , </+> the rights of the
people are encroached upon <+> , </+> consequently the institution of
democracy degenerates.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#96:3>
It is the opposition that pinpoints lapses as well as the <}> <->
weakness </-> <+> weaknesses </+> </}> of the people who constitute the
Government.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#97:3>
Under such circumstances it is necessary for the oppsition party to
<-> pin </-> point out to the public that the Government is not working in
larger <}> <-> insterests </-> <+> interests </+> </}> of the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#98:3>
The image of the people in power is tarnished & they become unpopular
with the masses.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#99:3>
The fear of <del> living </del> losing support of the people makes
them to correct themselves. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#100:3>
Opposition helps in making the people politically educated.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#101:3>
The party in power will always try to praise their own policies & a
comman man may live under illusions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#102:3>
On the other hand opposition party will <-> to </-> bring political
awakening among the people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#103:3>
<}> <-> Moreever </-> <+> Moreover </+> </}> when different policies
are given by different political parties there is a choice for the people to
make.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#104:3>
This helps them to think & organise their thoughts properley.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#105:3>
opposition party also takes up the momentary issues & awaken the
people to the realities of the situation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#106:3>
Political culture is important for a country as the political
institution itself & opposition help in injecting the political culture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#107:3>
Opposition serves as an alternative to the Government.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#108:3>
A common man does not want to depart from the beaten track.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#109:3>
He would like to have the same old things because they think that
the persons & ideas which have stood the test of time will live for all times
to come.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#110:3>
That is why they generally become hero worshippers & start feeling
that the failure of government would mean great danger to the nation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#111:3>
If there is a strong oppositon people will not depend upon the
ruling party only.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#112:3>
They will develop a healthy outlook & people would be able to
organize themselves politically in a better manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#113:3>
In some of the contries opposition is given constitutional
recongnition.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#114:3>
In other countries opposition is completely wiped out.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#115:3>
Where there is no opposition authoritarianism becomes strong.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#116:3>
Whereas the countries in which opposition is recongnized democracy
can <}> <-> servive </-> <+> survive </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#117:3>
Political parties give proper direction to the efforts of the people
& as such they can work for the welfare of the democratic society as a whole.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-005#118:3>
In a country like India, opposition is all the more necessary.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#119:3>
The people in power <}> <-> become </-> <+> becomes </+> </}> alomst
Gods upon earth.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#120:3>
As such they are worshiped as super-human <}> <-> being. </-> <+>
beings. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#121:3>
Opposition will awaken the people to realities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#122:3>
Moreover the people in power exploit the ignorance of others & so
they try to become more & more powerful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#123:3>
Opposition puts check <}> <-> upton </-> <+> upon </+> </}> them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#124:3>
Opposition is necessary for the consolidation of democracy & <}> <->
maintainance </-> <+> maintenance </+> </}> of democracy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#125:3>
<}> <-> Some times </-> <+> Sometimes </+> </}> it play a negative
role & undermines the stability.

<ICE-IND:W1A-005#126:3>
This should be checked as far as it <+> is </+> possible. </p> </I>
