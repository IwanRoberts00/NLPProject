<ICE-IND:S2B-026#1:1:A>
Hello viewers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#2:1:A>
All of us are interested <,> in developing the ability <,> to speak  
English fluently <,> and expressively <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#3:1:A>
But many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#4:1:A>
You will find <,> that with a little guidance <,,> and constant  
effort <,,> <w> it's </w> possible to make remarkable improvement <,> in the  
ability to speak English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#5:1:A>
The aim of this programme <,,> is to highlight <,> some of those  
aspects of speech <,,> which contribute <,> to better spoken English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#6:1:A>
I am sure all of us refer to a dictionary <,> whenever we don't know  
the meaning of a word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#7:1:A>
But we quickly have a look at the meaning <,> and then close the  
dictionary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#8:1:A>
There is one important bit of information <,,> which we generally  
don't use <,,> and that is pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#9:1:A>
Every good dictionary <,> gives the pronunciation of a word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#10:1:A>
Whenever you refer to a dictionary <,,> you will find <,> that  
immediately after the entry of the word <,,> its pronunciation <,> or  
transcription is given in bracket <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#11:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look <,> at one such transcription <,> given  
in the dictionary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#12:1:A>
This word <,> is to be pronounced <,> as <mention> agreement  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#13:1:A>
Listen carefully <,,> <mention> agreement </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#14:1:A>
We are aware <,> that many of us say <,> <mention> agreement  
</mention> <,,> and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#15:1:A>
Look at the first symbol <,> in this transcription <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#16:1:A>
It is rather a strange letter <,> because that doesn't appear <,>  
in the ordinary letters <,> of the alphabet <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#17:1:A>
That <}> <-> <.> sta </.> </-> <=> stands </=> </}> for the sound  
<,> <&> IPA symbol </&> <,> the weak sound <&> IPA symbol </&> in English  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#18:1:A>
The next three symbols <,> give us the sound <,> <mention> gree  
</mention> <,,> and the next four symbols <,> give us <,> the sound <,>  
<mention> ment </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#19:1:A>
If you put this together <,,> you get <mention> agreement  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#20:1:A>
You will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking  
symbols <,> used in most dictionaries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#21:1:A>
And it is a matter of a few minutes <,> to get familiar with those  
symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#22:1:A>
You will find that once you know those symbols <,> you will have  
the ability <,> to read the correct pronunciation <,> given in a dictionary  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#23:1:A>
Any dictionary gives <,> a list of phonetic symbols <,> right at  
the beginning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#24:1:A>
For example <,> have a look at this table <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#25:1:A>
In this table <,> you find <,> that on the left <,> there are some  
symbols <,,> phonetic symbols <,> as we call them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#26:1:A>
Towards the right <,,> there are some words <,> which point out  
what are the sounds <,,> represented by those symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#27:1:A>
If you go through this carefully <,,> you will find that <,> in  
fact you already know many of the symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#28:1:A>
As I said <,> there are only a few symbols <,> that you will have  
to try and remember <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#29:1:A>
Let us move on <,> to one important aspect of speech <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#30:1:A>
As we all know <,> there are vowel sounds <,> and consonant sounds  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#31:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> consider <,> two important vowel sounds <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#32:1:A>
First <,> <w> let's </w> take up these words <,,> <mention> lip  
</mention> <,,> <mention> leap </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#33:1:A>
Listen carefully again to these two words <,,> <mention> lip  
</mention> <,,> <mention> leap </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#34:1:A>
You will find <,> that there is difference in the vowel sound <,>  
of these two words <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#35:1:A>
The first sound <,> is a short sound <,> the sound is <mention> i  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#36:1:A>
The second one is a long sound <mention> i: </mention> <,,> and  
that gives you <,> lip <,> leap <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#37:1:A>
Have a look at the next pair of words <,,> <mention> pull  
</mention> <,> <mention> pool </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#38:1:A>
Listen again <,,> <mention> pull </mention> <,> <mention> pool  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#39:1:A>
The contrast <,> is between short <&> IPA symbol </&> <,> and long  
<&> IPA symbol </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#40:1:A>
I would like to give you a simple hint <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#41:1:A>
In case of short vowels <,,> try to make your vowels as short as  
possible <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#42:1:A>
And in case of long vowels <,> try to make them as long as you can  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#43:1:A>
This will help you retain the distinction <,> between the short  
vowels and long vowels <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#44:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> briefly talk about <,> some consonants <,> which are  
problematic to many Indian users of English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#45:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at the next pair of words <,,> <mention>  
fan </mention> <,,> <mention> finish </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#46:1:A>
Listen again <,,> <mention> fan </mention> <,> <mention> finish  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#47:1:A>
Many Indians have a problem <,> in articulating the first sound  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#48:1:A>
Instead of saying <,> <mention> fan </mention> <,,> they say  
<mention> phan </mention> <,,> instead of saying <mention> finish </mention>  
<,> they say <mention> phinish </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#49:1:A>
Have a close look at my lips now <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#50:1:A>
The English sound is <,> <mention> fa </mention> <,,> <mention> fan  
</mention> <,,> <mention> finish </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#51:1:A>
And you will observe <,> that there is a contact <,> between the  
lower lip and the upper teeth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#52:1:A>
Please observe again <,,> <mention> fan </mention> <,,> <mention>  
finish </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#53:1:A>
In the Indian equivalent <,,> you will find that there is a contact  
between the two lips <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#54:1:A>
Look carefully <,,> <mention> pha </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#55:1:A>
Many Indians say <,> <mention> phan </mention> <,,> <mention>  
phinish </mention> <,,> instead <,> they should say <,> <mention> fan  
</mention> <,,> and <mention> finish </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#56:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at the next pair of words <,,> <mention>  
think </mention> <,> and <mention> thank </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#57:1:A>
Again <,> note carefully the first sound <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#58:1:A>
The first sound is <,> <&> IPA symbol </&> <,> and not <mention>  
tha </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#59:1:A>
Many Indians say <,> <mention> think </mention> and <mention> thank  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#60:1:A>
I hope you hear the difference <,,> between the English sound <,>  
and the Indian equivalent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#61:1:A>
Listen again to the difference <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#62:1:A>
The English pronunciation <,> <&> IPA symbols </&> <,,> the Indian  
pronunciation <,> <mention> think </mention> <,,> the English pronunciation  
<,> <&> IPA symbols </&> <,,> the Indian pronunciation <,> <mention> thank  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#63:1:A>
What really happens in the articulation of the English sounds is  
<,,> that the first sound in these words <,> is a friction sound <,,> the air  
comes out <,,> between the lower and the upper teeth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#64:1:A>
Look again <,,> think <,,> thank <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#65:1:A>
And if you are a little aware <,,> of how these sounds are produced  
<,,> that will make a lot of difference <,> to our spoken English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#66:1:A>
We have to take one important piece of care <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#67:1:A>
Many of us <,> are exposed to spelling first <,,> and then to  
pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#68:1:A>
This gives rise <,> to what some people have described <,> as  
spelling pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#69:1:A>
Look at the next three words on the screen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#70:1:A>
The first word <,> is <,> <mention> immediate </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#71:1:A>
Some of you might wonder <,> that this word has another possible  
pronunciation <,> <mention> immediate </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#72:1:A>
<w> That's </w> right <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#73:1:A>
Some words in English <,> have two or more acceptable  
pronunciations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#74:1:A>
This word is either <,> <&> IPA symbols - immediate </&> or <&> IPA  
symbols - immediate </&> <,,> but not <,> <&> IPA symbols - immediate </&>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#75:1:A>
Many Indians think <,> that because there is double <mention> m  
</mention> in spelling <,> there must be two <&> IPA symbols </&> sounds <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#76:1:A>
And therefore they think <,> that the pronunciation must be  
immediately <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#77:1:A>
But <w> let's </w> remember <,> that there is only one <mention> m  
</mention> there <,> and therefore <,> the pronunciation is <&> IPA symbols -  
immediate </&> <,,> or <&> IPA symbols - immediate </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#78:1:A>
The next word <,> is often pronounced by Indians <,> as <mention>  
ring </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#79:1:A>
Listen again <,> <mention> ring </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#80:1:A>
But the British pronunciation would be <,> <&> IPA symbols - rin  
</&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#81:1:A>
The difference is in the last sound <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#82:1:A>
In the British pronunciation <,> there is no <mention> ga  
</mention> at the end <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#83:1:A>
<w> It's </w> <&> IPA symbols - ring </&> and not <&> IPA symbol -  
ring </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#84:1:A>
Similarly <,> in the next word <,,> <w> it's </w> not <&> IPA  
symbols - ringing </&> <,> but <&> IPA symbols - ringing </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#85:1:A>
Again there is no <mention> ga </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#86:1:A>
There is a tendency to go by spelling <,,> and this is one  
important piece of care <,> that <w> we'll </w> have to take <,> about  
English pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#87:1:A>
In the pronunciation that we showed you <,> from the dictionary  
<,,> there was one mark <,> which I didn't explain earlier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#88:1:A>
Before <mention> g </mention> <,> you must have seen a short  
vertical stroke <,> on top of the word <,> and you might have wondered <,>  
what it was <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#89:1:A>
In fact <,> that is called the accent mark <,> or the stress mark  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#90:1:A>
Accent or stress <,> is a very important feature of English speech  
<,> and it has been proved <,> that that lead to intelligibility of English  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#91:1:A>
Between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants <,> and  
the correct accent <,,> what is definitely more important <,> is the right  
accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#92:1:A>
And therefore <,> all of us should be bothered about this feature  
<,> of English speech <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#93:1:A>
You will find that <,,> in any dictionary <,,> the accent is  
indicated <,> by certain kinds of strokes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#94:1:A>
Most of them <,> use a short vertical stroke <,> before the  
accented syllable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#95:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at some of these words on the screen  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#96:1:A>
The first word is <mention> character </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#97:1:A>
Now this word is made up of three syllables <,> or three parts <,>  
<mention> cha </mention> <,> <mention> ric </mention> <,> and <mention> ter  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#98:1:A>
Remember that all these three parts are not said with equal  
emphasis <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#99:1:A>
Listen again <,,> <mention> character </mention> <,,> and you will  
find <,> that I am emphasising <,> I am somehow highlighting <,> the first  
part <mention> cha </mention> <,,> character <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#100:1:A>
I must not pronounce the word <,> as character <,,> or character  
<,,> because this would be a shift in accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#101:1:A>
It has been found out <,> that English is often understood <,> by  
the right accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#102:1:A>
And there has been an experiment <,> an interesting one <,,> where  
it was found <,,> that if Indians pronounce the word as character <,,>  
English speakers <,> heard the word as <mention> director </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#103:1:A>
You might wonder why this happened <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#104:1:A>
Look at the next word on the screen <,> and <w> you'll </w> find  
<,> that that has accent on the second syllable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#105:1:A>
Therefore <,> the English <,> listeners thought <,> that if the  
word <mention> character </mention> <,> had accent on the second syllable it  
couldn't be that word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#106:1:A>
It has to be a word <,> which has accent on the second syllable  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#107:1:A>
And therefore <,> they thought of the nearest word <,,> which has  
accent on the second syllable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#108:1:A>
In the word director <,> there is accent on the second syllable  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#109:1:A>
Again as I told you before <,,> this word has another possible  
pronunciation <,,> you might pronounce it <,> as director <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#110:1:A>
In whichever way you pronounce it <,,> the accent must be on the  
second syllable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#111:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at the next word <,> which is often  
mispronounced by Indians <,,> <mention> employee </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#112:1:A>
There is accent on the third syllable <,,> neither on the first  
syllable nor on the second <,> but on the third <,,> <mention> employee  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#113:1:A>
Whereas many of us tend to say <,> I am an employee of this  
institution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#114:1:A>
The correct pronunciation would be <,> I am an employee of this  
organisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#115:1:A>
The next word is an interesting case <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#116:1:A>
All of us know this word <,,> and we know <,> that this word  
functions <,> as a noun <,> an adjective or a verb <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#117:1:A>
Depending on its grammatical role <,> there is a change in accent  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#118:1:A>
When it is a noun or an adjective <,,> there is accent on the  
first syllable <,,> and therefore the pronunciation is present <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#119:1:A>
When it is a verb <,,> the accent shifts <,> to the second  
syllable <,,> and the pronunciation is <,> present <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#120:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> try to use this in sentences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#121:1:A>
First of all <,,> the word <mention> present </mention> <,> as a  
noun <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#122:1:A>
He gave me a nice birthday present <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#123:1:A>
The word as an adjective <,,> thirty students were present in the  
class yesterday <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#124:1:A>
The word as a verb <,,> we are going to present a play tonight  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#125:1:A>
And I hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations  
<,> of the same word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#126:1:A>
The main difference <,> was that of accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#127:1:A>
In English there are a few words <,,> pairs of nouns and verbs  
<,,> which behave in this particular way <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#128:1:A>
If they are nouns <,,> there is usually accent on the first  
syllable <,,> and if they are verbs <,> there is usually accent on the second  
syllable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#129:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> consider one more example like this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#130:1:A>
The next word on the screen <,,> is both a noun and a verb <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#131:1:A>
If it is a noun <,,> it can be pronounced as produce <,,> if it is  
a verb <,,> it should be pronounced as produce <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#132:1:A>
And I hope you hear the difference in accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#133:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> use these words in sentences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#134:1:A>
The agricultural produce in India has gone up <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#135:1:A>
India produces a lot of wheat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#136:1:A>
Therefore <,> whenever we use words <,> which can function either  
as nouns or verbs <,,> we should be careful <,> about the accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#137:1:A>
When we move from words to sentences <,> there are certain  
problems <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#138:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at the next two sentences <,> on the  
screen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#139:1:A>
Each sentence consists of a few words <,,> and many Indians try to  
give equal emphasis <,> on each word <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#140:1:A>
For example <,,> many Indians might read the first sentence like  
this <,,> my friend has finished the job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#141:1:A>
Whereas <,> if you are a good speaker of English <,> you might  
read it in some such way <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#142:1:A>
My friend has finished the job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#143:1:A>
Listen again to the difference between the two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#144:1:A>
My friend has finished the job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#145:1:A>
And <,> my friend has finished the job <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#146:1:A>
In the English sentence properly said <,> you will find <,> that  
certain words <,,> stand out as more prominent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#147:1:A>
In this sentence <,> the words that stand out as prominent <,> are  
<mention> friend <,> finished and job </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#148:1:A>
The words my <,> has <,> and the <,> are relatively unimportant  
<,,> and therefore <,> you can speak them faster <,> and more weakly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#149:1:A>
Listen to the sentence again <,,> <mention> My friend has finished  
the job </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#150:1:A>
Consider the next sentence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#151:1:A>
<mention> The machine is being repaired </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#152:1:A>
Many Indians might read it as <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#153:1:A>
<mention> The machine is being repaired </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#154:1:A>
Compare this with <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#155:1:A>
<mention> The machine is being repaired <,,> </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#156:1:A>
Look at the first phrase <,> <mention> the machine </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#157:1:A>
Now you hardly hear <,,> the article <mention> the </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#158:1:A>
I am not saying <,> the machine <,,> but I am saying <mention> the  
machine </mention> <,,> <mention> the </mention> is relatively unimportant in  
this sentence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#159:1:A>
If you remember this simple fact <,,> that content words <,> that  
is <,> nouns <,> adjectives <,> adverbs and main verbs <,> are usually more  
important <,> than words like <,> conjunctions <,> articles <,> auxiliary  
verbs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#160:1:A>
You will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#161:1:A>
<w> It's </w> also necessary <,> to have proper pauses <,,> at the  
right places <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#162:1:A>
Because if you don't pause at the right place <,,> you will find  
that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#163:1:A>
Many of us are also aware <,,> of the necessity of using the right  
tone <,> or the right intonation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#164:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> have a look at the next two sentences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#165:1:A>
The first sentence <,,> <mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,>  
in a sense is not ambiguous <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#166:1:A>
The word <mention> beautiful </mention> <,> has one meaning here  
<,,> but depending on the tone <,> that you use <,> in order to say this <,,>  
it can convey different meanings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#167:1:A>
I am going to say this sentence <,> in three different ways <,,>  
and listen carefully to the difference <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#168:1:A>
One <,,> <mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#169:1:A>
Two <,> <mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> and three <,,>  
<mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#170:1:A>
I am sure you have heard <,> the difference between the three  
sentences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#171:1:A>
And <w> you'll </w> find that all these three sentences <,,> said  
with three different tones <,> convey three different meanings <,> in English  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#172:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> consider their meanings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#173:1:A>
Number one <,,> <mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#174:1:A>
This is a matter of fact statement <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#175:1:A>
The speaker really appreciates <,> the beauty <,> of the person  
that he is talking about <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#176:1:A>
But if he says it with a different tone <,> as in number two <,>  
<mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> you might perceive it as a  
question <,,> or you might think <,> that the speaker wants to add something  
after this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#177:1:A>
This might convey <,> the sense of incompleteness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#178:1:A>
Consider the third way <,> of saying that <,,> <mention> She is  
beautiful </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#179:1:A>
This in English <,> indicates that there is some kind of implied  
meaning <,,> and that is left to the imagination of the listener <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#180:1:A>
This sentence <,> <mention> She is beautiful </mention> <,,> could  
mean <,> okay she is beautiful <,> but <,,> foolish <,,> or unreliable or  
something like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#181:1:A>
So the praise <,> the appreciation <,> is not really unqualified  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#182:1:A>
There is some kind of implied meaning <,,> that the speaker is  
trying to convey <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#183:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> consider the next sentence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#184:1:A>
<mention> Close the door </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#185:1:A>
This sentence in isolation <,> is a command <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#186:1:A>
But if you use the right kind of tone <,,> this can be perceived  
as a request <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#187:1:A>
Let me point out <,> that there are different way <,,> of making  
requests in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#188:1:A>
You can add words like <,> please or kindly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#189:1:A>
You can change the sentence construction and say <,> <mention>  
Would you mind closing the door </mention> <,,> or <mention> May I ask a  
favour of you </mention> <,> and then you ask the person to close the door  
<,,> or <,> a third possibility <,> is to use the right tone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#190:1:A>
For example <,> listen to the difference <,> between these two  
sentences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#191:1:A>
<mention> Close the door </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#192:1:A>
<mention> Close the door </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#193:1:A>
The first sentence is perceived as a strong command <,> whereas  
the second one is seen as a polite request <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#194:1:A>
This indicates <,> that intonation or tone plays a very important  
role <,> in speech <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#195:1:A>
A wrong intonation <,> can sometimes convey wrong meaning <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#196:1:A>
And this can cause a lot of misunderstanding <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#197:1:A>
As we said at the beginning <,,> all of us would like to speak  
fluently <,,> and there is a common misunderstanding <,> that fluency means  
fast speech <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#198:1:A>
This is not really right <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#199:1:A>
You can be slow in speed <,> and yet be fluent <,,> because  
fluency depends <,> on the kind of flow <,> that your speech has <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#200:1:A>
The speed must be controlled by what you are talking about <,> and  
it is also directed <,> <w> it's </w> also controlled by your personality <,>  
to some extent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#201:1:A>
Even if you take into account <,> all these aspects of speech <,,>  
which we have discussed <,,> there is one extremely important thing <,> and  
that is confidence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#202:1:A>
Unless you feel self- confident <,,> you will not be able to make  
significant progress <,> in spoken English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#203:1:A>
Of course <,> your confidence must be supplemented by hard work  
and patience <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#204:1:A>
At the end <,,> <w> let's </w> try to sum up <,> the important  
aspects of speech <,> to which we must pay attention <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#205:1:A>
One <,> the correct articulation <,> of vowels and consonants <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#206:1:A>
Two <,> the right accent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#207:1:A>
Three <,> the right kind of rhythm <,> depending on <,> accenting  
important words <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#208:1:A>
And lastly <,> intonation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#209:1:A>
As I said <,> all these should be supplemented by confidence <,>  
and hard work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-026#210:1:A>
Thank you <,,> </I>
