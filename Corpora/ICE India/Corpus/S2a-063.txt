things I will have to admit Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#39:1:A>
One <,> one of these is <,> the one the <,> the uh <@> Iyengar </@>
has been assaulted <,> and his death has been caused <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-063#40:1:B>
We don't dispute that <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-063#41:1:A>
There is also no dispute <,> <&> interruption </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-063#42:1:B>

these witnesses <,> who have who have come here and deposed <,,> are <,,>
trustworthy witnesses <,,> in favour of accused number <,> against <,>
accused number two and three <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#48:1:A>
This is <,> way <w> I'm </w> <w> I'm </w> going to <,> start <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#49:1:A>
Now the first thing is Sir <,> why he <,> insisted witness <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#50:1:A>
Because Sir <,> they all are uh being close <.> rela </.> uh it is
on their evidence <,,> that <,,> this uh <@> Santosh </@> <,> and his mother
<,> after <,,> <@> Iyengar </@> was removed to the hospital <,> they also
followed <,> and went to the hospital <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#51:1:A>
So in that case <,> <@> Santosh </@> was in the hospital <,> on
three four eighty-eight Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#52:1:A>
As my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert
enough <,,> they have examined <,> the eye witnesses <,> on that same day <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#53:1:A>
But <,> Your Honour will see Sir <,> that the evidence of <,> this
P W seven <,> has not been <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <,> <=> recorded </=>
</}> on on three four <,> though he was available and present in <,> hospital
Sir <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#54:1:A>
<@> Santosh </@> <,,> though he was present <,> and available to
them in hospital <,> and they were very <,> alert enough to examine all the
eye witnesses <,> on the same day <,,> if not if uh in the hospital Sir <,>
<}> <-> in in in in the </-> <,> <=> in the </=> </}> police station but same
day <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#55:1:A>
I am talking of the same day <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#56:1:A>
But though Your Honour will assign that the statement of <@>
Santosh </@> has been recorded on four four eighty-eight <,> next day Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#57:1:A>
Why <,,> why this <,,> this uh has been postponed Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#58:1:A>
My submission is Sir <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#59:1:A>
Time is not given <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#60:1:A>
On on <,> I have seen that the original <,,> time is not <,> not
mentioned Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#61:1:A>
But date is date is four four <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#62:1:A>
<@> santosh </@> Sir <&> in Marathi </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#63:1:A>
The date is four four <,,> eighty-eight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#64:1:A>
Time not mentioned Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#65:1:A>
I sent to the return services there Sir <,> but I have seen it and
uh <,> I didn't find it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#66:1:A>
Yes Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#67:1:A>
Anyway Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#68:1:A>
Now why this why this delay of one day Sir <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#69:1:A>
My submission is Sir <,,> that <,,> the officers <,,> when they
recorded the statement <,,> of eye witnesses <,,> specially this <@> Arif
</@> <,> <@> Kadu </@> and such <&> interruption </&> when <,,> they recorded
the statement of these P W <@> Arif Jauhar </@> <,> <@> Kadu Timothy </@> and
<@> Nasreen </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#70:1:A>
In their statements <,> they were not <,> they had not emphatically
<,,> said <,,> about the assault <,,> on seven <,> two and three on <@>
Iyengar </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#71:1:A>
Their names were not given <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#72:1:A>
Therefore <,> they wanted <,,> somebody <,,> to <,> give the names
of these <,> two assailants <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#73:1:A>
Further these <,> these <,> two <}> <-> <.> assai </.> </-> <=>
assailants </=> </}> <,> there according to the <,,> prosecution <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#74:1:A>
They were known <,> to <,,> <@> Kadu uh Achari </@> <,> and P W
three <,> <@> Kadamma </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#75:1:A>
Because <,> they have seen them <,> in that labour camp locality
<,,> and they were knowing the names <,> and therefore <,,> they want to put
<,> put these names of names of <,> number two and three in the in the mouth
<,> of P W seven <,> and therefore this delay of one day Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#76:1:A>
And therefore my submission is Sir <,> that he he is a witness <,,>
who being a blood relation is one thing <,> he is out to uh uh say that this
uh <,> both these persons <,> and another thing is is that he is under the
thumb of the these <,> these two police <,> to say what they want to say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#77:1:A>
I specially name number two and three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#78:1:A>
And therefore this delay as I <,> I have already told <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#79:1:A>
Yes beg your pardon Sir <,> <&> interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#80:1:A>
So he has he has named it <,,> three persons only Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#81:1:A>
Because Sir they wanted to <}> <-> <.> in </.> </-> <=> involve
</=> </}> these persons <,,> and therefore <,,> uh his uh <,> statement has
been <,,> delayed <&> interruption </&> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#82:1:A>
Yes Sir <,> recorder is underneath <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#83:1:A>
Now Sir let us see <,> the <}> <-> <.> e ev </.> </-> <=> evidence
</=> </}> on record Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#84:1:A>
What type of evidence on record has been <,,> recorded Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#85:1:A>
Now he has <,> he has stated Sir <,> that the <@> Big Umesh </@>
assaulted my father by knife <,,> I do not <,> recollect on which <,> uh Sir
it is uh <,> page page seventy-five <,,> line eighteen to twenty Your Honour
<&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#86:1:A>
Seventy-five Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#87:1:A>
Ha <quote> <@> Big Umesh </@> assaulted my father <,,> with knife
<,,> I do not recollect on which portion of the body <,,> of my father <,>
was assaulted by <@> Big Umesh </@> </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#88:1:A>
So <,,> I <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#89:1:A>
Now Sir if if he <,> if he has seen the assault <,,> then he should
tell Sir on which part <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#90:1:A>

legs <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#91:1:A>
So <w> he'd he'd </w> given given definite part <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#92:1:A>
In his case if he had really seen it Sir <,> my submission is Sir
that <,,> he he he should have given the <,> part

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#93:1:A>
But he does not give Sir

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#94:1:A>
He said I don't recollect <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#95:1:A>
But recollection I mean uh <,> that that can't be any reason <,>
for <,> whether whether he has seen it or not seen it that is <,> these are
the only two <}> <-> <.> que </.> </-> <=> questions </=> </}> we can <,> we
have to <,> answer Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#96:1:A>
Now this this also Sir <,,> uh uh is an <}> <-> <.> imp </.> </->
<=> improvement </=> </}> <,,> and uh omission has been proved <,,> uh in the
<,> in in the statement uh Your Honour I will tell one minute <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#97:1:A>
It is one ninety-seven Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#102:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sorry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#103:1:A>
Then Sir further up <,,> uh at page seventy-five only Sir line
twenty <,> twenty to twenty-two Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#104:1:A>
He says Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#105:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#106:1:A>
This implement is is proved but <,> yet <w> I'm </w> sorry Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#107:1:A>
At page one ninety-seven <,,> line <,> three Sir <,> from below

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#108:1:A>

<indig> Haan </indig> by that time Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#112:1:A>
Because it is not mentioned there <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#113:1:A>
Yes Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#114:1:A>
Sir this this contradiction has been has been proved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#115:1:A>
That he has not said <,> stated so <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#116:1:A>
Sir this this is <,> this is definitely a improvement <,,> a
before this honourable court Sir <,,> <&> interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#117:1:A>
Yes Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#118:1:A>
Then further Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#119:1:A>
I I narrated the the incident to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#120:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#121:1:A>
I narrated the incident to the to them <,> that my father was
assaulted <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#122:1:A>
However I did not utter the names of the assailants <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#123:1:A>
Now Sir <,,> if he has not given the names <,> of the assailants
<,,> then immediately after the assault he goes to the mother and <,,> and
tells this I mean part uh uh <,> tells this information <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#124:1:A>
So he has seen the incident

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#125:1:A>
If he had seen the incident <,> he could have given the names <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#126:1:A>
My submission is Sir <,,> that time <,> if he has not given the
names that means <,> either he has not seen them Sir <,,> or he has seen some
persons whose names he did not know <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#127:1:A>
This this this can be only two possibilities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#128:1:A>
Then Sir <,,> page seventy-eight <,,> line eighteen <,> to
nineteen eighteen and nineteen Your Honour <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#129:1:A>
Yes Your <.> Hon </.> <,> uh <,> lines were drawn on the ground by

</=> </}> <,,> P W nine Sir <,> Because he is the person who has <,,> who has
produced that <,> <indig> Challa </indig> game board <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#133:1:A>
It was cardboard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#134:1:A>
Everybody says that it was a cardboard <,> and uh specially this
<@> Kadu </@> he has produced that cardboard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#135:1:A>
And therefore Sir <,,> this man <,> when this man says Sir that
knife is gone on the on on the ground <,> and then in the square <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#136:1:A>
That means this also shows Sir <,,> that he has not <,> Sir he was
not present at the <,> at the scene of offence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#137:1:A>
Because <,,> what is the fact he does not know Sir <,,>

So actually it was a cardboard <,> when this <,> <?> request
states </?> that lines were drawn on the <,> ground

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#144:1:A>
That means he has not <,> seen the <,,>

He was not at the scene of offence Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#146:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#170:1:A>
He is carrying on the business <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#171:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#172:1:A>
He doesn't possess any document <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#173:1:A>
Therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business <,,> is
not proved Sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#174:1:A>
Now Sir <,> another thing about this witness <}> <-> I I <.> wa
</.> </-> <=> I want </=> </}> to say Sir <,> that he hasn't got any any uh
uh regard for the truth Sir <,> because he changes the <.> mat </.> <,>
version <,,> in just <,> in a second or or sentence for <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#175:1:A>
For that <w> I'll </w> <w> I'll </w> point <w> I'll </w> take Your
Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#176:1:A>
He yes uh at page eighty-three Your Honour <,> uh at uh <,> line
nineteen <,> and twenty-two Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#177:1:A>
<@> Iyengar </@> was <,> was also assaulted by <,,> three more <.>
per </.> associates of <@> N H S </@> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#178:1:A>
He said this <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#179:1:A>
Then Sir <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#180:1:A>
Of <@> N H </@> uh <@> N H S </@> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#181:1:A>
Now I said <,> that then in the next he said now I say <,,> that
two other <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> remaining </=> </}> associates of <@>
N H S </@> <,,> a a a also assaulted <@> Iyengar </@>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#182:1:A>
So he make changes in this Sir <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#183:1:A>
Yes Sir

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#184:1:A>
Then then oh <,,> if he has he has seen a certain incident <,>
then there is no necessity to change Sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#185:1:A>
I understand Sir why it is changed <,> <w> I'll </w> <w> I'll </w>
<w> I'll </w> tell Your Honour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#186:1:A>

audience <,> and note carefully Sir <,> who just <,,> that you have you have
<,> doing something wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#187:1:A>
So they must have put extra fingers instead of three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#188:1:A>
So he said two persons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#189:1:A>
Why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only <&>
interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#190:1:A>
That is my argument

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#191:1:A>
He is you take it or or leave it <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#192:1:A>

</w> got down from the motor taxi <,> and went to the <,> shop of <@>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#196:1:A>
He is incorrect <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#197:1:A>
He is not correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#198:1:A>
So he admits Sir <,> what he has stated yesterday <,> was was not
correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#199:1:A>
Therefore I want I am just pointing out Sir <,> uh what regard he
has for the truth truth Sir

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#200:1:A>
He himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever I stated <,> was
not correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-063#201:1:A>
So my submission is Sir that evidence of such a man Sir <,> who
hasn't got any <,> any regard for the truth should be taken with <,,> uh with
pinch of <,,>
