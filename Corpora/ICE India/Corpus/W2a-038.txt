<bold> The information currently available on the status of
environmental pollution have been directly dependent on the advances made in
analytical techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#5:1>
<mention> Organic and inorganic toxic pollutants </mention> are
generally present in micro and submicro quantities in the environment and
their determination at these level needs accurate, precise and sensitive
analytical techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#6:1>
Some of the techniques used for environmental pollutants are based
on spectrophotometry, chromatography, polorography, mass
spectrophotometry, spectrofluorometry, ion selective electrodes and neutron
activation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#7:1>
The selection of analytical technique depends on the expected level
and characteristics of the environmental pollutants. </bold> </p> <&> in two

<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#9:1>
Environmental pollutants are discharged into air, water and soil
from anthrapogenic activity and depending on their characteristics, they
form an equlibrium between them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#10:1>
Monitoring of environmental pollutants needs effective sampling
procedure and precise, sensitive and accurate analytical techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#11:1>
Proper selection of sampling locations, preservation of samples and
analytical methodology are the important aspects of environmental
monitoring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#12:1>
Sampling methods, and preservation of samples differ from one
component of environment to another.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#13:1>
Pretreatment of samples before using an appropriate technique also
differs for <}> <-> varioue </-> <+> various </+> </}> components of
environment. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#14:1>
<h> <bold> WATER QUALITY MONITORING </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#15:1>
Monitoring of pollutants in water starts from its sampling and
is based on the results of the analysis of the samples taken from a
particular site.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#16:1>
The monitoring results are actually indicative of the quality
of water sample under investigation rather than the water body from where the
sample is taken.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#17:1>
If water is of relatively uniform composition in both time and space
then any sample will suffice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#18:1>
However, if the sample is nonuniform at sampling site or its
composition varies with time, then no single sample is truely representative.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#19:1>
Monitoring requires that water samples are collected at intervals so
that no change in quality could pass unnoticed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#20:1>
The observed value and true value always differs due to various
reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#21:1>
The larger the number of samples from which the mean is derived, the
narrower is the limit of the probable difference.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#22:1>
However, the sampling schedule is a compromise between accuracy
and facilities available for the work.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#23:1>
It is always advantageous to measure the pollutants <it> <foreign> in
situ </foreign> </it> by means of sensors which are lowered into the water
bodies rather than withdrawing samples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#24:1>
This is not always possible and the samples are to be collected in
suitable containers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#25:1>
Borosilicate glass or polyethylene bottles are suitable for sample
collection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#26:1>
Maintaining the integrity of the pollutants is an essential
pre-requisite for any monitoring programme.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#27:1>
Once the sample is taken the constituents of the sample must stay
in the same condition as collected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#28:1>
Effective preservation method is, therefore, needed to find valid
data from monitoring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#29:1>
Most of the chemical parameters can be preserved from one day to
14 day by storing the sample under refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#30:1>
Trace metals may be preserved upto 6 month by adding 2 ml of
concentrated nitric acid per litre of sample so that pH goes below 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#31:1>
Only mercury requires 2 ml / l of 20 % potassium dichromate
solution prepared in 50 % nitric acid.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#32:1>
Phenol needs 6 ml of 6N sodium hydroxide solution per litre water so
that pH is above 12 and refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C for 24 hr
preservation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#33:1>
Organics are preserved by storing water samples under
refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C for 7 to 14 day depending on their
nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#34:1>
However, it is advisable to extract the organics into suitable
organic solvent within 24 hr and then preserve the organic extracts under
refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#35:1>
Certain specific compounds need special preservation which depends
on their chemical properties.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#36:1>
Preservation of sample is a very important step in water quality
monitoring and it should be strictly adhered to. </p> <O> <&> page </&>

<h> <bold> AIR QUALITY MONITORING </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#38:1>
Monitoring of pollutants in ambient air needs proper choice of
sampler.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#39:1>
For monitoring of metals adsorbed on the suspended particulate
matter, a high volume sampler is the most suitable choice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#40:1>
A portion of the filter paper used for the determination of SPM is
cut and the metal is extracted in nitric acid which is used for metals
determination.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#41:1>
Gaseous pollutants are sampled in impingers with appropriate
adsorption solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#42:1>
The gaseous pollutants having acid nature need alkali solution as
the ultimate choice and for gases with alkali characteristics, the choice
is acid solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#43:1>
Mercury need acidic dichromate solution while pesticides need n -
hexane as trapping solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#44:1>
Recording of meterological data, like wind direction, wind speed,
temperature, relative humidity, etc., is essential.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#45:1>
Accurate flow measurement of sampling is most important.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#46:1>
Now-a-days automatic monitoring instruments based on infra-red
spectrophotometry, chemuluminiscence, conductivity and other
physico-chemical properties are also available for the monitoring of
gaseous pollutants. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#47:1>
<h> <bold> ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING TECHNIQUES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#48:1>
The requirement of the analytical technique selected for
determination of a pollutant in the environment is its capability to detect
and determine it at extremely low concentrations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#49:1>
The technique should prferably be applicable to the sample
directly and be capable of yielding information on the nature of the species
present.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#50:1>
It is also desirable that the technique requires bare minimum
sample treatment to avoid contamination and subsequent enhancement of
blank values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#51:1>
Some of the techniques used in environmental monitoring are described
here under. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#52:1>
<h> <bold> Atomic spectrometry </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#53:1>
Atomic spectrometric methods have contributed significantly
towards environmental pollution monitoring studies on heavy metals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#54:1>
Some of them have excellent detection limits and minimum
interference effects.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#55:1>
However, the technique is incapable of yielding information on the
species of the metals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#56:1>
This technique determines the total concentration of the metals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#57:1>
More than 60 elements can be determined at solution concentrations
between 0.1 and 100 <*> mu</*>g / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#58:1>
Atomic adsorption spectrophotometry is still the method of choice
for the analysis of environmental samples and both flame and non-flame
methods have been used for environmental monitoring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#59:1>
The senstivity of the flame atomic adsorption spectrophotometry
is, however, not high enough to detect most of the trace metals at levels
they are normally present in the environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#60:1>
The sensitivity of the method may be enhanced by using the method of
complexation coupled with organic solvent extraction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#61:1>
These additional steps, however, make the techniques time
consuming and sometimes increases blank values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#62:1>
The flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry is suitable for major
elements, like <mention> irom </mention> , <mention> manganese </mention> ,
<mention> copper </mention> , <mention> zinc </mention> , etc., which
generally occur in the environment at concentrations which lie in the
sensitivity range of flame <mention> AAS </mention> technique ( Hasan and
Pande, 1978 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#63:1>
Flameless atomic absorption methods are most suitable for the
determination of trace metals, like <mention> arsenic </mention> , <mention>
cedmium </mention> , <mention> chromium </mention> , <mention> cobalt
</mention> , <mention> nickel </mention> , <mention> lead </mention> ,
<mention> salenium </mention> , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#64:1>
The technique requires very small sample volume and has extremely
low detection limit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#65:1>
This technique has, however, the problem of matrix interference which
are quite severe and at the atomization stage non-specific absorption can
be very significant ( Hasan and Pande, 1988a, 1983 b ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#66:1>
The matrix interference can be removed either by platform technique
or by matrix modification.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#67:1>
In the former a small graphite platform is placed inside the tube
and the sample is introduced on the platform.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#68:1>
The platform is treated primarily by radiation from the furnace
resulting in lower temperature in platform as compared to the temperature of
the tube wall.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#69:1>
This reduces the interference by lowering the rate of condensation of
analyte and recombination of atomic species. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#70:1>
Matrix modification methods have been extensively used for the
determination of trace metals in water and wastewater.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#71:1>
It was observed that the addition of molybdenum minimizes several
interferences ( Henn, 1977 ) while addition of nitric acid decereases
non-specific absorption caused by sodium and potassium chloride ( Tanaka
<it> et al </it> ., 1978 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#72:1>
Interference in the determination of lead and cadmium has been
successfully removed by the addition of aluminium ( Panda and Pendarkar, 1980 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#73:1>
Addition of a mixture of ascorbic acid and ammonium nitrate
removes the interferences due to alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and
anions in the determination of manganese ( Kumar <it> et al </it> ., 1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#74:1>
Determination of trace metals of environmental significance <O> <&> page
</&> 609 </O> has been reviewed ( Kumar <it> et al </it> .,
1987 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#75:1>
Cold vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry using the method
described by Hatch and Ott ( 19 68 ) and modified by Uthe <it> et al </it> .
( 1970 ) is most suitable for the determination of mercury.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#76:1>
The method involves wet acid digestion of the sample, followed
by reduction, aeration and measurement of mercury vapour absorption at 253.7
nm. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#77:1>
<h> <bold> Plasma emission spectrometry </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#78:1>
A plasma is a gas whose significant portion is ionized and
thus large quantities of electrical energy can be transferred to it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#79:1>
This source is, therefore, capable of atomization and excitation of
metals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#80:1>
Based on this principle an inductively coupled plasma ( ICP )
source was developed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#81:1>
This source is an electrodeless argon plasma formed at atmospheric
pressure and sustained by inductive coupling to high frequency magnetic
fields ( Fassel, 1978 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#82:1>
Later on direct current plasma ( DCP ) which is an electrical
discharge maintained by a core consisting of a continuous <mention> DC
</mention> arc and stabilized by flowing gas, was also developed ( Andrew,
1982 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#83:1>
Plasmas provide excellant <mention>
vaporization-atomization-excitation-ionization </mention> sources
for analytical atomic emission spectropcopy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#84:1>
Plasma emission spectrometry is rapidly taking the position of atomic
absorption spectrophotometry.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#85:1>
The inter-element interactions are small or insignificant for
reasonable changes in the concentrations of concomitants under
experimental conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#86:1>
It is possible to establish a single set of calibration curves for
the detection of analytes in a variety of sample matrices.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#87:1>
Spectral interferences are common in these techniques, however,
these may be reduced by judicious selection of the line to be used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#88:1>
These techniques provide direct analysis of solid, liquid and
gasseous pollutants with minimal sample preparation ( Walter <it> et al </it> .,
1980 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#89:1>
<h> <bold> Colorimetry </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#90:1>
<mention> Colorimetric </mention> methods are very frequently
used in environmental monitoring and these methods were the only official
methods of determination three decades ago.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#91:1>
These methods are based on the formation of colour complexes with
the pollutants and then determining the absorbance of the colour which
ultimately gives the concentration of the pollutante.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#92:1>
Methods based on this technique have been described in standard
methods for the examination of water and wastewater ( APHA, AWWA, WPCF,
1992 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#93:1>
These are universal methods and can be used for inorganic as well as
organic pollutants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#94:1>
These methods have, however, the problems of non-specificity and
inferior sensitivity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#95:1>
Colorimetric methods have got several advantages also as they do
not need sophisticated instruments or high skill and can be performed with
some specific chemicals and a simple spectrocolorimeter.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#96:1>
Extensive literature is available on these techniques and on
certain occasions when no other methods are available, one has to depend
on these methods only.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#97:1>
The sensitivity may be poor but accuracy and precision are
superior to other techniques. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#98:1>
<h> <bold> Polarography </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#99:1>
It is an electroanalytical technique, in which the intensity of
diffusion current measures the concenetration and half wave potential
identifies the particular species.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#100:1>
This technique, however, has higher detection limit and, therefore,
it is not used much in environmental monitoring.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#101:1>
The advancement in polarography is <quote> ` stripping voltammetry'
</quote> , which has wide application. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#102:1>
<h> <bold> Stripping voltammetry </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-038#103:1>
<mention> Stripping voltammetry </mention> is a 2 stage process.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#104:1>
The first stage is a preconcentration process in which the
analyte present in a liquid is concentrated at an electrode by
electrolysis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#105:1>
The second stage consists of electrochemical removal of the
deposited analyte back into solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#106:1>
The second process is also called <mention> stripping process
</mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#107:1>
The resulting current due to stripping is used to determine the
concentration of analyte in the solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#108:1>
The preconcentration step makes <mention> stripping voltammetry
</mention> a technique capable of determining extremely low concentration
of the analyte.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#109:1>
The stripping current is proportional to the depolarizer
concentration and is frequently related to the depolarizer half wave
potential.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#110:1>
The technique is useful in determining several species
simultaneously, differentiating different oxidation states and labile
and bound forms of metal in natural waters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-038#111:1>
Depending on the deposition / accumulation and stripping, the
technique is referred as <mention> anodic or cathodic stripping voltammetry
</mention> . </p> </I>
