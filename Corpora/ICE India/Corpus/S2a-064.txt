To show <,> why the statement of this witness was not recorded

statement as she was <,> mourning upon the death of her <,,> youngest son <,>

On the next day <,> of death she may be waiting for the dead body  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-064#97:1:A>
The people from the locality must have been <,> collected to pacify
