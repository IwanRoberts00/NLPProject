<I> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#1:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#2:1:A>
Both of you how do you find this <,,> your course <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#3:1:B>
Well <,> <O> clears her throat </O> <w> it's </w> quite  
interesting <,> I mean uh <,,> like uh <,,> when it really comes to <,,>  
practical point of view <w> it's </w> quite interesting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#4:1:B>
Now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying <,> regarding all  
the <,,> uh how the <,,> uhm dental materials <,> used and how are the <,,>  
things that are mixed together <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#5:1:B>
And like <,,> what are the materials that are used for dentures and  
what are the <,,> materials that are used for fillings and everything <,>  
mixing dying and then <,> setting them everything we are dealing in <,>  
dental material <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#6:1:B>
Whereas this is a such a bore <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#7:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> in final year but <,,> like they have <,,> started from  
first year itself <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#8:1:B>
So that we get a <,> whole round uh <,,> must have point <,> point  
of view regarding the subject <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#9:1:B>
Then uhm <,,> then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all  
that we come to know <,,> whether uh <,> structures that are present  
anatomically and then <,> physiology means like <,> whether the system are  
<,> working and how <,> how does it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#10:1:B>
Suppose for example <,> in digestive system like how does it get  
disturbed <,> or how does the liver works <,,> and all those things <,> we  
study in physiology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#11:1:B>
And then <,,> though they are like <,> we find it quite <,,> dry at  
the moment <,> but when it comes to the clinical <,,> when we see the  
patients and when we deal with the patients then <,,> <w> it's </w> quite  
interesting I mean <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#12:1:A>
So you have started dealing with your patients and all <,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#13:1:B>
No no we are uh <,> just starting to face like 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#14:1:B>
We are in first year <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#15:1:B>
So clinicals we start from third year onwards <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#16:1:B>
So we are looking forward for training <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#17:1:A>
So like your practical is still with <,,> like how is your <,>  
what is the process of your practicals <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#18:1:B>
I mean uh <,,> in <,> third year or <,> you mean in <{> <[>  
every year every year </[> we have got different <,> practicals <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#19:1:A>
<[> No right now <,> so far </[> </{> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#20:1:B>
Suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like <?>  
amphibian </?> and human physiology <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#21:1:B>
In human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we  
test the blood and then we count <,> R B C count <,,> then W B C count then  
<,,> like uhm <,,> after that we see <,,> the hemoglobin <,> <O> one word  
</O> and then <,> differential count in W B C <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#22:1:B>
All these things we count <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#23:1:B>
That is to we take on the <,> <O> coughs </O> our <,> human blood  
itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#24:1:B>
Then in <,> amphibian practical we <,> dissect the frog <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#25:1:B>
Then we <,,> try to see the models which <,,> then the oscillation  
and then <O> one word </O> of uh <,,> nerves and everything <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#26:1:B>
So that comes under physiology 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#27:1:B>
And bio-chem we <,> have separately done like <,,> how are this uh  
<,,> proteins and <,> nutrition differential <.> bet </.> between the unknown  
solutions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#28:1:B>
They will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the <,>  
experiments until we found out whether <w> it's </w> protein or <,,> whether  
it is carbohydrates <,,> or sometimes <,> urea uh uric acid all those things 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#29:1:A>
<w> It's </w> uh <,> chemistry lab <,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#30:1:B>
Yeah <,,> <w> it's </w> done in separately in <,,> chemistry  
lab <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#31:1:A>
So how many <,,> practicals you have <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#32:1:B>
How many practicals uh <,> like <,> for physiology we have <,>  
two practicals and <,,> bio-chem we have one practical and <,,> we have  
dissection in anatomy <w> that's </w> also a practical like <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#33:1:B>
And then uh <,,> we have for physics <,> practicals <,> where we  
<,,> like finding the cast <,,> and out of cast we have to form uh <,> make  
display <,> and although the display we equip with uh <,,> wax <?> ring </?>  
<,,> like 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#34:1:B>
So those are some models like we have to <,> know from now onwards  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#35:1:B>
So that is <,> in practical <,,> practically in uhm <,,> for  
physics <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#36:1:A>
So you are in second year now <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#37:1:A>
You are in second year <,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#38:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#39:1:A>
Then <,,> like uh <,> after your <,,> after you finish your  
degree what is your <,,> further <,,> plans <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#40:1:B>
Well if I get through perfectly you know <,> I mean <,,> good  
colours then <,> I would like to go for my P G <,,> and <w> that's </w> post  
graduation in we have got seven different uh <,,> like uh <,> departments 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#41:1:B>
So <,> in each department we can chose whichever you want to do 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#42:1:A>
Specialise <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#43:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> <,> specialise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#44:1:B>
So I want to do in ortho <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#45:1:A>
What is Ortho <,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#46:1:B>
Ortho orthodentia <,,> that is uh they put braces and <,,> all  
those things <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#47:1:A>
And what about Chandini <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#48:1:A>
So far <,> how is your <,,> ragging <,,> ? <O> laughter </O> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#49:1:B>
Ragging <,,> <O> laughs </O> fine 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#50:1:A>
<O> Cough </O> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#51:1:A>
No you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your  
classmates and <,,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#52:1:B>
No they used to ask us about our biodata no <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#53:1:B>
And they uh make us sing <,,> and then dance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#54:1:B>
They are also enjoying uh <,> we are also enjoying <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#55:1:A>
So you also you enjoyed ragging 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#56:1:B>
<{> <[> Ah ha </[> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#57:1:A>
<[> What <.> so </.> </[> </{> what sort of ragging <,> they  
used to <,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#58:1:B>
Mentally <,,> not physically and not physically <,,> <&>  
recording broken or a long pause </&> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#59:1:A>
So uh <,,> what <,,> I mean what do you think about the people  
in India <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#60:1:B>
I mean here in Hyderabad the people are <,,> <w> it's </w>  
okay <,> they are nice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#61:1:B>
I mean uh <,,> my friends they are <,> friendly and uh <,> used to  
help me a lot in my work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#62:1:B>
And <,,> this just a one <,> uh one month back time I am here in  
Hyderabad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#63:1:B>
So I have made friends with uh <,,> some of my <,,> classmates <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#64:1:B>
And uh <,,> so <,,> so to say friendly and <,,> <O> laughs </O> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#65:1:A>
Helpful yeah 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#66:1:B>
Yeah helpful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#67:1:B>
Usually the people here in <,> I mean down in <,> south <,,> they  
are very helpful 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#68:1:A>
Yeah south 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#69:1:B>
But <,> what I find the difference in <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#70:1:A>
According to <,,> any 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#71:1:B>
I mean only in south eastern they are <,,> like in Bangalore  
where the people are quite different like <,> they are helpful as well as  
they are quite broadminded and <,> they are quite friendly with the people  
and <,,> I mean <,,> I mean the <,,> environment is so different from  
Hyderabad 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#72:1:A>
Yeah 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#73:1:B>
Whereas Hyderabad the people are more <,> conservative and  
like <,> they don't like to go out even <,> or <,,> at the first move they  
don't like to talk with people also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#74:1:B>
But whereas when they really come to know the people they like to  
help the people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#75:1:B>
Then uh <,,> for example like whereas in Bangalore you go out in  
shorts or <,> even the females <,> go out in shorts or <,> anything like that  
they don't mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#76:1:B>
I mean <,,> they are more advanced in all those things and then  
<,,> whereas in Hyderabad if you even wear a <,,> skirt even like <,> then  
they <,> give a good I mean <,> back stare at you and you feel out of place  
like when you wear all those stuff <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#77:1:B>
Then you feel that <,,> okay somebody is observing me so much and  
you feel <,,> uncomfortable in all those things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#78:1:B>
Whereas in <,> Bangalore you are free like <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#79:1:B>
I don't think people will be <,> least bothered like even if you go  
<,> almost like a naked female and <,,> <O> laughs </O> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#80:1:B>
So <,,> those are the difference according to the places also 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#81:1:B>
And whereas in Madras when you can see <,> the people are <,,> I  
mean <,,> what to say uh <,,> they are still yet to build up <,,> in all  
those things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#82:1:B>
Atleast in Hyderabad <w> it's </w> <,> I mean they have become more  
modernised <,,> like in <,> comparatively in twin cities like <,,> in  
Secunderabad also <,,> the people are quite different and <,,> the girls and  
the <,,> boys <,,> all they are <,,> more modernised <,,> than in Hyderabad  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#83:1:B>
Whereas in Hyderabad they still have the old cultures and <,,> so  
many things that even <,,> the parents they don't even let the girls <,> talk  
with the guys <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#84:1:B>
It is hidden talking like <,> they get a good punch at home or  
something like that <,,> <O> laughs </O> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#85:1:B>
But whereas in Secunderabad they are so fast they even go for <,>  
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then <,> so many other <,,> I  
mean extra <,> curricular <,> activities are going on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#86:1:B>
But whereas in Hyderabad they are only <,> stuck with their books  
and <,> home and work <w> that's </w> all like <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#87:1:B>
There is a lot of <}> <-> different </-> <+> difference </+> </}>  
between these two twin cities itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#88:1:B>
So then <,,> comparitively to north <,,> south is quite <,,> to see  
in study <,> point of view south is quite good <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#89:1:B>
Whereas in north <,> there is lot of activities <,> may be <w> it's  
</w> due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and  
<,> all those things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#90:1:B>
So in <,> north I should say they are more advanced than <,,> in  
study point of view they are not that <,,> uh good as good as <,,> in south  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#91:1:B>
So <,,> I mean that is the difference I find between this <,,> uh  
north and south <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#92:1:A>
And what about ragging difference between north and south <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#93:1:B>
Well the ragging in <,,> south is quite <,,> I mean <,,> quite  
cool I should say <,,> because you don't have any physical <,> torturement or  
anything like that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#94:1:B>
They just ask some <,> simple questions <,> regarding your biodata  
<,,> then your hobbies <,,> then <,,> they may ask you to sing a song <,> or  
dance <,> or ask for a treat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#95:1:B>
<w> That's </w> the maximum they do here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#96:1:B>
But whereas in north <,,> they <,,> literally kill the person like  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#97:1:B>
You know most of the <,,> people who <,> who go to <,> north for  
medical studies they are really scared <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#98:1:B>
I don't want to go there because they are <,> physically tortured  
like uh <,> sometimes they even ask them to go the morgery and <,,> at  
midnight twelve <w> O'clock </w> whereas everyone is so scared like <,> <O>  
laughs </O> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#99:1:A>
Yeah 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#100:1:B>
And thinking about <,,> dissection hall itself they really  
get scared and that also in the midnight uh <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#101:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#102:1:B>
So they asked them to go to the <,> morgery <,,> whereas <,,>  
in the morgery even the <,,> fresh bodies are <,,> I mean kept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#103:1:B>
So <,,> sometimes they <,,> I mean they ask the students to go to  
the <,,> dissection hall and identify <,,> so many things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#104:1:B>
At the same time <,,> some of their <,> same collegues <,> they  
must be hiding <,> I mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up  
suddenly so <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#105:1:B>
There <}> <-> was </-> <+> were </+> </}> <,> two cases <,> in  
north that <,,> two persons had died because of this type of ragging 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#106:1:A>
Yeah yeah <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#107:1:B>
And then 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#108:1:A>
It has been 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#109:1:B>
So far yeah <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#110:1:B>
So far what I have heard is that in north <,,> they have asked uh  
<,,> a guy <,,> they gave him uh <,> a huge <,,> I mean <,> piece of <,,> uh  
soap and they asked him to <,> they gave him some <,,> specific time and  
asked him to take <,> bath and finish that soap <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#111:1:B>
Well that <,,> guy <,> he was finding very difficult to do that  
and <,,> he tried his best to finish that soap <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#112:1:B>
So by the time he finished the soap he was <,> admitted in the  
hospital <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#113:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#114:1:B>
That <,> that serious he became <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#115:1:B>
Then uh <,> there are so many serious <,> ragging <,> done by the  
seniors in north <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#116:1:B>
But whereas in south like I feel the lecturers and the professors  
<,,> whoever in-charge then the principal they are <,,> controlling the  
students in that point of view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#117:1:B>
But in <,,> north <,,> they are not bothered <,> like <,> they  
just leave upto the students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#118:1:B>
So the <,> seniors really <,,> torture the <,> juniors <,,> and  
<,> I mean they find it difficult <,,> to stay there 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#119:1:B>
So many <,> students have left their course <,> just because of  
ragging <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#120:1:A>
<{> <[> So </[> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#121:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{> so far like <,> what I have heard about uh  
<,> one college is that one <,> guy was asked to go to the ladies hostel <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#122:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig> <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#123:1:B>
Uhn the <,,> warden was <,> a <,,> spinster so <,,> like <,>  
he has asked the <,,> guy to <,> I mean the senior has asked the guy to go it  
is <,> panties along <,> alone like <,> to go early in the morning and ask  
her what did <,> she do with her husband the previous night <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#124:1:B>
So <,> at the same time <,,> like he refused to do <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#125:1:B>
So <,> they asked him to <,> stand at the college gate <,> with  
the <,> panties alone 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#126:1:A>
Uhn <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#127:1:B>
So that <,,> that was when he <,> became mad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#128:1:B>
And he is really a <,> mental <,> off the person now at the moment  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#129:1:B>
So <,,> those are the differnces you can find like how <,> badly  
they are ragging in north and <,> south <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#130:1:B>
South how lenient they are <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#131:1:A>
So what you like <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#132:1:A>
Do you think that there should be ragging or not <,,> ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-090#133:1:B>
Well <,> in my point of view okay ragging means what they are  
doing in the south <,> I really appreciate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#134:1:B>
Unless you <,> rag your junior by asking so many <,> I mean  
whatever you want to ask <,,> that junior never bothers to say <quote> hi  
</quote> even <,> like in their later life <,> like <,,> when the college  
goes on smoothly like <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#135:1:B>
So <,,> in that point of view <,> ragging is <,,> good <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1A-090#136:1:B>
What I feel is <,,> so that you get to know the <,> junior and the  
junior comes to know who you are <,> and what a person you are <,,>

you just touch the dead bodies <,,> you feel something and then <,,> when you  
go back home you <,> specially <,> wash your hands in the dettol atleast for  
ten times and you just <,,> keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything  
and <,,> you know <w> that's </w> how it happens but <,,> slowly <,,> you
