<ICE-IND:W2D-011#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THOMAS </smallcaps> </bold> Easley, the
forty-year-old artist from California whose paintings are being exhibited
at Habiart, has arange of serious interests.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#5:1>
His metaphysics, deriving from Gurdjeff and Ouspensky and presented in
a style that smacks too much of revealation and the absolutism of its
authority, is inaccessible to low IQ types like me who need step by step
reasoning.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#6:1>
But his poetry has clarity, it yearns for a world cleansed of
cruelties and pain.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#7:1>
This aspect of his sensibility has contextual relevance, for the
proceeds from the sale of the works exhibited will go for the treatment of
Anshu Saxena, a teenager of Gaumukteshwar on whom some vandals sprayed
acid. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#8:1>
There seems to be only one painting directly related to this
tragedy and it suggests that while <w> Easley's </w> compassion is
genuine, his sensibility shies away from a direct encounter with the tragic.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#9:1>
One side of the <w> girl's </w> face has been totally disfigured and
will need repeated plastic surgery.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#10:1>
She is, therefore, constrained to wear a veil on this side.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#11:1>
In the painting, Easley has made the veil transparent.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#12:1>
He could thus have presented an image that could thrust deep into us
with a shaft of pain, an image of contrasts, of sadism cruelly mauling
life.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#13:1>
But in the painting, the side of the face seen under the veil is just
like the other side.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#14:1>
The picture has become an exercise in contrasting clear and muted
tones.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#15:1>
Is this carping criticism?

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#16:1>
We have to note the paradox that while cruelty has enormously
increased in the modern world, the abillity to look on it direct, to be
a vicarious victim of it, has been lost.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#17:1>
Perhaps we should recover the chilling but necessary courage to
look on Bhima drinking the blood of Dussasana as in Kathakali and, as
Unamuno said, on the emaciated, blook-stained Christ, the harsh Maria
Dolorosa rigid with grief. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#18:1>
We have had a spate of paintings on the Bhopal tragedy, the
biggest industrial disaster in history, but not one which I can remember
to have been anything more than yet another attempt at picture-making, yet
another instance of the cry of suffering breathed into a flute to become a
serene song, as Unamuno puts it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#19:1>
Francis of Assisi felt the cruel pains inflicted on the luckless so
intensely after, and because, he felt the tortures of Jesus so intensely that
the stigmata of the wounds appeared on his body too.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#20:1>
But Easley certainly cannot be singled out for this failure of the
modern sensibility.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#21:1>
The donated paintings include landscapes, nude and genre studies and
the last show some sympathetic identification with people in a casual
labourers in construction and other types. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#22:1>
Hieronymus Bosch, the medieval Flemish painter whose art
surprisingly anticipates modern surrealism, painted weired pictures where
creepers and flowers sprout from all the orifices, including the
unmentionable of human beings.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#23:1>
Medieval fears were strong in him and perhaps flowes represented
delight which was the <w> devil's </w> temptation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#24:1>
In the metamorphoses in the paintings of Laxman Pai ( Dhoomimal
Centre) there is mercifully no such inner conflict.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#25:1>
Tresses of hair growing into sheaves of golden grain, eyes
lengthening into birds, all suggest an interprenetration of man and nature, a
communion that leads to interbeing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#26:1>
However, this has been his style for years now and the lyricism is
fading somewhat was the familiarity.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#27:1>
But he has compensated this a little through a greater variety of
textures and a brighter palette with glowing, gem-like highlights.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#28:1>
The painting <quote> " Unrest-1989" </quote> stands apart and its
violently streaked sky with its plintered bars of fiery colour brings us
out of the bee-loud glade of the other pictures into the mess that has
become our social reality and about which we have to do something if we are
to survive! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#29:1>
A spate of group shows.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#30:1>
Among the young artists, mostly from the Jamia Millia, who exhibited
at Alliance Francaise, Seema Murtaza contributed promising studies of
peasant women, Moeen Fatima good portraits and Rajkumar Panwar terracotta
figurines of peasant types.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#31:1>
Recalling Sutainder <w> Soni's </w> whimsical surrealism was Bhim <w>
Malhotra's </w> photograph with clouds ( collaged) inside a drawing room.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#32:1>
The Triveni annual had a high standard, but with all participants
contributing works in their by now very familiar manner, comment would be a
repetition, though Shruti Gupta <w> Chandra's </w> drawings, mostly of
people at work, deserve mention.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#33:1>
The same is the general situaiton in the Display Gallery show
though Suraj <w> Ghai's </w> fine landscapes with their mood quality
linger in memory.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#34:1>
The Village Gallery presents some excellent graphics among them Uttam
<w> Basak's </w> wood intaglio with tragic overtones.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#35:1>
Mickey <w> patel's </w> portrait study in litho and Jayant <w>
Gajeria's </w> large woodcuts.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#36:1>
Considering that Sailoz Mookerjea taught at the Ukil School in the
old days, the group show by the final year students at AIFACS suggests that
it has not weathered the years too well. </p> <O> Photograph </O> <O> below

<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> watercolour exhibitions
which AIFACS has instituted as an annual feature have made a major
contribution to the revival of work and interest in the medium and with
Kanwal Krishna looking after the selection and judging, the Eighth Annual
maintains an excellent standard.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#41:2>
The medium is at its best in a lyrical response to nature and we
get the feel of space, clean air and quiet water in the river scenes of
Paresh Maity, the rapid play of light under a sky with swiftly racing clouds
in Gurao and the light, moist veil of mist in the mountainscape by Salim,
while Anita Lal manages to recapture the poetic impressionism of Whistler
where the landscape features melt into a mood.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#42:2>
Since the medium rules out corrections, portrait work in it can be
very exacting and Mahadeo Kamble has to be felicitated for his splendid
success here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#43:2>
Equal success cannot be claimed for the annual traditional art
exhibitions instituted by AIFACS.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#44:2>
Perhaps the concept itself was never fully clarified.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#45:2>
If there was no modulation, even mutations, in fact evolution in
tradition, we would all have been amoebae.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#46:2>
Perhaps, in next <w> year's </w> show which would be the Seventh
Annual, guidelines should be laid down making it clear that closely
copying the manner and idiom of Madhubani or Moghul or Rajput miniature is
not what is expected.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#47:2>
This is what we mostly get in the current show.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#48:2>
But there are a few works that charge traditional parameters with
startling originality.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#49:2>
With its rectilinear treatment of figures and decoratively curvaceous
drawing of the <w> serpent's </w> body, Balvant <w> Joshi's </w> <quote> "
Kaliya Daman" </quote> is a virile composition.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#50:2>
Even more imaginatively, Kiran Maini creates separate spaces for
episodes, overlaps them transparently in spite of the vibrant strength of
the ground colours and builds up an integrated composition based on the
Gita Govinda which retains the decorative quality of traditional painting but
brings in great sophistication. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#51:2>
The country of Halle in GDR has had historical associations with
India, for many of the professors of the Martin Luther University there
have been distinguished Indologists.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#52:2>
There is no dogmatic social realism in the exhibition of
contemporary art from Halle now on at Rabindra Bhavan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#53:2>
But there is sensitive reflection of the ambience as also its
problems.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#54:2>
If the quietly insinuating urban scenes painted in muted colours
by Mohwald and Schotte reflect the friendliness of the small town, and the
amused study of a family group by Wagenbritt is still kindly, we see the hard
psychological closure of a narcissism turned sour in a portrait by Reinel, of
a self that has become a self in opposition to the world in Triebsch.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#55:2>
Medieval Christian myth and metaphor return.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#56:2>
There is a superb etching in homage of Grunewald by Sitte, <w>
Bolldorf's </w> colour linocut <quote> " Pain" </quote> recalls the crucified
Christ, and the partner of the acrobat walking on a rail in <w> Pfeffer's
</w> stark etching <quote> " Balance" </quote> could be Death from a medieval
illustration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#57:2>
More fine graphics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#58:2>
Prints and drawings of Charles Stroh who recently conducted a
graphics workshop at Udaipur are on display at the American Center.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#59:2>
The assured technical mastery of Stroh comes out in all the media he
handles: pencil and conte, litho, silkscreen.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#60:2>
The sensuous curve of the drawing in the nude studies recalls
Ingres.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#61:2>
There is a whole series of self-portraits where Stroh is
alternately amused by and reconciled with himself.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#62:2>
But perhaps the creation that would dwell longest in remembrance are
the landscapes in litho, of woodlands and quiet nooks where a stream
broadens in a shallow basin to become a pool mirroring serene skies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#63:2>
Satish <w> Gupta's </w> exhibition ( Triveni) is fascinating both
for technical and aesthetic reasons.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#64:2>
The works are graphics on canvas, the unit plates themselves large,
the composition made far larger by using several of them, the plane of their
surface both dug in by deep and soft ground etching and raised up by
collaging separate etched metal segments, the final image dispensing with
multiple plates and impressions through the use of differential
viscosity in inking.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#65:2>
His earlier paintings were rapt musings, approaching the mood of the
<bold> haiku </bold> , the miniature poem of the Japanese.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#66:2>
Gupta has been attracted to that form and has a volume of his verse
in English modelled on the <bold> haiku </bold> , though the <w> latter's
</w> incredible economy of just seventeen syllables for the whole poem is
impossible to achieve in other languages.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#67:2>
Here the linkage between poem and visual is clear, especially in a
whole series of smaller compositions where Gupta works variations on an
unheard but sweeter music, the silent flute notes of evocative images based
on his <bold> haiku </bold> :

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#68:2>

<bold> <smallcaps> On </smallcaps> </bold> the occasion of the award
of its Fellowship to Bimal Dasgupta and Radha Mohan, the <mention> Lalit Kala
Akademi </mention> is holding exhibitions of their paintings at Rabindra
Bhavan.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#73:3>
In its first phase, <w> Dasgupta's </w> art was a lyrical homage to
the beauty of the earth in watercolour whose transparency and luminosity
could seize the immaculate quality of that beauty.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#74:3>
Later he turned to oils and acrylics where the main forms of his
compositions suggested continental drifts floating in the emerald spreads of
vast oceans, planets levitating in space.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#75:3>
Many vignettes of nature could be discovered here, but subtly
transformed and miniaturised as in the images reflected in small mirrors seen
in the genre paintings of Dutch masters like Jan Van Eyck.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#76:3>
But the overall impact was that of abstract art.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#77:3>
Paintings of this type are also on display.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#78:3>
But very recently, he seems to be returning to his first love,
landscape.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#79:3>
However, there is a subtle difference.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#80:3>
The extrovert delight in nature in all the plenitude of details has,
under the spell of the simplification involved in abstraction, changed to
evocation and suggestion, using the resources of poetic connotation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#81:3>
And for this kind of endeavour, Dasgupta has rediscovered that his
first medium, watercolour, is still the best. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#82:3>
A pioneer of Patna and eighty-three today, Radha Mohan has got
his Fellowship for reasons which have validity in weighing the varied
contributions that go into the growth of traditions, among which the
purely artistic may not always have had the major role.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#83:3>
The exhibition as well as the publication on his art indicate him
to be primarily or almost exclusively a portrait painter and some of the
portraits reveal understanding of character. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-011#84:3>
Tyeb Mehta ( Art Heritage) has voluntarily chosen the hard
discipline of a very restricted thematic parameter and in spite of the risks
of either monotony or preciosity in working variations within such
narrow options, has managed to create significance every time.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#85:3>
Spartan spareness has not had many admirers in history, but Ortega
had reminded us that it contributed the austere simplicity of the Doric
order.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#86:3>
<w> Tyeb's </w> approach has a similar patrician reserve and
authority.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#87:3>
The ground is monochrome of unmodulated colour.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#88:3>
When it is divided, the segments are geometrical with clean and
straight edges.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#89:3>
The figures too are in monochrome with no tonal gradations.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#90:3>
This kind of palette, especially with the choice of bright yet
soothing colours except when explosive contrasts are intended ( as in the
blood-red mouth of Kali), has a telling impact.

<ICE-IND:W2D-011#91:3>
The figure that falls or is truncated by a diagonal cut right through
the frame may or may not have reference to the predicament of modern man, but
the social reference has no ambiguity whatever in paintings like that of the
<indig> rickshaw- </indig> puller. </I>
