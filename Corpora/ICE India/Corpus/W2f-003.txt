SHORT STORY

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#2:1>
by Ruskin Bond

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#3:1>
<h> <bold> An island of trees </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> KOKI </smallcaps> </bold> and her grandmother were
sitting on a string cot in the shade of an old jack-fruit tree, and
Grandmother was talking about her father and his great love for trees and
flowers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#5:1>
Grandmother said : I was never able to get over the feeling
that plants and trees loved my father with as much tenderness as he loved
them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#6:1>
I was sitting beside him on the verandah steps one morning, when I
noticed the tendril of a creeping vine that was trailing near my feet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#7:1>
As we sat there in the soft winter sunshine, I saw that the tendril
was moving very slowly away from me and towards my father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#8:1>
Twenty minutes later it had crossed the verandah step and was touching
my <w> father's </w> feet. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#9:1>
There is probably a scientific explanation for the <w> plant's
</w> behaviour - - something to do with light and warmth - - but I like to
think that it moved simply because it was fond of my father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#10:1>
One felt like drawing close to him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#11:1>
Sometimes when I sat alone beneath a tree I would feel a little
lonely or lost.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#12:1>
But as soon as my father joined me, the garden would become a happy
place, the tree itself more friendly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#13:1>
Your great-grandfather had served many years in the Indian Forest
Service and so it was natural that he should know and understand and like
trees.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#14:1>
On his retirement he built this bungalow on the outskirts fo the
town, planting the trees that you see around it now: limes, mangoes, oranges
and guavas; also jacaranda and laburnum and the Persian lilac.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#15:1>
In our valley, given the chance, plants and trees grow tall and
strong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#16:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> OF </smallcaps> </bold> course there were other
trees here before the house was built, including an old <indig> peepul
</indig> which had forced its way through the walls of an old, abandoned
temple, knocking the bricks down with its vigorous growth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#17:1>
<indig> Peepul </indig> trees are great show-offs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#18:1>
Even when there is no breeze, their broad-chested, slim-waisted
leaves will spin like tops, determined to attract your attention and invite
you into the shade. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#19:1>
What happened to the temple, asked Koki. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#20:1>
Well, my mother wanted the <indig> peepul </indig> tree cut down,
but my father said he would save both the tree and the temple.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#21:1>
So he rebuilt the temple around the tree, and there it is, on the
other side of the wall.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#22:1>
The tree protects the temple, and the temple protects the tree.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#23:1>
People from these parts feel <w> there's </w> a friendly tree-spirit
dwelling there, and they bring offerings of flowers and leave them at the
base of the tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#24:1>
Did you know that I used to climb trees when I was a girl ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#25:1>
This jack-fruit was my favourite tree, <w> it's </w> quite easy to
climb.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#26:1>
You climb it too, don't you ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#27:1>
Another good tree was the banyan behind the house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#28:1>
Its spreading branches, which hung to the ground and took root again,
formed a number of twisting passageways.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#29:1>
The tree was older than the house, older than my grandparents.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#30:1>
I could hide in its branches, behind a screen of thick green leaves,
and spy on the world below. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#31:1>
Yes, the banyan tree was a world in itself, populated with small
animals and large insects.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#32:1>
While the leaves were still pink and tender, they would be visited
by the delicate map butterfly, who left her eggs to their care.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#33:1>
The <quote> ` honey' </quote> on the leaves - - a sweet, sticky smear
- - also attracted the little striped squirrels, who soon grew used to
having me in the tree and became quite bold, accepting food from my hand.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#34:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> AT </smallcaps> </bold> night the tree was
visited by the hawk-cuckoo.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#35:1>
Its shrill nagging cry kept us awake on hot summer nights.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#36:1>
We call the bird <indig> <quote> ` pipiha' </quote> </indig> , which
means <quote> ` rain is coming!'</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#37:1>
But father said that according to Englishmen living in India, it
seemed to be shouting up and up the scale : <quote> ` Oh dear, oh dear !

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#38:1>
How very hot <w> it's </w> getting !

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#39:1>
We feel it ... we feel it ... WE FEEL IT!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#40:1>
Well, the banyan has long since gone.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#41:1>
It came down in a storm, aerial roots and all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#42:1>
Father planted another, but as you can see, <w> it's </w> still
quite a young tree, the banyan takes a long time to grow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#43:1>
Your great-grandfather wasn't content with planting trees in our
garden or near the house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#44:1>
During the rains he would walk into the scrubland beyond the
river-bed, armed with cuttings and saplings, and he would plant them out
there, hoping to create a forest.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#45:1>
But grazing cattle and goats always finished them off. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#46:1>
<quote> " No-one ever goes there," </quote> I said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#47:1>
<quote> " Who will see your forest?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#48:1>
<quote> " We are not planting it for people to see," </quote>
said my father.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#49:1>
<quote> " We are planting for the earth itself - - and for the birds
and animals who live on it and need more food and shelter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#50:1>
<quote> " He told me how mankind, and not only wild creatures,
needed trees - - for keeping the desert away, for attracting rain, for
preventing the banks of rivers from being washed away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#51:1>
But everywhere people are cutting down the trees without planting
others.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#52:1>
If that continues, then one day there will be no forests at all and
the world will become one great desert!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#53:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> thought of a world
without trees became a sort of nightmare for me - - <w> it's </w> one
reason why I shall never want to live on the treeless Moon ! - - and I helped
my father in his treeplanting with even greater enthusiasm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#54:1>
<quote> " One day the trees will move again," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#55:1>
<quote> " They have been standing still for thousands of years, but
one day they will move again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#56:1>
There was a time when trees could walk about like people, but then
along came a terrible demon and cast a spell over them, rooting them to one
place.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#57:1>
But they are always trying to move - - see how they reach out with
their arms!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#58:1>
On one of our walks along the river banks, about a mile
upstream from here, we found an island, a small rocky island in the middle
of the riverbed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#59:1>
You know what this riverbed is like - - dry in summer but flooded in
the monsoon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#60:1>
A young tamarind tree was growing in the middle of the island, and my
father said, <}> <-> ' </-> <quote> <+> " </+> If a tamarind can grow here,
so can other trees." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#61:1>
As soon as the monsoon rains arrived - - and while the river
could still be crossed - - we set out with a number of mango, laburnum,
hibiscus and coraltree saplings and cuttings, and spent the better part of
a day planting them on the little island. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#62:1>
We made one more visit to the island before the monsoon
finally set in.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#63:1>
Most of the plants looked quite healthy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#64:1>
The monsoon season is the best time for rambling about, said the
Grandmother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#65:1>
At every turn there is something new to see.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#66:1>
Out of earth and rock and leafless bough, the magic touch of the
summer rain has brought forth new life and verdure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#67:1>
You can almost see the broad-leaved vines growing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#68:1>
Plants spring up in the most unlikely places.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#69:1>
A <indig> peepul </indig> took root on the roof; a mango sprouted on
the window-sill.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#70:1>
My father and I did not want to remove them, but they had to go if
the house was to be prevented from falling down ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#71:1>
<quote> " <bold> <smallcaps> IF </smallcaps> </bold> you two want to
live in a tree, <w> that's </w> all right by me," </quote> said my mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#72:1>
<quote> " But I like having a roof over my head, and <w> I'm </w> not
going to have it brought down by a hanging forest.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#73:1>
Already I can see roots coming through the ceiling!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#74:1>
The visiting trees were carefully removed and transplanted in
the garden.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#75:1>
Whenever we came indoors from our gardening and sat down to a
meal, a ladybird or a caterpillar would invariably walk off our sleeves and
wander about the kitchen, much to my <w> mother's </w> annoyance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#76:1>
There were flowers in the garden, too; my mother loved scented
flowers, like roses and sweet-peas and jasmine and Queen of the Night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#77:1>
But my father and I found trees more exciting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#78:1>
They kept growing and changing and attracting birds and other
visitors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#79:1>
The banyan tree really came to life during the monsoon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#80:1>
The branches were thick with scarlet figs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#81:1>
We couldn't eat the berries, but the many birds that gathered in the
tree - - gossipy rosy-pastors, quarrelsome <indig> mynas </indig> ,
cheerful <indig> bulbuls </indig> and coppersmiths, and sometimes a noisy,
bullying crow - - would feast on them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#82:1>
And when night fell and the birds were resting, the dark flying-foxes
flapped heavily about the tree, chewing and munching loudly as they
clambered <O> sketch </O> over the branches. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#83:1>
The tree crickets were a band of willing artists who started
singing at almost any time of the day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#84:1>
At the height of the monsoon, the banyan tree was like an
orchestra with the musicians constantly tuning up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#85:1>
A small flute in my hands, I would add my shrill piping to that of
the crickets and cicadas.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#86:1>
But they must have thought poorly of my piping, because whenever I
played, the insects fell silent ! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#87:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> WHEN </smallcaps> </bold> I grew up, I was
married and went to live with my husband in Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#88:1>
Your father was my second child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#89:1>
We were in Bombay for many years, and I could only visit my parents
here once or twice in all that time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#90:1>
I had no brothers, and when they died they left the house to me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#91:1>
It will be yours one day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#92:1>
Would you rather live here or in that poky little house in the town ?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#93:1>
Here, said Koki.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#94:1>
But only if you are here too, Granny. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#95:1>
The tree will be here, said Granny. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#96:1>
And what about the island ? asked Koki.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#97:1>
The trees you planted with your father - - are they still there ?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#98:1>
You can see them for yourself if you feel like a walk.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#99:1>
But <w> I'll </w> tell you what I found when I came to live here
again after twenty years or more.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#100:1>
I walked out of the old house and took the same path that my father
and I used to take during our walks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#101:1>
It was February, I remember, and as I looked across the dry
riverbed, my eye was immediately caught by the spectacular red plumes of
the coral blossom.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#102:1>
In contrast with the dry riverbed, the island was a small green
paradise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#103:1>
When I walked over to the trees, I noticed that a number of parrots
had come to live in them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#104:1>
A small spotted deer scampered away to hide in a thicket.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#105:1>
And a wild pheasant challenged me with a mellow <quote> `
who-are-you, who-are-you ...' </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#106:1>
But the trees seemed to know me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#107:1>
I am sure they whispered among themselves and beckoned me nearer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#108:1>
I ran my hands over their bark and it was like touching the hands of
old friends.

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#109:1>
And looking around, I noticed that other small trees and wild plants
and grasses had sprung up under the protection of those who we had planted
there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-003#110:1>
The trees had multiplied!

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#111:1>
The forest was on the move!

<ICE-IND:W2F-003#112:1>
In one small corner of the world, my <w> father's </w> dream was
coming true, and the trees were walking again ! </p> <*> filled circle </*>
</I>
