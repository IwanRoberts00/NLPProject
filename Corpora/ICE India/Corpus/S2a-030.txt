<ICE-IND:S2A-030#1:1:A>
In English studies <,,> there is <-> unit </-> <,,> module two
<,,> unit <,,> two point two point three <,,> teaching literature in English
<,> what are the approaches to the teaching of literature in English <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#2:1:A>
What are the emergent areas in literature in English ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#3:1:A>
What are the research possibilities <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#4:1:A>
So <,,> <}> <-> <.> a a </.> </-> <=> and </=> </}> also uh <,>
module three <,,> you have uh <,,> no I am sorry uh two point three <,>
module three <,> research areas in English studies what are the new critical
tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#5:1:A>
What are the trends in contemporary criticism <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#6:1:A>
What are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic
etcetera <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#7:1:A>
So it is hoped that some of the things that I <,,> speak to you
about will <,,> inspire <,> one or two <,,> to <,,> go along these lines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#8:1:A>
Of the two lectures <,> first uh <,> on <,> <indig> auchitya
</indig> <,> as a <}> <-> <.> cri </.> </-> <=> criterion </=> </}> of <,,>
literary assessment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#9:1:A>
Yesterday <,> I <,> distributed a handout <,> listing the eight
major theories <,> not the minor ones <,> eight major theories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#10:1:A>
And the first of these <,,> which is the most <,> notorious <indig>
rasa </indig> theory <,> we discussed yesterday <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#11:1:A>
Today I am taking up <,,> what is listed there as number four <,>
<indig> auchitya </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#12:1:A>
I have a <,> for distribution <,,> a bibliography <,,> a select
bibliography of books and articles on the application of <,> Indian literary
theory classical Indian literary theory <,> to uh <}> <-> <.> litera </.>
</-> <=> literary </=> </}> works <,,> especially <,,> uh to modern writings
<,,> uh <,,> which are available in English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#13:1:A>
So you will get a list <,,> and uh you can you can choose <,,> I
won't be commenting on that list today <,> but I shall like to <,,> comment
on this yesterday we didn't have the <,> black <,> board <,> today we have
something which is not quite so black but <,,> <w> we'll </w> be able to use
that <,> <O> clearing the throat </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#14:1:A>
The <,,> <&> BB writing </&> these diagram I mention briefly <,,>
which is like uh teaching science in the <,,> in some of the old colleges <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#15:1:A>
Imagine this is a test tube <,> because in the laboratory they
didn't have a real test tube <,> so everything was <,> the work of
imagination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#16:1:A>
But today I think I will <,,> draw the diagram which is provided by
<,,> Kuppuswamy Shastri as I mentioned yesterday <,> and uh <,,> that two
triangles <,,> and two circle <,> indicate the <,> relative importance <,> of
the eight <,> fold system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#17:1:A>
Uh there are some college who would <,,> prefer one <,,> theory to
the other theory <,,> but I <,> I have a attitude that each theory has its
own <,> specific application <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#18:1:A>
No single theory <,,> not even from the west <,> will explain the
whole of the literary process <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#19:1:A>
And the relevance of the theory depends on how <,,> liberally <,,>
how critically <,,> how meaningfully we apply this <,> theory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#20:1:A>
What can a poor theory do <,,> if the user of the theory is not <,>
imaginative enough to apply it <,> intelligently <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#21:1:A>
So <,> we have the <,> three major theories <indig> dhwani <,,>
rasa </indig> <,> and <indig> anumana </indig> <,,> or <indig> anumiti <,,>
anumiti waad </indig> or <indig> anumanaya </indig> <,,> inference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#22:1:A>
These three are linked together <,> by <,> <indig> auchitya
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#23:1:A>
That is without <indig> auchitya </indig> <,,> neither <indig>
dhwani </indig> <,> nor <indig> rasa </indig> <,> nor <indig> anumiti
</indig> by itself can deliver the goods <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#24:1:A>
Everything has to be <,,> used in a proper way <,,> that applies to
the application of any literary theory as well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#25:1:A>
The blind application of any theory <,> will not <,,> help us in
appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#26:1:A>
The smaller <,,> triangle <,,> <indig> guna </indig> a <indig> guna
</indig> <,> theory <,> the <indig> alankara </indig> theory <,,> and <indig>
riti </indig> <,> theory <,> these are of different schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#27:1:A>
And I have given the <,,> names of the people <,> major critics who
have advocated this <,> with the basic texts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#28:1:A>
And linking <indig> guna alankara </indig> and <indig> riti
</indig> <,,> we have the <,> uh smaller circle <,> which will represent
<indig> vakrokti </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#29:1:A>
For most of these translations are available in English but as I
said <,> translations were made by <,> Sanskrit scholars who knew <,,> their
kind of English <,> and therefore <,,> uh the translations may not satisfy
the requirements of <,,> teachers of English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#30:1:A>
But it is good if teachers of English can <,> take kindly to some
of these tools of research <,> and develop them <,> in the complete
confidence that <,,> we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we
ought to do that not merely <,> borrow them wholesale <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#31:1:A>
So unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to
help us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#32:1:A>
We have to deal with modern literature <,> we have to deal with
literature written in a foreign language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#33:1:A>
And uh we have the gap of <,,> thousands of years <,> atleast two
thousand years perhaps <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#34:1:A>
So we have to take these into account <,,> and uhm what we get from
these texts is only the insights <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#35:1:A>
Some <,,> evidence of <,> efforts made <,,> by a people so long ago
<,> to understand the literary process which <,> which in fact defies
understanding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#36:1:A>
No <,> poet no <,,> musician will explain to us everything about
his own art <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#37:1:A>
Musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen
to me <,> I won't <,> talk <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#38:1:A>
It is a musicologist who will talk about it <,> and he can do that
because his <,> mastery is comparatively <,> limited <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#39:1:A>
There are many things which cannot be <,,> uh talked about <,>
which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#40:1:A>
So <}> <-> <.> ther </.> </-> <=> there </=> </}> is an element of
mystery and we have <,> eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of
literary <,> creativity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#41:1:A>
We will take up <,,> this <indig> auchitya </indig> <,> theory
today <,> and uhm <,> I will try to <,> apply it <,,> to <,,> Sophocles
Edipus <,,> Rex Edipus the king <,,> a Greek play <,,> which is cutting
across <,,> uh <,> not only time but also space <,,> not because the Greeks
had come here <,,> at the time of the Chanakya serial <,,> but because <,,>
uh there is a common ground <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#42:1:A>
The humanist <,> outlook says that <,> there must be <,> certain
common grounds but you have to dig deep <,> may not be on the surface <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#43:1:A>
At the appropriate level you will find the connections <,,> just as
we can discover that we are related to <,,> the Eskimos in some <,,> way if
we go back <,,> far behind in history <,,> <O> clearing the throat </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#44:1:A>
The whole paper has been written out <,> uhm and you will get
copies <,> before it appears in <,,> some book <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#45:1:A>
So I will <,,> read it out with some comments here and there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#46:1:A>
Now scholars from the time of Bharata <,,> have been conscious of
this principle of <indig> auchitya </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#47:1:A>
It was Shemendra of the eleventh century <,,> who devoted a whole
treaties <,,> to its discussion <,> and thereby raised it to the level of a
basic requisite of all successful literary creations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#48:1:A>
Bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures <indig> guna
</indig> <,> or qualities and eschews or removes <,> blemishes or <indig>
doshas </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#49:1:A>
According to him the Bharata <,> the violation of <indig> auchitya
</indig> of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten
<,,> identified <indig> doshas </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#50:1:A>
That doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of
blemishes <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#51:1:A>
Ten have been identified <,> because uh <,> you can't <,> uh list
all possible types of <,> blemishes <,> we categorise <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#52:1:A>
That we do in modern times also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#53:1:A>
The concept of <indig> auchitya </indig> is employed in Bharatas
prescriptions <,> for the successful staging of plays <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#54:1:A>
Although the word <indig> auchitya </indig> might not have been
used by him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#55:1:A>
In the same way Bharata then <O> one word </O> Vamana Anandvasna
<,> have all recognised the importance of <indig> auchitya </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#56:1:A>
But it was left to Shemendra as I said the earlier <,> to project
the view that <indig> auchitya </indig> is a fundamental principle <,,> and
that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is
ignored <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#57:1:A>
So <indig> rasa </indig> <,> without <indig> auchitya </indig> will
not work <,,> that is called <indig> rasa auchitya </indig> <,,> he list them
all <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#58:1:A>
Shemendra has identified <,> twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects
or areas in which <indig> auchitya </indig> can be perceived <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#59:1:A>
Now we must remember that these are <,,> these texts have come to
us in a mangled form <,,> parts are missing <,,> and the works of many
scholars have totally disappeared <,,> they are only remembered as <,,>
abstract names <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#60:1:A>
Uh but what what has been saved or salvaged <,,> gives us some idea
of what can be done with some of these tools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#61:1:A>
These may be brought under five or six broad heads <,,> these
twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed <,> under names for
instance <,> <indig> pada vakya prabandha </indig> <,> uh I have a <,,> list
of uh these items and their translations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#62:1:A>
I think <w> I'll </w> read the <,,> English translations also you
know <,> the the <,> <indig> auchitya </indig> at the sentence level <,,> is
called uh <indig> vakya auchitya <,> auchitya </indig> at the discourse level
<,> is called <indig> prabandharth auchitya </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#63:1:A>
Then <,,> we have items under <indig> kavya shastra <,> guna
alankara </indig> and <indig> rasa </indig> <,,> that is uh under metaphor
<indig> kavya shastra </indig> and under poetics we have certain items <,,>
uh like <indig> rasa auchitya alankara auchitya guna auchitya </indig> <,> so
<indig> guna </indig> by itself will not be a <indig> guna </indig> <,> if it
is in the wrong place <,,> if it is not used with <,> propriety <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#64:1:A>
On the other hand <,,> what may be called a <indig> dosha </indig>
by itself <,> may become a <indig> guna </indig> if it is <,> used with
<indig> auchitya </indig>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#65:1:A>
Yesterday we pointed out that uh <,> <indig> jugupsa </indig> <,,>
and uh <indig> bibhatsa </indig> which we find in uhm uhm <,> Naipaul <,> may
be considered <indig> gunas </indig> in his type of work <,> not in somebody
elses <,> kind of work <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#66:1:A>
So there is a kind of <,> uh a justification on the basis of the
appropriateness of the whole thing to the <,> literary context <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#67:1:A>
Under <indig> vyakarna </indig> <,> which is the major concern of
these uh <,> scholars <,,> we have <,,> <indig> pada kriya karaga <,> linga
vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava </indig> and <,> <indig> kala </indig> <,>
or uh words level <,> verb level <,> case <,> gender <,> the appropriate
gender has to be used

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#68:1:A>
I will <,> in my comment on uhm <,> Sophocles play <,> I will
comment on some of these <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#69:1:A>
Uh the use of number <,> use of adjective the use of preposition
<,> the use of article use of tense <,,> there should be <,> appropriateness
in all this grammatical features as well <,> in a <,> perfect work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#70:1:A>
But perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to <,>
identify violations of these <indig> auchitya </indig> which is called
<indig> auchitya bhanga </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#71:1:A>
Under <indig> loktantra </indig> <,,> Shemendra lists <,> as I said
yesterday <indig> desa <,> kula </indig> and <indig> vrata </indig> <,> or
place <,> race <,,> and conduct <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#72:1:A>
And there <,> you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#73:1:A>
If it doesn't <,,> suit <,> the particular class or race that is
presented in a work

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#74:1:A>
For example if the <,> <indig> nishada </indig> character the
woodsman character in a play <,> speaks a high level Sanskrit <,> utterance
you know that will be inappropriate <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#75:1:A>
So <,> propriety or appropriateness <,,> has to be observed in the
kind of characters that is presented <,> and that was the <,> idea <,,>
otherwise it can violate

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#76:1:A>
So there is a <,> chance for <,,> sociological criticism to find
its way if this is expanded but unfortunately <,> uh it had not been done in
ancient India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#77:1:A>
Then under the <,> title under the section <indig> kavi </indig>
<,,> or the poet <,> we have a <,,> <indig> tatva </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-030#78:1:B>
What is <indig> vrata vratasan </indig> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-030#79:1:A>
<indig> Vrata </indig> is conduct <,,> behavior <,,>
appropriate behaviour for that man you know

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#80:1:A>
If a priest is presented as a character I think he has to <,>
conduct himself in that way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#81:1:A>
That <w> that's </w> the meaning I give to it you know uh uh <,> I
think I have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#82:1:A>
And uhm when I have the term <indig> loktantra </indig> and <w>
that's </w> <indig> kula </indig> and <indig> vrata </indig> I think <,> we
have to get at them implied meaning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#83:1:A>
Literary criticism is also <,> interpretation of critical theories
not only <,> critical works I mean creative works <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#84:1:A>
Interpretation of critical works also has to be done <,> that is
what uh <,> Abhinav Gupta did to <mention> Anandvardhana </mention> when he
wrote <mention> Lochana </mention> <,> as a commentary <,> on uh <indig>
dhavnyaloka </indig> <,,> <w> it's </w> an explication <,> <w> it's </w> a
creative <,> expansion of the basic ideas of <mention> Anandvardhana
</mention> <,> which had continued for uh <,> centuries until everything
seems to have stopped <,> with Jagannath Pandit and Appaya <?> Richir </?>
and that is the thread we have to pick up <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#85:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very un <,> palatable to English teachers <,> to try
to do something which they have not <,> done <,,> thirty forty years ago <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#86:1:A>
Uh and the <,> Indian language teachers are also very reluctant to
do this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#87:1:A>
They haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't
<,> seem to apply this to any modern novel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#88:1:A>
<w> Premchand's </w> novels could be <,,> discussed in the light of
some of these <,> a total interpretation of Tagore <,> is possible but <,> we
have failed to do that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#89:1:A>
And uh <,> I am here to <,> pain you by saying that we haven't done
many of the things <,> and explanation is <,> the British were there and we
could not do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#90:1:A>
An English teacher need not feel that English is the last vistage
of colonialism you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#91:1:A>
Teachers of English are not yet to perpetuate <,> uh western values
but they can <,> accept <,> everything from the west provided they are
understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#92:1:A>
Then uh <,> <indig> tatva <,> satva </indig> we have the <,,> uh
<O> clearing the throat </O> the <,> the principles observed <,,> the level
of consciousness of <indig> satva <,,> abhipraya </indig> or the intention
<,,> <indig> swabhava </indig> or character <,,> and characterisation which
<-> is </-> becomes uh very important <,> substance imagination situation
thought name in the naming of characters <,,> in <indig> aashirwad </indig>
or benediction <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#93:1:A>
So in every aspect if you take a <,,> play for instance <,> you
will find examples of all these <,,> and a a total interpretation of any
single play by using all these insights <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#94:1:A>
Now some of them may not be applicable <,> to certain works <,,>
every theory has its <,> built-in <,> limitation <,> and a theory survives
because of its acceptance of certain limitations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#95:1:A>
If we recognise the limitation we can make use of it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#96:1:A>
And uh if doesn't work <,> throw away the theory <,> and not the
literary work <,> this is the basic principle <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#97:1:A>
A theory may not apply because <,> a theory is a very broad
generalisation <,> <w> it's </w> only a model <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#98:1:A>
And under <indig> kavyangas </indig> which are not totally listed
<,,> three have been <,,> uh identified <indig> patra <,> prameya </indig>
and <,> <indig> sandarbha </indig> <,> characterisation or <indig> rabatra
</indig> or <indig> patra </indig> <,> and <indig> prameya </indig> or theme
<,> and <indig> sandarbha </indig> or context <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#99:1:A>
So uh if <,> a uh good interpreter of this theory can <,> develop
even as Shemendra <,,> discussed this theory in a book <O> one word </O>
study <,,> in the eleventh century <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#100:1:A>
We could <,,> elaborate each of these <,,> and give it meaning
because <,> <w> it's </w> a part of a total scheme <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-030#101:1:A>
And if you find any one of these not applicable to a <,>
particular work I think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being
that is how literary criticism is possible <,,> </I>
