<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#1:1:A>
Good afternoon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#2:1:A>
We have once again a very hot day here but <,> much more still than
it was yesterday <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#3:1:A>
And let me start once again by <,> welcoming my colleagues Atul
Premnarayan <,> Rakesh Sharma and our expert <,> Sumant Mishra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#4:1:A>
Atul <,> are you going to sweat <,,> as you did yesterday watching
the match or in the heat ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#5:1:B>
Well we did all enjoy the kind of Tennis Ravi that we are going
to watch <,,> as all the four players are going to battle out very very
exciting doubles match after one all last evening <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#6:1:B>
In fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops
of <,> delicious uh soft drinks round

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#7:1:C>
Soft drinks

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#8:1:A>
Let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#9:1:A>
That there is some good news as far as India is concerned Leander
Paes is fit <,,> and is back on the court

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#10:1:A>
He is going to partner Ramesh Krishnan <,,> in the crucial doubles
tie <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#11:1:A>
And uh <,,> with that uh <,> good news with us <,,> I think <w>
it's </w> a good idea if we start with Suman than <,> lets see what he thinks
this match is going to be like <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#12:1:D>
Well to <,,> begin with I noticed Leander Paes has got those
<,,> ankle <?> fringe </?> he is wearing <,,> when he went to Australia so
<,,> lets come to the match of <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#13:1:D>
I think <w> it's </w> this is a crucial match <,,> although I feel
that they have played as with the same players <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#14:1:D>
We have a better than <,,> fifty fifty chance winning both singles
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#15:1:D>
But <,> they will both be tough matches

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#16:1:D>
So the doubles in any case is very crucial <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#17:1:D>
This <,> the Koreans have seem they were good reputation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#18:1:D>
But <,,> they hadn't played I mean Ramesh there makes a bit
different because <,> he he is one of those steady players which create the
opening and Leander has taken to finish them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#19:1:D>
In a good doubles team <,,> there is always one person who is very
steady <,> keeps getting everything opening the other finishing <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#20:1:D>
You had the examples of John Macandro and <.> Kan </.> <,,> and
Peter Flemming <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#21:1:D>
Flemming was a <,,> mm and <,> so anyway so <,,> I think the
players are topping up <,> now at the side <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#22:1:A>
Rakesh <,> you tell <,,> our viewers would like to hear in
Hindi <,,> what <,> this doubles is going to be like <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#23:1:A>
Well <,,> <w> it's </w> always <,> a bit of psychological
advantages uh <,> you had a good victory behind you isn't it <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#24:1:A>
But on the other hand <,> Ramesh is <,> an extremely experience
player with a vast number of uh <,> victories <,> of all kind behind him <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#25:1:A>
I think the most important point that we might like to watch today
is how he combines with Leander Paes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#26:1:A>
Uh <,> I rather imagine that Paes is going to take the forehand <,>
court Suman

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#27:1:D>
Well I just got to mention this the way they standing <,> the
first round they played in Jaipur <{> <[> about </[> five weeks ago <,>
Ramesh took the right court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#28:1:D>
Uh today I think they have decided so <,,> let us how this works
out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#29:1:D>
I would have preferred Ramesh taking the left court <,,> because in
<,> the steady player always takes the left court

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#30:1:B>
<[> Ramesh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#31:1:A>
Also I think that uh <,> we <,> watched yesterday that this
tendency of Paes to block the backhand return <,,> uh can prove to be a bit
of disadvantage in in doubles

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#32:1:A>
Because it gives <,> a lot of time for the opponent to <}> <-> <.>
re </.> </-> <,> <=> recoup </=> </}> his uh <,,> stamina or run quickly or
get back to position quickly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#33:1:A>
So I would imagine that uh <,> uh more attacking left hand court
player is more vital aspect <,> in this particular game <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#34:1:A>
So we will have to see how the strategy works <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#35:1:A>
Uh Ramesh and Leander Paes <,> uh have played only once before
Rakesh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#36:1:B>
But they couldn't uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#37:1:A>
Atul uh <,,> may be you would like to comment a little bit but
I will ask you a question <,,> one possible reason for this uh <,> strategy
of taking the left court by Ramesh Krishnan could be that the <,> Koreans are
putting in a left hander <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#38:1:A>
And therefore really they will have two right <,> court players
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#39:1:B>
Exactly I was just going to say this Ravi <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#40:1:B>
In fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on
the outside courts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#41:1:B>
And both the Korean stars were practising only serves from the left
court <,> and not from the right court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#42:1:B>
Now Ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful
backhand which he can <,> tip <,> chipping it very well bringing the <,>
opponent close to the net

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#43:1:B>
Because the server will be at the base line <,> and he will have to
come up for the server volley tandum <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#44:1:B>
Just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that
Leander Paes is wearinng <,> ankle pads today <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#45:1:B>
He put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was
warming up with his father on the outside courts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#46:1:B>
Trying it for the first time as I asked him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#47:1:B>
And Ramanathan Krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had
in the right ankle <,,> would not be a hindrance at all at this stage <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#48:1:A>
Uhm <,> well that <w> we'll </w> have to see <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#49:1:D>
The other thing very important is the <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#50:1:E>
India is represented by <,,> Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes
<,,> <O> applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#51:1:E>
Korea is represented by <,,> Chang Jong and Lee Chong Wo <,,> <O>
applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#52:1:E>
India has won the toss <,,> and elected to serve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#53:1:E>
Time <,,> till the pairs play <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#54:1:A>
The umpire is <,,> coming right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#55:1:A>
And one of the <,> uh interesting thing that <,> that happen in
this Davis Cup ties I think that <,,> India has won the toss in every match

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#56:1:A>
Haven't we so far <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#57:1:B>
So far

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#58:1:A>
Ramesh Krishnan won his toss <,,> Leander Paes won his <,,>
and now the doubles team has gone across the court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#59:1:A>
So <,,> Ramesh <,,> and Leander will play from the <,,> southern
end <,,> near commentators box end <,,> and probably Ramesh will serve we
will have to see in a minute <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#60:1:A>
In the meanwhile <,> once again to the uhm <,> to the Koreans Atul
<,,> uh this is going to be very tough for the Indian because <,> both the
players will play on their forehand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#61:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> going to be uh a very much more attacking
combination than uh <,> the normal right handed players

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#62:1:B>
Well I think it will be very difficult for the Indian players
to pass them particularly Ramesh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#63:1:B>
And uh the result that I could see yesterday in the <,> two sets
that they played you know really serving very very powerfully <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#64:1:B>
And both of them with strong shoulders <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#65:1:B>
Both the Korean stars were reintroduce but they were <O> one word
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#66:1:A>
And Leander now is ready to serve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#67:1:A>
The first service of the match <,,> crucial match <,,> important
match

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#68:1:A>
I hope this can excite us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#69:1:A>
And Leander <,,> ready to serve <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#70:1:E>
Love fifteen <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#71:1:A>
Very good volley there but <,> rather unlucky

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#72:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#73:1:A>
Bit too long <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#74:1:A>
He played the shot and Leander he saw the ball <,,> all the way to
<,> saw <,> Chang move <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#75:1:A>
And he was really good to chase that volley quite easily <,,> to an
empty court <,> fifteen O <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#76:1:B>
Oh <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#77:1:E>
Fifteen O <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#78:1:A>
Another service <,,> take <,,> Chang goes there flack backhand
<,,> down the line <,,> no mistakes at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#79:1:A>
Fifteen <,> O <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#80:1:A>
Very confidently played by Leander

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#81:1:E>
Thirty O <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#82:1:A>
He was back quick <,,> waiting for the volley <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#83:1:A>
Very good display at the match <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#84:1:A>
Ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#85:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#86:1:A>
Seems to be running alright <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#87:1:A>
Thirty O <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#88:1:E>
Forty thirty <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#89:1:A>
The first time in the game Leander has gotten on to a lead <,>
forty thirty a good service

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#90:1:A>
Serving wide on forehand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#91:1:A>
Very easy <,> smash for Ramesh Krishnan <,,> forty thirty first
game <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#92:1:E>
Leander <,> forty <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#93:1:A>
A very good beginning for India no Suman <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#94:1:D>
But I like the way uh <,,> Leander change over to the forehand
got them on the forehand <,> because <O> one word </O> been consisted in
being serving on the backhand <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#95:1:D>
But now when he won four and forty more <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#96:1:D>
The other point I think is <,> important Korean going to do a lot
of interceptions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#97:1:D>
You know self systems particularly

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#98:1:D>
So <,,> let it will depend on the <,> Indian service return also
how

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#99:1:A>
What do you think of that very brave shot by Chang <,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#100:1:D>
Oh <w> he's </w> good

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#101:1:A>
I thought that was a good shot

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#102:1:A>
He he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the
line edge <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#103:1:D>
He got a good tactic <,> good shot I mean he not the <,,>
these are the player <,,> sort of <,,> Ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted
to keep it down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#104:1:D>
In the beginning you try all those <,,> all such things

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#105:1:B>
I don't think he will try

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#106:1:D>
But that try that as this thirty all or <,,> so towards the
end of the <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#107:1:A>
May I <w> we'll </w> have to see whether it can be <,,> bad
attacking that bold as the games along but <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#108:1:B>
Fine <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#109:1:A>
The position at the moment is that India <,,> started serving
the match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#110:1:A>
The doubles match <,> first game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#111:1:A>
Leander Paes and Krishnan <,,> are representing India <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#112:1:A>
And Chang and Lee <,> are representing Korea in this very vital
doubles match this afternoon <,,> at the D L T A court <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#113:1:A>
India has won the first game

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#114:1:A>
Leander Paes held the service <,,> after winning the toss <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#115:1:A>
And now Chang <,,> serves to <,> Paes <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#116:1:E>
Chang of Korea to serve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#117:1:E>
Fifteen love <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#118:1:A>
Oh that was <,,> that was a necessarily pass <,,> somewhat in
touch was there <,,> have a look there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#119:1:A>
A nice return by Krishnan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#120:1:A>
Paes could have done anything with that in <,,> in the event he
<,,> steady infatuates put it wide outside the baseline <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#121:1:A>
A bit sure zoom for the <,,> rather <,,> unnecessary lapse <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#122:1:A>
They really dropped that return <,,> a good return

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#123:1:A>
Chang couldn't do anything there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#124:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> thirty fifteen to Korea <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#125:1:A>
Chang serving to Ramesh <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#126:1:E>
Forty fifteen

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#127:1:B>
Uh Ravi did you notice this time <,> when Chang was to serve
<,,> Lee the right hander non-playing hand <,> put it behind <,,> and held up
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#128:1:A>
Yes <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> a sort of <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#129:1:B>
You know signal

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#130:1:A>
A signal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#131:1:A>
A private signal system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#132:1:A>
A very pretty shot by Lee <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#133:1:A>
In fact that return very beautifully <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#134:1:A>
Make Tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#135:1:A>
In fact these are very difficult shots <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#136:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> one game all

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#137:1:A>
First two games had been held by the server <,,> Leander Paes won
his first game <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#138:1:A>
Chang <,,> gave in the same performance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#139:1:A>
One O first set <,,> in doubles tie <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#140:1:A>
Fifteen down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#141:1:A>
Now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#142:1:A>
I thought Lee want to get couldn't get it <,> slipped Chang ran
<,> almost got it but the net intercept <,> intercepted that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#143:1:A>
So <,,> Ramesh won the point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#144:1:A>
Already <,> tension is showing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#145:1:A>
And there goes another gushing out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#146:1:A>
Suman this is the fourth time <,,> in <O> laughs </O> since
yesterday

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#147:1:D>
As you have mentioned little while line called for <,> might
<}> <-> <.> wo wo wo </.> </-> <,> <=> uh would </=> </}> you see why Chang
miss that shot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#148:1:A>
Why ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#149:1:D>
The ball was low near the net

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#150:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#151:1:D>
And <,> both the Indians had covered up the <,> cross court

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#152:1:A>
Right <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#153:1:D>
So he thought of going down the line

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#154:1:A>
Going down the line

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#155:1:D>
But <,> but he can't run raise it <,> so near the net <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#156:1:A>
You can't you can't have these <,> totally inexplicable
errors while <,,> you <,> getting too tense <,> uh tense I think <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#157:1:A>
His serve stop by the net <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#158:1:A>
He anticipated that <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#159:1:D>
Rather good drive <,> rather good sense

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#160:1:D>
Have a look there <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#161:1:A>
Leander intercepts <,> Chang hits another nice shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#162:1:A>
Krishnan stretches and makes it into a win <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#163:1:A>
Oh another lovely shot by Krishnan there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#164:1:A>
A beautiful shot <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#165:1:B>
Good return and better volley <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#166:1:A>
An excellent return by Lee <,,> and even better volley by
Krishnan

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#167:1:A>
Look at that <,> good flak return by Lee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#168:1:A>
And <,,> Krishnan stretches out meets a nice big volley <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#169:1:A>
And he puts it into the net <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#170:1:A>
Krishnan there <,> serving <,> over game <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#171:1:E>
Game is over <,,> India leads two games to one <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#172:1:A>
Perfect <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#173:1:D>
But although India has led <,,> has won this game and leading
two games to one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#174:1:D>
I think we got to come back to those <,,> two point which uh <,,>
Leander Paes <,,> seems to have missed up very early in the <,> match

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#175:1:D>
He <,,> he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that
<,> very interesting smash

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#176:1:B>
<w> It's </w> improvising <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#177:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> <,> is it is it already the nerves catching up
with him <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#178:1:B>
No I think he is trying to prove himself that he <,,> he just
trying to overdo it which is <,> sometimes nerves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#179:1:B>
It won't be nerves he has played in this tournament <,>
particularly doubles before <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#180:1:B>
But here I think he is trying to <,,> prove a point and <,> trying
to finish off too soon <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#181:1:B>
Now both both the shots were <}> <-> <.> inex </.> <,> in </-> <=>
inexplicable </=> </}> those errors particularly second one when he got so
near the net <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#182:1:A>
What <,> and the point is that he has to cool down a little
bit because this is going to be a long game probably <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#183:1:A>
And uh <,> if you stretch on to <,> three or four hours of Tennis
<,> on a hot day like this you have to keep your cool <,,> more than anything
else I think

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#184:1:D>
<indig> Haan </indig> definitely I mean he <,> he can't
afford to make those those errors <,,> because uh <,> <}> <-> <.> af </.>
</-> <=> after </=> </}> a great an open you got a shot like this <,,> it is
a gift

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#185:1:A>
Yeah <,> and uh <,,> as Ramesh keeps the young lad in check
<,,> comment <,> by Suman and then to Rakesh Sharma <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#186:1:D>
Well I won't call <w> that's </w> a lead they are just
holding around because holding services <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-004#187:1:E>
Quite please <,> quite please <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-004#188:1:E>

Krishnan and Leander Paes <,,>
