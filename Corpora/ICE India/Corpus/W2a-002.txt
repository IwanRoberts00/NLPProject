All credit for showing the place of mind in the process of
acquiring knowledge goes to Kant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#5:1>
After Kant, it is Wittgenstein who takes a revolutionary position in
his approach to the theory of knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#6:1>
It is he who deserves recognition for showing the place of language in
acquiring and judging knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#7:1>
It may be said that Wittgenstein has replaced <w> Kant's </w> concept
of mind by language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#8:1>
The place of language in <w> Wittgenstein's </w> approach to
philosophy is as fundamental as the notion of mind in Kantian philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#9:1>
Moore is the first philosopher to give credibility to our intuitions
stemming from common sense and ordinary language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#10:1>
Though, Moore could make his impact on the method of philosophy, it
is Wittgenstein who is remembered most for showing the place of language in
doing philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#11:1>
Austin, Ryle, Strawson, Hare, Searle, Putnam, Donnellan, Kripke etc.,
to mention only a few from a very long list, are known for their
contributions to philosophy following the method of analyzing ordinary
language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#12:1>
There is no doubt that the ordinary language analysis coupled
with <w> one's </w> linguistic intuitions about terms and their uses is well
accepted as a valid method of doing philosophy today.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#13:1>
Ryle, for example, by adopting this method ordinary language
analysis, came to certain important conclusions about the human mind. <sp> 1
</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#14:1>
Speech act analysis has credibility mainly because the insights about
the working of ordinary language are used in developing this method. <sp> 2
</sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#15:1>
What is normally included under the title of <O> <&> page </&> 286
</O> <it> meta-ethics </it> is basically the analysis of value in ordinary
language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#16:1>
Hare, for example, extensively uses this method in developing theory
about moral language. <sp> 3 </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#17:1>
Individual philosophers, without making special efforts to
organize the insights about the working of language have used the ordinary
language analysis as a means to arrive at their own philosophical conclusions
paying hardly any attention to their powerful method of doing philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#18:1>
<quote> ` Pragmatics' </quote> is the name given to the study of
language from the perspective of <quote> ` language as a means' </quote> as a
part of semiology.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#19:1>
It is a growing field drawing literature from the field of
philosophy and linguistics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#20:1>
The studies of linguists of the pragmatic aspect of language,
often have been in the direction of understanding the mechanism of language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#21:1>
And some of them, perhaps, saw it as an alternative to Chomskian
model of understanding language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#22:1>
Philosophers have found pragmatics to be quite close to what they
have called <quote> ` ordinary language analysis' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#23:1>
They have often used isolated insights about the working of language
in solving philosophical riddles without paying much attention to many of the
underlying pragmatic principles of the language that they are using.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#24:1>
As they have primarily concerned themselves with the theories of
meaning, rules, and other related issues, they were forced to study
pragmatics of language incidentally without which they would not have found
it possible to explain, for example, what is <quote> ` meaning' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#25:1>
A fuller understanding of pragmatic aspects of the working of
language is yet to be achieved despite numerous attempts by philosophers and
linguists.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#26:1>
This paper aims to put a step towards that by highlighting certain
pragmetic principles, some of which may go otherwise unnoticed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#27:1>
The speakers of any natural language have to adhere to, among
other things, the pragmatic norms of the use of language, <O> <&> page </&>
287 </O> is quite obvious.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#28:1>
In any dynamic society, the activity of introducing new words,
modifying the uses of the existing ones in order to express thoughts more
rigourously or more precisely or in an unambiguous manner, introducing some
change in the uses of the words, or creative deviation from the normal uses
of words, etc., are inevitable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#29:1>
And all these activities are subsumed under the single heading
<quote> ` pragmatics' </quote> in this essay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#30:1>
Some of the pragmatic principles that we use to organise our
language are not so obvious because we have internalised them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#31:1>
Some of these principles that we shall discuss in this paper are as
follows : [ 1] the <it> Principle of Regularity in use </it> [ 2] the
Principle of the <it> Economy of vocabulary, </it> [ 3] the <it>
Elasticity or Rules, </it> [ 4] <it> Creative Users of Words, </it> and [ 5]
the Concept of <it> Enabling Institution </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#32:1>
It is not the case that only one pragmatic principle would be at work
at a given time; they may all work together to facilitate the use of
language. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#33:1>
<h> 1. <it> Regularity in Use </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#34:1>
Every user of language knows this principle, though one might not
be conscious of this.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#35:1>
Frequent deviations from the normal use of words cannot be
appreciated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#36:1>
Consider for the sake of argument the following example : a person
uses a natural language always with one deviation from the normal use of one
of the words that constitute his sentence.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#37:1>
This deviation is such that he does not repeat is pattern of
deviation every time he uses the same word in the same sentence; but would do
it differently whenever he uses the same sentence again.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#38:1>
Or he utters the same sentence second time, but this time he deviates
in the use of some other word.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#39:1>
Though the use of all the words except one, each time he utters a
sentence, is in accordance with the accepted rules of the language, one would
necessarily fail to understand his speech.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#40:1>
This is because one cannot mark the <O> <&> page </&> 288 </O>
deviation from the normal uses of words, as he deviates every time he utters
a sentence.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#41:1>
We do not make any beginning in understanding any of the sentences he
utters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#42:1>
Not even one sentence one could be sure of understanding when he
spoke.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#43:1>
Such deviations cannot be noted and taken into consideration while
interpreting his sentnece.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#44:1>
Only in conjunction with the sentences that have been understood, the
sentences that have not been understood can be put to certain
interpretations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#45:1>
And marking a deviation from the normal use of a word requires
certain new interpretation of rules for the use of the deviated word.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#46:1>
And this could be done only on the basis of the sentences that have
been understood.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#47:1>
On the other hand, one can perfectly understand what a person intends
to communicate even if he deviates from the normal uses of words provided
that his deviation of the term is consistent and regular.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#48:1>
Every time he uses the word, he should be using the word in the same
manner in which he has used it earlier.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#49:1>
This is how inquisitive parents understand their <w> child's </w>
language even though a <w> child's </w> language does not conform to the
rules of an adult language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#50:1>
Some children associate certain sounds with certain concepts in
their own peculiar manners.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#51:1>
This association is discovered by curious parents and communication
is made possible.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#52:1>
Deviation from the normal use of words is not an insurmountable
problem; philosophical literature is full of such cases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#53:1>
The most notorious words which are known for their irregular
behaviours in philosophy are <quote> ` knowledge', ` truth' </quote> and
<quote> ` real' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#54:1>
Every landmark in philosophy is marked by the use of these words in
certain deviant manners in the history of philosophy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#55:1>
Formal languages take the regularity and consistency in uses of
symbols or words for granted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#56:1>
It is not possible to define what is contradiction, for instance,
without assuming that the uses of words are regular and consistent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#57:1>
The principle of <&> page no. </&> <O> 289 </O> regularity in use, is
a bare minimum of rational and purposive use of language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#58:1>
One cannot hope to get any concessions from observing the strict
rule of regularity and consistency in the use of words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#59:1>
In order to evoke a certain type of response in a person, even the
poets who are known for their breaking of the conventional rules of language,
have to make a careful choice of words depending on the contexts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#60:1>
A <w> poet's </w> effort in hunting for the right word to invoke a
certain type of emotion in the reader shows that regularity in the use of
words is prior to <w> poet's </w> deviation in the use of those words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#61:1>
Poets make use of the fact that language is used in a systematic
and regular manner in formulating their sentences.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#62:1>
Without there being regularity and consistency in the use of words by
the people, poets would not have succeeded in invoking certain images in
their poetry using the method of deviation from the normal uses of words.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#63:1>
<h> 2. <it> Economy of Vocabulary </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#64:1>
If the principles of regularity and consistency in the use of
words apply to every word of a language, the principle of economy of
vocabulary applied only to a selective group of words or expressions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#65:1>
There are mainly two ways in which one practises the principle of
economy of vocabulary: [ a] <it> Economy of Words, </it> [ b] <it>
Formulations of Compound Words </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#66:1>
The philosophical position of Quine, namely, that there are no words
which are redundant in language is the other side of the principle of economy
of vocabulary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#67:1>
There are no two words with identical meanings in a language because
language is an efficiently evolved system - this is another way of stating
the same principle of economy of vocabulary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#68:1>
The main aim of the principle of economy of vocabulary is to avoid
duplication of words and their functions. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 290 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#69:1>
<h> [ a] <it> Economy of Words </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#70:1>
Even if one values clarity, one does not simply undertake a
project to introduce new words for each sense of the various terms which are
ambiguous.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#71:1>
Introducing a new word is the last option that one exercises when
everything else has failed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#72:1>
Imagine the number of words and the efforts on the part of the users
of language that is needed if one were to replace the word <quote> ` Mary'
</quote> by unique words in order to represent each individual called by this
name all over the world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#73:1>
If there is any confusion due to the multiplicity of reference of the
name <quote> ` Mary' </quote> , we simply provide an identyfying description
of the person along with the name in question in the context for the
identification. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#74:1>
One copes with the situation by simply distinguishing two or more
senses of term for a limited purpose, instead of introducing a new word
for every sense of a term burdening the rest of the speakers of the language
having to remember those words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#75:1>
Moreover, in the case of clear homonyms, one can use the terms
without ever stating different senses of them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#76:1>
For instance one is not put to any difficulty even if one does not
state explicitly the different senses of the term <quote> ` cricket'
</quote> while using this word.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#77:1>
A situation where one is likely to use this term as the name of an
insect would be quite different from the one where this term is used to refer
to a game.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#78:1>
This type of ambiguity does not create any serious practical problem
for the users of language.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#79:1>
Similarly, it serves no purpose to replace the term <quote> ` wicket'
</quote> by three distinct words to distinguish the three senses of the term,
namely, the batsman, the pitch and the stumps.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#80:1>
The term <quote> ` wicket' </quote> in the sentence <quote> `
England has only two wickets in hand now' </quote> can never be confused with
the pitch or stumps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#81:1>
Homonyms are wrongly thought to be linguistic accidents by some
philosophers. <sp> 4 </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#82:1>
There seems to be an optimum use of the <O> <&> page </&> 291 </O>
principle of economy of vocabulary underlying such linguistic accident.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#83:1>
For instance, one could clarify the two or more notions that are
associated with a term, or preferably coin new terms to use them as separate
words.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#84:1>
For instance, the term <quote> ` kite' </quote> as the name of a bird
could be easily distinguished from the plaything, and one could use two
separate words if one wants.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#85:1>
<quote> ` Kite' </quote> as the name of a natural kind which cannot
be confused with <quote> ` kite' </quote> which is a plaything.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#86:1>
One does not take the trouble to assign new and distinctive words to
different homonyms distinguishing their different senses, because one does
not encounter any practical difficulty because of homonyms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#87:1>
Even a homonym which denotes two or more complex notions could be
used without stating its different senses explicitly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#88:1>
For instance, the term <quote> ` house' </quote> when used in
different contexts denotes different complex notions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#89:1>
When used to refer to the place where humans inhabit, it means one
thing; and when used to refer to industrial complexes it means quite another.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#90:1>
Besides when the term is used to refer to a body of elected
representatives, as in the case of house of commons' it denotes yet
another thing.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#91:1>
But one does not find the necessity to coin separate words for these
different senses of the term in question for all practical purposes. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#92:1>
<h> [ b] <it> Formulations of Compound Words </it> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#93:1>
If having two or more senses attached to one word is one way of
economizing on the vocabulary, then forming compound words by using the words
in currency is another.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#94:1>
In general, when the situation becomes very complex due to the
expansion of knowledge or for other compelling reason, one normally
compounds the existing words or introduces new expressions to meet the
situation effectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#95:1>
The uses of the term <quote> ` bank' </quote> , for instance in a
variety of contexts, posed the difficulty of obscurity of <O> <&> page </&>
292 </O> meanings; and compound words were conveniently introduced like,
<quote> ` blood bank', ` question bank' </quote> etc., demarcating the
different uses of the term <quote> ` bank' </quote> to meet the situation
effectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#96:1>
This is what must have been the reason why the use of term <quote> `
war' </quote> is extended beyond recognition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#97:1>
We have invented the ways of coping with situation of referring to
different forms of wars using certain combination of the words which are in
currency.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#98:1>
We have now, <quote> ` world war', ` economic war', ` star war', `
civil war', ` cold war' </quote> etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#99:1>
We can even anticipate the possible situations where the need would
be felt to coin the compound words : <quote> ` communal war', ` sports war',
` cultural war' </quote> etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#100:1>
No doubt that man is an economic user of words in language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#101:1>
It is possible to compound words without burdening the
speakers of language, and such a method is preferred for the obvious
reason that it would help the speakers to keep their vocabulary within the
manageable number.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#102:1>
Surely, economy of vocabulary favourably affects the economical use
of human memory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#103:1>
There are yet other less consciously used methods used by the
members of a society which seem to be based on economic use of memory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#104:1>
This is no other method than adding new ceiteria for the uses of
words while modifying or completely discontinuing the existing ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-002#105:1>
Certain criteria would be shared between the parent term and the
newly formed compound word when we follow such a method.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#106:1>
To consider the example of <quote> ` war' </quote> again, it is with
the war spirit that we approve of economic sanctions against a country.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#107:1>
Nonetheless, one does not fight economic war with guns and bullets.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#108:1>
The specific criterion for identifying an economic war is
different from that of a military attack.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#109:1>
Non-cooperation may be the main thing that is shared between
<quote> ` economic war' </quote> and <quote> ` cold war' </quote> on the one
side, and <quote> ` war' </quote> on the other.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#110:1>
<quote> ` Civil wars' </quote> have non-cooperation as a common <O>
<&> page </&> 293 </O> criterion with <quote> ` economic war' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#111:1>
<quote> ` Star wars' </quote> have certain other criteria common to
military attacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-002#112:1>
All wars share some resemblances; they belong to a family. <sp> 6
</sp> </I>
