ABSTRACT <&> second margin begin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#5:1>
Heterosis, inbreeding depression and combining ability were
studied in a 6 x 6 diallel ( excluding reciprocals ) from F<sb>1</sb> to
F<sb>4</sb> generations for grain yield and its five components in sorghum (
<it> sorghum</it> bicolor ( L. ) Moench ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#6:1>
Among the different characters studied, highest heterosis in
F<sb>1</sb> over better parent ( 87. 5% ) was recorded for grain yield /
plant followed by number of grains / panicle ( 50.1 % ) and number of
primaries / panicle ( 40.5 % ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#7:1>
All the hybrids which showed higher estimates of heterosis in
F<sb>1</sb> in general also exhibited high inbreeding depression in
F<sb>2</sb> and other segregating generations studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#8:1>
The general ( gca ) as well as specific combining ability ( sca )
variances were found significant in all the four ( F<sb>1</sb>-F<sb>4</sb>)
generations for grain yield and its components studied except for number of
primaries / panicle in F<sb>3</sb> and F<sb>4</sb> and for number of
whorls/panicle in F<sb>2</sb> and F<sb>3</sb> generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#9:1>
The magnitude of sca variance declined in F<sb>2</sb> and latter
generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#10:1>
The predictability ratio showed preponderance of nonadditive genetic
variance for grain yield and additive genetic variance for 1000-grain weight
in sorghum.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#11:1>
The study of F<sb>1</sb> and F<sb>2</sb> would be sufficient to
assess repeatability of gca effects in advance generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#12:1>
Four cross combinations, viz SPV 451 x SPV 474, SPV 474 x IS 508, CSV
10 x SPV 451 and CSV 10 x SPV 474 were identified as promising, which can be
exploited to improve grain yield in sorghum. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#14:1>
Most of the studies on heterosis [ 1, 2 ] , inbreeding depression
[ 3 ] and combining ability analysis [ 4, 5 ] in sorghum are based on
F<sb>1</sb> and/or F<sb>2</sb> materials.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#15:1>
Few studies have been done simultaneously on F<sb>1</sb> and
F<sb>2</sb> generations [ 6, 7 ] highlighting the importance of obtaining
combining ability estimates over generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#16:1>
There is only one report on sorghum, where F<sb>1</sb>, F<sb>2</sb>
and F<sb>3</sb> in a 10 x 10 diallel mating system were studied
simultaneously [ 8].

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#17:1>
Studies on other autogamous crops have provided conflicting evidence
on repeatability of combining ability estimates over generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#18:1>
The present investigation has been, therefore, undertaken to study
heterosis in F<sb>1</sb> over the better parent ( BP ) , inbreeding depressin
over three ( F<sb>2</sb>,F<sb>3</sb> <O> <*> line from left to right</*>

ability ( gca, sca ) from F<sb>1</sb> to F<sb>4</sb> generations for grain
yield and its component characters in sorghum. </p> <&> centered </&>

<h> MATERIALS AND METHODS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#21:1>
The parental material involved five exotic x Indian derivatives (
SU 104, CSV 10, CSV 11, SPV 451 and SPV 474 ) and a collection from World
Germplasm ( IS 508 ) , Diallel crosses ( excluding reciprocals ) were
effected with these six varieties.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#22:1>
The parents and F<sb>1</sb>-F<sb>4</sb> generations of the crosses
were sown in a randomized block design with three replications at the
research farm of the Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Udaipur.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#23:1>
The plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances were 15 cm and 45 cm,
respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#24:1>
Individual plots of parents and F<sb>1</sb>s consisting of single 3 m
long row, while F<sb>2</sb>, F<sb>3</sb> and F4 bulks of each cross in 3-row
plots were planted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#25:1>
Data on ten random plants in parents and F<sb>1</sb>s, and 30 plants
in F<sb>2</sb>, F<sb>3</sb> and F<sb>4</sb> bulks were recorded for grain
yield/plant and its five component characters, viz. 1000-grain weight,
grains/panicle, primaries/panicle, whorls/panicle, and panicle length.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#26:1>
Plot means were used for statistical analysis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#27:1>
Heterosis over better parent ( BP) and inbreeding depression in
F<sb>2</sb>, F<sb>3</sb> and F<sb>4</sb> generations over their preceding
generations were calculated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#28:1>
The combining ability effects and variances were estimated separately
for four ( F<sb>1</sb>-F<sb>4</sb>) generations according to Model 1 and
Method 2 of Griffing [ 9 ] .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#29:1>
The general predictability ratio was calculated as suggested by Baker
[ 10 ] . </p> <&> centered </&>

<h> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#31:1>
<h> HETEROSIS AND INBREEDING DEPRESSION </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#32:1>
Among the different characters studied, the extent of positive
heterosis over the better parent was highest for grain yield / plant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#33:1>
Heterosis for grain yield ranged from 7.7 to 87.5 %, the mean being
43.9 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#34:1>
Maximum heterosis was recorded in the cross SPV 451 x SPV 474 ( 87.5
% ) closely followed by SPV 474 x IS 508 ( 66.2 % ) and CSV 10 x IS 508 (
64.5 % ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#35:1>
These hybrids were also superior in per se performance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#36:1>
The findings of the present investigation on the magnitude of
heterosis for grain yield are consistent with the earlier reports [ 11-13 ]
in sorghum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#37:1>
Grain yield is the final product, its expression depends on the
contribution of component characters and the extent of their mutual
cancellation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#38:1>
The present study revealed that hybrids which exhibited heterosis for
grain yield were not heterotic for all the characters studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#39:1>
Among the direct components, number of grains / panicle was
important.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#40:1>
The range of heterosis for this trait was from - 5.7 to 50.1 %, the
mean being 25.8 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#41:1>
Second, twelve of the thirteen heterotic hybrids for grain yield also
depicted heterosis for this trait.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#42:1>
Nandanwankar et al. [ 2] and Vashi et al. [ 14 ] also reported that
number of grains / panicle was the major contributor to heterosis for grain
yield in sorghum.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#43:1>
Among <O> <&> page </&> 140 </O> the remaining components,
primaries/panicle exhibited maximum heterosis ( 40.5 % ) , followed by whorls
/ panicle ( 30.4 % ) , panicle length ( 25.4 % ) and 1000-grain weight ( 18.6
% ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#44:1>
Patel et al. [ 1 ] also observed significant heterosis for these
attributes in sorghum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#45:1>
One of the characteristics of heterosis is that the increased
vigour is confined to F<sb>1</sb> generation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#46:1>
There is a considerable depression from F<sb>1</sb> to F<sb>2</sb>
and later generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#47:1>
It may be seen from the present results that hybrid combinations
which showed higher estimates of heterosis, in general, also exhibited high
inbreeding depression in one or other segregating generations studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#48:1>
In the present study, nine out of thirteen heterotic hybrids for
grain yield exhibited significant inbreeding depression in F<sb>2</sb> as
well as in F<sb>3</sb> generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#49:1>
The magnitude of inbreeding depression varied from 3.5 to 36.3 % in
F<sb>2</sb> and from 12.0 to 28.1 % in F<sb>3</sb> generation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#50:1>
Similar variations in the magnitude of inbreeding depression for
grain yield of sorghum has also been recorded by Kulkarni et al. [ 3 ] and
Goyal and Joshi [ 4 ] in F<sb>1</sb> to F<sb>2</sb> and F<sb>3</sb>
generations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#51:1>
Variations in inbreeding depression in component characters from
F<sb>1</sb> to F<sb>2</sb> and onwards revealed complexities in the
inheritance of grain yield in sorghum.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#52:1>
Among the different component traits, number of grains / panicle
showed maximum inbreeding depression in F<sb>2</sb> ( 31.0 % ) as well as in
F<sb>3</sb> ( 26.1 % ) generation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#53:1>
As regards 1000- grain weight, not only all the heterotic crosses
showed significant depression, the test weight of the five nonheterotic
crosses also declined significantly in F<sb>2</sb> or F<sb>3</sb>
generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#54:1>
Almost all the heterotic crosses for number of whorls / panicle and
panicle length depicted significant inbreeding depression in F<sb>2</sb> or
in one of the later segregating generations. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#55:1>
<h> COMBINING ABILITY ANALYSIS </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#56:1>
The general as well as specific combining ability ( gca, sca )
variances ( Table 1 ) were significant in all the four (
F<sb>1</sb>-F<sb>4</sb> ) generations for grain yield and its component
characters, except for number of primaries / panicle in F<sb>3</sb> and
F<sb>4</sb> and for number of whorls / panicle in F<sb>2</sb> and F<sb>3</sb>
generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#57:1>
In self-fertilizing crops, heterozygosity is expected to decline in
the advanced generations and ultimately specific combining ability variance
should be nonsignificant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#58:1>
In the present study, though the magnitude of sca variance declined
in F<sb>2</sb> and later generations for grain yield as well as other
attributes, it still remained significant for most of the characters in all
the generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#59:1>
Significant contribution of sca variance in advance generations could
be due to additive x additive interaction component.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#60:1>
Another reason could be dissipation of linkages inflating the
estimates and their likelihood of being in a more balanced phase.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#61:1>
Bhullar et al. [ 15] explained significant contribution of sca
variance in the advanced generations in wheat on the basis of evolutionary
divergence among the progenies of the same parental arrey, each progeny bulk
having different interaction system and on the presumption of high additive x
additive interaction. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 141 </O> <O> Table 1. </O> <O>

</O> <O> caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#63:1>
The predictability ratio indicated the importance of nonadditive
genetic variance for grain yield and additive genetic variance for 1000-grain
weight over generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#64:1>
However, for the remaining characters preponderance of nonadditive
genetic variance in F<sb>1</sb> and additive genetic variance in the
segregating generations was observed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#65:1>
Similar results were reported by Goud et al. [ 16 ] and Singhania [
17 ] for grain yield and Desai et al. [ 5 ] for 1000-grain weight from
F<sb>1</sb> material.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#66:1>
On the other hand, Niehaus and Pickett [ 6 ] and Govil and Murty [ 7 ]
from F<sb>1</sb> and F<sb>2</sb> and Govil et al. [ 8 ] from simultaneous
study of F<sb>1</sb>, F<sb>2</sb> and F<sb>3</sb> generation material
reported importance of both additive and nonadditive components of genetic
variance in the inheritance of grain yield. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#67:1>
The magnitude and direction of combining ability effects provide
guidelines for discriminating parents and their utilization.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#68:1>
In the present study, significant gca effects have been recorded for
all the characters studied ( Table 2 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#69:1>
However, none of the parents studied was a good combiner for all the
attributes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#70:1>
In other words, the optimum level of different <O> <&> page </&> 142
</O> <O> Table 2. </O> <O> caption </O> attributes was not present in any of
the parents used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#71:1>
The best parent identified was CSV 10, which was a good combiner for
grain yield and 1000- grain weight.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#72:1>
Nandanwankar et al. [ 12 ] also found CSV 10 ( SPV 346 ) as a god
combiner for grain yield. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#73:1>
Another parent, SPV 474, combined well for grain yield, number of
grains and number of primaries, but it was a poor combiner for 1000-grain
weight.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#74:1>
Among the other parents, IS 508 was a good combiner for 1000-grain
weight, number of primaries and panicle length, and CSV 11 for number of
grains, number of whorls and panicle length.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#75:1>
While parents, SU 104 and SPV 451 were poor combiners for most of the
attributes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#76:1>
Looking to generally similar magnitude and direction of gca effects
over generations, it could be concluded that the estimates from F<sb>1</sb>
and F<sb>2</sb> generations would be sufficient to assess their repeatability
in <O> <&> page </&> 143 </O> advance generations, reliability of F<sb>2</sb>
estimates being marginally better.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#77:1>
Similar observations were also made by Bhullar et al. [ 15 ] in
wheat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#78:1>
The magnitude of sca effects is of vital importance in selecting
cross combinations with higher probability of generating desired
transgressive segregates, particularly when the estimates are available over
generations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#79:1>
The repeatability of sca effects of grain yield over generations was
much less than for gca effects.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#80:1>
This may be due to gradual reduction in the heterotic effects for
grain yield from F<sb>2</sb> onwards.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#81:1>
Out of the nine crosses, which exhibited significant and positive sca
effects in F<sb>1</sb>, only in three crosses ( SU 104 x CSV 11, SU 104 x SPV
451 and SPV 451 x SPV 474 ) the effects were found to be significantly
positive in all the generations studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#82:1>
The dissipation of sca effects in the other crosses was variable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#83:1>
The inheritance of grain yield thus appears more complex in
comparison to its direct components.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#84:1>
The estimates of gca and sca effects in different crosses over
generations indicated importance of additive, dominance as well as
interaction effects in the inheritance of grain yield in sorghum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#85:1>
Out of the eleven crosses with significantly positive sca effects
for number of grains/panicle in the F<sb>1</sb>, only two crosses ( SU 104 x
CSV 10 and SU 104 x SPV 451 ) exhibited similar magnitude of sca effects in
all the segregating generations studied.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#86:1>
Interestingly, in a good number of crosses, the sca effects were of
similar magnitude over generations for test weight.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#87:1>
Among the eight crosses, which depicted significant and positive sca
effects in F<sb>1</sb> set, the crosses SU 104 x CSV 10, SU 104 x CSV 11, CSV
10 x IS 508, SPV 451 x SPV 474 and SPV 474 x IS 508 exhibited similar values
over generations and in the cross SPV 451 x IS 508 in all generations except
in F<sb>1</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#88:1>
Higher values of gca variance in comparison to sca variance and
similar magnitude to sca effects over generations revealed the important role
of additive and additive x additive type of interaction in the inheritance of
test weight.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#89:1>
As regards number of primaries/panicle, of the four crosses, viz SU
104 x IS 508, CSV 10 x SPV 451, CSV 10 x IS 508 and SPV 474 x IS 508 which
depicted significant and positive sca effects in F<sb>1</sb>, the same
effects were also present in F<sb>2</sb> set in the first two crosses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#90:1>
The ANOVA for combining ability ( Table 1 ) revealed
nonsignificant sca variance for number of whorls / panicle in the F<sb>2</sb>
and F<sb>3</sb> diallel set.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#91:1>
Out of the fifteen crosses studied, five crosses depicted significant
and positive sca effects for number of whorls in F<sb>1</sb> diallel set and
only one cross ( CSV 10 x CSV 11 ) in F<sb>4</sb> generation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#92:1>
The nonsignificant estimates of sca effects in the segregating
generations revealed preponderance of additive gene effects in the
inheritance of this trait.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#93:1>
As regards panicle length, out of the six crosses showing positive
sca effects in F<sb>1</sb>, significant positive sca effects in all other
generations were recorded in only one cross, CSV 11 x SPV 474.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#94:1>
The estimates of sca effects in the segregating generations revealed
complexities in the inheritance of panicle length.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#95:1>
In majority of crosses, for which sca effects were nonsignificant in
the F<sb>1</sb> diallel set, the effects were significant in the segregating
generations. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 144 </O> <O> Table 3.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-023#97:1>
On the basis of present findings ( Table 3 ) , four cross
combinations, viz. SPV 451 x SPV 474, SPV 474 x IS 508, CSV 10 x SPV 451 and
CSV 10 x SPV 474, showed high BP heterosis, significant sca effects over
generations, and also involved parents in the high gca for grain yield and
some of its components.

<ICE-IND:W2A-023#98:1>
Such crosses should be exploited to develop strains with good grain
yield in sorghum. </p> </I>
