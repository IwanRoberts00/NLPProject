<h> Need to review bonanza for Lalit Suri </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#4:1>
In the capital, there is one identifiable monument to the
rapine of financial institutions and banks.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#5:1>
This edifice was initially the product of illegal largesse, and then
has been constructed brick by brick by public funds wantonly granted - - an
example of how the heads of financial institutions and one bank have
flouted banking norms and pumped in good money after bad to shore up the
financially diseased structure.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#6:1>
This monolith is Lalit <quote> 'Sumitomo' </quote> Suri's Holiday Inn
hotel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#7:1>
Mr. Suri, when he decided to go into the hotel business, roped in
three financial institutions and one bank to help finance his fantasy.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#8:1>
They were S.S. Nadkarni's Industrial Development Bank of India (
IFBI), N. Vaghul's Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (
ICICI) and D.N. Davar's Industrial Finance Corporation of India ( IPCI) and
Premjit Singh's Bank of Baroda ( BoB).

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#9:1>
Together, these institutions have advanced over Rs. 40 <indig> crores
</indig> worth of finances, on flimsy and doubtful security and even after
the borrower's inability or intransigency in <}> <-> repayng </-> <+>
repaying </+> </}> earlier instalments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#10:1>
This huge sum has been advanced in a period of little more than
three years to Suri's Bharat Hotels which has built the Holiday Inn.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#11:1>
Today, there is a real apprehension, with losses accumulating to Rs.
11.09 <indig> crore </indig> <}> <-> upto </-> <+> up to </+> </}> March 31,
1989, that the loans advanced are in jeopardy.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#12:1>
There has been an official recommendation by the Public Accounts
Committee ( PAC) of Parliament that the hotel be taken over and publicly
auctioned for breach of contract.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#13:1>
If that happens, all that the institutions will be left with, will be
forks and spoons, pots and pans, cots and mattresses and airconditioners and
lifts.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#14:1>
For all these loans have been advanced, for the most part, against
the movable property of the hotel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#15:1>
The break-up of the financing provided by the institutions and
Bank of Baroda is as follows:- </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#16:1>
- - On November 1, 1985, Rs. 8 <indig> crores </indig> is handed
over to Bharat Hotels by a consortium of the three institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#17:1>
Of this, the share of IDBI is Rs. 4 <indig> crore </indig> , ICPI Rs.
2 <indig> crore </indig> , and ICICI Rs. 2 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#18:1>
Simultaneously, the agreement provides for a Euro-Dollar loan of
US

$7,630,742 ( Rs. 11.93 <indig> crores </indig> as per the balance sheet)
advanced by four banks: Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of
India, and Indian Overseas Bank.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#19:1>
The sums advanced are: Bank of Baroda US

$3,582,215.22, Syndicate US

$2,352,805.04, Central US

$847,859.37, Indian Overseas, US

$847,859.37. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#20:1>
The mortgage is, in this instance, in respect of all movable
immovable properties.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#21:1>
This is the only time that immovable property has been charged.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#22:1>
Why this was not included in subsequent mortgages is explained later.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#23:1>
The latest balance sheet shows only Bank of Baroda's
outstandings.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#24:1>
Obviously, the bank has transferred the amounts advanced by the
consortium to itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#25:1>
- - On May 15, 1986, within six months of Rs. 21 <indig> crore
</indig> being handed over, IFCI sanctioned a term loan of Rs. 3.5 <indig>
crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#26:1>
This is under the Project Finance Participation Scheme ( PFPS).

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#27:1>
The mortgage is now only on movable property and the short
particulars of this head are repeated verbatim in all subsequent agreements.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#28:1>
- - On March 3, 1987, IFCI and IDBI provide for another Rs. one
<indig> crore </indig> in equal proportions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#29:1>
The mortgage comprises only movable property. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#30:1>
- - On June 8, 1988, the three financial institutions again
seek to bail out Suri.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#31:1>
This time they rush with Rs. 10.38 <indig> crore </indig> approx. as
term loans.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#32:1>
The break-up this time is, IDBI Rs. 5,28,35,000, ICICI Rs.
2,44,00,000 and IFCI Rs. 2,65,06,000.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#33:1>
The mortgage, needless to add, is pots and pans, cots and carpets.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#34:1>
- - On March 3, 1989, responding to a further SOS from Suri, as
in their own words the borrower is in need of further funds: the trio of
financial institutions provide succour to the tune of another Rs. 4 <indig>
crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#35:1>
The lenders themselves have divided this in the ratio of IDBI Rs. 2
<indig> crores </indig> and the other two Rs. one <indig> crore </indig>
each.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#36:1>
The mortgaged items are the same. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#37:1>
In addition to these amounts, the balance sheet of the company
shows a Rs. one <indig> crore </indig> rupee term loan extended by Bank of
Baroda and a cash credit facility of Rs. 1.15 <indig> crore </indig> with
Canara Bank <}> <-> agaInst </-> <+> against </+> </}> hypothecation of
stocks, stores, supplies and book debts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#38:1>
The items offered as security, reproduced with almost
cyclostyled monotony in all the agreements, read thus:- </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#39:1>
<X> <quote> " The whole of the movable properties of the
Borrower, ( Bharat Hotels) including its movable plant and machinery,
machinery spares, tools and accessories, fixtures and fittings, electrical
installations, furnitures, cutleries, crockeries, utensils, vessels,
mattresses, carpets, cots, tables, cars, trucks, jeeps, buses, vehicles,
trollies, calculating machines, refrigerators, air-conditioners, coolers,
modern electrical/ electronic and other appliances, computers, etc. and other
movables, both present and future ( save and except book debts) whether
installed or not and whether now lying loose or in cases or which are now
lying or stores in or about or shall hereafter from time to time during the
continuance of the security of these presents be brought into or upon or
be stored or be in or about all the Borrower's hotel, premises and godowns
wherever the same may be or be held by any part to the order or disposition
of the borrower, or in the course of transit or on high seas or on order, or
delivery howsoever and wheresoever in the possession of the borrower and
either by way of addition or substitution." </quote> </X> </p>

<h> Need to review bonanza for Lalit Suri </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#42:1>
<bold> Continued from page 1 </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#43:1>
This outflow of public finance into the apparently bottomless pit
of Bharat Hotels would never have been sanctioned on an independent appraisal
of merit for the following reasons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#44:1>
The hotel itself was conceived of an illegality.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#45:1>
The land on which the Holiday Inn was built was leased by the Finance
Ministry to the New Delhi <}> <-> Mmicipal </-> <+> Municipal </+> </}>
Corporation ( NDMC) with the specific condition that no sub-lease be created
or the land handed over to any private party for development.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#46:1>
This was, of course, abrogated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#47:1>
The agreement with NDMC, however, stipulated that the land and
any structure on it could not be sold, disposed of or even mortgaged.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#48:1>
As Suri could not pledge immovable property, the NDMC agreement was
supplemented with two memoranda which allowed the hotel to mortgage
structures on it but not the land.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#49:1>
This was all unearthed by the outgoing PAC chaired by Amal Datta.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#50:1>
However, it is a clear legal postulate that no structure can
be mortgaged in isolation of the land it is situated on.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#51:1>
The PAC's draft report is extremely illuminating on this score: <X>
<quote> " The Committee has asked for the papers relating to the
transactions so as to enable it to obtain the opinion of the
Attorney-General as to whether it is legally permissible to create a mortgage
in such a fashion <*> dotted-line</*> we are practically convinced that it is
not permissible.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#X52:1>
However, the financial institutions required repeated prodding to
bring before the Committee the very scanty information and ultimately did
to make sure it was too late to be able to take a legal opinion of the
Attorney-General.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#X53:1>
They gave the impression that they were reluctant to have the
matter probed or the legality scrutinised." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#54:1>
This was possibly the reason why after the initial sanction of
Rs. 8 <indig> crores </indig> by the three FIs for both movable and immovable
property, the rest of the term loans were all secured by only movable
property. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#55:1>
The Company has been unable to honour its commitments on its
repayment schedule and the payments on some of its loans had to be
rescheduled.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#56:1>
The 1988-89 balance sheet of Bharat Hotels shows only the interest
accrued and due on term loans as Rs. 5.03 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#57:1>
It must also be born in mind that the company enjoyed a substantial
holiday before the instalments on its loans became due.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#58:1>
For example, the first instalment on a term loan sanctioned by
IFCI of Rs. 3.5 <indig> crore </indig> , with the charge created on May
15,1986, was due only on May 15,1988, to be paid in six monthly instalments
right <}> <-> upto </-> <+> up to </+> </}> May 15, 1995. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#59:1>
In the instance of the Bank of Baroda's euro-dollar loans
provided by BOB's London branch, the situation is so piquant, it is almost
a double blow.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#60:1>
According to the stringent requirements of the Bank of England,
the monitoring body in the UK, any loan on which there is a default of two
consecutive payments is classified as non-performing.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#61:1>
This is immediately reported by vigilant auditors and the bank has to
make a provision out of profits for the entire amount of the loan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#62:1>
Today, the bank has not recovered even the interest on its loans.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#63:1>
It has had to take special permission of the Reserve Bank under
Section 16 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act ( FERA) and is remitting
the interest component from its own funds to its branch in London.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#64:1>
If the bank wants to avoid any adverse reaction from Bank of England,
it will have to remit US

$ 1.977 million ( Rs. 3.3 <indig> crore </indig> ) to date.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#65:1>
A large amount has already been remitted on this account. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#66:1>
In fact, an internal note of BOB states that the party has failed
to remit interest on the euro-dollar loan deposit despite several reminders.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#67:1>
The documents are not executed properly and guarantee fees have not
been paid for the past two years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#68:1>
It is also learnt that <}> <-> inspite </-> <+> in spite </+> </}> of
the account classified as sick, a sum of Rs. 2 <indig> crore </indig> has
been advanced against the shopping complex.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#69:1>
Legal action is now being contemplated to recover the outstanding.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#70:1>
The tangible security offered against these loans is extremely
inadequate to cover the Rs. 45 <indig> crore </indig> plus dues of the
company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#71:1>
On January 1, 1988, when the banks and FIs has already advanced
Rs. 25.5 <indig> crore </indig> to the company, the balance sheet showed the
written down value of the plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures and
vehicles at Rs. 16.58 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#72:1>
At the end of March 1989, the written down value had doubled to Rs.
43.5 <indig> crore </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#73:1>
However, considering the nature of plant and machinery, comprising
mainly airconditioning plants and lifts which have no manufacturing output,
the maximum that can be advanced by banks is about 60-65 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#74:1>
Thus, the FIs and banks, had they followed norms, could not have
advanced more than around Rs. 30 <indig> crore </indig> towards the project.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#75:1>
Further, the company exhibits an extremely poor <}> <->
debte-quity </-> <+> debt-equity </+> </}> ratio of 25:1.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#76:1>
This is against 2:1 for a healthy company.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#77:1>
While the debt of Bharat Hotels amounts to Rs. 79.54 <indig> crore
</indig> ( loan funds of Rs. 47.60 <indig> crore </indig> plus deposits for
sub-licence fee on the shopping centre of Rs. 31.94 <indig> crore </indig> )
the equity amounts to only Rs. 3.23 <indig> crore </indig> ( shareholder's
funds and reserves totalling Rs. 14.33 <indig> crores </indig> minus
carried forward losses of Rs. 11.09 <indig> crore </indig> ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#78:1>
In the present circumstances of increasing debts, rising losses
and uncertainty over the title of land, the company presents a very poor
investment for FIs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#79:1>
While the motivation for the financial <w> institutions' </w>
infusion of funds needs to be probed, in order to protect their investment
they would be left with little recourse but to exercise their option to
convert, as stipulated in their agreements, 20 per cent of the loan amounts
aggregating Rs. 26.87 <indig> crore </indig> into fully paid equity shares
and assume control of the company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-015#80:1>
The financial affairs of Bharat Hotels is symptomatic foremost of
the arbitrary functioning of financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-015#81:1>
The government needs to send clear signals that the heads of FIs are
to strictly function within parameters and not seek to appease political
bosses to nurture prospects of personal advancement. </p> </I>
