<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#1:1:A>
Now today <,,> we are going to start the new topic <,>
<mention> The laws of return <,,> laws of <,> return </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#2:1:A>
Now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#3:1:A>
There you have studied regarding the behaviour of a <,> consumer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#4:1:A>
How a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#5:1:A>
You have studied that <,> when the price increases <,> the quantity
demanded <,,> decreases and when price fall the quantity demand is <,>
increased <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#6:1:A>
Now here <,,> you have studied the behaviour of a consumer <,> that
how the consumer always tries to maximise his satis<,>faction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#7:1:A>
Now under the laws of return <,> we are going to study the behaviour
of a <,> producer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#8:1:A>
That how the producer <,> is trying to find out the relationship
between the input and output <,> and how this input-output relationship is
<,> useful <,,> for <,,> determining his cost of production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#9:1:A>
Because his returns depends upon <,> the cost of production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#10:1:A>
So under this now <mention> laws of return </mention> we have to
study <,> three different types of laws <,> <mention> the law of increasing
return diminishing return constant return </mention> <,> and we have also to
study the returns to state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#11:1:A>
But before we start <,> with the <mention> law of increasing return
</mention> or <mention> law of variable proportion </mention> <,> we have to
be very clear regarding these certain <,> concepts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#12:1:A>
So the first concept regarding which <,,> we have to be clear that
is the production function <,> production function <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#13:1:A>
Production function <,> now you can write on this production
function <,> <&> Begins to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#14:1:A>
According to Professor Lepski <,,> <quote> Production function is
<,,> production function is <,,> a technological relation <,,> is <,,> a
technological relation <,,> showing for given state of technology <,,>
showing for given state of technology <,,> <&> cough </&> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#15:1:A>
This explains <,> <&> cough </&> <,,> how much can be produced <,,>
how much can be produced <,,> with <,,> given amount of input <,,> with <,,>
given amount of <,> input <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#16:1:A>
<quote> The functional relationship <,,> the functional
relationship <,,> with the <,,> physical input <,,> and physical output <,,>
is known as production function <,,> is <,,> known as <,,> production
function </quote> <,,> <&> ends to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#17:1:A>
It can be written in the form of equation <,,> it can be written in
the form of equation <,,> as <,,> <mention> Quantity <,,> is equal to F <,,>
A B <,> C <,> D <,,> quantity equal to F <,> A B C D </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#18:1:A>
Here <,,> quantity <,> <&> B B work begin </&> Q means quantity
<,,> F <,,> means factors of <,> production <,,> A B C D <&> B B work end
</&> different factors of production <,,> A B C D different factors of <,>
production <,,> <&> Begins to dictates </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#19:1:A>
This equation shows <,,> <&> cough </&> this equation shows <,,>
quantity produced <,,> depends on <,,> factors <,,> of production <,>
respectively <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#20:1:A>
This <,> equation shows <,> quantity produced <,> depends on <,,>
factors <,,> of production respectively <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#21:1:A>
Production function <,,> production function <,,> expresses the
relationship <,,> production function expresses <,,> the relationship <,,>
between <,,> quantity of output <,,> quantity of output <,,> and quantities
of various inputs <,,> and quantities of various inputs <,,> <&> ends to
dictate </&> written

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#22:1:A>
Now in this <,,> production function what do you come to know <,>
that what is production function <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#23:1:A>
It is a type of technological relationship <,> which is existing
between the input and output

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#24:1:A>
Now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the
meaning of output <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#25:1:A>
What is the meaning of input <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#26:1:A>
Yes <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#27:1:A>
Yes answer me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#28:1:A>
<w> It's </w> alright <w> it's </w> a new topic but you must come
forward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#29:1:A>
Now for the production of commodity what do you need <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#30:1:S>
Raw materials

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#31:1:A>
Raw materials so all these raw materials are input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#32:1:A>
This factors of production <,> as land labour capital raw materials
all these are the input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#33:1:A>
Now there supposingly <,> there are two labourers and they are
producing ten chairs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#34:1:A>
Now what is the relationship between this <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#35:1:A>
Raw material also they are using

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#36:1:A>
Along with that now what you will say <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#37:1:A>
That making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce
the ten chairs in a day

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#38:1:A>
So this is the production function that when we employ the two
labourers <,> they are producing <,> ten chairs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#39:1:A>
When we employ the third labourer the production function will <,>
change because they will be producing now <,> more number of chairs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#40:1:A>
So what is production function ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#41:1:A>
It is simply <,> a relationship between <,> the inputs and outputs
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#42:1:A>
Input is here the factors of production <,> or the amount of the
goods which we are using for the production of other commodities <,> and
output is the commodity which you are able to produce <,> after making use of
the input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#43:1:A>
And production function is giving you the relationship between the
input and output <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#44:1:A>
Thereby having this much of factors of production how much
commodity we can <,> produce

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#45:1:A>
So to that we are calling it as a <,> input and output relationship
<,> <&> Begins to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#46:1:A>
Then further <,,> two things must be noted <,,> two things must be
noted <,,> in respect of <,,> in respect of <,,> production function <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#47:1:A>
First <,,> production <,,> must be <,,> considered <,,> with
reference to a particular period of time <,,> production must be considered
<,> with reference to <,,> particular period of time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#48:1:A>
Written <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#49:1:A>
Second <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#50:1:A>
Production technology should not <,> change <,,> production
technology <,> should not change <,> during that period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#51:1:A>
Production technology <,,> should not change <,,> during <,> that
period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#52:1:A>
Because <,> when technology changes <,,> because <,> when
technology changes <,,> production function also gets <,,> changed <,,> when
technology changes <,,> production function <,> also gets changed <,,> <&>
ends to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#53:1:A>
Now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind
regarding the <,> production function <,> that it should be related to a
particular period of time and during that period <,> our technology should
not be changed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#54:1:A>
Because if the technology will change <,> then our same production
function relationship will not <,> be there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#55:1:A>
Why ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#56:1:A>
Because with technology advancement when the technology changes <,>
new input output relation come <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#57:1:A>
So then our that production function cannot exist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#58:1:A>
So when we are studying it <,> for a particular period of time
during that period it is essential <,> that the technology should not change

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#59:1:A>
As accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help
of handloom device <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#60:1:A>
Now production was less <,,> and after <-> that </-> some period
new technology has come <,> and now we may start producing the <,> cloth with
the help of <,> powerloom you can say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#61:1:A>
So naturally input output relation will <,> change <,> and
production function will also change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#62:1:A>
Then <,,> <&> Begins to dictate </&> in economic theory <,,> two
types of production function are there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#63:1:A>
In economic theory <,,> two types of production function are there
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#64:1:A>
First <,,> when <,,> some input <,,> when <,> some input <,> are
kept constant <,,> when some input are kept constant <,,> and other is
changed <,,> and other are changed <,,> <&> ends to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#65:1:A>
Written <,> now this type of <,> production function will be
available in the short period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#66:1:A>
Now I had explained to you already the concept of short period <,>
market period and long period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#67:1:A>
From the adjustment of the supply point of view <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#68:1:A>
Now can you tell me now what is short period <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#69:1:A>
Now again you have to go back

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#70:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very bad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#71:1:A>
What is short period <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#72:1:S>
During the short period the supply can be <,> input to the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#73:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#74:1:A>
Short periods are that period in which <,> we can <}> <-> <.> ad
</.> </-> <=> adjust </=> </}> the supply to a limited absence <,> only by
taking the variable factors of production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#75:1:A>
I told you there are two types of factors of production <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#76:1:A>
Fixed factors of production and <,> variable factors of production

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#77:1:A>
So in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as <-> a
</-> <,> unchanged

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#78:1:A>
Because <-> now </-> just now you have written <,> that in this
production function <,> some inputs are kept constant and others are changed
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#79:1:A>
Here fixed factors are kept constant <,> and variable factors are
changed during the short period <,> and supply is at the dip <,> at your
limited extent

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#80:1:A>
And in the short period <,> then a little laws of returns are
applicable as the law of increasing return <,> diminishing return and
constant returns

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#81:1:A>
These laws will be applicable in the short period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#82:1:A>
Why ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#83:1:A>
Because in the short period <,> you are not taking the fixed factor
we are simply taking the <,> variable factor

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#84:1:A>
And when you are taking the variable factor <,> in the beginning
<,> then the returns starts increasing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#85:1:A>
Why they start increasing because <,> earlier you are not making
proper utilisation of the fixed factors of <,> production

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#86:1:A>
Now you want to increase the production and by employing the
variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed
factors of <,> production <,> because of this your return have started
increasing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#87:1:A>
But after some time your result return will start <,> diminishing

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#88:1:A>
Now why they will start diminishing <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#89:1:A>
Why ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#90:1:A>
Because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable
factors on that thing <,> your variable factors are becoming more in
proportion to the fixed factors and <,> they are getting lesser and lesser
shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this <,> their
return starts diminishing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#91:1:A>
So you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of
production function <,> is applicable in the short period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#92:1:A>
Now second is <,> there all the inputs can be changed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#93:1:A>
All the factors are changed <,,> all the factors are changed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#94:1:A>
So this is the <,> second production function and it is applicable
in the <,> long run

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#95:1:A>
Because long period you know is that period <,> where all type of
adjustments are possible <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#96:1:A>
Supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the
factors of production becomes <,> variable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#97:1:A>
And under this production function you will be selling the returns
to state <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#98:1:A>
Uh became one of the <}> <-> <.> diff diff </.> </-> <=> difference
</=> </}> coming between them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#99:1:A>
There in the short period <,> laws of return

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#100:1:A>
Here returns to <,> state because in the second production
function <,> you are totaly changing the scale of the production <,> and
because of the change in the scale of production

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#101:1:A>
What is the change in the return <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#102:1:A>
That is studied under the returns to state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#103:1:A>
So this is regarding the <,> first concept of the production
function <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#104:1:A>
Then your next will be <,> besides this you must have a idea
regarding the <}> <-> <.> tot </.> </-> <=> meaning of total </=> </}>
product average product and marginal product <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#105:1:A>
Because if you are not clear regarding that also <,> then also you
cannot understand these laws of return <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#106:1:A>
So first of all we will study the total product <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#107:1:A>
So what that is ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#108:1:S>
Product <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#109:1:A>
Now what is the meaning of <,,> total cost <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#110:1:A>
Although it is not related to you <,> this but still I want to
connect this topic with that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#111:1:A>
Total what is the total cost <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#112:1:S>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#113:1:A>
I am asking you what is the meaning of total cost <,,> ?

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#114:1:S>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#115:1:A>
Don't study at home you <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#116:1:A>
Total cost is the cost of producing a commodity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#117:1:A>
Whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional
value providing <,> is known as the total cost <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#118:1:A>
Okay and it includes fixed and variable from both <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#119:1:A>
Then you have studied the total value cocept also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#120:1:A>
What is total value <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#121:1:A>
It is the money received which is being received by the producer
<,> while selling up certain amount of commodity in the market <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#122:1:A>
Whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the
total <,> value <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#123:1:A>
Now similarly <,> the total product is the amount of the goods <,>
which are being produced <,> by a certain number of <,> producers labourers
or input whatever we are using

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#124:1:A>
By making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we
are calling it as the total <,> product <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#125:1:A>
You can write down the meaning of total product <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#126:1:A>
Be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you <,,> <&>
Begins to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#127:1:A>
Total product of a factor is <,,> total product of a factor <,,>
is <,,> the amount of the total output <,,> is the amount of the total output
<,,> produced by <,,> given amount of <,> factors <,> produced by <,,> given
amount of factors <,,> given amount of <,> factors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#128:1:A>
As the factors are increased <,,> total product also starts rising
<,,>

<$S> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#129:1:S>
Total product also <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-020#130:1:A>
Total product also start rising <,,> but the rate of
increased <,,> value <,,> but the rate of increased value <,,> at different
levels of output <,,> at different levels of output <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#131:1:A>
In the beginning <,,> in the beginning <,,> total product rises
<,,> at a increasing rate <,,> after a point <,,> after a point <,> total
product starts rising <,,> total product start rising <,,> at <,> diminishing
rate <,,> as <,,> the employment of variable factors <,,> as <,,> the
employment of variable factors <,> increases <,,> as the employment of
variable factors <,,> increases <,,> <&> ends to dictate </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#132:1:A>
Written

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#133:1:A>
Now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#134:1:A>
You you can take the number of <,> labourers <,,> and total <,>
product <,,> and total product from which you can come to know <,> how it is
<,> firstly increasing at an increasing rate <,> then it is increasing at a
diminishing rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#135:1:A>
Now accordingly then the <,> zero first labourer is here the total
product is n unit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#136:1:A>
The second labourer is employed the total product is <,,> eighteen
units <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#137:1:A>
The third <,> labourer is employed <,> it is <,> twenty-five <,>
the fourth <,> it is thirty <,> and fifth it is thirty-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#138:1:A>
And fifth labourer it is thirty-two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#139:1:A>
Now what did you come to know from this <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#140:1:A>
It is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#141:1:A>
Than it is increasing at a <,> diminishing rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#142:1:A>
Than from the first labourer <,> you have employed the second
labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen <,> there has
been the increase of eight units <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#143:1:A>
In the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the
<,> seven units

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#144:1:A>
Now in fourth case you see <,> there is the increase of only <,>
five units

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#145:1:A>
So the rate of increase is <,> decreasing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#146:1:A>
Then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the <,>
two units <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#147:1:A>
Why it is happening this <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#148:1:A>
Because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors
were more <,> and they were not being fully utilised <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#149:1:A>
When we start with second labourer <,> there was a better
utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#150:1:A>
When we employ the third then also it has increased <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#151:1:A>
But after the <,> fourth labourer we find <,> when we have
employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase <,> in the total product is
<,> diminishing

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#152:1:A>
It is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased
<,> they are getting lesser and lesser shares <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#153:1:A>
Now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this <,>
their total products starts <,> diminishing

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#154:1:A>
Okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-020#155:1:A>
Is that okay <,,> </I>
