<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#1:1:A>
<O> Laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#2:1:A>
Really <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#3:1:A>
Just imagine <,> we have to wait here for half an hour <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#4:1:B>
And just doing this <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#5:1:A>
They must be wondering what we are doing no ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#6:1:B>
Yes <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#7:1:B>
And nobody is going to find us here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#8:1:B>
because we are locked here <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#9:1:A>
Locked from outside <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#10:1:A>
Feeling nice <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#11:1:B>
But next week by this time

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#12:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#13:1:B>
Finished <,,> most of the papers

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#14:1:C>
Which <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#15:1:B>
How many days <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#16:1:A>
Two days more

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#17:1:C>
Uhn today is the final day <,> so naturally <,> we have uh
<,,> nine more days to go say <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#18:1:A>
Nine <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#19:1:C>
Isn't it ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#20:1:A>
Nine ten

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#21:1:C>
Uh ten

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#22:1:A>
Because <.> Sun </.> Sunday is also counted you know <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#23:1:C>
And whatever it is I am waiting for the thirtieth <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#24:1:B>
Ah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#25:1:C>
Because I was actually waiting for these classes and not for
the exams <,> because I know what I am going to do there <,> because I am not
at all prepared <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#26:1:A>
Even I am not prepared <,> actually we <,> hardly get any time
to study no when we work

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#27:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#28:1:A>
You know <w> it's </w> very difficult for us

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#29:1:C>
You being in college it was something different <,> and for
school we have to be there right from ten <,> to four ten <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#30:1:C>
And then our headmistress is very <,> particular about our
correction and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#31:1:C>
To add with it <,> our system is very exam oriented <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#32:1:C>
Every second day we have some examination and some correction <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#33:1:A>
Even we have exams <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#34:1:A>
In that way actually every four months or three months we have <,>
because we have pre- test and test <,> and annual and half yearly and all
this things naturally <,> it uh <,> just <,> has to be done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#35:1:A>
And our college is more like a school you know <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#36:1:B>
That uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#37:1:A>
This principal she is very particular about it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#38:1:A>
All that discipline has to be maintained you know <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#39:1:C>
But in Orissa you know Lecturers have a very nice time there
<,,> uhm <,> like there is nobody to <,> actually check on them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#40:1:C>
They may or may not take classes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#41:1:C>
And <,> children bank on the <,> tuitions <,> rather than on the
lectures <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#42:1:C>
So if you are very wealthy you do very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#43:1:C>
<w> That's </w> how it goes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#44:1:A>
See over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar
and all we don't know <w> what's </w> happening in India no the whole <,,>
<?> this way <w> it's </w> in </?> <,> such a turmoil stage and we are not
<,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#45:1:C>
We are more or less

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#46:1:B>
<?> Not bothered about </?>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#47:1:C>
We are more or less <,> more <,> we are more or less in a
linguistic island you say <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#48:1:A>
<.> Lingui </.> <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#49:1:C>
Cut off from the <{> <[> world </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#50:1:A>
<[> Cut </[> </{> off from the world

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#51:1:C>
And daily now we <.> le </.> read linguistic <,> talk
linguistic <,> walk linguistic

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#52:1:A>
And we have to be conscious of our actions and all these
things no all the time <,> can't we live free <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#53:1:A>
Actually when we return <w> we'll </w> have to <,> get into our old
habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again <,,> <O> laughs
</O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#54:1:B>
<w> That's </w> all <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#55:1:C>
Nothing to <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#56:1:A>
But I don't know what I am going to do for the exams no <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#57:1:A>
<w> It's </w> such a <,,> I have never been so unprepared <,> for
the exams <,> as I am now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#58:1:A>
Because uh <,> I just couldn't study and now <,> all the things are
coming in <,> at once

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#59:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#60:1:A>
You can get <,> you are getting to understand the whole thing
at once you know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#61:1:A>
So naturally <w> it's </w> very difficult for us to <,,> take uh
<,> things inside and capture it and then <{> <[> produce it </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#62:1:C>
<[> And repeat </[> </{> in the examination paper

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#63:1:C>
Actually <w> it's </w> very tough <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#64:1:C>
<{> <[> But </[> then <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#65:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#66:1:A>
It is <,> one way <w> it's </w> good that atleast we are
getting to know something atleast better than <,> because all of us can't
take leave <,> all of can't be accomodated in Hyderabad in C I F L <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#67:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> one way <,> we are getting a touch of it <,,> not
the whole thing but a touch of it <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#68:1:C>
Whatever it is you know I am not the results <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#69:1:C>
I was interested to get some of my <{> <[> concept </[> clear <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#70:1:C>
And I feel I was able to clear some of it I was bothered about my
pronunciation I was bothered about some of my grammatical <,,> mistakes and
all that <,> and there was nobody there whom I could approached to you see

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#71:1:C>
So I thought this course would be a great help to me <,> I am not
bothered about the result part of it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#72:1:A>
<[> Even I </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#73:1:A>
Actually because we teach in a <,> our circumstances and
surroundings are so no that we get <,> we are separated from the English
speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks English <,> only I
speak <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#74:1:A>
And whom I <,> to speak <,> in that way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#75:1:A>
<w> That's </w> why we are confined in our area <,> especially I
living in <,> this rural area these people <,> they don't even know English
nothing so <,> it becomes very difficult for me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#76:1:A>
And I was getting to forget my pronunciations also

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#77:1:A>
Now <,> you see you see Dr Jairaman <,> you want in my group today
no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#78:1:A>
Dr Jairaman check me so many time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#79:1:A>
But I I don't know how it come to <,> because I I <,> in
pronunciations I was never checked <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#80:1:A>
That was one thing spelling and pronunciation I was always right
you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#81:1:A>
But <,> just because I am not habituated with I am not <{> <[>
getting </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#82:1:C>
<[> Practice </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#83:1:C>
One thing right from school days I should say <,> uhm some of
the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#84:1:C>
And whatever I had picked up it is from the <,> media whatever it
is <,> because I had interest in it I tried to rectify myself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#85:1:C>
But whatever we were taught during our school days was something
<,> completely different <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#86:1:C>
And almost I should say it was something wrong that was taught to
us

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#87:1:C>
So I feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers <,>
they <{1> <[1> should </[1> go through these <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#88:1:C>
All the English medium <{2> <[2> school the </[2> so called English
medium schools <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#89:1:C>
The teacher should go through this sort of <,> training <,> where
they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#90:1:A>
<[1> Definitely </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#91:1:A>
<[2> It should be </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#92:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#93:1:C>
Because it is there where the base is formed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#94:1:C>
And once things get destructed there means whole life <{> <[> is
</[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#95:1:A>
<[> They </[> </{> can't change

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#96:1:C>
You can't change <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#97:1:A>
If you <.> rec </.> <w> it's </w> mean very <,> <w> it's </w>
uh <,,> difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you
know we learnt in our method <,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> this thing
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#98:1:C>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#99:1:A>
But actually I was taught in a <,> very <,> I told you last
night no that I had a very surrounding <,> and very good uh <,> people <,>
who taught me

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#100:1:A>
So it came in to me as my first language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#101:1:A>
I even forgot my mother tongue <,> when I first went into <,,>
there learning <,> not learning it was a language acquisition rather than
language learning for me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#102:1:A>
Because I was placed in that position so I am very lucky in that
way you know which I got <,> <{> <[> now how <,> but

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#103:1:C>
<{> <[> Now how </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#104:1:A>
<[> But </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#105:1:A>
Just because I am placed <,> my <,> setting now <,> the
atmosphere I live in is totally Bengali <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#106:1:A>
So naturally <,> I am getting to forget it <,> <{> <[> I </[> I
said <w> I'll </w> <,> another few days if I stay over there <w> I'll </w>
also forget the name of <.> Sha </.> the spelling of Shakespeare <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#107:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#108:1:B>
Actually you have to give

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#109:1:C>
<indig> Haan </indig> <w> that's </w> very natural <,> <&>
sneeze </&>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#110:1:C>
One thing in our place that is in <,> that is in Bhubaneshwar <,>
first and foremost if you speak English means they will alienate you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#111:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#112:1:C>
They will say that <,> means we are of <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#113:1:A>
Showing off and all these things <w> they'll </w> <{> <[> say
</[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#114:1:C>
<[> Relationship </[> </{> there becomes very formal you have
to speak in Oriya in order to be like them <,> otherwise they will just throw
you out of their group

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#115:1:A>
No but here they think that <w> they'll </w> <,> you are
showing off

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#116:1:C>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#117:1:A>
If you speak <{> <[> English </[> you are showing off

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#118:1:C>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#119:1:C>
That is another part of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#120:1:C>
And <,> one more thing another thing how I rectified myself
because all <,> almost all <,> all of us <,> all my brother and sisters we
have read in English medium school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#121:1:C>
And naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot <,> a lot

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#122:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#123:1:C>
And we used to do that in English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#124:1:C>
<{> <[> So that </[> is how we use to rectify each other and <,>
somehow we could <,,> that is how I could <,> I can speak little bit of
correct <,> <{> <[> yes <,> English <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#125:1:A>
<[> Yes it was </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#126:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#127:1:B>
But you are actually <,> the <,,> means <,> thing that they
should <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#128:1:A>
Uh I think uh <,> they should <.> e </.> extend the <,,> say
you know of this <,,> course <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#129:1:A>
It should be one and half months or two months you no

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#130:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#131:1:A>
Or they can organised the <,> contact programme and then take
the examination <{> <[> that </[> are later date because we have to <,> we
can't just read the books <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#132:1:A>
And we can't <,> form the ideas see <,> you see the <,> ways <,>
Dr this Mr V he was totally changed actually because he was uh <,> the
concepts are clear not clear to us <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#133:1:C>
<[> Of course </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#134:1:A>
We have got the book language <,> the language of the book
and we just learn it like that and we <,,> put it out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#135:1:A>
But we have to clear the concept <,> we have to get the actual
technical <.> lang </.> <,> languages <,> the term we have to get <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#136:1:A>
Like I answered the right thing today <,> I had that concept but I
didn't know <{> <[> the actual technicality </[> I have to express it <,>
because <,> in the book they are just given <,> no one explained it to us no
<w> that's </w> why

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#137:1:B>
<[> Yeah how to express it </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#138:1:C>
For that we need one more month

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#139:1:B>
One more month yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#140:1:C>
This <{> <[> is too short </[> <,> actually

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#141:1:A>
<[> <w> That's </w> what <w> I'm </w> suggesting </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#142:1:C>
They should have the programme

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#143:1:B>
Programme

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#144:1:C>
Programme and then <{> <[> afterwards </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#145:1:B>
<[> And then </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#146:1:A>
The exams afterwards

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#147:1:C>
They should they should

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#148:1:B>
They should do that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#149:1:C>
It should have that way

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#150:1:B>
Yeah <,> the organisation

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#151:1:C>
And now <,> uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#152:1:B>
Crammed isn't it any way

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#153:1:C>
It is difficult and I think in lingistic paper I am going to
write my literature in my literature paper <w> I'll </w> do my politics <O>
laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#154:1:B>
I don't know what I am going to do <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#155:1:A>
Oh yours <,> your head is not reeling any more no <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#156:1:C>
No <,> in the morning I had a tough time <,> I thought I was
going to fall down

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#157:1:A>
Even I thought I was <.> fal </.> you wouldn't feel to go
also I was getting quite scared you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#158:1:A>
But I was <,> definite it was because of the food <,> yesterday
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#159:1:C>
Not

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#160:1:A>
Should have

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#161:1:C>
I think it was my pressure <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#162:1:A>
Pressure went up <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#163:1:C>
May be <,> the pressure has gone up high again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#164:1:C>
And I <{> <[> was </[> scared

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#165:1:A>
<[> But you </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#166:1:A>
You got medicine for it <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#167:1:C>
No I didn't bring my medicine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#168:1:A>
Why ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#169:1:C>
Because I am very bad at taking medicine <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#170:1:A>
No but should you know these are <,> life saving drugs you
know you should keep them

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#171:1:C>
So that is the <,> that was the problem and today <,> if I
wouldn't have taken little rest I don't know what I would have done
throughout the day <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#172:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#173:1:A>

was upset <w> that's </w> why <,,> the pressure up <,> it must be

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#174:1:C>
Upset no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#175:1:A>
Upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all
the gas formation and all that <,> it can

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#176:1:C>
I know suddenly this reeling sensation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#177:1:C>
It was something <,,> from that <,> as soon as I got up from the
bed I needed support <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#178:1:C>
I thought I was going to fall down somewhere <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#179:1:C>
So I hurriedly had everything <,> I had my bath and everything and
finally I came down to thejust <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#180:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#181:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-010#186:1:A>
She said she had sent it <,> so I said she had sent I thought
they had arranged the boys and all and I haven't given my name <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#187:1:A>
So I said I won't take it <,> I said take it back please I won't
take it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#188:1:A>
She should have told me Miss <,> Ranjana sent it <,> then I could
have <,,> because it was also not good to sent the <,> refuse the thing back
no

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#189:1:A>
It was <,,> but I told her <,> I explained that I didn't know it
actually <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-010#190:1:A>
