<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#1:1:A>
Hi Chitra <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#2:1:B>
Fine thank you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#3:1:A>
When did you come from Amrawati

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#4:1:B>
On sixth of November <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#5:1:A>
How are you liking Kolhapur <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#6:1:B>
Now I am adjusting to it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#7:1:A>
Why you didn't like it initially

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#8:1:B>
No <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#9:1:A>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#10:1:A>
Why you don't like the <,,> uhm climate here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#11:1:B>
Climate is okay the people are not uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#12:1:C>
People are very nice <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#13:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#14:1:C>
Climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal
climate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#15:1:C>
So <,,> we don't like this dry climate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#16:1:C>
I don't feel <,> familiar at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#17:1:C>
I like <?> straight </?> and perspiration then only I feel at home
otherwise no <O> laughter </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#18:1:A>
But uh <,,> I like <,> uh the climate here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#19:1:A>
<w> It's </w> nice and cool <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#20:1:A>
And uh <,> though the people are slightly <,> uh from the <,,>
Bhosle family or the Shahu family and

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#21:1:C>
They are royal people <{> <[> all are royal people </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#22:1:B>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#23:1:A>
They talk and uh <,> behave that way uhn <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#24:1:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#25:1:A>
Courteous behaviour

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#26:1:B>
Having the arrogance of the <,> aristocrat

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#27:1:A>
Aren't they soft spoken <,> like the Nagpur people <,> <{> <[>
no <,> full of courtesy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#28:1:B>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#29:1:C>
In Nagpur uh <,> Nagpur uh population is very much affected by
<,> the non-marathi I think

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#30:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#31:1:C>
That is why <,> uhm their <,> behaviour has slightly undergone
some change

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#32:1:A>
Uh changed means that <indig> nazakat </indig> of Hindi
language <,> <w> that's </w> in your

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#33:1:C>
That way of speaking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#34:1:C>
And uh specially the business community is affected by Punjabis and
Sindhis

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#35:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#36:1:C>
So they are naturally more polite <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#37:1:C>
But here the <,> business community is dominated by <,> either
Brahmins or <,> perhaps <,> Marathas

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#38:1:A>
Local Kolhapuris

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#39:1:C>
Local Kolhapuri <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#40:1:C>
So they <,> are very arrogront in their uh <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#41:1:A>
Only tone <,,> sort of arrogance but <,,> inwardly they are
<,> very uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#42:1:C>
No <,> we have had bad uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#43:1:A>
Is it so

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#44:1:C>
Experience

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#45:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> very bad experience <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#46:1:B>
They are very I mean uh <,,> to make friends they take a lot of
time I don't know why

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#47:1:A>
Yeah <,> are they so choosy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#48:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> <,> <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#49:1:C>
No even an ordinary <,> uh <indig> rickshawallah </indig> or a
shopkeeper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#50:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#51:1:C>
Will uh <,,> won't talk to you <,> in a very polite manner
like <,> he is not bothered whether his <,,> product is <,> sold or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#52:1:C>
He is more bothered that <,> if he <{> <[> like you </[> want to
bargain <,> he says just keep it down and get lost <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#53:1:A>
<[> Tells you </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#54:1:C>
And bargaining on <,> our side is very <,> normal sort of a
thing <,> <{> <[> yeah yeah <,,> these days

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#55:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#56:1:A>
Every where in the cities bargaining will go on <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#57:1:C>
So also our hostel uh <,> staff who are working <,,> including
the warden the <indig> bai </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#58:1:A>
She breaks over very

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#59:1:C>
Sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#60:1:C>
They just want to <,> do what is their <,> <{> <[> alloted job </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#61:1:A>
<[> According to </[> </{> the rule

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#62:1:C>
Alloted work <,> <w> that's </w> all <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#63:1:A>
Might be for years together they have been doing the same job
fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#64:1:C>
But uh <,> in our area people are ready to earn a <,> extra
buck <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#65:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#66:1:C>
Here even if you are ready to pay them <,> they will not uh
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#67:1:B>
Maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#68:1:A>
Yeah <,> and ego is <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#69:1:B>
<{> <[> Egoism is there at a very high rate </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#70:1:A>
<[> And there is too much awareness yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#71:1:C>
Too much awareness about their working hours

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#72:1:A>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#73:1:C>
Their right time is over okay <,,> no work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#74:1:C>
In uh Nagpur

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#75:1:B>
And one <,> fine thing we found in Kolhapur is that people are
I think so not too much addicted you see <,> drinks <,,> or <indig> paan
</indig> or something of that sort

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#76:1:A>
Yeah <{> <[> these two things </[> are common in my town

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#77:1:B>
<[> Because that is very less </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#78:1:B>
In our side you see <,> Vidarbha region

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#79:1:A>
<indig> Paan </indig> do you say about <indig> paan </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#80:1:B>
Ah yeah Vidarbha side <,> we <?> see </?> less <indig> paan
</indig> shops here <{> <[> anywhere addicted and all </[> drunkards and all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#81:1:A>
<[> Yeah the spots of uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#82:1:A>
That means many <indig> paan </indig> shops <,> are there in
<O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#83:1:B>
You see in Amrawati you will find people lying you know <{>
<[> drunk <,> heavily <}> <-> drunked </-> <+> drunk </+> </}> <,> lot and
lots of people know specially those </[> rickshaw puller <,> I mean lower
strata public

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#84:1:A>
<[> Is it so

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#85:1:A>
I had totally different ideas about Amravati </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#86:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#87:1:B>
I mean from the lower strata

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#88:1:A>
<indig> Ekka </indig> we call that sort of rickshaw

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#89:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> no <,> <{> <[> cycle rickshaw </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#90:1:A>
<[> Cycle rickshaw </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#91:1:C>
Cycle rickshaw and all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#92:1:B>
So all of <{> <[> them are heavily drunk </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#93:1:C>
<[> Cycle rickshaws are there </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#94:1:C>
That population is the largest in working

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#95:1:B>
Even the auto people

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#96:1:A>
<O> One word </O> cycle rickshaw

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#97:1:B>
Even the auto <.> pe </.>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#98:1:A>
Don't you think <w> it's </w> <,> inhuman rather

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#99:1:C>
No no <,> <w> it's </w> the cheapest form of transports still
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#100:1:C>
And the buses are very few

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#101:1:B>
Even these auto rickshaw <indig> wallah </indig> people are
all drunk <,> mostly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#102:1:B>
And they <w> it's </w> very terrifying

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#103:1:B>
Here that way <w> it's </w> quite safe

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#104:1:C>
Till you get down you don't <{> <[> have any guarantee </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#105:1:B>
<[> Ah here <w> it's </w> very </[> </{> secure <,> they are
arrogant they are all you see <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#106:1:A>
No safe driving you know

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#107:1:B>
No good mannered also or rather we can say character wise
also <,> having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the
influence of Tarabai

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#108:1:A>
And most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#109:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#110:1:C>
Just now I came know he was B Com person

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#111:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#112:1:A>
So now-a-days they don't get job <,> and instead of <,>
hunting <{> <[> the job </[> they prefer that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#113:1:B>
<[> Maybe </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#114:1:B>
That may be the reason one of the reasons

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#115:1:A>
These two things are really good in them <,> alcoholism is
less <,> <indig> paan </indig> eating is less <,> and honesty is there <{>
<[> still there </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#116:1:C>
<[> Compartively </[> </{> in our area <indig> paan </indig>
eating is uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#117:1:A>
Still less <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#118:1:C>
Yeah still less <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#119:1:A>
Ha ha <,> here I think that uh <indig> paan </indig> eating
is more <,> <{> <[> no no <,,> so that compared to your region

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#120:1:C>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#121:1:B>
No there are few <indig> paan </indig> and all they don't
very less

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#122:1:A>
Very less I feel see <,> otherwise Kolhapur and <indig> paan
</indig> closely associated

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#123:1:B>
There even our college students you know they take that
<indig> tambaku </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#124:1:C>
Is it so <,> oh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#125:1:B>
<w> That's </w> it

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#126:1:C>
So they are your <indig> gurus </indig> <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#127:1:A>
And here

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#128:1:B>
And smoking is also very great among the students there in
Vidarbha region <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#129:1:B>
And here <{> <[> we don't find the students smoking this smoking
and all </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#130:1:A>
<[> Now Americans and Westerners </[> </{> they know the
evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#131:1:B>
Ha only statuatory warning is there <{> <[> but <w> it's </w>
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#132:1:A>
<[> But I think that that also gone for </[> </{> picking up
on style nothing else

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#133:1:C>
Reduced now <,> because it is this TV influence in every
thing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#134:1:A>
Yeah yeah yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#135:1:C>
But here it is becoming lesser

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#136:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what I feel

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#137:1:C>
And we know actually this no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#138:1:B>
Ha

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#139:1:C>
But some people you know they read the statutory warning
laugh and they start smoking

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#140:1:A>
Uhm start smoking and <w> that's </w> true

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#141:1:C>
Once you get into a habit <,> nothing can stop you <,,> not
even alcohol

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#142:1:A>
As your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to
cigarette smoking <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#143:1:B>
Maybe to keep the company these students force <indig> na
</indig> <,> the friends

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#144:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#145:1:B>
And in order to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#146:1:A>
You can't oppose <,> when you are in minority and they are in
majority you can't oppose otherwise <w> they'll </w> laugh at me

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#147:1:B>
That is why uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#148:1:A>
It happens sometimes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#149:1:B>
That fear <,> of public opinion compulsory to <,,> take

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#150:1:C>
Otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of
<O> one word </O> in their company they will laugh at you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#151:1:A>
It happens you know <,> someone is uh rather behaving
decently <,> then other people they laugh at them and he feels <{> <[> very
guilty about them yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#152:1:B>
<[> <w> It's </w> the style of <O> one word </O> </[> </{> if
you see a gentleman like that way <,> to smoke <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#153:1:C>

<[> Unassuming </[> </{> yeah really I wanted to use the same
word and uh <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#176:1:C>
Very few persons are like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#177:1:C>
But in our University we can almost <{> <[> feel the </[> <,>
levels of corruption <,> which you can't feel here

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#178:1:B>
<[> Feel that </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#179:1:B>
Very high level

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#180:1:A>
Everywhere it is

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#181:1:B>
No here here you see there is less corrupt

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#182:1:C>
You can't bribe them you see

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#183:1:A>
It is there or <w> it's </w> not there we are not going to
judge but

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#184:1:C>
Actually we don't see these

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#185:1:B>
No no we saw them bribing those ladies you know <,> to sweep
and all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#186:1:B>
They were not ready to sweep

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#187:1:B>
There is no it doesn't come in our duty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#188:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> not easy to bribe them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#189:1:B>
They have that <,> self-decency or <,> self-honesty as Shubha said
<,> they have maintained it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#190:1:B>
Or may be that royal blood still <,> frozen their vein

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#191:1:C>
In our University <,> no one bothers to do anything

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#192:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#193:1:C>
You just give them anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#194:1:C>
Now <?> it </?> more dominates on the <,> class one <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#195:1:A>
Ours is also <,> worst it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#196:1:A>
They won't accept <,> and they won't move

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#197:1:C>
No but if <,> there if you give any extra money <,> anything
can be done

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#198:1:A>
Anything can be done

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#199:1:C>
But here <,> it is the other way round

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#200:1:B>
Even take marklist <O> one word </O> <O> laughter </O> at
twelfth standarad level board Amarawati Board is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#201:1:A>
Hazard of thinking

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#202:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#203:1:A>
So we should thank <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#204:1:C>
Dr Shastri <,> and Professor Karande and now we should
conclude <,> for what he has <,,> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#205:2:A>
When when is you paper reading <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#206:2:A>
When is your paper reading

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#207:2:C>
I don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth <,> <{> <[> but
uh Jahagirdar said </[> <,> put anywhere now

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#208:2:B>
<[> You got chances no </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#209:2:A>
Any where

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#210:2:C>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#211:2:A>
So you have to be prepared anyday

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#212:2:C>
Yeah yeah <,> <w> I'am </w> already prepared <,> with my
casette on <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#213:2:C>
I am going to <{> <[> show it through the cassette </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#214:2:A>
<[> Well how did you </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#215:2:A>
How did you shoot the cassette like with who was the
cameraman <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#216:2:C>
Yeah <,> Ganesh <O> one word </O> he is a professional and
<w> he's </w> my cameraman and he is a student of Shrikant Madhushri <,> from
J J School of Arts

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#217:2:C>
And he has got his own studio in Ratnagiri <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#218:2:C>
And he is our friend <,,> so <,> straightway <,> we can say <,>
Ganesh company and we can just drop it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#219:2:A>
But how did you get this idea that uh <,> you should make a
video and

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#220:2:C>
Actually in the class you know I make free use of <,>
cassettes <,> for my kids <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#221:2:C>
So we show them one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#222:2:C>
But this was for the first time <,> otherwise that <,> shooting
job my husband used to do for me <,> or Ganesh <,,> but uh <,,> sometimes I
felt I should learn atleast samething of it

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#223:2:C>
I cannot handle the camera <,> so video camera so confidently <,>
but I am comparatively good at outdoors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#224:2:C>
Indoors and closeups I had to take help of my husband and Ganesh
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#225:2:C>
But then <,> editing <,> commentary writing <,> dubbing <,,> then
introducing the third scene of Santoor <,> everything I have done <,> only
Ganesh was there <,> he used to give me occasional instructions like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#226:2:C>
And camera handling actually outdoor <,> landscaping <,,> that
landscape shot <,> I have taken and actually the close ups <,> and some parts
of your <,> architectural shots of that building <,> Ganesh took my husband
took <,> and close ups of the faces my husband and Ganesh took

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#227:2:A>
But uh uhm <,> like how did you <,> uhm how do you use your
video for <,> uh teaching every day teaching

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#228:2:C>
Everyday teaching means not in the class <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#229:2:A>
Not in the class

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#230:2:C>
In the class <,> uh there is questions and answers session

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#231:2:B>
After the lecture

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#232:2:C>
Group discussion class uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#233:2:A>
Your which classes do you teach <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#234:2:C>
Uh right from F Y B A to M A two

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#235:2:A>
What is F Y B A <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#236:2:C>
<{> <[> F Y is </[> the first year

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#237:2:B>
<[> First year </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#238:2:A>
Uhn

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-046#239:2:C>
B A to M A <,> part one and M A part two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#240:2:C>
So after my working hours you know I am having about free periods
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#241:2:C>
Even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#242:2:C>
<w> I'll </w> take them to <,> we have got such <,> sound proof AC
room <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#243:2:C>
<w> It's </w> actually computer room we have got ten computers <,>
but is just like a hall remaining part is <,> unoccupied you know and there
are chairs semicircular monitor is there

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#244:2:C>
So straight away we can take <,> facility of that room <,> and our
principal <,> cabin it has got one set T V set monitor <,> uh video is there
<,> and even that is sound proof and AC <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#245:2:C>
So only five or six students are there

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#246:2:C>
Sometime <,> they come in group for <,,> explanation and asking
their doubts and difficulties

<ICE-IND:S1A-046#247:2:C>
So I can <,> take them to the <w> principal's </w> cabin <,> that
way <w> he's </w> very generous </I>
