<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#1:1:A>
Good morning sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#2:1:A>
I am Mukta Mahajan <,> I have come from Jalgaon <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#3:1:A>
And uh <,,> my city is developing city <,,> and <,,> we are the
natives of that city <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#4:1:A>
My <,> father is retired lecturer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#5:1:A>
I have three sisters <,> and one brother <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#6:1:A>
Ours is the family of teachers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#7:1:A>
And <,> I have got the inspiration particularly from my father <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#8:1:A>
My father <,> always <,> tells me that the <,,> position of a
teacher <,,> is of <,> a person <,> who guides the society <,> who guides the
complete generation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#9:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why I have selected <,> this particular
profession <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#10:1:B>
<w> It's </w> nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic
<,,> family I should say <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#11:1:A>
<w> It's </w> really true sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#12:1:B>
And what brings you here all the way from Jalgaon to Kolhapur
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#13:1:A>
I have come to attend the refresher course in English <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#14:1:B>
Have you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#15:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#16:1:B>
Is it your first <,,> or <,,> second

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#17:1:A>
It is the first refresher course <,,> I am attending <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#18:1:A>
And I am feeling very nice <,> that I am in the company of so
brilliant brains <,,> and particulary the people I find here they are really
<,> sunshine brain and moonshine heart <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#19:1:B>
<indig> Wah </indig> very nice <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#20:1:B>
And <,> how do you find the courses <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#21:1:B>
Do you think that they have colleges wherever <,> to what you teach
in the classes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#22:1:A>
I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#23:1:B>
One difficulty is or one <,,> uhm shall I suggest these
courses is that <,,> they are only <,,> of an academic nature <,,> very
little to do with <,> grammarian work in the classes <,> <{> <[> ahn <,> do
you agree with this charge <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#24:1:A>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#25:1:A>
Yes I do agree with this charge because <,> the classroom
situation is completely different <,,> and we are <,> uh told here <,,> about
<,> ideal conditions

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#26:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#27:1:A>
If we cannot really apply reality <,> and while teaching a
particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart
from the <,,> teaching itself <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#28:1:B>
Yet you agree that ideals are good enough <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#29:1:A>
Of course we need them <,> <{> <[> to follow <,,> of course we
need them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#30:1:B>
<[> To follow </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#31:1:B>
We may say that ideals <,,> will cease to be ideals if they
are attainable <,> won't they <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#32:1:A>
Yes it is really sir <,> it is really true

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#33:1:A>
But unless we have ideals then we will go astray <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#34:1:B>
They do show us a direction <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#35:1:A>
Sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#36:1:B>
And give us <,> where we have to go and where we stand <,>
don't they <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#37:1:A>
We may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of
lighthouse <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> and we have to travel in that direction

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#38:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#39:1:B>
So it <w> it's </w> a <O> one word </O> light you may say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#40:1:A>
Sir <,> yes sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#41:1:B>
That guides you on your career

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#42:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#43:1:B>
And how about this Kolhapur <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#44:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very fantastic city <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#45:1:A>
For the first time I am enjoying the rain and cold and really
thrilling one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#46:1:A>
And the beauty of nature and the greenery <,> <w> it's </w> really
fantastic <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#47:1:B>
You don't have this in Jalgaon

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#48:1:A>
No no no <,> <w> it's </w> completely hot and so <,> so hot
<,> that it becomes impossible for outsiders <,> to stay in Jalgaon during
the month of <,> uh April and May particularly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#49:1:B>
And perhaps you find it difficult to be here <{> <[> from your
</[> <O> a few words </O> I believe

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#50:1:A>
<[> Yes sir </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#51:1:A>
I I am feeling completely migrated bird <,> you know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#52:1:B>
Do you <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#53:1:A>
Yes sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#54:1:B>
But how is the migration <,> from bad to worse <,,> or good to
bad

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#55:1:A>
Well <,> from bad to good <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#56:1:B>
Bad to good

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#57:1:A>
Because man needs water <}> <-> to his </-> <=> to his <=>
</}> roots <,> so that <,> uh as bud will come out and <,> man will flourish
<,> and here I am really feeling that sense of <,> flowering <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#58:1:B>
Nice <,> you are paying a very rich tribute to Kolhapur <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#59:1:A>
It <{> <[> it </[> deserves sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#60:1:B>
<[> And </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#61:1:B>
And what about the historicity of this place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#62:1:B>
Have you visited any historical place

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#63:1:A>
Uhn ufortunately I could not sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#64:1:A>
Unfortunately I could not because uh rain is so heavy that I dare
not to go outside <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#65:1:B>
Lack of opportunity not interest <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#66:1:A>
No I I really interest <,> I have really interest in seeing
the sight which are you <,> know well known for <,> historical importance <,>
but due to lack of <{> <[> opportunity </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#67:1:B>
<[> Because of </[> </{> the vacation <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#68:1:A>
Yes sir <,> but I am I am deciding <,> to visit the places <,>
on Sunday <,> <{> <[> some place </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#69:1:B>
<[> There are </[> </{> different forts here you kown <,,>
<mention> Panhalgad </mention> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#70:1:A>
Yes sir I know it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#71:1:B>
You must be knowing this all history don't you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#72:1:A>
No sir <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#73:1:B>
You don't know the importance of <mention> Panhalgad
</mention>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#74:1:B>
You don't mean that you don't know it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#75:1:A>
Pardon sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#76:1:B>
You don't mean that you don't know <mention> Panhalgad
</mention> and <w> it's </w> importance <{> <[> in Maratha history </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#77:1:A>
<[> I I I have read </[> </{> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#78:1:A>
Yes I have read a lot about <,> and I have also asked my friends
that we will <,> we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be
impossible to go there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#79:1:A>
And none of them is ready <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#80:1:B>
That is one of the forts you know <,,> that immortalise that
great partriot <,> <{> <[> of course <,> <{> <[> Baji Prabhu </[> Deshpande
<,> who helped Shivaji to escape from there <,> from the seige <,> of Siddhi
Johar at <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#81:1:A>
<[> Of course </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#82:1:A>
<[> Of course </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#83:1:A>
I have gone through the history

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#84:1:B>
I had been there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#85:1:B>
We had a taxi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#86:1:B>
It was a nice experience going there

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#87:1:B>
And unlike other forts <,> <w> it's </w> not tiring business for
<,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> of environment

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#88:1:A>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#89:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#90:1:B>
You can take your taxi on the top <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#91:1:B>
We can visit the places in the <,> conveyer <,> <{> <[> uhn <,> and
<w> it's </w> very less tiring job <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#92:1:B>
And there is another place also nearby <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#93:1:A>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#94:1:A>
Which one <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#95:1:B>
It is one <,> uh <O> two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#96:1:A>
I like that main building particularly <,> that statue of
Shivaji Maharaj <,> <{> <[> <O> one word </O> still </[> it seems going to
sky <,> from the earth going from <,> uhm to mean place to some where highest
place and <,,> I really like that statue

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#97:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> that </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#98:1:B>
Great men do have an elevating effect you know <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#99:1:A>
Sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#100:1:B>
When you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going
higher and higher

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#101:1:A>
Higher and higher <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#102:1:A>
I really like that statue and I <,> whenever I get a chance I go
there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure <,,> and the <{>
<[> atmosphere </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#103:1:B>
<[> That means </[> </{> <,> that means it must be quite an
effort for a frail person like you <,> <O> laughter </O> to do all these
things

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#104:1:A>
It means both things I try to achieve <,> just <w> it's </w>
a kind of exercise for me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#105:1:A>
And because I need it and I never get a chance in my city to go
out <,> and uh <,> because <w> it's </w> so crowded and particulary there are
no places <,> in our city <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#106:1:A>
When I come here in this <,> uh area of University <,> <w> it's
</w> really lovely place

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#107:1:B>
You are coming for the first time <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#108:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#109:1:B>
You have never been this side <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#110:1:A>
No <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#111:1:B>
How did you come <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#112:1:A>
By train <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#113:1:B>
By train

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#114:1:A>
By train <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#115:1:B>
You must be finding the journey very <,> tiresome

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#116:1:A>
Very tiresome <w> it's </w> a long journey

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#117:1:B>
Especially after Poona <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#118:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#119:1:A>
If the train becomes passenger <,> and uh unbearable journey it
becomes <,> but I have no other way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#120:1:A>
Uhn <,> which is convenient way <,> to come to Kolhapur

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#121:1:B>
When are you leaving <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#122:1:A>
On twenty first <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#123:1:C>
On twenty first <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#124:1:B>
The course is <,> I think <,> <O> one word </O> we finished
on the nineteenth

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#125:1:A>
But I have got the reservation of twenty first <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#126:1:B>
So you are overstaying a little

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#127:1:A>
Yes sir <,> for one day

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#128:1:B>
Thanks to <O> one word </O> reservations <,> <O> laughter
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#129:1:A>
So that I will be able to visit the places I couldn't

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#130:1:C>
Ah you will have go shopping

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#131:1:B>
<{> <[> Right </[> a day gap

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#132:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#133:1:C>
Shopping <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#134:1:A>
No I am not interested in shopping whenever I go to market I
buy books only that is all <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#135:1:B>
So you are a bibliophile <O> laughter </O> aren't you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#136:1:B>
So I would better ask you to go to the <,> Mahalaxmi temple <,>
have you been there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#137:1:A>
Yes <w> I've </w> been there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#138:1:B>
How you find the temple <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#139:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very lovely <,> here one gets the <,> you say
<,> <.> per </.> perfect religious atmosphere and uh <,> the faith in man
grows when we go in the company of <,,> that structure only <,,> I I didn't I
couldn't go inside the temple <,> because I was in hurry but I have decided
to go there <,> on Sunday

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#140:1:C>
Do go inside <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#141:1:A>
Of course sir <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#142:1:C>
Because the <O> one word </O> and <O> two words </O> is very
beautiful in name of the goddess

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#143:1:A>
Outside <,> <{> <[> observation won't do always </[> it
becomes necessary to go inside and <,> experience it

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#144:1:C>
<[> And there are lights also there </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#145:1:B>
Unless you enter a temple <,> <O> laughter </O> it is no
visit to a temple you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#146:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#147:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not a place of tourists interest

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#148:1:A>
But I have heard that fold your hands and your <,> uh prayers
reach to god <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#149:1:B>
They do <,> if you have faith

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#150:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#151:1:A>
There is no need of going to temple <,> just fold your hands <,>
and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#152:1:B>
They do <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#153:1:A>
And it will come true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#154:1:A>
And many times I had experienced it that I couldn't get a chance
to go to temple <,,> and uh I just pray in heart and my wishes come true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#155:1:A>
One of my wish has come true that is uh <,> acheiving this
doctorate <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#156:1:B>
Yes you have achieved a doctorate <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#157:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#158:1:B>
What did you <,> make research <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#159:1:A>
American literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#160:1:A>
I am interested in American literature and uh <,,> I have taken
the subject uh <,> in that uh uh <mention> A study of prose style of Ernest
Hemingway with special reference to his novels </mention>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#161:1:B>
Hemingway <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#162:1:A>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#163:1:B>
But who was your guide by the way <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#164:1:A>
Uh presently he is the vice-Chancellor of Indore University
<,> Dr S H Chandel <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#165:1:B>
We have heard <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#166:1:A>
Of course <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#167:1:B>
Yes you were fortunate enough to get hold of him

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#168:1:A>
Of course of course <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-066#169:1:A>
It was a nice experience for me <,> to live in his company and to
share his <,> uh knowledge <,,> and to enlighten myself <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-066#170:1:B>
Did you publish your <,> research <,>
