<h> <bold> Turmoil in the valley </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#2:1>
IT is now disturbingly clear that the weak-kneed-ness of the
National Front Government has become an irresistible temptation to Pakistan,
whose leaders, irrespective of their party affiliations, are vying with one
another in fuelling the turmoil of vile communal passions in the Kashmir
valley.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#3:1>
There has been an exodus of the families of the minority community
from the communally virulent valley, which seems to have been taken over by
the Pakistan-trained subversives.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#4:1>


<ICE-IND:W2E-002#5:1>
According to one estimate, about 19,000 families have so far migrated
from the valley to Jammu and other parts of the country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#6:1>
One can guage the fear psychosis in the valley from the remarks made
by some of the migrants.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#7:1>
One of them has reportedly said: <quote> " We do not intend to return
to the deafening and spine-chilling calls through loudspeakers from atop
mosques." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#8:1>
And Union Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, while conceding in the
<indig> Lok Sabha </indig> the other day that there had been an exodus of
people from the valley, sought to reassure members that the situation in the
border State did not have communal overtones.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#9:1>
On the same day, Prime Minister V.P.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#10:1>
Singh said in the <indig> Rajya Sabha </indig> that <w> Pakistan's
</w> recent pronouncements and actions bearing on Kashmir were unfriendly
acts.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#11:1>
One wishes he had gone a step further and warned Pakistan of dire
consequences if it persisted in interfering in <w> India's </w> internal
affairs.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#12:1>
The best way to know that Pakistan is really up to is to follow a
policy of hot pursuit of the saboteurs aided and abetted by Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#13:1>
That the feeble warnings administered by the Indian Government so far
have had no effect on Islamabad is evident from Pakistan Prime Minister
Benazir <w> Bhutto's </w> announcement of Rs. <indig> 10-crore </indig>
<quote> " humanitarian aid" </quote> to the seditionaries in the Indian
State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#14:1>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#15:1>
On the heels of it comes the setting up of a fund, by <w>
Pakistan's </w> Punjab Province Chief Minister Nawaz Sharif, with an initial
sume of <indig> Rs.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#16:1>
</indig> five <indig> crores </indig> , to help the militants in
Kashmir.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#17:1>
What else is it but naked intervention in <w> India's </w> internal
affairs?

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#18:1>
If the Kashmir valley is now denuded of the minority community, it is
the direct result of the venomous communalism being spread by Pakistani
agents.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#19:1>
Those who are rending asunder the traditional communal harmony in the
valley must know that the consequences of what they are doing will not remain
confined to Kahsmir.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#20:1>
It is bound to trigger communal passions in other parts of the
sub-continent.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#21:1>
Not even the late President Zia-Ul-Haq, who had become notorious for
his wily politics, resorted to intervention in Kashmir so blantantly as at
present.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#22:1>
This has given rise to the suspicion in the Indian mind that
something in the Indian political scenario is tempting the Pakistani leaders
to make another attempt to annex the Indian State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#23:1>
If Pakistan made such an attempt, it would be the beginning of many
more problems, particularly for Pakistan, whose vulnerability to schismatic
regionalism is well-known.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#24:1>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#25:1>
Running parallel to Pakistani provocation are the daily murders
being committed by the mulitants.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#26:1>
And it is for the benefit of those muderers that Pakistan has set up
two funds!

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#27:1>
In the numerous intrigues that Pakistan has launched, there is
something more than meets the eye.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#28:1>
Now is the time for the Indian leaders to call a spade a spade and
tell Pakistan that another war over Kashmir would lead to a situation that
might pose a threat to its own existence.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#29:1>
Let it not happen.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#30:1>
It is time Pakistani leaders realised that the rise of
fundamentalist forces in India is a consequence of their reckless communal
policy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#31:1>
And the Indian leaders would be well-advised to ensure the safe
return of those who have been hounded out of the valley.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#32:1>

<h> <bold> Whither Pakistan?

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#34:2>
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#35:2>
PAKISTAN is back to square one.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#36:2>
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, a stalking-horse of the Army, has
uprooted the nascent Pakistani democracy with a vengeance.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#37:2>
The civilian facade that has been erected in place of the dismissed
Benazir Bhutto Government is intended to silence criticism abroad.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#38:2>
According to unconfirmed reports received yesterday, Mrs.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#39:2>
Bhutto was placed under house arrest.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#40:2>
The Presidential action in dismissing the elected Government and
dissolving the National Assembly is a repetition of what the late President
Zia-ul-Haq did in May 1988.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#41:2>
Gen.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#42:2>
<w> Zia's </w> contention was that law and order under the Junejo
administration had broken down.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#43:2>
In a futile bid to justify the cold-blooded murder of democracy on
Monday, Mr.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#44:2>
Ishaq Khan said that the superior judiciary had been publicly
ridiculed and that the authority, resources and agencies of the Government
had been misused for political and personal ends.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#45:2>
How long had this been going on?

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#46:2>
One would like to know whether the President had administered a
warning to the Government before he took the extreme step of winding up the
Government and the National Assembly lock, stock and barrel.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#47:2>
It is well known that the Pakistani Army, which is known to abound
with Zia loyalists, did not take kindly to the restoration of democracy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#48:2>
At the time of the formation of the Benazir Government, the Army,
with the help of Washington, wrested many powers from the Prime Minister.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#49:2>
The Army must have loomed large in Mrs.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#50:2>
<w> Bhutto's </w> mind.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#51:2>
It would be naive to think that the Army has not been involved in
policies, as Army chief, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg has said.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#52:2>
Even while keeping up the appearance of non-involvement in politics,
the Army resorted to peaceful penetration of the Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#53:2>
It is the Army that has created a situation wherein Mrs. Bhutto had
to compete with other political leaders in reviving the Kashmir issue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#54:2>
This is an old Pakistani game. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#55:2>
Like her predecessors, Mrs. Bhutto too had to play that dangerous
game.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#56:2>
The partisan resolution passed by the Organisation of Islamic
Conference in Cairo last week on Jammu and Kashmir was entirely the result of
Mrs. <w> Bhutto's </w> efforts.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#57:2>
Where exactly has Mrs. Bhutto failed to come up to the democratic
expectations of her people?

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#58:2>
Admittedly, while yielding to domestic political compulsions, she did
many things which had an adverse effect on the already slow-paced
normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#59:2>
Did the President and his powerful backers in the Army expect Mrs.
Bhutto to work miracles?

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#60:2>
With the slender majority that her Government enjoyed in the National
Assembly, she was doing her best to tackle the national problems.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#61:2>
She seems to have incurred the wrath of the Army by refusing to go
along with it on the question of tackling the strife in Sind.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#62:2>
Added to this was her opposition to the Shariat bill moved by the
fundamentalists.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#63:2>
This led to the revival of the old alliance between the Army and the
fundamentalists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#64:2>
For some time now, Mr. Ishaq Khan has been toeing the hard-line
on the Kashmir issue, which he considers to be the unfinished agenda of
partition.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#65:2>
This reflects more the <w> Army's </w> stand than the <w>
Government's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#66:2>
With the dismissal of the elected Government, which was responsive to
public opinion, India can expect a hardening of the Pakistani approach to the
Kashmir problem.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#67:2>
The constitutional head of Pakistan has acted in the most
unconstitutional and undemocratic manner.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#68:2>
It is a serious setback to the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#69:2>
And India cannot remain unconcerned at the ascendancy of the Army
with a civilian mask in Pakistan.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#70:2>
There is a danger of the Pakistani Army embarking on an armed
adventure against India. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> <w> Saddam's </w> belligerence </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#72:3>
BY declaring that <w> Iraq's </w> annexation of Kuwait is <quote>
" irreversible and for ever" </quote> , the megalomaniacal dictator, Mr.
Saddam Hussein, has made war in the gulf a dead certainty.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#73:3>
He has threatened to strike at West Asia oilfields and Israel if Iraq
is strangled by the U.S.-led campaign to drive his troops out of Kuwait.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#74:3>
The <w> dictator's </w> statement, broadcast over Baghdad Radio, is
obviously intended to bid defiance to the U.N., whose General Assembly opened
its annual session last week with a call for the restoration of the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#75:3>
If he thinks he can take on the world, he is sadly mistaken.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#76:3>
Almost the entire world sympathises with Kuwait because it has been
gobbled up by its big nighbour.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#77:3>
Involved in the gulf issue is the principle of the inadmissibility of
territorial annexation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#78:3>
This is why all the civilised nations, whatever their military
strength, have joined in the chorus of protest.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#79:3>
But the tragedy is that Mr. Saddam Hussein does not know how sadly
isolated he is from the international community.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#80:3>
The U.N. General Assembly fully reflected the global concern at
the explosive situation created by the Iraqi President.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#81:3>
The united and firm manner in which the U.N. is dealing with the Gulf
crisis will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the world.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#82:3>
If Iraq is allowed to get away with what it has done to Kuwait, it
will be a dangerous precedent for the future. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#83:3>
People the world over still remember the Baghdad Revolutionary
Command <w> Council's </w> statement, soon after the invasion on August 2,
that Iraq would withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how
fast the situation stabilised.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#84:3>
Now all that has changed.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#85:3>
Iraq has quietly made Kuwait one of its provinces.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#86:3>
While the military encirclement of Iraq is tightening frighteningly,
Mr. Saddam Hussein is selecting targets for total destruction in the event of
an armed conflict.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#87:3>
His beligerent rhetoric is provoking the U.S. to concentrate on a
military solution which, fortunately for the world, was not countenanced by
the Big-Two Summit in Helsinki.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#88:3>
But <w> Iraq's </w> irrational intransigence is making a military
solution inevitable with all its unpredictable consequences.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#89:3>
The impending cataclysm can be averted if Mr. Saddam Hussein sees the
writing on the wall and acts accordingly.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#90:3>
If he does not withdraw his troops from Kuwait, they are sure to be
thrown out, whatever the price the world has to pay for such action. </p> <*>

<h> <bold> The boozy priest </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-002#92:3>
Sorrow laced with an overdose of liquor made a South African
priest tumble into the grave at a funeral in Mbabane last week.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#93:3>
The deathly fall, which occurred after the coffin had been lowered,
sent shockwaves through the group of mourners at the grave.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#94:3>
The family of the deceased has accused the clergyman of being drunk
and said that he shook like a leaf and mumbled the same songs over and over.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#95:3>
The condition of the sorrowing priest was such that he had to be
replaced.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#96:3>
But that was a hasty step.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#97:3>
None of the accusers tried to understand the intensity of the <w>
priest's </w> grief.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#98:3>
The priest has admitted that he was not aware of what he was doing
that day because of sorrow.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#99:3>
If he was drunk, it was because he wanted to drown his sorrow in
liquor.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#100:3>
The fdw drops that he had on the sly before the funeral proved to be
a strong propellent.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#101:3>
It is difficult for the poor in spirit to rise to the spiritual
heights of the priest.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#102:3>
During the funeral, he seemed to have floated helplessly in the sea
of sorrow.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#103:3>
His fall into the grave indicates that he, in sympathy with the
departed soul, was prepared to shuffle off his mortal coil.

<ICE-IND:W2E-002#104:3>
But the unspirutuous mourners could not appreciate the spiritual
high drama of the boozy priest. </p> </I>
