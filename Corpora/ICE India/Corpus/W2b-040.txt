<ICE-IND:W2B-040#2:1>
<bold> Why do the normally disciplined lives of cells <&> centered
</&> go awry and cause cancers ? <&> centered </&> PRABIR K. CHAKRAVARTY and
TIRTHANKAR GUHA ROY <&> centered </&> find the reason in the fickleness of
genes. </bold> </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#3:1>
<bold> All </bold> forms of life on earth are exposed to agents
that cause damage to the genetic material contained within the cells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#4:1>
These agents are called <quote> 'mutagens' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#5:1>
However, the aberrations of the genome may also arise from mutagens
produced within the cell itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#6:1>
Fortunately the genetic material is a very stable structure and
various mechanisms are present within the cell to maintain the stability of
the genome.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#7:1>
But in spite of the existence of such mechanisms, damages do occur in
the genome sometimes with harmful consequences such as cancers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#8:1>
Sometimes there are gross damages and the repair mechanism cannot
cope.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#9:1>
Or else the repair mechanism is not good enough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#10:1>
In both cases genomic stability is disrupted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#11:1>
Genome instability is the root cause of many pathological conditions
including cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#12:1>
A study of genomic instabilities in cancer provides clues to
understanding the molecular basis of the dreaded disorder.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#13:1>
In DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase plays a vital role.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#14:1>
It strings together the free nucleotides into a chain, by matching
each with its complementary nucleotide on the parent strand.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#15:1>
This enzyme functions at a number of essential sites.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#16:1>
If the match between DNA nucleotides is <O> drawing </O> <O> caption
</O> <O> <&> page </&> 28 </O> successful; that is if the pairing is A-T (
Adenine-thymine ) or C-G ( Cytosine-Guanine ) ; then the incoming nucleotide
is added to the chain through a bridging phosphate group, but if a mismatched
nucleotide occurs the polymerase enzyme can remove the mismatched nucleotide
and replace it with a correct nucleotide.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#17:1>
This mechanism is known as <quote> 'proof-reading' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#18:1>
In spite of such proof-reading activity, errors do occur (
frequency of such errors is about one in every 10 billion base pairs copied )
during the DNA replication.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#19:1>
Rare errors such as these during proof-reading activity change
genetic fine structure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#20:1>
This in turn changes the gene product as well and in most cases lead
to the production of non-functional proteins.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#21:1>
But, sometimes, a variant or mutant functional protein may also be
formed due to the errors in DNA metabolism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#22:1>
Many of such proteins have the ability to turn a cell cancerous.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#23:1>
One such protein is the <it> <quote> ` mutant ras' </quote> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#24:1>
It is <O> sketch on column 1 & 2 </O> <O> caption </O> <O> sketch on
column 2 </O> <O> caption </O> the most frequently observed cancer-causing
protein in human malignant disease, being present in 30 % of all cancers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#25:1>
The function of <it> <quote> 'ras' </quote> </it> in normal cells is
not clear although it is thought to have a role in the control of cell growth
and in the maintenance of cell differentiation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#26:1>
Mutations may also arise spontaneously within the cell.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#27:1>
It has been found that most cancers arise from spontaneous errors in
normal cellular processes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#28:1>
These errors cause structural and functional instability of DNA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#29:1>
Spontaneous mutations in cancer generally arise from failure in the
DNA polymerase proof-reading activity and oxygen damage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#30:1>
Oxygen damage results when DNA reacts with free radicals ( very
highly reactive free atoms or ions) generated during normal oxidative
metabolism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#31:1>
In cells subjected to ionizing radiation such as x-rays the water
molecules break to produce hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#32:1>
In presence of oxygen, the hydrogen radical produces hydrogen
peroxide radical.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#33:1>
It is the highly reactive hydrogen peroxide molecule that induces
mutation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#34:1>
This <}> <-> is </-> <+> in </+> </}> turn could lead to cancerous
changes in the cell. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#35:1>
Another cellular error that could lead to cancer is gene
amplification.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#36:1>
Gene amplification or the production of multiple copies of a gene
leads to over-production of a specific protein.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#37:1>
This at times results in cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#38:1>
In some developmental programmes, gene amplification is a normal
event.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#39:1>
The amplification of chorion genes in the ovaries of fruitfly is one
such example.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#40:1>
But, in mammals, <O> <&> page </&> 29 </O> <O> sketch on column 1 & 2
in box </O> <O> caption </O> amplification is an unscheduled berration and
occurs mostly during the formation of a tumour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#41:1>
Twenty to thirty per cent of certain solid tumours carry amplified
cellular oncogenes - - a group of 30-50 genes present in normal cells and
which resemble the cancer causing genes found in cancer viruses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#42:1>
These genes normally remain quiescent but can get transformed and
trigger cancerous growth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#43:1>
Amplification does not affect cellular oncogenes at random.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#44:1>
It seems that some genes are preferentially amplified but the reason
for such preferential amplification of genes is not clear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#45:1>
The exact cause and mechanism of amplification is also yet to be
established.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#46:1>
Several rival theories seek to explain the mechanism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#47:1>
It is now established clearly that, amplification occurs rarely in
normal cells, but appears to become more common as cells progress towards
malignancy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#48:1>
The rate of amplification can be increased several fold by various
drugs, carcinogens ( cancer causing chemicals), and ultraviolet radiation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#49:1>
These observations have led to the hypothesis that, a variety of
agents may induce <quote> " misfiring" </quote> of replication, resulting in
the generation of amplified DNA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#50:1>
When a stretch of DNA with an oncogene on it spontaneously amplifies,
certain cellular security checks are breached.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#51:1>
This amplification allows the host cell to escape growth control.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#52:1>
It becomes mobile and invasive and may escape immune surveillance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#53:1>
Most frighteningly, these features may pass on to the daughter cells,
establishing malignant cancers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#54:1>
Since amplification of cellular oncogenes is often a recurrent
genetic abnormality in cancer cells, it looks as if amplification is the
cause and malingnant growth the consequence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#55:1>
Different levels of gene amplification have been associated with
different types of cancers depending on which gene has been amplified and to
what extent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#56:1>
The genetic material is the most conserved cellular molecule.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#57:1>
At the same time, it is the most susceptible to environmental damage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#58:1>
For example, when struck by ionizing radiation, the backbone of a DNA
molecule is often broken and when exposed to avariety of chemicals produced
either inside or outside the cell, the bases of the DNA molecule are altered
structurally or even split away from the backbone.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#59:1>
When exposed the ultraviolet ( UV ) adjacent pyrimidines on a DNA
strand interact with one another to form a covalent complex known as a dimer.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#60:1>
It is estimated that several thousand bases are lost from a cell
everyday because of these damages.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#61:1>
If such large damages occur each day, it is reasonable to assume that
a cell would be damaged.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#62:1>
However, in order to maintain stability of the DNA molecule, various
in-built cellular mechanisms repair such damages.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#63:1>
There are a variety of enzymes which appear to patrol the DNA,
searching for aberrations, alterations and distortions that they can
recognize and repair.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#64:1>
Most of the repair systems selectively remove or excise away the
damaged section of the DNA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#65:1>
The best studied excision repair system is one which is responsible
for removing pyrimidine dimers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#66:1>
In this process an <O> <&> page </&> 30 </O> enzyme makes an incision
in the backbone of the altered strand.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#67:1>
Such enzymes are called endonucleases because they cut within the DNA
strand.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#68:1>
This nick in the backbone is then recognized by an exonuclease enzyme
( enzymes which cut nucleotide from the ends ) that proceeds to remove the
section of the strand containing the dimer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#69:1>
The gap is then occupied by a polymerase enzyme that incorporates
complementary nucleotides in the gap and a DNA ligase enzyme seals the break.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#70:1>
And hey presto !

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#71:1>
The error has been corrected. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#72:1>
Insufficient or faulty ( error-prone ) <O> figure across the
entire page </O> <O> caption </O> repair of DNA may cause some types of
cancers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#73:1>
A classic example is the skin cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#74:1>
In normal individuals only prolonged and excessive exposure to
sunlight leads to skin cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#75:1>
Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum are unusually sensitive to
sunlight and run a high risk of developing skin cancers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#76:1>
In this disease, the pyrimidine dimer removal system is highly
deficient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#77:1>
Some reports suggest that skin cancers in XP patients have a higher
incidence of RAS gene mutations also. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#78:1>
There are also other conditions that make one prone to cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#79:1>
These are also thought to involve defects in NA repair mechanism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#80:1>
For example, ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , is thought of as a
chromosome breakage syndrome.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#81:1>
AT cells are sensitive to agents such as X-rays which cause gross
chromosome breakage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#82:1>
Due to inefficient repair of this type of damage, AT patients become
susceptible to cancers of the lymphatic tissues and leukaemias.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#83:1>
But the relationship between such susceptibility, DNA damage and
faulty mDNA repair is still unclear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#84:1>
Apart from malfunctioning enzymes, other factors too contribute
to genomic instability.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#85:1>
These factors are recombination and chromosomal translocation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#86:1>
Translocation is the transfer of a section of a chromosome of one
pair to a chromosome of a different pair.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#87:1>
Chromosomal recombination contributes a lot to the disruption of
genomic stability.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#88:1>
It is now clear that sites of consistent chromosomal rearrangement
pinpoint genes that are involved in transforming normal cells to cancerous
ones.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#89:1>
Our understanding of the molecular basis of chromosomal
rearrangements in cancer has been greatly facilitated by advances in gene
mapping. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#90:1>
Leukaemias and lymphomas usually have chromosomal rearrangements
that can easily be detected by special microscopy techniques.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#91:1>
Translocation seems to be the most common structural aberration
chromosomes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#92:1>
Such type of chromosomal rearrangement was first observed in a human
tumour as early as in 1960.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#93:1>
An unusually small chromosome was found in the leukaemia cells of
patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia ( CGL ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#94:1>
It was named Philadelphia chromosome.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#95:1>
Later it was found that Philadelphia chromosome is derived from a
reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#96:1>
The oncogene C-able on chromosome 9 becomes transferred to the
Philadelphia chromosome as a result of the translocation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#97:1>
C-sis gene is transferred from chromosome 22 to chromosome 9 as a
result of translocation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#98:1>
Tumour metastasis is a complex process in which cells migrate
from a primary tumor and colonize other organs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#99:1>
Tumor metastasis is difficult to treat and is the major cause of
death due to cancer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#100:1>
The most potent question in this regard is whether metastasis is a
genetically controlled phenomenon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#101:1>
To date 10 oncogenes have been identified which can induce
metastasis when introduced into a tumour cell line.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#102:1>
But oncogenes thatinduce metastasis in one cell line do not
necessarily do so in another.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#103:1>
The most recent genetical aspect of tumor metastasis is the
identification of the metastasis suppressor gene.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#104:1>
This gene, known as nm 23 ( nm stands for non-metastatic) is
normally involved in non-metastatic activity of the cell but any mutation in
this gene causes loss of function and induces cells to undergo metastasis.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-040#105:1>
As more and more evidence of genetic damages asociated with
cancer cells come to light and their association with biochemical functions
become known, cancer may become more manageable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-040#106:1>
Hope that the day is not too far away when this disorder will join
the ranks of those for which successful cure exists. </p> <*> line above the
