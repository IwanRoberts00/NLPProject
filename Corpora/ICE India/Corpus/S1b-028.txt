<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#1:1:A>
<w> India's </w> <?> too </?> graphic population growth <,> is
like a subterranian <,> under current <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#2:1:A>
Too many of the tensions that are surfacing in Indian society today
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#3:1:A>
But not a chronic ailment <,> that one learns to live with <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#4:1:A>
The issue has ceased to be upfront <,> in the national debate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#5:1:A>
And in fact <,> because unless <,,> this is addressed <,,> uh much
else that we do <,> for our developmental efforts <,,> does not justify <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#6:1:A>
Uh <,> welcome break therefore <,> in <w> today's </w> <mention>
Focus </mention> in the wake of the <mention> World Population Day </mention>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#7:1:A>
That brings together <,> three veterans <,> of the population game
<,> into the studio for a discussion <,> with us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#8:1:A>
Uh we have here today <,> Dr Karan Singh <,,> who <,,> lead the
Indian delegation at the first World Population Conference <,> in nineteen
seventy-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#9:1:A>
And gave the world the major of those <O> one word </O> development
is the best contraceptive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#10:1:A>
Although now I believe he is on record saying <,> that
contraception is a best form of develpoment

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#11:1:A>
But <w> I'm </w> sure <,> you will hear more about <,> that from
him <,> later <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#12:1:A>
Then there is Dr Bose <,,> a Jawaharlal Nehru fellow <,> and <,> an
evergreen <,> <-> of </-> commentator of the population <,> in many other
issues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#13:1:A>
And finally <,> Dr Mathur <,> who is the bureaucrat <,> in the hot
seat <,> as a secretary with the Department <,> of Family Welfare <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#14:1:A>
But first before we <,,> turn the floor over <,> for a free <,>
participation of <,> everybody for a discussion on this issue <,> for the
last one year now <,> a population policy has been on the anvil <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#15:1:A>
The eighth plan <,> which has been approved in May <,> has given
<,> priority to the population issue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#16:1:A>
But at the same time <,> while giving priority <,> it has <,>
down-scaled <,> birth rate target <,> even though one positive scene in all
this dismal <,> scenario has been that of late birth rates are dropping <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#17:1:A>
But <,> the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only
twenty-six <,> for the year nineteen ninety <,> seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#18:1:A>
Why is this happening <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#19:1:A>
Or perhaps <,,> I should stop at this point <,> and ask Dr Karan
Singh <,> who <,,> has <,> spearheaded this programme <,> with very critical
<,> point in the programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#20:1:A>
To give his comment on <,> uh where we are <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#21:1:A>
And where do you think we are going where you see we can go <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#22:1:B>
Well the <,> uh theme we are about <}> <-> discussion </-> <+>
to discuss </+> </}> is uh <,> Population: Whithered India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#23:1:B>
And I have uh <,> two word response to that two word question <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#24:1:B>
And the response is <,> towards disaster <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#25:1:B>
Because uh what has happened in the last forty <}> <-> year </->
<+> years </+> </}> <,,> uh the increase of five hundred million people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#26:1:B>
The population of India from the nineteen fifty-one <,> to the
nineteen ninety-one census <,,> is something which is absolutely staggering
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#27:1:B>
It has diluted to a very large extent <,> the considerable <,> uh
economic development that took place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#28:1:B>
As a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century
<,,> with more people below the poverty line <,,> then when we became free in
nineteen forty-seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#29:1:B>
More people <,> not a larger proportion of the population but in
absolute term more people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#30:1:B>
Our cities are exploding <,,> into slums they are like cancer
growth <,> eating into the countryside <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#31:1:B>
Uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse
<,> under the sheer pressure of number <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#32:1:B>
There is urbanization <,> there is deforestation <,> there is uh
<,> defoliation <,> the environment is being destroyed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#33:1:B>
And I would say <,> that we are in a disastrous situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#34:1:B>
Now <,> what can be done about it ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#35:1:B>
I was very surprise to hear you say that uh <,> <}> <-> a </- > <=>
the </=> </}> population policy is on the anvil <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#36:1:B>
We must have a very hot anvil you know because <,> in nineteen
hundred and seventy-six <,> I presented a national population policy to
parliament <,> which was accepted

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#37:1:B>
Now that is sixteen years ago <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#38:1:B>
If the anvil is still growing <,> I think we should let the
representatives of the government of India <,> enlighten us that what exactly
has <}> <-> happen </-> <+> happened </+> </}> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#39:1:A>
Mr Mathur right

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#40:1:A>
Would you tell us <,> why is it that it is necessary to tell the
working on the population policy ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#41:1:A>
But also I would like you to comment on what <-> is </-> <,> would
you think feasible to be done in the near future <,> within this decade <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#42:1:A>
And what are <,> the strategies that you are forging <,> and are
you getting the support <,> if you think you need <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#43:1:C>
Well while I entirely agree with Dr Karan Singh that <w> it's
</w> a disastrous uh situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#44:1:C>
But <,> whither India <,> well whether we can save the disaster or
not <,> would depend what we do in the next ten years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#45:1:C>
And therefore we have <,> very <,,> uh manfully taken the challenge
<,> uh should say atleast in the <}> <-> <.> de </.> </-> <=> our department
</=> </}> <,> to see <}> <-> how </-> <=> what </=> </}> we can do about it
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#46:1:C>
And in the last one year <,,> first of all <w> we've </w> made <,>
uh concerted efforts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#47:1:C>
Now again <,> focus attention on the population problem through
very close interaction <,,> between <w> India's </w> <O> one word </O> we
have been <,> I think uh <,> instrumental in <,,> uh increasing the awareness
about the whole problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#48:1:C>
We are <,> finding a lot of interest now <,> in ordinary people
also to <,> participate in the whole thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#49:1:C>
Then we have <,,> projected <,> at least don't <?> create </?> <,>
family welfare programme with the population control programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#50:1:C>
When population control is a much larger concept <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#51:1:C>
Family welfare of course <,> is <,> a key aspect of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#52:1:C>
For population control is dependent on female literacy <,>
education <,> rural devepolment <,,> uh age of marriage of girls <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#53:1:C>
So for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#54:1:C>
Now <,> <w> I'm </w> very glad that there was a policy as Dr Karan
Singh has had mentioned earlier a National Population Policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#55:1:C>
But that all had to be <,> uh made into implementation plan and
there had to be a <,> uh micro-level <,> mechanism also to have a
co-ordinated implementation action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#56:1:C>
Now <,,> because of that now the N D C has appointed a committee of
<,> N N D C on population which is going into the whole question on
micro-level co-ordination <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#57:1:C>
And as far as the <,> a family welfare factor is concerned <,> we
have <,> prepared a very result oriented and purpose <O> one word </O> plan
<,> giving emphasis or improving of the quality <,> or the <,> <?> self </?>
family welfare services the health services <,,> constant <O> one word </O>
attention of the urban slums

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#58:1:C>
Dr Karan Singh has <}> <-> spoke </-> <+> spoken </+> </}> about
<,> improving the quality of contraceptive <,> introducing new contraceptive
<,> social marketing <,> better <,> information communication education <.>
na </.> uh <.> ta </.> strategies <,> ivolvement of people <,> N G O

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#59:1:A>
What specific measure <{> <[> that improve endeavoury </[> of
services which is your <O> one or two words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#60:1:C>
<[> That maternal </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#61:1:C>
Uh well <,,> you see on that <,,> a lot of it is going to be
the advent state of input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#62:1:C>
And training will play a key role <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#63:1:C>
Now we have through <,> very close interaction with the state
government <,> particularly the <,> state government from these <,> four mega
states of North <,> U P Bihar <,> Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan <,> and to an
extent Orissa and <,> uh Assam where the problem is uh aggrieving <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#64:1:C>
We have <,> brought home the need for improving the delivering
system

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#65:1:C>
So <,> we are having certain special projects <,> <O> one word </O>
infrastructure <,> great emphasis being made <,> lead on the <,> uh training
programme <,> filling up of portio

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#66:1:C>
These are the nitty gritty details of good administration which
makes all the difference <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#67:1:C>
And then of course <w> we're </w> having very close monitoring what
they do <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#68:1:B>
Yes greater enthusiasm <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#69:1:C>
And then we have got this <,> what you called uh ninety
district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state <,> of which
eighty-three are in the four state <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#70:1:B>
So I have a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#71:1:A>
<O> One word </O> taken up already <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#72:1:C>
Well <,> the beginning have been made

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#73:1:C>
We are awaiting <,> uh the micro-plan from the individual district
<,> because we do not want to impose anything from above <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#74:1:C>
So we have told the State Government <,> <quote> please involve
your local people <,> your collector <,> your uh <,> chief medical officer
</quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#75:1:C>
And they from the local condition <,,> send us micro-plan <,> which
would indicate <,> their special support is required from the Center <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#76:1:C>
So that uh <,> the democracy profile improves in those states <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#77:1:C>
And then of course I <,> I was mentioning <,> a very great emphasis
<,> on maternal and child health area you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#78:1:C>
We are <,> just about to launch <,> a very <,> important <mention>
child survival and safe motherhood project </mention> which <,> uh through an
integrated <,> have been to mention for child survival <,> and for promotion
of <,> safe motherhood practices <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#79:1:C>
It reduce infant mortality <,> child mortality <,> and maternal
mortality <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#80:1:C>
And <,> people will <,> then appreciate that uh <,> if you <,> <}>
<-> your </-> <=> their </=> </}> children are going to survive <,> they need
not have launched up <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#81:1:A>
Ashish <w> I'm </w> <,> wondering what you have to say on all
this

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#82:1:A>
I can <}> <-> <.> al al </.> </-> <=> almost </=> </}> see you it
looks <,> coining a new acronym <,> <{> <[> no no <,> right now

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#83:1:D>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#84:1:D>
I will make two brief comments at the outset <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#85:1:D>
First what Dr Karan <w> Singh's </w> <?> relation </?> to the
National Population Policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#86:1:D>
I think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two <,> to
<,> think of <,> again formulating a national population policy

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#87:1:D>
<w> I've </w> just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen
ninety-one census data <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#88:1:D>
And <,> one thing which emerges <.> gre </.> is a great diversity
of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#89:1:D>
And you can't put all these states and districts <,,> in one
package <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#90:1:D>
And therefore the national population policy tends to be <,> a set
of platitudes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#91:1:D>
And it has very little operational value <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#92:1:D>
In any case <w> we've </w> miss the bus

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#93:1:D>
We should have done it <,> right in the First Five Year Plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#94:1:D>
Now Dr Karan Singh the only snag uh <,> you would forgive me for
saying that only snag about the <,> national population policy formulated by
him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#95:1:D>
Well this was emergency <,> and it became highly unpopular <,>
because there was one permissive clause <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#96:1:D>
I don't remember the particular section <,> or the dialogue <,>
which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory
sterilization then we do so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#97:1:D>
If they have <,> the way <w> they've </w> resolve and that landed
<,> the government in very serious trouble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#98:1:D>
And as you know the very next year the Janata Government withdrew
that policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#99:1:D>
The only thing common <,> in their next <w> year's </w> policy was
<,> this fielding of the <,> electorate <,> the parliamentary assembly seat
in nineteen seventy-one <,> upto two thousand one

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#100:1:D>
That is a very good step <,> I suppose that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#101:1:A>
In fact there was very serious <,> <{> <[> severe setbacks to
the <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#102:1:D>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#103:1:D>
So <w> let's </w> not get back into history

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#104:1:D>
The thing is <,> as we are now if we are still waiting even after
formulating the eighth five year plan <,> for a national population policy
<,> then I think we are lost <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#105:1:D>
And <w> we're </w> heading towards disaster as he say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#106:1:D>
And it is time that we forget this sort of <,> a generalizing <,>
and comes out to grasp that another plan of action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#107:1:D>
Now which brings me <,> my second point <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#108:1:D>
Now there if I mentioned so my differenc to the <w> ministry's
</w> plan of action is <,> those ninety districts which you have identified
<,> they are truely backward <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#109:1:D>
In fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census <,> I get one
hundred and fifteen districts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#110:1:D>
Any other noble mind you told me that you can also change <,> uh
<{> <[> <?> dedicated </?> </[> the act to that resolve

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#111:1:D>
<w> That's </w> not my point

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#112:1:D>
My point is <,> if you put more money on familiy palanning in
those districts <,> you will not succeed <,> because <,> there the birth
rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#113:1:D>
The roads are not there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#114:1:D>
These hospitals are not functioning <,> <w> sub-centre's </w> are
not fuctioning <,> staff is not there

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#115:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#116:1:A>
And there are number of other social indicators are in here
backward <{> <[> whether it being marriage </[> whether it is child labour
whether it is

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#117:1:D>
<[> All the other <O> one or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#118:1:D>
Yeah <,> therefore I would say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#119:1:A>
High maternal mortality

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#120:1:D>
That you should not spread the butterfield <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#121:1:D>
You should not waste your resources <,,> family <w> planning's
</w> limited resources on giving a backup <,> in those districts where the
infra-structure has to be laid first <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#122:1:D>
So in my scheme of things in <}> <-> my </-> <=> my </=> </}>
strategy which <w> I'm </w> going to formulate shortly <,> I would support
the <,> thickly populated densely populated advanced districts <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#123:1:D>
We should give the lead to the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#124:1:D>
For Example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#125:1:D>
<}> <-> <.> I I </.> </-> <=> <w> it's </w> </=> </}> a shame that
<,> in the urban areas the birth rate is so very high <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#126:1:D>
One of the reason of course is the large slum population to which
Dr Karan Singh referred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#127:1:D>
So <,> <{> <[> but uh <,> the strategy of putting your money in a
backward districts for family planning back-up <,,> I really have reserves

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#128:1:A>
<[> But uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#129:1:A>
But why you have a valid point about <,> doing something
about the urban slums definitely need the full pace <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#130:1:A>
But <,> seventy-five percent of India is <-> in </-> still in the
rural areas <,> and within that <,> seventy-five percent of those really
needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with
relation to two thousand population

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#131:1:D>
Yes more settlement

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#132:1:A>
There is uh settlement

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#133:1:D>
Yes yes that makes <{> <[> the </[> task more difficult <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#134:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#135:1:D>
So therefore the ninety district strategy either <O> a few
words </O> <,> we can have <,> little discussion on this

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#136:1:B>
Actually what you feel is that <,> the two things are not
mutually extreme

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#137:1:D>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#138:1:B>
We are focussing on urban slums <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#139:1:B>
We realize that these are also neglected area

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#140:1:B>
And when you <,> if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a
little bit push <,> you can have the results <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#141:1:B>
So <,> city by city <,> we are making a plan <-> to </-> how to
strengthen the infrastructure

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#142:1:B>
We have taken four cities including Delhi <,,> Calcutta <,>
Hyderabad and Bangalore in the first phase <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#143:1:B>
Other uh municipal <,> commissioners and the state <w>
government's </w> have been <,> asked to have their own plans

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#144:1:B>
Because you see unless the <,,> local authorities are involve in
the planning process <,> then they don't own the fact <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#145:1:B>
And then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#146:1:B>
So we are awaiting that and <,> I <?> and yes </?> will <?>
definitely </?> we will cover all the ninety <,> cities in the first phase
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#147:1:B>
But ninety district uh strategies <,> we have to go along
otherwise those districts will be far behind

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-028#148:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> come back on the ninety districts

<O> One or two words </O> can I say something one or two
things I would like to say of this

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#150:1:B>
Firstly <,,> uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be
need <,> and come up to you before you formulate your new policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#151:1:B>
That reminds me of the famous verse by Galib <quote> <indig> hum
ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin <,> khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone
tak </indig> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#152:1:B>
By the time you uh <,> you develop your <O> laughter </O> <O> one
or two words </O> you will see these micro- plan <,> you know the country is
already uh uh <,> virtually drowning in an ocean <,> <}> <-> of of </-> <,>
<=> of </=> </}> people

So <,> my submission would be <,> that there must be a sense of
urgency about it <,>

<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#155:1:B>
It became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry
<,> and mind you the alibis <w> I've </w> been <O> two words </O> I don't
want to get into controversy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#156:1:B>
But just because in one of the eighteen paragraph <,> there was a
mention <,> an enabling mention of the possibility of some state passing <,>
laws which were never pass <,> that is not an alibi <,> for having dished the
entire population policy which included <,> uh contraceptive technology is
included female literacy <,> it included a lot of worthwhile

<ICE-IND:S1B-028#157:1:A>
