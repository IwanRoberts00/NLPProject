<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#4:1>
<bold> Winter </bold> came and went, without so much as a drizzle.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#5:1>
The hillside was brown all summer and the fields were bare.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#6:1>
The old plough that was dragged over the hard ground by <w> Bisnu's
</w> lean oxen made hardly any impression.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#7:1>
Still, Bisnu kept his seeds ready for sowing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#8:1>
A good monsoon, and there would be plenty of maize and rice to see the
family through the next winter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#9:1>
Summer went its scorching way, and a few clouds gathered on the
south-western horizon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#10:1>
<quote> " The monsoon is coming," </quote> announced Bisnu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#11:1>
His sister Puja was at the small stream, washing clothes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#12:1>
<quote> " If it doesn't come soon, the stream will dry up," </quote>
she said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#13:1>
<quote> " See, <w> it's </w> only a trickle this year.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#14:1>
Remember when there were so many different flowers growing here on
the banks of the stream?

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#15:1>
This year there isn't one." </quote> </p> <&>

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#16:1>
This story is to be published shortly as a book entitled <it> Where
Have all the Flowers Gone </it> by Julia MacRae Books, London. </&> <O> <&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#17:1>
<quote> " The winter was dry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#18:1>
It did not even snow," </quote> said Bisnu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#19:1>
<quote> " I cannot remember another winter when there was no
snow," </quote> said his mother.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#20:1>
<quote> " The year your father died, there was so much snow the
villagers could not light his funeral-pyre for hours <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#21:1>
And now there are fires everywhere." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#22:1>
She pointed to the next mountain, half-hidden by the smoke from a
forest fire. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#23:1>
At night they sat outside their small house, watching the fire
spread.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#24:1>
A red line stretched right across the mountain.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#25:1>
Thousands of Himalayan trees were perishing in the flames.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#26:1>
Oaks, <indig> deodars </indig> , maples, pines; trees that had taken
hundreds of years to grow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#27:1>
And now a fire started carelessly by some woodcutters had been
carried up the mountain with the help of the dry grass and a strong breeze.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#28:1>
There was no-one to put it out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#29:1>
It would take days to die down. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#30:1>
</quote> " If the monsoon arrives tomorrow, the fire will go
out," </quote> said Bisnu, ever the optimist.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#31:1>
He was only twelve, but he was the man in the house; he had to see
that there was enough food for the family and for the oxen, for the big black
dog and the hens. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#32:1>
There were clouds the next day but they brought only a drizzle.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#33:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> just the beginning," </quote> said Bisnu
as he placed a bucket of muddy water on the steps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#34:1>
<quote> " It usually starts with a heavy downpour," </quote> said
his mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#35:1>
But there were to be no downpours that year.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#36:1>
Clouds gathered on the horizon but they were white and puffy and soon
disappeared.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#37:1>
True monsoon clouds would have been dark and heavy with moisture.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#38:1>
There were other signs - - or lack of them - - that warned of a long
dry summer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#39:1>
The birds were silent, or simply absent.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#40:1>
The Himalayan barbet, who usually heralded the approach of the
monsoon with strident calls from the top of a spruce tree, hadn't been seen
or heard.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#41:1>
And the cicadas, who played a deafening overture in the oaks at the
first hint of rain, seemed to be missing altogether. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#42:1>
<w> Puja's </w> apricot tree usually gave them a basket full of
fruit every summer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#43:1>
This year it produced barely a handful of apricots, lacking juice and
flavour.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#44:1>
The tree looked ready to die, its leaves curled up in despair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#45:1>
Fortunately there was a store of walnuts, and a binful of wheat-grain
and another of rice stored from the previous year, so they would not be
entirely without food; but it looked as though there would be no fresh fruit
or vegetables.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#46:1>
And there would be nothing to store away for the following winter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#47:1>
Money would be needed to buy supplies in Tehri, some thirty miles
distant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#48:1>
And there was no money to be earned in the village. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#49:1>
<quote> " I will go to Mussoorie and find work," </quote>
announced Bisnu.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#50:1>
<quote> " But Mussoorie is a two-day journey by bus," </quote> said
his mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#51:1>
<quote> " There is no-one there who can help you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#52:1>
And you may not get any work." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#53:1>
<quote> " In Mussoorie there is plenty of work during the summer.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#54:1>
Rich people come up from the plains for their holidays.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#55:1>
It is full of hotels and shops and places where they can spend their
money." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#56:1>
<quote> " But they won't spend any money on <it> you </it> ."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#57:1>
<quote> " There is money to be made there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#58:1>
And if not, I will come home.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#59:1>
I can walk back over the Nag Tibba mountain.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#60:1>
It will take only two and a half days and I will save the bus fare!"
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#61:1>
<quote> " Don't go, <indig> bhai </indig> , " </quote> pleaded
Puja.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#62:1>
<quote> " There will be no-one to prepare your food - - you will only
get sick." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#63:1>
But Bisnu had made up his mind so he put a few belongings in a
cloth shoulder-bag, while his mother prised several rupee-coins out of a
cache in the wall of their living room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#64:1>
Puja prepared a special breakfast of <indig> parathas </indig> and an
egg scrambled with onions, the hen having laid just one for the occasion.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#65:1>
Bisnu put some of the <indig> parathas </indig> in his bag.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#66:1>
Then, waving goodbye to his mother and sister, he set off down the
road from the village. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#67:1>
After walking for a mile, he reached the highway where there was
a hamlet with a bus stop.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#68:1>
A number of villagers were waiting patiently for a bus.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#69:1>
It was an hour late but they were used to that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#70:1>
As long as it arrived safely and got them to their destination, they
would be content.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#71:1>
They were patient people.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#72:1>
And although Bisnu wasn't quite so patient, he too had learnt how to
wait - - for late buses and late monsoons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#73:1>
Along the valley and over the mountains went the little bus with
its load of frail humans. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#74:1>
<quote> " How tiny we are," </quote> thought Bisnu, looking up at
the towering peaks and the immensity of sky.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#75:1>
<quote> " Each of us no more than a raindrop <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#76:1>
And I wish we had a few raindrops!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#77:1>
There were still fires burning to the north but the road went
south, where there were no forests anyway, just bare brown hillsides.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#78:1>
Down near the river there were small paddy fields but <O> <&> page
</&> 8 </O> <O> drawing </O> <O> caption in Hindi </O> <O> <&> page </&> 9
</O> unfortunately rivers ran downhill and not uphill, and there was no
inexpensive way in which the water could be brought up the steep slopes to
the fields that depended on rainfall. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#79:1>
Bisnu stared out of the bus window at the river running far
below.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#80:1>
On either bank huge boulders lay exposed, for the level of the water
had fallen considerably during the past few months. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#81:1>
<quote> " Why are there no trees here?" </quote> he asked aloud,
and received the attention of a fellow passenger, an old man in the next seat
who had been keeping up a relentless dry coughing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#82:1>
Even though it was a warm day, he wore a woollen cap and had an old
muffler wrapped about his neck. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#83:1>
<quote> " There were trees here once," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#84:1>
<quote> " But the contractors took the <indig> deodars </indig> for
furniture and houses.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#85:1>
And the pines were tapped to death for resin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#86:1>
And the oaks were stripped of their leaves to feed the cattle - - you
can still see a few tree-skeletons <}> <-> of </-> <+> if </+> </}> you look
hard - - and the bushes that remained were finished off by the goats!"
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#87:1>
<quote> " When did all this happen?" </quote> asked Bisnu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#88:1>
<quote> " A few years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#89:1>
And <w> it's </w> still happening in other areas, although <w> it's
</w> forbidden now to cut trees.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#90:1>
The only forests that remain are in out of the way places where there
are no roads." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#91:1>
A fit of coughing came over him, but he had found a good listener and
was eager to continue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#92:1>
<quote> " The road helps you and me to get about but it also makes it
easier for others to do mischief.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#93:1>
Rich men from the cities come here and buy up what they want - -
land, trees, people!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#94:1>
<quote> " What takes you to Mussoorie, uncle?" </quote> asked
Bisnu politely.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#95:1>
He always addressed elderly people as uncle or aunt. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#96:1>
<quote> " I have a cough that won't go away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#97:1>
Perhaps they can do something for it at the hospital in Mussoorie.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#98:1>
Doctors don't like coming to villages, you know- <w> there's </w> no
money to be made in villages.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#99:1>
So we must go to the doctors in the towns I had a brother who could
not be cured in Mussoorie.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#100:1>
They told him to go to Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#101:1>
He sold his buffaloes and went to Delhi, but there they told him it
was too late to do anything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#102:1>
He died on the way back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#103:1>
I won't go to Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#104:1>
I don't wish to die amongst strangers." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#105:1>
<quote> " <w> You'll </w> get well, uncle," </quote> said Bisnu.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#106:1>
<quote> " Bless you for saying so.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#107:1>
And you - - what takes you to the big town?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#108:1>
<quote> " Looking for work - - we need money at home." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#109:1>
<quote> " It is always the same.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#110:1>
There are many like you who must go out in search of work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#111:1>
But don't be led astray.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#112:1>
Don't let your friends persuade you to go to Bombay to become a film
star!

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#113:1>
It is better to be hungry in your village than to be hungry on the
streets of Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#114:1>
I had a nephew who went to Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#115:1>
The smugglers put him to work selling <indig> <it> afeem </it>
</indig> - - opium - - and now he is in jail.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#116:1>
Keep away from the big cities, boy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#117:1>
Earn your money and go home." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#118:1>
<quote> " <w> I'll </w> do that, uncle.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#119:1>
My mother and sister will expect me to return before the summer
season is over." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#120:1>
The old man nodded vigorously and began coughing again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#121:1>
Presently he dozed off.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#122:1>
The interior of the bus smelt of tobacco smoke and petrol fumes and
as a result Bisnu had a headache.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#123:1>
He kept his face near the open window to get as much fresh air as
possible, but the dust kept getting into his mouth and eyes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#124:1>
Several dusty hours later the bus got into Mussoorie, honking
its horn furiously at everything in sight.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#125:1>
The passengers, looking dazed, got down and went their different
ways.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#126:1>
The old man trudged off to the hospital. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#127:1>
Bisnu had to start looking for a job straight away.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#128:1>
He needed a lodging for the night and he could not afford the
cheapest of the hotels.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#129:1>
So he went from one shop to another, and to all the little
restaurants and eating-places, asking for work - - anything in exchange for a
bed, a meal, and a minimum wage.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#130:1>
A boy at one of the sweet shops told him there was a job at the
Picture Palace, one of the <w> town's </w> three cinemas.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#131:1>
The hill - - <w> station's </w> main road was crowded with people,
for the season was just starting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#132:1>
Most of them were tourists who had come up from Delhi and other
large towns. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#133:1>
The street lights had come on, and the shops were lighting up,
when Bisnu presented himself at the Picture Palace. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#134:1>
The man who ran the <w> cinema's </w> tea-stall had just sacked
the previous helper for his general clumsiness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#135:1>
Whenever he engaged a new boy ( which was fairly often) he started
him off with the warning: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#136:1>
<quote> " I will be keeping a record of all the cups and plates
you break, and their cost will be deducted from your salary at the end of the
month." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#137:1>
As <w> Bisnu's </w> salary had been fixed at fifty <indig>
rupees </indig> a month, he would have to be very careful if he was going to
receive any of it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#138:1>
<quote> " In my first month," </quote> said Chittru, one of the
three tea-stall boys, <quote> " I broke six cups and five saucers, and my pay
came to three <indig> rupees </indig> !

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#139:1>
Better be careful!" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#140:1>
<w> Bisnu's </w> job was to help prepare the tea and <indig>
samosas </indig> , serve these refreshments to the public during intervals in
the film, and later wash up the dishes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#141:1>
In addition to his salary, he was allowed to drink as much tea as he
wanted or could hold in his stomach. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#142:1>
Bisnu went to work immediately and it was not long before he was
as well-versed in his duties as the other two tea-boys, Chittru and Bali.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#143:1>
Chittru was an easy-going, lazy boy who always tried to place the
brunt of his work on someone <w> else's </w> shoulders.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#144:1>
But he was generous and lent Bisnu five <indig> rupees </indig>
during the first week.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#145:1>
Bali, besides being a tea-boy, had the enviable job of being the
poster-boy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#146:1>
As the cinema was closed during the mornings, Bali would be busy
either in pushing the big poster-board around Mussoorie, or sticking posters
on convenient walls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#147:1>
<quote> " Posters are very useful," </quote> he claimed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#148:1>
<quote> " They prevent old walls from falling down." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#149:1>
Chittru had relatives in Mussoorie and slept at their house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#150:1>
But both Bisnu and Bali were on their own and had to sleep at the
cinema.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#151:1>
After the last show the hall was locked up, so they could not settle
down in the expensive seats as they would have liked!

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#152:1>
They had to sleep in the foyer, near the ticket-office, where they
were often at the mercy of icy Himalayan winds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-019#153:1>
Bali made things more comfortable by setting his poster-board at
an angle to the wall, which gave them a little alcove where they could sleep
protected from the wind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-019#154:1>
As they had only one blanket each, they placed their blankets
together and rolled themselves into a tight warm ball. </p> </I>
