<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#1:1:A>
What I propose to do this morning is to reinforce <,> some of
the points that I made yesterday <,,> and <,> then move on to <,,> two or
three new points <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#2:1:A>
Let me say firmly <,,> and with all the <,,> uhm <,,> with <,> with
the power underlying my perception of teaching in India <,,> that grammar has
a very important role to play <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#3:1:A>
So grammar is not out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#4:1:A>
Don't go back with the impression that grammar is out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#5:1:A>
Grammar is in because as I said yesterday <,,> grammar is the heart
and soul of a human language <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#6:1:A>
No grammar <,> no language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#7:1:A>
Language means grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#8:1:A>
Now the question is that we are teaching and learning English as a
second language <,,> how should we <,,> present the facts of grammar in a
classroom situation <,> to facilitate <,,> the learning of English which
means <,> use of English <,> effectively in a variety of situations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#9:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> not a question that we are not uh sitting here <,>
to say that alright grammar is out now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#10:1:A>
What we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of
presenting the facts of grammar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#11:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> point number <}> <-> <.> o </.> </-> <=> one
</=> </}> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#12:1:A>
Point number two is <,,> that <,,> <w> it's </w> very difficult to
draw a sharp line <,,> between grammar and lexis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#13:1:A>
And therefore in producing our teaching materials <,,> you will
have to have <,,> two types of materials to be highlighted <,,> <&> B B
writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#14:1:A>
And these two types of materials will be <,> sentence-based grammar
<,> and word-based grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#15:1:A>
And one of the excellent <,,> reference books <,,> at the secondary
level is <,> even now that old <w> Palmer's </w> Grammar of English Words
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#16:1:A>
He selected about thousand productive words <,> and he has
presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#17:1:A>
<w> It's </w> an excellent book even now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#18:1:A>
And we are going to do <,> these two <,,> within the over-all
frame-work of <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#19:1:A>
So <,> we are going to organise our materials <,> grammar materials
in two parts <,,> sentence-based grammar and word-based grammar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#20:1:A>
But whether <w> it's </w> sentence-based grammar or word-based
grammar <,> the actual presentation will take place in the context of <,>
discourse of <,,> because the point that I made yesterday <,> we are not
interested in grammar for the sake of grammar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#21:1:A>
We are not interested in rules for the sake of rules <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#22:1:A>
We are interested in <,> making the rules function <,,> making the
rules function <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#23:1:A>
How do we make use of rules <,,> to produce language texts or
discourse materials <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#24:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> second point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#25:1:A>
Uh an example of word-based grammar will be <,,> <&> B B writing
</&> the choice of verb <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#26:1:A>
You have a network of <,> verbs <,,> and then which one to select
<,> in a given context or in a given text <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#27:1:A>
And then the grammar will say <quote> Once you have selected this
<,> then your choice here is <,,> restricted <,,> which will also mean that
<,,> <&> B B writing </&> this will rule out the possibility of <,,>
<mention> A </mention> that clause coming after this <,> whereas if you
select <mention> C </mention> <,,> then you can have <mention> A </mention>
<,> that clause <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#28:1:A>
Third point which I would like to reinforce is <,,> <&> B B writing
</&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#29:1:A>
The <w> learner's </w> mind is that mysterious <,> black box <,>
and our ultimate objective is <,,> language as I said yesterday is a
meaningful human activity <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#30:1:A>
This is the meaning <,> this is the experience <,> this is human
experience <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#31:1:A>
<quote> How do I say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#32:1:A>
What are the possible forms that I should be using to convey this
meaning or this experience </quote> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#33:1:A>
And the whole thing is processed <,> mysteriously <,> by this
learned <,> black box <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#34:1:A>
So once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is
useless <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#35:1:A>
What we are saying is <,,> <quote> Language is a meaningful
activity </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#36:1:A>
So what the learners have to have their focus on is <,> <quote>
This is the meaning <,> this is what I propose to do </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#37:1:A>
Language <w> that's </w> why one of the titles of <w> Halliday's
</w> important book is <,> <mention> Learning How to Mean </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#38:1:A>
This is a very important concept <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#39:1:A>
Second language learning a second language means <,> <quote>
Learning how to mean in a new context of culture </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#40:1:A>
Learning how to mean <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#41:1:A>
How do I mean <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#42:1:A>
I know how to mean in my mother tongue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#43:1:A>
How do I mean in my other tongue which is English <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#44:1:A>
So learning how to mean is <,,> <quote> Learning to categorise
human experiences </quote> you remember the point that I made multilingual
view of the universe <,> bi-focal view of the universe <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#45:1:A>
This is when I have English glasses on <,> this is how the world
appears <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#46:1:A>
When I have my Marathi glasses on this is how <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#47:1:A>
Now I am using English in the Marathi context of culture <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#48:1:A>
How do I use English <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#49:1:A>
Again inspite of all that you keep on saying <,> your students are
going to address you as respected sir <,,> which is not English <,,> but <,,>
<indig> chalta hai </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#50:1:A>
In our context of culture <,,> <w> it's </w> something which is
very important <,> they want to <,,> show their respect for their teachers
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#51:1:A>
So we are moving from <,> meaning to form <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#52:1:A>
<w> It's </w> movement just as yesterday we said <,> we are moving
from fluency to accuracy <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#53:1:A>
Ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#54:1:A>
And once they <,,> start producing texts <,> the text must be
linguistically also accurate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#55:1:A>
But we are not going to <,,> <&> clears throat </&> to put a check
on the fluency right at the beginning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#56:1:A>
We are going to encourage them to play with language <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#57:1:A>
Just as a human child in the context of his L one <,> plays with
language <,> tries out experiments <,> tries out all kinds of tricks <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#58:1:A>
So we will allow a second language learner also <,> to play with
his language <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#59:1:A>
But as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying <,> <quote> Oh
I see <,> what you meant to say is <,,> <quote> Has he come this morning
</quote> </quote> <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#60:1:A>
And things like that

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#61:1:A>
So <,,> what we are doing is <,,> as a result of interaction what
you are doing is <,> exposing him to your <,,> concept of <,,> the standard
variety of this language <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#62:1:A>
So in fact all movements are <,> from dialectal varieties
idiolectal varieties <,> to a frozen standard variety of language for the
time being <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#63:1:A>
So we are moving <,,> from dialect <,> from idiolect to what we
consider at a given point of time to be the standard <,> formal <,> variety
of that language <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#64:1:A>
Then I said <,,> that <,> every teacher of a second language in
fact I will say <,> also of first language <,,> has to have a set of <,,> <&>
B B writing </&> reference tools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#65:1:A>
And the two important tools are <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#66:1:A>
As teachers we must get into the habit of looking up <,,> a
standard reference grammar and looking up <,> something in a standard
dictionary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#67:1:A>
When in doubt <,,> go to <mention> Cobuild </mention> <,,> or
<mention> Longman </mention> <,> or <,,> we have had for years <,> in the
field of E L T <,> <mention> Advanced <w> Learner's </w> English Dictionary
</mention> which we have been using

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#68:1:A>
But we have now better dictionaries <,,> as reference dictionaries
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#69:1:A>
Grammar I said <,,> we need three types or three levels <,,> <&> B
B writing </&> reference grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#70:1:A>
<quote> What do I say is this alright </quote> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#71:1:A>
Now you will find that <,> in all the states in the country today
<,,> newspapers they have I don't know about Maharashtra but <,> down south
<,> <mention> Deccan Herald <mention> Hindu </mention> now <mention> Deccan
Chronicle News Time </mention> they have a column every week <,,> either
<mention> Know Your English </mention> <,> Subramaniam <,,> or <,,> <mention>
Mind Your Language </mention> <,> or <w> Yadurajan's </w> I forget the title
of his series <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#72:1:A>
So there is a big demand <,> is this the right kind of English that
we are using <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#73:1:A>
And this demand is coming from senior I A S officers <,,> senior
executives <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#74:1:A>
<quote> Am I really right <,,> the way I am writing the way I am
drafting </quote> <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#75:1:A>
So there is a big demand for grammar <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#76:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not true that there is no demand for grammar and <w>
it's </w> not at the <w> learner's </w> level <,> <w> it's </w> at fairly
advanced level <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#77:1:A>
People feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of
language <,> then they must be accurate <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#78:1:A>
So accuracy comes at that level <,> after you have <,> started
handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel
that it must be <,,> grammatically accurate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#79:1:A>
Of course there is nothing like one standard form there are
varieties of standard forms also <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#80:1:A>
Then we have <w> teacher's </w> grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#81:1:A>
Now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a <w>
linguist's </w> grammar <,> a linguistically oriented description of a
language <,> and <,> for example I will treat <,,> Quirk <,> Greenbaum <,>
and Svadvik <,> <mention> A comprehensive reference grammar of modern English
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#82:1:A>
Because what they have done is <,,> they have captured the insights
from Transformational Grammar <,> <w> Chomsky's </w> Generative Grammar <,>
<w> Halliday's </w> Systemic Grammar <,> <w> Filmore's </w> Case Grammar <,>
Traditional Grammar and then put them together <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#83:1:A>
So it becomes an exhaustive <,> comprehensive description of
contemporary English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#84:1:A>
<w> Teacher's </w> grammar <,> at different levels for teachers we
have to have different levels of grammar <,> which the teachers will need
<,,> in order to teach <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#85:1:A>
<w> Learner's </w> grammar will have minimal of technical terms <,>
and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#86:1:A>
I will give you an example in a minute <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#87:1:A>
For example <,,> <&> B B writing </&> we set an exercise on <w>
Ramu's </w> routine activities every morning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#88:1:A>
The focus is on every morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#89:1:A>
What does he do every morning <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#90:1:A>
Now see <,,> our emphasis is on <,,> every morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#91:1:A>
A person <,> who does something <,,> every morning <,> as a matter
of habit <,> habitually <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#92:1:A>
So although we are not saying that what we are going to have in
this text is <,,> simple or habitual present <,> but we are highlighting that
indirectly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#93:1:A>
Because our main thing is <,,> characteristic activities of this
person every morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#94:1:A>
What he does every morning <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#95:1:A>
So he gets out of bed <,> at six every morning <,> he brushes his
teeth <,> and so on so on so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#96:1:A>
And then at end <,,> we have a box item <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#97:1:A>
After they have practised language <,,> you have a box item and
this box item is for <,> generalization in the form of grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#98:1:A>
And we say <,> this is what in grammar is called the simple present
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#99:1:A>
And you underline the simple present <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#100:1:A>
So we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the
simple present <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#101:1:A>
We are saying that there are certain things activities which a
human being does <,> habitually repeatatively again and again <,> regularly
<,> and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have
<,> the simple present as a box item <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#102:1:A>
In fact this mechanism of box item was used by <,,> I forget <,>
the name of that American linguist uh <?> Felix </?> <,,> it will come back
<,> to my mind later <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#103:1:B>
Lado

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#104:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#105:1:B>
Fries and Lados

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#106:1:A>
No no not Fries and Lado they you we had <,> <mention> Rapid
Review of English Grammar </mention> we have ten or twelve copies <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#107:1:C>
Prininska sir Prininska

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#108:1:A>
Prininska Prininska <,> yes <,> Prininska

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#109:1:D>
<?> Trusty </?> matter <w> that's </w> all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#110:1:A>
Ah ha yeah <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#111:1:D>
Some Prininska

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#112:1:A>
<indig> Haan haan </indig> yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#113:1:C>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-034#114:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> take <}> <-> <.> anothe </.> </-> <=> another
</=> </}> example <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#115:1:A>
The passive <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#116:1:A>
Even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#117:1:A>
Right at the beginning <,,> there should be <,,> uh some kind of
<,,> some instructions <,> built into the text <,> which the teacher is
supposed to follow <,> in teaching <,> presenting <,> that particular lesson
or that particular <,,> text item <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#118:1:A>
For the teacher <w> it's </w> very important for him to know that
<,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#119:1:A>
This is the formal representation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#120:1:A>
If <w> it's </w> not there then <w> it's </w> not <,,> <-> be </->
passive

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#121:1:A>
It may be some other kind of passive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#122:1:A>
So the teacher must be familiar with this <,,> that the real form
of the passive will be a choice of <,,> a form of the verb to be followed by
<,,> the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle
form <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#123:1:A>
<w> That's </w> one thing <,> that the teacher must know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#124:1:A>
Second thing that the teacher must know is <,,> <w> it's </w> a
<,> mechanism a linguistic mechanism a language mechanism <,> for promoting
the object and demoting the subject <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#125:1:A>
But this is for the teacher <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#126:1:A>
What are the situations that are <,> that may necessitate the use
of the passive <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#127:1:A>
The situational factors are <,,> that we are either not interested
in the agent in the doer <,,> or that the doer is unknown <,> or that the
doer <,> doesn't need any mention <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#128:1:A>
Then the sufferer <,> the affected <,> the receiver <,> comes to
the front <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#129:1:A>
This is subject position <,> and the verb has a marked feature
<,,> be plus <,> in <,> past participle <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#130:1:A>
So the teacher must know <,,> that the use of the passive is
context governed use <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#131:1:A>
<w> It's </w> the context <,> that gives you a clue to the use of
the passive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#132:1:A>
And if you look at <,,> your text <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#133:1:A>
You see Blood Transfusion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#134:1:A>
Now this is a kind of text <,> which belongs to the register of
science <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#135:1:A>
And in the register of science unless it is biographical or
autobiographical <,> the doer is not so important <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#136:1:A>
<w> It's </w> the action that is important <,> <w> it's </w> the
activity <w> that's </w> important <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#137:1:A>
<w> It's </w> the thing done <w> that's </w> important

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#138:1:A>
So I have marked on the first two pages at least ten <,,> examples
of the passive <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#139:1:A>
Where they say <,> now this is done every day with good results
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#140:1:A>
Uh very little can be done now about this because it has already
been done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#141:1:A>
Change may be caused if you do this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#142:1:A>
A soldier may be brought in and put to bed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#143:1:A>
A <w> man's </w> blood was changed <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#144:1:A>
Man could be put into <,> something something something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#145:1:A>
These were the things which were asked <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#146:1:A>
This <,,> was tried out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#147:1:A>
It was done and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-034#148:1:A>
So on the first two pages I find <,,> that the focus is on
activity on the action done <,> on the <,> thing achieved rather than on the
agent or the doer <,,> </I>
