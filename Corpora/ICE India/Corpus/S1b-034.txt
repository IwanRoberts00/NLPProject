<ICE-IND:S1B-034#1:1:A>
As most of you must be aware <,> parliament conveyance tomorrow
<,,> for its first session in the new year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#2:1:A>
It will be a very important session <,> not only because it will be
a fairly long one <,,> stretching right into <,> the middle of May <,> but
also because <,,> because it will be the budget session <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#3:1:A>
And the most crucial among all the Parliament Sessions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#4:1:A>
The railway budget <,> and the annual general budget <,> will be
presented during the session <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#5:1:A>
There was a time <,> when the budgets <,> were just <,> mere fiscal
exercises <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#6:1:A>
Exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#7:1:A>
But those days seem <,,> far away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#8:1:A>
The present day trend is <,> that the budgets are regarded <,> as
<,,> very strong and major indicators <,,> of the governments political
ideology <,,> and its approach <,> to the economic problems <,,> of the
country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#9:1:A>
It has almost become a fashion with us <,> media people <,,> to
predict <,> that every session of Parliament <,> will be a stormy one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#10:1:A>
Well looking uh <,,> into the <,,> issues <,,> that have been <,,>
figuring in the newspapers <,,> there is enough of the element of controversy
<,,> in them <,> to make this coming session of Parliament <,,> perhaps a
really <,> stormy one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#11:1:A>
It has been my experience <,> that <,,> although several issues
<,,> are identified as likely to dominate <,> uh Parliament sessions <,>
invariably it so happens <,,> that <,> some other issues <,,> come in <,> and
take not only the parliamentarians <,> but also the people by surprise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#12:1:A>
But this time to my mind <&> cough </&> the issues are fairly <,,>
clear <,> because <,,> I expect at least <,,> uh the <,,> issue <,,> to
dominate <,,> the current session of Parliament will be mostly <,> economic
<,,> in nature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#13:1:A>
To identify some of the issues and to <,,> discuss them and analyse
them <,,> with me tonight <,> around this table <,> you will see Sukharamjee
<,,> and Murali Bhandarijee of the <mention> Congress-I </mention> <,> on my
left <,,> <indig> Shrimati </indig> Sushama Swaraj of the <mention> Bharatiya
Janata Party </mention> <,,> and <indig> Shri </indig> Gurupadswamy of the
<mention> Janata Dal </mention> <,> and <indig> Shri </indig> Somanath
Chatterejee <,> of the <mention> CPM </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#14:1:A>
You might have <,,> uh read in the <,> papers that the <,>
<mention> National Front </mention> and the <mention> Left Front </mention>
parties <,,> have decided to boycott <,,> the Address of the President to the
joint session <,> of the two houses tomorrow morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#15:1:A>
Uh before <,> uh we really begin to discuss the issues I would like
uh <,,> the representatives of the two parties with us here today <,,> to
enlighten us on the <,> logic and rationale of this very <,> very drastic
step <,,> of uh <,> deciding to boycott <,> the <w> President's </w> Address
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#16:1:A>
Somanath would you like to begin <{> <[> set </[> the ball rolling

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#17:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#18:1:B>
Yes I want to make it clear at the beginning that <,,> our
decision to boycott the session is <}> <-> not any </-> <,> <=> not a </=>
</}> reflection on the President personally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#19:1:B>
We have high respect for him as a <,,> as a person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#20:1:B>
But we feel that the <,> <w> President's </w> joint address <,>
address to the joint session as uh <,> even the Constitution <,,> uh provide
for <,> is not meant to be a ritual <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#21:1:B>
And the President is expected to announce the <w> government's </w>
policies <,> economic policies primarily as well as other policies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#22:1:B>
But so far as this government is concerned during <-> in </-> the
inter-session period <,,> they have taken <,> very important decisions on
matters <,> affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this
country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#23:1:B>
And <,> all those decisions have been taken without <,,> taking the
Parliament into the <}> <-> <.> con </.> uh </-> <=> confidence </=> </}> <,>
bypassing the Parliamnet behind the back of the Parliament therefore we said
<,,> just to go and listen to what has already taken place <,,> will be a
mere formality because the Parliament has been <,,> has been reduced to
irrelevence

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#24:1:B>
And this speech all this <,> address to joint session will serve no
purpose <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#25:1:B>
Therefore to register our protest <,> to the <w> governemnt's </w>
way of functioning <,,> and taking the Parliament for <-> the </-> granted
<,> ignoring the Parliament in vital issues <,> we felt that we should
register <,> our protest in a more and a very democratic manner <,> without
showing any disrespect to the <w> President's </w> personell

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#26:1:A>
Murali would you <,> agree with this point of view or would
you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little <,> uh little
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#27:1:C>
Well I think they are fulfilling their role eminently

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#28:1:A>
Yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#29:1:C>
That is to oppose <,> oppose <,> and oppose

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#30:1:C>
But propose nothing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#31:1:C>
There is no logic in this at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#32:1:C>
Because firstly <,> in the last budget which was <-> only </-> in
the month of July <,> the whole policy <,> was unfolded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#33:1:C>
Steps were taken to implement that policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#34:1:C>
There have been very important lengthy discussions <,> on all
aspects <,> whether it is the industrial policy <,> whether it is devaluation
<,> whether it is free market economy <,> whether it is the entry of the
multinationals <,> whether it is the export policy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#35:1:C>
We have had extensive debates <,> not only in the last budget
session <,> but also in the winter session <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#36:1:C>
Now I cannot understand <,> their saying that all this has been
implemented behind the back of the Parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#37:1:C>
I think they are merely finding an excuse <,> because they are
today <,,> without any substantial issue <,> in the Parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#38:1:C>
<{> <[> I </[> think <,> they are also conscious <,,> that after
the Punjab election <,> and particularly if I may <,> take the events of the
<,> just last four weeks <,> the excellent <,> manner in which <,>
particularly the Prime Minister <,> P V Narsimha Rao has held the whole
situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#39:1:C>
Look at the <,> unfurling of the <,,> National Flag <,> on the
twenty-sixth of January <,> ending in the fiasco of the <indig> ekta <,> ekta
yatra </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#40:1:C>
The determine manner in which we repelled <,,> any crossing into
Kashmir <,> on the eleventh of February <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#41:1:C>
The way in <,> in which we have <}> <-> <.> bro </.> </-> <=>
brought </=> </}> democracy <,> back on the race <,> in Punjab <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#42:1:C>
And in the process we have achieved a position <,> where there is
little threat <,> to the survival of the government

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#43:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#44:1:A>
Well Murali you have begun already talking about the
achievements of the government

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#45:1:A>
Where as I thought first we will identify the <,> issues that are
likely to come up

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#46:1:A>
What Sukharamjee <,> in view of your party <,> are the main issues
<,> that are likely to come up ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#47:1:A>
Or what do you expect <,> the <,> major thrust to be on <,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#48:1:D>
<indig> Mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle
</indig> Parliament <indig> mei ayenge <,> ek to arthik </indig> <,> economic
issue <,> <indig> aur doosre </indig> <,,> defence of country <,,> <indig>
aur teesre </indig> <,,> socio- political issues <,,> <indig> jaise Jharkand
hai <,> Jammu Kashmir hai doosre hain <,> magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab
se jyade <,> jo </indig> debate <indig> ya </indig> <,> Parliament <indig>
mei <,> jo uhm jyada samay lagega woh </indig> economic issues <indig> ke
upar hai <,> abhi jaise aap ko malum hai sare desh ko malum hai <,> ke jab is
</indig> government <indig> ne karyabhar sambhala <,> to hamare </indig> <O>
one word </O> position <indig> kya thi <,> mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte
se kum ka <,> hamare pas ayat ka woh </indig> foreign exchange <indig> tha
<,> aur uh phir </indig> external <,> <indig> hamare pas jo </indig> foreign
loan <indig> ka tha ek <,> uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi
<,> to is baat se <,> bade kuch </indig> harsh step <indig> lene pade waise
<,> sare sansar mei itne </indig> democracys <indig> hain <,> usme hamesha
</indig> democratic government <indig> jo hai woh sakht </indig> options <,>
opt <indig> karti hain <,> magar is sarkar ke samne </indig> hard options
<indig> ke siway koi uh <,> chara nahi tha <,> is baat se ye jyada taur par
</indig> financial problem <indig> jo hain yeh </indig> dominate <indig>
karengi yeh </indig> debates <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#49:1:A>
Gurupadswamy do you <,,> uh share this view that <,> uh the
<,> government had no option <,,> but to go in for hard decisions <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#50:1:A>
And the hard decisions taken <,> have let to a kind of a reforming
of this <,> economic structure <,> which in the <,> view of the opposition
<,> has not been on right lines <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#51:1:E>
See let me <,,> uh answer your first question

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#52:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#53:1:E>
Why <mention> National Front </mention> <,,> and <mention>
Left Front </mention> have <,> decided to boycott <,,> the <w> President's
</w> Address <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#54:1:E>
You <,,> appreciate <,,> for last twenty years <,,> at no time <,,>
so many important <,> decisions have been taken <,,> without reference to
Parliament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#55:1:E>
My friend Bhandarajee <,,> said <,> many of the issues <,> have
been already discussed in Parliament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#56:1:E>
Discussion on difference <,> of issues is one thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#57:1:E>
Many issues are discussed in Parliament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#58:1:E>
But <,,> I am talking of <,,> issues where <,> the government takes
decisions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#59:1:E>
I do not find in the annals of Parliament <,,> so many important
and vital decisions have been taken <,,> without the approval of Parliament
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#60:1:A>
Gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such <,> decisions
<,> when you are making a distinction between <,> a policy implementation and
a decision <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#61:1:E>
<w> You'll </w> <w> you'll </w> <,> uh <w> you'll </w> see <,>
you will know that <,,> uh functions <,,> the <,,> agreement that has been
reached <,> on various issues in the <mention> International Monitory Fund
</mention> and <mention> World Bank </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#62:1:E>
Duncan proposals <,,> and <,,> <O> one word </O> intellectual
property rights <,> and so on

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#63:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#64:1:E>
They have not been thoroughly discussed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#65:1:E>
And <,> approval of Parliament has not been obtained <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#66:1:E>
Their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#67:1:E>
So after a good deal of thought <,,> we <,,> came to this
conclusion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#68:1:E>
And uh <,,> I just say that <,> <w> President's </w> Address is a
very important occasion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#69:1:E>
A unique event <,> which comes once in <,,> every year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#70:1:E>
And the President has to <,,> tell Parliament tell the country <,,>
the present <,,> situation <,,> shoud also say <,,> what agenda will be taken
up <,> by government <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#71:1:E>
What are the issues <,,> on which decisions are taken <,> by the
government <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#72:1:E>
So I do not want <,,> the address be a <,,> a dreary affair <,> a
dull affair a ritualistic affair <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#73:1:E>
It should be it should be a very important <,> document <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#74:1:E>
And I think that <O> one word </O> has been destroyed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#75:1:A>
Well <mention> Bharatiya Janata Party </mention> is the major
opposition in the <indig> Lok Sabha </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#76:1:A>
And <,,> the <mention> BJP </mention> as you see has not <,> shared
the perception of the <mention> National Front </mention> Parties and the
<mention> Left Front </mention> Parties <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#77:1:A>
And they <,> <+> are </+> not boycotting the <w> President's </w>
Address <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#78:1:A>
Does this mean <,> Sushmajee that <,> <mention> BJP </mention> is
<,> more or less <,> in agreement with the Congress <w> government's </w> <,>
economic policies <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#79:1:A>
Or is it because they think it is <,> not wise <,> to announce a
boycott ?

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#80:1:F>
<X> <&> In Hindi </&> </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#81:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig> <,> Murali <,> do you <,,> agree with
this conclusion that the rise in prices <,> and the growing <,> growing graph
of unemployment <,> is a logical corollary <,,> of the structural reforms
that you have carried out <,> in the party in the last one year <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#82:1:A>
And secondly <,> that uh <,,> Parliament <,,> could have <,,> given
its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on
them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#83:1:A>
Their complaint basically is that <,> the government has
unilaterally more or less <,> gone ahead with very very vital decisions in
the economic field <,> even though you had acquainted them with the broad
orientation <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#84:1:C>
Well I won't agree with <{> <[> that </[> because <,,> I think
the most important issue <,,> is the price rise <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#85:1:C>
Because inflation <,,> is the cruelest form of taxation on the
poorest <,,> of our people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#86:1:C>
And no government can afford to impose that taxation <,> on our
people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#87:1:C>
I think my party as well as <,,> my <w> party's </w> government
<,,> is conscious of this fact <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#88:1:C>
Undoubtedly we were placed <,> in a as it has been explain by my
<,> colleague Sukharamjee <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#89:1:C>
We were placed <,> in a position where <,> we had to do certain
thing not <,,> uh willingly in a sense <,> that <,,> we had to <,> take very
hard options <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#90:1:C>
We didn't choose <,> soft options <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#91:1:C>
All of us had predicted <,> including the treasury benches

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#92:1:C>
They had predicted that the budget would <,> result in price rise
<,> and the inflation has to be controlled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#93:1:C>
So I do not think that something new has happened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#94:1:C>
<w> Everybody's </w> expectations <,> in this case unfortunately
have been <,> found to be true <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#95:1:C>
Therefore that is one thing

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#96:1:C>
I don't think <,> whatever has been done by the government is a
sequence <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#97:1:C>
Now taking what <,> my friend Gurupadswamy says <,,> for example on
the Duncal proposal <,> we have set up a high powered committee under the
chairmanship of Arjun Singhjee <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#98:1:C>
And he had <,> been <}> <- > have been </-> <+> having </+> </}>
talks with all sections <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#99:1:C>
All the leaders of the opposition parties <,> all sections of the
society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#100:1:C>
And no decision has yet been taken <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#101:1:C>
I think these are all the excuses

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#102:1:C>
One must <,> in a democracy <,> not anticipate <,> that the <,>
Presidential Speech will be lacklustre or without substance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#103:1:C>
It will be full of substance

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#104:1:C>
There will be a motion of <O> two words </O> <,> and the motion of
thank would be voted upon <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#105:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#106:1:A>
That is true

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#107:1:A>
That is the convention <,> usually

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#108:1:A>
But Murali you made uh <,> one or two points <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#109:1:A>
The first point is that <,> uh there was a <,> uh in the <,>
system itself there was an inbuilt <,> provision <,> or compulsion for the
rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#110:1:A>
But you must remember <,> this government came into being <,> on
the basis of a manifesto which had promised <,> that prices will be rolled
back to the July <,> uh nineteen ninety level

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#111:1:A>
That has not happened <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#112:1:A>
On the contrary the criticism of the opposition <,> as I see it is
that the country <,> does not only have inflation but it is also <,> beset by
<O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#113:1:A>
Now Somanath <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> your party <,> uh has had <,> uh
serious objections if I remember <,> to the very idea of approaching the
<mention> IMF </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#114:1:A>
And all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind
of conditionalities which the <mention> IMF </mention> <,> uh imposed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#115:1:A>
Now the claim of the Finaince Minister has been that the <,,> the
benifits of this <,> reforms that have been introduce will be felt <-> in the
</-> <,> only in the next three years and not before <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#116:1:A>
Meanwhile prices are going up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#117:1:A>
What is the perception of the opposition <,> to this situation <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#118:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#119:1:B>
You see <,> all our apprehensions have proved to be correct
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#120:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-034#121:1:B>
Unfortunately in the sense <,,> that the common people are
suffering <,> because of the policies of this government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#122:1:B>
It is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices
will rise there will be inflation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#123:1:B>
But what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of
the <-> people </-> common people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#124:1:B>
We have been <,> uh stressing on <,> strengthening the public
distribution system <,,> making um essential commodities available to the
common people at a vulnerable sections of the society <,> at a <,> a
reasonable price <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#125:1:B>
But instead of doing that we have had to find during the
inter-session the government has increased <,,> the administered price of the
commodities <,> namely rice <,> wheat etcetera <,> which are distributed
through public distribution system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#126:1:B>
Therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to
contain the price rise <,> is <,,> well I think fuel to the fire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#127:1:B>
Why administered price increased <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#128:1:B>
Now <,,> this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because
of so called structure and reform <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#129:1:B>
We by structure and reform I mean <,> we find that there is a
complete surrender to the <mention> IMF </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-034#130:1:B>
