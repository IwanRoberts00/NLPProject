<ICE-IND:W2A-007#3:1>
WHATEVER final resting place is accorded to E.M. Forster in the
history of the British novel, he will always occupy a rather unique position
in the development of Anglo-Indian fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#4:1>
It has been suggested <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> that Indian fiction
written in English ( or <quote> ` Indo-Anglian' </quote> fiction, as it used
to be called; since then, <quote> ` Indian English' </quote> fiction) must
have had at the back of its growth the inspiration of <w> Forster's </w>
famous novel on India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#5:1>
More important than the connection between Forster and the growing
Indian practice of writing novels in English is the fact that it was <it>
<mention> A Passage to India </mention> </it> ( 1924) which summed up and at
the same time gave long life to the tradition of Anglo-Indian fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#6:1>
This longevity embraced not only the novels that have come after but
also those which preceded it because <w> Forster's </w> novel enables us to
look both ways and find links that were waiting to be <quote> ` only
connected' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#7:1>
Before proceeding, let us clarify what is meant by <quote> `
AngloIndian fiction' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#8:1>
Bhupal Singh suggested three possibilities: <quote> " Broadly speaking
it includes any novel dealing with India which is written in English, it
means fiction mainly describing the life of Englishmen in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#9:1>
In a still narrower sense it may be taken to mean novels dealing with
the life of Eurasians, who now prefer to be called Anglo-Indians." </quote>
<fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#10:1>
Half a century later the first of these specifications will serve our
purpose best, once we have qualified it by the condition that the authors of
such novels must necessarily be non-Indians.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#11:1>
It is a tradition in the sense it has endured for many years now
<fnr> <sp> * </sp> </fnr> , has generated <O> <&> page </&> 19 </O>
demonstrable inter-action between authors as well as between books, and has
periodically renewed itself opening up new possibilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#12:1>
It is on this third issue that Forster is so important for
AngloIndian fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#13:1>
<it> <mention> A passage to India </mention> </it> is the first clear
intimation in literature of the mortality of British rule in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#14:1>
That intimation released all intelligent aftercomers to the
tradition from the obligation of having to justify the ways of British India
to the English-reading world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#15:1>
These aftercomers were thus freed to explore and interpret other
aspects of Indo-British relations, and thereby gave the tradition extension
in time far beyond the formal termination of the British empire in India.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#16:1>
Also, given the above-mentioned definition, the tradition has always
been open to any English-writing foreigner - - Americans <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp>
</fnr> Australian,<fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> Canadian <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp>
</fnr> and the like - - who encountered India and subsequently transcribed
this experience in fiction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#17:1>
The 1974 reprint of Bhupal <w> Singh's </w> <it> <mention> A
Survey of Anglo-Indian Fiction </mention> </it> carries an anonymous foreword
wherein it is stated <quote> " Anglo-Indian fiction came to an end when the
British withdrew from India" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#18:1>
The definition that has been accepted above refutes this statement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#19:1>
The British may have withdrawn from India in 1974 but interest in
British India continues to prosper <O> <&> page </&> 20 </O> in fiction,
cinema and in television serials based on novels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#20:1>
We may note in this connection that while Anglo-Indian fiction has
ensured a long run for itself by outliving its original impulses, other
European nations that had engaged in colonial ventures in modern times did
not produce related literature of such long standing and large bulk as
Britain did.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#21:1>
Hugh Ridley has, in <quote> " drawing the attention of
English-speaking readers to the colonial fiction of France and Germany, <+> "
</+> </quote> <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> shown how different the literary
outcomes of such impulses were in these two countries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#22:1>
The French, for example, pioneered stories of travel to exotic lands
and the experience of living there - - the earliest example being Bernardin
de St. <w> pierre's </w> <it> <foreign> <mention> Paul et Virginie </mention>
</foreign> </it> ( 1786) - - but this trend gradually developed into a
device for demonstrating, by contrast, the deficiencies of European
civilization. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#23:1>
Germany, on the other hand, possessed no colonial territory
throughout the nineteenth century and chose North or South America - -
continents to which Germans had migrated during that century - - as the
desirable alternative to whatever was unsatisfactory in the homeland. <fnr>
<sp> 8 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#24:1>
When Germany acquired colonies during the period 1890-1914, German
colonial fiction began to take up and defend the imperial cause, but <w>
Germany's </w> experience, as a colonial power was not long enough or did not
stir the <w> writer's </w> imagination adequately to generate a fictional
tradition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#25:1>
The French underwent a much longer and varied experience, in
Africa and South-east Asia - - also in tiny conclaves on the Indian
sub-continent - hence the volume of French literature relating to its
colonies is proportionately larger, and theorists like Roland Lebel and
Eugene Pujarniscle have held <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> that colonial fiction
had developed as a distinct genre.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#26:1>
However, subsequent to the dismantling of colonial systems that
has happened in the second half of the twentieth century, the outlook on this
aspect of <O> <&> page </&> 21 </O> French literature has also undergone
drastic revision.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#27:1>
Alec Hargreaves gives expression to such revision when, in the
epilogue of his study of French colonial fiction he states: <&> second
margin begin </&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#28:1>
By their adoption of their former <w> conquerors' </w> language the
works of contemporary francophone writers in Africa and elsewhere certainly
bear witness to the impact of alien rule on the cultures of colonised
peoples.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#29:1>
The colonial experiences seems to have had comparatively little
effect on the artistic traditions of their conquerors. <fnr> <sp> 10 </sp>
</fnr> </p> <&> second margin end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#30:1>
This conclusion would be broadly true of the Indo-British
relationship, but Anglo-Indian fiction has not always shared concerns of
French or German colonial fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#31:1>
As for Indians who do not write in English, they owe little or
nothing to Meadows Taylor or Kipling or E. M Forster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#32:1>
Imaginative literature related to their colonies has been
produced by only a few European nations and even for them it occupies a
temporary phase in their literary history.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#33:1>
But the nature and timing of these literary works, especially the
novels were such that literary historians and critics have from time to time
sought to place them inside some wider phenomenon.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#34:1>
In an early such attempt, Susanne Howe studied mainly nineteenth
century works of colonial fiction in English, French and German, and found
that they generally acted as flag-bearers of the idea of empire: <quote> "
The novelists took the institution of empire itself, along with the
multiplicity of people and situations that it so prodigally furnished forth,
completely for granted." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#35:1>
But when she looked at the twentieth century - - and specially at
some English novels about India - - she decided that on the whole the authors
could be divided into three classes: <quote> " the Defenders, the Doubters,
and the Attackers" </quote> . <fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#36:1>
A much wider variety of responses to the imperial situation was
discerned by Alan Sandison when he chose to examine the work of some <O> <&>
page </&> 22 </O> late Victorian novelists and short story writers like Rider
Haggard, Kipling, Conrad and John Buchan.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#37:1>
They all wrote in English but none was exclusively a writer of
colonial fiction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#38:1>
When they did write stories with colonial settings, elements other
than those relating to imperial ideology was never by itself a source of
inspiration to these writers: <quote> " To see it as such would be to accord
to the imperial idea a creative role in literature which it never
possessed in history." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 13 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#39:1>
Later in the book he insists that not even <w> Kipling's </w> work
had the imperial idea as its basic inspiration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#40:1>
More than the other authors discussed here Kipling was keenly aware
of the separation between the rulers and the ruled inevitable in the colonial
situation; the separation could also be seen as one between man and nature
when the European intruder could not come to terms with <w> India's </w>
climate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#41:1>
Sandison concludes: <quote> " Awareness of <w> man's </w>
estrangement and his compulsive need to armour himself against its
effects, creates the dramatic tension in Kipling." </quote> <fnr> <sp> 14
</sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#42:1>
Steadfast in his admiration of Kipling, Sandison suggests that <w>
Kipling's </w> success was a matter of his being able to use the idea of
empire as a means of conveying his own artistic vision. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#43:1>
By choosing a different set of writers - - also, writers who are
more important than <w> Sandison's </w> set as authors - - who wrote of the
colonial experience, Jeffrey Meyers is able to construct a sequence that ran
parallel to the rise and fall of western colonialism: <&> second margin begin
</&>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#44:1>
The colonial genre is virtually invented and introduced into English
literature by Kipling in the 1880s, at the apogee of the ` scramble for
Africa' is improved upon by Conrad, reaches its peak in <it> <mention> A
Passage to India </it> , </mention> and is continued by [ Joyce ] Carey
and [ Graham ] Greene, who are influenced by Forster and Conrad. <fnr> <sp>
15 </sp> </fnr> <&> second margin end </&> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-007#45:1>
While we may not agree that the <quote> ` colonial genre'
</quote> was innovated as late as the 1880s, Meyers has suggested a most
conveniently <O> <&> page </&> 23 </O> inclusive framework.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#46:1>
In planning to run the writing of these novels alongside the history
of western colonialism, Meyers has had to find the genre declining when the
British Empire began to disintegrate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#47:1>
Yet, when he found place in this scheme for Greene, he had
unwillingly conceded that this genre, like Anglo-Indian fiction proper, was
capable of indefinite extension.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#48:1>
Practically the same combination of authors except Greene, who is
replaced by D. H. Lawrence - - is used by D.C.A.R. Goonetilleke to discuss
not colonial fiction but how, between the 1880s and 1939, some developing
countries in South and South-east Asia, Central and South America, and Africa
were portrayed in British fiction. <fnr> <sp> 16 </sp> </fnr>

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#49:1>
This critic is not interested as such in studying imperialism in
action, but, except for <w> Lawrence's </w> Mexico in <it> <mention> The
Plumed Serpent </mention> </it> ( 1926 ) , all the texts discussed by him
relate to imperial milieu and all the authors - - again excepting Lawrence -
- had first-hand work experience in these developing countries serving the
imperial system.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#50:1>
While imperialism may have created the conditions which stimulated
the creation of these literary works, Goonetilleke finds the works very
different from each other and in no way subject to any condition that
determines how western writers of this period wrote about non-western people.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#51:1>
Also, he is careful to note errors of perception committed by these
writers; he claims to know better because he is an Asian.

<ICE-IND:W2A-007#52:1>
As he remarks tellingly in the chapter on Kipling and Forster,
<quote> " It did not occur to me that the East could be considered <quote> `
mysterious' </quote> until I read Western writings about it." </quote>
