<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-059#1:1:A>
Sir at the outset <,,> I wish to <,,> bring to the attention of
this house <,,> the dignity <,,> of the two institutions <,,> the institution
<,,> of <indig> Rashtrapati </indig> <,,> and the institution the Governor of
the state

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#2:1:A>
Sir <indig> <w> Rashtrapati's </w> </indig> address <,,> is an
address <,,> of the policy of the government that it will follow <,,> and
also <,,> the achievements of the government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#3:1:A>
Sir <,,> political <,,> and <,,> economic stability <,,> are the two
sides of the same coin <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#4:1:A>
We cannot <?> for one </?> <,,> without the other <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#5:1:A>
Sir this government <,,> which came to power <,,> two and a half
years back <,,> was facing <,,> a political <,,> turmoil in the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#6:1:A>
What is <,,> this government <,,> even though a single party with
the largest members in this house <,,> was a minority government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#7:1:A>
And we know the difficulties <,,> of running <,,> a minority
government <,,> which has to take <,,> a number of bold <,,> economic
decision <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#8:1:A>
But <,,> within two and half years <,,> we have proved <,,> that
this government <,,> <}> <-> taken </-> <+> taking </+> </}> <,,> bold
political decisions and economic decisions <,,> could attain majority <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#9:1:A>
Sir this is two and half years <,,> there is <,,> a political <,,>
polarisation taking place in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#10:1:A>
It is this political polarisation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#11:1:A>
It is this political polarisation <,,> where <,,> anti <,> communal
<,> forces <,,> and democratic forces <,,> coming together <,,> under the
leadership of the <mention> Congress party </mention> <,,> that has given
<,,> a new political stability to the nation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#12:1:A>
Sir this government <,,> has taken decisions <,,> on all subjects
<,,> whether <,> the government was in a majority <,,> or whether <,> the
government was <,,> in a minority <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#13:1:A>
And for the Mandal issue <,,> we could find a solution <,,> in a
very <,> democratic manner <,> and all the backward communities in this
country are happy <,,> because they have got <,,> their due share <,,> in the
governmental machinery <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#14:1:A>
For about this <mention> Congress party </mention> has taken <,,> a
stand <,,> from the time of Pandit <,,> either this issue <,,> has to be
settled amicably <,,> by discussion between both the parties <,,> or <,> the
course of law <,,> has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply
seen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#15:1:A>
Sir <,> coming to the economic front <,,> we have taken <,> very
bold decisions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#16:1:A>
And you know <,,> when it came when it came to power <,,> two and
half years back <,> what was the economic situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#17:1:A>
The inflation <,> was at its highest <,,> up about seventeen
percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#18:1:A>
<-> The </-> <,,> if the foreign exchange reserves <,,> was kept
<,> four thousand <indig> crores </indig> <,,> in two and half years back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#19:1:A>
Now it has grown eight times more <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#20:1:A>
It is all around <,> twenty-two thousand <indig> crores </indig>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#21:1:A>
So <,> situation the over all situation <,> is very comfortable
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#22:1:A>
This comfortable situation <,> could be achieved <,> because of the
drastic measures <,> Congress has taken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#23:1:A>
Sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national
conference <,,> at <,,> Tirupati <,,> Narsimharao <,,> has explained <,,> in
detail <,> about the <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#24:1:A>
An important <O> one or two words </O> speech <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#25:1:A>
Since the beginning of the era of plan development <,,> the Indian
National Congress <,> has been inspired <,> and guided by the vision of
Jawaharlal Nehru <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#26:1:A>
He has strong sense of wisdom <,,> and deep understanding of the
<,> distinctive of the Indian resource <,,> let him to <O> one or two words
</O> <,,> all topman approaches <,> and evolved <,> India all synthesis <,>
for the diverse influence <,> which was inherently just <,> humane <,>
pragmatic <,> and uniquely Indian

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#27:1:A>
The use of developed development planning <,,> was <,> an
instrument <,,> to achieve this stand <,> and ensure <,,> the material well
being of the masses <,> and the dignity of the Indian <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#28:1:A>
So <,> sir we have never deviated <,> from <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#29:1:A>
And sir <,> when <,> our farmers <,,> are taking up this current
<,> we obliged <,,> in this house <,,> on one hand <,,> we have been <,> <O>
one word </O> what the political parties have been demanding <,> that <,> the
farmers should be given <,> a regularising price <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#30:1:A>
There is no party in this house which has not demanded that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#31:1:A>
Every party is demanding that the <O> one or two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#32:1:A>
And when we give regularising price naturally <,,> it has to be <,>
passed on to the consumers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#33:1:A>
In four <O> one or two words </O> <,> exports <,,> enable to March
ninety-two ninety-three <,> the growth of three point six percent <,> April
to December ninety-two it was only three point five percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#34:1:A>
April to December ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point <,>
nine percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#35:1:A>
Now sir coming to the employment <,,> we have taken a number of
steps during last two and a half years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#36:1:A>
The <,> <mention> Jawahar <indig> Rozgar Yojana </indig> </mention>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#37:1:A>
The <mention> Nehru <indig> Rozgar Yojana </indig> </mention> <,,>
then other programmes <,> other employment oriented programmes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#38:1:A>
Yet there is <,,> the unemployment in the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#39:1:A>
Sir <,> the achievement of scientists <,> the achievement of <,> in
the in our research field <,> sir the the the <,> the launching of the
<indig> Agni </indig> <,> is <,> something which is tough and fearless <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#40:1:A>
<w> It's </w> an achievement of a <,> group of a community of
scientists <,> who have been denied a number of facilities <,> foreign
facilities <,> foreign technology <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#41:1:A>
But <,> within themselves <,> they could <,> they could find out
ways and means solutions <,> so that today we are proud that <indig> Agni
</indig> has been launched <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#42:1:A>
Just like the <indig> Agni </indig> has been launched in the space
<,> and <w> I'm </w> sure sir sir <,> this government <,> will be able to
give a new thrust to our <O> one word </O> <,> a new thrust to our economic
structure <,> a new thrust to our industrial strength <,> so that <,> there
is economic prosperity in this country then the <,> peaceful the political
situation in this country

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#43:1:A>
Only request is that <,> all democratic forces <,> should help us
<,> should support us <,> this is my request <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-059#44:1:B>
I listened with care sir <,,> to the <,,> speech of <,,> my
honourable friend <,,> D S P Mathur <,,> as also the second of professor
Thomas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#45:1:B>
I also read sir with great care <,,> the text of the <,,> speech
<,,> which is really a <,,> not so much speech of the <,,> head of the
republic <,,> as it is in articulation of the <,,> governments view point
<,,> also what they have done <,,> in the year gone by <,,> and what they
intent doing <,,> in the year that is <,,> facing us now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#46:1:B>
So I could not <,,> help but carry an impression <,,> that the <,,>
that the <,,> that its a its a tired and a desperated emotions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#47:1:B>
A tired and desperated address <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#48:1:B>
It was <,> it was uninspiring in content <,,> and I was struck by
the fact <,,> of the recourse that government could take <,,> of loading this
speech with the <,,> a great deal of <,,> anti-statistical assertions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#49:1:B>
I found the address <,,> somewhat self-satisfied <,,> and <O>
one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#50:1:B>
The great deficiency that I find <,,> is the disharmony between the
assertions of government <,,> and uh <,,> what I have observed as a crippling
citizen <,,> that has <O> one word </O> <,,> many parts of national endeavour
<,> and national life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#51:1:B>
There is an impression <,> being different <,> and impression that
is attempted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#52:1:B>
An impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself
<,,> has been <O> one word </O> all to do <,> as if some kind of an imaginary
<,> hump has been crossed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#53:1:B>
Let me put it to <,,> the treasury bench <,,> if now <,> through an
immorality <,> through a performing of <,,> the participatory system of
government <,> is through <O> one word </O> of defaction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#54:1:B>
If through creating splits within one party after another <,> you
have rearranged the arithmatic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#55:1:B>
If you had simply rearranged the arithmatic <,> let me division not
<,> in variety of thoughts <,> that you have crossed some kind of an
imaginary hump and now <,> rosy pastures <,> upon the green pasture <,> lie
ahead of you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#56:1:B>
These are the first assertions that made <,,> by the Head of the
Republic <,,> and by the government <,,> is about the north-east <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#57:1:B>
These are his first assertions sir <,,> to create the situations
with regard to insurgency <,,> in the north-east <,> has shown improvement
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#58:1:B>
I do not know sir to what <,,> I should attribute such an assertion
<,,> that insurgency in the north-east <,> is improving <,> when the
Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has himself <,,> without going into all the
quotation from his report to the president <,,> it might be again <,,> be
repeated <,,> the Governor of Manipur and Nagaland <,> has said <,> but
clearly <,> amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency
<,,> and internal disorder <,> and you would observe Mr Speaker sir that he
is not talking in the past tense <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#59:1:B>
He is talking of position <,> as it exist <,> in that part of the
country <,> in the month <,,> of August to October <,,> of ninety-three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#60:1:B>
The above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder <,,> is
due <,> to lack of political stability and will <,,> lack of an overall
perception <,,> and monitoring of the worsening situation <,,> by the
governmental security forces <,> over after long period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#61:1:B>
You must have heard in the <O> one word </O> of government <,,>
cannot be made <,,> by agency of government itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#62:1:B>
And if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen <,> his
observation is limited to Manipur and Nagaland <,,> then <,,> at all <,,> I
am not convinced <,> that the words that have been put into the mouth of the
<,> head of the Republic <,,> by the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#63:1:B>
I do not know to what I should attribute them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#64:1:B>
Is it a step by the government to mislead the nation <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#65:1:B>
Is it an attempt by the government to draw <O> one word </O> over
the reality in the wake of the situation <,> that prevails in the north-east
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#66:1:B>
Or is it <,> is it an attempt <,,> to <,> to denigrate the
institution of Parliament <,> and to treat the entire exercise <,,> of the
<,> address to the joint session of the Parliament as a perfunctory exercise
of little importance <,> fairly to a <O> one word </O> sir <,,> that the
situation that we face in the north-east <,,> is of extreme <O> one word </O>
and the most extreme serious <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#67:1:B>
I <O> one word </O> in totality the assertion of the government <,>
that the situation in <,> entire north-east <,> is improving <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#68:1:B>
It has not improved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#69:1:B>
And the sense of complacency <,> about improving <,> that the
government seems to be putting across <,> is a very mislead sense <,> and it
will be extremely challenging to the Republic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#70:1:B>
Thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects
of the current situation <,,> of Jammu and Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#71:1:B>
There is an assertion made in the <w> President's </w> address <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#72:1:B>
And an assertion which suggests <,,> that it was the strength
displayed by the government <,,> in the unfortunate <.> in </.> <,> incident
at Hazratbal <,,> which restrained the demonstrative itself through success
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#73:1:B>
We have not yet sir <,> not yet <,> not till today <,,> the
Parliament has not authoritatively been told <,> as to what actually happened
in Hazratbal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#74:1:B>
The government has not yet come forward to tell <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#75:1:B>
I repeat that demand <,> we must come to know what actually
transpired <,> in Hazaratbal <,> during that period <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#76:1:B>
How did the situation come about <,> that <,> the army was obliged
to take seige <,,> to that uh <,> shrine <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#77:1:B>
And what transpired <,> when the siege was <,> subsequently
attempted <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#78:1:B>
What was the arrangement that the government made <,> with the
seventy or eighty <,> those who were in <,> those that were inside the shrine
<,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#79:1:B>
And how is it <,,> that when those that were inside the shrine <,,>
when they surrendered <,,> whom did they surrender to <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#80:1:B>
What was the role of the army <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#81:1:B>
And how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that
surrender <,> we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#82:1:B>
There is not a single one now sir <,> is in prison <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#83:1:B>
Not a single one <,> is today charged <,> as a serious terrorist
<,> meriting those serious try <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#84:1:B>
We were told that there are three or four or five <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#85:1:B>
I don't know how many <,,> foreign terrorists <,,> of foreign
nationality <,,> where are they now <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#86:1:B>
And these are not small issues that the nation can just take
lightly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#87:1:B>
I put it to you sir <,,> that in Hazratbal <,> it was <w> India's
</w> great good fortune which saved us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#88:1:B>
That this government made every possible mistake <,> in the
handling of the situation that it could have made <,> and that is in
Hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside <,>
surrendered <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#89:1:B>
They did not surrender sir <,> because of <,> the so called <,>
patience <,> shown by the government

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#90:1:B>
They surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of <&>
recording broken </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#91:1:B>
It was incapacity <,> incapacity to think <,> incapacity to act <,>
miserable failure <,> uh serious challenge to the nation as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#92:1:B>
I demand sir <,,> that unless the prospects of Hazratbal <,>
incident are shared with this house <,> we will continue to hold <,> I
certainly will continue to hold <,> that in Hazratbal this government in
charge <,> is making every possible mistake <,> that it could have <,> every
possible wrong that it could have for the nation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#93:1:B>
And if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything
that the government <,> did <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#94:1:B>
It was despite what the government did <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#95:1:B>
It is not a question sir <,> of this disarray simply at the level
of <,> Hazratbal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#96:1:B>
It is a disarray that start from the top here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#97:1:B>
That is disarray in decision making in the Union Home ministry
itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#98:1:B>
It is opened up <,,> we do not know dealing with Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#99:1:B>
The honourable <-> the </-> home minister for home <,> makes one
statement with certain assertion <,> is definitely <,> the honourable
minister for state <,> makes an other assertion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#100:1:B>
His excellency the Governor of Kashmir <,> makes a third assertion
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#101:1:B>
The army is left out on its <O> one word </O> <,> they make
certain suggestions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#102:1:B>
The security forces are left on the limp <,> they make another
suggestion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#103:1:B>
That disarray <,> this total lack of coordinate <,> arises not
simply in the <?> metalistic </?> sense <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#104:1:B>
It arises <,,> principally sir <,> from the conceptual <,> or a
<,,> what is it that we are <O> one or two words </O> what is it this
government is trying to do in Kashmir <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#105:1:B>
Where are we heading <,,> do you know sir <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#106:1:B>
And <w> I'll </w> be happy if <w> I'm </w> proven wrong <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#107:1:B>
And I will <,> I would demand of the government <,,> to share with
us the figures and to explain to us <,> that if these are government <O> one
word </O> <,> then how <- > was </-> such incident take <+> place </+> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#108:1:B>
I demand of government <,,> to share with the house the reality of
what is taking place today <,> in the district of Toda <,> in <O> one word
</O> <,> in <O> one word </O> <,> I demand of the government share with us
<,> what is taking place today by the <,,> raising of the head of insurgency
<,> in the <,,> district of Jammu <,,> in Udhampur <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#109:1:B>
I demand sir <,> that this the government owes not just to the
Parliament this the government owes to the nation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#110:1:B>
Unless the government share all this <,> with us <,> in this house
<,> the government stand charged of neglect <,> a very great neglect <,> of a
very great national priority <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#111:1:B>
And finally <,,> what about those three hundred thousand <,>
Kahsmiri <indig> pundit </indig> <,> who in their own homeland <,> so many
years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland <,> are homeless
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#112:1:B>
No one can disappoint for them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#113:1:B>
This government does not have time to even visit the camp

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#114:1:B>
The pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand <indig> pundit
</indig> for the last three to four years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#115:1:B>
I charge this government for the most <,> inhuman neglect of its
own citizen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#116:1:B>
This is the most telling example <,> of the blindness of this
government <,> in the face of human misery <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#117:1:B>
Sir we have this yesterday celebration <,,> of presentation of the
budget <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#118:1:B>
I accept that this uh his address to the <,,> uh joint session of
the parliament <,> is not a debate on the budget <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#119:1:B>
I am not going to even attempt that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#120:1:B>
But because the <,> speech of the President makes a reference <,>
to economic reform programme <,> and suggests to the joint-session <,> that
the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer <,>
to all the ill <O> one or two words </O> reflects the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#121:1:B>
Therefore very briefly I consider it my <,> uh obligation <,> to
put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#122:1:B>
Just look at <,,> four or five simple assertions <,> that I will
take which are not assertions that I make uh <O> one or two words </O> they
call it a very <O> one or two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-059#123:1:B>
These are the assertions that the honourable Union finance
minister has himself did <,,> </I>
