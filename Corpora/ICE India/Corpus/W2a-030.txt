LANDSAT </mention> , aerial photographs, geological maps and Survey of India
toposheets.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#5:1>
Such a critical study is extremely useful for geographers, geologists
and planners for a better planning and proper management of resources. </it>

It is bordered by Anantapur, Cuddapah and Nellore districts in the
north and by Tamil Nadu state in the south and east and by Karnataka state
towards the west ( Fig. 1 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#8:1>
It is one of the four districts of Rayalaseema and located in the
leeward side of the Western Ghats and hence became one of the rain-shadow
districts of the State.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#9:1>
It spreads over an area of 15152 sq. km. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#10:1>
<h> <bold> Land Systems </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#11:1>
The area under study lies in a transitional zone between the
interior plateau and the coastal plain.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#12:1>
In addition, the north-south running Eastern Ghat ranges run in the
middle of the district forming its backbone and the water divide for many
streams.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#13:1>
The district may, conveniently, be divided into three natural
divisions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#14:1>
<h> <it> The Western Hilly Region ( The Karnataka Plateau ) </it>
</h> comprises isolated hills and hillocks covering the western part of the
district.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#15:1>
<it> <mention> The Central Upland Region </mention> </it> comprises
three ranges : ( 1)

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#16:1>
Mahendragiri hills covering the taluks of <mention> Kuppam </mention>
, <mention> Palamaneru </mention> , <mention> Chittoor </mention> , <mention>
Vayalpadu </mention> and <mention> Chinnagottigallu </mention> ; ( 2)

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#17:1>
The southern portions of palakonda and Velikonda ranges partly
covering the taluks of <mention> Puttur </mention> , <mention> Nagari
</mention> and <mention> Satyavedu </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#18:1>
<h> <it> the Plain Region </it> </h> :

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#19:1>
It consists of the valley plains of <mention> Bahuda </mention> ,
<mention> Pincha </mention> , <mention> Palar </mention> , <mention>
Swarnamukhi </mention> , <mention> Arani </mention> and <mention> Nagari
</mention> rivers and the coastal plain which lies to the east of <mention>
Palakonda </mention> and <mention> nagari </mention> hills. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#20:1>
The relief and land systems of the study area are delineated
based on studies of toposheets and false colour composites of <mention>
LANDSAT </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#21:1>
The land Systems are delineated based on the assumption that similar
grey tones under similar topographic expressions reflect similar surface and
sub-surface moisture conditions, vegetation and organic content of the soils.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#22:1>
Light tones are considered to reflect red soils, colluvium and sands;
medium tones to reflect sandy soils to sandy loams on rolling plains; and
dark tones to sandy, silty clays on level plains namely, flood plains,
ancient channels etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#23:1>
These tones may help in delineating areas of relative importance in
locating groundwater also.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#24:1>
The land system identified <O> <&> page </&> 29 </O> <O> figure 1.
</O> are hilly terrain, undulating terrain, rolling plains, and fluvial
plains ( Fig. 2 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#25:1>
<h> <bold> Hilly Terrain </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#26:1>
The western part of the district is bordered by a group of hills
of the Eastern Ghats trending <mention> NE- </mention> <mention> NNE
</mention> and <mention> SE </mention> direction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#27:1>
These hills are composed mainly of granites, quartzites and
charnockites.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#28:1>
The general elevation in these hills ranges from 1,314 m, ( Horsely
Hills ) to 1,131 m, ( Tirumala Hills ) above MSL, with steep slopes extending
2 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#29:1>
Field studies in these regions also throw light on differential
weathering, paricularly in the regions where sections of folds are clearly
exposed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#30:1>
The general alignment of the disturbed hills in the western and
central parts shows that this region in the geological history could have
been a major domal structure and this contention has been upheld owing to the
presence of general radial pattern of drainage' in the district. </p> <O> <&>
page </&> 30 </O> <O> figure 2. </O> <O> <&> page </&> 31 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#31:1>
<h> <bold> Undulating Terrain </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#32:1>
The central undulationg terrain constitutes the hilly slopes,
piedmont plains, valley fills, pediplains and colluvial fans.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#33:1>
The presence of piedmont plains and colluvial fans with convex facing
slopes is an evidence to show that the rate of accumulation exceeds that of
transportation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#34:1>
<h> <bold> Rolling Plains </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#35:1>
The slope in these plains is low and varies from 2 to 5 per cent
or less than 2 per cent and constitutes creep-built plains, wash plains and
mixed soil plains.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#36:1>
The rolling nature of the plains is attributed to differential rate
of weathering, erosion and deposition of materials by gravity, stream and
wind action.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#37:1>
The rolling plains occupy the major part of the district constituting
red sandy soils, sandy loams and black soil plains and reflect low to medium
grey tones on the LANDSAT.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#38:1>
A few isolated hills / inselbergs stand out prominently in the plains
along with outcrops and give hindrance to agricultual operations. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#39:1>
<h> <bold> Fluvial Plains </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#40:1>
The major rivers during the course of their development of river
valleys have deposited fine-textured alluvial soils on either side of the
banks especially on the eastern part and as a result theis region is <quote>
` somewhat plain' </quote> in nature, with as lope less than 2 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#41:1>
These soils are very fertile and are usually used for cultivation of
rice, sugarcane etc. as reflected in dark grey tones on <mention> LANDSAT
</mention> ( band 7 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#42:1>
As the western and central parts of the district composed of a
number of hills aand hillocks with exposed outcrops, the panoramic view gives
the idea that it is more slopy and undulating.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#43:1>
The etymological study of some of the place names in the western part
of the district may support this contention, for example, <mention>
Rallabuduguru </mention> ( means, a place with stones ) , <mention>
Bodabandla </mention> ( meaning a barren hill ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#44:1>
Similarly, the eastern part which is somewhat plain and low lying in
nature, abounds with place names like <quote> <mention> ` pallam' </mention>
</quote> ( a low lying area ) , <quote> <mention> ` Thungundram' </mention>
</quote> ( slope of a hill ) etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#45:1>
<h> <bold> Landforms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#46:1>
The various landforms ( Fig.3 ) , identified on the basis of grey
tonal variation, crustal trends, nature of vegetation, soil texture and
drainage characteristics, etc., are classified into broad divisions according
to major geomorphic processes involved in their formation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#47:1>
<h> <bold> Denudational Landforms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#48:1>
Landforms that are grouped under this category owe their origin
predominantly to sheet movements of weathered material by erosion and
deposition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#49:1>
Exogenetic processes, namely degradation, weathering, mass wasting
and erosion have collectively played important roles in the destruction of
these landforms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#50:1>
After visiting various parts of the district it is concluded that
predominantly mechanical weathering process dominates over chemical
weathering process due to semi-arid nature of climate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#51:1>
Differential weathering in different parts of the hilly terrain,
particularly in Horsely Hills, in the west and Nagari Hills in the east,
throws light on structural disturbances which have played significant role in
partial destruction of granitic terrain in this part of the district. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#52:1>
<h> <bold> Remnants of Planation Surfaces </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#53:1>
Relatively flat topped gentle slopes with barren surface and
isolated hills reflecting light to medium grey tones at an altitude of about
750 m in the district are presumed to be some of the remnants of planation
surfaces.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#54:1>
However, these surfaces are not associated with lateritic cappings in
the eastern part.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#55:1>
A series of profiles taken in east-west direction ( Fig. 4 ) throw
light to the effect that there could have been four denudational levels,
namely, 150-300 m, <O> <&> page </&> 32 </O> <O> figure 3. </O> <O> caption
</O> <O> <&> page </&> 33 </O> <O> figure 4. </O> <O> caption </O> 300-600 m,
and 600-900, and above 900 m.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#56:1>
Levels lying in between 150-300 m, 300-600 m and 600-900 m may
indicate that they could have been planation surfaces. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#57:1>
<h> <bold> Domal Hills </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#58:1>
<mention> Domal hills </mention> are those broad warps in which
the rocks posses slight dips and appears nearly horizontal.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#59:1>
They sometimes have elliptical anticlines.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#60:1>
Such kind of domal hills are identified in <mention> LANDSAT
</mention> ( band 7 ) as grey coloured patches. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#61:1>
<h> <bold> Narrow and Elongated Ridges ( Dykes ) </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#62:1>
<mention> The Archaens </mention> in the district occupying
nearly 60 per cent of the total area, mainly consists of <mention> schists
</mention> , <mention> granites </mention> and <mention> gneisses </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#63:1>
They are generally intruded by quartz veins and dolerite dykes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#64:1>
These dykes are found traversing the granitic rocks and look like
linear ridges.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#65:1>
They play vital role in controlling the movement of groundwater by
acting as sub-suface dams and effectively stop the lateral movement of
groundwater. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#66:1>
<h> <bold> Pediplains </bold> </h>

<p> Pediplanation is generally accepted as the process responsible for
landscape evolution as an alternative to the concept of process of
peneplanation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#67:1>
A pediplain is also considered a plain resulting from coalescence of
a number of pediments over a sizable area developed by the process operating
in a semi-arid cycle of denudation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#68:1>
In the area under study, the pediplain is well marked on the northern
and western parts of the district.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#69:1>
They are in continuation of the pediplain described by Vaidyanathan (
4).

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#70:1>
These plains in Chittoor District are covered by red sandy soils with
a few residual hills and they reflect very light tone in the <mention>
LANDSAT </mention> ( band 7 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#71:1>
<h> <bold> Lateritic Uplands </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#72:1>
Uplands with lateritic cappings are observed in the eastern part
of the district, where wet and dry conditions alternate. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#73:1>
<h> <bold> Residual Hills </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#74:1>
The multicyclic residual mountains, namely exfoliation domes,
tors, boulders and domal <O> <&> page </&> 34 </O> hills are well distributed
over the plains of piedmont colluvial plains, pediments and pediplains.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#75:1>
Typical tors and boulders of <mention> granitic gneisses </mention>
are numerous in the around the study area causing obstructions to
agricultural operations. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#76:1>
<h> <bold> Structural Landforms </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#77:1>
<h> <bold> Hogbacks </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#78:1>
<mention> Hogbacks </mention> are sharp crested ridges which
develop where the rock dips are steep.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#79:1>
In the study area <mention> hogbacks </mention> are identified in the
north-eastern part of the district. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#80:1>
<h> <bold> Mesa / Butte </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#81:1>
<mention> Mesa / Butte </mention> is an isolated table-land,
capped with protective covering which is essentially horizontal in attitude.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#82:1>
<mention> Mesas / Buttes </mention> are identified in the eastern
part of the district. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#83:1>
<h> <bold> Escarpments </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#84:1>
An escarpment or scarp is defined as steep rock-face of great
length.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#85:1>
Two general types are recognised, namely, <mention> structural
</mention> and <mention> erosional escarpments </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#86:1>
<mention> Structural escarpment </mention> is a direct product of
fault displacement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#87:1>
In the study area, the Tirumala Hills, Nagari Hills, parts of Kuppam
hills and other minor hill ranges show distinct steep escarpments, which run
to a distance of about 2 to 5 km.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#88:1>
The Tirumala escarpment might have been formed by the structural
activity during the development of Tirupati valley upto Nagari nose. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#89:1>
<h> <bold> Fluvial Landforms </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#90:1>
The rivers, <mention> Swarnamuki </mention> , <mention> Arani
</mention> , and <mention> Ponnai </mention> , have developed conspicuous
flood plains which are likely to be inundated during peak flood periods.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#91:1>
The plains relatively show low relief.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#92:1>
A flood plain is usually built by later deposits with variations, and
its drainage denotes that some of the rivers are structurally controlled.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#93:1>
The river <mention> Ponnai </mention> in Chittoor town flowing
south-east seems to be controlled by a fault, lying parellel to the river
course.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#94:1>
The river-built plains are utilised for cultivation of rice,
sugarcane and banana.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#95:1>
Old channels of river <mention> Arani </mention> could be traced on
<mention> LANDSAT </mention> and due to the change of river courses, fluvial
terraces could also be traced. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#96:1>
<h> <bold> Alluvial Fans </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#97:1>
<mention> Alluvial fans </mention> are more or less analogous to
deltas where a heavily loaded stream emerges from the mountain course to the
low-lying area.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#98:1>
There is a marked change in gradient resulting in deposition of
alluvium apexing at the point of emergence and spreading out in fan-like form
on the low land.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#99:1>
In the study area two fans are identified in the upper course of
<mention> Swarnamuki </mention> , the north-eastern part of the district.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#100:1>
<h> <bold> Abandoned Channels </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#101:1>
The abandoned channels ( variously designated by diferent
authors as <quote> ` ancient channels', ` buried channels', ` paleo-channels'
</quote> etc., ) are identified by the aerial photographs based on the
conspicuous low relief and sinuous trend, usually lying sub-parallel to the
main river courses.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#102:1>
Most of them are low lying agricultural fields subjected to floods
at different intervals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#103:1>
The winding nature of these channels with a number of <quote> `
cut-offs' </quote> indicates successive changes in the course of the rivers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#104:1>
In the present study, a number of abandoned channels has been
identified in the <mention> Nagari </mention> and <mention> Araniar
</mention> rivers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#105:1>
A special but interesting feature has been identified in the
present study.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#106:1>
Almost all the minor rivulets of <mention> Swarnamuki </mention>
originating in <mention> Tirupati hill ranges </mention> show a general
south-east direction, making sudden easterly turn without joining <mention>
Swarnamukihi </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#107:1>
It is said that all these streams were the tributaries in the
beginning, due to some sudden event in the geological history of the basin,
they changed their course affecting thereby <w> <mention> Swarnamukhi's
</mention> </w> direction from south-east to north-east.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#108:1>
A number of paleo-channels in its course further authenticated this
view. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 35 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#109:1>
<h> <bold> Fluvio-Colluvial Landforms </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#110:1>
<h> <bold> Creep Built Plains </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#111:1>
These are the deposits composed of unassorted material with
angular gravel, pebbles and cobbles in a matrix of coarse sand and grit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#112:1>
The creep-built plains are partly derived from the bordering hilly
terrain and the piedmont colluvial plains by gravity, sheet wash and sheet
flow.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#113:1>
The thickness of sediments in these plains also varies from 2 to 7 m
and the slope ranges from 2 to 5 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#114:1>
The creep-built plains are very widely deposited on the eastern and
central parts of the district. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#115:1>
<h> <bold> Wash Plains </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#116:1>
These are stretches of plains next to creep-built plains and
pediments near to residual hills, with slope less than 2 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#117:1>
They are composed of mixed soils, namely, red sandy and silt soils,
which might have formed partly due to over flowing of water over these plains
during peak flood periods along major river courses.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#118:1>
On the eastern part of the district some patches of black soil
plains which have been derived from the situ biotite gneisses, may also be
noticed. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#119:1>
<h> <bold> Pediment and Colluvial Plains </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#120:1>
These are cut rock surfaces with thin to thick veneer of debris.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#121:1>
According to Mabbut ( 3), they are rarely composed of sub-alluvial
sediments over the existing pediments possibly due to lateral deposition of
sediments by fluvial action.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#122:1>
The pediments are distinctly noticed in an around <mention> Tirumala
hills </mention> and <mention> Kuppam hills </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#123:1>
The main processes involved in the moulding of pediments are
<mention> weathering </mention> , <mention> rainwash </mention> , <mention>
sheetwash </mention> and <mention> sheet </mention> flow.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#124:1>
The low angle of pediment and low relative releif of residual
remnants are presumed to be due to uniform lithology.

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#125:1>
In a few pockets, granites and charnockites are left as remnants of
residual boulder indicating that the pediments here owe their origin more to
lithological control than to differential erosion. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-030#126:1>
<h> <bold> Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-030#127:1>
Physiographically, the district may broadly be divided into 3
zones viz., ( a) the western hilly region of more than 750 m elevation, ( b)
the central upland region which is undulating and dotted with ridges and
clusters of rocky hills and hillocks of granitic origin, and ( c) the eastern
plain region of narrow width with less than 50 m of elevation. </p> </I>
