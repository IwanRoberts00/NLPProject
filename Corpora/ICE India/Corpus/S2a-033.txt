<ICE-IND:S2A-033#1:1:A>
Madam <,> Principal <,,> Prof Surendragopal <,> Department of  
History <,> and director I E S coaching Institute <,,> uh officers from the  
university <,,> different teachers <,,> coming from <,,> different parts of  
the Eastern regions <,,> students <,> ladies and gentleman <,,> I am very  
happy <,,> that the course has been organised <,,> for increasing <,>  
proficiency in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#2:1:A>
I am not uh myself a very proficient man in English <,,> uh being a  
student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout <,> and as you know <,>  
the technocrats and scientists <,,> they mostly do through symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#3:1:A>
You will say is equal to <w> we'll </w> write a two parallel lines  
and it remain you see <,> even the same thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#4:1:A>
In fact uh any language <,,> is uh <,> also a symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#5:1:A>
You have a vocabulary <,,> and <,,> you use words <,> you combine  
them in such a way <,,> that it conveys your feelings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#6:1:A>
The general concept of having proficiency in English <,> like a  
common man you will say <,,> if we get something written in a very <,,> uhm  
difficult or <O> one word </O> way they will say oh he is the man is very  
proficient <,> or if you <,> listen to a speech <,,> in which you don't  
follow most of the things <,,> then you will say that he is a very learned  
man we could not follow <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#7:1:A>
But my concept is uh I mean and I think the people will also agree  
with me <,,> <w> it's </w> different <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#8:1:A>
A man is having proficiency in any language <,,> if <,,> he is able  
to convey <,,> what he wants to <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#9:1:A>
If you are not in a position to convey your feeling <,> or your  
thinking or your thoughts <,,> then no matter which <,> language you use <,,>  
uh you are not <,,> fulfilling your objective <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#10:1:A>
So I think this type of courses <,,> should we organised <,,> not  
only for those who are doing courses in English <,,> or uh those who have  
taken <,,> English as a subject <,,> but mostly for such persons <,,> who  
don't get opportunity <,,> to use English <,,> uh to that extent as is <,>  
done by other <,> English student <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#11:1:A>
For example technocrats or doctors you will see <,> that these  
technical people <,,> even uh <,> say for example a doctor he will write a  
prescription <,,> except a few those who are very brilliant <,> otherwise  
also <,,> that you can't read the name of the medicines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#12:1:A>
I was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read  
and give the appropriate medicine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#13:1:A>
I was very much worried how that fellow can read and I can't read  
it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#14:1:A>
Then later on I don't know whether it is a fact or uh <,,> not <,>  
but somebody said <,> <quote> The doctor they can't write the name of the  
medicine correctly <,,> they will always commit a spelling mistake <,> so  
they just give some kind of symbol <,,> and a person who is <,> uh dealing  
with all these kinds of medicine in day today life <,,> looking at the  
prescription <,,> that what is the disease what is the symptom <,> they will  
give you the appropriate medicine </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#15:1:A>
So that is the story for a technical people and you have I don't  
know how you have invited me <,> either it is by virtue of the position I  
occupy in the University <,> or <,,> I mean unknowingly you consider me very  
learned man that I can speak on any subject given to me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#16:1:A>
Originally <,,> I was asked to distribute the certificates only <,>  
and I mean I was very happy <,,> due to the simple reason that I will have  
the opportunity of <,> listening <+> to </+> people having proficiency in  
English <,,> and at least I can uh <,> learn how to write correct English  
<,,> and increase uh <,> some of my vocabulary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#17:1:A>
Anyway <,,> I am very happy <,,> that <,,> inspite of <,,> a very  
adverse <,> social and political situation <,,> due to election <,,> and uh  
<,> adverse weather condition <,,> this sweating <,> and intense heat <,>  
temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade <,> I  
think during this period itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#18:1:A>
Lot of variation in the temperature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#19:1:A>
You have conducted the course <,,> upto the satisfaction of the  
participant <,,> as I could uh <,> gather from the <,,> reaction survey <,,>  
uh given by <,> <-> to </-> a student <,,> you have stayed here <,> you must  
I mean those who have come from outside <,> they must uh <,,> have faced lot  
of difficulty I don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through  
<,,> uh 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#20:1:A>
I don't know <w> I'm </w> I am not aware <,,> but I I I hope <,,>  
uh they must have taken you round <,,> to the places uh like Rajgir <,> or  
say Bodhgaya <,> or some other uh uh <,,> places <,,> of tourist <,> tourist  
interest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#21:1:A>
I <,,> especially <}> <-> thanks </-> <+> thank </+> </}> uh <,>  
those faculty members <,,> who have come from outside the state <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#22:1:A>
By their presence <,> our students have been <,> encouraged <,,>  
they have been benefitted <,,> and <,,> they uh <,,> will be benefitted in  
the long run <,,> even the course duration was rather <,,> uh only two and  
<,> three week <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#23:1:A>
Three weeks <,,> but <-> a </-> still <-> a </-> three <}> <-> week  
</-> <+> weeks </+> </}> <,> are sufficient <,,> for this type of courses  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#24:1:A>
I <,,> express my sincere thanks <,,> uh to uh <,> the Institute  
Central Institute of <,> Foreign Language at Hyderabad <,,> for <,> selecting  
Patna as one of the <}> <-> centre </-> <+> centres </+> </}> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#25:1:A>
Normally now the concept outside the state is <,,> Patna is a very  
disturbed place <,,> and <,> rather it is very difficult in most of the  
situations to organise successfully <,,> uh such a course <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#26:1:A>
I don't know whether it was well publicised or not <,> because most  
of the participants are girls <,,> only few boys uh <,> students I could find  
<,,> and mostly they are from Patna university <,,> mostly from here <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#27:1:A>
Uh so I believe it can be well publicise we can invite <,> teacher  
<,> actually we really <,,> need <,> to <,> teach teacher <,,> how to teach  
English <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#28:1:A>
Or for that matter how to teach uhm <,,> what you call <,> any  
subject <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#29:1:A>
Now this English is uh <,,> so much essential <,,> with the advent  
of computer and <}> <-> <.> oth </.> </-> <=> other </=> </}> electronic  
gadgets <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#30:1:A>
Actually now we have developed a language which can be understood  
by a machine <,,> if you are using mostly in uh <,> computer side <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#31:1:A>
There <,,> a still either Hindi or English or for that uh <,> sorry  
uh Sanskrit <,,> or any other language <,> they don't have any place <,>  
still there 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#32:1:A>
Maybe <,,> with further development we can do it uh <,,> uh other  
languages also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#33:1:A>
But <,,> inspite of all uh uh <}> <-> effort </-> <+> efforts </+>  
</}> by the government <,,> or uh <,> by other agencies <,> to promote Hindi  
or any other language <,,> we can't do away with uh <,> uh English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#34:1:A>
Because it is a language <,,> which is <-> a </-> essential for at  
least <,> scientific knowledge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#35:1:A>
In the scientific world you can't do <,,> with any other language  
except English <,> even in Russia <,> or uh <,> in France or any other  
country using some other kind of foreign language <,> <w> they've </w> to  
write a computer programme in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#36:1:A>
So <,,> <w> they're </w> actually mostly it is symbols 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#37:1:A>
But even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language  
<,> becomes essential <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#38:1:A>
With all these words <,> I again thank <,,> all the participants  
and congratulate <,,> the <}> <-> student </-> <+> students </+> </}> for <->  
a </-> participating in <,> such type of course <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#39:1:A>
I am thankful <,> to the authorities <,,> for giving me an  
opportunity <,,> to be with the learned <}> <-> scholar </-> <+> scholars  
</+> </}> <,> from all over the country <,> or mostly from the Eastern region  
state <,> and the participants of the schools <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-033#40:1:A>
Thank you very much <,,> <O> clapping </O> </I>
