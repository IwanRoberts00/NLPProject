<ICE-IND:S2B-040#1:1:A>
This is All India Radio Bombay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#2:1:A>
It is nine thirty <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#3:1:A>
We shall now hear a talk <,,> entitled <mention> Random Thoughts  
</mention> <,> by Dr Usha Thakkar <,,> </&> 
 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#4:1:A>
Questions before us are baffling <,> and issues around us are  
overwhelming <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#5:1:A>
When I start thinking about them <,> I get taken over by their  
variety and volume <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#6:1:A>
And these different strands are woven together <,> and the emerging  
picture becomes clear and grim <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#7:1:A>
And I start wondering <,> what is happening to us <,> as individual  
<,> as society <,> as a nation <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#8:1:A>
Crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#9:1:A>
Is it political <,> economic <,> cultural or the crisis of life  
itself <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#10:1:A>
We see many young children <,> begging on streets <,> and working  
in dangerous conditions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#11:1:A>
We hear many incidents <,> about young women <,> being burnt for  
dowry <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#12:1:A>
Innocent persons <,> getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded  
labour <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#13:1:A>
And the youth going astray <,> due to lack of direction <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#14:1:A>
We read about many massacres <,> in cities and villages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#15:1:A>
We know many persons <,> who exchange their ethics and ideals for  
money <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#16:1:A>
We are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#17:1:A>
Our attention is often drawn <,> to scandal in educational  
institutions <,> the citadels of learning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#18:1:A>
And nothing happens to us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#19:1:A>
Have we lost our sensitivity <,> the very core of human life <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#20:1:A>
We preach morality to children <,> and we talk of values to all <,>  
but we do not hesitate in compromising <,> when it comes to personal gain <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#21:1:A>
We see nothing wrong in seeking personal <,> favours <,> for  
gratification <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#22:1:A>
Is this in accordance <,> with what we say <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#23:1:A>
And what impact is it going to have on the young generation <,> who  
get bewildered and confused <,> by this discrepancy between action and  
preaching <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#24:1:A>
Corruption seems to have penetrated <,> in all spheres of life <,>  
and worse then that <,> it seems that we have accepted <,> that it has come  
to stay <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#25:1:A>
Work culture gets adversely affected by this <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#26:1:A>
Demands for rights are put forward <,> without due consideration to  
duties <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#27:1:A>
Previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#28:1:A>
Consumerism and hedonism dominate our time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#29:1:A>
Pursuit of comfort <,> mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for  
the same <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#30:1:A>
The importance of money <,> is accepted unchallenged <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#31:1:A>
Everything starts getting measured in terms of money <,> and then  
<,> values are turned in prices <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#32:1:A>
People get <,> to use Henry <w> Millers' </w> expression <,>  
<quote> Protected by money <,> learnt by money <,> dulled by money </quote>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#33:1:A>
New inventions <,> advance in technology <,> and wonders of  
computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#34:1:A>
But <w> we'll </w> not go in ahead without values and ideals <,>  
pushes into an age of despair and destruction <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#35:1:A>
Emerson had said that <quote> The true test of civilization is <,>  
not the census <,> not the size of cities <,> nor the crops <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#36:1:A>
No <,> but the kind of man <,> the country turns out </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#37:1:A>
Unfortunately today we see <,> men surrendering their ideals to  
expediency <,> and yielding their sensitivity to the pressure of power <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#38:1:A>
Respect for human value <,> and constraints on <,> human greed <,>  
and lust were never more important <,> than they are today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#39:1:A>
Gandhi had pointed out <,> that hankering after riches <,> forces  
one <,> to exploitation in some form or other <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#40:1:A>
The modern civilization <,> with its emphasis on materialism <,>  
and its basis of exploitation of the weak <,> is equivalent to darkness and  
disease <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#41:1:A>
True civilization consists <,> not in accumulation of commodity <,>  
but <,> in a deliberate and voluntary reduction of one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#42:1:A>
Politics <,> bereft of religion <,> is a death trap because <,> it  
kills the soul <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#43:1:A>
Unfortunately today we are at such junction in history <,> where  
the line between good and evil <,> often gets blurred <,> and consequently  
the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#44:1:A>
The practice of putting <,> profits before prudence <,> and the  
instinct of putting <mention> I </mention> before <mention> we </mention> <,>  
have eroded the foundation of human values <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#45:1:A>
If humanity itself is lost <,> would a human being be a human <,>  
or a mere robot <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#46:1:A>
In that case <,> what about future <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#47:1:A>
One undoubtedly is in agreement <,> which the Russian poet Andrei  
Muroyiv when he said <,> that <quote> I am not interested in the twenty-first  
century <,> if it will be only robots <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#48:1:A>
It can happen but it will be death <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#49:1:A>
We will be alive <,> but dead </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#50:1:A>
We start enumerating <,> the advantages and gains <,> profits and  
pay-offs <,> and neglect <,> human values and human emotions <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#51:1:A>
We ignore the highways <,> and start getting lost <,> in lanes and  
by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#52:1:A>
As a nation <,> we are going through rough times <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#53:1:A>
Nationalism often becomes synonym <,> with <?> factitious </?>  
politics <,> and this gives boost <,> to destabilizing and destructive forces  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#54:1:A>
Ugly forces of communalism <,> fundamentalism <,> regionalism <,>  
and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#55:1:A>
Instances <,> of communal riots and political violence provide  
material <,> for headlines to media <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#56:1:A>
Events and happening <,> in the field of politics <,> indicate  
clearly that politics <,> is the game of power <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#57:1:A>
The game of ruthless strategies <,> the game of selfish interest  
<,> where moral norms <,> and high ideals are pushed aside <,> and where  
credibility and accountability <,> become meaningless words <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#58:1:A>
Problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#59:1:A>
Basic needs of food <,> shelter <,> and clothing of the people have  
yet to be fulfilled <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#60:1:A>
Rising prices <,> inflation <,> and unemployment <,> bring  
unprecedented pressures on the common man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#61:1:A>
Today problems are many and solutions are not simple <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#62:1:A>
We have to accept the fact <,> that ours is a plural society <,>  
where diversity in religion <,> caste <,> community <,> and language is  
overwhelming <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#63:1:A>
This plurality <,> cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus  
<,> nor can they be <}> <-> blinded </-> <=> branded </=> </}> as  
confrontation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#64:1:A>
Aspirations and grievances of various ethnic <,> religious <,>  
linguistic <,> and minority groups demand special attention <,> to cultural  
ethos and recognition to diversity <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#65:1:A>
As the noise over <,> <mention> Masjid-Mandir </mention> <,>  
employment and social justice <,> ethnic diversity and minority rights <,> is  
getting louder <,> law and order situation <,> is worsening <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#66:1:A>
The weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still  
suffer from discrimination <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#67:1:A>
Here I would like to focus on the status of women <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#68:1:A>
Even now <,> after so many years of Independence <,> women suffer  
problems <,> of inequality and discrimination <,> dependant and domination  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#69:1:A>
Some individual women have achieved <,> stupendous success in some  
fields such as education and politics <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#70:1:A>
The Constitution has granted equality <,> and some progressive laws  
are enacted <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#71:1:A>
But the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#72:1:A>
The literacy rate among women <,> is only thirty-nine point  
forty-two percent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#73:1:A>
The fact to remind <,> that India is a nation <,> where people  
belonging to different <,> religions live and practice <,> their own way of  
life <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#74:1:A>
The Constitution did not establish a common civil code <,> and the  
personal laws of different communities <,> remain operative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#75:1:A>
It is unfortunate <,> that in a democratic and secular state like  
ours <,> all the women are not on equal footing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#76:1:A>
Women of different <,> religions and communities suffer under  
oppressive personal laws <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#77:1:A>
Traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots  
in our social system <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#78:1:A>
Revival of religious fundamentalism <,> intensifies the threat to  
<w> women's </w> equality <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#79:1:A>
It is sad to note that social evils like <mention> dedication of  
girls to temple <,> polygamy </mention> <,> and <mention> seclusion of women  
</mention> <,> have thrived <,> in the name of religion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#80:1:A>
There are some laws <,,> which provide protection to women <,> but  
the cunning and conniving <,> do not take long to find the loop holes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#81:1:A>
Moreover <,> the process is long <,> painful and expensive <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#82:1:A>
The question remains <,> how many women would muster courage and  
resources <,> to fight discrimination <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#83:1:A>
Bigamy is still not extinct <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#84:1:A>
The provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently  
violated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#85:1:A>
<w> Women's </w> access <,> to rights <,> of property <,>  
maintenance <,> inheritance <,> divorce <,> alimony and custody of children  
<,> get limited <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#86:1:A>
Many laws <,,> lose their meaning in the absence of proper  
implementation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#87:1:A>
Though it is one of the duties <,> of an Indian citizen <,> to  
renounce all practices <,> derogatory to the dignity of women <,> women are  
often subjected to atrocity <,> like grave or physical assault <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#88:1:A>
Trade in human flesh is still prevalent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#89:1:A>
Rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma <,> and damage to their  
personality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#90:1:A>
Crimes against women <,> continue to rise <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#91:1:A>
There were more than six thousand reported <,> victims of rape in  
nineteen eighty-seven <,> and more than fifteen hundred dowry deaths <,>  
including burning <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#92:1:A>
The declining sex ratio <,> is an issue causing grave concern <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#93:1:A>
The nineteen ninetey-one census <,> shows only nine hundred and  
twenty-nine women against <,> thousand man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#94:1:A>
This is an issue <,> not just of number but a pointer at our social  
reality <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#95:1:A>
Neglect at every stage <,> is the fate of the women <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#96:1:A>
Survival itself becomes difficult <,> as is evident from the misuse  
of the sex determination test <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#97:1:A>
Age specific death rate indicate <,> higher rates for female  
children <,> and women upto thirty-five years of age <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#98:1:A>
The discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#99:1:A>
The provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work <,> do  
not reach all women and <,> provisions are not properly implemented <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#100:1:A>
Almost <,> ninety percent of women workers <,> are engaged in  
unorganized sector <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#101:1:A>
Studies clearly show <,> that modernisation and mechanisation tend  
to marginalise women in many sectors <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#102:1:A>
The fact remains <,> that there cannot be division of women into  
groups of working women and non-working women <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#103:1:A>
Women work <,> but their work goes unnoticed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#104:1:A>
Invisible hands of women are always at work <,> but the data  
system with respect to <w> women's </w> work is imperfect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#105:1:A>
Estimates of the average hours of unpaid work <,> done by women  
<,> outside their homes vary from six to seven hours per day <,> with some  
women working upto ten hours or more <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#106:1:A>
Apart from the domestic duty <,> women are engaged in agricultural  
operation <,> for an average of twelve hours a day <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#107:1:A>
They have to keep themselves and their families alive <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#108:1:A>
In rural areas <,> thirty to thirty-five percent of household <,>  
are headed by women <,> still there access to ownership of land <,> and  
property is negligible <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#109:1:A>
Women find it extremely difficult <,> to enter the male dominated  
field of politics <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#110:1:A>
The crucial fact is <,> that women find themselves being judged  
<,> and often judging themselves by two different standards <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#111:1:A>
One standard is of traditional role of the private world <,> which  
regards her as homebound <,> nurturing <,> submissive and emotional <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#112:1:A>
The other standard is <,> of her changed role in the public world  
<,> which expects her to be ambitious <,> rational <,> progressive and  
competetive <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#113:1:A>
This private public divide bring severe pressures on her <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#114:1:A>
Other deterrants in her way are <,> approach of political parties  
<,> prohibitive election expenses <,> demands of home <,> and family <,> and  
fear of character assassination <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#115:1:A>
Still we have a long way to go <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#116:1:A>
Democratic notions of equality and liberty <,> have to percolate  
in her day-to-day life <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#117:1:A>
Journey of democracy <,> is never static or uneventful <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-040#118:1:A>
Today realities are hard and challenges are tough <,> but we the  
people of India have to give a positive response <,,> </I>
