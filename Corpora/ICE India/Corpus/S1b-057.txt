<ICE-IND:S1B-057#1:1> Dr Vasant Pawar </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-057#2:1:A>
Emerging optimism <,,> and this optimism <,,> is basically
because of the policies of the government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#3:1:A>
A response <,,> by the people <,,> of our country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#4:1:A>
The Indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance
<,,> and we have to struggle hard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#5:1:A>
Our late <,,> prime minister our leader <,,> <indig> Smt </indig>
Indiraji Gandhi has said <,,> I quote <,> <quote> strength never comes from
the comfort of smooth path <,> but from the most sterness <,> of the efforts
</quote> unquote <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#6:1:A>
Honourable President in his address there are sixth state situation
in Jammu and Kashmir I think

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#7:1:A>
That is quite sufficient <,,> a warning to the Pakistan and the <,>
United States <,> of America not to <-> fear </-> <,> interfere in the
matters of Jammu and Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#8:1:A>
And not to teach us <,,> the human rights <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#9:1:A>
It is that I must say <,,> that <,> a minor national minorities
finance development corporation has been set up <,,> and five hundred <indig>
crores </indig> are kept for the development of minorities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#10:1:A>
And a new <indig> Wakf </indig> Bill <,,> nineteen ninety-three
will definitely help <,> in deciding the matters of <indig> wakf </indig>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#11:1:A>
With this <,> the development of the poor <,> by way of <,>
<mention> Jawahar Rozgar Yojna </mention> <,,> for I R D P <,,> employment
assurance scheme <mention> Mahila Samrudhi Yojna </mention> <,> <mention>
Safai Karmacharya </mention> <,> they are the <,> main <,> milestones <,> in
the development of our <,> poor and <,> down-trodden people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#12:1:A>
Let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best
in building our nation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#13:1:A>
We are approaching twenty-first century <,> and twenty-first
century will be of <,,> the honesty the integrity the accountability the
productivity <,> and the quality also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#14:1:A>
And we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce <,> more oil <,>
more electricity <,> more fertilisers <,> more foodgrains <,> and more of the
basic needs of our people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#15:1:A>
Our government and our political system <,,> are strong enough <,>
technologically and otherwise <,,> not to allow our self- reliance <,> to be
mortgaged outside by an outside funds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#16:1:A>
So friends we must come <,> together we should march ahead for the
self-reliance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#17:1:A>
We should call little operation forward <,> faster and forward <,>
<O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#18:1:A>
Shri Pawan Kumar Bansal </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-057#19:1:B>
Sir <,,> in an ambience of <,,> widely present chaos <,,> and
lack of self-confidence <,> that permeated the national thought <,> when the
present government <,> took over the responsibility <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#20:1:B>
It was a doubting task <,,> particularly as a minority government
<,,> to rebuild <,,> brick by brick <,,> in situations that least settled
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#21:1:B>
Rejuvenate the economy <,,> that was in a shamble <,,> and regain
<,,> practice in the <?> comedy </?> of nations <,,> that was its lowest at
its lowest ebb then <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#22:1:B>
In June nineteen ninety-one <,,> there was a frightening question
mark <,,> mocking at us <,,> about the future of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#23:1:B>
A resolute endeavour <,,> was steadly transforming that into a ray
of hope <,,> when suddenly <,,> a cataclysmic event <,,> on sixth of December
nineteen <,,> ninety-two <,> threw the nation <,,> in the throes of <,>
communal <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#24:1:B>
With the fall of <,,> the mosque <,,> dangers of equating democracy
<,,> with the tyranny of group <,,> ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of
the majority <,> religious communities <,,> became real <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#25:1:B>
This <,,> cast a telling impacts <,,> not only on <w> India's </w>
honour <,,> but also our economy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#26:1:B>
Clouds of uncertainity started hovering <,,> for the economic
reforms <,,> initiated <O> one word </O> by the present government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#27:1:B>
The foreign investors <,,> grew doubtful about the <,,> disability
<,,> of investing in a country <,,> which was <,> in the whirlpool of <,,>
communal <,,> unrest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#28:1:B>
It was <,,> with this uncertain <,,> and <,,> unpleasant prospect
<,,> that we entered <,> the year under review <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#29:1:B>
The deliberate <,,> and concerted effect from forces from within
and across the borders <,,> to destabilise the country <,,> only strengthen
the resolve of the prime minister <,,> to fight that <,> with greater vigour
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#30:1:B>
The people also extended support <,,> in ample measure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#31:1:B>
Sir today <,,> with <mention> Congress </mention> <,,> attaining
majority in this house <,,> these reckless moves <,> which we have witnessed
over the last two and a half years <,,> and which gave <,,> a friend on the
other side some false hopes <,,> have been given <,,> a fitting burial <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#32:1:B>
And the subsequent event <,,> has started getting results <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#33:1:B>
The prime <w> minister's </w> recent visit <,,> to Germany <,> and
about the <,> Switzerland <,,> was a resounding success <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#34:1:B>
With the brightening up of <,,> the investment climate in our
country <,,> offers for economic tie-up <,,> are pouring in faster than never
before <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#35:1:B>
The government on its part <,,> has made it a <O> two words </O>
<,,> but the changes under way <,,> do not and will not <,,> tinkle with the
basic postulates of a mixed economy <,,> and that none in the country <,,>
would be adversely affected thereby <,> <&> noise </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#36:1:B>
Fears and strength on behalf of the workers <,> <{> <[> <O> a few
words </O> <,> <O> two words </O> <,,> seem to be only stimulated for
critical purposes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#37:1:B>
All ventures are rather intended to create greater <,>
opportunities for the people to improve <,> their living conditions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#38:1:B>
Sir <,,> a natural outcome of <,,> the sober and mature leadership
provided to the country by Shri P V Narasimha Rao <,,> has dealt that our
stock has risen in the international community <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#39:1:B>
A position that Kashmir <,,> is an integral part of India <,> is
once again appreciated by a <,,> very large number of countries <,,> and <w>
Pakistans' </w> efforts <,> to rake up the matter in the international meet
<,> have been tactfully <,> <O> one word </O> <,,> and <,> defeaed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#40:1:B>
So the president has unequivocally <,,> expressed the feeling of
the issue <,,> as also a determination to safeguard <,,> the integrity <,> of
the nation <,> and our preparedness to meet <O> two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#41:1:B>
When we take over <,> we at the same time do wish to express <,,> a
feeling of most cordial relations <,> with the people of Pakistan <,> with
whom we have much in common <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#42:1:B>
We hold our ground firmly on issues like Kashmir <,,> non-
proliferation treaty <,,> as a need to face the United Nation Security
Council <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#43:1:B>
Terrorism <,> and tenets of the factionalism <,> has been met
remarkably in <,,> Punjab <,,> and the government is determined to fight it
<,,> resolutely in any part of the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#44:1:B>
Donning the robes of <,,> a prosecutor <,,> Shri Jaswant Singhji
<,,> charged the government <,> and he was uncredible using the word charge
again and again sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#45:1:B>
He charged the government for not raising Hazrat Bal shrine <,,> so
that <,> the tact and patience <,> with which the government dealt with the
issue <,,> has been applauded all over the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#46:1:B>
And who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation
thereafter <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#47:1:B>
Sir but it causes agony <,> to our friend there <,> because it has
deprived them <,> of an opportunity <,,> to bake <,,> the political <,> cake
<,,> on the fire of communal frenzy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#48:1:B>
Sir <,,> we have today charted a boat <,,> which would <,> intends
to take India <,,> to the forefront of international community <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#49:1:B>
And our confidence <,> our faith in doing so <,,> eminent from our
<O> one word </O> <,,> to change with continuity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#50:1:B>
We are proud of our past <,,> and have duplicit faith in the future
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#51:1:B>
We believe <,,> in <,,> honouring <,> difference of opinion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#52:1:B>
We believe <,,> that national issues <,,> should be addressed to
<,,> in a <,,> spirit of <,> understanding and co-operation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#53:1:B>
Sir <,,> if <,,> it is narrow political considerations <,,> which
dominate our thinking on every score <,> I am afraid <,,> certain goals which
we wish to achieve <,,> may not become unachievable <,> but our <,> struggle
in achieving those would become a little adverse one <,> and if it becomes
adverse <,,> the government headed by <indig> Shri </indig> Narasimha Raoji
<,,> would remain undeterred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#54:1:B>
He would remain unflinching in his determination <,> to achieve
those goals <X>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#X55:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{> </X> <O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#56:1:B>
Indrajit Gupta </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-057#57:1:C>
We were discussing the budget just now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#58:1:C>
With the great uh <,,> uh <,,> incentives which have been provided
by the finance minister for the <,,> uh unrestricted growth of <,> of the
private sector <,> both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#59:1:C>
I am afraid this growth of black money <,,> will be further
accelerated <,> leading to more and more corruption <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#60:1:C>
This is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial
criminality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#61:1:C>
Corruption is too <,> mild term <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#62:1:C>
In some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#63:1:C>
That is what is being fostered now in our country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#64:1:C>
The <w> President's </w> address madam <,,> has consciously <,,>
consciously or unconsciously I don't know whoever prepared the address <,>
obviously did it consciously <,,> has blacked out <,,> all reference to this
<,> spreading cancer <,,> and has given no indication of the type of people
who are indulging <,> or who are in the position to indulge <,,> in this kind
of <,> financial criminality <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#65:1:C>
So on the twenty-nineth of January <,,> a front page <,,> news item
<,,> has appeared in one of our leading dailies <,> namely <mention> The
Statesman </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#66:1:C>
Giving a list of forty-two <,> people <,,> belonging to different
parties <,,> who are alleged to have been funded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#67:1:C>
I <,,> the same people the same group of people <,,> who had uh
<,,> been used by the <mention> ISI </mention> <,,> to fund the <mention>
Hizbul Mujahideen </mention> <,,> and the accused in the Bombay <,> Bomblasts
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#68:1:C>
I don't know what is the political connection I can't uh <,,>
easily find it out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#69:1:C>
But anyway <,,> this is a case there in the Supreme Court now
pending <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#70:1:C>
Their names are given in this news item along with <,> the amounts
of money which they are alleged to have received <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#71:1:C>
Among that <,,> uh major <,,> number of people come from the
<mention> Congress party </mention> <,,> than uh <,> from also from <,,> the
<mention> BJP </mention> <,,> also from the <mention> Janata Dal </mention>
<,,> also from the <mention> Janata Dal Samajwadi </mention> <,,> fewer fewer
<,> the bulk of the names are from the <mention> Congress party </mention>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#72:1:C>
Sir these are all honourable gentlemen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#73:1:C>
Most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers
some are presently minister <,,> and uh I think that a paper which <,>
publishes this kind of <,> serious type of allegation <,> should either be
proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings <,> in the court which has
not been done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#74:1:C>
Or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two <,>
should have come out publicly with some <,> denial or some contradiction <,>
which has not been done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#75:1:C>
I neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be
correct or not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#76:1:C>
But what is surprising me is you see a news report like this <,>
had created quite a lot of <,,> uh sensation <,,> and pendomonium among the
public who read these papers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#77:1:C>
But no contradictions denials or <,> defamation case or anything is
coming <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#78:1:C>
So this is very curious <,> it seems to me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#79:1:C>
And I want to draw the attention to this house that <,> the
honourable members concerned <,,> should really be more serious about this
and take uh <,> whatever necessary action they feel they should take <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#80:1:C>
But nothing has been done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#81:1:C>
So my point is <&> interruption </&> <,> that these <,,> these
cases will go on multiplying <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#82:1:C>
Not because of any individuals <,> proclamities because of what I
said there is a economic and social forces are operating <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#83:1:C>
Black money is at the root of it <,,> and black money is leading to
proliferation of this <,,> type of corruption <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#84:1:C>
And the more that spreads <,> people are thinking that well so many
people <,,> <O> two words </O> <,> whether MPs or ministers or anybody else
<,> must have <-> got </-> also got something to do with this corruption

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#85:1:C>
Is that good for the future of our country <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#86:1:C>
So I am saying that this is a matter which everybody <,> should
take seriously <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#87:1:C>
The <w> President's </w> address doesn't <,> say anything about
these things

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#88:1:C>
It doesn't <,> say anything

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#89:1:C>
It doesn't even mention <,> a big event which took place in <,>
last year <,> in ninety-three <,,> a very big event <,> which was the scam
<,> the banking scam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#90:1:C>
Is it just a small trivial matter <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#91:1:C>
Is there no mention about it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#92:1:C>
You could say that such a thing happened we set-up a <,> joint
parliamentary committee <,> the joint parliamentry committee <O> two words
</O> do it they have uh <,> submitted their report and <,,> the uh <,> prime
minister has assured parliament that <,> a follow up action will be taken
against people who are guilty and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#93:1:C>
There is no mention of the fact <,> that eight thousand <indig>
crores </indig> <,> or may be more twelve thousand <indig> crores </indig>
some people say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#94:1:C>
The Bofors is chicken feed compare to this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#95:1:C>
Bofors was only some sixty sixty-five <indig> crores </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#96:1:C>
Eight thousand to twelve thousand <indig> crores </indig> <,,>
which was <w> public's </w> money deposited in the banks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#97:1:C>
Why do public put money in the banks <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#98:1:C>
Because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the
banks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#99:1:C>
In small people also pensioners <,> small people put money in the
banks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#100:1:C>
But if <,> thousands of <indig> crores </indig> of <indig> rupees
</indig> <,,> you see <-> is </-> goes away from the back door <,> the <w>
banks' </w> <O> one word </O> <,,> virtue of a nexus <,> between brokers <,>
bankers <,> the businessmen <,> and so many types of people who are in nexus
with each other

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#101:1:C>
That money is funnelled out <,> siphoned out from the bank <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#102:1:C>
In order to go and <,,> put money in the hands of these
speculators on the <,> stock market <,,> stock exchange <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#103:1:C>
Is it a small matter ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#104:1:C>
Such a thing never happened in our country before <,,> and it <}>
<-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> affected mainly the public sector banking
system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#105:1:C>
The nationalised banks <,,> about which Indira Gandhi has spoken
at the time of nationalisation <,,> that these are going to be the real
commanding heights of the economy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#106:1:C>
Now what what is happening <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#107:1:C>
So <,> there is no mention <,,> in the <w> President's </w>
address

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#108:1:C>
So how can I thank him for this address I don't know <,,> which
completely <,,> avoids any mention of these things <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#109:1:C>
And what fate will other committees have <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#110:1:C>
If the J P C <-> is </-> report is dealt with like this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#111:1:C>
When the debate took place here in this house <,> some people were
doing their best to <,> denigrate <,> such a report to dilute it and to say
which is not of much consequence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#112:1:C>
So what will be the fate of other committees ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#113:1:C>
What will be the fate of these uh <,,> uh standing committees
which are now operating <,> which are also formed on an all-party basis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#114:1:C>
What will happen to their reports and their <}> <-> recommends
</-> <+> recommendations </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#115:1:C>
No body will bother about <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#116:1:C>
See <w> it's </w> part of our system isn't it ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#117:1:C>
<w> It's </w> part of our parliamentary system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#118:1:C>
It all depends how you look at it how much you <,> respect those
<,> institutions and how far you are prepared to <,,> carry out what they say
or not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#119:1:C>
We are in a parliamentary form of government

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#120:1:C>
If you want to have some other form of government of course it is
different matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#121:1:C>
But so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary
democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise <,>
so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#122:1:C>
<w> Thats' </w> the <-> big </-> biggest and only surviving super
power in the world today <,> is deliberately trying to <,> fish in troubled
waters <,> in Kashmir <,> and their spokesman have been coming out with so
many statements which are patently <,> anti-Indian <,> anti-Indian
sovereignity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#123:1:C>
I believe Mr Chavan has said something quite <,> <-> was </->
right <,> about this yesterday

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#124:1:C>
If <w> I'm </w> correct then I congratulate him for that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#125:1:C>
And uh <,,> it would have been better <,> if the <w> President's
</w> address had also <,> you see <,> included something about this <,>
because I want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to
think <,> that what they what the Americans are raking up is only a question
of human rights <,,> violation of human rights <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#126:1:C>
<w> That's </w> only one aspect of it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#127:1:C>
They are talking about a civil war <,,> they say civil war is
going on <,,> in Kashmir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#128:1:C>
In his <}> <-> addressed </-> <+> address </+> </}> to the General
Assembly of the United Nations the President Clinton has said it <,> that
conditions of civil war <,> are developing in Kashmir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-057#129:1:C>
Civil war is a term which has a <,> specific meaning <,,> </I>
