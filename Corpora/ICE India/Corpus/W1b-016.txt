<ICE-IND:W1B-016#4:1>
Dear Mr. Kamath, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#5:1>
While we thank you for the courtesy extended to the
undersigned  
who called on you recently at Hyderabad in company of our
<indig> Shri  
</indig> S.B. Varda and <indig> Shri </indig> Umesh Trivedi,
we are pleased  
to inform you that our team for Hyderabad has been selected
and trained for  
the launch. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#6:1>
The team includes three men duly supported by a young
lady - - all  
confident of their success at Hyderabad. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#7:1>
Their work under the guidance and field support
rendered by NuLife  
through three senior staff and your valued support in
distribution should  
yield faster results. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#8:1>
The launch date is 16th August, 1993 and we should
be there a day before the launch. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#9:1>
Details of the plan shall be revealed to you then. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#10:1>
We would need your valued support through making the
initial stocks  
through making the initial stocks available at some important
retail shelves  
so that the maiden prescriptions generated by us shall be
honoured promptly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#11:1>
We would thus request you to offer your support as
follows : 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#12:1>
1. Arrange to distribute the initial stocks at some
very important  
retail counters in both Hyderabad and Secunderabad, at least
two to three  
days before launch. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#13:1>
2. Give us a list of these retailers with addresses so
that our  
Medical representatives can effectively follow up those
chemists for sales of  
our products stocked by you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#14:1>
This would help them save on time and utilise their
time for maximum  
effective productivity. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#15:1>
3. Lists of doctors/retail chemists/institutions if
available may be  
sent to us for effective coverage.

We are in receipt of your letters No. NIL dated
12th, 15th and  
19th February, 1994. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#30:1>
We were pleased to read your communications which gave
us a market  
feel of Hyderabad. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#31:1>
As an experienced senior colleague in your team you
should keep on  
writing to us. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#32:1>
We appreciate your efforts in this regard. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#33:1>
Your working with Mr. Sriniwas as a Senior
colleague is quite <}>  
<-> alright </-> <+> all right </+> </}> since Mr. Sriniwas is
still a fresh  
candidate. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#34:1>
We are sure your demonstration of booking an order
will be emulated  
by him and he becomes more confident in his working. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#35:1>
Your initiative in working <quote> ` CENTRAL
INSTITUTE FOR  
HEARING HANDICAPPED' </quote> at SECUNDERABAD is commendable. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#36:1>
We wish you good luck in securing an order for Soliwax
from this  
Institute. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#37:1>
We are arranging to send you a special quota of
promotional aid  
and the gifts planned earlier. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#38:1>
With better movement of our pharma specialities
you should be  
able to convince M/s. Eskay Agencies to cater to additional
chemists and  
markets with the fact that we are almost 6 months in the
market. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#39:1>
We have also noted that you had helped Mr. Uma
Shanker and Miss  
Pavani by working with them and booking some of the retailers
in their area. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#40:1>
This is a very good going in keeping a team in sound
health. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#41:1>
With Nizamabad you have started going out of
Hyderabad. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#42:1>
This would also add to the productivity. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#43:1>
The next town you should now take up is Karimnagar -
another  
potential market. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#44:1>
Alternatively, we must get establishing in a big
way by the turn of this financial year. </p>

Dear Mr. Srinivas,

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#134:1>
This has reference to our earlier letter No. 1785

3. 8. 1996 addressed to you in which we have pointed out our
observations of  
your day-to-day working.

We have mentioned in <}> <-> this </-> <+> that </+>

We have not received your explanation to this letter

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-016#137:1>
Furthermore, we have not received your work
reports from July,  
1996 onwards nor there is any intimation regarding leave. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#138:1>
Non-receipt of reports clearly means that either you
are not working  
or if you are working you are not writing and posting your
work reports. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-016#139:1>
Both the things are acts of gross indiscipline. </p>

Unless we hear from your end / or meet the
undersigned in  
Hyderabad or our District Sales Manager - - MR. K. RAM REDDY
and give a

18th of
