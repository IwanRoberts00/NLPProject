<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#1:1:A>
Welcome to you <,,> from Chandigarh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#2:1:A>
This is Anu Prashantiya reporting to you from <,,> <indig>
Doordarshan </indig> Jallandhar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#3:1:A>
<w> We're </w> bringing to you now the National Lawn Tennis
Championship nineteen ninety-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#4:1:A>
The finals which are just about to be played <,,> on the Chandigarh
lawns here <,> this morning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#5:1:A>
We have there the Governor <,,> Lieutenant General Shibir sitting
there in the grey suit <,,> awaiting <,,> the players coming on to the court
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#6:1:A>
Seated next to him in the <,> black blazer <,,> is Mr Vinod Duggal
<,,> chief advisor to the administrator <,> of Chandigarh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#7:1:A>
We have the <,,> students <,,> the tennis players <,,> the ball boys
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#8:1:A>
There we have the Governor going out to the court now <,,> for the
inauguration <,> of the final <,,> accompanied by <,,> Mr Rajan Kashyap <,>
the president of the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#9:1:A>
We have the Governor now introducing himself <,> to the players <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#10:1:A>
Their is Asif Ismail <,> and Mahesh Bhupathy

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#11:1:A>
And now we have him introducing <,> to the staff and the other
members <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#12:1:A>
He is being introduced by Mr Maria <,,> Secretary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#13:1:A>
I have to introduce <,> Mr Rajan Kashyap <,> and the Governor <,,>
who are now <,,> in the process of being introduced to the players of
Chandigarh <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#14:1:A>
I think Chandigarh has <w> it's </w> <,> rare honour today <,,> of
having the National once again after almost fifteen years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#15:1:A>
Last national <,> not fifteen years <w> it's </w> about eleven
years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#16:1:A>
The last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three <,,> in
which we had <,,> Vasudevan winning the <w> mens' </w> title <,,> and <,> I
won the <w> womens' </w> <,> title here in nineteen eighty-three <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#17:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> a great <,,> day for me to be here <,,> after
winning the last national being played in Chandigarh <,,> to come here and
commentate today <,> on this <w> mens' </w> and the <w> womens' </w> singles
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#18:1:A>
The court <,,> these are the ball boys <,,> the ball girls <,,>
having a talk with the Governor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#19:1:A>
They are the trainees of C L T A as <w> I've </w> been corrected by
my <,,> fellow commentator <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#20:1:A>
I have to introduce Mr Mayan Kapoor <,,> <w> who's </w> also an
Asian <,,> former Tennis champion junior champion <,> whom I have with me
doing the Hindi commentary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#21:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> the Governor going back <,,> after meeting <,,>
all the players <,,> the students <,> the ball boys <,,> and there we have
the applause by everyone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#22:1:A>
Green grass <,,> awaits the <,,> match <,,> though nationals is now
<,,> come <,,> of an age where <,> we don't have very huge crowds watching
the nationals probably because we don't have the A T T points <,,> and we do
not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#23:1:A>
The boys here are the <,,> students who are the <,,> <w> who've
</w> come to watch the match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#24:1:A>
The huge stadium in Sector ten in Chandigarh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#25:1:A>
The students seem to be very keen <,> on this sunny morning <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#26:1:A>
I think probably the school has given them the day off to come and
watch the match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#27:1:A>
There the hills behind

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#28:1:A>
I think Chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#29:1:A>
Beautiful city with lovely weather <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#30:1:A>
And <,,> soon they have started <,> and <w> they've </w> taken lawn
tennis in a very big <,> way <,,> as they made several grasscourts at the
Chandigarh <,> Club <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#31:1:A>
And now we have <,,> the players stepping on to the court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#32:1:A>
Mahesh Bhupathy <,,> yesterday defeated <,> Nitin <}> <-> <.> Kar
</.> </-> <=> Kirtane </=> </}> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#33:1:A>
He was extended <,,> and he had won the match in three sets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#34:1:A>
And Asif Ismail beat K G Ramesh in straight sets <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#35:1:A>
Asif Ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because <,,> he just
played in the Davis Cup Match and showed great promise in Jaipur <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#36:1:A>
But he gave away under pressure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#37:1:A>
At the last minute he showed <,,> a lot of <,> talent but he could
not carry it on till the end <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#38:1:A>
Let us see <,> how he fares in the match today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#39:1:A>
The players are now warming up and uh <,,> that Asif Ismail <,,>
<w> that's </w> Mahesh Bhupaty now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#40:1:A>
Mahesh Bhupathy on your screen now <,> <&> interruption </&> much
thinner than <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#41:1:A>
Players are now getting ready for the <,> match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#42:1:A>
We have uh <,,> from the commentators box we have Asif Ismail uh
<,,> Asif Ismail <,,> serving to <,> Mahesh Bhupathy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#43:1:A>
First serve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#44:1:A>
Uhm just missed the line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#45:1:A>
Oh <,,> that was an easy shot but missed by <,> Bhupathy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#46:1:A>
Serving down the middle <,,> and the backhand uh <,,> of uh
Bhupathy <,,> and Bhupathy I think got the ball right in his stomach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#47:1:A>
Fifteen love <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#48:1:A>
Again score now is <,> thirty love <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#49:1:A>
First game first serve <,,> <O> applaud </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#50:1:A>
A lovely shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#51:1:A>
Asif <indig> ne abhi </indig> drop volley try <indig> ki lekin
</indig> drop volley was a little too <,> far back and it was very easy for
Bhupathy to reach the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#52:1:A>
There we have the action replay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#53:1:A>
You can see the crosscourt <,> it just touched the net cord <,,>
beautiful shot there by <,,> Bhupathy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#54:1:A>
Thirty fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#55:1:A>
Oh <,,> there was foul there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#56:1:A>
Let them <,,> I think both are uh <,,> at the moment in the
beginning <,,> not very well warmed up <,,> and from thirty love <,,> up <,,>
Asif is thirty O <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#57:1:A>
First first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#58:1:A>
Not a double four there by Asif I think he should <,,> so early in
the game he has had first game only two double fours <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#59:1:A>
That was a great point for Bhupathy however <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#60:1:A>
Service was a little too good for him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#61:1:A>
Asif is not serving that well <,> yet <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#62:1:A>
<w> He's </w> capable of much better service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#63:1:A>
Much much slower <w> he's </w> serving today <,,> <w> that's </w>
deuce <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#64:1:A>
That was a well played point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#65:1:A>
After sent it went right upto th net <,,> <w> that's </w> what he
should be doing after his service <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#66:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig> service <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#67:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> advantage point <,,> foul for service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#68:1:A>
I think <indig> abhi tak koi <,,> accha </indig> point <,> one has
not seen except one <,,> crosscourt forehand <,> <w> that's </w> the replay
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#69:1:A>
<&> In Hindi </&> <w> he's </w> not showing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#70:1:A>
Advantage again to Asif <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#71:1:A>
There <,> <w> he's </w> taken the first game Asif <,,> by a good
<,,> service <,,> down the line from the backhand court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#72:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> one love <,> Asif <w> Ismail's </w> <,> first
game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#73:1:A>
Inspite of three double faults Asif has been able to foiled this
game <,,> that shows that uh <,> Bhupathy has not <,,> really fought into
this game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#74:1:A>
And uh <,,> we are finding Asif looking back because <,> <w> what's
</w> not on the screen is that the Governor is leaving <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#75:1:A>
And we have the replay <,,> of the point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#76:1:A>
Service which is down the line <,,> and <,> Asif is still watching
<,,> the Governor and everyone leaving <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#77:1:A>
Now we have the <,,> second game of the match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#78:1:A>
<w> We're </w> going to watch Bhupathy serving <,,> to Asif Ismail
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#79:1:A>
I was just having a talk with the <,,> administrator of Chandigarh
<,,> the advisor to the administrator <,,> and I was <}> <-> given to be </->
<,,> <=> given to </=> </}> understand that C L T A the tennis complex is
located in about three hundred <indig> acre </indig> <,,> green park <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#80:1:A>
And there we have uh <,,> Bhupathy serving his first serve <,,>
foul <,> <w> that's </w> right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#81:1:A>
Oh <,,> Asif is trying for that four hand down the line

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#82:1:A>
But I guess he was standing up too straight for that shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#83:1:A>
He needed to bend down <,,> because the net is usually a little bit
higher on the sides <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#84:1:A>
One needs to get down lower on <w> ones' </w> knees <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#85:1:A>
<w> That's </w> fifteen love <,,> to Bhupathy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#86:1:A>
Fourth first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#87:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a good variation in service from Bhupathy <,,> a
kind of a spin <,,> but however well vanished by Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#88:1:A>
We have that lovely passing shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#89:1:A>
Makes it fifteen <,,> all two three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#90:1:A>
We don't find much of excitement

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#91:1:A>
Nobody is out there to try to break service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#92:1:A>
Thirty fifteen <,,> fourth first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#93:1:A>
That was a <,,> service return a bit too higher by Asif Ismail
making it very easy for Bhupathy <,> to put that volley away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#94:1:A>
<w> It's </w> very important in these points in return of service
to keep the ball low <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#95:1:A>
And that game point <,,> came to Bhupathy <,,> an easy service game
there at forty fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#96:1:A>
Which makes it three games all <,,> first set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#97:1:A>
We find <,,> the usual <,,> crowd is also very quite <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#98:1:A>
Players are also <,,> lacking the enthusiasm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#99:1:A>
I think this game has uh <,,> still to <,> heat up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#100:1:A>
Oh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#101:1:A>
What <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#102:1:A>
Fifteen love <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#103:1:A>
<w> There's </w> that replay of the shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#104:1:A>
<w> There's </w> a just a little <,,> bit out I thought <,> and
<w> there's </w> a disagreement on that point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#105:1:A>
The linesman is just sitting quietly <,,> and <w> that's </w>
Bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but I think <w> there's </w> not
true really <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#106:1:A>
Simply <,,> <w> it's </w> a long argument there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#107:1:A>
Fifteen love <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#108:1:A>
Oh ho that was a nice <,,> return there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#109:1:A>
I think uh <,,> Asif Ismail a little too early there that he play
<,,> is that <,,> put away <,,> very decisively but too close <,,> was
Bhupathy <,> and he got that return <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#110:1:A>
Fifteen O <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#111:1:A>
Got first service <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#112:1:A>
Oh <,> that was a lovely put away there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#113:1:A>
Besides his forehand crosscourt volley <,,> by Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#114:1:A>
<w> There's </w> that <,,> top spin service an easy volley <,>
because the ball was so high <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#115:1:A>
I think the boys have to look forward to making their return of
service much better <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#116:1:A>
Thirty fifteen <,,> Asif <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#117:1:A>
First first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#118:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a very good shot return <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#119:1:A>
Wonderful passing shot there by <,,> Asif Ismail that was I think
the longest rally in the match today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#120:1:A>
<w> There's </w> that action replay <,,> he had to run back to get
<,> that log <,> and there <w> he's </w> extended to the other end of the
court <,> and here we see the final passing shot <,> the beautiful backhand
down drive by Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#121:1:A>
So Asif serving forty fifteen <,> on his service <,,> first first
service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#122:1:A>
Oh ho <,,> there quick return there by Bhupathy <,,> taking Asif
<,> into an unforge terrain <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#123:1:A>
<w> There's </w> the replay again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#124:1:A>
<w> He's </w> rushing into the court and <w> he's </w> just caught
on unaware this hits in the middle of the <,,> body line shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#125:1:A>
Still <,> in its point to go for the game for Asif Ismail <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#126:1:A>
All first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#127:1:A>
Beautiful shot return there by <,,> Bhupathy <,,> a wonderful
forehand <,,> down the line passing shot on Asif service <,> which makes it
deuce now <,,> for the players <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#128:1:A>
A chance <,,> there that <,> wonderful shot once again you can see
how well he converted his back hand <,,> and he went quickly <,,> before <,,>
Asif could reach the leg <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#129:1:A>
<w> It's </w> deuce <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#130:1:A>
Oh ho that was lucky <,,> that was really lucky <,,> high backhand
volley <,,> <w> there's </w> that service and <w> that's </w> the high <,>
backhand volley <,> just touch the tip of the net and dropped off there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#131:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> call a lucky shot at the right time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#132:1:A>
Advantage <,> Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#133:1:A>
Oh <,,> he didn't <,,> really concentrate on that one it was not
that difficult a shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#134:1:A>
That was a lovely service <,> a very good backhand volley
crosscourt <,,> returned by <,,> Mahesh Bhupathy <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#135:1:A>
And watch that service on the corner and <w> he's </w> right up at
the net <,> <w> that's </w> the game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#136:1:A>
Oh <,,> beautiful shot there by <,,> Asif Ismail a wonderful
backhand crosscourt <,,> return <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#137:1:A>
<w> He's </w> right up at the ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#138:1:A>
There is <,,> look at that stretching <,> backhand volley <,,> and
that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#139:1:A>
At the <O> one word </O> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#140:1:B>
Fifteen

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#141:1:A>
Fifteen thirty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#142:1:A>
<w> Bhupathy's </w> service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#143:1:A>
Uh just missed <,,> that was a lovely try by Asif Ismail <,> going
out for one of his <,> big backhand <,,> crosscourt return to service but he
just missed the line <,,> and that gives <,,> a chance <,> to Bhupathy to
equalise the points <,> at thirty all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#144:1:A>
First first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#145:1:A>
Oh lovely offensive lot there <,,> a beautiful shot <,,> touch of
mastery there by Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#146:1:A>
That was a <,> <w> there's </w> the replay <,,> and you could see
the stretched backhand <,> volley <,> return <,,> and <w> that's </w> <,,>
the defensive lot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#147:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the break point <,,> for Asif <,> Asif Ismail

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#148:1:A>
The first break point <,,> in the match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#149:1:A>
Oh <,,> a double fall there gives Asif Ismail <,,> the much needed
break <,,> at the right time coming also <,,> which gives him a five three
lead <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#150:1:A>
<w> That's </w> Asif Ismail forty love <,,> the second game of
second set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#151:1:A>
Oops that was a <,,> unforge terror there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#152:1:A>
Lucky shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#153:1:A>
But <w> he's </w> got a good lead there <,> <w> that's </w> the
shot <w> we're </w> showing you again on screen <,,> and <w> he's </w> trying
to drop volley <,,> but unsuccessful <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#154:1:A>
The boys are running there on the court <,> so Asif <,> chooses
not to start his service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#155:1:A>
These students <,,> have to be asked to sit down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#156:1:A>
The screen is not showing it but the <,> players are being
disturbed <,,> because the children are moving at stadium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#157:1:A>
To come back on court <,,> childern have now <,> by and large
settled down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#158:1:A>
<w> That's </w> how Asif regaining <,> forty fifteen <,,> up <,,>
and love one <,,> for his second set <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#159:1:A>
Oops <,,> try to block that volley Asif Ismail <,,> but I think he
did not <,,> put his racket <,> down <,> just let flat straight out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#160:1:A>
Still in the lead Asif Ismail <,,> serving forty thirty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#161:1:A>
All first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#162:1:A>
Beautiful <,> crosscourt backhand <,,> by Mahesh Bhupathy <,,> at
the right time also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#163:1:A>
<w> There's </w> that wonderful crosscourt <,,> backhand <,,>
return of service <,,> which makes a deuce <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#164:1:A>
All first service <,,> I think <indig> us </indig> break <indig>
ke baad </indig> <w> he's </w> lost his concentration <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#165:1:A>
Second service <,,> double faults <,,> so forty love <w> there's
</w> an advantage now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#166:1:A>
I think this uh taking this game <,,> too easy is <,> could
provide to be very risky for Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#167:1:A>
<w> There's </w> a break point now <,> for the second time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#168:1:A>
<w> That's </w> it <,> there is the break <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#169:1:A>
There is the break which needed which Bhupathy was looking for
<,,> Mahesh <,,> up two love <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#170:1:A>
Forty love <,,> he was leading <,> and there <,> there he lost his
concentration <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#171:1:A>
First first service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#172:1:A>
<w> It's </w> <,,> a very <,,> weak return of service there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#173:1:A>
Fifteen love second service <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#174:1:B>
Just a minute <,,> just about

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#175:1:A>
Asif Ismail is hardly showing any <,,> the serve in the game

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#176:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-019#177:1:A>
At the wrong time <&> in Hindi </&> if continues to do this
any further <w> he's </w> already one game down <,,> his service is lost <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#178:1:A>
He can't afford to take it uh <,> easy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#179:1:A>
Beautiful service there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#180:1:A>
Oh lovely passing shot there down the line <,,> by Asif Ismail
that shows <w> he's </w> <,,> a man capable of class <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#181:1:A>
Thirty fifteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#182:1:A>
A good <,,> service there <,> in backhand pass corner of Asif
Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#183:1:A>
And Bhupathy is with the safe lead over <,,> in third game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#184:1:A>
The move is set <,,> <w> it's </w> going to be difficult for Asif
Ismail now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#185:1:A>
Next second service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#186:1:A>
Oop <,,> facing the sun Bhupathy trying to <,,> give a smash <,,>
there was a miss hit there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#187:1:A>
Bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty <,,> on his service
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#188:1:A>
A decisive volley there <,> gives him three love leads <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#189:1:A>
I think this uh set is going to be little difficult <,> might <,,>
<w> there's </w> the return of service you can see this <,,> defensive
backhand <,,> crosscourt volley <,,> Bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in
this game <,,> which which a player <,> even tries to bring up his game <,,>
at a certain depth <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#190:1:A>
But now he should <,,> so <w> that's </w> love five <,,> Asif
Ismail serving <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#191:1:A>
A beautiful service <,> down the forehand corner <,> by Asif
Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#192:1:A>
Down the line winner there <,,> making it fifteen all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#193:1:A>
His service lacked <,,> depth <,,> which is very easy to go for
the down line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#194:1:A>
Thirty all <,,> no <,> fifteen all there <,,> and I think the
students are moving again and disturbing Asif Ismail <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#195:1:A>
Good service <,,> but I don't find Bhupathy at all stretching <,>
himself <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#196:1:A>
This was an easy ball <,> he could have stretched himself and
tried for a winner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#197:1:A>
<w> He's </w> standing there <,,> not even trying to move his left
leg to move <,,> movements are so slow <,> <w> that's </w> an out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-019#198:1:A>
Thirty all <,,> </I>
