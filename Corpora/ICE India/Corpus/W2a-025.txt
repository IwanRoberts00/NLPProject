The absorption difference and comparative absorption
spectrophotometry of praseodymium ( III ) complexes with ligands having
varying binding sites ( <*> beta</*>-diketonates, haloacetates,
fluorccarboxylates, fluorosulphate, trifluoromethane sulphonates, diols,
bipyridine and ortho-phenanthroline ) , have clearly shown that the
non-hypersensitive <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>

3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions, exhibited substantial sensitivity towards even
minor changes in the immediate coordination environment around praseodymium (
III ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#5:1>
We have given the name Ligand Mediated Pseudohypersensitivity to such
an observation and referred these transitions as pseudohypersensitive
transitions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#6:1>
The different structural and binding characteristics of these ligands
in terms of the coordinating power of the donor sites, denticity, normalized

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#8:1>
The complexation of lanthanides brings enhancement of the
intensity of hypersensitive transition up to 200 times greater than that of
corresponding lanthanide aquo ion<sp>1</sp>; however, the intensities of
other transitions have rarely been found to be larger than those of aquo ion
and sometimes even less<sp>2.3</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#9:1>
During the course of our work on several complexes of structurally
different ligands, we have observed that the binding characteristics of
different ligands apprehensive transitions of lanthanides.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#10:1>
The transitions <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>

4</sp>F<sb>3/2</sb> in Nd ( III ) are such that they do not follow selection
rules for quadrupole transition; yet these showed substantial sensitivity
towards even the minor changes in the immediate coordination environment
around corresponding lanthanide ion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#11:1>
We have given the name ligand mediated pseudohypersensitivty
for such observation and considered these transitions as
pseudohypersensitive transitions<sb>4.5a</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#12:1>
The present work reports the ligand mediated
pseudohypersensitivity of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>2</sb>; <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>

1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions of Pr ( III ) and utilized the magnitude and
variation of the oscillator strength ( P ) and Jodd Ofelt electric dipole
intensity ( T<*>lambda</*> ) parameters in complexes of Pr ( III ) (
haloacetates, fluorocarboxylates, <*> beta</*>-diketonates, diols and

<h> <bold> 2 Results and Discussion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#15:1>
Praseodymium ( III ) an f<sp>2</sp> ion, is the simplest lantha
nide ion with f electron and with the stable oxidation state in aqueous and
non-aqueous media; it is not widely studied as compared to Nd ( III ) and Eu
( III ) with f<sp>3</sp> and f<sp>6</sp> configurations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#16:1>
Actually JuddOfelt theory works less satisfactorily for Pr ( III )
as compared to other lanthanides<sp>6.7</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#17:1>
The calculation of P of 4f-4f transitions gives substantially high
root mean square values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#18:1>
The <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> - > <sp> 3</sp>F<sb>2</sb> transition of
Pr ( III ) , occurring around <*> aproximate-sign</*> 5200 cm<sp>-1</sp>,
follow selection rules for quadrupole transition and hence behaves as
hypersensitive transition, but it is not generally studied in solution
spectral analysis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#19:1>
Peacock found <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>2</sb> and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions showing substantial sensitivity in
phosphomolybdates and phosphotungstate<sp>8</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#20:1>
Significant variations of electric dipole intensity (
T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb> ) where <*> lambda</*> = 2,4,6 specially T<sb>2</sb>
parameter, have been shown for several solution spectral studies
involving lanthanides in different coordination compounds<sp>9.10</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#21:1>
Siddal and Stewart<sp>11</sp> on the other hand reported the <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 1</sp>I<sb>6</sb>, transiton to be
hypersensitive which was strongly contested by Peacock<sp>8</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#22:1>
In order to explain the anomalous behaviour of Pr ( III ) , Carnall
<it> et al </it> , <sp> 6</sp> and Weber<sp>12</sp> put forward a theory
which considered certain assumption made in Judd-Ofelt theory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#23:1>
The assumption considers the perturbation configurations degenerate
and these lie <O> <&> page </&> 160 </O> at higher energies than 4f-4f
transitions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#24:1>
The inclusion of odd part of intensity expression improves the
interpretation of Pr ( III ) absorption spectra intensity slightly.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#25:1>
In <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>2</sb>, <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>1</sb>, <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> multiplets, the <*> lambda</*> = 5
reduced matrix elements are non zero.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#26:1>
It may be possible then that T<sb>5</sb> may be contributing to the
intensity at <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>2</sb> and
<sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb>, because the <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>2</sb> and <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> multiplets have <*>
lambda</*> = 5 reduced matrix values <*> approximate- sign</*> 0.283 and
0.502, while for <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb>
multiplet <*> lambda</*> = 5 has zero value.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#27:1>
But if this is the interpretation, the discrepancies in the values of
P would then be more in <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>2</sb> transition observed by Peacock<sp>8</sp> and also by
us<sp>5b.13.14</sp>, thus, cannot be explained on this argument.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#28:1>
Peacock<sp>8</sp> considered the exceptional behabiour of Pr ( III )
hypersensitivity, as one of the major problem in the lanthanide f-f
intensity theory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#29:1>
This appears most probably to be the reason why very few absorption
spectral studies have been made on Pr ( III ) complexes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#30:1>
Peacock<sp>8</sp> experienced difficulty in getting a good fit
between the observed and the calculated values of <w> P's </w> of various
transitions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#31:1>
Our procedure using partial and multiple regression
method<sp>13-17</sp> has yielded very good agreement between observed and
calculated P of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>2</sb>
and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>2</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions,
while marginally overestimated values were found for <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb>
<*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> and marginally underestimated
values<sp>13.14.15.16.17</sp> were found for <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*>
arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#32:1>
The RMS deviations in <w> P's </w> of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*>
arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*>
<sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> transitions computed by our method<sp>4.10.14</sp>
were of much smaller magnitude than those observed by Peacock<sp>7.8</sp>
and Tandon and Mehta<sp>9</sp>. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#33:1>
An examination of <w> Carnall's </w> coefficients for U<sp> ( 2 )
</sp> shows, that these are nearly equal in case of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb>
<*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*>
<sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> bands, hence these bands should have almost the same
intensity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#34:1>
The intensity of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> band is always found to be larger than that of <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#35:1>
One way of making <w> P's </w> of <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*>
arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*>
<sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> transition equal, is to equal the net intensity
difference ( <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> )
<*> arrow</*> ( <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> )
by giving a positive factor, a correction factor T-or we can use a negative
correction factor T<sb>8</sb>( <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> ) <*> arrow</*> ( <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>1</sb> ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#36:1>
We feel it is too early to say, which one of these approaches is
the correct one.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#37:1>
However, as experced, the introduction of these correction factors,
eliminated some of the discrepancy in the values of P of praseodymium( III )
4f-4f transitions and tried to make T<sb>2</sb> positive, but we do not want
to say with definiteness, till the natureof T<sb>7</sb> and T<sb>8</sb> is
known with certainty.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#38:1>
No doubt the introduction of T<sb>7</sb> and T<sb>8</sb> lowers the
RMS deviation between observed and calculated values of oscillator strengths
of different 4f-4f transitions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#39:1>
We are working in detail to find out the feasibility of these
correction parameters by applying to a large number of spectra of Pr( III )
complexes both in solid state as well as in solution<sp>4,5c</sp>. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#40:1>
The values of T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb> parameters have been found
to consist of both vibronic and static part.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#41:1>
The T<sb><*>ambda</*></sb> parameters, as phenomenologically
obtained, are a combination of T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb> due to static and
vibronic perturbation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#42:1>
The variation of T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb> with environmental changes,
can be determined by crystal field parameter A<sb>t,p</sb>, which in turn
depends upon the position ( angular disposition and distance ) and charges of
the surrounding ligands.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#43:1>
For lanthanides other than Pr ( III ) , the T<sb>2</sb> varies
enormously with the environmental changes around metal ion, while
T<sb>4</sb> and T<sb>6</sb> are almost insensitive to the environment, making
thus the intensities of non-hypersensitive transitions of little use in
solving structural problems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#44:1>
These 4f-4f transitions are weakly allowed, due to some mixing
of the excited states of opposite parity into the ground state, as a result
of configuration interacions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#45:1>
This small mixing may be increased on complexation, if the energy
of the excited state is lowered.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#46:1>
Additional intensity may be gained, by mixing of ligand and metal
wave functions due to orbital overlap, with the result that the intensity of
the hypersensitive transition increases substantially.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#47:1>
The introduction of covalency in the metal-ligand bond improves the
possibilty of mixing of the states of opposite parity, which is required for
relaxing the rules for f-f transitions and thereby leading to the
intensification.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#48:1>
Iftikhar<sp>18</sp> has recently observed the high intensification of
hypersensitive transition which he ascribed to eigen perturbation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#49:1>
He, however, could observe only marginal intensification in
non-hypersensitive transitions<sp>18</sp>. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#50:1>
During the course of present work on Pr ( III ) complexes, it
is observed, that though <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>2</sb>, <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp>
3</sp>P<sb>0</sb> <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>0</sb>
and <sp> 3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions
are not hypersensitive in orthodox sense, yet these exhibit high
intensification and wide variation of oscillation strength.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#51:1>
These undergo changes under the inference of the structural
features and bonding characteristics of the ligands.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#52:1>
The complexes investigated belong to the ligands with widely
differing binding features; fluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphates,
trifluoromethane sulphonate, <*> beta</*>-diketonates, diol
derivatives; phenanthroline and bipyridine.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#53:1>
These complexes range between essentially outer sphere
complexes to predominantly inner sphere complexes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#54:1>
The complexes belonging to similar ligands have been placed and the
data on <w> P's </w> and electric dipole Judd-Ofelt T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb>
parameters along with energy interaction <O> <&> page </&> 161 </O> (
F<sb>k</sb>, E<sp>k</sp> ) , nephelauxetic ( <*> line over beta </*> )
bonding ( b) and covalency ( <*> delta</*> ) have been considered, for
interpreting the coordination environment around praseodymium ( III ) ,
extent of involvement of metal 4f orbitals and degree of outer sphere-inner
sphere coordination. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#55:1>
The fluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphates, trifluoromethane
sulphonates, diol derivatives, and <*> beta </*> -  diketonates of
praseodymium ( III ) all involve oxygen as coordinating sites.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#56:1>
All involve either bidentate or dimeric bridging attachment of
ligands in their crystalline derivatives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#57:1>
The ortho-phenanthroline and bipyridine complexes of praseodymium
indicate the presence of nitrogen environment around praseodymium ( III ) .
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#58:1>
<h> <bold> 2.1 Fluorocarboxylates of praseodymium ( III ) </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#59:1>
The fluorocarboxylates of praseodymium ( III ) of the type Pr (
OOCR ) <sb> 3</sb> where R = CH<sb>2</sb>F, CHF<sb>2</sb>, CF<sb>3</sb>,
C<sb>2</sb>F<sb>5</sb>, C<sb>3</sb>F<sb>7</sb> and C<sb>6</sb>H<sb>4</sb>F
and fluorosulphate Pr ( OSO<sb>2</sb>F ) <sb> 3</sb> and trifluoromethane
sulphonate Pr ( CF<sb>3</sb>SO<sb>3</sb> ) <sb> 3</sb> provide immediate
coordination environment comprising oxygen donor sites of these fluoro
ligands.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#60:1>
In case of fluorocarboxylates, the presence of three coordinated
water molecules provides non-coordinated environment around
praseodymium, while fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate involve
octacoordinated praseodymium as a result of polymeric nature of these
compounds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#61:1>
The energy interaction and the nephelauxetic ( <*> line over
beta</*>, b<sb>1</sb> <*> delta</*> ) derived from the observed energies of
the transitions, show that there are significant changes in coulombic (
F<sb>k</sb>, E<sp>k</sp> ) parameters, computed from the spectra recorded at
pH <*> aooroxinate-sign</*> 2.0 and pH <*> approximate-sign</*> 6.0,
sugests that at pH <*> approxinate-sign</*> 6.0 these fluorocarboxylates,
fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate moleties become far
better ligands.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#62:1>
In fluorocarboxylaes themselves, as the number of fluorine in the
alkyl group increases, the acid strength of acid increases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#63:1>
The increase in the acidic strength of the ligand contributes
towards the decrease in the nephelauxetic effect and bonding parameter in
their praseodymium ( III ) complexes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#64:1>
Fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate involve most
probably tetrameric unit with oxygen bridges of the trifluoromethane
sulphonate and fluorosulphate group most probably involving
octacoordinated praseodymium( III ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#65:1>
These dissolve in dimethyl sulphoxide and water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#66:1>
In water these give weaker 4f-4f bands with substantially lesser
magnitude of nephelauxetic effect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#67:1>
Thus in these compounds both components A<sb>tp</sb> ( t, odd ) of
the following equation appear to contribute towards the intensity of
4f-4f transition and magnitude of T<sb><*>lambda</*></sb> parameters as
shown below by equation of Judd<sp>19</sp>: </p> <O> equation </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#68:1>
In fluorocarboxylate derivatives themselves the oscillator
strength of 4f-4f transitions vary significantly specially for <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 3</sp>P<sb>2</sb> and <sp>
3</sp>H<sb>4</sb> <*> arrow</*> <sp> 1</sp>D<sb>2</sb> transitions which are
pseudo-hypersensitive in nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#69:1>
The increased number of fluorine substituent appears to contribute
towards decrease in the intensity of f-f transition as well as lowering of
the nephelauxetic effect, bonding and covalency parameters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#70:1>
This is understandable in view of the increased electron withdrawing
power of different fluoroalkyl groups CH<sb>2</sb>F <*> greater than</*>
CHF<sb>2</sb> <*> greater than</*> CF<sb>3</sb> <*> greater than</*>
C<sb>2</sb>F<sb>5</sb> <*> greater than</*> C<sb>3</sb>F<sb>7</sb> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-025#71:1>
Comparing the energy and intensity data of these
fluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate
complexes of Pr ( III ) in water and dimethyl formamide and dimethyl
sulphoxide, we find substantial changes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#72:1>
The aqueous solution spectra yield weaker 4f-4f bands and smaller
magnitudes for nephelauxetic and bonding parameters, but these values are
substantial as compared to that observed for Pr ( III ) aquo ion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#73:1>
In dimethylformamide, however, the lowering of coulombic (
F<sb>k</sb>, E<sp>k</sp> ) , nephelauxetic parameter ( <*> line over beta</*> )
is substantially greater while values of bonding ( b) and covalency ( <*>
<it> b</it></*> ) parameters increase significantly and thus pointing
towards increased incidence of covalency as a result of different
coordinating power of dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide molecules.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#74:1>
Borina<sp>20</sp> has very recently reported that even in the solvent
composition 50 : 50 water-DMSO the inner coordination shell of
praseodymium consisted of dimethyl sulphoxide and this resulted in the
isolation of [ Pr ( DMSO ) <sb> 8</sb> ] <sp> 3+</sp>.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#75:1>
However, we have found that even in the solvent composition 80 : 20
DMSO : water, the octa solvated complexes do not exist; only mixed solvato
complexes of the type [ Pr ( DMSO ) <sb> x</sb> ( ligand ) <sb>
y</sb>]<sp>3+</sp> could be isolated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-025#76:1>
Even in pure dimethyl sulphoxide / dimethylformamide slowly the
anionic ligands from inner coordination sphere move to the outer sphere
coordination, finally yielding octacoordinated solvent comlex of
praseodymium ( III ) . </p> </I>
