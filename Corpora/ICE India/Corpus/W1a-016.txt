<I> <O> Q.1a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#1:1>
<h> <ul> Need for planning in business </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#2:1>
Planning decides the future course of action in orderly manner.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#3:1>
Business planning means using the techniques of planning in the
business operations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#4:1>
Business includes all the activities from production to marketing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#5:1>
This <-> all </-> process of business must be done in orderly and
organised i.e in <}> <-> systamatic </-> <+> systematic </+> </}> manner.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#6:1>
Business without planning would not bring desired effects or would not
achieve the objectives of a business in fairly manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#7:1>
The main objectives of a business ( every ) is to survive in the
market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#8:1>
Growth & expansion & recognition & to create prestige in the market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#9:1>
If business is carried out without planning it will not bring desired
results but will <}> <-> definitly </-> <+> definitely </+> </}> bring
undesirable results.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#10:1>
Planning decides the future course of action of business by <}> <->
consider </-> <+> considering </+> </}> all factors, which can be <}> <->
influence </-> <+> influenced </+> </}> <}> <-> the </-> <+> by </+> </}>
action.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#11:1>
Planning helps <ul> the business in the following <}> <-> way. </->
<+> ways. </+> </}> </ul> </p> <&> serial numbers 1) to 3) are on the left
margin </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#12:1>
1 Planning ( proper ) first analyses <del> or </del> the problem
in the business correctly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#13:1>
Planning decides or finds the <}> <-> seviorty </-> <+> severity </+>
</}> of the problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#14:1>
How that particular problem will be solved ?

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#15:1>
How <}> <-> theat </-> <+> that </+> </}> problem will affect the
business activities etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#16:1>
Then, <ul> planning decides the objective </ul> of a business by
determining or stating clear objective.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#17:1>
<}> <-> planning </-> <+> Planning </+> </}> helps the workers or
employees to achieve that object by cooperation, co-ordination.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#18:1>
If the <}> <-> worker </-> <+> workers </+> </}> or employees know
the object of the business correctly and in clear way they can work easily
<del> and </del> or in particular way to secure the object. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#19:1>
<h> <ul> 3 Planning premises </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#20:1>
Planning also includes same <}> <-> assumption,s </-> <+> <w>
assumption's </w> </+> </}> i.e. electricity will be there to work the
machine etc.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#21:1>
Thus, planning decides what to do, How to do, when to do and who
is to do it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#22:1>
Thus, planning answers the four questions <+> : </+> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#23:1>
1) What to do, i.e. what is the object of business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#24:1>
<}> <-> What </-> <+> Which </+> </}> business wants to achieve.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#25:1>
Why we are working ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#26:1>
2) How to do ?

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#27:1>
Planning also <}> <-> answer </-> <+> answers </+> </}> this question
i.e. <}> <-> In </-> <+> in </+> </}> what manner, procedure we should
achieve the object of the business decided in answer <quote> what to do
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#28:1>
3 <}> <-> then </-> <+> Then </+> </}> proper planning also
decides the time or period or proper time to the proper action in <}> <->
deiding </-> <+> deciding </+> </}> the object and also answers the question
<quote> who will do it </quote> i.e. to achieve the goal of a business
<quote> who will do the particular work, act etc. </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#29:1>
Thus, if the business is carried out without the planning answer
to all the above <}> <-> question </-> <+> questions </+> </}> will not be
given <quote> which are the important questions </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#30:1>
<del> and </del> And because the employees or workers will not be
knowing why business is carried out i.e <+> the </+> object.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#31:1>
Proper procedure & time for action and the work specialisation will
not be possible and business will not work efficiently, smoothly and main
objects of every business i.e to make profit <+> will be lost </+> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#32:1>
<}> <-> survival </-> <+> Survival </+> </}> in the market growth,
recognition, status et <del> will </del> cannot be achieved because of
absence of planning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#33:1>
So for smooth working of business proper planning should be there
from the production to marketing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#34:1>
Because <+> of </+> planning we can come to <ul> know where we are to
where we want to go. </ul> </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.1 b) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#35:2>
<h> <ul> <quote> " Profit is the primary objective of a business"
</quote> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#36:2>
<ul> Yes. </ul>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#37:2>
In <-> the </-> <w> today's </w> world market profit is the primary
objective of business but not the only objective of business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#38:2>
All business activities are aimed at making the profit or to earn
maximum profit.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#39:2>
The main objective of all business is to maximise the profit by
reducing the cost of production.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#40:2>
The main purpose or goal of <-> a many </-> business is to earn
maximum profit.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#41:2>
But there are some organisations or <}> <-> institution </-> <+>
institutions </+> </}> which are carried out for social <}> <-> objective.
</-> <+> objectives. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#42:2>
In the past profit is the main, primary, i.e. very 1st but also the
only objective of business, the producers or manufacturers only aims at
maximising profits through <}> <-> explotation </-> <+> exploitation </+>
</}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#43:2>
<}> <-> Theey </-> <+> They </+> </}> did not bother about the social
<}> <-> effectes </-> <+> effects </+> </}> or objectives of the business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#44:2>
They only <}> <-> wants </-> <+> want </+> </}> to earn profit.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#45:2>
But <w> today's </w> world market is a consumer oriented<+>,</+> all
the activities are carried out for the consumer.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#46:2>
This does not mean that the aim of <w> today's </w> business
organisation is to earn <}> <-> profit. </-> <+> profit alone. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#47:2>
Today also the primary<->,</-> objective of business is to make
maximum profit but this is not <-> a. </-> only objective of business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#48:2>
Thus in <w> today's </w> market producers earn profit but they are
certainly not allowed for <-> a </-> profiteering.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#49:2>
They also <}> <-> performs </-> <+> perform </+> </}> secondary
object i.e. social object because <del> organisation </del> ( business ) is
an economic organisation & social <}> <-> instiution </-> <+> institution
</+> </}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#50:2>
<}> <-> This, </-> <+> Thus, </+> </}> profit must be main & the
very first objective of a business because without profit <}> <-> not
business </-> <+> no businessman </+> </}> can survive in the market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#51:2>
Thus, for surviving, growth and <}> <-> expanssion </-> <+> expansion
</+> </}> profit must be primary object of the business but not a
profiteering.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#52:2>
<}> <-> That </-> <+> The </+> </}> people <del> will </del> <}> <->
definatly </-> <+> definitely </+> </}> will not allow to earn
extra-ordinary, profit by exploiting consumer, & workers.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#53:2>
Thus, it is true & correct to have a profit as the primary objective.

<I> <O> Q.4) a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#54:3>
Business combinition means simply combining the units which <del>
arey be </del> <+> were </+> engaged in a same production activity or which
may be in different production <}> <-> line. For </-> <+> line for </+> </}>
some common interests.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#55:3>
The business combinition means <quote> come together and become one
part of the business </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#56:3>
Thus, business combinition means combining the units to take
advantage or for a common goal, interest etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#57:3>
<h> <ul> Causes of business combinitions </ul> : - </h> <&> serial
numbers 1) to 10) are on the left margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#58:3>
<h> 1) <ul> Avoiding cut-throat <}> <-> compitition </-> <+>
competition </+> </}> </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#59:3>
Many business units come together to avoid cut-throat competition
and also a <}> <-> wastefut compitition </-> <+> wasteful competition. </+>
</}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#60:3>
<}> <-> thus, </-> <+> Thus </+> </}> it helps to the small
organisation to survive in the market by joining the other business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#61:3>
Unnecessary and unhealthy <}> <-> compitition </-> <+> competition
</+> </}> are <}> <-> westfut compitition </-> <+> wasteful competition. </+>
</}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#62:3>
<}> <-> they </-> <+> They </+> </}> do not help any <}> <->
compititior, </-> <+> competition, </+> </}> therefore, business combination
takes place. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#63:3>
<h> 2) <ul> price-cutting policy </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#64:3>
If there are <}> <-> nuber </-> <+> a number </+> </}> of
business units carr<del>ng</del>ied out same business in the same market
price-cutting is <}> <-> eaisly </-> <+> easily </+> </}> done.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#65:3>
Because, consumer gets the substitute and the value of every item can
<}> <-> eaisly </-> <+> easily </+> </}> be <}> <-> bargain. </-> <+>
bargained. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#66:3>
Thus, by combining units they may decide to charge the uniform prices
to <}> <-> avoide </-> <+> avoid </+> </}> the price cutting.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#67:3>
<h> 3) <ul> To create monopoly </ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#68:3>
Monopoly business has got several advantages.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#69:3>
So all the procedures <}> <-> aims </-> <+> aim </+> </}> at creating
monopoly by combining different units into one unit.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#70:3>
Thus, by creating monopoly producers are free to charge any price.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#71:3>
<h> 4) <ul> Growth, <}> <-> expantions </-> <+> expansion </+> </}>
</ul> : - </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#72:3>
By combining the units, one big organisation can <-> be </-> take
place and to that one big organisation growth and <}> <-> expanssion </-> <+>
expansion </+> </}> of business is possible, in order to raise funds,
increasing production capacity, etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#73:3>
<h> 5) <ul> Preference or desire for bigness </ul> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#74:3>
Big organisation has got some special status or many <}> <-> produers
</-> <+> producers </+> </}> like to have or they desire for big
organisation therefore they join the others. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#75:3>
<h> 6) <ul> Specialisation of work </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#76:3>
Work specialisation is possible in big organisations because of
number of workers work there.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#77:3>
By specialisation of work quality of product can be improved. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#78:3>
<h> 7) <ul> Expert management </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#79:3>
Expert management of business or planning of business
transactions through experts is possible only in big firms.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#80:3>
As they can afford to pay the expert to manage or to plant their
business activities. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#81:3>
<h> 8) <ul> Credit <}> <-> worthyness </-> <+> worthiness </+> </}>
</ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#82:3>
Credit <}> <-> worthyness </-> <+> worthiness </+> </}> is more
in case of big organisations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#83:3>
Banks or many financial institutions are ready to give credit to big
organisations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#84:3>
Thus, raising the finance is not a problem in case of big
organisations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#85:3>
They can also raise the finance from the profit earned previously.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#86:3>
<h> 9) <ul> Economies of large scale production </ul> : </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#87:3>
Every <}> <-> businessmen </-> <+> businessman </+> </}> desires or
wants to enjoy large scale production ( Economies ) .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#88:3>
By combining units it is possible to produce, <}> <-> distributes
</-> <+> distribute </+> </}> on large scale and to enjoy the economies of
large scale production such as discount on purchasing raw material, credit
facilities etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#89:3>
<h> 10) <ul> Trade cycles </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#90:3>
The risk involved in a big organisation is big or more but it is
devided to many number of workers, employees or shareholders.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#91:3>
Therefore, individual only suffer the loss, to his extent and the
burden of loss or risk do not fall on few members or persons.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#92:3>
And business organisations ( big ) can easily <}> <-> feight </-> <+>
fight </+> </}> with the trade cycles i.e. inflation, <}> <-> Depression,
</-> <+> depression </+> </}> in the market, Govt policies etc. </p>

<p>

<I> <O> Q.5) a) </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#94:4>
<h> <ul> <quote> " Locational planning is an important aspect of
business planning" </quote> </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#95:4>
Business planning means <quote> using planning techniques in the
business activities </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#96:4>
<}> <-> profitability </-> <+> Profitability </+> </}> and efficiency
of business <-> is </-> mainly depends upon the location of a plant i.e.
<mention> where the plant or organisation is situated, established </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#97:4>
<}> <-> if </-> <+> If </+> </}> it is not situated in a proper place
or region then it will <}> <-> definatly </-> <+> definitely </+> </}> fail
to bring the desired effects or to achieve the goals.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#98:4>
Therefore, while preparing the planning or <del> while </del>
location factor must be considered i.e <mention> where or which is the proper
place to start the business </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#99:4>
Because if the location is not considered in the planning <del> and
</del> though the planning is very good but planning will also fail to bring
the desired effect.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#100:4>
Thus, it is an essential item to be considered while preparing the
business planning.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#101:4>
Thus, location is a very important factor or aspect of business
planning.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#102:4>
Because, planning <+> is </+> done <}> <-> with </-> <+> without
</+> </}> taking into account location <+> it </+> will <}> <-> defete </->
<+> defeat </+> </}> the purpose of planning. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#103:4>
<h> <ul> Regional factors </ul> </h> <&> serial number 1) to 6) on
the left margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#104:4>
<h> 1) <ul> nearness to the raw materials </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#105:4>
Organisation or business must be situated at the place where the
<del> loca </del> raw materials of or production can easily <+> be </+>
available.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#106:4>
If the business is situated far from the source of raw material it
will increase the production cost.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#107:4>
Thus if while making the plan if <del> prod </del> location factor
would not <}> <-> consider, </-> <+> be considered </+> </}> it will increase
the cost of production. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#108:4>
<h> 2) <ul> nearness to the market </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#109:4>
<}> <-> business </-> <+> Business </+> </}> should be situated
near or not very far from the market <}> <-> becase </-> <+> because </+>
</}> if the business is situated far from the market it will increase the
distribution cost. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#110:4>
<h> 3) <ul> Transport facilities </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#111:4>
The business should be situated in a place where transportation
facilities are well developed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#112:4>
If the transportation facilities are not developed in the region
where the business is situated it will <-> make </-> delay in bringing raw
material, distributing the finished goods to market etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#113:4>
<h> 4) <ul> Availability of labour </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#114:4>
While planning, the <}> <-> planer </-> <+> planner </+> </}>
should also consider the location because if the business is situated where
the labour supply is not <}> <-> adquate </-> <+> adequate </+> </}> or not
sufficient and also not cheap then it will not <+> be </+> desirable.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#115:4>
Therefore, business must <+> be </+> situated where the <del> nat
</del> labour supply is <}> <-> adquate </-> <+> adequate </+> </}> and
cheap. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#116:4>
<h> 5) <ul> Availability of natural resources </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#117:4>
Material resources must be available mainly water, where the
business is to be <}> <-> start </-> <+> started. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#118:4>
<}> <-> if </-> <+> If </+> </}> the natural resources are not
available in the region adequately or sufficiently the business will not work
<}> <-> smooth </-> <+> smoothly </+> </}> & efficiently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#119:4>
6) The main and v<del>a</del>ery important factor while planning
the business <-> and </-> with reference to the location is the location of
business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#120:4>
<+> It </+> must be in proper place where the organisation or
industry can easily <}> <-> through </-> <+> throw </+> </}> out <}> <-> it
</-> <+> its </+> </}> pollutants - - items like water, <?> noise, then air
pollution </?> etc., in <}> <-> safety way but </-> <+> safe way </+> </}>
without harming anybody.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#121:4>
<}> <-> OR </-> <+> The </+> </}> industry should not be situated in
a place where it cannot <}> <-> through </-> <+> throw </+> </}> out the
items ( pollutants ) <}> <-> safetly becase </-> <+> safely because </+> </}>
they are harmful <}> <-> in </-> <+> to </+> </}> the health of the people.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#122:4>
<h> <ul> locality </ul> </h> <-> 1) </->

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#123:4>
The business should be situated in the proper locality i.e.
according to the nature of product and <del> acco </del> the living standard
or style of living of people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#124:4>
For <ul> example </ul> : If the car manufacturing industry or T.V.
manufacturing industry is situated or starts the business in <}> <->
villeges, </-> <+> villages </+> </}> it will <}> <-> definatly </-> <+>
definitely </+> </}> not be proper <}> <-> becase </-> <+> because </+> </}>
the living standard or knowledge or the importance for the product of the
people in village is <del> not </del> low i.e. they do not afford to buy this
luxurious items.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#125:4>
And <}> <-> becase </-> <+> because </+> </}> they do not afford
they do not have any importance or need for that product. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#126:4>
Thus, while preparing or in the process of business planning
location factor is very important otherwise if <}> <-> planer neglect </->
<+> planner neglects </+> </}> or do not consider the location factor it will
bring some problems or undesirable effects which are harmful to the business
such as, increase in cost of production, distribution, delay in production
and distribution of finished goods, labour scarcity, insufficient natural
resources ie. unfavourable climate conditions, <+> which are </+> harmful to
people <}> <-> becase </-> <+> because </+> </}> of pollution, and also
wastage.

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#127:4>
<}> <-> if </-> <+> If a </+> </}> business is not situated in a
proper place i.e. scarcity of consumers or extra expenditure to increase or
create demand for product. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#128:4>
Thus locational planning is an important aspect of a Business
Planning. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.5 b) </O>

<h> <ul> Advantages of good plant layout </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-016#130:5>
Plant layout means planning or arrangement of machinery,
equipment etc., in proper or orderly manner. </p> <&> serial numbers 1) to 4)
are on the left margin </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#131:5>
1) Plant layout helps in smooth working and efficient working in

<ICE-IND:W1A-016#132:5>
2) Speedy production can <-> be </-> take place <}> <-> becase </->
