exchange rate <,,> and the market exchange rate <,,> in the market itself in
Delhi itself <,> whatever the intelligence report you may be receiving <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#2:1:B>
But actually sir the market exchange <,> the market is seeing all
<,> the <indig> hawala </indig> market is going on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#3:1:B>
But if black money which is being created in this country <,> is
being siphoned out <,> and uh <,,> the <indig> hawala </indig> market they
are having their own fare <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#4:1:B>
So therfore may I know from the honourable minister last <,,> after
the convertability how many cases you have really identified or seen <,> how
many uh uhm <,> cases have been registered <,,> and how much <,,> foreign
currency you have recovered from this dealer <,,> ?

like <,> <}> <-> legally </-> <+> legal </+> </}> import of gold <,,> legal
import of silver <,,> and some <,> security convertability <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#6:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#30:1:C>
And also sir <,,> <w> it's </w> a <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#31:1:A>
He was asking how many cases <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#32:1:C>

Under Fera itself since nineteen <,> in August nineteen
ninety-two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#35:1:B>
The exchange rate also

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#36:1:C>
Yes sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#37:1:B>
Market exchange rate also

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#38:1:C>
Yes I can tell you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#39:1:C>
Upto twenty <,> seven three <,,> uh ninety-three sir <,> <{> <[>
right <,> we have booked fourteen cases sir <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#40:1:B>
<[> Right </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#41:1:C>
And if you want me each case individually and each amount
involved I can <{> <[> tell you sir </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#42:1:B>
<[> No no don't want </[> </{> that is enough

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#43:1:C>
And also sir <,> the market exchange rate <,> sir <,,> in <,>
in February <,,> ninety-two <,,> upto <,,> February ninety-three <,,> the
market exchange rate upto the date was <,> in February ninety-three it was
twenty-six point two zero sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#44:1:C>
In February ninety-two the <,> March ninety-two it was twenty-five
point eight nine sir actually <,> and also <,> the Bombay <indig> hawala
</indig> market rate sir as we could <,> uh collect the information it was
<,> only thirty-four <,> thirty-four <indig> rupees </indig> in the <,>
February ninety-three sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#45:1:C>
Just <w> it's </w> <,,> premium in percentage <w> it's </w> only
twelve percent sir

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#46:1:C>
And <,,> in March nineteen <,> ninety-three sir <,> the percentage
of premium in <indig> hawala </indig> rate it has come down to <,> ten point
seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#47:1:C>
In April <,> it has come down to ten point four <,> and against <w>
it's </w> a big rise slight rise in <,> eighth of April it is eleven point
four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#48:1:C>
Now on sixteenth April it is eleven point six sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#49:1:B>
Relevance

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#50:1:C>
Yes <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#51:1:B>
Sir <,> if within <,> that the <,> actual market rate is now
eleven point some <,,> eleven point six

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#52:1:C>
No it is the percentage of premium market

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#53:1:B>
It is the percentage <w> that's </w> the gap <w> that's </w>
there and <w> that's </w> the gap that attracts the <,> <{> <[> no no <,> the
the <,> black marketists to go to the <indig> hawala </indig> market instead
of going <,> coming to the open market <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#54:1:C>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#55:1:B>
That is the speculative <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#56:1:B>
So <w> that's </w> why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever
you have <,> announced <,> that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold
field <,> that has that is some impact <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#57:1:B>
But actually the <indig> hawala </indig> market <,,> as is being
reported <,> everyday in the newspaper that <indig> hawala </indig> market is
going on and going on in a full speed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#58:1:B>
And the <,> the objectives <,> whatever you have announced during
this kind of liberalisation <,> and all this things has no meaning at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#59:1:B>
And number two sir <,,> the Fera Act <,> of section eight and
section <,> section nine the custom officers have said <,> it contradicts
against the specifications <,> contradict the Fera Act itself

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#60:1:B>
And that also gives the <,> handle <,,> for <indig> hawala </indig>
market to operate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#61:1:B>
May I know from the honourable minister that whether it has <,>
brought to his notice by the custom officials that this Fera Act section
eight and section nine <,> of the Fera Act <,> is being contradicted by the
notification of R B I for which the <indig> hawala </indig> market is a
negotiator

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#62:1:C>
Sir <,,> I don't agree with the honourable member <,> the
<indig> hawala </indig> rate <,> is on the increase sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#63:1:C>
It has certainly come down <,,> and with the government measures
even the <,,> these administrative measures <,> it has kept smuggling <,> and
it has made smuggling under <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#64:1:C>
And the second objective of these measures <,> to <,> prevent the
all transactions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#65:1:C>
I don't say it is totally wiped out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#66:1:C>
It is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#67:1:C>
But the government is making sincere efforts <,> to put an end to
such clandestine operation <&> interruption </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#68:1:A>
Mr Moghe

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#69:1:C>
But about this sir Fera Act <,> sir <,,> as we are aware sir
<,> the Fera Act <,> or the amendment we have recently <,> uh been introduced
very recently sir <,> and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on
<indig> hawala </indig> trade sir <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#70:1:D>
<&> A few words in Hindi </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#71:1:C>
Sir and the present <,,> Act under the Fera <,,> the persons
who are <,> involved in such transactions <,,> they are detained under Fera
<,,> and a <O> two words </O> and even then

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#72:1:D>
There <O> a few words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#73:1:C>
Yes there is a provision sir <,> yes yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#74:1:A>
Mr Moghe please <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#75:1:D>
<&> A few words in Hindi </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#76:1:C>
Sir <,> as I have already pointed out <,> <indig> hawala
</indig> case being a clandestine operation <,> <w> it's </w> very difficult
to <,> <.> amo </.> estimate the amount quantum of <indig> hawala </indig>
trade <,> and <w> it's </w> very difficult to <,> decide on the revenue
collections and other <,> uh monitory <,> item <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#77:1:A>
<indig> Shree </indig> Nirmal Kanthji

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#78:1:D>
<&> A few words in Hindi </&>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#79:1:E>
He is entirely right <,,> that it is a clandestine operation
from which uh <,> uh for the people will reap all the benefit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#80:1:E>
Uh the question is <,,> that uh <,,> you had <,> you had you had a
committee to estimate black income <,,> which was entirely <,,> clandestine
<,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#81:1:E>
Why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate <,> of
how much transactions take place <,> in the <indig> hawala market </indig>
<,,> number one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#82:1:E>
Number two <,,> you have you say <,> that the <}> <-> <.> ra </.>
</- > <=> rate </=> </}> of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on
these transactions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#83:1:E>
Imagine the rate <,,> that is being given here <,> it is an
astronomical rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#84:1:E>
Does it means <,> that the real value of the <indig> rupee </indig>
<,> is that <,,> that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of
returns <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#85:1:E>
And <O> a few words </O> <,> there <-> we </-> will be no <indig>
hawala </indig> market <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#86:1:E>
If there is full convertibility which <,,> the I M F is desiring of
Dr Manmohan Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#87:1:E>
Just now it is convertability <,> on the trade account only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#88:1:E>
You say it is a full flaw <,,> and there we have no <indig> hawala
</indig> market at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#89:1:E>
Is there any proposal in the mind of <,,> Dr Manmohan Singh <,> to
go into that so that at one stroke <,> the <indig> hawala </indig> case <,>
is completely eliminated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#90:1:E>
And a whole structure in it <,> that these illegalities in the
foreign exchange trade <,> are taking place <,> not only to the unorganised
sector of <indig> hawala </indig> trade <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#91:1:E>
And you have indulge you have not <,> made any CBI enquiry <,> to
find out who were the people <,> who are connected <,> who are connected with
those who are arrested directly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#92:1:E>
Many important people in Bombay and others <,> are involved <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#93:1:E>
But apart from that <,> your foreign exchange bank <,> foreign bank
<,> we are their hope so <,> and not to account <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#94:1:E>
Through which as we have discovered it <,> <{> <[> Mr Nirmal
Kanthji <,> it is not violating it is going out

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#95:1:A>
<[> Mr Nirmal kanthji </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#96:1:A>
Its becoming a long speech <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#97:1:E>
I am not giving a speech sir

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#98:1:A>
Yes it is becoming

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#99:1:E>
Hope to account then not to account also <,> to that also how
much money is going out

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#100:1:C>
Yes <,> <}> <-> <.> cons </.> </-> <=> constitution </=> </}>
of the country <,,> to access the <,,> uh <indig> hawala </indig> trade <,,>
<w> it's </w> a suggestion <,> and at present <,,> the government has no set
proposal sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#101:1:C>
And <,> regarding the <,,> as I already said <,,> the government
is making very sincere efforts <,,> putting down such <,> transaction <,,> by
making some <,,> administrative by taking some administrative measures <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#102:1:C>
And <,> strictly enforcing <,,> all existing clause <,> Fera
forty-four A <,> TADA and other <,,> uh like uh under the <,,> <,,> <}> <->
<.> co conva </.> </-> <,> <=> covered </=> </}> under the <,,> uh
transaction sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#103:1:C>
And <,> as I have already pointed out sir <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#104:1:A>
But it is a little too much <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#105:1:C>
He has pointed out <&> interruption </&> how many percent
<,,> we have <,,> taken action in Bombay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#106:1:C>
We have taken in action on several persons in Bombay <,> Madras
Bangalore <,> and even in Delhi <,,> who have violated this <,> and Hyderabad
<,,> and <,,> and even <,,> who have violated <,> operated most of accounts
also sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#107:1:C>
And this <indig> hawala </indig> transaction as I pointed out
earlier sir <,> was mainly operated through earlier <,,> and gold smuggling
number two is silver smuggling <,> and third is underinviting and
overinviting sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#108:1:C>
As the government has taken very serious view of situation

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#109:1:C>
We are making very sincere <,> efforts to put down this

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#110:1:F>
<indig> Ama </indig> how many cases you have <{> <[> <O> one
or two words </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-060#111:1:C>
<[> You will get </[> </{> the find out this

<ICE-IND:S1B-060#112:1:C>
I have already said <,> </I>
