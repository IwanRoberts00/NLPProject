Uh <,> I mean we do that <,> over a span of two years <,> the
second year and the third year

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#13:1:A>
Uhm <,> so your basic specialisation is actually literature

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#29:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#30:1:B>
Teaching well we start from the <,> middle ages <,>
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#31:1:B>
So we start with Harbeley and <,,> uh <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> we go

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#32:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#33:1:A>
<[2> Uhm uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#37:1:B>
Madame Bowary <,> <{> <[> oh <,> this this uh <,,> well known
author

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#38:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#39:1:A>
Uhm <,,> uh alright coming to your evening courses in the
certificate of proficiency course <,> uh what is the text book you are
following <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#40:1:B>
Uh we have this book called uh <foreign> <mention>
Alize<*>e-acute</*>s de francais </mention> </foreign>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#41:1:A>
<foreign> <mention> Alize<*>e-acute</*>s de francais
</mention> </foreign> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#42:1:B>
Yeah <,> <w> it's </w> a <w> it's </w> a <w> it's </w> a a
very recent uh <,> book <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#43:1:A>
Uhm uhm <{> <[> they stated all the new methods </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#44:1:B>
<[> Taken in </[> </{> all the new methods and did well <,>
but uh <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> it is a good book

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#45:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#46:1:A>
Good book

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#47:1:B>
Good book yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#48:1:A>
Is it one <{> <[> book for the </[> entire certificate

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#49:1:B>
<[> No <w> it's </w> the three </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#50:1:B>
<w> It's </w> no <w> it's </w> uh <,> yeah entire certificate
is one book <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#51:1:B>
I mean we have three <,> uh three volumes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#52:1:B>
The <{1> <[1> first one </[1> second one third one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#53:1:B>
So those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced
<{2> <[2> diploma </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#54:1:A>
<[1> Oh you have </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#55:1:A>
<[2> Advanced </[2> </{2> diploma

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#56:1:B>
So we don't always uh <,> finish the entire book itself

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#57:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a little too much

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#58:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#59:1:B>
So we say about the <,> three fourth of the the book we do
with the C O P <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> then we continue with the diploma

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#60:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#61:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#62:1:B>
Three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the
third book uh <,> the second and the third book uh <,> for the advanced
diploma

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#63:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#64:1:B>
Of course we supplement it with <,> our own materials <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#65:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#66:1:B>
What is the book uh you follow for <,> uh Russian ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#67:1:A>
Uh you see we have several text books available but <,> uh I
normally use uh <,> a book called <foreign> <mention> Russki yuzik dlya vsekh
</mention> </foreign> that means you know <mention> Russian for everybody
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#68:1:A>
<w> It's </w> called <mention> Russian for everybody </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#69:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a whole set of books actually <,> it has one text
book

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#70:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#71:1:A>
And there is one latest stock <,> so a lot of conversation <,>
jokes <,> anecdotes <,> they are all there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#72:1:A>
Then a book of exercises <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#73:1:A>
These excercises they normally do at home

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#74:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#75:1:A>
Then we also have a book called <,> you know <,> <mention>
Reader </mention>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#76:1:B>

Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#77:1:A>
Uh <foreign> <mention> KNiga dlya chte<*>e- acute</*>niya
</mention> </foreign> this is a book <,> there are some stories etcetera
there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#78:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#79:1:A>
They read it like <,> non-detailed text

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#80:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#81:1:A>
Plus there is a <,> small dictionary <,> which gives all the
words which are used in the text book and all these books <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#82:1:A>
Plus there is one small reference grammar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#83:1:A>
Now this grammar <,> uh explains all the grammar used in <,> you
know lesson-wise again

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#84:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#85:1:A>
So <,> that way <w> it's </w> a nice compact one <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#86:1:B>
Yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#87:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#88:1:B>
It it has <,,> uh uh book meant for the teacher <,> guide for
the teacher

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#89:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#90:1:B>
And uh it has a book of exercises <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> like as
you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#91:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#92:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#93:1:B>
And uh <,> there is a casette which goes with all <,> the
lessons in those <,> uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there
are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#94:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#95:1:B>
Then which is not always very convenient because when we have
a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole
casette is <,> uh <w> it's </w> quite difficult <,> so

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#96:1:B>
Our set also goes with a casette but it is optional

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#97:1:B>
Sometimes casettes are available <,> sometimes they are not
available <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#98:1:B>
But when they are available they are very useful

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#99:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#100:1:A>
So that way <,> if there is a casette then you don't even
need a teacher
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#101:1:A>
You can really learn the whole thing from the text book <,> from
the <,> whole set

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#102:1:A>
You see it is a set which is very useful it is good <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#103:1:A>
I like that very much <,> but in fact I started this thing only to
ask you about this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#104:1:A>
The problem we face is <,> there are good text books like this uh
<,> <mention> Russian for Everybody </mention> <,> but they are simply not
available <,> now because of the Soviet <{> <[> Union <O> one word </O> and
all </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#105:1:B>
<[> Yeah nor did our books </[> </{> <,> uh our books are not
available either because uh <,> I mean they are available but uh <,> they
cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred <indig> rupees </indig> each
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#106:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#107:1:B>
Which is uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#108:1:A>
Very high

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#109:1:B>
Too high <,> <-> students </-> can't expect students to buy
them at all

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#110:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#111:1:B>
So what we do is we get them xeroxed <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#112:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#113:1:B>
Means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed <,> those we
pick out exercise which <,> can be done by the students

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#114:1:B>
We get them uh <,> typed photo copies <,> <{> <[> uhm uhm <,> just
a few of them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#115:1:A>
<[> Uhm uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#116:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#117:1:B>
And uh <,> the others we do in class

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#118:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#119:1:B>
But the book as such we get it xeroxed <,> the main book <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#120:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#121:1:B>
And uh that it works out much cheaper than <,> buying the
book

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#122:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#123:1:B>
Means cost about eighty <indig> rupees </indig> to get <,>
<.> the </.> them xeroxed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#124:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#125:1:B>
I think okay <,> only thing you miss out of the colours and
uh <,> means there is a lot of play on colours etc., in the <,> in the book
<,> pictures <,,> full of pictures you lose out on all that <,> you know
without uh <,> with the xeroxed copy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#126:1:A>
Uhm <,> always this is the greatest problem we are facing

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#127:1:A>
We just can't buy books they are simply not available <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#128:1:A>
Library of course has several copies <,> but then these are all
part time students <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> so we cannot give the books to them
from the library <{> <[> if they take and if they don't return </[> <,> <w>
it's </w> a terrible problem

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#129:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#130:1:B>
<[> In fact they are not even among uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#131:1:B>
Yeah they can sit and <,> read it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#132:1:A>
Right they can sit but at home you <}> <-> required </-> <+>
require </+> </}> a text book when you are learning

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#133:1:A>
So <,> text book <{> <[> has a </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#134:1:B>
<[> So what </[> </{> have you been doing <,> uh have you
been xeroxing them or uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#135:1:A>
With some great difficulty last year we could get uh <,> a
couple of books for some students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#136:1:A>
So they were even sharing books like uh <,> one book for two
students <,> whatever was available <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#137:1:A>
I don't know what will happen next year <,> next year

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#138:1:B>
Can't you get xeroxed copies <,> I mean uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#139:1:A>
Now xeroxing the whole set or whatever <,> you know there are
lots of pictures <,> photos etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#140:1:A>
And you cannot avoid it because uh <,> you know photos are <,> are
going with the text <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#141:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#142:1:A>
So every thing is <,> uh text is there photographs are there
<,> pictures are there <,> diagrams are there <,> all these things are there
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#143:1:A>
And if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become
very expensive <,> extremely expensive <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#144:1:B>
Or may be you could <,> uh may be get out some copies from
the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#145:1:B>
Not let them take them home <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#146:1:A>
But if they don't <{> <[> return </[> <,> if they don't
return means it will

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#147:1:B>
<[> But uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#148:1:B>
Ha no <,> you don't allow them to take it home

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#149:1:B>
You allow them to read them in class

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#150:1:A>
But at home

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#151:1:B>
Atleast in class they will have a book <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#152:1:A>
But they <,> badly require a text book at home <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> how will you do the exercise <,> how will you study <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#153:1:A>
You have to kind of <,> after going home you have to revise your
lessons <,> you must read what has been taught in the class

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#154:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#155:1:B>
Yes exactly <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#156:1:A>
So you have to have the text books

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#157:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> a great problem we are now facing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#158:1:A>
I don't know what will be done in future maybe <{> <[> <w> they'll
</w> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#159:1:B>
<[> But </[> </{> couldn't you have chosen <,> uh some other
book which <{> <[> is uh or </[> readily available

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#160:1:A>
<[> Now the other </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#161:1:A>
The reason uh <,> problem now is that in fact no book is
available <,,> not a single book is available <,> even those which are
popular

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#162:1:B>
Not even Wagner is it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#163:1:A>
<.> Wa </.> even Wagner which is published in Delhi <{> <[>
and which is not available now </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#164:1:B>
I thought Wagner was available in uh <,,> in uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#165:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#177:1:B>

yeah <,> Russian

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#178:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#179:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#180:1:B>
But for the C O P we found it was uh <,> too <,> too <?>
authentic </?> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#181:1:A>
Uhm <,> it is <,> it is like an encyclopaedia

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#182:1:B>
<w> It's </w> like an encyclopaedia <w> it's </w> <,> uh <w>
it's </w> like a dictionary

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#183:1:A>
How exactly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#184:1:B>
With a list of words which are very difficult to learn by
heart and specially long Russian words which are impossible to remember

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#185:1:A>
<w> It's </w> full of words words words words <w> it's </w>
like <O> one word </O> <,> <&> in Telugu </&> <,,> and then actually <,> when
we were planning this <,> there was one problem I was thinking about <,> I
thought I will discuss this with you because you know you teach French and I
teach Russian <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#186:1:A>
I also read some French <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#187:1:A>
I did two years of French here <,> uh Tutkar taught me <,> Shastri
taught me <,> sometime Nelu also taught me for sometime <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#188:1:A>
Anyway <,> and you read some Russian <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#189:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#190:1:A>
See one observation I made always was <,> while doing this
French <,> and while teaching Russian <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#191:1:A>
You know my observations are based on uh <,,> not only just my
first hand experience <,> but also <,> looking at the syllabi <,> various
Universities <,> I know the <,> syllabi of uh <,> Nagpur University <,> uh
Poona University <,> <w> I've </w> seen <,> uh even <w> J N U's </w> <,>
syllabus <,> our own syllabus <,> of Osmania University I know very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#192:1:A>
What I <,> somehow you know see is <,> that in the French courses
<,,> there is some what uh of you know <,> uh a little more uh emphasis on
the <,> oral skills <,> speaking skills <,,> where as the written part <,>
somehow gets slightly diluted <,> <w> it's </w> not <,> uh taught in such a
nice fashion as the oral skills are taught <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#193:1:A>
In the Russian <,> it is the other way round <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#194:1:B>
Yeah <{1> <[1> there is </[1> emphasis on the <.> wri </.> on
<{2> <[2> the written <,> uh yes </[2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#195:1:A>
<[1> In Russian </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#196:1:A>
<[2> On the written skill </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-060#197:1:A>
Yeah <,> in the Russian classes <,,> uh you see we <}> <->
given </-> <+> give </+> </}> them so many exercises they go on <,> doing
them like mathematics <,,> so they are very good at reading and writing <,,>
they write well <,> they answer questions they do exercises <,> but when it
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking
like this in <,> uh among people <,,> they are so shy of doing it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-060#198:1:A>
They can't do it <,> Russian students somehow just can't speak
Russian <,> whereas French students I feel when they write they <,> uh commit
quite a number of mistakes you know <?> lots </?> of mistakes <,> but when
they speak they are so fluent you know <,> they just <,,> very fluently speak
<,> even among themselves <,> even when nobody is watching even when there is
absolutely no need for it <,> I feel French students you know <,> uh they
love to speak French <,> </I>
