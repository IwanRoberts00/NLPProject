Principal <,,> Madavee <,,> <indig> Shri </indig> <,> Suresh  
Pendse <,,> who has been <,,> put in a <,,> position of <,,> eminence <,> in  
a most unexpected manner <,,> Dr Shastri <,,> Prof Pradhan <,,> <indig> Shri  
</indig> <,,> Dhuri <,> who is sitting just below me on the right hand side  
<,,> and <indig> Shri </indig> Tatyasaheb <,> Patwardhan or Tatya Patwardhan  
if not Tatyasaheb <,,> and <,,> members <,,> of the resource person team <,,>  
members of the staff of the English department of this college <,,> and <,>  
fellow participants <,,> in this <,,> two day seminar <,,> on <,,> the method  
or methods of teaching <,,> or trying to teach <,,> varieties of English <,,>  
to the twelfth standard <,> boys and girls <,> who happen to join our college  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#2:1:A>
When Prof <,,> Uppar <,,> it may be pronounced as upper also you see  
<&> laughter </&> that also is there <,,> saw me in my residence at Bombay  
<,> and showed me the letter of the principal 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#3:1:A>
I said see I am most innocent <,> into bracket ignorant <,> of the  
subject matter of your discussions or participations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#4:1:A>
On my great teacher later on <w> I'll </w> have his I have something  
to say about him <,> uh Dr V K Gokak <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#5:1:A>
Uh it was said of him that he had <,> a first <,,> in English we  
don't say first class <,> we say first <,> means first class <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#6:1:A>
In English language and literature in the university of Oxford in  
the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#7:1:A>
And I matriculated in nineteen forty <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#8:1:A>
And Karmveer Bhaurao sent me <,> to this great teacher in Sangli  
<,,> and I was a little student <,,> with a Gandhi cap <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#9:1:A>
When I <,> first told that our sir had got a first class in English  
language and literature <,> I didn't understand the distinction between the  
two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#10:1:A>
Later on <,,> I came to know <,> what literature was <,> and what  
language is <,> or is likely to be <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#11:1:A>
And being a teacher of English for <,,> nearly twenty-three or  
twenty-four years <,,> I was never in charge of teaching grammar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#12:1:A>
My <,> acquaintance with English is through Tarkhadkar translation  
number one <,> number two <,> number three <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#13:1:A>
Perhaps you do not know who Tarkhadkar was <,,> ? <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#14:1:A>
Or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when  
one was quite enough <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#15:1:A>
A <w> Kale's </w> lesson in English translation Rao was <w> Kale's  
</w> younger brother <,> Satara <,> R R Kale <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#16:1:A>
<w> Kale's </w> lessons in English translation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#17:1:A>
So I matriculated as I said in nineteen forty so our <,> <-> method  
of </-> methodology of teaching English at Satara <,> was to put it very <,>  
roughly <,> very crude <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#18:1:A>
But having come into contact <,,> your Principal said Prof Patil is  
a living example I hope it is still living <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#19:1:A>
And as I was telling my old friend Suresh Pendase <,> in the bus in  
the car that <,> he was so kind enough to place at our disposal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#20:1:A>
I received letters from my friends <,,> Barrister P G Patil  
<mention> Ajeev Sevak Rayat Shikshan Sanstha </mention> Satara <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#21:1:A>
Now the word is <indig> aajeev sevak </indig> <,,> they said  
<indig> ajeev sevak ajeev </indig> means <indig> nirjeev </indig> <,,> <&>  
laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#22:1:A>
And if by looking at me if he <,> has that idea I wouldn't quarrel  
with him <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#23:1:A>
So <,,> this <,,> literature <,,> the horizon of literature was  
open before us <,,> in that small college with a population of a <,,> its  
enrollment was Dr Shastri <,> I myself don't believe <,> when I joined Sangli  
<,> Willingdon college Sangli Gokaksaheb who had come from Oxford <,,> the  
strength was three hundred and fifty <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#24:1:A>
All four classes of Arts <,> and two classes of upto inter-science  
<,> six classes <,> three hundred and fifty <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#25:1:A>
And the professors were about thirty-five 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#26:1:A>
That means <,> per every professor ten students which is a good  
good quota I see <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#27:1:A>
And as I said Dr Gokak came from Oxford <,> trailing clouds of  
glory do we come from Heaven <,> from God who is our home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#28:1:A>
Now I am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#29:1:A>
I had these two lines <,> young men and women <,> are from  
Wordsworth <mention> Ode On Intimations Of Immortality From Recollections of  
Early Childhood </mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#30:1:A>
This is the mouth feeling type <,> <mention> Ode on Intimations of  
immortality from recollections of early childhood </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#31:1:A>
And there Wordsworth <,,> is developing the thesis of <indig>  
samadhi </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#32:1:A>
When we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul <indig>  
samadhi </indig> <,,> uh don't think about <indig> samadhi </indig> because  
you are very young men and you not bother about that just now <,> <&>  
laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#33:1:A>
And there is a famous stanza which begins with <,> where these  
lines occur <,,> <quote> Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting <,> The  
soul that rises with us <,> our <w> life's </w> Star <,> Hath had elsewhere  
it setting and cometh from <,> from afar <,> Not in entire forgetfulness <,>  
And not in utter nakedness <,> But trailing clouds of glory do we come from  
God who is our Home <,> Heaven lies about us in our infancy <,,> Shades of  
the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy <,> And he sees it in  
his joy <,> Until at last the vision fades far away <,> Into the light of  
common day </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#34:1:A>
Now I have quoted about ten or twelve lines <,,> which I heard from  
<,,> the lips of my great teacher <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#35:1:A>
When I was sitting on the very first bench <,> that was my only  
distinction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#36:1:A>
Sitting on the first bench <,,> because sometimes <,> Mr president  
our one of our teachers in Sangli was <,> not speaking loudly enough <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#37:1:A>
So I said sir <,,> you are not being audible even on the first  
bench <,,> whereas our teacher said <,,> and the principal the <,> Dr Shastri  
has allowed me <,,> the free use of Marathi language occasionally <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#38:1:A>
So he said <,,> you can't hear me ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#39:1:A>
I said no sir <,> I can't hear <,,> <&> in Marathi </&> <&>  
laughter </&> <&> in Marathi </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#40:1:A>
A man who thinks about this <?> filling </?> things etcetera <,> he  
has missed his way in the college <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#41:1:A>
So Dr Gokak this is how we see he used to 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#42:1:A>
And Dr Gokak never stood on one spot <,> on the platform <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#43:1:A>
He used to move from one end of the platform to the other 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#44:1:A>
Those of you who have visited Sangli Willingdon college you know  
that F Y Arts class <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#45:1:A>
And in those days Dr Shastri as you know <,> the professors had to  
wear a dark gown <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#46:1:A>
Town and gown <,> town and gown this is a <,,> a terminology from  
the university of Oxford and Cambridge <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#47:1:A>
Town means people from the city <,> and gown means people <,>  
students from the university <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#48:1:A>
Town and gown <,,> that has become very brown now <,> so uh that is  
<,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#49:1:A>
And so Dr Gokak <,> used to play with us <,,> as if we were little  
children in the family <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#50:1:A>
He used to engage two periods in the F Y Arts classroom which <,>  
which principal would engage F Y Arts students or P G students <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#51:1:A>
I understand these days principals don't bother to take any class  
at all <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#52:1:A>
I hope you see this <,,> time dishonour rule does not obtain in  
this college <,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#53:1:A>
Because basically <,,> uh I was so happy to know that your  
principal gets a salary of eight thousand <indig> rupees </indig> <,,> <&>  
laughter </&> eight thousand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#54:1:A>
And when I started teaching in Sangli uh Satara under Karmveer  
Bhaurao <,> my salary per month after B A London Bar at Law was seventy-five  
basic and forty-five days allowance <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#55:1:A>
This is Arabian Nights stories <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#56:1:A>
<-> B A Bar at Law </-> <,> B A London Bar at Law salary <-> one  
hundred </-> one hundred and twenty <indig> rupees </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#57:1:A>
This fellow should be sent to the Yeroda or mental home <,,> <&>  
laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#58:1:A>
And when uh <,> Dr Shastri was saying uh <,> sir what about <w>  
vice-Chancellor's </w> pay I was getting two thousand rupees as V C <,,>  
vice-Chancellor V C <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#59:1:A>
But the work was so difficult that rather then be V C I went to W C  
<,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#60:1:A>
And my salary at that time was two thousand <indig> rupees </indig>  
and income tax and other tax cut <,> I use to get fourteen hundred <indig>  
rupees </indig> <,> per month <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#61:1:A>
But money is neither here nor there 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#62:1:A>
What what salary <,> did Karmveer Bhaurao get <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#63:1:A>
No salary because he was an honorary worker <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#64:1:A>
And hence boys and girls <,,> I am a <,> a very senior persons so  
you are all boys and girls for me <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#65:1:A>
I was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard  
now fourth standard in my time <,> <mention> Abu Ben Adham </mention> <,>  
Adam means <indig> Aadam </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#66:1:A>
Really it is <indig> Aadam </indig> <,> but this Lee Hunts did not  
know <indig> Aadam </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#67:1:A>
So whether it is <indig> Aadam </indig> or Adam or Adham <,> same  
thing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#68:1:A>
<quote> Abu ben Adhem </quote> A D H E M <,> <quote> May his tribe  
increase </quote> <,> this is a famous phrase in English <,> May his tribe  
increase <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#69:1:A>
Today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds <,,> on the  
family front <,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#70:1:A>
So <quote> Abu ben Adhem <,> may his tribe increase </quote> <,>  
and <w> I'm </w> quoting this poem please remember <,> the way I am keeping  
time keeping rhythm <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#71:1:A>
This is how our teacher used to teach us <,> <quote> Abu ben Adhem  
may his tribe increase <,> Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace <,,>  
deep dream of peace </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#72:1:A>
Some of you <,> uh gentlemen <,,> have dreams <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#73:1:A>
Some of the dreams are black and white 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#74:1:A>
Some <,> some professors get into technicolour dreams <,> but that  
is alright <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#75:1:A>
<quote> Awoke from <,> from from one night <.> amo </.> from a deep

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#86:1:A>

Vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun </indig> <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#89:1:A>
So <indig> yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai </indig> <,,>  
so that thou <,,> thou pronoun is to be used when you are addressing God <,>  
when you are addressing your parents or mother <,> and when you are  
addressing <,,> your beloved

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#120:1:A>
I have <,> recited this sonnet <,,> a poem with fourteen lines  
<,,> because this is the <,,> description of all benifactors of mankind <,,>  
whether <,,> they are <,> people like Sadguru Gadage Maharaj <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#121:1:A>
I was professor <,> at Sadguru Gadage Maharaj <,> Karad <,,> and  
beyond our college there is <-> a </-> another college started by Yashwantrao  
<w> Chavan's </w> institute <,> Science college <,> Yashawantrao Chavan  
science college now <,> Venutai <.> Cha </.> Arts college now <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#122:1:A>
And those colleges had <,> very majestic and imposing buildings 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#123:1:A>
As your principal has said <,> six buildings worth sixteen <indig>  
lakhs </indig> of <indig> rupees </indig> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#124:1:A>
So I can't <,> I have not not only <.> cou </.> not counted but I  
can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#125:1:A>
And our Gadage Maharaj college was only a <,> a monastery <indig>  
math </indig> <,> of Sadguru Gadage Maharaj a small building <,> unimposing  
building <,> and me and <,,> Mrs Patil working there <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#126:1:A>
And the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#127:1:A>
Because as the principal said <,> we run forty-four colleges and  
three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#128:1:A>
Not even your director of education department run such an  
enterprise <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#129:1:A>
So we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over  
stepping us <,> and going to that college <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#130:1:A>
They said sir your Gadage Maharaj college is only a <indig> math  
</indig> <,> Gadage <w> Maharaja's </w> <indig> math </indig> <,,> <&>  
laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#131:1:A>
And that is true <,,> this <,,> person Gadage Maharaj <,,> Gadage  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#132:1:A>
Those of you who come from rural areas know what a <indig> gadage  
</indig> is <,,> ? <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#133:1:A>
These days nobody has seen a <indig> gadage </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#134:1:A>
We have only seen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#135:1:A>
He had this royal insignia <,,> this earthenware pot was the royal  
insignia of this great saint <,> <indig> gadage </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#136:1:A>
Ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have <,,>  
been born <,> in a nursing home <,,> because to be born in a nursing home you  
have to give a previous notice to the doctor 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#137:1:A>
In our case no notice was ever given <,,> <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#138:1:A>
Why we were born is a mystery <,,> ? <&> laughter </&> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#139:1:A>
How we were born is a still greater mystery <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#140:1:A>
And where we were born is a matter of conjecturing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#141:1:A>
Because my father was a primary school teacher <,> and therefore  
he has <-> written out </-> <,> written down <,> <-> noted </-> the date of  
my birth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#142:1:A>
But some of you <,,> not know your dates of birth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#143:1:A>
Gentlemen if you read <,> a famous book in English <,>  
Autobiography of Booker T Washington <,> Booker T Washing T means Telliferd  
Booker Telliferd Washington <,> the negro educator <,> who died in nineteen  
hundred and sixty <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#144:1:A>
Karmveer Bhaurao has been influenced by him also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#145:1:A>
Booker T <w> Washington's </w> autobiograpy is named as <,>  
<mention> Up from Slavery <,,> Up from Slavery </mention> <,,> translated  
into Marathi as <mention> Atmaudhar </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#146:1:A>
And the very first sentence of that autobiography is <,> I was  
born somewhere <,> and some when <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#147:1:A>
Where I was born nobody knows <,> and when I was born nobody knows  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#148:1:A>
So <,,> this <,,> we were born in a dingy room <,,> on a makeshift  
cot <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#149:1:A>
Not a modern cot <,> but a makeshift cot <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#150:1:A>
And when our mother <,> have delivered us or must have delivered  
us <,,> we were heated by <,,> the coals put in an earthern ware pot <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#151:1:A>
So our association <,> with <,,> this earthenware pot <indig>  
gadaga </indig> is from our birth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-035#152:1:A>
And when we are about to breathe our last <,> may it be a far off  
event you see when we are about to breathe our last <,,> somebody has to  
carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession <,,> </I>
