<ICE-IND:S2B-037#1:1:A>
Festivals are <,> rightly said to be the living history of a  
nation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#2:1:A>
They are inextricably linked <,> with the culture <,> religion <,>  
philosophy and literature <,> of a people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#3:1:A>
And are thus connected with the innocent of man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#4:1:A>
India is a unique country in the sense <,,> that it has such a large  
number of festivals <,,> which have become living traditions of a unique  
nature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#5:1:A>
They carry rhythm <,> the entire story of the growth of our culture  
<,,> mostly in a condensed form <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#6:1:A>
So much so <,> that it has become almost impossible <,> to single  
out an incident or factor <,,> associated with a particular Indian festival  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#7:1:A>
<w> It's </w> equally futile now to say <,,> that a particular caste  
or section of society <,> is primarily responsible <,> for a particular  
festival <,> in the modern context <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#8:1:A>
<indig> Raksha Bandhan </indig> is <,> one of such unique festivals  
<,> of our country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#9:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a cultural festival of the Aryan race <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#10:1:A>
It is celebrated <,,> on the full moon day <,> of <indig> Shravan  
</indig> <,,> and that is why it is also called <,> <indig> Shravani </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#11:1:A>
A very old name of this festival <,> is <indig> Rishi tarpan  
</indig> also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#12:1:A>
On this particular day <,> Brahmins used to put on new sacred  
threads <,> or a <O> one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#13:1:A>
The rituals of <indig> yadnya </indig> were performed <,,> and the  
heads of <indig> ashramas </indig> <,> tied sacred yellow thread <,> around  
the wrists of the people <,> while chanting vedic hymns <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#14:1:A>
Subsequently <,,> this thread itself came to be known <,> as  
<indig> Raksha Bandhan </indig> <,> or <indig> Rakhi </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#15:1:A>
As said earlier <,> quite a few stories are associated with this  
festival <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#16:1:A>
One of them reminds us <,,> of the great <indig> daitya </indig>  
king Bali <,,> living long long before Ram <,,> in the <indig> treta yug  
</indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#17:1:A>
Bali took a vow <,> of defeating Indra <,> and ruling over the  
entire universe <,> including <indig> swarg lok </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#18:1:A>
He went to his <indig> guru </indig> Shukracharya <,,> bid to him  
his compliments <,> and sought his blessings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#19:1:A>
<indig> Daitya guru </indig> Shukra gave his blessings to Bali <,,>  
with a holy <indig> tilak </indig> on his forehead <,,> and a sacred thread  
<,> or <indig> raksha sutra </indig> around his wrist <,,> this made Bali  
strong <,> and invincible on the battle field <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#20:1:A>
He wiped out his enemies <,,> and became the supreme power in the  
universe <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#21:1:A>
During the later feudal ages <,> the kings and warriors used to  
obtain this sacred <indig> raksha sutra </indig> <,> from their <indig> gurus  
<,> purohits </indig> <,> or other Brahmins <,> before going out to the  
battle fields <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#22:1:A>
Gradually <,> it became an annual ritual <,,> and then a public  
festival <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#23:1:A>
Even today <,> a <indig> purohit </indig> can be heard chanting  
<,,> <indig> yen badhwa Bali raja danvendra mahabalaha <,> ten twam  
manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#24:1:A>
Which means <,,> I tie you with the sacred thread <,> with which  
<indig> daitya raj </indig> Bali was tied by his <indig> guru </indig> <,,>  
your protection may be sure <,> and firm <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#25:1:A>
Well <,,> there goes another story <,,> that when the demons  
attacked <w> Indira's </w> kingdom <,,> he prepared to fight them out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#26:1:A>
Before he set out <,> his queen Shachi <,> put the sacred <indig>  
tilak </indig> on his forehead <,> and the sacred thread <,> the <indig>  
raksha sutra </indig> <,> or <indig> rakhi </indig> on his right wrist <,,>  
which made Indra unconquerable on the battle field <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#27:1:A>
Even during the Rajput period <,,> history tells us <,,> wives used  
to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner <,,> after  
tying the <indig> raksha sutra </indig> <,> to their wrists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#28:1:A>
Subsequently <,,> we do not know exactly when and how <,> sisters  
started tying this sacred <indig> raksha bandhan </indig> around their  
brothers wrists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#29:1:A>
And the whole thing got converted <,> into the modern festival of  
<indig> raksha bandhan </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#30:1:A>
Despite these changes <,> in the form of the ritual <,,> the  
importance of the sacred thread has stayed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#31:1:A>
This thread <,> has always been reminding man <,,> whether a  
<indig> gurus </indig> deciple <,> or sisters brother <,> or wives gallant  
husband <,> or any other common man <,> of his obligations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#32:1:A>
Even people from outside Indian context <,,> have been influenced  
by the holy feelings <,> inspired by this sacred thread <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#33:1:A>
When Alexander came to India <,> he perchanced saw an Indian woman  
<,> offering a sacred thread to a river on this particular day <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#34:1:A>
Surprised when he asked her what she had done <,> and when she told  
him <,> the significance of this ritual <,> he requested the woman to tie the  
<indig> sutra </indig> to his wrist also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#35:1:A>
And she gladly did so <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#36:1:A>
Similarly the great mughal emperor Humayun <,> stood against the  
muslim ruler of Gujarat <,> in order to protect Karmavati <,> the queen of  
Chittor <,,> who sent the <indig> raksha sutra </indig> or <indig> rakhi  
</indig> to him <,> and requested him <,> to protect his sister <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#37:1:A>
In fact <,,> this festival of <indig> raksha bandhan </indig> has  
been a unique Indian tradition <,,> cutting across all the ages <,,> and all  
the sections of the Indian society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#38:1:A>
Any man feels proud of the holy thread <,> his sister puts on his  
wrist <,,> and does everything within his power to protect her honour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#39:1:A>
In the present context <,,> the thread puts the burden of the  
sisters protection <,> on the brother <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#40:1:A>
In this way <,,> <indig> raksha bandhan </indig> has acquired a new  
social meaning <,,> and a new social purpose <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#41:1:A>
But the tradition goes on <,> and on <,,> restoring a gleam of  
fresh love <,> and assurance <,> in the eyes of brothers and sisters <,> on  
this unique day <,,> </I> 
 
 
<I> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-037#42:2:A>
Some time ago <,> I saw in some <w> friend's </w> house <,> I  
don't remember now in whose <,,> I am the master of this house <,,> and I  
have my <w> wife's </w> permission to say so <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#43:2:A>
To my mind the statement <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> acquired  
the value of a powerful platitude <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#44:2:A>
All the honourable members of the fraternity <,> of the henpecked  
<,,> would probably assert <,> that a married man can do anything he likes  
<,,> if his wife doesn't mind it <,> because freedom is compulsory for him  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#45:2:A>
He must enjoy this freedom <,> when his mistress is favourably  
inclined after all the labours of love and household <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#46:2:A>
After all as Arnold Banard declared long ago <,,> being a husband  
is a whole time job <,,> and as per the globally accepted labour laws <,,>  
every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#47:2:A>
Of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#48:2:A>
What he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his  
wife <,> who is very gifted <,,> that is <,,> young and beautiful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#49:2:A>
He has no cause to mourn <,> if she sometime discards his proposals  
or even dictates <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#50:2:A>
Isn't she his better-half <,,> obviously therefore she often gets  
better of him <,> and his arguments <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#51:2:A>
Thus <,> what she hits <,> becomes history <,,> and whatever she  
misses <,,> remains mystery <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#52:2:A>
She frankly admits <,> that there are two sides to every question  
<,> her own <,> and the wrong side <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#53:2:A>
Precisely for this reason <,> very often he proposes <,> and she  
disposes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#54:2:A>
It is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers  
<,> poets <,,> administrators and rulers <,> have seen the tyranny of their  
wives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#55:2:A>
Plato and Aristotle ruled the world in their own way <,,> but could  
seldom have their own way <,> with their wives <,> who believed <,> that the  
road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#56:2:A>
Isn't their belief upheld by history <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#57:2:A>
Who made Kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the  
world <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#58:2:A>
Who pushed Tulsi to the world of immortality <,> and undying fame  
<,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#59:2:A>
Modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for  
experiencing <,> real pathos in life <,,> and then enriching <,> their  
literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#60:2:A>
<w> Fanny's </w> no put into <w> Keats' </w> throat a number of  
sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#61:2:A>
I pity Dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was <,> when he  
suggested <,> that he would be greatly relieved when the wife was gone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#62:2:A>
He suggested his epitaph for her grave <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#63:2:A>
<quote> Here lies my wife <,,> here let her lie <,,> now she is at  
rest <,,> and so am I </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#64:2:A>
Even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere  
<,,> but <w> that's </w> just unfair <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#65:2:A>
Generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general  
observation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#66:2:A>
One day when a grocer complained about Mrs <w> Lincoln's </w> burst  
of temper <,> Mr Abraham Lincoln the great American President <,> laid a  
comforting hand on the <w> grocer's </w> shoulder and murmured <,,> <quote>  
Can you not stand for fifteen minutes <,> what I have stood for fifteen years  
</quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#67:2:A>
Well <,,> President Lincoln knew <,> </quote> The time heals all  
wounds </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#68:2:A>
Although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep  
his cool <,> <quote> The time also wounds all heals </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#69:2:A>
This would explain Charles Haddons Pergent humble supplication <,>  
god <,> save us all from wives <,> who are <mention> angels </mention> in the  
street <,> <mention> saints </mention> in the church <,> and <mention> devils  
</mention> at home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#70:2:A>
We must give them their due <,> musn't we <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#71:2:A>
With sincere apologies to Oscar Wilde it can be said <,> that the  
only way to get rid of a <w> wife's </w> callous rejection <,> is to yield to  
it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#72:2:A>
All you need in this life <,> in order to escape your <w> wife's  
</w> summary rejection of your proposals <,> is ignorance and confidence <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#73:2:A>
You must drive out from your life all superstitions <,> like  
science and medicines <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#74:2:A>
As George Bernard Shaw would put it <,> <quote> Because a woman  
cannot put up with these unhealthy things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#75:2:A>
A woman is like an empire <,> in a way <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#76:2:A>
She makes quick decisions <,> never reverses them <,> and doesn't  
think you are safe when you are out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#77:2:A>
In these things as in most others <,> a <w> woman's </w> wit is  
often better than a <w> man's </w> arm <,> and fate with her <,> is often at  
his <w> wit's </w> end </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#78:2:A>
It must not be however concluded that I am a misogynist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#79:2:A>
Far from it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#80:2:A>
Although some left balanced male thinkers <,,> describe a balanced  
woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#81:2:A>
I do not subcribe to this view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#82:2:A>
<w> It's </w> true that in some parts of the world <,> even today  
women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do <,,> but women are not  
handicapped on account of this legal flaw <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#83:2:A>
Thanks to the generosity of nature <,> they are blessed with so  
much of irresistible natural power <,> that no discriminatory laws can harm  
them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#84:2:A>
However <,> there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among  
some misguided husbands <,> who recently formed an association in New Delhi  
<,> to press for their deliverance from the tyrany of their wives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#85:2:A>
I don't understand this <,> because wives in India hopefully <,>  
have not yet taken to husband battering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#86:2:A>
They do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would  
be any woman who has an ideal husband <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#87:2:A>
This however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind <,> that whoever  
it was <,> who first called women <mention> the fair sex </mention> didn't  
know much about justice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#88:2:A>
I hope my wife isn't listening to me now <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#89:2:A>
Sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can  
have <,,> and hang <,> the wisest man in the world <,,> and so any wife can  
drive even the most sensible husband to desperation <,> by just using a  
disasterous word <,,> <mention> no </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#90:2:A>
I think <,> it will do everybody good to analyse the situations <,>  
in which she disposes as soon as he proposes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#91:2:A>
The <w> wife's </w> genius is the first factor that makes her avert  
to her <w> husband's </w> initiative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#92:2:A>
Do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#93:2:A>
Save your sympathy for the man who marries her <,,> because not  
before long <,> all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread  
in the world <,,> like wild fire <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#94:2:A>
In such cases <,> the brilliant wife may not only dispose <,> but  
go to the extent of disposing him off <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#95:2:A>
Nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly  
beautiful <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#96:2:A>
Such a beautiful wife <,> may not only come forward to edit her <w>  
poet husband's </w> poem <,,> but may even venture to edit him personally  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#97:2:A>
An ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent <,,> and  
other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman  
with relation <,> of whom she would always boast <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#98:2:A>
There may be extremely successful people in society because of  
their wealth power or excellences in some art <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#99:2:A>
The wife would tend to pity her husband <,> and pity herself <,>  
secretly <,,> but whenever an opportunity is <,> is there <,> she would  
spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly <,> for being an  
inferior soul <,> or lesser mortal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#100:2:A>
Finally <,> the <w> husband's </w> indiscreet and total submission  
to his better half <,,> usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter  
half <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#101:2:A>
The husband must realise <,> that his wife is a shadow <,> who  
will turn <,> and run ahead of him <,> never to be caught <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#102:2:A>
If he runs after her <,> but who will follow him tirelessly <,> if  
he even pretend to move away from her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#103:2:A>
Anyway <,,> do not grieve friends <,> if she still disposes <,> as  
you are on the surest way to greatness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-037#104:2:A>
Behind every man <,> with pull is a woman with a push <,,> but  
quite naturally <,> he proposes <,> and she disposes <,,> </I>
