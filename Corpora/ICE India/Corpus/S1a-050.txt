<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#1:1:A>
So <,,> what do you think about the disaster happened <,>
<indig> Dakshin </indig> Maharashtra about earthquake <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#2:1:B>
Actually Umesh <,,> as we have seen <,> there are a lot of
people <,> died <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#3:1:A>
Ahn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#4:1:B>
So <,,> uh according to scientists they are expecting one more
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#5:1:B>
But this is very very <,> serious disaster happened <,,> last month
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#6:1:A>
Uhm <,> but do you think that <,,> what has happened is for
good or bad <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#7:1:B>
No no it is extremely bad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#8:1:B>
In the last <,> around ten fifteen years this is the worst <,,> uh
disaster happened <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#9:1:A>
In India or on earth <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#10:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#11:1:A>
In India or in the world <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#12:1:B>
Uh <,> I can't tell in the world because I don't know more
about <,> other <,> sides happened <,> but in India this is the very very
serious <,,> hit to <,,> the people and also to the country <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#13:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#14:1:B>
As <,,> as this is a very <,,> serious happened <,,> Mr P V
Narasimha Rao should have <}> <-> take </-> <+> taken </+> </}> a very <,>
serious step on this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#15:1:A>
Oh yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#16:1:B>
And that affected a lot of people <,,> and also many houses
every thing has been <,,> crushed <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#17:1:A>
Do you think <,,> anything that will be going to happen in <,>
India <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#18:1:B>
Yeah Umesh <,,> just for the day

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#19:1:A>
Have changed in India <,> <{> <[> earthquake </[> my friend

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#20:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#21:1:B>
Yes Umesh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#22:1:B>
Actually what happened is <,> scientists have predicted that <,>
there will be a <,,> serious <,,> earthquake in one <,> uh again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#23:1:B>
In uh most probably in December <,> as they have predicted <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#24:1:B>
Because uh <,> before that time they have to take <,> more
precautions <,,> as there is a lot of <,,> life lost <,> in the <,,>
earthquake till now <,> a serious <,> step has to be taken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#25:1:B>
So we have to think about it <,,> a lot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#26:1:A>
What do you <,> think about those people <,,> whose lives have
gone <,,> whose lives have gone in earthquake <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#27:1:B>
Yeah <,,> there are uhm <,> there are lot of <,,> relief funds
coming from outside the country and <,> people are also donating <,,> on this
<&> break in recording </&>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#28:1:B>
There are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries <,>
like uh <,,> donations of <,> amount and aid <,> and also the <,> food <O>
one word </O> like uh food <,,> uh from other countries and also <,,> from
<,> the people are also donating <,,> <&> break in recording </&>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#29:1:B>
But don't you think that it will be better that if uh <,,> the
people <,,> take up <,,> general opinion of <,,> say uhm helping us <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#30:1:A>
Yeah we like to have it so <,> taking to uh <,,> what is
called <,,> uh box or something <,> and uh going on <,> just asking for
relief <,> this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think
it is better <,,> Mr Mahesh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#31:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#32:1:B>
Uhm <,> yeah I think <,,> people are donating and also <,,> the <,>
a lot of participants are coming <,,> to take part in the relief <,> fund
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#33:1:B>
So <,,> as far as my thinking <,,> people are donating as much as
possible for the relief fund as <,,> they think that <,,> their own pople are
dying from <,,> whole everything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#34:1:B>
So <,,> we also should have to take part in that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#35:1:B>
As far as my

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#36:1:A>
But Mr Mahesh <,> see what I think is <,> uh that people being
suffered <,,> by this <,> uh being wounded <,,> in all this cases <,> <w>
it'll </w> be better if those people uh <,,> <}> <-> would </-> <=> would
</=> </}> have lost their lives <,> because see all the things what has
happened <,,> it all most more <,> uh <w> it's </w> been happened <,> slum
areas you can say always <,> you get

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#37:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#38:1:A>
So <,> and <,,> you can have <,> and one more thing is <,> uh
not only in India but also as <,> uh and most of the countries are concerned
<,> all this uh <,,> what is called uh <,> the unwanted scenes happen only in
slums <,> like uh you know this uh <,> raped and uh <,> they all this multi-
millionaires trying to become <,> more and more <,> millionaire <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> by destroying all the slums

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#39:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#40:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#41:1:A>
So what I think is <,> <w> it'll </w> be better if all those
people <,> would have lost their lives in <,> uh the earthquake

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#42:1:B>
Yeah <,,> so what do you think <,> which is more beneficial
<,,> to participate in the earthquake <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#43:1:A>
Because as far as participation is concerned uh <,> it would
be better <,> first uh those people who are <,,> uh half the way

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#44:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#45:1:A>
In their life that is uh <,,> half the thing they are <,>
living and the other half side they are <,> dying in that case <w> it'll </w>
be better <,,> people <.> gener </.> donate generously

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#46:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#47:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what I think <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#48:1:A>
And <-> more </-> one more thing is <,,> if people would have lost
their lives the population also would have gone down

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#49:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#50:1:A>
So <,> from that point of view <,> the other people also <,>
would have been uh benefitted <,,> because the earthquake doesn't bring <,,>
the problem of uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#51:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#52:1:A>
Eatables

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#53:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#54:1:A>
Then uh any other <,> miscellening uh purpose

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#55:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#56:1:A>
That wouldn't be much of problems <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#57:1:B>
And what do you think of the <w> PM's </w> <,> participation
in this <,> relief fund uh relief <,,> Umesh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#58:1:A>
As far as <w> PM's </w> is concerned the prime minister uhm
<,,> <w> he's </w> working quite hard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#59:1:A>
Of course <,,> uh I think even he is generating I mean he is
donating generously <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#60:1:A>
But to some extent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#61:1:A>
We can't say that he isn't uh <,> uh helping them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#62:1:A>
<w> It's </w> his duty to <,> those because <,> he is the prime
minister of the country no <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#63:1:B>
So now what do you think about the <,,> earthquake in
Maharashtra <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#64:1:B>
There a around thirty thousand <,> people have died and what do you
<,> feel which is <,,> better

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#65:1:A>
No as I told you before that <,> uh <w> it'll </w> <.> be </.>
<,> the thing was better if all the people <,> would have lost their lives in
that <,> as I told you before

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#66:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#67:1:A>
Because <,> one more thing is <,> now this medical expenses
<,> and going for that thing as far as <,> living uh even <,> the medical
expenses have been given free the all items

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#68:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#69:1:A>
But as far as uh other thing is concerned

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#70:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#71:1:A>
They <,> being lost their property and other thing <,> <{> <[>
uhm <,> they naturally feel <,> uh bad about <,> they feel that <,> the life
is miserable

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#72:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#73:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#74:1:A>
<w> It's </w> better <,> if they would have lost their lives
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#75:1:B>
Now what do you think about <,> the people <,> maximum many of
the people have died in Maharashtra

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#76:1:A>
Oh yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#77:1:B>
So what do think about them <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#78:1:A>
About them <,,> <.> sa </.> sad <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#79:1:B>
What would be better if <,> what would be the better steps to
be taken <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#80:1:A>
I think it was good what have what happened was good <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#81:1:B>
And what about <,> what do you think about the <,,> uh
earthquake happened <,> in Gulbarga that is in Karnataka <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#82:1:A>
Yeah in Karnataka that same opinion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#83:1:B>
No many people they <,> uh very few died and also

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#84:1:A>
No the same thing <,> that has been applicable to Maharashtra
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#85:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#86:1:B>
So okay <,> uh now <,> <w> we'll </w> shift on to some other this
one <,,> uh <&> recording broken </&>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#87:1:B>
Okay Umesh <,> what do you think about the <indig> Dussera </indig>
festival that is <,,> uh from next week they <,> uh the college <,> has
declared holiday <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#88:1:B>
So what do you think about it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#89:1:A>
Enjoyable <,,> <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#90:1:B>
Okay Umesh uh <,> actually what I am thinking is I am thinking
to <,> of going to Mysore <,,> and uh <,> spending there a week <,> seeing
the <indig> Dussera </indig> festival that is <,,> uh in front of Mysore
Palace <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#91:1:B>
There will be a <,> big crowd and also <,> the Mysore <indig>
Maharaja </indig> <,> the <,> uh <indig> Maharaja </indig> will be <,> seated
on an elephant <,> and <,> uh all uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#92:1:A>
I <O> a few words </O> <,> some Maharaja at present <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#93:1:B>
No actually his grandsons are there

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#94:1:B>
So <,> they are going to <,,> uh get him seated uh on an elephant
in the place of their fore-fathers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#95:1:B>
So there will be all ministers <,> and also the Prime Minister will
be attending the <,,> uh function <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#96:1:B>
So I think there is a grand festival and <,> people from all over
the country will be <,,> coming <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#97:1:B>
Okay Umesh what do you think about the <.> compt </.> competitive
exams conducted by <,> the All India level <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#98:1:A>
<w> It's </w> good for students <,,> to come up in life

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#99:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#100:1:A>
So <,> they got plenty of <.> comp </.> competitive exams

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#101:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#102:1:A>
So it helps uh <,> students come up in life

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#103:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#104:1:A>
In <,> just not in monopolying <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> they have
got plenty of <,> other way

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#105:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#106:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#107:1:A>
So it really helps <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#108:1:A>
<w> It's </w> something like an entrance <,> something you say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#109:1:B>
Yeah like <,> uh many <,> most of the <,> intelligent persons
will be filterd <,> and will be <,> placed in a top most position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#110:1:B>
And uh <,,> so it helps a lot of students who <,> want to be in a
good position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#111:1:B>
And so what do you think about their <,> this one future or <,> uh
like will it be good or <,,> uh will there be any <,,> politics or what do
you think about it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#112:1:A>
No as far as <,> their will <,> power and their mind is
concerned <,> if they are well strong enough <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#113:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#114:1:A>
<w> They'll </w> be well placed <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#115:1:B>
No <,> what I am <{> <[> thinking if there is some </[>
political <,> background like uh <,,> from some minister <,> any influence
comes and <,,> uh will they change their mind or will <,,> the correct person
will be placed on position

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#116:1:A>
<[> <w> They'll </w> have good or uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#117:1:A>
Hey <w> that's </w> what <w> I'm </w> telling no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#118:1:A>
As far as the will power and the mind is strong <,> <{> <[> uhm
<,> they need not have to <,,> uh keep uh <,,> say <,,> they need not have to
keep themselves down <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#119:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#120:1:B>
Yeah okay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#121:1:B>
Now what do you think about the State Competitive Exams <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#122:1:A>
State competitive exams <,,> right <,,> people are uh <,>
taking much of interest in Union State competitive exams

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#123:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#124:1:B>
Know what I think is <,> in the national level <,> many of them
who have done well will not be qualified

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#125:1:A>
Fine <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#126:1:B>
Sometimes in the state level they may be qualified <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#127:1:B>
Their intelligence may be understood <,> or their <,> intelligence
can be <,,> seen by the examiners or some <,,> higher persons who are going
to conduct the exams <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#128:1:B>
So I think uh <,> this this is more <,,> uh <w> it's </w> good
competitive exams all India and state level it is quite good <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#129:1:B>
It helps people in many ways and also <,,> influences many of the
<,> people to come up <,,> and also be placed in a good position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#130:1:B>
Well <,> what do you think about the <,> university exams
conducted <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#131:1:A>
So university exams are conducted uh <,,> see at present
India is considerable you know plenty of universities <,> union level

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#132:1:B>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#133:1:A>
And some of the <,> some of the universities

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#134:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#135:1:A>
Their <,> great <,,> wisdom

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#136:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#137:1:A>
So what I think is doing in that particular university

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#138:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#139:1:A>
The persons career <,> to some extent might be spoilt

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#140:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#141:1:A>
Because <,,> moreover <,> now-a-days <,> when we go away <,>
for job opportunities

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#142:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#143:1:A>
What they ask is <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#144:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#145:1:A>
Preferably from a good <,> recognised university

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#146:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#147:1:A>
And if the university has got a black spot

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#148:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#149:1:A>
Naturally all the persons who has <,> studied in that <,>
particular university

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#150:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#151:1:A>
Also <,,> the same thing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#152:1:B>
Will be a waste

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#153:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#154:1:B>
To the student who has studied over there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#155:1:A>
Exactly <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#156:1:B>
And what do you think about the <,,> college itself <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#157:1:B>
If the college is not good how can a university be <,,> uh means
<,> uh be pointed out <,>

The college is not good in the sense what do you mean <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#159:1:B>
Like uh <,,> lecturers are not good or <,> students may not
be good <,,> or sometimes <,> the placement may not be good <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#160:1:A>
As far as lecturers are concerned

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#161:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#162:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#165:1:A>
As far as students are concerned <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#166:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#167:1:A>
The main thing all depends on students

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#168:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#169:1:A>

</w> <,> with studies

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#174:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#175:1:A>
With lecturers <,> they can have good relation <{> <[> also
</[> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#176:1:A>
But suppose if the students <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> don't have <,> to
build up their <,> good friendship

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-050#177:1:B>

Yeah <,> and uh <,,> I think <,> the flood relief <,> might
take a good turn <,> and in the earthquake <,,> may take a good turn and <,>
it may <,> be of some help to the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-050#190:1:B>

discussion by <,,> this topic itself
