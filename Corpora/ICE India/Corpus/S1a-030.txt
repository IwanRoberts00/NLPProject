How do you like the place <,> Prabha <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#2:1:B>

constitution with weather <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#3:1:B>
Yes I too find it uh little bit chill <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#4:1:A>
What about you Uma <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#5:1:C>
No I think when I came here initially I wasn't well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#6:1:C>
Now I think I got accustomed to this climate and other thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#7:1:C>
How about you <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#8:1:A>
No initially it didn't affect me but I think <,> uh now my
resistance <,,> is much less <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and <,> I have got <,> sore
throat <,> cold

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#9:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#10:1:C>
Uhm <,> I think it must be also because that you are away from
your son

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#11:1:A>
Yeah ah <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#12:1:C>
By the way how old is your son <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#14:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#15:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#26:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#28:1:C>
And my husband also has written to me saying that he miss me a lot

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#29:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#37:1:B>
Fifth and Sixth

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#38:1:B>
Girls in <,> <{> <[> yes <,> the problem of platting the hair
washing the hair

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#39:1:B>
I don't know what they are doing at home

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#40:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#41:1:B>
My husband must be just keeping the cooker and they must be
eating just <indig> daal </indig> and rice

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#42:1:C>
When you go

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#43:1:A>
Your husband is a good cook I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#44:1:B>
No he not I don't say he is a good cook but he will manage
somehow I think

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#45:1:A>
Yeah yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#46:1:C>
Know when we go back no I think <w> we'll </w> get a rosy
welcome home <{> <[> welcome there </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#47:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{> <O> laughter </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#48:1:C>
Everybody would have missed us a lot no <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#49:1:A>
Perhaps they will understand our value better then <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#50:1:A>
All the work which we did then

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#51:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#52:1:A>
Sometime this parting is necessary no <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>
temporary parting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#53:1:A>
Especially <O> one or two words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#54:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#55:1:C>
Yeah <w> we'll </w> also realise their importance and <w>
they'll </w> also <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#56:1:B>
Ah yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#57:1:A>
Especially my <w> son's </w> case no <,> he is very much
attached <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#58:1:A>
I feel <,> uh that <,> this separation will help him to <,,> uh get
<,> uh become a little bit independent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#59:1:A>
But the only thing <w> I'm </w> bothered is regarding his studies
no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#60:1:A>
Because I help him a lot with his studies <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#61:1:A>
Now <{> <[> of course </[> <w> he's </w> got to get the help of his
father or grand parents or someone else <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#62:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#63:1:B>
<indig> Ayyo </indig> my daughters were saying you know <,>
<{> <[> yeah <,> before I left they were saying <,> <quote> how will we study
</quote>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#64:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#65:1:B>
Because <,> <w> I'm </w> the one who coaches them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#66:1:B>
My husband comes at very late from work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#67:1:B>
And he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#68:1:B>
So all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as
if no <,> like <w> it's </w> like <,,> even though I would they would have
felt <,> uh mummy is not letting us play and all so long <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#69:1:B>
Now that uh strictness is removed from them <,> they I think <w>
they'll </w> feel a bit insecure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#70:1:B>
So they were asking me

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#71:1:C>
My son too needs me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#72:1:C>
Otherwise he won't touch the book <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#73:1:C>
I don't know what he <,> he is doing in my absence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#74:1:C>
May be <w> he's </w> cutting his tution classes <,> and <,,> uh
just whiling away the time <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#75:1:A>
But he is with your parents no

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#76:1:C>
Yes <O> a few words </O> pamper <,> pamper him a lot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#77:1:A>
<w> It's </w> okay <,> just for a month <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#78:1:A>
For a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his
normal routine <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#79:1:C>
How about your hobbies and all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#80:1:C>
What do you do during your

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#81:1:A>
I I <,> I play with my son <,> <{> <[> yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#82:1:A>
He doesn't like chess because he has to use his <,> <{> <[> brain
</[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#83:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#84:1:C>
<[> Brain </[> </{> well

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#85:1:A>
He like <,> shuttle cock better than that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#86:1:A>
<{> <[> So I play </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#87:1:C>
<[> No even for </[> </{> shuttle cock you have to use your
brain

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#88:1:C>
You have to <{> <[> <O> one or two words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#89:1:A>
<[> No <O> one or two words </O> </[> </{> maybe that <{> <[>
kind of </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#90:1:C>
<[> Kind of </[> </{> but it would be better than an indoor
game no <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#91:1:A>
No <w> it's </w> an indoor game only <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#92:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#93:1:B>
Oh shuttle cock <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#94:1:A>
But I play it as an outdoor game <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#95:1:A>
Of course when <w> it's </w> very windy we can't do that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#96:1:A>
And he expects me to run about <,> just like <,,> uh <,> <{1> <[1>
uhm <,> young girl <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> which <w> I'm </w> not able to do
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#97:1:A>
So very often he wins <,> and I lose <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#98:1:C>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#99:1:C>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#100:1:C>
Only you lost to your little son <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#101:1:A>
What about you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#102:1:A>
What do you do during your spare time

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#103:1:B>
<{1> <[1> My hobby is tailoring </[1> and <{2> <[2> uh some

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#107:1:B>
Sing <,> I like to sing but where is the time except in the
bathroom or in the kitchen <O> laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#108:1:A>
But you learn music <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#109:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#246:1:B>
We never go <,> <{> <[> why <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#247:1:B>
Only my poor <,> parents will only come

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#248:1:C>
<[> Why </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#249:1:C>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#250:1:B>
I never stir out of the house <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#251:1:B>
In fact I don't even know who my neighbours are <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#252:1:B>
Of course I know them <,> I don't mean it literally

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#253:1:C>
No I know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#254:1:B>
Where is the time to talk <,> day today events with them

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#255:1:C>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#256:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> a waste of time no

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#257:1:B>
Once we enter the house if we talk to the neighbours uh

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#258:1:C>
I don't know my <w> husband's </w> friend he manages to spent
atleast <O> one or two words </O> with the neighbours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#259:1:C>
I don't know what they must be thinking of me <,> but of course I
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#260:1:B>
Even I I live in a flat

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#261:1:C>
Not <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#262:1:B>
So naturally when there are forty-eight <,> <{1> <[1> flats
there <,> yeah flats there and so <,> inspite of that <,> just I won't be
able to talk for even five minutes with my neighbour <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#263:1:B>
Means hardly five minutes I spend with them no

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#264:1:B>
Just while going to school <,> <w> I'll </w> just say hello and
then in the evening by this all <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#265:1:B>
Nothing at all no time to go and talk

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#266:1:C>
<[1> Flats there </[1> </{1>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#269:1:C>
And they are so helpful <,> because we are away most of the
day no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#270:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#274:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#275:1:A>
<[> I never </[> </{> manage to get all this done <,> when
<w> I'm </w> at home <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#276:1:C>
No you have no other go <,> <w> you've </w> to do it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#277:1:A>
Because <w> it's </w> an independent house and <,> uh no my
neighbours are not very close

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#278:1:C>
Uhm <,> so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#279:1:A>
But my son makes up for it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#280:1:A>
There is a little boy there <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> so my son goes and
plays with that boy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#281:1:A>
And they very thick friends

<ICE-IND:S1A-030#282:1:A>
Only we elders we don't have much time to <,> converse and talk
and all

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-030#283:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{> </I>
