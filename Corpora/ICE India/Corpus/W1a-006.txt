<h> <bold> DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#2:1>
Prevention of pregnancy induced hypertension is an important
clinical objective which requires both an ability to predict the high risk
patients and an effective prophylactic therapy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#3:1>
Mean Arterial Pressure values of more than 90 mm Hg. in the late
second trimester are related to the subsequent development of PIH and
identify the high risk subjects. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#4:1>
Previous clinical trials have suggested that aspirin in the dose
of 50 to 150 mg per day during the second and third trimester reduces the
risk of pregnancy induced hypertension and improves maternal and neonatal
outcome. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#5:1>
In this study the effect of low dose aspirin on patients with
MAP-2 more than 90 mm Hg. was studied, along with an equal number of control
cases ( MAP-2 more than 90 mm Hg. but aspirin not started ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#6:1>
Both these groups were comparable with respect to age - incidence
and parity of the patients.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#7:1>
There was an impressive reduction in development of pregnancy induced
hypertension in aspirin group.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#8:1>
The occurrence rate of PIH in aspirin group was 26 % whereas it was 54
% with control group. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 10 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#9:1>
Low dose aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of IUGR in
the neonates ( 20 % in contrast to 51 % in the control group ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#10:1>
Low dose aspirin also increased the birth weight of new born ( 89
% of babies with birth weight > 2kg. in study group against 69 % of babies
with birth weight > 2kg. in control group ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#11:1>
In our small study , we didn't come across a single case of
haemorrhagic disease of newborn because aspirin was stopped two weeks before
the expected date of delivery. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#12:1>
We recommended that mean Arterial Pressure of each pregnant
patient should be calculated in the second trimester.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#13:1>
This can be easily determined by using blood pressure normogram
mentioned previously. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#14:1>
If MAP-2 is found more than 90 mm Hg, Tablet ASA 50 mg can be
started and it should be continued till completion of 38 wks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#15:1>
However development of PIH should be watched for. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#16:1>
This simple, low-cost treatment ( Tb ASA - - 50 mg costing 60
paise per tab. ) can minimise the maternal and fetal complications due to
pregnancy induced hypertension and therefore holds a lot of promise. </p> <O>

<ul> DISCUSSION </ul>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#18:2>
Hypertension disorders of pregnancy is a heterogeneous collection
of disease.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#19:2>
Pregnancy is a peculiar condition of stress and can affect blood
pressure.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#20:2>
PIH is a commonest cause of maternal and foetal mortality.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#21:2>
A simple clinical test that is mean arterial pressure in prediction
of PIH is used. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#22:2>
A study of 300 cases was done from June 91 to Oct. 92 at
obstetric and Gynecology department, Dr. V.M. Medical College, Solapur.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#23:2>
Study includes primigravidae and multigravidae.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#24:2>
All cases under observation from 5th - 6th months of gestation to
delivery.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#25:2>
All cases had antenatal care with approximately more than 3 visits.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#26:2>
In our study, out of 300 total cases, 152 i.e. 50.66 % were
primigravidae, 50 were second gravidae that is 16.66 % and 98 were
multigravidae that is 32.66 %.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#27:2>
All patients were normotensive at the time of registration.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#28:2>
61 % women were first registered at 20-24 weeks gestation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#29:2>
All were registered during second trimester of pregnancy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#30:2>
51.66 % women were below 25 yrs of age and 17 % women were 30 yrs
of age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#31:2>
Out of these 300 cases, 64.33 % were from urban area i.e. Solapur
proper and 35.66 % were from rural area with regular antenatal check up. </p>
<O> <&> page </&> 41 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#32:2>
Regular antenatal check up was done in the form of weight, Blood
pressure, presence of pedal oedema, degree of anaemia, urine albumin and
sugar, clinical physical examination.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#33:2>
Ultrasonography was done as a routine for all patients. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#34:2>
The average level of blood pressure was found to be 100 / 70mm
Hg. to 120 / 80 mmHg in 66 % of cases and more than 120 / 80 mmHg. But less
than 130 / 90 mm Hg in 34 % of cases. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#35:2>
Out of these total 300 cases, 21 patients had pregnancy induced
hypertension in previous pregnancy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#36:2>
19 cases i.e. 90.5 % were multigravidae and 9.5 % were primipara.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#37:2>
Increased incidence in multigravidae was probably due to advancing
age and inherent tendency of body after 28 yrs. of age to latent
hypertension. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#38:2>
Out of 152 primigravidae, 91 cases had MAP during second
trimester more than or equal to 90mm Hg.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#39:2>
64.73 % of <O> one word untyped </O> primigravidae developed PIH in
third trimester.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#40:2>
Hence with MAP-2 ò90mm Hg, the chance of development of PIH is 64.73%
which is significant.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#41:2>
6 primigravidae out of 6 with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105 mmHg
developed preeclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#42:2>
Hence MAP-2 ò 105mm Hg is indicative of PIH.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#43:2>
Only 7.2% of women with MAP-2 less than 90mm Hg developed PIH in
third trimester which is not significant.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#44:2>
Patients with MAP &gt; 90 mm Hg are considered as high risk cases.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#45:2>
Hence second trimester MAP is a predictor of future pre-eclampsia
in primigravida. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 42 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#46:2>
Out of 50 second graidae, 18 cases had MAP during second
trimester more than or equal to 90mm Hg. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#47:2>
22.22% of second gravidae developed pre-eclampsia in third
trimester.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#48:2>
This shows less incidence of pre-eclampsia in second gravida.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#49:2>
2 cases out of 2, with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105mm of Hg had
developed pre-eclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#50:2>
Hence MAP-2 ò 105mm Hg is indicative of pre-eclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#51:2>
None of the women with MAP-2 less than 90mm of Hg developed
pre-eclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#52:2>
Hence there is no role of mean arterial pressure in second gravida
with development of future pre-eclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#53:2>
This supports the Immunological theory of PIH, pre-eclampsia affects
first pregnancy and immunizes subsequent pregnancies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#54:2>
Out of 98 multigravidae, 64 had MAP during second trimester more
than or equal to 90 mm Hg.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#55:2>
32.81 % of cases developed pre-eclampsia in third trimester.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#56:2>
This shows more incidence of pre-eclampsia in multigravidae than
second gravida.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#57:2>
3 cases out of 3, with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105 mm of Hg had
developed pre-eclampsia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#58:2>
31 cases had MAP less than 90 mm Hg and 12.9% developed pre-eclampsia
in third trimester trimester showing the relation of advancing age
and development of PIH. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#59:2>
In our study, total incidence of development of pre-eclampsia in
primigravida was 64.59%. which is stastically highly significant
( p &lt; 0.01) gavida was 30%. 

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#60:2>
In second which is stastically insignificant ( P &gt; 0.05 ) . </p> </I>

The incidence of infant and neonatal mortality varies directly
with the status of development and availability of newer facilities of
obstetric and neonatal <del> care. </del> < in can in >

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#63:3>
In India neonatal mortality rate is still higher : 72.9 % in rural
areas and 38.8 % in urban areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#64:3>
The combined urban and rural rate is 66.7 % ( Park 1991).

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#65:3>
The main causes of mortality are infection and anoxia.

<ICE-IND:W1A-006#66:3>
In western countries the major cause of death during this period is
hyaline membrane disease due to vigorous oxygen therapy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-006#67:3>
One of the first detailed study among the western literature on

Prematurity, low birth weight and anoxia deserve special mention
as the first two are high risk factor in the new born period predisposing to
death [ Mehdi 61, <*> inserted </*> Maheshwari 19 is Valdes 1970, Banerjee,

Alveoli of such infants lack the normal surface active lining,
