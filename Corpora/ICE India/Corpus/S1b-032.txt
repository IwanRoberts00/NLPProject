<ICE-IND:S1B-032#1:1:A>
Good evening and welcome back to the Election Analysis
Programme

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#2:1:A>
This will be the last programme this evening

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#3:1:A>
And our last programme to <.> re </.> wind up will be tommorrow
night at the same time nine fifty

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#4:1:A>
Senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just
emerged actually from an informal meeting

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#5:1:A>
And <w> we'll </w> be going to the congress party head quarters to
try and find out what exactly happened in those <?> folk filled </?> rooms

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#6:1:A>
But first the <}> <-> head lights </-> <=> head lines </=> </}> at
ten <w> O'clock </w> tonight

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#7:1:A>
Congress-I and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and
thirty-five

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#8:1:A>
Still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#9:1:A>
The BJP plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#10:1:A>
In Andhra Pradesh the Congress-I is literally swamping <,> the June
vote <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#11:1:A>
In the May vote we saw the Telugu Desam <,> Desam doing well

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#12:1:A>
But in June <,> the Congress-I is literally sweeping <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#13:1:A>
H K L Bhagat is defeated <,,> and George Farnandis win <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#14:1:B>
<indig> Is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain
Congress-I wa uske sahyogi dal <,> do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#15:1:B>
Bhartiya Janata </indig> Party <indig> aur Shivsena ko <,> ek sau
bees seetein pane ki ummeed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#16:1:B>
Andhra Pradesh mei </indig> June <indig> ke matdan mei Congress
bahut aage <,> H K L Bhagat chunau hare <,> aur George Fernandis <,> chunau
jeete </indig> <,> Prannoy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#17:1:A>
Well Vinod <w> let's </w> go straight into the latest results
position

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#18:1:A>
This is final <w> MP's </w> in the next <indig> Lok Sabha </indig>
and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and
eleven seats <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#19:1:A>
The Congress-I one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#20:1:A>
The BJP coming second on its own with eighty-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#21:1:A>
The Janata Dal twenty-nine still <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#22:1:A>
CPM nineteen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#23:1:A>
The AIADMK eleven <,,> and others thirty-six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#24:1:A>
But Telugu Desam still part of the National Front with ten <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#25:1:A>
The <}> <-> <.> Ja </.> </-> <=> JMM </=> </}> five <,> CPI five
<,> all part of the National Front <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#26:1:A>
The BSP is fighting on its own with one seat now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#27:1:A>
RSP part of the National Front <,,> and uh totalling <,> thirty-six
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#28:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> look at the leading position

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#29:1:A>
These are the trends

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#30:1:A>
This includes results

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#31:1:A>
This is both leading and those results <w> we've </w> just seen
because we get the overall picture here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#32:1:A>
So we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of
five hundred and eleven seats <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#33:1:A>
And the Congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#34:1:A>
<w> It's </w> picked up uh three or four seats in U P at the
movement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#35:1:A>
But doesn't seems to be going much further <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#36:1:A>
BJP is coming second with hundred and seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#37:1:A>
The Janata Dal fifty-five on its own <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#38:1:A>
The CPM twenty-nine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#39:1:A>
The Telugu Desam thirteen

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#40:1:A>
These are all part of the <.> Nat </.> National Front

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#41:1:A>
Janata <,> uh National and Left Front combined <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#42:1:A>
Others sifty-two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#43:1:A>
CPI eleven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#44:1:A>
AIADMK eleven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#45:1:A>
The JMM six <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#46:1:A>
RSP three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#47:1:A>
Bahujan Samaj Party one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#48:1:A>
Making a total of others <,> sixty-two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#49:1:A>
Now this projects into the tenth <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> <,>
something like this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#50:1:A>
Congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two
thirty-five

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#51:1:A>
Take <,> uhm uh <,> plus or minus two three seats <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#52:1:A>
The Left Front looks as though <w> it's </w> heading towards fifty
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#53:1:A>
And the National Front eighty-five

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#54:1:A>
So together <,> they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and
thirty-five seats

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#55:1:A>
Likely to form this is prediction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#56:1:A>
<w> That's </w> ahead actually of the BJP and its allies which is
basically the Shivsena <,> which is now heading towards about a hundred and
twenty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#57:1:A>
And other minor parties are about twenty-one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#58:1:A>
So <w> that's </w> the kind of look <,> that we expect to see
inside the next tenth <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> <,> Vinod

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#59:1:B>
<w> We've </w> in our studios <,,> Dr Muralimanohar Joshi of
Bharatiya Janta Party <,> Shri S R Bommai <,> of Janata Dal <,> Shri
Harkishan Singh Surjeet of Communist Party Marxist <,> and Shri N K P Salve
of Congress-I Prannoy <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#60:1:A>
Mr Salve let me start with you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#61:1:A>
What do you expect the President to do next <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#62:1:C>
Uh well what I expect President to do next <,> is what he did
the last time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#63:1:C>
Perhaps <,> call for the <,,> party which is the highest number of
members in <,> <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#64:1:C>
<w> That's </w> the only alternative for him <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#65:1:A>
Call for the leader of the party

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#66:1:C>
Good <,> call for the leader of the party

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#67:1:A>
And who is that going to be ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#68:1:C>
Uh well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#69:1:C>
There is no dearth of talents in our party

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#70:1:C>
And the Congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a
leader <,> who knows <,> how honour ourselve <,> how delicate is the task
ahead of us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#71:1:C>
He will be a strong

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#72:1:A>
Not dearth of talent <,> are you talk heavy with leaders in
fact

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#73:1:C>
No in fact <,> we are reasonably <,> balanced on all ends

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#74:1:C>
Which is not top <,> uh heavy nor is it uh <,> top at the bottom
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#75:1:C>
But the question is we realize the responsiblity

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#76:1:C>
We have very delicate responsibility <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#77:1:C>
We own this responsibility <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#78:1:C>
And <w> we'll </w> if we do have to form <,> minority government
<,> then we do know that <,,> we have to form <,> a durable government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#79:1:C>
And a durable government <,> can not be run only on experience and
gimmicks

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#80:1:B>
Yes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#81:1:B>
Where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from <,> in
order to form a government <,,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#82:1:C>
No as I said <,> <w> it's </w> the minority government <w> I'm
</w> expecting at this juncture

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#83:1:C>
<{> <[> If your prediction are correct </[> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#84:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#85:1:C>
Where am I going to get thirty seats <,,> is precisely from
where Mr Joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#86:1:C>
I don't have any other source <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#87:1:C>
Other are the source which all four parties of all the four had

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#88:1:C>
But <,> when I say the <,> President would be sending for the <,,>
leader of a party with the largest number of uh <,> members <,> I do take it
that even if your projections are correct <,> perhaps the Congress Party will
be the first one to be called <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#89:1:A>
Uh Mr Surjeet from your experience in <}> <-> this </-> <+>
these </+> </}> matters how long I mean the country is waiting now for things
to settle down ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#90:1:A>
<w> It's </w> been a long campaign

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#91:1:A>
<w> It's </w> been <,> uh people are pretty tired <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#92:1:A>
They want a bit of uh uh <,> certainty on the political front

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#93:1:A>
How long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to
some kind of <,> uh stability <,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#94:1:D>
It should not take much time <,> because now situation is
pretty bad in the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#95:1:D>
It requires a government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#96:1:D>
There is no government at the moment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#97:1:D>
And Salveji has rightly stated <,> President has no other option
but to call the <,> leader of the <}> <-> biggest </-> <=> largest </=> </}>
party in the Parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#98:1:D>
And then <,> see that uh they take the responsibility

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#99:1:A>
So <w> you're </w> talking about a week or three days or <{>
<[> <O> one or two word </O> </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#100:1:D>
<[> No no not </[> </{> a week <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#101:1:D>
Week is too much <,> <{> <[> too long <,> <w> that's </w> it too
long

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#102:1:A>
<[> Too long </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#103:1:D>
Because the situation is critical in the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#104:1:D>
Now <w> you've </w> <,> <w> we've </w> mentioned about Punjab
problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#105:1:D>
What is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political
parties they are going <&> cough </&> ahead of the <O> one word </O> <&>
cough </&> and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#106:1:D>
So many other problems are there

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#107:1:D>
Situations is very complicated <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#108:1:B>
Please carry on

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#109:1:A>
I want to ask Mr Bommai <,> what is uh <,> you can actually
authoritatively state as being the President of the Janata Dal <,> the
official position of the Janata Dal towards a coalition <,> with the
congress-I ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#110:1:A>
Because they are looking for those thirty seats <,> and you are
going to have them <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#111:1:E>
Now firstly <,,> we respect the verdict of the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#112:1:E>
And <,> <w> they've </w> asked us to <,,> sit in the opposition
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#113:1:E>
And we will be <,,> playing a role of the constructive opposition
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#114:1:E>
So far <,> talk of coalition is prematured in mind <,> unless <,>
it is for the Congress<,>-I to decide what <w> they've </w> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#115:1:E>
Whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain
minority government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#116:1:E>
All those things have to <,> be indicated by Congress <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#117:1:E>
And if there is any indication <,> the National Front and the Left
<,> combined <,> <w> we'll </w> sit together and <,> take a view on that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#118:1:B>
Are you open to the idea of a coalition government of
Congress <,,> ?

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#119:1:E>
No <,> <w> I'm </w> not uh <,> open to that

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#120:1:E>
But <,,> if the situation demands <,,> we will give it a go to the
situation

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#121:1:E>
<w> It'll </w> <,,> in my view uh <,> too early to answer it
unless <,> that they move <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#122:1:A>
<w> You're </w> not ruling it out <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#123:1:B>
<w> You're </w> not ruling it out

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#124:1:E>
No no it comes when <,> you know the whole thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#125:1:E>
Because the country is passing <,> to a very serious crisis <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#126:1:E>
Not financial <,> law and order <,> all things are there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#127:1:E>
And <,> there should be a government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#128:1:E>
And that government <,> should be able to <,> give solutions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#129:1:E>
The <,> when you talk of coalition <,> <w> it's </w> very
difficult to answer because <,> there are issues <,> on which <,> we oppose
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#130:1:E>
And if <,> the party <,> which proposes <,> is agreeable to those
solutions <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#131:1:B>
Other than the common issues Joshijee on which your party can
extend critical suport <,> or constructive support to Congress-I <,> ?

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#132:1:F>
Uh I don't think so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#133:1:F>
Uh we would be sitting in opposition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#134:1:F>
Uh there is no reason <,> and no occasion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#135:1:F>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#136:1:A>
I think Vinod said issues <,> particular issues

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#137:1:F>
Well you see that whenever there are issues uh <,,> <?>
infringing </?> upon national security say there is a war <,> or there is a
calamity of an unprecedented magnitude

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#138:1:F>
Then certainly we extend co-operation <,,> and support to the
government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#139:1:F>
But as of uh <,> in day-to-day <,> normal implementation of
programmes and policy <,> well certainly I don't find that there is any
reason or occassion <,> to extend any support <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#140:1:F>
But for all measures of uh <,> national welfare <,> I mean
certainly agreed to political parties

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#141:1:A>
I think <w> we'll </w> quickly go first to Bombay <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> Murlidhar is waiting

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#142:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#143:1:B>
Murlidhar is waiting over there <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#144:1:G>
The former Chief Minister of Maharashtra <,> who has been
declared winner from Colaba constituency <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#145:1:G>
Mr Antulay <,> you were one of the leading president <,>
attempting to overthrow Mr Pawar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#146:1:G>
What made you <,> suddenly uh <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#147:1:H>
Well I believe <,,> that this assumption unfortunately is not
very correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#148:1:H>
See there could be internal differences <,> in any democratic
set-up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#149:1:H>
Which of course our party claims to <,> have have <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#150:1:H>
But when it comes to a national <,> disaster or calamity <,> all
the local differences <,> even national differences within the party <,> gets
under <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#151:1:G>
What positive sense of insecurity that made you <,> uh mend
fences with Mr Pawar <,> ?

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#152:1:H>
What <,> what exactly do you mean by sense of insecurity <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#153:1:G>
Because you had the patron of Mr Rajeev Gandhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#154:1:G>
Now the scenario is different <,,>

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#155:1:H>
You mean to say that Mr Pawar didn't have the patronage of Mr
Rajeev Gandhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#156:1:H>
I believe everybody has patronage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#157:1:H>
He was our leader <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#158:1:H>
We all accepted him as our leader <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#159:1:H>
The question of patronage <,> if you use that word <,> if you
choose to use it <,,> is not is rather inappropriate

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#160:1:H>
But if you want to choose it <,,> you are welcome to do so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#161:1:H>
But then everybody has his patronage including Mr Pawar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#162:1:H>
So there is no question of Antulay having patronage <,> and not
Pawar <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#163:1:G>
Did Mr <,> <w> Pawar's </w> campaigning <,> uh really help
you <,> ?

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#164:1:H>
Well <,> Mr <w> Pawar's </w> campaigning did help dispell
<,,> the <,> suspicions created by the BJP candidate who was my main rival
<,> that he has the support of the Chief Minister <,> which was not true <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#165:1:H>
And Mr <w> Pawar's </w> presence there <,> and campaign and
canvassing was necessary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#166:1:H>
I mean to that effect

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#167:1:H>
And I think <,> uh we succeeded <,> I mean <,> in that <,> uh
endevour <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#168:1:G>
Would <w> you've </w> lost had it not been for Mr <w> Pawar's
</w> campaigning <,> ?

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-032#169:1:H>
No I don't think I would have lost <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#170:1:H>
That nobody even Mr Pawar also doesn't think that <,> I would have
lost <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#171:1:H>
Even Mr

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#172:1:H>
Pawar won't say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#173:1:H>
In fact uh <,> it was as I said only to <,> dispell the doubts
created <,> in the minds of the people by <,> uh against our own Chief

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#181:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#182:1:A>
So we we were very luky unto night we can actually review <,> the
situation today the about the votes of the different parties <,> uh across
the country

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#183:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> look at the all India vote share of all the
different parties <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#184:1:A>
Now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead <,>
and the vote position is as follows <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#185:1:A>
Thirty-six percent for the Congress-I

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#186:1:A>
<w> That's </w> down to <,> about two percent since last time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#187:1:A>
The BJP <,> thirty-three percent coming <}> <-> <.> seco </.>
</- > <=> second </=> </}> doing extremely well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#188:1:A>
The Janata Dal twelve on its own <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#189:1:A>
The CPM six <,,> and others which is the conglamuration of parties
<,> twenty-three

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#190:1:A>
Now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the
vote change of swing in vote the Congress as I said was down two percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#191:1:A>
The BJP the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#192:1:A>
The Janata Dal suffering quite a set back now really in three
states <,> down by five percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-032#193:1:A>
CPM about up point five to one percent <,,> and others down four
percent <,,> </I>
