Title <,> <mention> Economic Imparities of the New Government  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#3:1:A>
The speaker is <,> <indig> Shri </indig> Prabhakar Angre <,,> </&> 
 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#4:1:A>
Never in the post-Independence history of the country <,,> a  
government <,> has had to face <,,> massive challeges <,> such as the one <,>  
which is two weeks old government of India <,> had to endure with <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#5:1:A>
Though the government <,,> is solidarily responsible <,,> to find a  
solution to economic problem <,,> a lot depends <,,> upon the present finance  
minister <,,> in formulating policies <,> which will take care of the  
situation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#6:1:A>
Our main concern today <,,> is to retain the status of non defaulter  
<,,> in honouring our financial committments <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#7:1:A>
For the first time after Independence <,,> our pay deficit <,> has  
crossed <indig> rupees </indig> ten thousand <indig> crore </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#8:1:A>
Our balance of payment position is critical <,,> mainly <,> due to  
our sluggish growth in export <,,> which have been below the set target <,,>  
and also a declined <,> in <,,> N R I remittances <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#9:1:A>
We have had three successive good monsoons <,,> inspite of these  
<,,> even the usual seasonal decline in prices of food grains <,,> has not  
been experienced <,,> and the inflation <,> has already crossed <,,> double  
digit mark <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#10:1:A>
The economic imparities <,> before the new government are <,,>  
containment of fiscal and revenue deficit <,,> servicing of foreign debt <,,>  
contracting <,> additional foreign debt <,> to tide over the crisis <,,>  
improvement in our foreign exchange reserves <,,> and bringing down the  
inflation rate <,,> to four to five percent <,> within the next two three  
years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#11:1:A>
If politician colleague <,> of our finance minister <,,> allow him  
<,> to adopt pragmatic policies <,,> and do not pressurise him for adopting  
populace measures <,,> he may be able to present a budget <,> which will be  
indicative of his resolve <,> to take up <,> the country from its present  
morale <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#12:1:A>
According to official estimates <,,> the gap between government  
revenue <,,> and its total expenditure <,> represent eight point five percent  
<,> of countrys gross domestic product <,,> which is estimated in the region  
of <indig> rupees </indig> five and eight thousand <indig> crore </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#13:1:A>
Only the revenue deficit <,> which was just <indig> rupees </indig>  
<,> one thousand six hundred and sixteen <indig> crore </indig> <,> in  
nineteen eighty eighty-one <,> shot up to <indig> rupees </indig> <,> twelve  
thousand four hundred and thirty-six <indig> crores </indig> <,> in nineteen  
eighty-nine ninety <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#14:1:A>
Our foreign exchange reserves <,,> which were above <,> seven  
million dollars in nineteen eighty <,,> fell to four million dollars in  
nineteen eighty-nine <,,> and today <,> they are just sufficient <,> to cover  
two weeks import of the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#15:1:A>
Our debts service coverage issue <,> which was eight percent of  
export earnings <,,> in nineteen eighty eighty-one <,,> is now estimated at  
about thirty percent <,> whereas this debt level <,> should not cross twenty  
percent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#16:1:A>
According to a recent <,> world bank report <,,> <w> India's </w>  
<,> trade regime <,> is restrictive <,,> discretionary <,> complex <,> and  
most difficult to administer <,> and hence <,> it needs to be drastically  
over hauled <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#17:1:A>
The world bank <,> has recommended among other measures <,>  
abolition of quantitative restriction on import <,,> cutting custom tariff  
<,,> from an average of hundred and seventeen percents <,,> to not more than  
twenty percent <,> jacking up of excise duties to make up the short fall  
etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#18:1:A>
The recommendations <,> do not appear to be palatable to many <,,>  
but in the absence of a more acceptable alternative <,,> there is no escape  
<,> from accepting the recommendations of the world bank <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#19:1:A>
It will be necessary for the country <,> to change its economic  
policies <,> relevant to the nineties <,,> and make a departure <,> should  
have an extremely close <?> allies of </?> among themselves <,> so as to make  
the maximum use <,> of the available resources <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#20:1:A>
The whole world is vying <,> to attract foreign investment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#21:1:A>
The developed world <,> is waiting for India to open up <,> but it  
will not wait indefinitely <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#22:1:A>
Foreign equity <,> is recently <}> <-> <.> pre </.> </-> <,> <=>  
preferable </=> </}> to foreign loan <,,> and we should loose no time <,> in  
evolving a clear cut policy <,> conducive to attract the foreign investment  
<,> in our country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#23:1:A>
Such a step <,> will reduce our interest burden on foreign loan <,>  
and to that extent <,> our balance of payment position will improve <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#24:1:A>
In view of the establish<,>ment of European economic community <,,>  
<w> India's </w> export <,> will have to face <,,> a fierce international  
competition <,> in terms of prices <,,> quality <,> specification <,> and  
delivery <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#25:1:A>
The country will have to evolve <,> positive policies to boost  
export <,,> including <,,> those considering the trade union <,> which  
sometimes <,> takes some action <,> detremental to keeping delivery schedule  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#26:1:A>
Our present export <,> are <,> only five point five percents <,> of  
gross <,> national product <,> whereas China and Indonesia <,> have achieved  
the percentage of <,> fourteen and twenty-one percents <,> respectively <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#27:1:A>
The recent devaluation of <indig> rupee </indig> <,> is expected to  
give a <,> big boost to export <,,> though other consequences <,> will have  
to be considered <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#28:1:A>
Other important conditionalities <,> prescribed by the world bank  
<,> are export of nine percent in government expenditure <,> and a drastic  
reduction <,> in agricultural subsidy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#29:1:A>
For a popularly elected government <,,> these are going to be hard  
decisions <,> but its reduction in agricultural subsidies <,,> is accompanied  
by an upward revision of <,> procurement prices <,,> so farmers lobby could  
be quitened <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#30:1:A>
It is estimated <,> that the annual outgo on various subsidies <,,>  
including the concealed one <,,> at the centre and state level <,> is nearly  
<indig> rupees </indig> sixty thousand <indig> crores </indig> <,> which  
represent <,> twelve percent of our gross national product <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#31:1:A>
State electricity board <,,> has huge accumulated losses <,,>  
essentially <,,> because they are not allowed to charge <,> commercial rates  
to the consumer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#32:1:A>
In <,> in case of agriculture <,> we loose about forty-five <indig>  
paise </indig> per unit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#33:1:A>
This is the reason <,> why the policies of the government <,> they  
are not economically viable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#34:1:A>
If populism is persued beyond the point <,> it would become counter  
productive and frustrating <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#35:1:A>
Investment made from <,,> borrowed capitals <,> should yield return  
<,,> higher than the interest rate <,> so that <,> they can take care of  
payment of interest <,> and <O> one word </O> of the principal amount <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#36:1:A>
Greater <,> and rising productivity alone <,> can lead the country  
<,> along the path of stability <,> and progress <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#37:1:A>
All these years <,> the policy makers have found it difficult <,>  
to <,,> politically follow <,> what they should have economically followed  
<,> and as a consequence of which our country <,> has turned now to be a high  
cost economy <,> and we are <?> outcast </?> in the global market <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#38:1:A>
In nineteen fifty <,,> India steel price was the cheapest in the  
world <,,> today it is the costliest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#39:1:A>
<mention> Coal India Limited </mention> <,> is over staffed with  
about one <indig> lakh </indig> workers <,,> and there is no political will  
<,> to deal with redundant labour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#40:1:A>
Food subsidies <,> are given to every one <,> irrespective of his  
income bracket <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#41:1:A>
Payment as resources are vested <,> in keeping <,> loss making  
public sector units alive <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#42:1:A>
A big chunk of bank funds <,> is blocked in sick unit <,> which are  
not allowed to die their natural death <,> because of labour conflict <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#43:1:A>
The purpose of world bank suggestive reforms <,,> has been <,> to  
increase the productivity and efficiency of Indian economy <,> upgradation of  
technological base <,> and improve its international competitiveness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#44:1:A>
These are the objectives <,> all of us want to achieve <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#45:1:A>
The suggested reforms package <,> is also gradual <,> and safe <,,>  
making the state regime <,> more transparent <,> less bureaucratic and more  
liberal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#46:1:A>
Thus <,,> it is not to be rejected <,> only because it has a  
conditionality of the world bank <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#47:1:A>
The world bank <,,> will consider a further plan <,,> of five to  
seven billion dollars <,> after examining <,> the austerity measures  
initiated by the government of India <,,> and hence <,> there appears to be  
no escape <,> from choosing the fiscal course <,> that is a part of  
international monitory funds standard prescription <,> for countrys having  
serious balance of payment problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#48:1:A>
In the light of economic imparities <,> we have to address  
ourselves to <,,> the forthcoming budget formulation <,> and its provisions  
must give clear signals <,> to assess international situation <,> that India  
is serious <,> and has the capability to implement <,> some of the harshest  
measures <,> to correct fiscal anomolies in the Indian economy system <,> and  
reform the situation <,> on all fronts <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#49:1:A>
This will convince international creditors <,,> international  
monetary funds and the world bank <,> the need to support India <,> by  
providing <,> the necessary cushions against precarious balance of payment  
position <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#50:1:A>
The budget <,> will have to spell out <,> a long term integrated  
economic policy <,> covering digit matters <,> relating to monetary <,>  
fiscal <,> industrial <,> in which would need a loan of <,,> about ten to  
fifteen billion dollar <,> to plan a definite programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#51:1:A>
Piecemeal assistance <,> may not help much <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#52:1:A>
The budget <,> will have to lay a special emphasis <,> on export  
promotion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#53:1:A>
Presently <,> export documents have to be signed <,> at two hundred  
and fifty places <,> and hundred and eighteen papers have to be completed <,>  
in the estimated time involved in this operation <,> is twenty-two hours <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#54:1:A>
The paper work as ten percent of the cost <,,> in United States  
only five documents are enough <,> for export clearance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#55:1:A>
<w> India's </w> external sectors <,> have seldom seen the type of  
problem which it is now witnessing <,,> and overcoming the same <,> will need  
<,> some very committed action from the government <,,> and unflinching  
support from the opposition parties in the parliament <,,> <&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#56:1:A>
That was a talk in English entitled <,> <mention> Economic  
Imparities of the New Government </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-035#57:1:A>
