The contribution of All India Radio <,> the communication in
the country has been invaluable <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#2:1:A>
However often forgotten <,> are the people and the action behind the
scene <,> that goes in making these programmes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#3:1:A>
In other sense to highlight the significant contribution <,> of
these individuals <,> the All India Radio has instituted <,> the Akashwani
annual award <,> to the best radio production <,> and technical excellence is
here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#4:1:A>
The awards for the year nineteen-ninety represented at a function
<,> in the <w> capital's </w> Siri Fort auditorium <,> on the sixteenth of
February <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#5:1:A>
Here are some excerpts from the function <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-007#6:1:B>
It is gratifying <,,> that this year too <,,> as yesteryears we
have received a large number of entrance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#7:1:B>
There were in all <,,> two hundred and sixty-four entries <,,> in
nine disciplines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#8:1:B>
The number of contenstants <,> in the technical arena <,,> was also
quite high <,> and the competition formidable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#9:1:B>
From this year <,,> we have <,,> <?> Nasakant </?> award <,> for the
best entry on national integration <,,> instituted in the memory of the
valiant broadcaster <,,> who led down his life <,,> in the course of his duty
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#10:1:B>
Yet another award instituted this year <,,> is for the
correspondence of the year <,> award <,,> to recognize the contribution of
AIR corrospondents <,,> both at home and abroad <,,> <O> one word </O> being
one of the <,> important components of the broadcasting activity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#11:1:B>
It is my present duty on this occasion <,,> to gratefully
acknowledge <,> the commendable efforts <,,> put in by the jury <,,>
comprising eminent broadcasters <,,> critics <,,> journalist and artist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#12:1:B>
We in All India Radio are conscious <,,> of the vital role AIR has
to play in the lives of the people <,,> recognizing the inherents <?>
sequence </?> for the strong medium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#13:1:B>
The greater effectively to the common man <,,> and to integrate
local communities <,,> AIR has launched local Radio Stations <,,> may be a
new trend in broadcasting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#14:1:B>
The Assam Radio station <,> which may be termed a <O> one word </O>
Radio station <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#15:1:B>
We present a new concept in the broadcasting in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#16:1:B>
Each local radia station <,,> will <O> one word </O> needs <,,>
talent and aspiration of the local community <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#17:1:B>
It allows greater participation <,> by the natives <,,> and as far
as the role <O> two words </O> concerned <,,> it is for them the modern day
<O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#18:1:B>
Local Radio motivation the masses to strife for better quality of
life <,,> in search of freedom for hunger <,> better <O> one word </O>
adequate housing <,> clean environment <,> good education <O> one word </O>
health <,> and above all <,,> self esteem and dignity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#19:1:B>
I once again <,,> express my sincere gratitude to all the members
of the jury <,,> and <,> especially for the <?> broadcasting </?> <indig>
Shree </indig> <O> two words </O> <,> for being with us in this event <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#20:1:B>
May I now request you sir <,,> to address the gathering <,> and

<indig> Shri </indig> Shinde <,,> <indig> Shri </indig>
Bhatikar <,,> and distiguished members of the audience <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#22:1:C>
Today <,,> is a proud day <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#23:1:C>
For radio professionals <,> a day <,,> where a good number of them
<,,> will receive <,,> the Akashwani Award <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#24:1:C>
They have won <,,> after giving up their best <,,> their <w> year's
</w> best <,,> in effort <,,> and in excellence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#25:1:C>
I am therefore <,,> very happy <,,> to be in your midst <,,> and to
exchange greetings <,> with all of you <,,> and with the award winners <,,>
in particular <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#26:1:C>
AIR has <,,> indeed broken <,,> new ground <,,> in our ideal fields
<,,> and <,> great many strikes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#27:1:C>
The gulf war <,,> has only added to our challenges <,,> even though
<,,> we are not <,> the actual theatre of war <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#28:1:C>
AIR <,,> I must say <,,> has reason to be challenge admirably <,,>
by not only providing to the listening public <,,> news from the battle
fronts <,,> but also <,,> by promoting public awareness <,,> on the
importance <,,> of conserving energy <,,> petrolium products <,,> <O> one
word </O> economy <,,> in national expenditure <,,> as well as of <,,>
fighting the evils <,,> of hoarding <,,> and black marketing <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#29:1:C>
The media <,,> for becoming more and more vulnerable <,,> and media
management <,,> is therefore <,,> becoming increasingly complex <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#30:1:C>
On the one hand <,,> is the paradox <,,> of care air time <,> being
available <,,> and <,> an insatiable demand <,,> for more radio time <,,>
from ever larging <,> ever enlarging an interested <,> groups <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#31:1:C>
The promoters of <,,> anti-cosumerism <,,> the environmentalist
<,,> and a host of other <,> social activists <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#32:1:C>
On the other hand <,,> there is <,,> the growing recognition <,,>
of the importance of media <,,> and their autonomy <,,> and a constant threat
<,,> by extremist elements <,,> the millitants <,,> promoters of violence
<,,> and other anti-social elements <,,> to silence the media <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#33:1:C>
All of us are aware <,,> of how this was brought home to us <,,> in
the tragic assassination <,,> of Lasa Kaur <,,> who like <,,> Casa Blanca
<,,> the boy on the burning death <,,> is too dumb <,,> in the cause of <,,>
keeping the transmission on <,,> and the media flag flying <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#34:1:C>
You may even try this <,,> when you try to produce better
programmes <,,> than your fellow workers <,,> your seniors <,,> your juniors
<,,> and your equals can do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#35:1:C>
This is competition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#36:1:C>
Competition is <,,> when you perform <,,> in comparison <,,> with
another <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#37:1:C>
What you must try for <,,> is excellence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#38:1:C>
Excellence for its own sake <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#39:1:C>
You achieve excellence <,,> <.> ga </.> by competing with yourself
<,,> and not <,,> with another <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#40:1:C>
You achieve excellence <,,> when your <.> sub </.> every subsequent
work <,,> is recognized <,,> to be greater <,,> than your previous work <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#41:1:C>
I wish you all <,,> every success <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-007#42:1:C>
Thank you <,,> <O> applaud </O>
