<ICE-IND:S1B-072#1:1:A>
In the absence of <,> Dr Shastri <,,> for some time <,,> who
had been the guiding spirit <,> for <,> the preparation <,> of text books
<,,> from nineth to <,> twelfth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#2:1:A>
During his absence <,,> we have <,,> done our best <,,> to select
some passages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#3:1:A>
I now welcomes him <,> <-> I we </-> <,> we welcome him <,> to <,>
to take the reins in his hand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#4:1:A>
So <,> just to take a review <,> of what <w> we've </w> done <,> I
would <,> like to <,,> request <,,> professor <,,> Patil-Kulkarni <,> and
<,,> Principal <,> Krishnamurthy <,> to <,> make us <,> rather <,> available
<,> the list of the articles <,> or the passages <,> that have been <,>
selected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#5:1:A>
I <,> request <,> Patil-Kulkarni <,> to <,> give the <,,> brief <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#6:1:B>
According to the plan <,,> evolved by <,,> the board of studies
in English <,,> of said board of <,> secondary and higher secondary <,>
English <,,> Pune <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#7:1:B>
Uh we have <,,> in all seven units <,,> of which <,,> the first unit
is called informative writing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#8:1:B>
The second one is note-making <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#9:1:B>
Third unit is distance communication <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#10:1:B>
But the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#11:1:B>
The fourth unit is <,> reading and responding to advertisements
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#12:1:B>
Workshop is to be done <,> in this <,> next week <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#13:1:B>
And the fifth one is reading newspaper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#14:1:B>
Almost <,,> complete selection has been made <,,> as far as this
particular <,> unit is concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#15:1:B>
And <,,> I may speak <,,> a few words <,> regarding the selection
that has been made <,> and the contents of various <,> items that have
appeared <,> under this unit <,> reading the Newspaper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#16:1:B>
As we all know <,> newspaper forms <,> an essential part of <,>
civilized society <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#17:1:B>
Without newspaper <,> people will be <,> in dark <,> of what has
happened <,> been happening <,> all over the world <,,> and around <,> their
own village or town <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#18:1:B>
And so we thought it <,> essential <,> to <}> <-> <.> intr </.>
introduced </-> <+> introduce </+> </}> this one unit <,,> for the benefit of
<,,> the students <,> studying in <,> twelfth standard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#19:1:B>
We have selected <,,> <-> a </-> various <,> articles <,,>
according to their sections <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#20:1:B>
The sections may be <,> alright <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#21:1:B>
One short news <,,> another <,,> letters to the <,> editor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#22:1:B>
Other forms <,,> a report <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#23:1:B>
And <,,> one form <,> uh the editorial <,> section of <,> the
newspaper <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#24:1:B>
And then another <,> spot news <,,> all these are relevant <,,> to
the understanding of what has been happening around us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#25:1:B>
The first one of these <,,> is about an accident which took place
in Bengal <,> and about forty-one people were killed <,,> in the coal mine
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#26:1:B>
It might have been due to the fire that broke out <,,> and also <,>
due to <,,> carbon monoxide <,> which they breathe <,> and then they died <,>
<O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#27:1:B>
Several bodies have been recovered <,,> where the final report is
not yet available <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#28:1:B>
But then every one has said that about forty-one <,,> miners were
killed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#29:1:B>
Second one is from <,,> <O> one word </O> to <,> the letters to the
editor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#30:1:B>
One writes it about Highway Development <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#31:1:B>
Taking into consideration all development that have been made <,>
recent years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#32:1:B>
The <,> writer opines <,> that <,> we are lagging far behind <,>
perhaps generations behind <,> the other countries <,> our Asian countries
particularly <,> Singapore <,> Indonesia <,> Malaysia etcetera <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#33:1:B>
They have forged far ahead of us <,> in the maintenance of <,> the
highways <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#34:1:B>
So here <,> <?> presented </?> a few <,> developments that have
been taken by <,> the government of India <,> in maintaining <,> the highways
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#35:1:B>
The last two of it <-> is </-> consist spot news <,,> giving
information regarding <w> what's </w> happening at the centre <,,> for the
budget session was opened on the last day of the session <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#36:1:B>
The information is given earlier <,,> and what items could be
included <,> into the session into the small views <,> mentioned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#37:1:B>
We shall come back to it

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#38:1:B>
<w> That's </w> about unit five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#39:1:B>
Unit six deals with persuading <,,> for which <,> others will speak
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#40:1:B>
And seventh unit narrating <,,> would be <,> <-> at </-> <,> spoken
about by <,,> some other person <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#41:1:B>
And then we come to imaginative writing <,,> section two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#42:1:B>
And which contains <,> poems and <,,> other imaginative things <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#43:1:B>
And the last section is <,> rapid reading <,,> which particularly
full of short <,,> short stories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#44:1:B>
And in the earlier section <,> imaginative writing <,,> we have
selected <,,> a number of poems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#45:1:B>
Out of ten I will present <,> only three poems only <,> two or
three poems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#46:1:B>
And in this <,,> another one <,> <mention> Pulley </mention> <,> by
George Herbert <,> which <,> many of the people already know about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#47:1:B>
It tells about <,,> the human being <,> generation and regeneration
<,> and the humanisation or <,> whatever it is <,> in this world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#48:1:B>
<w> They're </w> known to each and everyone I don't think <,> <w>
I'll </w> spent <{> <[> much time on this </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#49:1:A>
<[> You can pass </[> </{> pass over

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#50:1:C>
Pass over <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#51:1:B>
And the next one is <,,> uh by a black poet <,> Oleghe <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#52:1:B>
I feel <,> <mention> A Sudden Storm </mention> <,> the
environmental <,,> situation <,,> presented in this poem <,> is almost
similar to <,> Indian <,> environment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#53:1:B>
Before storm comes <,,> rain comes <,> there is a lull <,> lull
before the storm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#54:1:B>
And children gather <,,> in that lull <,> and the coming sign of
storm <,> people are worried <,> they go in search of their children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#55:1:B>
They are calling them <-> of </-> <,> but the children don't listen
to them

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#56:1:B>
For children love the storm <,> and it is about to rain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#57:1:B>
And suddenly <,> when all the winds are cleared <,> people are
there in their houses <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#58:1:B>
Storm raises <,,> thunder takes over <,> lightning is there and
suddenly it starts pouring down <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#59:1:B>
And <,> children <,> enjoy themselves <,> playing out in the rain

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#60:1:B>
That is a poem <,> by <,> a black poet <,> which is also very
relevant <,> of Indian <,> <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#61:1:B>
After this we go to <,> the rapid reading section uh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#62:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> speak on only <,,> two or three

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#63:1:A>
Fine <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#64:1:B>
Uh <indig> haan </indig> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#65:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#66:1:B>
Uh selected <,> stories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#67:1:B>
One is <,> the well known story <,> <mention> The Cop and the
Anthem </mention> <,> by O Henry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#68:1:B>
This is typical Henrian <,,> uh short story <,> having a twist in
the tale <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#69:1:B>
You know how that is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#70:1:B>
Here <,,> a <O> one word </O> convict <,,> Soapy <,,> he is now
facing <,> an ordeal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#71:1:B>
As the winter was approaching <,> he wanted to find a shelter <,>
warm shelter from that <&> interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#72:1:B>
The best idea was to go back to prison <,> so that <,> he would get
some warm corner there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#73:1:B>
But unfortunately all his efforts <,,> in trying to go back to the
prison <,,> failed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#74:1:B>
Sincere efforts at that <,> but then <,,> when all these things
failed <,> he comes near <,> a church <,,> where prayer was going on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#75:1:B>
And he felt certain trasformation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#76:1:B>
So he decided <,,> to live <,> a honest life <,> put an end to <->
his <,> stop </-> this stealing business <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#77:1:B>
But the moment this transformation came <,> next came the hand of a
cop <,> on his shoulder <{> <[> <O> one word </O> what are you doing here <,>
he says <,> nothing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#78:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#79:1:B>
And the last one that <w> I'm </w> discussing on <,> is
<mention> The Nightingale </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#80:1:B>
<mention> Nightingale </mention> again brings to <,> to our
memories <,> various feelings <,,> that we pines for Nightingale <,> and <,,>
story viewers also have written on Nightingale <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#81:1:B>
This one is <,> by <,> Hans Anderson <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#82:1:B>
This a lengthy story <,> telling about <,,> a bird <,> Nightingale
bird <,> who sings sweetly <,> in some remote corner <,> on the <,> shores
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#83:1:B>
There was an emperor <,> Chinese emperor <,> who has <,> all the
greatest things in the world <,> in his empire <,> in his court <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#84:1:B>
And then somehow he comes to know <,> casually <,,> there is a
wonderful bird <,> singing a <,> very melodious song <,> day and night <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#85:1:B>
He likes to hear that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#86:1:B>
Ultimately the girl who had heard it first <,> persuade this bird
<,> to <}> <-> comes </-> <+> come </+> </}> to <,> <w> King's </w> court
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#87:1:B>
And then <,> the bird sings <,,> to the satisfaction of the great
emperor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#88:1:B>
And <,> this emperor <,,> makes <,> a golden cage for it <,> with
all the amenities <,> and a place <,> a designation in the court honour <,,>
as a court singer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#89:1:B>
The bird everyday goes on singing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#90:1:B>
But this she cannot continue for a long time <,> the bird is also
mortal being <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#91:1:B>
And so <,> to immortalise the song of a bird <,> a genius was there
<,,> scientist <,> who made a machine <,> which would reproduce the song <,>
exactly as Nightingale <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#92:1:B>
When the button was on <,> it will go on singing like Nightingale
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#93:1:B>
And the people appreciated him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#94:1:B>
And then everyone neglected this bird <,> original bird <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#95:1:B>
And the bird felt very sad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#96:1:B>
And it flew away <,> from <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#97:1:B>
And then once this machine is <,> uh that <,,> gets out of order
<,> though it was repaired it could not produce the <,> melodious song as
before <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#98:1:B>
Then the emperor <,,> felt that he was missing this music <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#99:1:B>
And on account of this he fell ill <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#100:1:B>
People went in search of the bird they could not find <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#101:1:B>
Ultimately <,,> the emperor thinks of <,> Nightingale bird <,>
prays the bird <,> to come back to <,> emperor <,> the emperor was on his
death bed <,> so he <+> is </+> only saved <,> by the song of the bird <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#102:1:B>
The bird comes <,> <O> two words </O> from <O> one word </O> of
the window <,> and then <,> sings <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#103:1:B>
The emperor very much <O> one word </O> he started recovering <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#104:1:B>
He only said that <,> we can talk again the whole <O> one word
</O> <,> but <w> it'll </w> come <,,> sometimes <,,> say once in a day <,>
once in a week <,> to sing <,> to the emperor <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#105:1:B>
So this is the story of Nightingale <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#106:1:B>
With these few <O> one word </O> I think <w> I've </w> spoken <,,>
uh within the specified time that was given to me <,,> to review <,,> the
items that have been selected <,> for this particular book <,> for standard
English text book <,> which commence from ninety-five <,,> June <,,> thank
you <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#107:1:A>
Thank you <,,> sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#108:1:A>
Infact <,,> <w> I'm </w> divided between <&> recording broken </&>
these are <,> I should compliment you <,,> or offer my thanks <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#109:1:A>
I <,,> began <,,> that uh <,> you are going to give a kind of
report <,,> and <,,> it was rather a kind of prosiac begining I think <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#110:1:A>
And now I think <,,> when I heard <,,> your review <,> of the <,>
units that <,> you have selected <,> I rather feel <,> that <w> I've </w>
<,,> travelled through the <quote> realms of gold </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#111:1:A>
Thank you <,,> thank you <,> now

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#112:1:C>
Thank you Mr Kaned <,,> for this opportunity given to me <,,>
to review <,,> a few of the lessons <,,> selected by us <,,> for uh <,> the
twelfth class <,> English text <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#113:1:C>
I begin with uh <,,> rapid reading section <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#114:1:C>
We have <,,> selected <,,> about uh <,> ten stories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#115:1:C>
And I feel <,> the main considerations <,,> behind the selection
of these stories <,,> are <,,> number one <,,> the sustained interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#116:1:C>
Two <,> suitability for the age group <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#117:1:C>
Three <,,> the moral orientation <,> the story may have <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#118:1:C>
And <,,> lastly <,> the variety <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#119:1:C>
Of these stories I take first <,,> <mention> Fate <,,> a Woman <,>
and a Ruby </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#120:1:C>
It is a detective story <,,> from the files of <,> Cecil Bishop
<,> C I D <,,> Scotland Yard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#121:1:C>
The story <,,> narrates <,,> in a very gripping <,> manner <,,>
how <,,> Bishop <,,> was able <,> to find out <,> the lost <,> ruby <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#122:1:C>
In this <,,> he makes several efforts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#123:1:C>
And a woman came to his uh <,> <}> <-> age </-> <+> aid </+> </}>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#124:1:C>
But even <,> after uh very long <,,> search <,,> almost <,> he
gave up hope <,,> at that moment <,> Fate came to his <,> uh aid <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#125:1:C>
And with the help of the Fate <,> he was able <,> in the end <,>
to detect <,> this uh <,> lost ruby <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#126:1:C>
<w> It's </w> a very <,> fine <,,> absorbing <,> detective story
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#127:1:C>
But second story <,,> that <w> I've </w> selected is <mention> The
Accursed House </mention> <,,> by Emile <,> Gaboriau <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#128:1:C>
It is a story on human psychology <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#129:1:C>
Vicomte <,,> reduces the rents of <,> the buildings <,> with very
good intention <,> of helping the tenants <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#130:1:C>
But unfortunately <,,> this <,,> intention was misunderstood <,,>
and the people began to smell <,,> something foul <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#131:1:C>
And they thought <,> that there must be some other motive <,>
behind it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#132:1:C>
And then <,,> one after the other <,,> all the tenants <,> desert
the <,> uh house <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#133:1:C>
And thus the house becomes an accursed <,> house <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#134:1:C>
The third story <,> <mention> The Fortune tellers </mention> <,,>
which is a folk tale <,,> it tells about <,> story of uh <,,> scholars <,,>
who <,,> out of their greediness <,,> ruined themselves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#135:1:C>
The fourth story <,,> is uh <mention> Foolish Friends </mention>
<,,> by Premchand <,> one of the famous <,> Indian short short story writer
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#136:1:C>
He describes <,,> how sometimes <,,> even <,,> good friends <,>
with good intention <,,> may become embarrassing <,,> to the extent of even
ruining <,,> the people <,> whom they want to <,> help <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#137:1:C>
Here it is about <,,> few boys I mean <,> two boys <,> I mean one
boy and the girl <,> who out of their curiosity <,> and also out of their
intention to help them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#138:1:C>
Uh eggs in the nest <,> ultimately <,> ruin it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#139:1:C>
And the <,> the next story <mention> Once Upon A Christmas
</mention> <,> by Pearl Buck <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#140:1:C>
He is very absorbing absorbingly narrated story <,> of a boy <,>
who comes to the writer <,> on the eve of uh <,> Christmas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#141:1:C>
And she <,,> adopts him <,,> she becomes grownup <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#142:1:C>
And he becomes a doctor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#143:1:C>
And afterwards there were troubles in China <,,> China splits <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#144:1:C>
And uh <,> Pearl Buck <,> wanted to return <,> home <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#145:1:C>
She wanted <,> the boy also <,> to accompany her <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#146:1:C>
But he refused <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#147:1:C>
And <,> he wants to stay back in China <,,> doing self-less
service <,> to the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#148:1:C>
She tells him <,> that the communist may not allow him <,,> to do
the type of uh service <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#149:1:C>
But he says <,> he is determined to stay <,> whatever may happen
to <,> him <,>

Ultimately he is uh <,> shot dead <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#151:1:C>
And uh <,,> after these few stories <,> I want to take up <,,> one
or two poems <,,> that <w> I've </w> uh <,> the opportunity of selecting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#152:1:C>
One is <,,> the poem <mention> What Kind of A <,,> Place
</mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#153:1:C>
<mention> What Kind of Place </mention> <,> this is by <,> Uma
Parmeshwaran <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#154:1:C>
This is a satire <,,> on uh modern life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#155:1:C>
Now <,> we find <,,> all the windows and the doors of the house
<,> shut <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#156:1:C>
And the curtains withdrawn

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#157:1:C>
The curtains <,,> and no breeze comes in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#158:1:C>
We don't have the opportunity of seeing uh <,> the <,> natural uh
beauty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#159:1:C>
And uh even <,> our way of life is so changed <,,> that there is
no distinction between man and uh <,,> woman as far as social life is
concerned

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#160:1:C>
They move <,> they move together they mix with each other <,,>
which <,> for an <,> old <,,> father <,> looks very odd <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#161:1:C>
And even <,,> cooking <,> is done once for uh <,> in a month <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#162:1:C>
And <,> he expresses <,> his displeasure <,,> for this life <,,>
and uh <,> he wants his son to open <,> the windows and the door <,> so that
he can have the opportunity <,> to <,> breathe fresh air <,> and see <,>
nature in all its splendour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#163:1:C>
And the <,,> next poem is <mention> The <w> Whiner's </w> Plaint
<,,> in search of identity </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#164:1:C>
This poem is about <,,> an Indian <,,> who is not known as Indian
in his uh country <,> but known as <,,> a <indig> Madrasi </indig> or a
Brahmin or a Hindu or a Muslim <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#165:1:C>
And uh he doesn't feel happy <,> with these labels <,,> that are
attached <,,> to that <,> persons <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#166:1:C>
And he wants <,> to be known <,,> only as <,> an Indian <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#167:1:C>
And these are the <,> two poems <,> on which <,> I wanted to <,>
say a few words <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#168:1:C>
And thank you very much for this opportunity given <,> <O> two
words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-072#169:1:A>
In fact <,,> story has been the <,> first love <,> of every
generation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#170:1:A>
And uh <,> with so much visualisation <,,> and uh <,> rather so
much pain staking labour <,> we have selected <,> the stories <,> with
variety of subjects <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#171:1:A>
And <,> we feel no doubt <,> that these would be <,> very
interesting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#172:1:A>
In fact <,,> the stories are interesting <,,> but the story
telling was also interesting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#173:1:A>
And therefore for a moment <,> we thought <,> that the time <,>
had stopped <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#174:1:A>
When <,,> you <,,> switched to <,> poetry <,,> and as I know <,>
that it is your first love <,,> and <,,> the way you <,,> said something
about the poem that you have selected <,,> has aroused curiosity <,> in our
mind <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#175:1:A>
And it would be <,> appreciated by the students <,> at large <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#176:1:A>
I am reminded again <,,> of the <,,> <O> one word </O> seed <,>
that may sprout <,,> and flower <,> when the text books <,> comes into light
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-072#177:1:A>
Thank you very much <,> thank you </I>
