<I>  
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#1:1:A>
<w> We're </w> assembled here <,> this evening <,> to <,>  
discuss <,> the aftermath or perhaps <,> the most reveting diplomatic  
engagement <,> involving <,> India and Pakistan <,> <}> <-> on </-> <=> over  
</=> </}> that Kashmir issue <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#2:1:A>
This is a subject <,> which has really engaged <,> the entire  
<w> sub-continent's </w> attention <,> for almost uh <,> six weeks I should think  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#3:1:A>
And uh <,> towards the end <,> it came to almost a nail biting  
finish <,> with the fate of the resolution 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#4:1:A>
The Pakistan sponsored resolution <,> uh condemning India <,> for  
alleged Human Rights violation in Kashmir <,> becoming a subject of  
international attention <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#5:1:A>
And <,> it has been uh <,> sort of great satisfaction <,> uh in this  
country <,> that at the end of a day <,> under uh <,> international pressure  
<,> particularly pressure from <,> other Third World countries <,> Iran and  
China in particular <,> that Pakistan <,> uh withdrew the resolution 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#6:1:A>
And <,> uh it is <,> <w> it's </w> not quite something that <,> need  
necessarily be interpreted as <,> a victory or defeat 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#7:1:A>
But it was question of uh larger Third World solidarity <,> that uh  
was established in Geneva 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#8:1:A>
And <,> the another major point that came out <,> at the end of the  
Geneva Conference was that certain issues like this <,> perhaps which will  
<+> be </+> resolved <,> uh through bi-lateral negotiations 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#9:1:A>
This gives a completely new opening <,> and <,> to discuss uh <,>  
the fallout of Geneva <,> how we move forward from here and <,> what is being  
what is the reason <,> why India was ultimately able to pursue <,> other  
member countries of the <,> United Nations Human Rights Commission 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#10:1:A>
Uh <,> to support that the Indian position of this <,> we have uh a  
very distinguished panel here today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#11:1:A>
Uh Mr Salman Khursheed <,> the hero of Geneva <,> who has uh <,>  
almost uh I would say battled <,> night and day <,> to prevent the uh  
Pakistani <,> uh diplomatic victory in Geneva <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#12:1:A>
Uh despite the fact that Pakistan has <,> uh in the past <,> uh  
scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena <w> it's </w> been uh  
very very <O> one word </O> achievement Salman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#13:1:A>
And next to Mr Khursheed is Mr S K Singh <,> former Foreign  
Secretary who has also dealt with Pakistan for a very long time 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#14:1:A>
I think <,> uh uh apart from having spent time in Pakistan <,>  
itself uhm as <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#15:1:B>
I started in fifty-nine <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#16:1:A>
In fifty-nine 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#17:1:B>
<O> One or two words </O> <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#18:1:A>
A very long time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#19:1:A>
And <w> we've </w> also with us Mr Rasheed Talib <,> senior  
journalist with Aligarh background <,> who has also been uh a commentor <,>  
on national and international affairs <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#20:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> start with Salman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#21:1:A>
Salman uh <,> the question that has uh occured to me <,> time and  
again <,> is <,> how did we do it ? 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#22:1:C>
From start till the end <,> I think there was a <?> scale <?/>  
by we finish this eager expections on <}> <-> one </-> <=> one </=> </}> hand  
<,> on the other hand <,> we were also kind of uh <,> preparing ourselves for  
defeat <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#23:1:C>
There was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution <?>  
target </?> pass <,> have its own fault <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#24:1:C>
So we work absolutely short 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#25:1:A>
So could you tell us little background of this 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#26:1:A>
How is that <?> we </?> <+> how </+> was this achieved <,,> ? 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#27:1:C>
So <w> I've </w> my own <?> amnesia </?> <O> laughter </O> I  
uh <,> I I was quite confident I think our whole team was quite confident  
that <,> we had uh <,> a margin <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#28:1:C>
A clear margin right upto the last date <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#29:1:C>
Uh perhaps on the day of the voting <,> the morning of the voting  
<,> uh we <?> sleep </?> a little bit 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#30:1:C>
A couple of people <,> uh <?> slipped </?> <,> perhaps due to last  
munute instruction 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#31:1:C>
But <,> it was our margin <,> that we maintained throughout <,> uh  
which was significant 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#32:1:C>
And I think important in <,> leading to the situation which finally  
led to uh withdrawl <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#33:1:C>
Uh but I think what is significant is the support that we had from  
the European Union <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#34:1:C>
Uh largely <,> because of the report that <O> one word </O>  
ambassadors had <,> had given them <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#35:1:C>
And also the support we had in the <?> O I C </?> group <,> where  
it became very clear <,> after the first few rounds of <,> of discussions we  
had <,> that they were not going to take a unified single position <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#36:1:C>
And certainly the resolution of the <?> O I C </?> Karachi was not  
going to be <,> uh the guiding sort of spirit <,> of their decision <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#37:1:C>
I think that <,> broke the back really off <,> uh the effort by  
Pakistan <,> to get the momentum <,> uh that could convince <,> uh people  
that they could win 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#38:1:A>
But you know there has been suggestion from the Pakistani side  
<,> and I think there are people in this country too who uh <,> feel that  
actually <,> how we managed it was the deal <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#39:1:A>
The so called deal <,> that India was supposed to have struck with  
Iran and China <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#40:1:A>
Uh and <w> that's </w> what really tilted uh <,> the balance that  
Pakistan <}> <-> was have </-> <,> <=> was forced </=> </}> to withdraw <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#41:1:A>
How far is that correct ? 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#42:1:C>
Well I <,> <w> I'm </w> not quite sure that I wouldn't have  
said the same thing if I was in their shoes going back to their country 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#43:1:C>
Uhm I want to make it absolutely clear <,> absolutely clear <,>  
that there was no deal <,> no negotiation <,> no settlement <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#44:1:C>
We didn't meet <,> Iran or China any more than we met the other  
countries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#45:1:C>
We talked uh very openly <,> and we talked about our position <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#46:1:C>
All that Iran did <,> at the time when they ask for adjournment <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#47:1:C>
<O> One word </O> Pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh  
<,> Iran 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#48:1:C>
And Iran said it was being asked by Pakistan <,> was they rang us  
and said want to make a statement <,> to which there will be a response from  
Pakistan and they will withdraw <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#49:1:C>
We said <,> uh lest you waste your breath <,> there are a few point  
on which we will object <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#50:1:C>
Uh we don't allow anybody to say that <,> about the situation in  
Kashmir <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#51:1:C>
For the rest if you have something with Pakistan <,> <w> we'll </w>  
sit and listen to it 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#52:1:C>
But <w> we're </w> not <,> repeat not part of any tripartite <,> or  
bilateral agreement on this <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#53:1:C>
And that was it <,> they made a statement <,> uh China picked it up  
<,> others spoke <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#54:1:C>
Clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#55:1:C>
It should remain in the bilateral plain <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#56:1:C>
Pakistan then said <quote> we agree <,> uh we don't want any  
further actions on our motion </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#57:1:C>
That was it <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#58:1:A>
Mr Singh do you think that uh <,,> there could have been  
something more than what Salman is saying ? 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#59:1:B>
No I don't uh I don't believe that <,> I I from my experience  
<,> Pakistan <,> after the kind of efforts it made <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#60:1:B>
Let me remind you <,,> third committee resolution <,> withdraw <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#61:1:B>
After that end of the <,> the session <,> of the UN General  
Assembly <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#62:1:B>
Immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions <,> sent  
to all members uh capitals of all members <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#63:1:B>
Then the Prime Minister identified herself <,> Prime Minister of  
Pakistan <,> identified herself with this dark project <,> as <,,> completion  
of her <w> father's </w> work <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#64:1:B>
And thereafter she goes there herself <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#65:1:B>
Then all this feverish statements being made all over Pakistan <,>  
all over their media <,> and her <,,> the pitch getting higher and higher <,>  
then they hoping that it would <,> encourage the militants in the Valley <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#66:1:B>
And then what happens <,> towards the end they withdraw their  
pivotal of sentence on which they had <,> based their entire strategy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#67:1:B>
That is to send a <?> self </?> finding mission <,> against <w>  
India's </w> wishes <,> into a good part of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#68:1:B>
Then that is withdrawn 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#69:1:B>
And then <,> they <O> one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#70:1:B>
Actually I think China and uh Iran <,,> good very good friends of  
ours and <,> much better friends of Pakistan <,> gave them <,> and <?>  
totalling </?> <,> or to save their face <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#71:1:B>
Because I I came in here as a minister <,> that uh <,,> that uh <,>  
Pakistan would have lost this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#72:1:B>
Now <,> why it happened <,,> is something we must generalise <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#73:1:B>
Because internationalising this <,> dispute <,> has <,> a kind of  
chain reaction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#74:1:B>
It took it to Human Rights <,,> then take it to the General  
Assembly 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#75:1:B>
And then in the General Assembly nudge it to the Security Council  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#76:1:B>
That was the game plan <,> and I won't be surprised if it remains a  
game plan <,,> for future <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#77:1:A>
Not <?> complacently </?> <,> we shouldn't become complacent  
as S K has rightly emphasised 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#78:1:A>
But the question that <,> a lot of people ask I guess <,> that  
whether in fact there was a withdrawl <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#79:1:A>
Taken into view a withdrawl on which I wish the minister would shed  
some light because some people say <,> that at the very last minute the  
chairman <,,> of it was the Dutch chairman <,> who said <,> <quote> what is  
being deferred <,> that Iranians made a short speech because we objected  
</quote> and uh <,> eventually he said <quote> it is not on the agenda <,>  
for this uh session </quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#80:1:A>
Now what is that the we <O> a few words </O> <,> 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#81:1:C>
Well you know uh what you do with a resolution <,> is that the  
resolution is voted <,> uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a  
vote <,> uh it could be defeated it could be accepted <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#82:1:C>
Once a resolution is accepted <,> then it gets on to the record 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#83:1:C>
And a resolution of the kind they wanted <,> was <,,> <?> self </?>  
serving resolution <,> that automatically will repeat itself every year with  
a report but <,,> uh <?> serving </?> from a fact finding instruments on <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#84:1:C>
What uh <,> you can do to kill a resolution <,> apart from  
defeating it is to bring a no-action motion <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#85:1:C>
Uh which is not the preferred instrument now <,> lot of countries  
in the West <,> preferring not to uh <,> to block <,> action as it works <,>  
through through indirect uh <,> sort of method <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#86:1:C>
So <w> we've </w> not uh <,> thought of a no-action motion 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#87:1:C>
We wanted to be <,> consistent without transparency <,> uh attitude 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#88:1:C>
We wanted to be consistent with openness <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#89:1:C>
And we said nothing to hide <,> no blocks <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#90:1:C>
<w> Let's </w> face it in <,> uh openly <,> let the best man win  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#91:1:C>
What Iran has said <,> was specifically <,> uh uh request the  
Pakistan to withdraw <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#92:1:C>
I had said then that the commission be <,> treat this matter as  
closed <,> after Pakistan withdraw it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#93:1:C>
What the chairman did <,> was to take the request to Pakistan to be  
the operative part of the request to the commission <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#94:1:C>
And therefore rule so <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#95:1:C>
We immediately protested <,> and I must give credit to Iran and I  
think this is an act of courage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#96:1:C>
Because actually what they could have said <quote> well we try to  
help <,> but it was ambiguous you know <w> it's </w> no fault of ours  
</quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#97:1:C>
Iran took courage <,> instantly in his act 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#98:1:C>
The ambassador uh <,> <O> one or two word </O> said <quote> look  
what I said sir <,> was <,> that this matter be treated as closed <,> no <,>  
action <,> no <,> further action <,> period </quote> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#99:1:A>
So obviously there was no choice <,> 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#100:1:C>
Uh chairman said <quote> yes I agree <,> if that is the case  
<,> then no-action period </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#101:1:C>
Everybody clapped and it was over <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#102:1:C>
That if <,> no <,> <?> any more </?> <,> in of resolution that can  
leave on after this <,> to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#103:1:C>
But of course this week <,> like anybody else we are going in for  
new resolution 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#104:1:B>
Well one thing Chandran <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#105:1:B>
Uh to this question <,> that during this very session <,> there  
was another resolution pssed by consensus <,> that was anti-terrorist <,> <{>  
<[> ahn right <,> and therefore in this particular session <,> on this two  
aspects of our problem <,> terrorism which is being injected <,> inserted  
into India etcetera etcetera <,> <}> <-> <.> ex </.> </-> <=> exported </=>  
</}> into India <,> on the one hand <,> and the human rights question on the  
other hand <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#106:1:B>
Human rights question is wiped off <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#107:1:B>
During the session terrorism thing <,> stand as a decision of the  
commission 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#108:1:A>
<[> Ahn right </[> </{> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#109:1:A>
Rasheed would you agree that the Human Rights <,> question  
has been wiped off <,> ? 
 
<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#110:1:D>
Well I think these are technicalities <,> what the minister  
has just said may be right on it <,> <w> that's </w> what happened <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#111:1:D>
But I think <,> we should 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#112:1:A>
<O> A few words </O> 
 
<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#113:1:D>
As we were saying earlier <,> that we should not become  
complacent 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#114:1:D>
Because <,> <w> it's </w> likely to come <,> up again <,> at  
various other forum <,> and if it does <,> what is going to be our strategy 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#115:1:D>
In other words <,> what was a strategy that worked here <,> and  
what should we do <,> in order to <,,> you know <,> take care of it next time  
<,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#116:1:A>
Right <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#117:1:A>
Yes Salman I I think one question as writer point of view  
commented that perhaps <,> okay <w> we've </w> <,> succeeded <,> uh it has  
been a great achievement <,> but uh <,> this is not going to stop Pakistan  
<,> from its attempt to internationalise <,> uh Kashmir that is that is the  
possession <,> uh because uh having a democracy existing <,> then we <,> we  
double <,> the effort <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#118:1:A>
Now do <w> we've </w> a game plan <,> as to how <w> we're </w>  
going to confront this in future <,> ? 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-031#119:1:C>
Well on two things <,> I would like to say one uh which uh I  
would uh point you <,> through S <w> K's </w> notice 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#120:1:C>
Because he has <,> far great experience of <,> bilateral work 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#121:1:C>
Uh <,> which is that despite our confidence that we would win <,>  
there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#122:1:C>
Uh the important thing is that if we had <,> had a vote <,> uh ten  
or twelve people would have voted <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#123:1:C>
But the margins would not have been great <,> we would not  
necessarily have known how the others felt <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#124:1:C>
They would abstain it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#125:1:C>
Pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they  
were in our favour <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#126:1:C>
We could have got one or two <,> perhaps explanations of vote that  
could indicate what the mood was <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#127:1:C>
But what happened in this uh event <,> was that many country spoke  
<,> and expressively stated that this was a <,> bilateral matter <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#128:1:C>
That this should remain bilateral it should not come in <O> two  
words </O> of an atmosphere of <,> a place like Human Rights Commission <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#129:1:C>
I think this was a significant victory and I think <w> we've </w>  
to take <,> a cue from this <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#130:1:C>
Uhm <,> in terms of strategy <,> not victory in terms of <,> you  
know between India and Pakistan <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#131:1:C>
Uhm <,> the the second important think really is the transparency  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#132:1:C>
It was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#133:1:C>
It is a policy consistent policy <,,> which uh has <,> has input  
at every level ministry of home <,> ministry of defence <,> decision at the  
highest level in our country the prime <w> minister's </w> level <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#134:1:C>
That we must be open and we must be transparent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#135:1:C>
We must not hide <,> if there is nothing to hide <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#136:1:C>
And if there is something wrong <,> the transparency will bring it  
to our notice as well <,> 

<ICE-IND:S1B-031#137:1:C>
