<ICE-IND:S1B-035#1:1:A>
Almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the
challenge of population <,> aging or <,> the growth of the number of older
persons in any society or population <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#2:1:A>
Death appears to be more or less a universal phenomenon and it is
referred to as demographic transition <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#3:1:A>
In the century to come <,> this isssue of <,,> population aging <,>
will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#4:1:A>
In India for example at present <,> the number of people in our
society in the sixty plus age group is some fifty-five million <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#5:1:A>
In about thirty years <,> the number could well be <,>
two hundred million <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#6:1:A>
The first international conference on aging is to be held and in
fact being held in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#7:1:A>
At this time <,> we have with us in our studios today two eminent
experts in the field of aging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#8:1:A>
May we introduce them to you

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#9:1:A>
We have first on my far right <,> Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale who is
the president of the International Federation <,> on Aging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#10:1:A>
And then we have <,> immediately to my right Dr K B Gangarade
former Vice <,> Pro-Vice-Chancellor Delhi University and a United Nation
expert on <,> aging

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#11:1:A>
I can't think of anything else to call your designation <O> laughs
</O> <O> a few words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#12:1:B>
Quite right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#13:1:A>
I use that I for what <,> uh uh many other <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#14:1:A>
Uh may we begin with you Dr <,> Gokhale

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#15:1:A>
There is an International Federation on aging <,> which is the
moving spirit behind this conference recently being held in Bombay and Pune
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#16:1:A>
Would you tell us about this International Federation ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#17:1:B>
Yes this federation was established <,,> about twenty-five
years ago <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#18:1:B>
<w> We've </w> about hundred countries <,,> in membership of this
organization <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#19:1:B>
We have about twenty international agencies which are in membership
of this organization <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#20:1:B>
We are interested <,> in programmes <,> at the policy level which
means <,,> we have conferences <,,> we have research programmes in medical as
well as non-medical subjects <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#21:1:B>
We have publications <,,> and the field programmes <,> or the
grass-root programmes <,> are really developed at the country level <,>
where we provide the necessary technical know-how <,> and support <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#22:1:B>
And we also act <,,> as <,> a body <,,> which is consulted by the
United Nations <,> on the subject of population aging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#23:1:B>
That is what is the broad description of this <,> organization <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#24:1:A>
Dr Gokhale there is also an Indian Federation of Aging <,> <{>
<[> yeah <,> what about this organization ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#25:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#26:1:B>
Indian Federation of Aging was started about five years ago
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#27:1:B>
They are interested in developing old age homes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#28:1:B>
But old age home is a concept which is becoming out of date <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#29:1:B>
So now they are developing day care centres <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#30:1:B>
They also have their own publication called <,> <indig> <mention>
Kanchan-Kalp </mention> </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#31:1:B>
They also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the
country <,> which are working in the field of aging

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#32:1:B>
They co-ordinate them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#33:1:B>
They are also in the area of development of policy <,> and
advocates <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#34:1:B>
That is briefly the role of the Indian Federation of Aging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#35:1:B>
And in addition to Indian Federation there are other five-member
agencies such as <indig> <mention> Lok-Kalyan Samitee </mention> </indig> in
Delhi <,> and other <,> which work in this particular area <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#36:1:A>
Dr Gangarade <,> uh you are an expert on aging again Sudhir
before you take over <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#37:1:B>
As a expert

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#38:1:A>
But there is a global dimension <,> to this demographic
transition through which so many societies are passing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#39:1:A>
<indig> Kyon ke jitni bhi samay <,> jitne bhi samaj hai lagta hai
ke jo <,> bujurg umr ke loog hai unki sankhya badhti jarahi hai </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#40:1:A>
What are the global dimensions of this issue <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#41:1:C>
Let me tell you first <,,> by two thousand <,> AD <,>
eighty-six percent of the <,,> old people <,> will be found only in the Asian
region <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#42:1:C>
We can say dimension of the Asian region <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#43:1:C>
If you take the whole world as such <,> about fifty-six percent of
the people old in the <,,> whole world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#44:1:C>
From that particular point of view <,> ninteen-eighty to two
thousand <,> the <,> period will be <,> that the population of the old people
<,> will be much more <,> than the young and the younger <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#45:1:C>
In fact if you take third world as such <,> <-> there is a </-> <,>
somewhere there is a very good formula <,,> <w> that's </w> <,> third age
<,,> plus <,,> third world <,,> and third is it equivalent to third class <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#46:1:C>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#47:1:C>
Well you see <-> a </-> <,,> and that means <,> the kind of changes
which were odd in the <O> one word </O> <,,> they are most <,> the old people
<,,> after modernization has done not the time to do it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#48:1:C>
In fact modernization <,,> has been <,> a kind of a curse to the
old people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#49:1:C>
Both <,> in the western and industrial society <,> as well as in
<,> our society also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#50:1:C>
In the western society <,> the young is <,> accepted <,> because he
is a productive element <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#51:1:C>
But <+> the </+> moment <-> the </-> one becomes old <,> he <,> <?>
dis </?> out of the <,> you can say productive <,> market <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#52:1:C>
That he is not a productive market <,> he is not respected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#53:1:C>
So whatever we hear <,> it is true <,> that whenever we talk of the
old age <,> let me slightly say here <,> that the concept of aging must
change <,> in the sense <,,> there are some people <,,> who may have what I
call the functional age <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#54:1:C>
That even after the age of hundred years <,> they are active <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#55:1:C>
We can have a number of example that before eighty eighty-five <,>
the <O> one or two word </O> may be more <-> a </-> active than on the
fortieth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#56:1:C>
There may be some people <,> who are not so much active <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#57:1:C>
For it is it is not a chronological age that becomes important <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#58:1:C>
But what is the age become important personal age <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#59:1:C>
So to what extent you can <O> one word </O> functionally important
<,> depends <,> that is it possible <,> youngster living the sixty year fifty
year age the retirement age

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#60:1:C>
Because what we call <,> retired <,,> not the reason of old but he
is retired because of the chronological age <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#61:1:C>
So they all <}> <-> <.> majo </.> </-> <=> major </=> </}> problem
is <,> to what extent we can continue to make the old people <,> as a
productive agent of the society

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#62:1:C>
Thereby <,> they retained their status <,> thereby they retained
their spirit <,> thereby also they become proud of themselves <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#63:1:A>
Dr Gangarade may I interrupt at this stage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#64:1:A>
As far as I can see it there are two <,> primary causes for this
<,> global phenomenon <,> of demographic transition about old people in
society

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#65:1:A>
The first would be <,> declining fertility rate and the second
possibly <,> increase in life expectency <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#66:1:A>
That being so <,> what are the repercussion <,> on a <w> country's
</w> socio-economic structure of this phenomenon of aging ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#67:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> ask Dr Gangarade

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#68:1:C>
The most important point to remember <,> let us identify three
factors which are <,> which are very important

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#69:1:A>
Okay <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#70:1:C>
One is <w> let's </w> say <,> <O> one word </O> Indian society
itself

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#71:1:C>
At one time there was no occupational difference <,> between the
old and the young <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#72:1:C>
Whatever the father did the <,> son did the same thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#73:1:C>
Now with the technological change <,> there is a lot of
occupational differences <}> <-> taken </-> <+> taking </+> </}> place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#74:1:C>
Similarly with the migration <,,> some time old people remains in
the <,,> village and the younger persons comes to the <,> town <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#75:1:C>
So that is <-> the </-> another problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#76:1:C>
Third is also our individualistic way of life is also gradually
<,,> taken place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#77:1:C>
To that extent the first socio-economic problem is <,,> what I call
it if you take into <,> four <,> four kind of formula or criteria <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#78:1:C>
If an old person is physically sound <,,> if the old person is also
economically <,> happy or healthier <,,> that is economically sound <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#79:1:C>
Socially and mentally if he is also alert <,> then that old person
becomes a wanted person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#80:1:C>
But if you minus each of these <,> than becomes an unwanted person
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#81:1:C>
But what happens even a let us say in our society <,> where still
the relationships are certainly maintained <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#82:1:C>
Because even if you see <,> sometime even though the <,> uh younger
may not like the older people <,> but the older people wants to remain with
their grand children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#83:1:C>
That kind of emotional tie is is remaining there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#84:1:C>
So but <,,> the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round
when I use the word all-round <,,> prices <,> see in a city the housing
problem etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#85:1:C>
So sometimes the younger people begin to feel <,> either the old
people should remain in the village <,> or get out of the house as <,> soon
as possible <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#86:1:C>
To give you a very concrete example <,,> in one of my surveys I
found <,,> that even the father in Delhi <,,> is welcome for three days <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#87:1:C>
If after fourth day remains <-> the </-> both the <,,> in-laws that
is daughter <,> otherwise son-in-law begins to feel there is something wrong
somewhere and he must <,> get out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#88:1:C>
So even the father is not <,> welcome to

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#89:1:C>
Why ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#90:1:C>
Because firstly the scarcity of the space in the <,> in the house
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#91:1:C>
Secondly also because now- a-days <,> the <-> rate </-> prices are
high <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#92:1:C>
Economically it is not possible <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#93:1:C>
But what happens is why sometimes they are welcoming <,> when they
both are working wife and husband <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#94:1:C>
Sometime they feel <,> to have the old people is good <,> so that
they can do baby-sitting job <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#95:1:C>
So the <,,> <indig> yane </indig> <,> most perhaps they begin to
feel <,> that old people are needed for a baby-sitting job <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#96:1:A>
Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale <indig> agala prashna apke liye hai
</indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#97:1:B>
<indig> Ji kahiye </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#98:1:A>
<indig> Kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo
hai uspar kya prabhav padta hai is <,> uh prashna ka </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#99:1:A>
I <}> <-> I means </-> <+> mean </+> </}> <w> I'm </w> little
reluctant to refer to it as a problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#100:1:A>
<{> <[> But </[> aging is not really a problem <w> it's </w> an
issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#101:1:A>
So <}> <-> <.> wha wha </.> </-> <=> what </=> </}> will be the
impact on the economic health of the country <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#102:1:B>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#103:1:B>
Basically Deepakjee <,> uh once <,> you have a large
population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket <,,> the
dependency ratio starts increasing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#104:1:B>
Many thereby should take the <}> <-> continue </-> <+>
continuation </+> </}> of life <,> from zero to hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#105:1:B>
There are more people at the younger age who depend on the people
who earn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#106:1:B>
Similarly there is a larger group of people above the age of sixty
<,> <w> who're </w> depending <,> on the earnings of the fewer people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#107:1:B>
Which means <,,> that more people are dependent <,> on the
earnings of fewer people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#108:1:B>
Which is a basically <,> economic problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#109:1:B>
And countries like Japan <,> are really facing this problem very
<}> <-> serious </-> <+> seriously </+> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#110:1:B>
The other issue is <,,> the issue of pension <,> graduity or
social security <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#111:1:B>
Social security <,> presently is only for the organized sector of
society <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and not for the <}> <-> <.> unorga </.> </-> <=>
unorganized </=> </}> sectors like the landless labours or the <,> small
farmer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#112:1:B>
So how to provide security to these groups is another issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#113:1:B>
And thirdly most of the countries in the West <,,> are finding
<,,> that pension is no more an answer <,,> to <,,> meet the needs of the
people who are sixty plus <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#114:1:B>
And therefore they are finding or searching for new ways <,>
whereby pension could be replaced <,,> by some funding while they are earning
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#115:1:B>
Also the other issue related to this <,> uh uh by pension and
provident fund etcetera <,,> is providing the third career to the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#116:1:B>
Now the <,> uh most of the countries in the West are trying to
encourage people <,,> to take up a new assignment at the age of forty

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#117:1:B>
They can change jobs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#118:1:B>
And lastly <,> they are trying to prepare people for so called
retirement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#119:1:B>
They start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five
<,> so that he can develop some alternatives <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#120:1:B>
At the age of fifty-six they will give him two days off like that
<,> at the age of sitxy years he is totally ready <,,> to change job

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#121:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#122:1:A>
In other words <,> Dr Gokhale <,> the time at which <,> at
the age at which the person withdraws from the labour force <,> should this
be after discussion of some agency like the government <,> or of the
individual himself

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#123:1:B>
It has got to be with the individual <,> and not with any
government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#124:1:B>
Because whether you are able to work or not <,> is something you
can decide <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#125:1:B>
In India for example a businessman doesn't <}> <-> retired </->
<+> retire </+> </}> untill he himself feel that he has to retire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#126:1:B>
Farmers doesn't retire <,,> and politicians you know they just
don't retire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#127:1:B>
So point is if a person feels that he should retire <,> certainly
he should retire <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#128:1:B>
But if he feels that he can work <,,> I I remember Deepak mm mm
<,> incident recently

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#129:1:B>
One of my collegues in the UN retired <,,> uh and I was asking his
wife <,> how does she feels now <,> when the husband is in the home ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#130:1:B>
And she said <,,> that <quote> previousely <,> I had a full time
salary <,> and a part-time husband <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#131:1:B>
And now I have a part-time salary and full time husband <,>
which is <O> a few words </O> </quote> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#132:1:A>
Dr Gangarade <,> uh may we come to you for a movement now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#133:1:A>
<indig> Kai aise sawal hai aaj hamare sansar mei jahan yeh dekha
jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh <,,> purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai
wo jyada lamba hota hai </indig> they can they live longer than man <indig>
ab iska kya asar padhta hai samaj par </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#134:1:C>
<indig> Ek jo abhi jo Gokhale saheb ne kaha <,,> jo aap
</indig> economic <indig> sawal puchhe uspar mai kahna chahunga <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#135:1:C>
Dekhye jo </indig> young <indig> hota hai woh bhi karib karib
chaar </indig> decade <indig> tak jyada saal tak kam karta hai <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#136:1:C>
Nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne </indig> society <indig> ko
</indig> contribute <indig> kiya hai ab </indig> society <indig> ka ye jaroor
hota hai </indig> response <,,> the reciprocation <,> society must also
reciprocate him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#137:1:C>
<indig> Dekhye jo is wakht hamara jo khas sawal is prakar ka hai
<,> ke jab </indig> life expectency <indig> bad rahi hai to </indig> world
<O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#138:1:C>
It is not only the money which is important <,,> but what is
important is <,> the work or occupation is a therapy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#139:1:C>
Without the work <,> men feels lonely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#140:1:C>
Without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#141:1:C>
As Dr Gokhale was saying <,> I can give an example <,> as I said
again to repeat in my own study <,> I found a person who retired from the
government service <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#142:1:C>
By ten <w> O'clock </w> he would put his shoes <,> go in his
study-room <,> take all the files <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#143:1:C>
Whatever the files he had <,> and look everyday upto five <,,> <O>
laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#144:1:A>
He gets into a particular kind of routine

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#145:1:C>
Whole organization get disturbed <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#146:1:A>
Yeah

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#147:1:C>
So so one of his routinisation <,> like you said the wife
will have no problem <,> <O> laughter </O> <O> a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#148:1:A>
Dr Gokhale now this conference that is going on right at this
time <,> uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#149:1:A>
But then in the morning show we are different from the rest so <,>
we have just a couple of minutes left <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#150:1:A>
Now what are issues that you are discussing in this conference <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#151:1:B>
You see there are <,> uh major issues pertaining to aging
that are being discussed

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#152:1:B>
Such as <,,> disability and aging <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#153:1:B>
You see out of the total disable population in the world <,> sixty
percent people are elder <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#154:1:B>
So we would like to discuss that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#155:1:B>
We would like to discuss the issues regarding social security <,>
for the elderly population <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#156:1:B>
We would like to discuss indigenious health services such as
<indig> Ayurveda </indig> <,> Acupuncture <,> <indig> Unani </indig> system

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#157:1:B>
What can they do <,> for aging ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#158:1:B>
<w> That's </w> another subject we are going to discuss <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#159:1:B>
But more than that we are going to discuss the subject <,,> of the
rights and the responsibilities of elderly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#160:1:B>
A charter that was discussed <,,> at the economic and social
council of UN <,> which is being discussed in this informal sector <,> and
subsequently it will go to United Nations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#161:1:B>
That is a very important subject that we have to discuss <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#162:1:B>
And of course in addition to this there would be a number of <,>
subjects number of lectures etcetra

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#163:1:A>
And finally <,> Dr Gokhale <,,> uh the conference will <O>
one or two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#164:1:A>
What do you expect <,> to emerge at the end of the conference <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#165:1:B>
We are really <,> hoping <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#166:1:B>
Number one <,> that the whole emphasis will change <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#167:1:B>
You know presently people <,> tend to think <,> that aging is a
problem <,,> or its a subject of charity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#168:1:B>
We want to change it <,> to make that aging <,> an elderly <,>
they must be ready <}> <-> participated </-> <+> to participate </+> </}> <,>
they must be productive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#169:1:B>
So the change of emphasis <w> that's </w> what we <,> we want <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#170:1:B>
Secondly what we want <,> is an acceptance of the charter of the
rights of the elderly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#171:1:B>
And thirdly what we want <,> is to prepare a kind of a blue print
of action <,,> at the national level <,> where we need not uproot the people
from their family <,> but make them live in their families and be productive
<,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#172:1:C>
Well I would just like to add here

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#173:1:A>
Sir

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#174:1:C>
Most important point the conference will arrive at it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#175:1:C>
The care of the elderly is in the home that is in his own family
<,> and in his own community <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#176:1:C>
And unless the community and the family participates in the care
of the old <,> whether he is a disabled <,> or not <,> it will be very
difficult for any other agencies to take care of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#177:1:C>
I would also like to quote here <,> that Robert Browning has very
beautifully said <,> <quote> Grow old along with me <,> the best thing yet to
be </quote>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-035#178:1:A>
Wonderfull <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#179:1:A>
Dr Gokhale <,> Dr Gangarade thank you very much for being with us
in our studios and as you have heard that this vital issue of aging is going
to be discussed at this conference

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#180:1:A>
There will be greater international awareness after it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#181:1:A>
And there is also hope for people like me in a couple of hundred
years when <w> I'm </w> retired <,> <w> it's </w> possible that <w> I'll </w>
not be considered as burden or a problem

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#182:1:A>
But <,> uh still a productive force

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#183:1:A>
Well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us

<ICE-IND:S1B-035#184:1:A>
Thank you <,,> </I>
