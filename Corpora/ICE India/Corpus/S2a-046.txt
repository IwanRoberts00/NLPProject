<ICE-IND:S2A-046#1:1:A>
So in this my <,,> last talk <,,> in in this uh <,> Refresher
Course <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#2:1:A>
Uh uh I can't do <,,> uh <,,> in fact I want to give two talks on
commonwealth literature as such <,> but uh <,,> <O> cough </O> <w> you'll
</w> have to be satisfied <,> with only one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#3:1:A>
And again in the <,,> in the department here there are people <,> I
mean who are <,,> specialists in Common <,> wealth literature and probably
<,,> uh <,,> they will <,,> say something more <,,> uh concrete <,> about uh
<,,> Australian literature <,,> uh <,> African literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#4:1:A>
Now <,> <O> cough </O> uh <,,> now uh <,> Commonwealth Literature
<,,> when it was conceived I think sometime in <,,> the nineteen sixties <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#5:1:A>
Now I have <,> one date here <,> seventeen September nineteen
sixty-five <,,> uh on which <,> an association of Commonwealth <,,>
literature and language studies <,,> was <,,> formed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#6:1:A>
And <,> so <w> that's </w> a <,,> a good date <,> nineteenth
sixty-five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#7:1:A>
But the very term Commonwealth itself <,> the term Commonwealth <,>
is uh <,> quite an old one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#8:1:A>
In the seventeenth century <,,> the seventeenth century <,,> uh <,,>
uh the Act of uh British parliament established <,,> a Commonwealth company
<,,> uh <,,> a a comprising <,> English <,,> England and all the other <,,>
uh I don't <,> can't read in this <,> or the other territories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#9:1:A>
You see they called it a Commonwealth <,,> comprising England and
all the other <,,> uh dominions and territories <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#10:1:A>
It it <w> it's </w> a seventeenth <,> uh century <,> uh <,,> idea
<,,> and uh the <.> Ac </.> by the Act of parliament <,> this Commonwealth
was established <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#11:1:A>
And uh <,> then in the eighteenth century <,,> Berk <,,> the great
orator <,,> political orator <,,> now he <,,> speaks of the Commonwealth of
<,> nations <,,> Commonwealth of self governing nations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#12:1:A>
Then in the <,,> uh nineteenth century <,,> I mean the <,,> some of
the colonies <,> like Canada and uh <,,> New Zealand <,,> and Australia <,>
and <,> <}> <-> <.> So </.> </-> <=> South </=> </}> Africa <,> I mean they
<,,> uh became in a sense self governing <,> nations of course under <,> the
<,,> uh uh rule <,> or reign of <,,> uh the <,> the British King <,> or the
Queen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#13:1:A>
Now <w> it's </w> in uh <,> twentieth century <,,> that uh <,,> uh
now <,,> <}> <-> <.> En </.> </-> <=> England </=> </}> of course <,> was a
great imperial power <,> with a <,,> power over quite a number of colonies
<,,> and uh <,> to begin with <,,> uh it is a very comfortable imperial power
<,> enjoying its uh <,> rule over so many <,> uh colonies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#14:1:A>
And uh <,> the <,> and the English people were very proud <,,> uh
about the fact <,,> that uh the sun never set on the British Empire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#15:1:A>
But uh <,,> uh <,,> in in twentieth century in the first <,,> two
decades or so <,> I mean in all the colonies <,,> there was an awakening <,,>
and uh <,> and the struggle for freedom <,> uh started <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#16:1:A>
And then <,,> it is <,> as a result of the second world war <,,>
and also as a result of uh <,> the the uh <,,> strong freedom <,> movements
<,> in the colonies <,> most of the colonies became free <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#17:1:A>
So actually India <,> and Pakistan were the first <,> to become
free in nineteen forty-seven <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#18:1:A>
Then in uh fifty-seven Ghana and <,> Malaysia <,,> in nineteen
sixty Nigeria <,,> uh sixty-two <,> Yuganda <,,> sixty-seven uh <,,> <}> <->
<.> Da </.> </-> <=> Dangarika </=> </}> <,,> and Cyprus <,,> and sixty-six
Malta Zambia <,,> sixty-five Congo and like that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#19:1:A>
You see so <,> <w> it's </w> in the <,> forty late forties <,> and
fifties and sixties <,> I mean the most of the colonies became free <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#20:1:A>
And uh <,,> so for some reason <,,> because I think the the British
government was uh <,,> uh quite <,> <}> <-> <.> ap </.> </-> <=> apparently
</=> </}> <,,> showed a kind of a generosity <,> towards the colonies in
giving them freedom <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#21:1:A>
Uh <,,> though <,> the the <,,> then freedom struggle <,> were were
become had become really <,> ripe <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#22:1:A>
So it was a kind of both both give and take <,,> you see <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#23:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why <,> the the England had very cordial
relationships <,> with the colonies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#24:1:A>
And because of uh this cordiality <,> the the Commonwealth was born
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#25:1:A>
And uh Jawaharlal Nehru as I told you is one of the great uh <,>
advocates of the Commonwealth of uh <,,> the <,> British colonies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#26:1:A>
And uh <,,> now <,,> it is at that time again <,> the concept of
Commonwealth literature came into <,> existence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#27:1:A>
So I gave you the date as about <,> early <,,> early <,> sixties
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#28:1:A>
Now <,> uh <,,> what are the factors <,> that uh <,> brought <,>
all these literatures together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#29:1:A>
Now one of course is <,> the English language <,> and the other is
the the common <,> cultural relationship between the <,> between the colonies
and England <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#30:1:A>
And uh one might say <,> the colonial consciousness <,> and the
English language <,,> <-> have </-> were the two binding factors <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#31:1:A>
Now to begin with I mean uh <,,> those who sort of <,> the
Commonwealth literature <,,> uh were uh people from Leads University as I
told you yesterday <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#32:1:A>
Now professor Walsh was the first person to write <,,> a small book
on Commonwealth literature <,,> and in the introduction to this particular
book <,,> uh Walsh says speaks of <,> uh the <,> the central cannon of
British literature <,> and uh these other literatures <,> are uh <,,>
satellites of this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#33:1:A>
You see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central
<,> area of uh <,> British literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#34:1:A>
So <,> you you find <,> in that concept of uh <,,> the Commonwealth
literature a a kind of imperial attitude <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#35:1:A>
It still carries imperial attitude <,> and makes the British <,,>
uh literature as the central <,> cannon and the others its <,> satellite <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#36:1:A>
But uh the <,,> the <.> ca </.> the writers in the colonies of
course <,> they reacted very strongly against this imperial <,> concept <,,>
of uh Commonwealth literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#37:1:A>
Now <,,> uh <,> what are the literatures that came together <,,> uh
<,,> the Australian literature <,,> uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-046#38:1:B>
Canadian

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-046#39:1:A>
And then uh New Zealand <,,> then African <,,> then Carribean
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#40:1:A>
Now in Canada <,,> a <,> uh there are about two languages one is uh
French and the other English <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#41:1:A>
So half of uh <,> Canada <,> and uh <,> Africa <,> <O> one word
</O> Muslims uh <,,> newly educated people wrote in English <,> so the entire
African literature <,> <.> a </.> and also for some <,,> uh <,,> pople from
uh <,,> what country is it <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#42:1:A>
Lagose <,,> you see they wrote in uh <,> French <,> but they <,>
whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#43:1:A>
And then uh <,,> as far as India is concerned as I mentioned this
morning <,> only one tenth of <,> our literature <,> was represented

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#44:1:A>
Only that literature which was written <,> in English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#45:1:A>
So if you look at these Commonwealth countries <,,> we find there
are <,,> white Commonwealth countries and coloured Commonwealth countries
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#46:1:A>
There is Australia <,> Canada <,> New Zealand <,,> in fact they
<,,> they <,> they still follow the European tradition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#47:1:A>
After all <,,> uh the Australians and the Canadians and the the New
Zealand people <,> they are <,,> Englishmen who went and settle there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#48:1:A>
And the relationship between <,,> the cultural relationship between
England and the other <,> these uh <,> white Commonwealth countries that of
one might say <,> father and son <,,> father and son <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#49:1:A>
And uhm <,,> now the problem was they wanted to seek their own
identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#50:1:A>
They wanted to become Australians or Canadians and New Zealanders
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#51:1:A>
So that problem <,> was there with them <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#52:1:A>
Even though <,,> the the son <,> as he grows up <,> he would like
to be <,> separate <,> he would like to have a separate identity <,> from the
parents <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#53:1:A>
You see it it is that kind of uh <,,> development that you find in
uh <,,> the literatures of the <,> white uh <,,> commonwealth countries <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#54:1:A>
But if you take the coloured countries <,,> what are the coloured
countries ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#55:1:A>
India <,,> uh and Africa and <,> West Indies <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#56:1:A>
Now <,,> uh <,,> India <,,> for one reason or <}> <-> <.> an </.>
</-> <=> another </=> </}> <,,> I mean it didn't develop a <,> a kind of
protest <,> that Africans <,> <-> Africas </-> developed towards <,,> English
<,> uh <.> Eng </.> uh England <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#57:1:A>
Now uh <,,> even though my even looking at the Indian <w> let's
</w> take I mean uh <,> each <,,> uh <,,> each literature <,> I mean uh
Australian literature Canadian literature <,> or Indian writing in English
<,> or African literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#58:1:A>
Now <,,> even before they came together <,,> under one umbrella of
uh <,> Commonwealth literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#59:1:A>
Now each <,> literature had developed to a certain extent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#60:1:A>
Now <,,> uh one can say that each <,> literature <,> <}> <-> have
</-> <+> has </+> </}> passed through <,> <}> <-> <.> nea </.> </-> <=>
nearly </=> </}> four phases <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#61:1:A>
And actually it is in the <,> third phase of its development <,,>
that uh <,> these literatures came together under one <,,> uh umbrella <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#62:1:A>
Now this is the first stage <,,> I mean that is during your <,> the
<,> the period of imperialism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#63:1:A>
You see the the <,> there there was this writing <,> writing in <,>
in that writing you find <,> that uh <,,> the British culture was the
dominant culture <,,> and uh the the the culture of the colonies <,> was the
subordinate culture <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#64:1:A>
And uh <,> the the colonies in a sense <,,> for one reason or
another yielded to the British <,> dominant culture <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#65:1:A>
Uh but this yielding is not uh I mean a very simple kind of an
yielding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#66:1:A>
In the case of Australian literature or Canadian <,> you find this
there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were <,,> uh more or
less <,> the British <,> who had just gone away from uh <,,> England and they
were staying there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#67:1:A>
So before they started talking in terms of their own identity in
the beginning <,> they did enjoy this yielding <,,> or continuing the old
tradition of the British <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#68:1:A>
Uh <,,> but <,,> later on <,> the second phase <,,> the second
phase is a very important phase

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#69:1:A>
The second phase <,> is a love-hate relationship <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#70:1:A>
Now in India this love-hate relationship <,> begins <,,> uh in the
<,,> uh early twentieth century <,,> with uh <,> uh <,,> the Gandhian period
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#71:1:A>
During the Gandhian era <,> one might say <,> this uh tension <,,>
uh was at the highest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#72:1:A>
And the <w> that's </w> the reason why <,> we have great writers
during this period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#73:1:A>
Any period of tension <,,> or any period in which there is this
love-hate relationship <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#74:1:A>
So uh <,> that period is <,> very fertile <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#75:1:A>
We have very great writers <,,> uh not only they did write in
English but also in the other <,> uh Indian literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#76:1:A>
I mean uh <,,> who expressed themselves during this period <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#77:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why from one point of view <,> that was a
period of Renaissance for us <,> in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#78:1:A>
Even though we accepted <,,> uh a good deal from the British
influence <,> from from England <,,> uh we took them forms <,,> the the
European forms <,,> the novel <,> the short story <,> the one act play and
<,> uh three act play and all those things <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#79:1:A>
But uh still <,,> uh they tried to express <,,> the Indian
experience in a very <,> intense way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#80:1:A>
And uh <,> during the third phase <,> the third phase is <,> the
phase <,> that comes immediately after <,> getting political <,,> liberation
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#81:1:A>
Uh that is <,> political decolonisation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#82:1:A>
Immediately <.> af </.> <,> that is followed by a third phase <,>
and when I mean there is an attempt <,,> to <,,> I uh seek <,> ones own
identity <,> uh and uh <,,> to seek <,,> ones own <,> national spirit <,,>
and <w> that's </w> how a very interesting <,> stage of development <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#83:1:A>
Now it is <-> a </- > during this stage the third stage of <,> the
development of uh colonial consciousness <,> that uh <,> we find this coming
together <,> of uh <,,> uh the literatures of all these colonies <,,> under
the umbrella of <,,> uh Commonwealth <,> literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#84:1:A>
Now <,> the fourth phase comes after that <,,> say is is now <,>
that uh <,> the most of these literature <,> are in the fourth phase <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#85:1:A>
And the fourth phase is <,> the phase of confidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#86:1:A>
You see <,> now most of these literatures they have attained <,> in
a sense <,> their own identify <,> and they have produced their own uh <,,>
great writers <,,> and uh <,> now actually each literature <,,> I mean can
stand on its own legs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#87:1:A>
Uh <,,> so I have a feeling <,> that the Commonwealth literature
<,> I mean in third phase they came together <,> and there were there were
number of similar problems that uh <,> uh they were facing <,> probably the
<.> pha </.> the problem of uh <,,> seeking ones own identity <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#88:1:A>
And uh <,> almost all these literatures went back to their past <,>
their folklores <,> in order to <,> derive inspiration <,> uh uh <,> and uh
<,> uh in one way or other

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#89:1:A>
In fact there are various ways not one way in which <,> they found
their own identity <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#90:1:A>
But uh <,> they found <,> there there there they went in for
various strategies <,,> uh in order to <,> uh seek their own identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#91:1:A>
And once having found their own identity <,,> now they they <,,>
they are very confident now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#92:1:A>
They are confident <,> and <-> the </-> each <,> has developed its
own literature <,,> that is <,> they now <,> a a big body of Canadian
literature <,> a very large body of Australian literature <,> and very large
body of uh <,,> Carribean literature <,,> and also African literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#93:1:A>
And uh <,> now the Africans have become so conscious <,> that they
don't want to write in English any longer <,,> and uh <,> <w> they've </w>
have started writing <,> in their own languages <,,> their own tribal
languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#94:1:A>
Now uh <,,> uh <,,> <w> I've </w> a feel I I have a hunch <,,> that
uh <,,> gradually this <,> uh Commonwealth <,> the concept of Commonwealth
literature will <,> uh disintegrate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#95:1:A>
Because <,> the need will go away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#96:1:A>
There was a need for sometime <,,> you see united we stand that
kind of attitude was there <,> and uh <,> <.> no </.> then we did a lot of uh
<,> I mean uh comparative work <,> and uh number of conferences meeting
together

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#97:1:A>
But now we find that uh <,,> each literature has come of age and it
doesn't require the help of the others <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#98:1:A>
And uh <,,> <}> <-> they they </-> <=> there </=> </}> are more
differences than common points now <,> in the fourth phase <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#99:1:A>
So <,> I have a feeling that uh <,> now there will be
disintegration <,> of uh <,> Commonwealth literature <,> and uh each
literature will start just as American literature became totally independent
<,> of uh <,> uh British literature in the nineteenth century <,> and
established its own identity and now they talk only of American literature
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#100:1:A>
Similarly Australians have brought forth I mean big <,,> uh uh
histories of Australian literature <,> and now <,,> they don't need <,> the
help of <,> the the umbrella <,> you see Commonwealth literature

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#101:1:A>
They have <,> achieved their identity <,> they have their great
writers like uh <,> uh Patrick White who won the Nobel prize <,> the great
novelist <,> and then they have very important <,> poets like <,,> Cannis
Leaser or A D Hope or Judith Wright <,> and again they have <,> uh <w>
they're </w> quite happy with uh <,> their Australianess <,> in uh <w>
they've </w> achieved it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#102:1:A>
And <-> the </-> they have well defined <,> they have defined
their Australianess <,> and uh <,,> <w> they're </w> happy with their
development <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#103:1:A>
And similar is the case with the Africans <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#104:1:A>
Now Africans during this third phase they did produce <,> some
great writers like uh <?> Chinua Achibee </?> <,> then Ole Soynka <,> then
Ngugi <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#105:1:A>
Now Ole Soynka well he got Nobel prize <,> and Chinua Achibee is
all he also became a world figure <,> by his first novel itself <,> the
things fall apart <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#106:1:A>
And <,> so they have achieved their own identity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#107:1:A>
And now again their breaking up in the sense <,> now Ngugi say I
will no longer write in English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#108:1:A>
He will write in his uh <,> Kenyan <,,> <w> it's </w> not Swahili
but some other <,,> uh uh language <,,> it is a different name and he wants
to write in that language first <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#109:1:A>
And then translate from that <,,> into English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#110:1:A>
Uh <,,> now uh <,> so they are all very now very self conscious
about <,> their Africanness or Australianess or Canadianess <,> and uh now
<w> they're </w> very few points which are common <,> amongst all these <,>
Commonwealth literatures <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#111:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> why <,> <w> I've </w> a feeling that <,> uh
they will separate <,,> and Indian writing in English <,,> will become part
of Indian Literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#112:1:A>
You see instead of <,> uh uh aligning itself with Commonwealth
literatures <,> uh it will seek its identity <,,> with uh other <,> Indian
literatures in other <,> in native languages <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#113:1:A>
And uh <,> this is in general <,> uh what would happen and
probably <w> what's </w> going to happen <,> with uh Commonwealth <,>
literature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#114:1:A>
Now uh <,,> the the main problem with <,> uh this Commonwealth
literature was the <,> was the <,,> attempt to seek ones identity <,> and
this is a very interesting phase <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#115:1:A>
And Africans have <}> <-> went </-> <+> gone </+> </}> back to
their <,> ancient uh <,,> Gods and rituals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#116:1:A>
And uh <,,> uh <,,> the way they went back <,> in fact uh <,> is a
is a <,> is a lesson to us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-046#117:1:A>
And I would like to read for example <,> some of the things <,,>
the way for example <,,> they went back to their gods <,,> </I>
