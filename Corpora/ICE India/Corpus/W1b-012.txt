Dear Dr. Kamath, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#4:1>
I just received a copy of your letter sent to Dr.
Dhawan with  
regard to your experiences last year in publishing the
proceedings of the  
Conference. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#5:1>
I have also received a letter from Suman Bala with
copies of your  
correspondence with USEFI on the sale of copies of the
published text. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#6:1>
I hope you have received my earlier letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#7:1>
I have not yet had any reply from you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#8:1>
Nor have I received the <ul> list of members,
membership forms,  
receipt books </ul> and <ul> rubber stamp </ul> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#9:1>
I would request you to expedite sending these to me so
that I can  
start doing what little I can for the Association </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#10:1>
Could you kindly let me know what exactly was the
understanding  
with USEFI about the purchase of our published proceedings? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#11:1>
Had they indeed agreed to buy <O> letterhead repeated
</O> 100 copies  
each of <ul> both </ul> the books? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#12:1>
I can not write to Dr. Lavakare unless I know for sure
what your  
understanding was. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#13:1>
About the themes for the next Conference I have
had no  
suggestions so far. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#14:1>
In your subject at least could you kindly consult with
Dr. Babar and  
let me have some topics of interest. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#15:1>
I hope your health is fine. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#16:1>
Is there any chance of your coming over to Calcutta? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#17:1>
If I come to Bombay I will see you. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#18:1>

Dear Prof. Kamath, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#25:1>
I hope you have reached Bombay safe and sound
after that hectic  
Conference. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#26:1>
I also hope that your train was not late and you
reached as planned.  
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#27:1>
I can imagine how busy you have been these past
two years. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#28:1>
You have indeed worked tirelessly and I only wish I
can do at least  
half of what you did. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#29:1>
Now to get on with the work inherited from you I
need a few  
things from you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#30:1>
I need the emblem to print the letter heads, I need
the list of  
members to write to and above all I need the full names and
addresses of the  
current executive members. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#31:1>
I had no chance to meet these people in person and so
I do not know  
their initials, place of work etc. </p> <O> leterhead along

I will certainly see you when I come to Bombay next. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#36:1>
How do you keep in touch with the executive? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#37:1>
Is there any meeting before the conference? </p>

Now the summer must be over in Bombay and the usual

Perhaps, you must have heard from Mohite that both
of us were  
invited to attend the Salzburg Seminar on American Studies. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#46:1>
It was a very illuminating experience. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#47:1>
May be you have also attended it in your time. </p>

I have told Mohite to give me a report on Lucknow

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#50:1>
But I will need your help most of all to get ( 1) a
short version of  
the constitution, ( 2) some write up on on Olive Reddick and
Dr Gilmore and (  
3) any other matter you may like to include.

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#53:1>
I have what you sent and a few others. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#54:1>
Suman Bala has not given me anything yet in spite my
meeting her  
personally at Delhi. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#55:1>
I have also not got her report. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#56:1>
Have you got a copy of whatever she submitted at
Lucknow? </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#57:1>
About the one-day-seminar - - I have written to
ASRC requesting  
for the venue and also approached ICSSR for financial support.


<ICE-IND:W1B-012#58:1>
Could you advise me how to go about so that we may
<del> have </del>  
hold the Seminar in October. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#59:1>
About the venue Pondicherry seems to be okay but
now Dr. Jha  
writes that <del> sh </del> he is very ill. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#60:1>
He has suggested another person in the University who
has offered to  
Organise at Pondicherry. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#61:1>
Please do write and advise, so that we can make

Dear Prof. Kamath, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#65:1>
I have been writing quite a few letters to a
number of our people  
but I don't get any replies. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#66:1>
This must be a situation you are also familiar with
and hence I write  
to you to seek solace. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#67:1>
We are planning a Seminar here in Calcutta on the
30th Sep and  
1st Oct. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#68:1>
This is the mid year seminar you have got going in
your time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#69:1>
I have applied to ICSSR for funds. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#70:1>
I am also trying for funds from other sources,
although I am not yet  
sure. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#71:1>
Could you tell me how to be sure of ICSSR funds? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#72:1>
The subject of the seminar is Interactions : India and
the U.S. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#73:1>
The seminar will have four sessions, historical,
socio-economic, political and cultural. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#74:1>
I invite you to come and attend the seminar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#75:1>
I hope you can come and participate. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#76:1>
I wrote to Dr. Babar also about this Seminar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#77:1>
I had requested him to give me a short write up on the
history and  
activities of IAAS. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#78:1>
I don't know whether he is in town or not. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#79:1>
If not, could you kindly write it for me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#80:1>
This is for inclusion in a proposed souvenir. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#81:1>
I have sent all the matter to be printed in the
newsletter to  
Mohite since he was willing to do it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#82:1>
I am waiting for him to complete the work. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#83:1>
I have not received the accounts from Suman in
spite of writing  
several times. </p>

I sent him a copy of all materials to be included,

I got Dr. <w> Babu's </w> letter but not the
papers to give me an

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#98:1>
What I am not yet sure of is the name it had when it
was formed, how  
the name got changed, its indebtedness, if any, to American
funds, the status  
of its American members etc. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#99:1>
Are any american members working on Indian Studies? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#100:1>
What is the status of the American Institute of
Indian Studies  
corresponding to our IAAS. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#101:1>
Please clarify after consulting with Dr. Babu. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#102:1>

As regards travel expenses, I would like to arrange
for at least  
First class fare to active participants, but I can be sure
only after seeing  
the response to ad booking. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#107:1>
But accommodation and local hospitality is assured. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#108:1>
Do you think that Dr. Babar will agree to come on
anything less than  
airfare. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#109:1>
I want him to come, but I can not think of airfares
at this stage. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#110:1>
Is there any other source that can support or
subsidize his travel? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#111:1>
Can you raise this question and get his views for me?
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#112:1>
I am sorry that Suman has not yet honored your
bills.

I hope you got the executive circular and I have
some hopes that  
you can help us raise some funds for the conference. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#166:1>
Last time you had almost promised me. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#167:1>
I hope your invitation is in order. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#168:1>
I still don't have an exact idea of our program. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#169:1>
I am going to Pondicherry tomorrow to oversee the
arrangements. </p>

Wishing you the very best in 1995. <&> complimentary

Dear Prof. Kamath, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#174:1>
I hope you received my previous letter along with
a copy of the book. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#175:1>
I now understand from Dr. Dhawan that he has also
sent you a book. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-012#176:1>
Since you do not need more than one copy of a
book in literature  
could you kindly pass on the extra copy to Dr. Mutalik Desai? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#177:1>
He is entitled to a copy as a contributor and we
might as well give  
it to him now not waiting for any formalities </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-012#178:1>
Thanking you and awaiting your reply.
