<ICE-IND:W2B-022#5:1>
Nuclear war, natural disasters, attack from extra-terrestrial
beings - - all these have been the subjects of science fiction stories.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#6:1>
To this list can now be added one more possibility: an asteroid
impact.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#7:1>
The butt of ridicule only a few years ago, the potential of an
asteroid to cause large-scale destruction is now being increasingly realized
by both the scientific community and the public.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#8:1>
A study conducted in 1980 showed strong evidence that an asteroid
impact wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#9:1>
The pictures beamed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 on its encounters
with the outer planets and their satellites established that many planetary
bodies in the solar system were subjected to repeated asteroid impacts, and
some even broke up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#10:1>
Evidence of asteroids colliding with the Earth has been piling
up, ever since a US mining engineer, Daniel Barringer, suggested in 1906 that
the crater in the Arizona desert was caused by a meteorite impact.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#11:1>
Nearly 50 years later, the US planetary geologist Eugene
Schoemaker proved that the crater had been made nearly 50,000 years ago by
the impact of a meteor about 150 m long.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#12:1>
Since then, nearly 200 impact craters have been discovered in several
countries including India, Brazil and Ghana. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#13:1>
The Lonar crater in Buldana district of Maharashtra was also made
by a <O> photograph </O> <O> <&> author's name </&> J. J. RAWAL </O> <O>
tantalizer 1 </O> meteor impact nearly 50,000 years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#14:1>
The most recent asteroidal impact occurred in 1908 near the
Tunguska river in Siberia.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#15:1>
The collision, which was heard 800 km away, destroyed a large area
of the forest around and set the night sky of Europe aglow for days.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#16:1>
Cratering is a dominant geological process in the solar system,
although it is a rare event in human experience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#17:1>
From where do asteroids and meteors originate? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#18:1>
On January 1, 1801, a Sicilian astronomer Guiseppe Piazzi
spotted a small body in the huge vacant space between Mars and Jupiter,
about 2.8 astronomical units ( AU) from the Earth ( one AU is the distance
between the Earth and the Sun).

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#19:1>
He named it after the Sicilian goddess Ceres.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#20:1>
A year later, the German astronomer Heinrich Olbers spotted another
tiny body at the same location, and named it Pallas.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#21:1>
In the next few years two more such bodies, Juno and Vesta, were
discovered.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#22:1>
The famous 18th century British astronomer Sir William Herschel
called these bodies asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#23:1>
<it> Asteroid </it> in Greek means star-like; seen through the
largest 19th century telescopes, asteroids appeared as mere points of light.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#24:1>
The discovery of Ceres and the other asteroids puzzled
astronomers, as they had expected to find a planet in the gap between Mars
and Jupiter, as suggested by <w> Bode's </w> formula.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#25:1>
In the early 1770s, Johann Bode, director of the Berlin Observatory,
came across a rule for planetary orbits formulated by the German
mathematician Johann Titius in 1766.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#26:1>
Titius had stated that if the distance between the Sun and Saturn is
taken to be 100 units, then <O> <&> page </&> 18 </O> Mercury is 4 units away
from the Sun, Venus is 7 units distant, the Earth, Mars and Jupiter are 10,
15 and 52 units away.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#27:1>
( Saturn was the furthest planet then known. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#28:1>
Titius found a vacant gap between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of
28 units from the Sun.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#29:1>
Bode was so impressed with <w> Titius's </w> formula that he
publicized it, without, however, giving any credit to its originator, and
the rule came to be known as <w> Bode's </w> formula of planetary
distances. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#30:1>
When Bode extended the formula, he found that it did, indeed,
give the distance of Uranus, discovered in 1781.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#31:1>
The absence of a planet, and the discovery of some more asteroids, at
28 units, gave Olbers the idea that the latter were the remnants of a planet
that had somehow broken up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#32:1>
However, Olbers had no clue as to how the planet had
disintegrated, and the mystery remained unsolved. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#33:1>
<w> Olbers's </w> broken-planet theory, although unsubstantiated,
was used nearly 150 years later by the Dutch astronomer J.H. Oort to explain
his own hypothesis of the distribution of long-period comets, which have
periods of thousands of years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#34:1>
In 1950, after studying 19 long-period comets, Oort concluded that
these bodies actually came from a huge cloud of comets about 100,000 AU
from the Sun, circumscribing <O> sketch </O> <O> caption </O> <O> map, spread over
two columns </O> the solar system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#35:1>
Stellar perturbations threw some of these comets inwards where they
were captured by the gravitational attraction of the Sun and the giant
planets and became members of the solar family.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#36:1>
In order to explain how the comets first gathered to a form a cloud,
Oort drew on <w> Olbers's </w> idea that a planet that had existed between
Mars and Jupiter somehow broke up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#37:1>
As it exploded, he hypothesized, the more energetic fragments were
flung far out and formed the Oort cloud of comets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#38:1>
However, the actual physical mechanism which caused the planet to
explode, and the composition of the fragments which had undergone such a
violent upheaval still remained unknown. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#39:1>
At this point, it is essential to establish the correlation
between comets, asteroids and meteorites.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#40:1>
Scientists believe that asteroids are simple dead comets and that
meteor showers are from the left-over of comets in their orbits.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#41:1>
Thus asteroids are simple more evolved comets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#42:1>
There is also some evidence that comets, asteroids and meteorites
belong to the same family of bodies in the solar system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#43:1>
Many comets show distinct asteroidal properties, and there are
asteroids which display cometary characteristics. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#44:1>
There are several theories about the distribution and origin of
comets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#45:1>
In the 1960s, the US planetary scientist Gerard Kuiper hypothesized
that there may be a belt of comets just outside the orbit of Pluto.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#46:1>
To explain the origin of the Kuiper belt, Fred Whipple of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Centre, USA, also known to his colleagues as the
comet Pope, suggested that when Uranus and Neptune were formed, they threw
out the remaining planetesimals <O> photograph </O> <O> <&> below the photograph,
editorial comment at the end of the article </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 19
</O> just outside the orbit of Pluto.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#47:1>
Although there are problems with this theory as well, astronomers
believe that the Kuiper belt of comets does exist and that it is just the
beginning of the larger Oort cloud. </p>

<p> Then there are the short-period comets in the solar system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#48:1>
According to astronomers, these were longperiod comets which were
gravitationally captured when they entered the solar system and
threreafter became short-period comets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#49:1>
This theory, however, accounts for only a small fraction of the
number of such comets observed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#50:1>
Comets which have an extremely short period, from 2 to 10 years,
are called families of asteroids associated with the inner planets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#51:1>
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#52:1>
These include planet-crossing asteroids, nearSun and near-Earth
asteroids. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#53:1>
Near-Earth asteroids move about near the <w> Earth's </w> orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#54:1>
Apollo and Amor asteroids belong to this category.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#55:1>
The Apollo-type asteroids are small objects that move about in the
vicinity of the <w> Earth's </w> orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#56:1>
Amor asteroids are found between the orbits of the Earth and Mars.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#57:1>
Apollo and Amor bodies often cross the <w> Earth's </w> orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#58:1>
Aten asteroids orbit the Sun and stay very close to it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#59:1>
Toro asteroids vacillate between the orbits of the Earth and Venus.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#60:1>
Asteroids are also classified according <O> four photographs at the
bginning of column 2 & 3 </O> <O> caption in the middle </O> to their
composition.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#61:1>
Some are giant C-type carbonaceous chondrites - - stony bodies
containing small mineral granules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#62:1>
Some others, called S-type asteroids, are made of silicates rich in
iron and magnesium; their spectral lines show a reddish tinge, probably due
to the presence of a pure nickel-iron alloy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#63:1>
A third type of asteroids, which are coated with ice, also have a
reddish tinge, but they show no evidence of other minerals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#64:1>
S-type bodies are distributed in the inner region of the main
asteroid belt, towards the Sun.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#65:1>
C-type asteroids inhabit the middle portion of the belt, and the
icecoated asteroids are found at the outer fringes of the belt, close to
Jupiter. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#66:1>
<h> <bold> Chances of a hit </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#67:1>
Near-Earth asteroids are not the only ones which can strike the
Earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#68:1>
However, by virtue of being near the <w> Earth's </w> orbit, they
have potential to hit when in a particular configuration, subject to the
gravitational field and resonance of the Sun and other planets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#69:1>
The asteroids that collide with the Earth, or any other planet or
satellite, may be from the main asteroid <O> <&> page </&> 20 </O> belt,
or from the Trojan clouds at the Lagrangian points associated with planetary
orbits ( see box on p.20) or even from the Oort cloud. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#70:1>
The result of an asteroid impact depends on the velocity,
projectile mass, angle of impact and the surface material strength of the
projectile and the target.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#71:1>
The Barringer crater, mentioned earlier, which was made by a 150-m
long asteroid, has a diameter of 1,200 m and is 180 m deep, with a 45-m high
earth-collar rising around it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#72:1>
The Lonar crater is a depression 1,830 m across and 150 m deep.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#73:1>
An asteroid 1-2 km long would have a catastrophic impact.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#74:1>
The collision of a body about 10 km across will bring about mass
extinction of life on our planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#75:1>
The impact would throw millions of tons of sand, soil and dust
into the atmosphere blocking out sunlight, and choke out life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#76:1>
What are the chances of an asteroid striking the Earth in our
life - - time?

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#77:1>
Statistically speaking, an asteroid 50 m across strikes every 100-200
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#78:1>
A slightly bigger one of about 150 m comes down once in 50,000 to
100,000 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#79:1>
A really big one, about 2-3 km across, can be expected once in
250,000 years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#80:1>
However, the possibility of an actual collision is not as
far-fetched as the figures seem to indicate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#81:1>
In 1989, a nearly one-km-long missile crossed the <w> Earth's </w>
orbit at a point where the planet had been a mere six hours earlier, a
whisker in astronomical terms.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#82:1>
Had it struck, the energy released would have been equivalent to
1,000 one-megaton bombs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#83:1>
In January 1991, another asteroid passed within 160,000 km of the
Earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#84:1>
In 1937, the asteroid Hermes missed the Earth by less than twice the
distance to the Moon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#85:1>
With growing evidence of the possibility of an asteroid
collision, as well as the detection of more Earth-crossing asteroids,
greater effort is being made to track these bodies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#86:1>
Astronomers Tom Gehrels and Jim Scotti at the Kit Peak National
Observatory, USA, are scouring the skies with a 36-inch reflecting
telescope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#87:1>
An estimated 2,000 Earth-crossing asteroids are believed to be
moving dangerously close to our planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#88:1>
Gehrels says that four 36-inch telescopes spread around the globe
would be able to track down nearly 90 per cent of these within the next 10
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#89:1>
The Anglo-Australian near-Earth asteroid survey was instituted in
Australia in May 1990 to open up a vista from the southern hemisphere.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#90:1>
A number of near-Earth asteroids have been discovered under this
project. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#91:1>
If one is seen coming perilously close to the Earth, there are
two possible ways of avoiding a collision.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#92:1>
One is to launch a missile that will break up the asteroid in
mid-air.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#93:1>
Such a course would, however, rain debris on the Earth, causing
considerable damage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#94:1>
A more feasible solution is to launch a rocket which will divert the
course of the incoming projectile. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#95:1>
There is another, equally important, reason to observe and study
asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#96:1>
Scientists believe that main-belt asteroids are primordial material
that failed to accrete and form a planet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#97:1>
The material in comets, asteroids and meteorites are the basic
building blocks of <O> sketch </O> <O> photograph </O> <O> caption </O> all
bodies in the solar system; thus studying them can give invaluable clues to
the formation of the planetary system and the conditions that prevailed at
its inception.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#98:1>
Any good theory of the formation of the solar system must
satisfactorily explain the origin, evolution and structure of comets,
asteroids and meteorites, their families and interrelationships. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#99:1>
Several projects have been designed for the study fo
asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#100:1>
Some well-known asteroids have been targeted for special study.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#101:1>
In October 1991, the spacecraft Galileo, launched by the <O>
photograph </O> <O> caption </O> US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration ( NASA ) , made the first ever flyby of an asteroid, when it
passed within, 1,600 km of Gaspra.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#102:1>
<w> Galileo's </w> sophisticated sensors - - a spectrometer,
radiometer and polarimeter - - investigated the asteroid which is about
the size of the Martian moon Diemos.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#103:1>
Gaspra showed up as having a cratered, irregular surface, with 20
per cent reflectivity and a rotational period of 7.04 hours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#104:1>
It is an S-type asteroid composed of pure metal and metal-rich
silicates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#105:1>
Galileo will also study another S-type asteroid, Ida, <it> en route
</it> to Jupiter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#106:1>
Preliminary plans are under way for dedicated missions to
near-Earth asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#107:1>
The Italian Space <w> Agency's </w> project is named Piazzi.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#108:1>
One of the prime targets of this project is the asteroid Eros.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#109:1>
With a diameter of nearly 20 km, Eros is the second largest
near-Earth asteroid so far discovered ( Ganymed is the largest, about 30
km across).

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#110:1>
This body frequently appears close to the Earth, enabling
astronomers to determine its orbital elements.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#111:1>
Therefore, astronomers already have some understanding of its
physical and geometric characteristics, especially its shape and
rotational axis, which should provide a useful background for an in-depth
study. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#112:1>
Cassini, <w> NASA's </w> space mission to Saturn, which is
expected to be launched in 1996, will also study asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#113:1>
The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico can image main-belt
asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#114:1>
The Hubble Space Telescope should also provide detailed images as
well as mineralogical information about asteroids.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#115:1>
Thus, we can hope to have a rich treasure trove of information in
time to celebrate the bicentennial of the discovery of the first asteroid - -

Asteroid collisions are also interwoven with mythology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#118:1>
This is the GangaBhogavati <indig> sangam </indig> , or Vishnu
Gaya, in Buldana.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#119:1>
The temple-like structure has been built around the hole, from which
water flows continuously.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#120:1>
Behind the hole is a hillock.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#121:1>
According to legend, Lord Vishnu killed the demon Lavanasura by
inserting his toe in the <w> latter's </w> navel and whirling him
round.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#122:1>
The goddess Ganga then emerged in the form of a spring to clean <w>

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#123:1>
Scientists believe that an asteroid striking the hillock generated
sufficient pressure to force out the stream of water. </p> </bold> </&>
<&> box incerted on page 20 column one and two </&> <box> <bold> THE
LAGRANGIAN POINTS </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#124:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> Joseph </smallcaps> </bold> Lagrange, (
1736-1813), a French mathematician, attempted to solve the problem of the net
gravitation of a system involving three bodies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#125:1>
In order to simplify his task, Lagrange set the condition that the
mass of the third body should be extremely small compared to those of the
other two.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#126:1>
Thus, the three bodies in the system could be the Sun, a planet and
a satellite or a comet.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#127:1>
( One cannot consider a system involving the Sun and two planets or
the Sun and two stars. )

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#128:1>
This is <w> Lagrange's </w> restricted three-body problem, for which
he found five solutions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#129:1>
These are points in space where the net gravitational force is zero
( see diagram).

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#130:1>
Of the five Lagrangian points, L<sb>4</sb> and L<sb>5</sb> are
stable, while the other three are unstable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#131:1>
Every planet in the solar system has associated Lagrangian
points.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#132:1>
The primordial matter of the solar system which gathered at these
points remained there undisturbed for millions of years, as they
experienced no gravitational force.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#133:1>
These are called Trojan bodies.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#134:1>
Nearly 1,000 Trojan asteroids have been discovered at <w> Jupiter's
</w> Lagrangian <O> <box> in sketch </box> </O>  points and many more
still are believed to be there.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#135:1>
Trojan bodies have also been found at the Lagrangian points of the
Earth and Mars, and <w> Saturn's </w> moons Dione and Tethys. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-022#136:1>
At a certain configuration of the Sun and planets, these
hitherto undisturbed bodies leak out of their Lagrangian locations and
become members of the solar system.

<ICE-IND:W2B-022#137:1>
Some of these may also rain down on the planets and their
satellites. </p> </box> <&> editorial comment at the end of clumn 3 page 19
