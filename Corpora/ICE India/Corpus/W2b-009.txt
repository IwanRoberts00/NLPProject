At a time when youth everywhere is tripping on MTV and Channel V,
what draws young people to western classical music?

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#3:1>
PRIMROSE MONTEIRO meets some youngsters in Bombay to find out </p>
</&> <&> begin from column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#4:1>
<w> <bold>H</bold>andel's </w> Messiah, like other compositions
of its ilk and stature, begins with an overture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#5:1>
In the darkened auditorium, the music makes a dramatic entry, setting
the tone for the work to follow, and moves decisively to a quicker tempo.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#6:1>
The <w> conductor's </w> hands flutter, the music thrills <*> dotted
line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#7:1>
And comes to silence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#8:1>
when the eyes accustom themselves to the reduced light, it is to
notice that the Bombay Chamber <w> Orchestra's </w> ( BCO ) membership of 55
is largely youth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#9:1>
Founded in 1962, primarily to offer young musical talent in Bombay an
incentive to continue their musical studies, it offers them also a chance to
play in concerts such as this one - - the rendering of <w> Handel's </w>
Messiah by the Paranjoti Academy Chorus and the Cathedral Chorus to raise
funds for Shanti Avedna Ashram at the NCPA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#10:1>
<w> That's </w> perhaps why, when the rest of young Bombay is
getting set for a Saturday night on the disco / pub tiles, the young
musicians of the BCO show their commitment to music in each swing of the bow,
each studied breath into their instruments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#11:1>
It is a commitment they have reiterated each time by attending
three-hour Sunday morning practices at Max Mueller Bhavan.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#12:1>
Each time <w> they've </w> managed, for 15 days before this concert,
to be at their instruments at seven am in the morning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#13:1>
And all for a cause far removed from the hard rock sensibilities of
the majority of their peers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#14:1>
But suggest to any of them that the giving of that time has been
a sacrifice, and the vehemence of their denial will surprise you.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#15:1>
Playing western classical music is something they want to do, they
will have you know.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#16:1>
Ashwin <w> D'Souza </w> , 18, who began playing the violin at the age
of five, went on to the piano and then to the cello at 14, will tell you of
how he actually strove hard to get into a local medical college just so he
could continue with his stint with the BCO.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#17:1>
<quote> " I choose to give my Sunday mornings, willingly, to
orchestra practices," </quote> he says.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#18:1>
Noel <w> D'Souza </w> , 22, who taught himself the piano at five,
plays second violin with the BCO, and also plays part-time for Hindi films
and ad commercials.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#19:1>
And he insists that he wasn't interested in socialising anyway, so
giving up the time was no big deal either.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#20:1>
Marlisa Veigas, 27, and a violinist with the BCO for eight years now,
says <w> she'd </w> choose a practice any day over a party if it came to
making that choice.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#21:1>
It is something they schedule time for in their lives, as Christina
Fernandes, the 20-year-old oboe player, will tell you.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#22:1>
And Kenneth <w> D'Souza </w> , an FYBA student at St Xaviers, who
plays the double bass, agrees. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#23:1>
But for young people to dedicate themselves to music in Bombay
today, even if they be so willing, is not easy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#24:1>
Jini Dinshaw, who, along with Ernavaz Bharucha, is in charge of the
BCO, still smarts at Zubin <w> Mehta's </w> recent comments on how young
musical talent can be tapped, as in Japan and Korea, only if they move away
from their own cultural music.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#25:1>
The deciding factor for developing talent is not a moving away from a
national form, she insists; it is the provision of opportunity to enhance and
exploit that talent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#26:1>
London examiners have found great potential in the pupils they test
here, she points out, but Bombay has no academy of music to offer its young
prodigies a chance to explore their genius.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#27:1>
In countries like Korea and Japan, she tells us, there is a constant
influx of the best French and Russian teachers coming in to teach at the
music schools, and their students go on to teach another generation - -
ensuring that talent is constantly fostered and encouraged.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#28:1>
In Bombay, the BCO, handicapped by a lack of funds, can only invite
foreign teachers for a period of four weeks a year, through the sponsorship
of the British Council and the Max Mueller Bhavan.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#29:1>
The students of the brass and wind section are further hampered by
the total absence of local teachers and must only rely on these workshops,
and then on Arnavaz and <w> Jini's </w> encouragement to keep them going.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#30:1>
<quote> " We need an academy of music here desperately," </quote>
Jini says, <quote> " Because our talent is going largely untapped.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#31:1>
Nowhere in the world have students ably played in a symphonic
orchestra after just two years, but there is nothing here to give them the
incentive to make music anything but an extracurricular activity." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#32:1>
In the face of such difficulty and at a time when youth
everywhere is tripping on MTV and its Channel V <indig> avatar </indig> ,
what draws these young people to the relative unfamiliar field of western
classical music?

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#33:1>
<quote> " It is the influence of their parents that is so important,"
</quote> stresses Jini.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#34:1>
<quote> " Like a child who, untutored, and born with no language
skills, will still learn to understand and put together new words, so will a
child who is exposed to western classical music within the family learn to
appreciate it." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#35:1>
And most of the musicians do come from musical backgrounds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#36:1>
Not only did <w> Marlisa's </w> mother encourage her to take up
playing at 14, she also kept her at her music, when the going got tough.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#37:1>
<w> Ashwin's </w> father, whose medical studies put an end to his
music, actively supports his son through the demands of his calling.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#38:1>
Kenneth <w> D'Souza's </w> sister, herself a student then, had him
sitting on the piano stool, at the age of four and both Noel <w> D'Souza's
</w> father and grandfather played the violin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#39:1>
No doubt, it helps when the rest of the family, whose members have
gone through the same nerve-jangling routine, can tell you that that
cacophony erupting from your violin, too, will pass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#40:1>
Another motivating factor could be the relatively early age at
which the bugle bug bit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#41:1>
Although Jini reveals that she only started playing at the age of 18
for want of opportunity earlier, she also admits that starting early means a
physical flexibility that is tremendously advantageous - - and absolutely
necessary if one is serious about music.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#42:1>
Very young arms will find it much easier to hold a violin than older
ones - - <w> it's </w> very akin to a young <w> gymnast's </w> body adapting
to the contortions required.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#43:1>
And as Marlisa will tell you, <quote> " When you start playing at
five or six, it is in the tension-free world of childhood; and your mind can
absorb better." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#44:1>
Good musicians nurture their art with practice and more practice,
which is difficult to find time for, especially in the fast pace of Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#45:1>
Marlisa admits that she finds even her mandatory 45 minutes
exhausting after a hard day of secreterial work.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#46:1>
But most of the violinists do put aside at least an hour everyday.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#47:1>
Ashwin loses himself in his violin for hours on end at times and
Kenneth puts in at least an hour on the piano each day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#48:1>
Credit for the development of western classical talent in Bombay,
especially when the <w> devotee's </w> own interest in music could easily be
discouraged and thwarted, goes to the benevolent umbrella of the BCO.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#49:1>
For a ridiculously low membership fee of Rs 15 a year, students can
play on instruments ( loaned by the British Council and Max Mueller Bhavan
since the Indian government prohibits the import of instruemnts) which would
otherwise be out of their financial reach, avail of free coaching and have
the chance to play in concerts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#50:1>
Joining at ages as young as nine, they get a chance to hear other
instruments, and choose one that they would like to take up, to feel first
hand what making music is all about.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#51:1>
The students are usually Myra <w> Menzie's </w> students and <w>
Jini's </w> pupils - - some of whom come to her at the age of three and a
half and whom she exposes to the beauty of western classical music through
the medium of play.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#52:1>
When they join the orchestra for their Sunday practices, they must
sit out at least one concert, because the tension of letting an entire
section down is a risk too great to take.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#53:1>
And they may have to wait longer till Jini or Ernavaz decide they are
ready.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#54:1>
But clearly it is an experience worth waiting for.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#55:1>
For many of the musicians, being part of the orchestra is a dream
come true.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#56:1>
<quote> " Learning alone doesn't teach you co-ordination; it is only
with others that you really make music," </quote> enthuses Christina.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#57:1>
<quote> " As you spend more time in the orchestra, taking on the
increasing responsibility of playing more precise notes in a shorter amount
of time, your sense of responsibility, your maturity, also heightens,"
</quote> says Kenneth, who joined the BCO accidentally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#58:1>
<quote> " My friend, Joseph Gomes, whyo is with the orchestra, asked
me whether I wanted to fill in the vacant slot of a double bassist, and I
went, imagining that I would be playing the cello.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#59:1>
I got a shock when I first saw that double bass - - your had to stand
and play it, it had a heavy bow and the strings are fat.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#60:1>
But I went on, because with my piano playing, I could read the music
easily, and my left hand could cope with the strain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#61:1>
The BCO," </quote> he goes on to state, <quote> " takes the place of
the missing school of music in Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#62:1>
It exposes you to a wide range of instruments and to all the
different eras of music - - right from the baroque, classical to the romantic
and modern - - which is invaluable to those studying music seriously."
</quote> The BCO, Noel adds, <quote> " forces you to get your sight-reading
act together, to listen to the other instruments, to play together.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#63:1>
And how! Mario Nazareth, conductor of the Cathedral and himself a
Licentiate of the London Trinity College of Music, with a <w> performer's
</w> diploma in pianoforte playing, is all praise for the enthusiastiic
talent in the BCO.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#64:1>
" The backbone of the BCO - - the string section - - is very good.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#65:1>
Visiting conductors ( again sponsored by the British Council and Max
Mueller Bhavan) have always been very happy with their performance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#66:1>
And the achievement of other standard comes despite the fact that
they only receive conveyance money for their efforts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#67:1>
Many of them travel from distant suburbs to give their time
unstintingly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#68:1>
And the feeling of blending among them is very good; together, they
follow a <w> conductor's </w> cue well." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#69:1>
Still, however seriously the young instrumentalists may take
their musical pursuits, and however good they are, they all recognise that,
in India, there is a minimal scope for music as a career - - except as a
teacher.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#70:1>
<quote> " Music as a career in India is a risky thing to bank on,"
</quote> says Ashwin, <quote> " You always need something to fall back on."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#71:1>
While Kenneth jokes that he may take up teaching music when he
retires, Noel is working to assure himself of a job by also learning
computers, even as he plays on interesting commercials like the ones for
Damania Airways or Monte Carlo on shifts of four hours each.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#72:1>
<quote> " Working in the music industry like I do is difficult.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#73:1>
<w> It's </w> paying but getting the assignments is hard.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#74:1>
The field of film music offers you no recognition, no promotions, no
benefits, and only wages for assignemnts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#75:1>
It cannot be a career." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#76:1>
But just because they are realistic enough to know it holds no
monetary promise doesn't mean they have regrets about the time they have
spent on it already.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#77:1>
<quote> " It is not possible to regret giving your time to music,"
</quote> says Marlisa, <quote> " It soothes your life." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#78:1>
As Noel puts it, <quote> " Time spent on music is time well spent: I
would have done nothing else more worthwhile in that time." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#79:1>
It doesn't mean that they are unaware of the fact that friends and
acquaintances don't always think nice things about what they do.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#80:1>
<quote> " My friends say they don't understand the music," </quote>
says Noel, <quote> " but then you need to spend time with it for that.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#81:1>
<w> I've </w> often been teased - - that I play a coffin, when a
guitar is more <quote> ` hep'." </quote> </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#82:1>
<quote> " It doesn't bother me," </quote> insists Marlisa.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#83:1>
Kenneth feels people appreciate the fact that he remains faithful to
the piano when <quote> " the rest of the world is playing the more
accessible, easier-to-master and more popular keyboards.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#84:1>
You never get the same fullness of sound on the keyboards, as you
will on a piano," </quote> he reveals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#85:1>
They have weighed the options, and found their own way the best.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#86:1>
Christine: <quote> " I listen to pop, rock, some Indian classical <*>
dotted line</*>" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#87:1>
<quote> " Everything but hard rock," </quote> says Noel.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#88:1>
But their choice seems clear.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#89:1>
<quote> " Rap," </quote> says Kenneth vehemently, <quote> " is no
longer music - - <w> it's </w> rhythm and words.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#90:1>
Music should be harmony and melody; without harmony, there can be no
music." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#91:1>
Bombay, then, has discerning musical genius.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#92:1>
Says Jini, <quote> " I have an eight-year-old Bengali boy, Jeet
Majumdar, studying with me now, <w> who's </w> playing Bach double concertos
after just a year and a half.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#93:1>
And he will most probably transfer to the Menuhin school." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#94:1>
Losing young musical genius is something that is almost inevitable,
Jini feels, especially when, after studying abroad, talent like that of the
outstanding flautist Dilshad Billimoria ( now at <w> London's </w> Royal
Academy) and her brother Farhad ( now in Vienna ) have nothing to come back
to.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#95:1>
Marialena Fernandes, another outstanding pianist, is now teaching at
the Vienna Academy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#96:1>
<quote> " If we want our young people to come back and pass on their
knowledge, we must offer them some concrete way they can help," </quote> Jini
says.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#97:1>
<quote> " But, at a time when even singing has been stopped in so
many schools, all I can do is hope and dream." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-009#98:1>
And so her BCO students go on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#99:1>
Devoting Sunday morning to an aboe and violin and chords and tempo,
rather than a sleep-in and bacon and eggs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#100:1>
Looking forward to concerts, even though they mean practices at
seven in the morning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#101:1>
If music soothes the savage breast, its glory can be seen, untamed,
in the hands of young musicians <w> who've </w> made an ancient choice.

<ICE-IND:W2B-009#102:1>
This is one lot of youth that Channel V will not conquer. </p> </I>
