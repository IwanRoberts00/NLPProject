<ICE-IND:S2A-006#1:1:A>
<w> It's </w> uh <,> time now <,,> to begin the last journey
<,,> from <indig> Teen Murti </indig> <,,> where he has been lying still <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#2:1:A>
Twenty second afternoon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#3:1:A>
And here <,> <indig> Shakti Sthal </indig> <,,> ten kilometres <,,>
the banks of the Yamuna <,,> next to his mother <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#4:1:A>
On the night of this twenty first May <,,> the laugh of her life
<,,> was brutely snatched away <,,> making a reality of a worst tragedy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#5:1:A>
Most often she was by his side <,,> <?> whether rain or shine </?>
<,,> but not too strong <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#6:1:A>
This time <,,> <&> noise </&> life at <indig> Teen Murti </indig>
and around the country fly half mast <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#7:1:A>
Grief stricken people <,> have been queing for hours and through the
night <,,> since that fateful night of the twenty first <,,> to pay homage
<,,> to a young and vigorous leader <,,> with a boyish smile and a jaunty
step <,> that endeared him to so many <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#8:1:A>
Still and silent now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#9:1:A>
Swollen crowds <,,> wear a mute testimony <,> to the closing chapter
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#10:1:A>
He leaves his wife and two children bereft <,,> and the nation
plunged in destiny <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#11:1:A>
The scene of twenty years of his life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#12:1:A>
<indig> Teen Murti </indig> has recorded the joys and trivia <,,>
his ecstasies <,,> and the agonies <,,> of three generations of his time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#13:1:A>
A large number <,> almost forty <,,> of visiting dignitories from
around the world attending today <,,> pay tribute to this young leader <,,>
who was a charming and versatile diplomat <,,> a loving father <,,> a good
friend <,,> of his country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#14:1:A>
The state funeral with full military honour <,,> begins in a short
while from now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#15:1:A>
The gun carriage <,,> the guest and <?> slouch </?> <,,> carries to
the scene <,,> for a <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#16:1:A>
Rajiv Gandhi the son of <,> Indira Gandhi and grandson of
Jawaharlal Nehru <,,> bore the mantle of political responsibility <,> easily
<,,> if with a certain reluctance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#17:1:A>
Once he did so <,,> he threw himself heart and soul into the role
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#18:1:A>
He was in a hurry for change and progress <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#19:1:A>
A driving force <,,> into the twenty-first century <,,> which <,,>
he will now <,> never see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#20:1:A>
Priyanka <,,> consoling her mother <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#21:1:A>
Priyanka <,> consoling her mother <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#22:1:A>
Losing a husband <,,> losing a father <,,> a loving friend whose
smile could charm a heart of stone <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#23:1:A>
For them <,,> he was not a leader or Prime Minister or politician
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#24:1:A>
He was papa <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#25:1:A>
The funeral procession will be led by Major General S C Kashyap
<,,> General Officer commanding Delhi area <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#26:1:A>
Two platoons of the army one of the Navy and two of the Airforce
<,,> accompany the gun carriage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#27:1:A>
Immediately behind the gun carriage <,,> comes a firing party <,,>
which will be followed by the chief mourners <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#28:1:A>
The mourners in uniform <,,> and those not in uniform <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#29:1:A>
Forty officers of the three services <,,> of the rank of Major
General or Brigadier <,,> have maintained continuous vigil <,,> from two <w>
O'clock </w> <,,> on the twenty second <,,> till now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#30:1:A>
<indig> Teen Murti </indig> is <,> at the moment <,,> a novice of
the quite <,,> with the chanting people outside the world <,,> and stretching
<,,> the heart <,,> right down the route <,,> of the <indig> Shakti Sthal
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#31:1:A>
Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar <,,> <&> shouting in the background
</&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#32:1:A>
And for us the people of India <,,> we have many bleeding hearts to
heal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#33:1:A>
We have yet another scar <,,> on the fabric of our country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#34:1:A>
A <O> one word </O> of another assassination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#35:1:A>
We have to struggle once again <,,> for that political maturity
<,,> that will allow the voice of democracy <,,> to be heard unhindered <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#36:1:A>
When leaders <,,> do not have to fall <,,> at the altar of our
insecurity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#37:1:A>
From around the world <,,> international leaders have expressed
their shock <,,> grief <,,> hurt <,,> indignation <,,> and today many of them
have come or sent their representatives <,,> to pay their last respects <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#38:1:A>
I never thought I would have to witness this scene again <,,>
within a span of six and a half years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#39:1:A>
A day of tragedy <,> a day of shame <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#40:1:A>
He played the game in a stupendous drive of energy and committment
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#41:1:A>
He went from state to state <,> knowing the people with a tireless
drive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#42:1:A>
Now <,,> a martyr to democracy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#43:1:A>
And why <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#44:1:A>
Why the best reluctant politician <,,> who sacrificed <,,> his
professional flying career to join his mother after his <w> brother's </w>
death <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#45:1:A>
Why that this dynamic young man <,,> who took success and defeat in
a stride have to be struck down <,,> when he was playing the game according
to the rule <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#46:1:A>
Now still <,,> silent <,,> shattered <,,> forever suspended <,,> in
a tragedy <,,> in a nightmarish act that defies all norms of justice and
fairplay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#47:1:A>
The childhood years of Rajiv Gandhi were spent here <,,> happy
years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#48:1:A>
Where now his body lies in <O> one word </O> <,,> cold <,> and
still <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#49:1:A>
Fate <,,> and assassin <,,> have claimed the lives <,,> of the
mother <,,> and her two sons <,,> in a span <,,> of a little over one decade
<,,> <&> shouting in the background </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#50:1:A>
Too young to die <,,> too young to be a martyr <,,> too full of
life and plans for the future <,,> to be struck down so brutally <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#51:1:A>
Apart from close friends and relatives <,,> the main three pall
bearers <,,> will be the chiefs of the Army <,> Navy and Airforce <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#52:1:A>
General S F Rodrigues <,,> Admiral L Ramdas <,> and Airchief
Marshall S K Mehra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#53:1:A>
Helicopter patrolling the sky <,> security <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#54:1:A>
As they lift him <,> from what was home for twenty years <,,> to
bring him out to the gun carriage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#55:1:A>
Till eleven <w> O'clock </w> this morning the crowds were here <,,>
paying their last respects <,,> and then <,,> there were moments of privacy
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#56:1:A>
The helicopter showering petals <,,> as the body is brought out
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#57:1:A>
As the helicopter showers petals <,,> on the gun carriage <,,> he
is now <,,> handed over <,,> to the people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#58:1:A>
Moments to be <,> recorded in history <,,> memories to be engraved
on our hearts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#59:1:A>
They called him <,,> one of the brightest and bravest sons of India
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#60:1:A>
They called it <,,> a blow to Indian politics <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#61:1:A>
They called out <,> a shock nation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#62:1:A>
<{> <[> Now </[> in slow march <,,> the procession begins <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#63:1:A>
And so he leaves <,,> <indig> Teen Murti </indig> <,,> for the last
march <,,> to the banks of the Yamuna <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#64:1:A>
We capture it on film <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#65:1:A>
We give him the ceremony <,,> but there are no words <,,> to
express <,,> the heinousness <,,> of this crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#66:1:A>
Too young to die <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-006#67:1:X>
<[> Now </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-006#68:1:A>
Our next live telecast <,,> will be when the gun carriage <,,>
and the procession arrives at Cannaught Circle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#69:1:A>
In between <,,> recorded excerpts from supporting camera crew <,,>
will be brought to you from Vijay Chowk and India Gate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#70:1:A>
We now return you from <indig> Teen Murti </indig> <,,> to the
studios of <indig> Doordarshan </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#71:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> now speaking to you from the studios of <indig>
Doordarshan </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#72:1:A>
These are the scenes captured by our supporting camera crew <,> as
the funeral procession <,> moves towards Vijay chowk <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#73:1:A>
It is now moving on towards Cannaught Circle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#74:1:A>
The people have been waiting at Vijay Chowk <,,> from noon <,,>
unmindful of the scorching heat <,,> just to catch <,,> a final glimpse <,>
of their beloved leader <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#75:1:A>
Perhaps <,> Summer afternoon with the temperature in <?> there </?>
forty <,,> the crowds braving the May heat <,,> waiting along the routes <,,>
to catch final glimpse <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#76:1:A>
The funeral procession winding its way <,> at snail pace <,,>
towards <indig> Shakti Sthal </indig> <,> on the banks of the Yamuna <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#77:1:A>
The route is long <,,> ten kilometres <,,> from <indig> Teen Murti
</indig> <,,> to <indig> Shakti Sthal </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#78:1:A>
Mortal remains of the ex-Prime Minister <,,> move slowly down <,,>
to its final destination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#79:1:A>
People rushing breaking the cordon to have a last glimpse <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#80:1:A>
With full <,> military honours <,,> the tunes of the Army <,> the
Navy <,> and the Airforce <,,> precede <,> the gun carriage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#81:1:A>
The funeral procession is lead by the General Officer commanding
Delhi area <,,> Major General S C Kashyap <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#82:1:A>
Braving the scorching heat <,> they give vent <,,> to their grief
<,,> <&> shouting in the background </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#83:1:A>
And now down <indig> Rajpath </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#84:1:A>
The procession had left <indig> Teen Murti </indig> around one <,>
thirty <,,> and is making very slow progress <,,> as the people <,,> impede
<,,> the route <,,> <&> shouting in the background </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#85:1:A>
We have recorded these scenes because it is not possible to have a
continuous microwave <,> uplink <,,> at all spots along the route <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#86:1:A>
So the next live <,> telecast will be from Cannaught Circle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#87:1:A>
Honours for a young leader <,> cut down in his prime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#88:1:A>
Leaders around the world had expressed <,,> their indignation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#89:1:A>
<quote> We are filled with indignation <,,> over the appaling and
heinous crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#90:1:A>
He was a personal friend of ours </quote> <,,> Mr Gorbachov <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#91:1:A>
The long route to eternity <,,> showered with petals <,,> <&>
Chanting of <indig> mantras </indig> at the background </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-006#92:1:B>
<w> We're </w> now waiting for the funeral procession to
arrive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#93:1:B>
The funeral cortege carrying the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi
on route to this place <,> has been passing through the streets and avenues
of Delhi with surging crowds thronging the routes <,,> bidding farewell to a
beloved leader with tears and emotions <,> in memory to someone who <w> we've
</w> tragically <,> lost forever <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#94:1:B>
And <w> it's </w> a sad and depressive moment as we await the
arrival of the mortal remains of Mr Rajiv Gandhi <,,> here at a spot close to
<indig> Shakti Sthal </indig> where they will be confined to flames <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#95:1:B>
Close by this spot where our former Prime Minister Mrs Indira
Gandhi <,,> Mr Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w> mother was cremated less then seven
years ago <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#96:1:B>
Mrs Gandhi had fallen to the assassins bullets at her residence one
Safdarjang road New Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#97:1:B>
Today as we await the arrival of the mortal remains of Rajiv Gandhi
<,,> it still seems impossible to come to terms with the enormity of this
ghastly and unbelievable tragedy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#98:1:B>
A bad despicable moment <,> a bad night when Rajiv Gandhi was
brutally killed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#99:1:B>
Our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#100:1:B>
Perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and
vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#101:1:B>
There is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional
songs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#102:1:B>
The atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling tragedy that
left behind pain and grief <,,> and inspeakable faith after this abolutely
shameful and dasterdly crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#103:1:B>
As many of here saint says and eyes brimming with tears and <,,>
many left numb by the senseless tragedy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#104:1:B>
We have many world leaders here represented in large numbers <,,>
at Mr Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w> funeral <,,> with over sixty delegations from
the world over <,> <w> who've </w> been coming in since yesterday to pay
their last respect to the <,> departed leader <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#105:1:B>
Large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area
oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#106:1:B>
All here to mourn the loss of our former Prime Minister whom they
loved and cheered <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#107:1:B>
A leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned
their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt <,,> to keep the interests
of the common man <,,> closest to his heart <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#108:1:B>
Today the spot where Mr Rajiv <w> Gandhi's </w> life last rites
are to be performed <,,> was chosen by his daughter Priyanka who visited the
site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how
the arrangements were progressing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#109:1:B>
Not too far away are the spots where Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr
Sanjay Gandhi were cremated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#110:1:B>
And today the mortal remains of <,> Rajiv Gandhi are consigned to
the flames

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#111:1:B>
It will be <,,> a time <w> that'll </w> echo as the last few days
have <,,> some of the bleakest darkest and most depressing moments of our
history <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-006#112:1:B>
In a span of eleven years three members of the Gandhi family <,>
