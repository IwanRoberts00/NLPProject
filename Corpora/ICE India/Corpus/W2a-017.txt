<quote> " <bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> plurality of
meaning reminds one of the old story of blind men coming across an elephant
on the road - - each group in the country sees the same elephant, i.e., <it>
<mention> The Concept of Workers Participation </mention> </it> from a
different angle.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#4:1>
The owners of company thinking it to be <quote> ` snake' </quote> - -
the trunk; the Managers <-> ` </-> up against the landslide - - the belly;
the trade unionists <quote> ` a tree' </quote> - - the leg." </quote> <sp>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#5:1>
The concept of <w> workers' </w> participation in management was
very confusing and we are nonetheless wiser now !

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#6:1>
Mohtras V. G. writing in <it> <mention> Labour Participation in
Management </mention> </it> in 1966 itself observed that participation means
<it> <mention> sharing of decision making power </mention> </it> by rank and
file of an industrial organisation through proper representations at all
levels of management in the entire range of managerial action.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#7:1>
Decision making involves three steps: one should become aware of as
many alternatives as possible which are relevant to the decision, define each
of these alternatives and, exercise choice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#8:1>
Decision making process on any level or sphere should have the scope
of the views of everyone being considered, if there is participation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#9:1>
Participation means <quote> <mention> " having a share take part
</mention> , etc." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#10:1>
The managerial prerogatives should also be shared by everyone.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#11:1>
If the aim is that of Ian Clegg, then <quote> " it implies a
situation where <w> workers' </w> representatives, to some extent, are
involved in the process of management decision making but where the ultimate
power is in the hands of Management" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#12:1>
On the other hand, if one has to follow Dr. Davis <quote> " it is a
mental and emotional involvement of a person in a group situation which
encourages him to contribute to goals and share responsibilities in them."
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#13:1>
In Indian context <w> workers' </w> participation is to bridge the
gap between management supremacy and <w> workers' </w> control by work place
consultation and joint consultation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#14:1>
This can be illustrated as follows: </p> <O> flow chart </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#15:1>
As pointed out by Walker K.E in <it> <mention> <w> Workers's </w>
Participation in Management in practice - - An international perspective,
</mention> </it> there are two basic ideas in the concept of <w> workers'
</w> participation in management: two groups of people in an undertaking - -
managers and workers - - and two separate sets of functions to be performed -
- managerial and operative.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#16:1>
Managerial functions are distinct from operative functions and are
divorced of operative functions, i.e., <w> workers' </w> functions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#17:1>
<w> Workers' </w> participation is essentially aimed at meeting the
psychological needs of workers at work.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#18:1>
Comte & Owen, in early days advocated the participation of workers in
management for achieving distributive social justice.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#19:1>
Karl Marx advocated trade unionism and <w> workers' </w>
participation as an alternative for industrial self-government. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#20:1>
One of the references to <it> <mention> Sachar Committee
</mention> </it> on Companies <O> <*> line on column</*> </O> <O> <fnr> 1.
</fnr> </O> and M.R.T.P. Acts, 1977, is to report the measures by which ( and
at whether ) <w> workers' </w> participation in the share capital and
management of the companies is to be brought about. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#21:1>
In the evidence given before the Committee, <mention> ASSOCHEM
</mention> stated that labour should be given opportunity to participate
meaningfully in the ownership of capital as well as in decision making level,
where the contribution would be meaningful and useful.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#22:1>
But <mention> FICCI </mention> argued that <quote> " it was not
advisable to rush through the legislation without properly preparing the way
by ensuring that the concept of <w> workers' </w> participation is readily
acceptable before introducing any Act <+> " </+> </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#23:1>
The <mention> INTUC </mention> advocated the <quote> " labour are
equal partners in the establishment and, therefore, should have equal
representation, with the shareholders on the board to ensure co-determination
as is found in Germany" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#24:1>
The <mention> ClTU </mention> averred that it is not possible so long
as the primary motive oF production is an individual profit and also
maintained that no scheme of <w> workers' </w> participation can be
successfully implemented without changing the basic direction of economic
policies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#25:1>
<mention> CITU </mention> , however, demand that <w> workers' </w>
representatives be given <quote> ` equal status' </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#26:1>
The <it> <mention> Sachar Committee </mention> </it> did not
adequately answer the terms of reference like comparing with French Law where
there is some provision for setting apart a part of profit of the company.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#27:1>
The Committee was expected to go into the question oF incorporation
oF provisions required to be made to prevent mismanagement with reference to
safeguarding of <w> company's </w> interests and the public interest.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#28:1>
However, the Committee did make some drafting changes in the
provisions of the Companies Act and suggested some changes in the procedure
and administrative machinery.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#29:1>
The Committee felt that their recommendations would mean meaningful
participation by workers on the boards of companies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#30:1>
The Committee recommended <w> workers' </w> participation at board
level in companies with more than 1000 workmen ( as defined in the Industrial
Disputes Act ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#31:1>
They also suggested consultations regarding the proportion of
worker-directors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#32:1>
The choice of worker director was to be only from amongst the workmen
with a tenure of 3 years.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#33:1>
To quote the <w> Committee's </w> own word: <quote> " in order to
ensure effective participation by <w> worker's </w> representatives at the
board level section 292 ( of the Companies Act ) should be amended.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#34:1>
Worker-director should not be barred from board meetings because of
section 299 / 380 of the Companies Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#35:1>
For proper performance, worker-directors should be given training in
commercial law, etc." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#36:1>
The Committee expressed the hope <quote> " that the participation of
workmen at the top management level in a company will lead to greater
industrial harmony <*> dotted line</*>" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#37:1>
In December 1983 the Government introduced a comprehensive scheme
on <w> workers' </w> participation in management, operating at the shop floor
and plant levels.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#38:1>
The approach to Eighth Plan envisages to <-> " </-> base labour
relations to <w> workers' </w> participation and concern for productivity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#39:1>
It is, perhaps, in this background, that the present Bill is
introduced. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 937 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#40:1>
<h> <bold> OBJECTS OF THE BILL </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#41:1>
The objects of the Bill are based on Article 43- a of the
Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#42:1>
In the Statement of Objectives, it is stated, <quote> " the
non-statutory schemes have not been able to provide an effective framework
for a meaningful participation of workers in management at all levels"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#43:1>
The Bill is, therefore, aimed to <quote> " provide for specific and
meaningful participation of workers in management at shop floor level,
establishment level and board of management level" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#44:1>
This would mean that at the shop floor level the elected person works
as <quote> " manager" </quote> and becomes an addition to the existing
persons and superceding even a supervisor!.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#45:1>
Perhaps, what is intended is <quote> " specific and meaningful
participation in management of workers at shop floor level <*> dotted
line</*>" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#46:1>
In Europe, where <w> employees' </w> representation on the board is
quite common, the management structure follows the two-tier pattern initially
evolved in Germany.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#47:1>
Essentially, the system consists of a <quote> ` management board'
</quote> and <quote> ` the advisory or supervisory board' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#48:1>
The management board consists of senior executives of the company
exercising substantial managerial powers while the supervisory / advisory
board consists of workers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#49:1>
The advantages of the two-tier board over a unitary board have been
broadly accepted by the western countries.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#50:1>
The <it> <mention> Sachar Committee </mention> </it> never favoured
the two tier board itself since it raises problems of demarcating precisely
the functions of two boards in the Indian context.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#51:1>
The Committee felt that introducing three formal layers of authority
with inevitable overlapping would not be conducive to efficiency and quick
decision making. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#52:1>
Management means skillful treatment and a manager is one <quote>
" who controls a business" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#53:1>
Section 2 ( 24 ) of the Companies Act defines <quote> ` Manager'
</quote> as <quote> " an individual who, subject to the supreintendence of
control and direction of the board of directors has the management of the
whole, or substantially the whole of the affairs of a company <*> dotted
line</*>" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#54:1>
The preamble of the Bill deals with <quote> " participation of
workers in the management of undertakings, <it> <mention> establishments
</mention> </it> or other organisations engaged in any <it> industry </it>
and to provide for <*> dotted line</*>" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#55:1>
Clause 2 ( k ) of the Bill states: <quote> " words and
expressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 ( 14 of 1947 ) shall have the meanings respectively
assigned to them in that Act" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#56:1>
The term <quote> ` establishment' </quote> is covered by the Shops
and Establishments Act and not by the Industrial Disputes Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#57:1>
The term industry has attracted a number of judicial decisions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#58:1>
Section 2 ( j ) of the Industrial Disputes Act reads as follows:
<quote> " industry means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or
calling of employees and includes any calling, service, employment,
handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#59:1>
( The term <quote> ` workmen' </quote> is related to industry ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#60:1>
The word <quote> ` undertaking' </quote> means <quote> " anything
undertaken or any business etc." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#61:1>
The widest ( wildest ! ) possible amplitude to the word <quote> "
industry" </quote> has been given by Krishna Iyer, J. ( and concurred in by
others ) in the seven judge bench of the Supreme Court in the famous case of
<it> <mention> Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board </mention> </it> [
1978 Lab-lC 467 ( SC) ] . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#62:1>
Clause 2 ( e ) defines <quote> ` other worker' </quote> to mean a
worker other than a workman, while clause 2 ( i ) defines worker as <quote> "
any person employed in any industrial establishment to do any manual,
unskilled, skilled, technical operational, clerical, supervisory, managerial
or administrative work <*> dotted line</*>" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#63:1>
However, <quote> ` workman' </quote> is defined to mean any worker
but not a person employed in a managerial or administrative capacity; or a
person in but supervisory who draws wages exceeding Rs. 1600 per month <*>
dotted line</*> <-> " </-> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#64:1>
Section 2 ( s ) of the Industrial Disputes Act while dealing with the
word <quote> " workmen" </quote> has drawn a number of court cases including
the Supreme Court.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#65:1>
Unlike the Industrial Disputes Act, a difference is sought to be
brought about between worker and workman in the Participation of Workers in
Management Bill.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#66:1>
A workman may be a worker who is not a supervisor, manager, etc. but
a worker is a person employed in managerial capacity also.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#67:1>
The normal connotation of the word <quote> ` workers' </quote> is
<quote> " a person who works" </quote> ( <it> <mention> Oxford Advanced
Learners Dictionary </mention> </it> ) and a <quote> ` workman' </quote> is a
<quote> " man who earns a living by physical labour or at machines, etc. or
person who works in a specified way" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#68:1>
The question that arises is - - why should there be another clause
mentioning about <quote> ` other worker' </quote> when a worker is other than
a workman.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#69:1>
The whole definition seems to create more confusion even to a layman !
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#70:1>
Clause 2 ( b ) defines <quote> ` Board of Management' </quote>
and the links to body corporate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#71:1>
<quote> ` Body corporate' </quote> is defined under section 2 ( 7 )
of the Companies Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#72:1>
Management of a company is always through a board.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#73:1>
The term <quote> ` body corporate' </quote> is much wider than an
undertaking, industry or establishment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#74:1>
Clauses 4 and 5 deal with shop councils, where <w> workmen's </w>
representative will be decided and the <it> <foreign> <mention> modus
operandi </mention> </foreign> </it> of these councils.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#75:1>
Unless IPC is taken cognizance of, workmen may not include workwomen !
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#76:1>
Clause 6, which deals with <quote> ` Board of Management'
</quote> would simply mean that every board of management in any industrial
establishment shall have persons to represent workmen and other workers,
subject to certain percentage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#77:1>
Clause 8 deals with <quote> ` offences' </quote> and fastens the
responsibility on the person <quote> " incharge of and responsible to the
company for the conduct of business of the company" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#78:1>
This would mean that the <quote> " worker", " other worker" </quote>
or <quote> " workman" </quote> representative in the board or at any other
level is exempt, since they are only <quote> " representative persons"
</quote> and not <quote> " worker directors" </quote> though clause 6 ( 5 )
mentions that the representative shall exercise the powers and discharge all
the functions of a member of the board of management and shallbe entitled to
vote !

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#79:1>
Again the question: that arises is - - will the definition of <quote>
` Member' </quote> under section 2 ( 27 ) of Companies Act apply ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#80:1>
Under section 2 ( 27 ) of Companies Act, a member would mean a
shareholder.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#81:1>
If a workman who is not a shareholder of a company can become a
member of the board of management, the provisions of the Companies Act may be
violated and, therefore, every company may have to change the articles of
association with appurtinent consequences, particularly where some
qualifications have been prescribed for directors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#82:1>
Clause 13 lays down that the provisions of this Act shall have
effect notwithstanding inconsistencies with other Acts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#83:1>
This, perhaps takes, care of section 253, 256, 259, 260 or 263 of the
Companies Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#84:1>
But what about removal of a director ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#85:1>
Perhaps, the question will not arise, since the board of management
has only a representative with full powers of a director divested of
accountability. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#86:1>
Clause 16 is the crux of the Bill.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#87:1>
This section states that section <O> [ CONTINUED ON PAGE 940 ] </O>
<O> <&> page </&> 938 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#88:1>
<O> <h> PARTICIPATION OF WORKERS IN MANAGEMENT BILL, 1990 </O> <O> [
<it> CONTINUED FROM PAGE 938 ] </it> </O> 3 of the Industrial Disputes Act
which deals with works committees shall be omitted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#89:1>
These committees are like the joint production committees in U.S.A.,
Russia and Britain.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#90:1>
The object and purpose of these committees are three-fold - - ( a)
voluntary negotiation; ( b) mediation and conciliation; and ( c) arbitration
/ adjudication.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#91:1>
The main function of these committees is to secure and preserve amity
and good employer-employee relations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#92:1>
They are concerned with normal day-to day working problems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#93:1>
By the addition of clause 16 at the end of the Bill, it looks as
though the entire Bill is aimed at replacing these committees with a
three-tier committee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#94:1>
This repeal runs contrary to the objects and reasons appended to the
Bill. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-017#95:1>
Viewed from all the above angles, it is clear that the
recommendations of Sachar Committee do not seem to have been taken into
consideration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-017#96:1>
The terms and definitions in the Bill are bound to attract
litigations and judicial inferences. </p> <*> square </*>
