<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#3:1>
IN its Report on Currency and Finance for 1989-90, the Reserve
Bank of India has forecast a higher deficit in the current year and has
called for adjustments to reduce the serious fiscal imbalance in order to
foster growth with stability.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#4:1>
The forecast is based on an assessment of the economy in which the
actual deficit at the end of March, 1991 would turn out to be larger than
what was budgeted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#5:1>
The actual budget deficit of the Union Government was Rs. 13,000
crores on November 30 last as compared to Rs. 13,082 crores in the
corresponding period of 1989.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#6:1>
The budget deficit as on January 11, 1991 was still higher at Rs.
15.093 crores.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#7:1>
The Indian Economy has entered a period of growth stagnation on the
one hand and inflation on the other.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#8:1>
The agricultural sector has been relatively better for the past three
sessions - - thanks to good monsoons - - but it is not significant enough to
push the economy to a higher level of growth, largely because of decline in
growth that has set in the industrial sector.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#9:1>
The good performance of agriculture has been largely offset by the
setback in the industrial sector especially in 1990-91. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#10:1>
The composite index of six infrastructure industries e.g. power,
petroleum, crude, refinery products, saleable steel, coal and cement,
recorded a <quote> " sharp deceleration" </quote> in the growth rate to
3.5 % in the current year as compared to 6.5 % in the comparable period of
the preceding year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#11:1>
While output in absolute terms may have increased, it has fallen
short of the targets set.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#12:1>
The RBI report has attributed the rise in growth rates both in the
general index of industrial production and in the manufacturing sector in the
first seven months to the low base of the comparable period of the previous
year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#13:1>
The <quote> " depressing performance" </quote> of the
infrastructure industries as well as the lower availability of imported raw
materials and components consequent on the balance of payments crisis will
have an adverse impact on the overall industrial production in the current
year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#14:1>
The anticipated growth rate of industrial output at around 6 to 7
percent in the current year as compared to 8.6 percent in 1989-90 reflects a
significant downturn and thus the overall performance of the economy is a
mixed one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#15:1>
While the agricultural sector scenario is encouraging, with the
exceptionally good South-West monsoon in 1990, leading to a record Kharif
foodgrain output of about 102 million tonnes, as against the target of 95
million tonnes, prospects for 1991-92 would depend as much on favourable
weather as on better management of supply of inputs and remunerative prices.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#16:1>
The prospects for commercial crops, with the exception of groundnut,
have also been satisfactory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#17:1>
But the country needs to do more to increase oilseeds production to
reduce the drain on foreign exchange through imports of edible oils and to
lower the domestic prices of this essential commodity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#18:1>
The stagnation in industrial sector is accompanied by high prices
which do not induce producers to improve the supplies of goods and services.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#19:1>
From all directions there is indication of possible worsening of the
price situation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#20:1>
Meanwhile, the trade gap is widening and net inflows of foreign
currency deposits are declining.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#21:1>
With the continuing decline in foreign exchange reserves, essential
imports to keep the wheels of industry moving are difficult to provide for.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#22:1>
The rate of inflation as measured by the wholesale price index is
likely to touch 13 percent by the end of the year ( March, 1991 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#23:1>
One way to control inflation would be by mopping up excess liquidity
in the economy through fiscal measures and by controlling non-productive
expenditure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#24:1>
Resources invested on creating productive assets must start giving
returns by accelerating the production process.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#25:1>
The infrastructure industries should be given special attention so
that industrial growth is enabled to regain its lost momentum. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#26:1>
In overcoming the current stagnation and in controlling
inflation hard decisions are called for.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#27:1>
There will have to be incentives to produce more and export more and
for achieving this objective, resources will have to be directed to
productive purposes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#28:1>
All this cannot be done through budgetary measures alone.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#29:1>
Some clearcut policy initiatives will be necessary, though in
siphoning off excess liquidity fiscal and monetary policies will come handy.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#30:1>
Now that a full-fledged budget is no to be presented and instead
a vote on account will be taken, a period of uncertainty is ahead and the
tasks of fiscal correction and launching of the Eighth Plan with a clear
demarcation of the roles of the public and the private sectors have taken
a back seat, at any rate for the present. </I>

The author maintains that the companies, irrespective of the

continue to submit the accounts for the <quote> " previous year" </quote> for
the purpose of income-tax assessment if the company had been uniformly

<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> amendment to Section 209
of the <it> Companies Act, 1956 </it> requires the companies to follow
accrual basis and double entry system of accounting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#35:2>
Section 209 ( 3 ) further states that proper books of account shall
not be deemed to have been kept if such books are not on accrual basis and
according to double entry system of accounting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#36:2>
Companies had different accounting years and the <quote> "
previous year" </quote> under the Income-tax Act for the purpose of taxation
which was decided in accordance with Section 3 as it stood prior to
amendments brought by the <it> Direct Tax Laws ( Amendment ) Act, 1987. </it>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#37:2>
The amendment to Section 3 has brought in the concept of uniform
accounting year for the purpose of income-tax assessment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#38:2>
<it> The </it> section <it> inter alia </it> provides that with
effect from 1st April 1989 <quote> " previous year" </quote> for the purpose
of the Act means the financial year immediately preceding the assessment
year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#39:2>
In order to comply with the uniform accounting year under the
Income-tax Act, many companies have changed their accounting year and
close their books of accounts on 31st March.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#40:2>
However, there is no amendment to Companies Act requiring
companies to adopt the accounting year from April to March and, therefore,
quite a few companies have continued to <O> <*> line in column</*> </O>
follow an accounting period different from financial year. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#41:2>
<h> <bold> Method of Accounting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#42:2>
In the past, companies have been following cash or hybrid or
mercantile system of accounting, but it has now become incumbent upon them
to switch over to accrual basis following the amendment to Section 209 ( 3 ) .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#43:2>
The accrual system of accounting has been defined in para 1.06
of the ICAI guidance note of 1983 on Terms used in Financial Statements.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#44:2>
As an accounting concept, accrual <O> <&> tantalizer 1 </&> </O>
basis is not different from mercantile basis. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#45:2>
In accordance with Section 145 of <it> Income-tax Act, 1961,
</it> the income chargeable under the head <quote> " profits and gains of
business or profession" </quote> or <quote> " Income from other sources"
</quote> shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting
regularly employed by the assessee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#46:2>
It is an accepted position that an assessee can adopt either
mercantile system or cash system <it> [ ( CIT. vs Chunilal vs Mehta & Sons P.
Ltd 82 ITR 55 ( SC ) ] . </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#47:2>
An assessee can also follow hybrid / heterogeneous system besides
cash / mercantile system according to Supreme Court decision in the matter
of <it> CIT vs Krishnaswami Mudliar, 53 ITR 122. </it>

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#48:2>
It is also to be noted that the applicability of Section 145 of
Income-tax Act is in respect of all the assessees.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#49:2>
This means that non-company assessees can continue to follow cash
or hybrid system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#50:2>
It is also necessary to examine the requirement of tax audit
under Section 44 AB.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#51:2>
In accordance with Section 44 AB, <quote> " Every person ( a)
carrying on business shall, if his total sales, turnover, gross receipt, as
the case may be, in business exceed Rs. 40 <indig> lakh </indig> in any
previous year; or ( b) carrying on profession shall, if his gross receipts in
profession exceed Rs. 10 <indig> lakh </indig> in any previous year,
get his accounts of such previous year audited by an accountant before the
specified date and obtain before that date the report of such audit in the
prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant and setting
forth such particulars as may be prescribed; provided that in a case where
such person is required by or under any other law to get his accounts
audited, it shall be sufficient compliance with the provisions of this
section if such person gets the accounts of such business <O> <&> page </&>
711 </O> audited by an accountant before the specified date and obtain before
that date the report of the audit as required under such other law and a
further report in the form prescribed under this section.<+>"</+> </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#52:2>
The proviso applies to all assessees who are required to get
their accounts audited under any law, and hence it is applicable to
companies also. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#53:2>
In respect of companies having <O> <&> tantalizer 2 </&> </O> an
accounting year other than financial year, say, 31st December, a question
arises as to whether under Section 44 AB of the Income-tax Act the tax
auditor can audit and certify the accounts for the period for which accounts
have been maintained under the Companies Act ( i.e. upto 31st December ) or
whether the tax auditor will have to certify the accounts for the relevant
financial year which is the uniform accounting year for tax purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#54:2>
This matter was referred to <mention> CBDT </mention> , which
vide their circular

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#55:2>
561 dated 22nd May, 1990 has pointed out that as the income of
previous year is chargeable to tax and for the purpose of Income-tax Act, the
previous year is financial year, the tax auditor would have to carry out
the audit under Section 44 AB in respect of the period covered by the
previous year i.e. the relevant financial year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#56:2>
The Board further clarified that the provision of Section 44 AB
covers only the cases where the accounts are audited under any other
law in respect of financial year.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#57:2>
The circular further states that where the accounting year is
different from the financial year, the provisions of Section 44 AB will not
apply.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#58:2>
In such cases, where the <w> company's </w> accounting year is
different from financial year, the tax auditor would have to carry out the
tax audit in respect of the period covered by the relevant financial year and
submit his report in form 3 CB as required by rule 6G ( 1) ( b) of the
Income-tax Rules. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#59:2>
The <mention> CBDT </mention> circular established a fact that
the tax audit under Section 44 AB is not necessarily linked with the
statutory audit under the Companies Act, and therefore, a tax auditor has
to carry out tax audit separately. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#60:2>
The Board has, however, not considered the possibility where a
company which has been maintaining the accounts on cash or hybrid system
and has an accounting year same as <quote> " previous year" </quote> ,
prepares two sets of final accounts - - one under cash or hybrid system (
for income-tax ) and the other on accrual basis ( as required under
Companies Act ) , in the cases where Section 44 AB is applicable and the
cases in which Section 44 AB is not applicable. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#61:2>
However, it can be concluded that the company would be within its
rights ( subject to provisions of Section 145 of Income-tax Act ) to
continue to maintain the accounts for the purpose of Income-tax Act, under
cash or hybrid system and prepare its accounts for the purpose of Companies
Act on accrual basis as required by Section 209 ( 3) of Companies Act.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#62:2>
Where a company having financial year as accounting year and
prepares two sets of accounts, it is necessary to examine whether the
Income-tax department would reject the accounts prepared undercash /
hybrid system, just because the income returned works out to be lower than
the income which would have been worked out on accrual basis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#63:2>
In case the company had been regularly following cash or hybrid
system for the earlier assessment years, the department cannot reject the
cash / hybrid only on the grounds that a separate set of accounts has been
prepared on accrual basis as required under Companies Act. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#64:2>
The power to reject the method of accounting has been split out
in the proviso to Section 145 ( 10 of Income-tax Act ) which is as under:
<bold> Provided </bold> that in any case where the accounts are correct and
complete to the satisfaction of the assessing officer but the method
employed is such that, in the opinion of the assessing officer the income
cannot be properly deduced therefrom, then the computation shall be made
upon such basis and in such manner as the assessing officer may determine.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#65:2>
In order to reject the method of accounting, it is necessary for
the assessing officer to establish that the income cannot be properly deduced
from the method of accounting followed by the assessee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#66:2>
In case a company prepares two sets of accounts, a reconciliation
between the Profit & Loss Account under cash system and the Profit & Loss
account under the mercantile system, can be prepared in order to establish
that the income derived under the cash system is correct. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#67:2>
The Andhra Pradesh High Court has held in <it> CIT vs Margadarsi
Chit Funds P. Ltd., 19 ( Taxman 73 ) </it> that when the assessee has
followed a particular method of accounting and has been regularly following
it, the department must have sufficient material for rejecting the method of
accounting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#68:2>
The learned judge has said that the choice to account for income on
an acceptable basis is that of the assessee and not of the department.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#69:2>
The <w> ITO's </w> power to substitute a system of accounting for the
one followed by the assessee, flows from provisions of Section 145 of the
Income-tax Act.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#70:2>
It is, therefore, imperative that before rejecting the system of
accounting followed by the assessee, the ITO must refer to the inherent
defect in the system and record a clear finding that the true pofit / loss
cannot be deduced from the books of account maintained by the assessee.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#71:2>
As already observed, there is no finding to that effect in this case.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#72:2>
The <w> ITO's </w> view that there could be a better system of
accounting is no reason for application of the provision of Section 145 of
the Act, especially in view of the fact that this system of accounting is
followed by the assessee uniformly and regularly for the past several years
and was accepted by the department without objection. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#73:2>
<h> <bold> Change in Method of Accounting </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#74:2>
The insistence on the method to be followed on regular basis does
not debar the assessees from changing the method of accounting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#75:2>
The assessee is entitled to change the method of accounting, but such
change should arise out of commer- <O> ( Continued on page 720 ) </O> <O> <&>
page </&> 712 </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#76:2>
<h> <bold> Method of Accounting </bold> </h> </O> <O> ( continued
from page 712 ) </O>  cial expediency and also should be a <it> <foreign>
bona fide </foreign> </it> one.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#77:2>
The change in accounting system should not be a casual departure.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#78:2>
In <it> <mention> Padamsee Mulji Ginning & Pressing Co. ( P)
Ltd., 3 ITD 92 ( Bom ) , </mention> </it> the assessee, a holding company,
had advanced loans to its subsidiary companies and interest chargeable on
such loans was regularly being returned by it as its income on accrual basis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#79:2>
Later on the company resolved that interest receivable would be
accounted on cash basis, as the subsidiary companies are in financial
difficulties and, therefore, it did not return any income from this source.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#80:2>
The tribunal held, that so long as there was no <it> <foreign> mala
fide </foreign> </it> motives in changing the method, the assessee could not
be denied the privilege of changing the method of accounting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#81:2>
In the case of <it> <mention> Rajiv Investment ( P) Ltd. vs lTO,
20 ITD 431 ( Cal ) </mention> </it> it was held that if one regular method of
accounting was changed to another method of accounting and followed it
thereafter regularly, the department has to accept such change. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#82:2>
It may be noted that the change in the method of accounting
should be on account of commercial expediency.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#83:2>
In the case of <it> <mention> Deepnarin Nagu & Co I ITD 288 ( Indore )
, </mention> </it> the assessee, after filing the original return of income
duly supported by valid accounts, decided to switch over from mercantile to
cash system of accounting and filed revised return of income supported by
revised sets of accounts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#84:2>
The ITO and AAC declined to accept the revised return, holding
that the change in the system of accounting being not on account of
commercial expediency but was only an afterthought.

<ICE-IND:W2A-015#85:2>
The Tribunal confirmed the view, holding that the assessee has
not proved that the change was <it> <foreign> bona fide </foreign> </it> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#86:2>
The companies which plan to maintain accounts for income-tax
purpose as per cash or hybrid system and mercantile basis for Companies Act,
as against mercantile basis earlier followed for income-tax as well as
Companies Act, should ensure that sufficient evidence is placed on record to
prove that the change is necessitated by commercial expediency. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-015#87:2>
It can therefore be concluded that companies, irrespective of the
accounting year followed by them for the purpose of <it> <mention>
Companies Act, 1956, </mention> </it> can continue to submit the accounts for
the <quote> " previous year" </quote> for the purpose of income-tax
assessments, if the company had been uniformly and regularly following the
said system in the past. </p> <&> tantalizer 1 on page 711, column two </&>
