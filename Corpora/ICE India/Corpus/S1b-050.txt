<ICE-IND:S1B-050#1:1:A>
Hello viewers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#2:1:A>
Nearly all aspects of Journalism have been undergoing a
metamorphisis in recent times <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#3:1:A>
Wide ranging changes have gripped the media

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#4:1:A>
Some for the better

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#5:1:A>
Some for the worse <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#6:1:A>
The glossies as they are called <,> have come to stay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#7:1:A>
And even seem to be thriving <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#8:1:A>
Uh there has been a wave of Investigative Journalism <,> uh which
has brought along controversies of its own

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#9:1:A>
Today we have with us <,> Mr Dileep Padgaonkar the editor of
<mention> The Times Of India </mention> who will speak to us on the modern
trends in journalism today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#10:1:A>
Mr Padgaonkar <,> has a Ph D <,> in Philosophy from <?> Sourgone
</?> Paris <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#11:1:A>
He has been a correspondent of the <mention> Times of India
</mention> in Paris <,> and has <?> worked </?> in several capacities <,>
with the UNESCO <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#12:1:A>
Uh today <,,> <w> he'll </w> dwell on the principal influences <.>
a </.> acting on journalism <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#13:1:A>
Uh diplomacy in diplomatic actions <,,> and the polarisating within
the media itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#14:1:A>
Mr Padgaonkar <,,> apart from the technological advancements in
what way does present day journalism differ from that in the immediate post
independence <,> period <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#15:1:B>
There have been differences I think at three levels <&>
clearing his throat </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#16:1:B>
The first is that <,> the market for <,> the built medium has
become very much more competitive than it was in the years immediately after
Independence

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#17:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#18:1:B>
And this <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> brought into its
wake <O> coughs </O> <,> several trends some encouraging some not so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#19:1:B>
Among encouraging trends I think is the <,> much greater <,>
emphasis on the professionalism <,> on presentation on packaging so on so
forth <&> clears his throat </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#20:1:B>
The discouraging trend is of course that <,> the very competition
has given rise <,> to a great deal of uh <,> <O> one word </O> <,> journalism
sensationlism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#21:1:B>
And I refer in particular to film journalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#22:1:B>
Though it is not restricted merely to film journalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#23:1:B>
You find much of <,> uh this kind of personality bashing <,> even
in poliltical journalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#24:1:B>
And lately imperative journalism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#25:1:B>
So this is the the first <,> uh change that I I can see

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#26:1:B>
The other change has been brought about by technology itself

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#27:1:B>
I think the <,> uh revolution has been witnessed in the field of
<,,> uh print technology in particular

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#28:1:B>
The question of gathering data storing it retrieving it processing
it and so on has made uh it possible for news papers <,> now to have a
cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there <+> are
</+> teething problem <,> as everywhere else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#29:1:B>
But this is the second factor <,> which has <,> uh gone long way I
think to bring about several changes <,> in journalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#30:1:B>
Thirdly <,> <&> clears his throat </&> it has uh <,,> also brought
into play <,> a degree of specialisation which you did not have <,> in the
immediate <,> uh uhm years after independence

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#31:1:B>
Today you have uh <,> journals specialised in <,> sports in
motoring in yatching <,> uh in architecture and so on so forth

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#32:1:B>
And what this <-> is </-> meant that is <,> a greater degree of <,>
uh pluralism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#33:1:B>
Discipline-wise <,> <{> <[> uh <,> in the <O> one word </O> fashion
and these three trends taken together is meant that <w> today's </w>
journalism <,> is uh quite unlike anything that was witnessed <,> by our
parents and our grandparents <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#34:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#35:1:A>
What about the editorial content which which is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#36:1:A>
They had this <,> identity ferver then you know but today they are
tended to <,> go towards <,> through profit oriented <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#37:1:B>
You know <w> I'm </w> not one of those who believes that what
the <,> parents and grandparents did <,> evident <}> <-> <.> flo </.> </->
<=> flows </=> </}> from idealism and what is happening today is entirely <,>
uh gripped by mercantilents <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#38:1:B>
I think mercantilents were present then <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#39:1:B>
They are present today <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#40:1:B>
Those idealisms then and there is <,> considerable idealism today

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#41:1:B>
I say this because I I deal with <,> a great many <,> uh <-> then
</-> journalists <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#42:1:B>
I take an active interest in the training of journalism <,> in my
own newspaper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#43:1:B>
And uh then I feel that atleast in the initial years <,> they
aren't corroded by <?> cynicism </?> which you find among those who <+> have
</+> been in the business for <,> ten or twelve years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#44:1:B>
Uh <,> but where you are probably right is that <,> the <,,> manner
in which market forces <,> are shaping <,> uh the field today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#45:1:B>
<w> It's </w> something which is <,> which the older generation <+>
is </+> not really accustomed to <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#46:1:B>
This is happening everywhere in all countries where you have <,>
the free market and a free press

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#47:1:B>
But <,> in our country <w> it's </w> relatively new <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#48:1:B>
The fact that <,> uh today newspaper editors <,,> are supposed to
be <,> conversant atleast with what market trends are being yet what the
trends are and the area of production <,> in the area of circulation and so
on so forth

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#49:1:B>
It means that <,> uh you cannot <,,> the pictures will have of the
editor <,> who sits in his close cabin <,> and concentrates all day and
produces his handling editorials

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#50:1:B>
That picture I think is part of the <,> myth <,,> of which is uh
<,> now dead and gone <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#51:1:A>
Uh <,,> these days <w> we've </w> seen <w> you've </w> seen uh
<,> a peculiar phenomenon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#52:1:A>
Uh industrial houses have taken a keen interest in starting a
newspaper of their own you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#53:1:A>
Uh what do you feel of it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#54:1:B>
Yes there again you know you should take a look at the major
uh <,> newspapers <,> uh in the English language

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#55:1:B>
Your <?> faculty </?> were always controlled by Industrial Houses
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#56:1:B>
But what <{> <[> happens </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#57:1:A>
<[> But you had </[> </{> something to do with journalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#58:1:A>
They were not purely Industrial Houses as such

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#59:1:B>
No

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#60:1:B>
You had certain newspapers <&> clears his throat </&> which were
<,,> those only whose own sole interest was <,> in the field of publication
of magazines and newspapers

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#61:1:B>
You see if you take a look at the <&> clears his throat </&>
<mention> Anand Bazar Patrika </mention> group in Calcutta or <mention> The
Hindu </mention> group in Madras <&> clears his throat </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#62:1:B>
You always had some of them whose sole business was this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#63:1:B>
What <w> you're </w> probably trying to <,> hint at <,> is that <,>
uh industrialists with <,,> interests in several industries are adding <,,>
newspapers to their <&> clears his throat </&> <,> uh to their table sources

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#64:1:B>
Uh and then your coyright

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#65:1:B>
<-> With </-> there are two reasons for it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#66:1:B>
It might not really <+> be </+> for money

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#67:1:B>
That is <,> I can tell you that newspapers though form of uh
profitable today <,> then they ever were <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#68:1:B>
Some of them atleast <,> <&> clears his throat </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#69:1:B>
<w> It's </w> still not the most profitable among the <,> business
ventures <,> uhm in the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#70:1:B>
Uh probably many of them <,> want <,> to gain political clout <,>
by starting newspapers <&> clears his throat </&> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#71:1:B>
I have my own reservations for this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#72:1:A>
So the powers can be misused you say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#73:1:B>
So the powers can be used

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#74:1:B>
But I I had my own <,> doubts about how much clout <,> a newspaper
must be really enjoying

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#75:1:B>
I mean you know <,> being addressed to by <-> the </-> your first
name by the power <,> of the woman

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#76:1:B>
If that is clouting may be this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#77:1:B>
But if you see the manner in which the official media <,> are
handled <,> my own feeling is that the shrewdest among the political lot <,>
gear up doubles for what the print media writes

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#78:1:B>
So even this business of clout write is some what exaggerated

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#79:1:A>
But then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to
<,> an industrialist recently he had to give up his <,> shares in a
particular newspaper

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#80:1:B>
Of course it does <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#81:1:B>
But much depends also on how much that particular <}> <-> industry
</-> <=> industrialist </=> </}> is able to uh <,> <}> <-> stands </-> <+>
stand </+> </}> off <,> a pressure on him

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#82:1:B>
I know another industrialist <,> who has been uh <,> facing the
wrath of government <,> for the greater part of the past <,> ten ten years

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#83:1:B>
And uh while the scoop of the particular industrialist <,> <w>
doesn't </w> have other interests anymore <&> clears his throat </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#84:1:B>
The fact is <w> he's </w> short of the great deal of grit and comes
to me <,> in in defending these matters

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#85:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> part of you know periodically <,> <w>
there're </w> fashions <,> in the in the medium and media as <w> there's </w>
fashion elsewhere

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#86:1:B>
And the current fad is that <w> let's </w> <-> me let me </-> have
a magazine let me have a daily newspaper and so on so forth

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#87:1:B>
My own view is this will <,> this too record will fade away fast
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#88:1:A>
To what do you attribute the <}> <-> <.> plori plorify plori
</.> </-> <=> proliferation </=> </}> of a glossy magazines <,> as they call
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#89:1:A>
And <,> uh the <w> they're </w> quite successful at that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#90:1:A>
Even though they are very few and less at times

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#91:1:B>
No they are successful because no editing

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#92:1:B>
I think ten percent now <,,> and on packaging <,> on presentation
use of uh <,> colour <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#93:1:B>
Uh <,> this is all a part of growing competitive environment <,>
and uh today you have a supplement on blazed paper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#94:1:B>
Uh you even have suppliments on art paper

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#95:1:B>
And I won`t be surprised if you in due course <,> you have
supplements uh with perfume in them <,> <{> <[> uhu <,> and may be even a
musical note

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#96:1:A>
<[> Uhu </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#97:1:A>
You mean to say <-> a </-> readers can be carried away by its
<{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#98:1:B>
<[> I think </[> </{> readers are in <O> one word </O>
certainly that that one little difference <,,> uh which makes it possible for
attractive packaging <,> to to get rid of this <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#99:1:B>
This is of other areas if you see what happens for <,> detergents
or soaps or <,> uh shampoos <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#100:1:B>
You see that <w> it's </w> a really aggressive form of marketing
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#101:1:B>
The advertising <,> uh the packaging <,> this is really what <,>
what sets <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#102:1:A>
So newspaper has become like any other product

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#103:1:B>
I think <,> generally <,> <}> <-> you <.> ca </.> </-> <+>
you can </+> </}> say <,> that more and more people own newspapers regard
newspapers <,> uh in terms of products <,> then in terms of the public
service <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#104:1:A>
Uh <w> that's </w> things you <.> sh </.> should change
naturally

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#105:1:B>
It is exactly

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#106:1:B>
But you know <w> it's </w> not something to be romantic <,> it has
to come sooner or later <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#107:1:B>
If you feel that people are putting in their money investing <?>
naturally </?> and so on <,> uh uhm for <,> purely idealistic <,> uh reasons
then I think <,> uh one is really <,> not up to the mark

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#108:1:B>
Increasing <w> you'll </w> find that with massive investments <,>
uh <}> <-> they </-> <+> there </+> </}> will have <+> to </+> be a closer
interaction <,> between the editorial side of a newspaper <,> and the
managing sides of newspaper

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#109:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#110:1:A>
Uh in recent times newspapers <,> some of them <,> uh major
<w> one's </w> atleast are being <O> one word </O> that <,> either belonging
to the opposition <,> or which are very pro-government

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#111:1:A>
What do you have to say?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#112:1:B>
I think the observation is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#113:1:A>
Especially in the objectivity point of view

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#114:1:B>
Yes <,,> you your observation is <,> is at once true <,> and
sad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#115:1:B>
Because I think some newspapers <,> have taken it upon themselves
<,,> to <,> play politics through journals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#116:1:B>
Like some others have sought to use newspapers for their <,>
economic or business for example <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#117:1:B>
Uh <,> the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of
polarisation <,> on the national field <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#118:1:B>
And to that extend it is inevitable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#119:1:B>
But do newspapers contribute to the polarisation I feel yes alas
they do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#120:1:B>
Whereas uh the functions of a newspapers <w> I've </w> seen are
ready to <,,> take a stand <,,> issue by issue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#121:1:B>
Partly because ideological has come between we no longer have <,>
the certainties of <,> this or that ideology

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#122:1:B>
Things are from there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#123:1:B>
And in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you
have <&> clears his throat </&> is not another ideology <,> but self interest
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#124:1:B>
And self interest <,> understood in an absolutely mundane <,>
petty vulgar <,> sort of it

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#125:1:B>
So that extend I think you are right there is a polarisation I
deplore it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#126:1:B>
Uh I try to resist <,> it

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#127:1:B>
But unless <,> the country itself becomes <,> less polarised <,>
and until the country learns to accept that <,> there is <}> <-> no </-> <+>
not </+> </}> one truth with the capital T

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#128:1:B>
But many truths which have to <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#129:1:B>
Uh it is then that you can see their involvement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#130:1:B>
And then the involvement of the of the journalists and the
newspapers

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#131:1:B>
Uh <,> I deplore the fact for example the news columns <,> are
used more and more for partisans interests <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#132:1:B>
I think <,> uh the reporters ought to be allowed to write <,>
exactly what they feel like

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#133:1:B>
And such comment as you want to make <,> should be confined to the
<{> <[> editorials </[> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#134:1:B>
<w> That's </w> a

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#135:1:A>
<[> Editorials </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#136:1:A>
But <,,> uh there has been <,,> uh as you see <,> among <,>
theorists <,> mass media theorist say that <,,> especially in a country like
in India <,> which is still in a developing stage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#137:1:A>
There <}> <-> has </-> <=> ought </=> </}> to be some agency which
takes <,> which moulds public opinion <,> or which guides people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#138:1:A>
And at times peoples might have to take the role of the opposition
<,> because <,> as you know our opposition is pretty weak in the country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#139:1:A>
But some people <w> don't </w> agree to this

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#140:1:A>
What is what is your opinion ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#141:1:B>
No no

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#142:1:B>
<-> The </-> that you see it is it is true that you know because
institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament <,> whether it is
judiciary <,> uh <,> and much of their business is now <,> readily been given
to the press <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#143:1:B>
Uh <w> it's </w> a daunting task <,> and it <w> doesn't </w>
happen in in developed countries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#144:1:B>
And once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#145:1:B>
<w> You've </w> got to be <,> promoting causes

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#146:1:B>
<w> You've </w> got be doing things <,> which earlier you <w>
didn't </w>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#147:1:B>
For example <,> even ten years ago I think <,> that the press
reported the going on in the parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#148:1:B>
Today <w> it's </w> going from the parliament are determined by
what it is the press <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#149:1:B>
And <w> it's </w> a complete switch over <,> and <w> it's </w> a
dangerous switch over <,,> because the press <,> is accountable of course <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#150:1:B>
But certainly it is not as accountable or as immediately
accountable or as determinately accountable <,> as <,> the elected
representatives of people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#151:1:B>
And to try and <,,> substitute yourself in the press <,> for them
<,> can lead to all kinds of problems <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#152:1:A>
So do you think that certain code of conduct should be <,>
the immediate code of conduct because now we have a very loose

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-050#153:1:B>
I <w> don't </w> think either a rigid code or a flexible
codes could work <,> because partly as you rightly point out there is this
polarisation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#154:1:B>
So on what basis can you have <,> uh a <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#155:1:B>
My feeling is there is <,> very little concensus <,> in the
newspaper world

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#156:1:B>
For what newspaper ought to be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#157:1:B>
Uh <,> all of us stood together when the definition bill <,> was
brought together

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#158:1:B>
We managed to beat that back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#159:1:B>
We also stood together when recently the Jammu and Kashmir
Government <,> brought a fresh bill <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#160:1:B>
But this kind of solidarity remains very fragile <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#161:1:B>
Uh otherwise there is <,> uh uh <,> clear polarisation in the
newspaper world

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#162:1:B>
And I <w> don't </w> think it dissolved very easily <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-050#163:1:B>
For a code of conduct even a flexible one you need a measure of
consensus and that consensus mind you does not exist at the moment </I>
