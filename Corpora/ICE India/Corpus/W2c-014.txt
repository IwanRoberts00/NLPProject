<h> BOMBAY STOCK EXCHANGE </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#2:1>
<h> Restrictive role </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#3:1>
After several months of speculations, a definite proposal was
submitted last month by the governing board of the Bombay Stock Exchange (
BSE) on the subject of admitting financial institutions, their subsidiaries
as well as the subsidiaries of State Bank of India and the nationalised banks
on the stock exchange.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#4:1>
The proposal contained in the form of a report, has set out certain
conditions on the operations of the institutional members. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#5:1>
The report which is fairly comprehensive, places restrictions
on organisations that can qualify as members of the BSE.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#6:1>
It seeks to grant membership only to subsidiaries of public
financial institutions and states that they will be engaged only in
activities that other member brokers are permitted.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#7:1>
The reason <+> <?> is </?> </+> to avoid a conflict of interest
between the lending business of the financial institutions and the stock
broking business. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#8:1>
Every institution and bank can only have one subsidiary throughout
the country that can become a member of the stock exchange, states the
report.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#9:1>
The BSE proposes to allow stockbroking subsidiaries, lend multiple
membership of stock exchanges.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#10:1>
The report has made it conditional for the holding company to
provide an unconditional guarantee for an unlimited amount that relates to
the dues of the stockbroking subsidiary.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#11:1>
Stockbroking subsidiaries, the report states, <X> <quote> " should
not provide loans or other credit facilities to their customers or make any
payment to clients at a discount.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#X12:1>
In other words, banking business should not be undertaken by the
stockbroking subsidiary." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#13:1>
<bold> Restrictive role. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#14:1>
Comments Harish Bhasin, president, Delhi Stock Exchange which was the
first to admit financial institutions as members of the DSE a year ago,
<X> <quote> " I would term the restrictions as being broadly fair.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#X15:1>
But the basic difference is we ( DSE) admitted institutions and bank
subsidiaries as ordinary members - - without any special conditions."
</quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#16:1>
According to him, the institutions being under the watchful eye of
the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) are not free to operate.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#17:1>
<X> <quote> " As we have seen, the institutions play a restrictive
role now that the Bombay Stock Exchange has a new set of conditions."
</quote> </X> </p> <call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#18:1>
An institution can have only one subsidiary as a stock exchange
member.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#19:1>
But the BSE proposes to allow stockbroking subsidiaries lend multiple
membership of exchanges </call-out>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#20:1>
It is not hard to see why the committee constituted by the BSE
governing board has taken a restrictive view on institutional membership.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#21:1>
As the report observes, such an entry by the stockbroking
subsidiary would result in a large number of workers losing the existing and
future benefits.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#22:1>
<X> <quote> " Hence, initially restrictions on the quantum of
business to be done by stockbroking subsidiaries are required, to protect the
business of numerous brokers all over the country." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#23:1>
The <w> DSE's </w> view is that the entry of institutional
members will only expand, the stockbroking business.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#24:1>
It will indicate how serious the government is about opening up what
has essentially remained a closed club for several decades. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#32:2>
Stockmarkets continued to fall sharply for the second successive
fortnight on declining volumes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#33:2>
The deteriorating political situation in Kashmir was widely
attributed to be the reason, although its stabilisation did not help
markets recover in the second half of the fortnight.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#34:2>
New worries surfaced, particularly regarding the ongoing role of
UTI in the capital markets about which there is, at present, considerable
confusion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#35:2>
Meanwhile, the market - - thanks to sharp price falls on low
volumes - - is yet to become heavily oversold.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#36:2>
The rise in markets through December took place on the turnover
averaging around Rs. 100 <indig> crore </indig> per day.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#37:2>
The fall in markets since January has, however, occurred on the
turnover averaging at around 30 per cent less.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#38:2>
This means that speculators who started purchasing in December
still hold about 30 per cent of their forward buying ( long) positions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#39:2>
They are, therefore, unlikely to turn bullish ( in the normal course
of events) until the budget is over. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#40:2>
<bold> Volatile market. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#41:2>
This is a relatively new situation for the market and has arisen from
the reduced role of financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#42:2>
In the past, institutions mopped up shares after price peaks and
continued their buying when prices fell ( as part of their role in <quote> "
stabilising" </quote> markets).

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#43:2>
This allowed bulls-turned-bears to quickly dump their forward
positions on to institutions at a profit and join the bear brigade.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#44:2>
However, the recent inactivity of the Unit Trust has meant that the
old rule of <quote> " sharp rises but gentle falls" </quote> is no longer
valid.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#45:2>
The market is now likely to be volatile in both directions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#46:2>
The buying speculation in December had centered on shares with
strong fundamentals.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#47:2>
With the general decline in the market since January, bull
speculators tended to book profits first and take losses later.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#48:2>
Hence, the sharpest falls occurred in shares which had risen strongly
in December.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#49:2>
These included pharmaceutical shares which have, therefore, been the
focus of considerable speculative disinvestment over the fortnight in
spite of good expected performance. <call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#50:2>
Institutions must try to maximise the <w> investors' </w> returns and
it should be irrelevant whether they sell shares or not </call-out>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#51:2>
Hoechst fell over the fortnight from Rs. 1,840 to Rs. 1,530 ( down 17
per cent), while Glaxo fell from Rs. 108 to Rs. 93.50) ( down 13 per cent)
and Hindustan Ciba fell from Rs. 1,250 to Rs. 1,110 ( down 11 per cent). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#52:2>
The trading restrictions imposed on market leaders ( including a
ban on short sales of Tisco in both Calcutta and Bombay and Telco, among
other shares) also adversely affected share prices in the <quote> 'B'
</quote> group.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#53:2>
Since most of the <quote> 'B' </quote> group scrips have lower equity
bases, there may have been increased price volatility on account of
speculative selling.

<p> <bold> Decline in value. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#54:2>
What has affected the market the most has been the fall in the prices
of shares belonging to the Reliance and Abhey Oswal group ( see table).

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#55:2>
The market value of the shares of just these two groups has fallen by
over Rs. 2,000 <indig> crore </indig> ( or about 4 per cent of market
capitalisation) since October.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#56:2>
This fall makes up over one-third of the total decline in market
values of Rs. 6,000 <indig> crore </indig> since October.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#57:2>
Of course, any investor, who took possession of such shares just
before the elections was taking a political gamble ( which did not pay off)
and should have been fully aware of the risks.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#58:2>
But there are probably several hundreds of thousands who invested in
these companies from their inception and who have been watching the price
movements and the consequent decline in the values of their portfolios
with dismay. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#59:2>
They, along with many other investors, are probably hoping for a
<w> UTI's </w> return to the capital markets as a major buyer.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#60:2>
This would be a mistake if it is so.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#61:2>
Like the ones before him, the finance minister favours a <quote> "
stabilising" </quote> role for financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#62:2>
In the past, however, institutions have been able to absorb falls
though not entirely stop them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#63:2>
The price they have paid for gentler falls is that they are now
overloaded with shares of scrips like Reliance whose price they tried to
stabilise ( which made sense at the time given the prominence of Reliance
shares on the BSE Sensitive Index). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#64:2>
The ideal role for institutions is to try and maximise the
returns of investors in their various schemes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#65:2>
Since the UTI is always a net acquirer of funds from the
public, it should be irrelevant whether it sometimes sells shares or not.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#66:2>
And there are enough shares of good investment quality available at
any point of time for purchase.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#67:2>
In other words, financial institutions should not be asked to
consider market stabilisation as a policy goal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#68:2>
By following the simple rule of value maximisation, the
institutions will automatically help stabilise markets. </p>

<h> AMUSEMENT PARKS </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#71:3>
<h> First off, after some hiccups </h> <O> photograph </O> <O>
caption </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#72:3>
After months of controversy, Esselworld, the <w> country's </w>
first amusement park at Gorai in north Bombay, was formally inaugurated on
Christmas eve 1989 by the Maharashtra chief minister, Sharad Pawar, whose
administration had been accused, by his political opponents of irregularly
granting the various permissions for the project.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#73:3>
Sharing the dais with Pawar was Ram Naik, the BJP MP from north
Bombay who had earlier vehemently opposed the project on the ground that it
would add to vehicular congestion and strain the public utilities in the
area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#74:3>
The park had earlier been informally opened to the employees and
shareholders of Essel Packaging, of which <w> Essel's </w> Amusement
Parks ( India) Ltd is a subsidiary, and to annual passport holders of
Esselworld on 14 November, the birth centenary of Jawaharlal Nehru.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#75:3>
Eighty per cent of the first phase has now been completed with 30-odd
rides having been installed at a cost of around Rs. 20.5 <indig> crore
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#76:3>
The park has a regular flow of nearly 3.500 people on week days,
which swells to around 10,000 on Sundays and holidays, according to an
Esselworld spokesman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#77:3>
<bold> Land development. </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#78:3>
The park is situated on a 64 acre plot of land which is part of a 689
acre plot acquired by the company at a court auction in 1982.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#79:3>
However, pending settlement of a dispute with the state government
over ownership of the land, the company was allowed to develop only 64 acres
( <it> Business India </it> , April 17-30, 1989).

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#80:3>
It has since got an <foreign> <it> ad interim </it> </foreign> order
from the Bombay High Court in May last year, permitting it to develop the
rest of the land. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#81:3>
The company has effectively laid to rest the anxiety of local
politicians, environmentalists and administrative officials of the state
government and the Bombay Municipal Corporation ( BMC), regarding
congestion and the adverse effects, the park would have on the environment.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#82:3>
The park will use water from the ten bore wells on the premises,
which has so far been adequate to meet the requirements of the park.
#@*@ To ease traffic congestion the company has undertaken to build parking
lots at Borivili and Gorai jetties, two approach points, at a cost of around
Rs. 10 <indig> lakh </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#83:3>
These will be handed over to the Bombay Municipal Corporation ( BMC)
to be run as pay-and-park lots after they are built.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#84:3>
Moreover, the park has its own parking lot for around 2,000 cars
outside the entrance.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#85:3>
Visitors coming to the park by road will have to use the
comparatively uncongested route via Bhayander, a suburb, north of the
city. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#86:3>
The company plies mini buses from the suburbs of Borivili and
Malad to carry visitors to the park free of cost.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#87:3>
Soon a sister concern, Empire Holdings, will operate a ferry service
across an adjacent creek, thus easing the burden on the existing ferry
service.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#88:3>
The ferry boats, being built in Goa, are flat-bottomed ones that will
be able to ply even during low tide so that passengers will not be stranded
when the tide is too low for the existing boats to operate. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-014#89:3>
The additional commissioner of police ( traffic), P.S. Pasricha,
had earlier granted the park permission to remain open only till 5 pm for
fear of congestion.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#90:3>
However, after seeing the traffic arrangements made, he has now
allowed it to operate till 8 pm.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#91:3>
Says a company spokesman, <X> <quote> " Now we have received all the
permissions, the last one to come in being the BMC commencement certificate.

<ICE-IND:W2C-014#X92:3>
We can now go ahead unhindered, though after a delay of seven
months due to the controversy." </quote> </X> </p>
