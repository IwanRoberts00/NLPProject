<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#1:1:A>
Uhm <,,> Mr Yadav <,,> you told something about your native
place <indig> na </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#2:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#3:1:A>
Which is your native place <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#4:1:B>
Native Place is uh <,,> U P <,,> Azamgarh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#5:1:A>
Oh I see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#6:1:A>
So <,,> when did you finish your M A degree <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#7:1:B>
In fact I finished my <,> M A some uh <,,> from the University
of Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#8:1:A>
Uhm <,> I see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#9:1:A>
That means uh you finished it <,,> in the university itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#10:1:A>
Which year <,> could you tell me the year <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#11:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#12:1:B>
Right <,> in nineteen <,> eighty-seven <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#13:1:A>
After that <,> what have you been doing <,> since then <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#14:1:B>
Infact after uh <,,> in uh nineteen eighty-seven <,> almost uh
<,> in July <,> I got my degree <,> M A degree

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#15:1:B>
And uh after that <,,> I taught in a college almost for four year
uh four months <{> <[> and </[> uh <,> of course <,> and uh after that <,,>
since it was a private college <,> and uh <,> I didn't hope much <,,> from
this college <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#16:1:B>
And meanwhile <,> fortunately <,> I got a job <,> in state
government school <,,> and uh I <,,> took up this job <,> now <w> I'm </w>
going on with this job <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#17:1:A>
<[> Oh is that </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#18:1:A>
Uh <,,> uh are you happy with this present job <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#19:1:B>
<w> It's </w> all it <O> laughs </O> <,,> to a certain extent
<,> uh <w> I'm </w> happy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#20:1:B>
But since <w> it's </w> a very interior part of uh <,> Jabalpur
city <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#21:1:B>
So sometimes I don't find <,> uhm <,> me at ease <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#22:1:B>
Eh in the in the sense <,,> it was uh <,> high <w> I'm </w>
appointed there <,> as a English teacher <,,> uh but things are quite
different there

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#23:1:B>
I don't find people <,> who can uh <,> speak <,,> with me in
English <,> <{> <[> ah <,> or even whenever I teach in in the classes <,,> uh
I quiet often I used by mother tongue <,> Hindi

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#24:1:B>
So <,> from uh <,,> my part <,,> I like something <,,> <{> <[> that
uh </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#25:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#26:1:A>
<[> It means uh </[> </{> <,> since you do not get the
opportunity to use English outside the classroom <,> or even inside the
classroom <,> you are not fully satisfied with the present <{> <[> Job </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#27:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{> yeah well <w> I'm </w> not uh fully satisfied
<,> because in fact <,,> uh English is a second language for me <,> and <,>
uh unless uh we <,,> uh take up or continue <,> with the <,> uhm <,,> unless
we follow the uhm four available skills <,,> of learning second language <,>
then I don't think it will be better for a learner <,,> to <,,> develop or uh
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#28:1:A>
Okay I understand that

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#29:1:A>
Now <,> since you are doing the P G C T now <,> after going back
<,> is it possible for you to use simple English <,,> in the classroom itself
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#30:1:B>
Yeah I would like to <,,> uhm use <,,> simple English <,,> as
much as uh <,> possible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#31:1:B>
Since uh <,> student there <,,> where I teach <,,> <w> they're </w>
not able to understand uh <,> even simple sentences <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#32:1:B>
But even then I would like to do <,,> uhm my best <,> particularly
I would like to use <,> English sentences simple sentences

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#33:1:B>
So that uh <,> they can uh make an effort <,> to <,> understand the
sentences <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#34:1:A>
Yeah <w> that's </w> what I also feel better <,> because <,>
to to begin with you can use simple English <,> simple sentences

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#35:1:A>
And uh <,> after one month or so on <,> after one month or so <,>
you can increase the standard <,,> step by step <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#36:1:A>
And I think <w> you'll </w> be successful in using English inside
the classroom also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#37:1:A>
And when you meet some friends <,,> when you go here and there to
different places <,> you can use uh English <,,> and so I think <,> uh you
can improve a lot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#38:1:A>
Then <w> what's </w> your future plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#39:1:A>
That is uh to continue the school or to search for another job <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#40:1:B>
Well uhm infact <,,> uh I need a lot of improvement <,>
particularly in my <,> spoken English <,> and uh <,,> particularly
pronunciation <,> stress intonation <,> and uh <,,> <w> there're </w> uh
other fields of English <,> there I find myself uh <,,> uhm <,,> but I
realise that uh I lack something <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#41:1:B>
So my next plan would be <,,> eh to take up Diploma course <,> from
C I E F L Hyderabad

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#42:1:B>
And <,> I wish <,> I would be able to do <,> my best <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#43:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#44:1:A>
Now <,> <w> I've </w> understood uh <,,> much from you <,> <w> I've
</w> understood your carrer and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#45:1:A>
But so far <w> I've </w> not informed to you anything about me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#46:1:A>
Uhm well you as you know my name is Chandrashekhar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#47:1:A>
And actually I belong to <,,> the south India <,,> Tamil Nadu <,,>
Kanyakumari district <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#48:1:A>
And presently <w> I'm </w> teaching in st <w> Joseph's </w> College
<,,> Chakama <,> Kohima <,> Nagaland <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#49:1:A>
Teaching in a college where there is P U degree <,> pre degree <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#50:1:A>
Then B A also is there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#51:1:A>
B A <,> two year plus one year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#52:1:A>
B A pass course <,> and B A honours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#53:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> teaching there for all the three <,> year students
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#54:1:A>
And <w> I'm </w> <,> happy with my job <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#55:1:A>
Uhm salary is okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#56:1:A>
Then the people <,> the students are also <,> well co-operative
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#57:1:A>
Then <,> my wife is also working in the college

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#58:1:A>
So everything is quite okay with me <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#59:1:A>
Uh if you want to know something more about me <,> you are free to
ask <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#60:1:B>
Uh when did you <,> get <,> this job <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#61:1:A>
I got this job <,> in nineteen eighty-six

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#62:1:B>
Nineteen nineteen eighty-six <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#63:1:B>
And uh when did you finish your <,> post graduate

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#64:1:A>
My post graduation degree I finished it in <,,> uh mid June
nineteen eighty-six

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#65:1:B>
June nineteen <{> <[> eighty-six </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#66:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#67:1:A>
And immediately after that in July nineteen eighty-six I joined the
post

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#68:1:B>
Yeah <,> all right

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#69:1:B>
Uh in fact <,> since <w> you're </w> also doing your <,> uh post
graduation certificate in teaching English <,> uh after I hope <,,> as you
are doing well and <O> laughs </O> <,,> and uh you are supposed to <,,> get
good grade <,> as well <,> in the what would be your next step <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#70:1:B>
Are you going to take up your Diploma course

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#71:1:B>
Or uh if you get suppose if you get <,> uh uh A grade or A plus <,>
then <,,> uh would you like to take up your <,,> M Litt

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#72:1:A>
Certainly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#73:1:B>
Master of Litt

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#74:1:A>
Yeah certainly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#75:1:A>
I my ambition is this one <,> to do my <,> Diploma <,,> and
complete my M Litt <,,> then if possible M Phil also <,,> so that I can cover
the literature <,> side also <,> English literature <,> then <,> at last do
my Ph D <,> <w> it's </w> my aim <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#76:1:A>
But I think <,> things will go on well <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#77:1:B>
Shall I <?> take </?> your <,> opinion about your <,,>
academic career <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#78:1:B>
Uh you talk <,,> talk about your <,> M Phil <,> and Diploma as well
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#79:1:B>
But I don't think <,,> <w> it's </w> my own opinion <,,> uh once
you have degree <,,> of uh Diploma in the teaching of English from C I E F L
Hyderabad <,> and most of the universities of our country <,,> uh have uh
accepted this Diploma <,,> equivalent to <,,> M Phil degree <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#80:1:B>
Then I don't think <,> it would better for you <,,> to do again <,>
your M Phil <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#81:1:B>
And it would be better to do <,> your M Litt <,> after your Diploma
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#82:1:A>
Yeah <,,> what <w> you've </w> said is correct

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#83:1:A>
But <,,> uh after doing M Phil uh Diploma <,> I directly wanted to
<,> do <,,> my M Litt course <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#84:1:A>
And then if possible <,> <w> I'll </w> cover up <,> in order to
cover up the literature area also <,> I feel like doing M Phil if possible
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#85:1:B>
Suppose if <,> uh you finish your M Litt <,> I think <w> it's
</w> your ambition <,,> and is a desire <,> as well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#86:1:B>
And then <,,> uh would you like to think something <,,> uh about
your Ph D <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#87:1:B>
Quite often we find people interested uh in doing Ph D <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#88:1:B>
Uhm somewhere even some <,> from the from some universities

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#89:1:B>
But uh doing Ph D from <,> C I E F L Hyderabad <,,> is not an easy
task <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#90:1:B>
Because uh we are supposed to <,> perform well there <,> only then
Ph D degree <,> is awarded there

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#91:1:B>
So <,,> uh what is your next plan

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#92:1:B>
What about your next plan in future to do your Ph D from C I E F L
Hyderabad or some <,> uh other universities of our country <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#93:1:A>
It is yet <,,> uhm uhm very interesting question that you have
asked me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#94:1:A>
Actually it is not an easy task <,> to do our Ph D from C I E <,>
especially in E L T <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#95:1:A>
But <,> before that <,> I want to give extra reading <,> to improve
myself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#96:1:A>
So that I can <,> when I finish my Diploma <,> M Litt and M Phil
<,> with wider reading <,> I think <w> I'll </w> be able to <,,> uh complete
my Ph D <,,> very well <,> in a satisfactory way <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#97:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#98:1:A>
You have told me all about yourself

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#99:1:A>
Now <,> could you tell me something about your family background
<,> your parents and how many children are there in the family and so on <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#100:1:B>
Right <,,> I infact my family is <.> cons </.> <,> consist of
<,> uh six seven members <,> seven members <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#101:1:B>

sisters <,,> and <w> I've </w> a wife <,,> and <w> I've </w> a son as well

<,> retire <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#104:1:B>
And uh <,,> as far as uh my question is concerned <,> <w> I'm </w>
the man <,,> uhm <,,> yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#105:1:A>
Are you the eldest in the family <,,>

Yeah <,> no my <,,> one of my sister <,,> is the youngest
<,,> <w> I'm </w> sorry eldest <,> and uh <w> I'm </w> the next to her <,,>

Naughty boy <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#133:1:A>
Yeah very clever

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#134:1:B>
He has got after you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#135:1:A>
Say like this <,> quiet naughty boy <,,> <O> cough </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#136:1:B>
Yeah children are supposed to be naughty <,,> at the
beginning

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#137:1:A>
Hope it is <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#138:1:A>
But he is very clever so <,> everything is well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#139:1:A>
And <,,> uh I like the family <,,> <w> I'm </w> a happy man so to
so to say <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#140:1:B>
That is the matter <,,> uh for you <,,> its good that you
have <,,> uh a wife and a son <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#141:1:B>
You must be very <,> happy man <,> having a wife <,,> who is
working <,> with you in the same college <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#142:1:B>
And uh <,,> don't you think <,,> uh whenever you work in the same
college you find some sort of uh <,,> uhm problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#143:1:B>
Problem I mean <,,> uh working in a same college <,,> in same in
the same <.> de </.> department <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#144:1:B>
Don't you find uh some sort of trouble <,> or some sort of <.>
cont </.> <,> <{> <[> or controversy </[> as such

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#145:1:A>
<[> You see uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#146:1:A>
There is no trouble or problem as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#147:1:A>
But the only problem with us is <,,> getting leave <,,> from <,,>
the principal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#148:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the only problem <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#149:1:A>
When she wants to do any course or anything <,,> she can't <,> get
leave

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#150:1:A>
And when I want to do anything I also <,> <w> I'm </w> not free to
get leave <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#151:1:A>
This is the only problem we face <,> when we work together in the
same college <,,> and nothing else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#152:1:A>
The other things are okay because <,> <w> we're </w> working in
the same place <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#153:1:A>
And we have the opportunity of being together always <,,> and it
is something interesting <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#154:1:B>
A few days <,,> infact I would like to take you to <,,> uhm I
would like to take you <,> in this politics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#155:1:B>
And uh I think uh you <,> you must be familiar <,,> uh with the
conditions going on that our country is facing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#156:1:B>
Uhm political disasters <,> and uh disorders <,> and election has
taken place <,,> a few <,,> weeks earlier <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#157:1:B>
And uh <,,> what shall would be your opinion <,,> and that <,> no
party again <,,> has come into power

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#158:1:B>
And I think <,> uh uh in your opinion <,,> as far as my opinion is
concerned <,,> I would like to uh uh I want uh if <,> India needs uh <?>
British </?> rule <,> or uh <,> next alternative <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#159:1:B>
What would be the next alternative would you like to suggest <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#160:1:A>
But uh <,> <&> clearing the throat </&> what has happened
this year <,> is really <,> a political disaster <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#161:1:A>
But even then I still have faith in democracy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#162:1:A>
But <,> all the political systems <.> ha </.> have their own
defects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#163:1:A>
Even then <,,> I believe in democracy <,,> and uh <,> India needs
a better leader <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#164:1:A>
One who can do <,,> and <,> one who can do well for the people
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#165:1:A>
Now we have been talking about everything <,,> since you belong to
<,,> since you belong to M P <,> could you tell me something about your state
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-009#166:1:B>
<w> It's </w> alright infact I <,,> went to Jabalpur <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#167:1:B>
A well known city of uh M P state <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#168:1:B>
I went there in nineteen eighty-five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#169:1:B>
I uh before <,,> uh I had uh no sort of any idea about <,> uh M P
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#170:1:B>
And uh <,,> but there I found people <,> particularly in <,> the
field of <.> pol </.> politics <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#171:1:B>
There <,> politics is based on some sort of principles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#172:1:B>
And uh leaders are supposed to do <,,> some work concrete work
<,,> uh for the public <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#173:1:B>
And infact <,> uh same people <,,> sometime <,,> they favour uh
<,> <mention> Congress-I </mention> and sometime they favour <,,> <mention>
<indig> Bharatiya Janata </indig> Party </mention> but <w> they're </w> but
infact there <,> uh politics is based there <,> uh on uh some sort of
principles <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-009#174:1:B>
They are not going to <,,> show the same beaten track <,> like uh
<,,> other states U P Bihar where <,> politics is totally based on <,,> uhm
casteism <,,> </I>
