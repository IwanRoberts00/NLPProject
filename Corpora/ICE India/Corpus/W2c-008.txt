<ICE-IND:W2C-008#4:1>
<it> It is just impossible to kill for good any thing that is even
remotely connected to fun in Goa and this, is evident from the fact that the
Carnival which was discontinued for a brief spell in 1987 due to public
opposition is now gaining momentum once again, though very cautiously.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#5:1>
There are many theories as to the origins of Carnival and why it
is celebrated but, in Goa, I think it just caught on because <quote> " it is
fun." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#6:1>
Over the years, however, the fun started to degenerate into
vulgarity thanks largely to the government who openly encouraged our women to
dress scantily and dance on the streets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#7:1>
Confronted with this accusation the government denied the
allegations, but the fact <-> accusation, the government denied the
allegations, but the fact </-> remains that the Department of Tourism
funded street floats and advertised extensively in national dailies to
attract domestic tourists to the state. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#8:1>
The fun degenerated further - - alcohol was used and abused in
unlimited quantities and some time later even drugs found their way in.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#9:1>
For that matter, at one stage a serious allegation was levelled by
a social organisation that more abortions were performed in Goa soon after
Carnival than any other period of the year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#10:1>
In the face of these allegations and the virtual highjacking of
the celebrations by some of the big companies who used the occasion to
further their interests by sponsoring floats, the public decided that
enough is enough. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#11:1>
Some very socially and morally concerned groups like the Jagrut
Goemkaracho Fauz and the Bailancho Saad decided that the Carnival must
stop if our young boys and girls had to be saved and thus following an
agitation in 1987 there was no Carnival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#12:1>
But then the good Goan decided that all good things ( or bad)
generally associated with fun, must not come to an end, hence in 1988 the
entertainment king of Goa Francisco Martins popularly known as Fanquito,
decided to revive the Carnival in a novel manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#13:1>
Mr Martins with the help of any one who was interested organised
a <w> people's </w> carnival led by a float comprising of small children
followed by adults in any vehicle that was available to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#14:1>
Subsequently, the following year, Armando Gonsalves and some of
his friends decided to <}> <-> organised </-> <+> organise </+> </}> a junk
car rally after sun down in the city which, incidentally, became an
instant success. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#15:1>
The traditional dances on the three days of carnival, however
were held, but the mood was low. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#16:1>
And now, in 1990, during the third year of its revival, the
carnival is slowly, but cautiously gaining momentum and will be celebrated on
a much larger scale starting at 5 pm of February 24. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#17:1>
Organised by Show Biz, the floats this year promise to be unique
in the sense that there will not be just one King Momo. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#18:1>
Any one who wishes to be King Momo can enter <}> <-> they </->
<+> the </+> </}> fray along with his float and the most imaginative group
will be awarded a cash prize of Rs 5,000. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#19:1>
The agenda for the 24th evening is vast and, it seems that it is
just one more step in the direction of fully reviving the carnival, but the
organisers promise never to let it go back to be what it was before 1987.

<h> <w> It's </w> Here Once Again </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#21:2>
<bold> By <@AS> Rajan Narayan {#} </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#22:2>
The Government sponsored Carnival died three years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#23:2>
It was buried following popular protests against the
commercialisation and increasing vulgarity which had crept into the
Government sponsored Carnival.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#24:2>
And out of the ashes of the government sponsored Carnival, the <w>
People's </w> <foreign> Carnaval </foreign> was born. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#25:2>
The first <w> people's </w> <foreign> carnaval </foreign> took
place under the shadow of the discontent and dissatisfaction of several
Goenkars about the content of the official language bill which had just
been passed.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#26:2>
Some of those who took part in the battle for making Konkani the
exclusive official language of the State of Goa, were not happy with the
official language bill.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#27:2>
They had called for a boycott of the <foreign> carnaval </foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#28:2>
But a few courageous Goenkars decided to defy the boycott.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#29:2>
They decided to revive the spirit of good old <foreign> carnaval
</foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#30:2>
There were hardly a couple of floats.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#31:2>
But there were no advertisements from commercial organisation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#32:2>
There were no Bamboo fences separating the participants from the
audience.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#33:2>
And I recall that though the Travel and Tourism club had decided not
to risk its neck, two members of the club Mr Babu Keni of the Mandovi Hotel
and Mr Sunil Naik of the Samrat Hotel defied the club and participated in
the <foreign> carnaval with their families. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#34:2>
It was a <}> <-> symbollic </-> <+> symbolic </+> </}> beginning.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#35:2>
Marking the revival of the spirit of the <foreign> carnaval
</foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#36:2>
The good old <foreign> carnaval </foreign> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#37:2>
And the next year the <foreign> carnaval </foreign> was transformed
into a junk car rally.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#38:2>
Without floats <*> dotted-line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#39:2>
But with music.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#40:2>
And with cars and motorcycles and scooters all dressed up of
various vintages in all shapes and sizes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#41:2>
And last year, the Junk car rally remained.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#42:2>
But in addition there were a few floats.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#43:2>
Mercifully they were no commercial floats.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#44:2>
And the government kept out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#45:2>
And bamboo barriers were not erected.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#46:2>
And there was a greater sense of participation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#47:2>
And a good time was had by one and all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#48:2>
Happy days are here again.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#49:2>
<foreign> Carnaval </foreign> times are here again.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#50:2>
And this year <w> there'll </w> be the usual junk car rally.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#51:2>
And there will be a King Momo contest.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#52:2>
<}> <-> and </-> <+> And </+> </}> there will be floats which will
explore the natural beauty of Goa.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#53:2>
Which I hope and pray will not include the <foreign> tavernas
</foreign> and nude hippies on the beaches of Goa.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#54:2>
Though there may be some argue that <indig> feni </indig> and nudism
are now part of the heritage of Golden Goa. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#55:2>
Happy day are again.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#56:2>
<foreign> Carnaval </foreign> times are here again.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#57:2>
A time to let you hair down.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#58:2>
A time to let yourself go.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#59:2>
But for <w> heaven's </w> sake let us make sure it is good clean fun.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#60:2>
Once upon a time, some little boys were throwing stones at some
frogs in a pond.

SMOKING is back in fashion, as if in a backlash to the
health-conscious past.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#65:3>
Foreign advertisements for clothes, perfume and even department
stores include leggy models languorously drawing on cigarettes.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#66:3>
Advertisers claim their intention is not to make smoking
fashionable but <quote> " to give an image that is relaxed and casual."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#67:3>
Despite medical evidence that it messes up hormones, causes
cancer and coronary heart disease and eventually kills - - smoking continues
to be imbued with sex appeal, sophistication and even adventure.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#68:3>
The <quote> 'cool' </quote> image of models smoking is in direct
contrast to the issue of health-racking cough, bad breath and disease.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#84:4>
<bold> Maganlal and Sons have been making <indig> chikki </indig> for
almost hundred years </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#85:4>
FOR anyone travelling on the Bombay-Pune road a halt at the
Maganlal and <w> Sons' </w> shop in Lonavala is a must.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#86:4>
The shop is synonymous with the place and is famous for <indig>
chikki </indig> - the fame of which has reached far-and-wide.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#87:4>
Hardly anyone ever drives past without stopping to buy a packet of
<indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig> - - for self, family or friends. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#88:4>
The success story of Maganlal and Sons dates back to 1882.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#89:4>
Bhivraj Agarwal, accompanied by his 16-year-old son, Maganlal, left
his ancestral home near Agra, in search of business opportunities.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#90:4>
In those days, the <indig> ghat </indig> railway line from Karjat
to Khandala, was under construction and thousands of labourers toiled the
whole day.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#91:4>
This provided a golden opportunity for Bhivraj to start some kind
of business.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#92:4>
He began preparing <indig> <it> gurdani </it> </indig> - - sweet made
from jaggery and groundnuts of <indig> <it> kurmura </it> </indig> (
puffed rice) and sold it to the workers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#93:4>
Inexpensive and filling this sweet became and instant hit. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#94:4>
<w> Bhivraj's </w> efforts paid off.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#95:4>
This was the beginning of his <indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig>
business.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#96:4>
He marketed the <indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig> under the trade
name of Maganlal, after his son expired in 1930.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#97:4>
Then, his son Ambalal took over the business but with his death in
1968, Mohanlal took charge.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#98:4>
He involved his sons as well as the sons of Ambalal.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#99:4>
After the demise of Mohanlal a couple of months ago,
Chandraprakash, Pralhad, Suresh, Bharat and Dhruva have taken over the reins
of the family enterprise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#100:4>
Informs Dhruva, <quote> " The <indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig>
acquired a neat package and was sold at Lonavala railway station from
1940. <+> <?> " </+> </?> </quote> <

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#101:4>
The salubrious weather year-round and vantage position on railways
and highways ( the shop is located opposite the station) have increased
profits.

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#102:4>
The large Parsi population as also of Christians and Anglo-Indians,
popularised the <indig> chikki </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-008#103:4>
It is today a hot favourite of tourists. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#104:4>
The shop received a facelift in 1982, when the pioneers
celebrated the centenary of their <indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig>
business, which was further streamlined to facilitate diversification.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-008#105:4>
The spruced up sales-counter is lined up with a variety of
<indig> <it> chikki </it> </indig> - - groundnut, coconut, puffed rice,
cashew nuts, almonds and others.
