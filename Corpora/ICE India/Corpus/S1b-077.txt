<ICE-IND:S1B-077#1:1:A>
So <,,> the last meeting <,,> which perhaps was the first <,,>
special meeting <,,> requisition <,,> was held on nineteenth April nineteen
ninety-four <,,> at three pm in the physics auditorium <,,> to discuss <,,>
non issuance of <,,> convocation invitations to non <O> one word </O>
teachers <,,> of this <,> University <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#2:1:A>
In the meeting <,,> after <,,> the relevant documents were presented
<,,> and <,> after much of discussion about the issue involved <,,> it was
resolved <,,> that in future <,,> the attempt <,> should be made by the
organisation <,,> to convene the authority <,,> that the teachers of the
University <,,> shall be issued <,,> invitations for the convocation <,,>
that is all convocations to be <,> held in future <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#3:1:A>
Now <,> that was the only item to be discussed in that meeting <,>
and that constitutes the minute <,> of the previous meeting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#4:1:A>
The meeting <,,> preceeding this special meeting <,,> was held on
fifteenth January nineteen ninety-four <,,>

In that meeting <,,> apart from the confirmation to the previous <,>
meeting <,,> minute <,,> in all <,,> twenty resolutions were passed <,,>

The seventh resolution was <,,> uh it was resolved to request the
University authorities to modify existing quarter development rule <,> on the
following lines <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#22:1:A>
And a number of rules were given <,,> such as <?> fit </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#23:1:A>
They were submitted to the university authorities <,> and after
taking due cognisance of the said rule <,> the university authorities have
passed <,> a <,> kind of an order in that respect <,> and I hope <,> uh the
concerned circular has reached <,> every department <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#24:1:A>
The next resolution was <,,> uh <,> accepting the secretaries <,,>

It may be very costly for them just for <,> uh coming here and <,,>
uh that is coming over here for voting <,> and spending <,,> uh not less than
perhaps two hundred <indig> rupees </indig> per head <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#27:1:A>

It is further resolved to convey to the authority <,,> that the
same compulsion <,,> should not be imposed in respect of other functions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#31:1:A>
Similarly in the case of date mentioned above <,> in genuine
circumstances <,> the teachers may be allowed to leave <,> allow the leave of
absence <,> by the <}> <-> <.> autho </.> </-> <=> authority </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#32:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#33:1:A>
Resolution number twelve <,> resolved to authorise <,> issue of
<mention> SUPTA </mention> <,> to invest its surplus fund <,> in a manner
being beneficial to <mention> SUPTA </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#34:1:A>
Thirteen <,,> resolved to <}> <-> protect </-> <,> <=> protest </=>

teachers quarters <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#35:1:A>

to install <,> E-mail facility <,> without curtailing present <,> library
facility <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#36:1:A>
Sixteen <,,> resolved to recommend to the university authority <,,>
to strictly fill in teachers vacancies <,> by the persons having exact
specialisations advertised for <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#37:1:A>
Seventeen <,,> noted the suggestions made by <,> members <,,>

</-> <,> <=> examination </=> </}> schedule <,> and water charges <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#38:1:A>
Eighteen <,> resolved to recommend to university authority <,,> to
ensure that <,,> whole allocations <,,> for research and development <,> for
departments are made available <,> as and when <,,> necessary <,> without any
nexus with U G C finance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#39:1:A>
Nineteen <,> resolved to make enquiries regarding L I C facilities
outside <,,> sorry that is L T C facilities outside Maharashtra <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#40:1:A>
And the last resolution was <,> resolved to write to the <,>
officer on special duty office <,> for early payment of arrears <,> and
revive <-> pay <.> fac </.> </-> uh <,,> pays <,> failing which a notice be
issued simultaneously about a <indig> dharna <,> uposhan </indig> to be
staged in front of his office in April nineteen ninety-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#41:1:A>
So these were the <,> resolutions adopted in the previous general
body meeting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#42:1:A>
And we have already <,> uh <}> <-> <.> men </.> </-> <=> mentioned
</=> </}> <,> the resolution adopted in the <,> last <,> general body meeting
that is special general body meeting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#43:1:A>
I hope the members approve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#44:1:A>
Now about <,,> the Secretaries Report <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#45:1:A>
After this report uh <,> relates to the period after <,,> the
previous general body meeting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#46:1:A>
Uh about teachers problems which are pending so far <,> <w> we'll
</w> come to that issue at a later stage <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#47:1:A>
But what has been done during <,> this intervening period <,,> I
think can be stated in a very brief manner <,> in the following words <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#48:1:A>
The President <,> the Secretary <,> and the member of the executive
council of <mention> SUPTA </mention> attended <,,> national executive
council meeting <,> of A I <O> one word </O> <,> on eighth March nineteen
ninety-four in Delhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#49:1:A>
At the same time they participated <,> in a <indig> morcha </indig>
and <indig> dharna </indig> organised by the <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#50:1:A>
Where the major demands were <,,> number one pay revision <,> that
is appointment of a panel for <,> pay revision <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#51:1:A>
Number two <,,> uh earlier demands <,> which have been pending for
a long time <,> with the U G C and the Government of <,> India regarding
inclusion of <,> uh teaching experience as demonstrators and tutors <,> in
the total length of service for placement purposes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#52:1:A>
Number three <,> promotion of Readers to Professors in the
universities <,> and uh some minor things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#53:1:A>
But these were the three important major demands <,> uh which were
presented by <,> the <O> one word </O> <indig> morcha </indig> on the
Parliament <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#54:1:A>
And I am very happy to <,,> uh report that uh <,> subsequently <,>
immediately at the same time <,> uh the minister for Human Resources
Development <,> was very generous enough to invite <,> a select uh <,,> you
know group of people representing <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#55:1:A>
They had a discussion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#56:1:A>
Subsequently the U G C Chairman also invited a larger contingent
<,> uh for discussion <,> where again most of the pending problems of the
teachers were discussed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#57:1:A>
And uh <,> as you might all be knowing <,> recently <,> uh the most
important demand <,> that is appointment of a <,> pay panel <,> uh has been
considered by <,,> the U G C <,> and <,> uh a committee for pay revision of
college and university teachers has been appointed <,> uh under the
chairmanship of <,> Professor Rastogi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#58:1:A>
Uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first <,> uh July
<,,> uh sorry August <,> demonstrations were cancelled <,> by <O> one word
</O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#59:1:A>
Subsequent to that <,,> uh of course in a very <,,> casual manner I
would say <,> I will have to <,> uh recall to you the <,,> two days <,,>
where perhaps for the first time <mention> SUPTA </mention> organised some
cultural activities after a long gap <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#60:1:A>
Uh one was that <,,> uh article show by <,,> uh Laxman Deshpande
<,,> from Marathwada <,> and another by Vishubai Bapat <,> uh <indig> kutumba
<,> rangale kavyat </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#61:1:A>
Then uh comes the mention regarding <,> the efforts made by
<mention> SUPTA </mention> with the authorities of the University <,> for
installing <,> or instituting rather <,,> a prize for <,,> a good teacher
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#62:1:A>
Every year to be awarded <,,> on the day of the University
foundation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#63:1:A>
Incidently <,> the whole affair began with <,> the announcement by
the authorities <,> that a prize of this nature will be instituted <,> for
only non-teaching employees of the university <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#64:1:A>
Not only that <,,> uh the sons and daughters and ward <,> of
non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes
for their <,> excellent performances in the <,> various examination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#65:1:A>
When that circular <,,> uh was raised by <,> some of the office
bearers of <mention> SUPTA </mention> <,,> we immediately rushed to the
university authorities <,> discussed the matter with them <,> and then
subsequently a written demand was placed <,> that the teachers are also
employees of the university <,> and they also must be considered for this
kind of treatment <,> and fortunately <,> in the subsequent executive council
meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and I
hope <,> on the first <,> uh that is coming <,> eighteenth November nineteen
ninety-four <,> first of such awards will be issued <,> uh awarded <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#66:1:A>
And uh let us hope <,> uh some of you is going to bag that award
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#67:1:A>
Then <,,> this <}> <-> <w> womens' </w> well <,> </-> <+> <w>
women's </w> cell </+> </}> <,,> committee <,> conducted two meeting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#68:1:A>
A report has been prepared by that committee <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#69:1:A>
The report will be presented to the body <,> subsequently <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#70:1:A>
Then as you all remember we organised <,> a discussion on the <,>
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#71:1:A>
We have also submitted a demand to the university authorities
regarding <,,> uh issue of <,> laminated I-cards <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#72:1:A>
Uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees <,> and
again we were <,> perhaps forgotten <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#73:1:A>
And only after we approached the authorities and uh <,,> brought it
to their notice <,> that they have agreed in principle <,> that similar
laminated I-cards will be issued <,> to the teachers also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#74:1:A>
Then <,,> we have submitted another representation to the
university authorities regarding <,,> uh some particular <,,> problems of the
<,,> Adult and Continuing Education department number one <,,> and <O> one
word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#75:1:A>
Their problems relate mainly to <,,> some <,> cofusion regarding
new facilities <,,> whether these people <,> that is <,> academic
non-vacational <,,> employees of the university <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#76:1:A>
They are entitled to <,,> some kind of earned leave <,> in lieu <,>
of the <,> period for which they work during vacation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#77:1:A>
That kind of a demand has been placed <,> and uh <,> enquiries are
being made with the U G C as well as <,> the state government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#78:1:A>
Recently <,,> just three days back <,,> uh <,> according to the
suggestion made <,> in the meeting of the <mention> SUPTA </mention> members
<,,> very recently held to discuss Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen
ninety-four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#79:1:A>
<-> The </-> some very important deficiencies in the Act were
discussed at that time <,> and it was suggested that <,> a committee be
constituted <,,> uh Tandurkar <,> myself <,,> uh Mr Kalme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#80:1:A>
Uh we were supposed to <,> prepare a draft <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#81:1:A>
I had been <,> keeping <+> in </+> touch with these people <,>
making request again and again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#82:1:A>
Uh may be because of their other preoccupations <,> they were not
in a position to submit their <,> uh notes or comments to me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#83:1:A>
Ultimately I had to prepare my own <,> uh note and I have sent a
note to the Government of Maharashtra <,> uh more particularly to the
Secretary <,,> uh Department <,,> of Law <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#84:1:A>
Uh of course if you want the contents of the letter <,> I can read
them out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#85:1:A>
Of course this is a very important <,> uh aspects of that Act <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#86:1:A>
So everybody should be aware of that uh <&> reads the letter </&>
to Honourable Pratima <O> one word </O> Secretary Law and Judiciary
Department <,> Government of Maharashtra Mantralaya Bombay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#87:1:A>
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four that is the
subject <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#88:1:A>
Madam <,,> uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of
<mention> SUPTA </mention> <,,> I in the capacity of Secretary seek your
permission to submit following modifications <,> for your kind consideration
and necessary action <,> under Section one one six of the Act <,> Maharashtra
Act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#89:1:A>
Number one <,,> uh section twelve one A I <,> should be deleted <,>
as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university
<,> because <,> secretary <,,> higher education and technical education <,>
becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#90:1:A>
It would be more appropriate <,> to allow <,> the Senate of the
university <,> to nominate <,,> this person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#91:1:A>
I hope you remember <,> that in the selection committee for the
<w> Vice-chancellor's </w> posting <,> the new act provides for <,,> a
committee of five persons <,,> one nominee of the academic council <,> the
other nominee of the management council <,> the third would be <,> the
nominee of the Univesity Grants Commission <,> the fourth is <,> the
secretary in-charge of higher and technical education <,> and the fifth is
the nominee of the <}> <-> <.> govern </.> uh </- > <=> Governor </=> </}>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#92:1:A>
Uh very interestingly <,> the position of the Secretary for higher
and technical education is <,> secondary to the position of a
Vice-chancellor <,> and <,> in the actual conduct or operation of this particular
Act <,> the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and
subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be
a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same
Vice-chancellor whom he appoints <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#93:1:A>
So both for him and for the Vice-chancellor perhaps <,> the things
would be very awkward <,> and everybody has agreed to this even <,> uh in a
recently conducted meeting of <mention> SUPTA </mention> <,> uh sorry
<mention> SUTA </mention> <,> this point was raised and they have also <,>
agreed <,> that something will have to be done regarding <,> this particular
point <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#94:1:A>
Uh let me clarify <,,> U G C has to nominate <,> one member <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#95:1:A>
The academic council of the state university will have to nominate
another member <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#96:1:A>
The management council of the same university nominated one more
member <,> the Governor also has nominated the third <,> fourth member that
is one <,> uh Mr B G Deshmukh <,> the chairman of the <,> rest of Maharashtra
<,> what you call <mention> Vaidhanik Vikas Mandal </mention> or something
like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#97:1:A>
And uh <,> the Secretary in-charge of higher and technical
education is not to be nominated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-077#98:1:A>
He is automatically by his position <,> a member of the selection
committee <,> ex- official </I>
