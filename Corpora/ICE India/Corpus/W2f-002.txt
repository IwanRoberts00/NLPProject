SHORT STORY

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#2:1>
by Malathi Rao

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#3:1>
<h> <bold> Coming home </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> AT </smallcaps> </bold> last, she was accepted by
them, the elders of the community, though they looked at her squat, tub-like
body and thought she was tough, tougher than any of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#5:1>
Every now and then Chaddhasaab had to chide her, <quote> " Now,
madam, be Indian, this is Bharat; <w> you're </w> no longer in London (
London for them meant anywhere in England ) and things are done with a lot
of sentiment.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#6:1>
When your daughter comes home, <w> we'll </w> all be there to do an
<indig> <it> arti </it> </indig> for her <*> dotted line</*> for isn't she
the <indig> Lakshmi </indig> of your house, madam." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#7:1>
<indig> " Bhaisaab," </indig> Ammu laughed raucously, <quote> "
all these days I thought I was the <indig> Lakshmi </indig> of this abode,
how can you dislodge me <*> dotted line</*>?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#8:1>
Chaddhasaab hee-hawed as the others joined him in the laughter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#9:1>
<quote> " <w> You've </w> to inform us, madam, of the time the plane
arrives, <w> we'll </w> be there to receive her with music and garlands of
flowers." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#10:1>
Ammu tried to work up some enthusiasm for the sake of the
community elders.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#11:1>
But she knew her daughter, Renuka, very modern and all that,
wouldn't care for this reception from her <w> mother's </w> friends.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#12:1>
Renuka would wear her hoity-toity expression, and of course, blame
her mother for the <quote> " vulgar show" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#13:1>
What could Ammu do?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#14:1>
The elders considered her as their comunity leader, maybe because
she was England-returned, or spoke better English than any one of them, or
because she could bully everyone without fear. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#15:1>
It was the younger <quote> ` set' </quote> who didn't know what
to make of her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#16:1>
To the servants of the locality, especially the <indig> <it>
chokras </it> </indig> , she was neither <indig> <it> desi </it> </indig> nor
<indig> <it> angrez </it> </indig> , man nor woman.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#17:1>
Her abusive language made them snigger uncomfortably. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#18:1>
Shankar, the first time he encountered Ammu, was so
terrified by her that he urinated in his pants. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#19:1>
Actually it happened at dusk on a Sunday evening.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#20:1>
Ammu was taking her usual constitutional around the central lawn.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#21:1>
She was about to turn in when she saw this strange youth sidling
against the wall.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#22:1>
He seemed to be urinating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#23:1>
Her first instinct was that he was an intruder, and as a
community welfare-in-charge, she thought it her duty to question him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#24:1>
When she moved in his direction, however, the boy started running.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#25:1>
Now her suspicions were fully roused and she was determined to
give him hot chase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#26:1>
With her short grey hair streaking on her narrow forehead, she
sprinted like a Lhasa Apso after him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#27:1>
<indig> " Chor, chor," </indig> she screamed as she panted for
breath, forgetting her heart conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#28:1>
She looked as though she was going to collapse. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#29:1>
The boy, however, was in full form; he wove in and out of the
block of flats and it was obvious Ammu was no match for him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#30:1>
The few elders who had joined the run tried to stop her but in vain.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#31:1>
She led them on for <w> she'd </w> <quote> ` spied' </quote> the
boy as he plunged into the flat opposite hers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#32:1>
Ammu followed him into the flat. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#33:1>
She didn't know Mrs. Gupta very well, but she explained the
situation to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#34:1>
Mrs. Gupta looked bored, as though she wanted to fall asleep.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#35:1>
But Ammu wouldn't budge; she was prepared to wait.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#36:1>
Finally, Shankar came out at his <w> mistress' </w> bidding and stood
with a sullen expression on his face.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#37:1>
Ammu stared at him and asked him curtly, <quote> " What were you
hanging out there for?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#38:1>
<quote> " I was urinating," </quote> he confessed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#39:1>
<quote> " You know you can be whipped for that ?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#40:1>
I won't tolerate any of this nonsense.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#41:1>
Mrs. Gupta, you should keep him in control." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#42:1>
The next day the story went round the block that shankar had
urinated through sheer fear on seeing Ammu.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#43:1>
Some of his friends claimed that she had the same terrifying effect
on most of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#44:1>
While Ammu herself took the stand that Shankar had
deliberately committed nuisance in a public place.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#45:1>
She kept a close watch on him, making a note of his movements and
regarding him in general as a potential criminal - - until one day, the
situation changed drastically for Ammu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#46:1>
This change <w> I'm </w> going to narrate now took place two
weeks after the Great Chase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#47:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> RENUKA </smallcaps> </bold> had come
unanounced in the middle of the night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#48:1>
There could be neither a reception nor an <indig> <it> arti </it>
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#49:1>
She missed nothing, however, for she was used to <w> Ammu's </w>
ways. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#50:1>
Hardly had she been there for two days when Ammu started nagging
her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#51:1>
Do this, do that, don't do this and don't do that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#52:1>
The fact that they had no servant in the house made things too
irksome for them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#53:1>
The elders did a belated <indig> <it> arti </it> </indig> for the
girl, welcoming her as the <indig> Lakshmi </indig> of the house, at which
Ammu brayed in drunken laughter as <w> she'd </w> taken to heavy drinking
since <w> Renuka's </w> arrival.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#54:1>
Renuka was fed up of the whole business of homecoming. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#55:1>
The arguments grew more and more violent, until one day there was
a fight between mother and daughter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#56:1>
What happened in the dining-room that evening of August 12 no one was
to know, there were no witnesses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#57:1>
It was only between the two of them, locked in unquenchable
hatred, two people who were so intimately connected in a mother-daughter
relationship, yet had clashed in the fashion of bitter enemies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#58:1>
However, what everyone came to know was that because of <w>
Renuka's </w> visit Ammu had suffered a heart attack.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#59:1>
The elders came immediately, of course, for Renuka knew nothing about
hospitals in Delhi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#60:1>
She stood around stricken with guilt, not able to help in any
way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#61:1>
Ammu had a regular taxi driver, a <indig> <it> sardarji </it>
</indig> , at the taxistand under the cassia tree. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#62:1>
He now came with his mate, and between them, they carried Ammu to
the taxi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#63:1>
The <indig> <it> sardarji </it> </indig> knew <w> Ammu's </w> ways
pretty well and he now asked Renuka as he started the egine, <quote> " Hope
<w> it's </w> not her drinking that has brought on this attack?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#64:1>
Renuka had nothing to say, she only sulked. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#65:1>
In the hospital Ammu was twitching in semi-coma on the first
night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#66:1>
The doctors put her through all the tests and declared there was
no danger to her life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#67:1>
They put her on a strict <O> sketch </O> regimen - - no cigarettes,
no alcohol. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#68:1>
The two weeks in the hospital seemed like a hundred years to
Ammu, though she did flirt outrageously with a duty doctor one day, a shy
young man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#69:1>
Renuka was chafing too, for <w> she'd </w> to get back to her job
in London.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#70:1>
Her leave was coming to an end.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#71:1>
As soon as Ammu was discharged, Renuka wanted to make her departure.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#72:1>
But there was a relapse of some kind and the doctors said they would
keep the patient for another three days for observation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#73:1>
Now, this set Ammu worrying about the flat and Renuka. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#74:1>
In all this, she had not forgotten the urinating boy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#75:1>
Lying in the hospital bed, she gave all her thought to him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#76:1>
She closed her eyes and tried to recapture those odd features. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#77:1>
Hadn't she thought there was something primitive about him the
very first time <w> she'd </w> set eyes on him?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#78:1>
It was his eyes that had struck her as being abnormal.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#79:1>
He never seemed to blink them and she could have been staring at a
pair of cold stones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#80:1>
Ammu gave an involuntary shudder at the memory.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#81:1>
But why hadn't Renuka come at her usual visiting hour?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#82:1>
It was past six <w> O'clock </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#83:1>
She shuddered again as she saw, in a hallucinatory flash, Renuka
gagged and bound in the lonely flat and Shankar ransacking the almirahs,
throwing <w> Ammu's </w> <indig> saris </indig> and clothes around. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#84:1>
<quote> " <indig> Ma </indig> , you look tired," </quote> came
<w> Renuka's </w> voice as in a dream and Ammu came back to consciousness,
trying to register where she was. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#85:1>
<quote> " <indig> Ma </indig> , <w> I've </w> brought you some
nice soup today.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#86:1>
Just tell me how it tastes, OK?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#87:1>
<quote> " You made it for me, darling?" </quote> she said, her
bad thoughts receding at the sight of <w> Renuka's </w> soft youthful looks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#88:1>
She was already feeling a lot better and had forgiven Renuka for what
<w> she'd </w> said the other day in the dining-room. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#89:1>
I suppose every child at some time or the other has said what
Renuka had accused her of.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#90:1>
How could a mother not love her child?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#91:1>
Even in her most monstrous, hateful moments, Ammu had discovered
within herself this attachment for her child. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#92:1>
She, Renuka, had hurt Ammu very badly at times, she brought
anyone home, had married that African boy, Salim, without even introducing
him to her, and had broken up with him recently.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#93:1>
What was all this?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#94:1>
When she had asked Renuka, <quote> " What went wrong dear?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#95:1>
The answer was, <quote> " What went wrong with <w> your's </w> ,
<indig> ma </indig> ? " </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#96:1>
<quote> " How is everything at the flat, darling.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#97:1>
And who made this soup?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#98:1>
Ammu could smell the aroma of the soup as it was poured into the cup.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#99:1>
She felt homesick for the flat, the dining-room with the sideboard
groaning with all the flowered crockery <w> she'd </w> transported from her
home in Surrey. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#100:1>
<quote> " The doctor says <w> you're </w> to be discharged,
<indig> ma </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#101:1>
So <w> you'll </w> be home tomorrow." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#102:1>
<quote> " <w> That's </w> good news," </quote> mumbled Ammu.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#103:1>
<quote> " <w> I'm </w> longing to get back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#104:1>
<w> What've </w> you have been eating, darling?

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#105:1>
<w> I'm </w> a bad mother, aren't I?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#106:1>
<quote> " <w> You're </w> an angel, <indig> ma </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#107:1>
Besides, <w> there's </w> this new chap.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#108:1>
Won't you taste your soup now, <w> it's </w> getting cold." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#109:1>
Ammu had slid back against her pillows.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#110:1>
<quote> " So tired, I don't know why.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#111:1>
And so drowsy <*> dotted line</*>" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#112:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> next morning, Renuka
was really considerate to her mother, helping her into the taxi and taking
her inside the flat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#113:1>
Ammu looked around critically, for she seemed to see too <O>
Continued on Page 8 </O> <O>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#114:1>
<h> <bold> Coming home </bold> </h> </O> <O> Continued from Page 7
</O> many subtle changes in these two weeks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#115:1>
A strange silence coiled round her, strangulating her with some
inexplicable fear.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#116:1>
<quote> " What is wrong <indig> ma </indig> ? " </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#117:1>
Renuka queried as Ammu turned round sharply, almost lunging into
him, so close was he standing to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#118:1>
The boy with the unblinking eyes now fixed her with a basilisk
stare. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#119:1>
<quote> " What are you doing here?" </quote> she asked in her
most imperious voice.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#120:1>
Renuka burst into giggles.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#121:1>
The boy twisted a duster between his stubby fingers as if he was
wringing the neck of a chicken. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#122:1>
<quote> " <indig> Ma </indig> , " </quote> spluttered Renuka
between giggles, <quote> " this is our new cook, Shankar.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#123:1>
He makes the most fabulous soups, you know." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#124:1>
But Ammu ignored Renuka.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#125:1>
<quote> " Why are you in my house, answer me." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#126:1>
Ammu moved towards the boy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#127:1>
<quote> " Don't you know <w> I'm </w> the <indig> Lakshmi </indig>
of this house and not Renuka?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#128:1>
<quote> " <indig> Ma <*> dotted line</*> </indig> " </quote>
Renuka tried to step between them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#129:1>
But the boy was too quick.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#130:1>
He whipped out a long gleaming knife and lunged at Ammu <*> dotted
line</*> and Renuka screamed, <quote> " <indig> Maaaaa <*> dotted line</*>
</indig> " </quote> </p> <*> two asterisks in the center </*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-002#131:1>
<quote> " <indig> Ma </indig> , wake up." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#132:1>
Renuka was softly shaking <w> Ammu's </w> shoulder.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#133:1>
Ammu slowly opened her eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#134:1>
She looked around in a daze and painfully recognised the blue wall
paper of the hospital room. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2F-002#135:1>
