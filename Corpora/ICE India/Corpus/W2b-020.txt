<ICE-IND:W2B-020#2:1>
For those under the illusion that jails are meant to reform
wrongdoers, <bold> NARESH FERNANDES </bold> provides a picture of life in
Indian prisons today </p> </&> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#3:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> press reports are sketchy
but alarmingly regular.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#4:1>
On an average of three times a month, we read reports on torture and
deaths in lock-ups, or of the grim conditions in our prisons. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#5:1>
Last fortnight, a writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court
seeking an inquiry into deaths in <w> Delhi's </w> Tihar Jail; it was
based on a report by the <w> People's </w> Union for Democratic Rights
that 230 inmates had died in Tihar jail since 1988 - - one every 11 days.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#6:1>
In March four prisoners died in a 12 day period in West <w>
Bengal's </w> Chaibasa jail, the victimes of unsanitary conditions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#7:1>
We have read of the filth in Dum Dum prison, called a <quote> `
torture cell for the mentally ill inmaters who form half its
population.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#8:1>
And the press used hundreds of column centimetres to expose the
situation in Bombay lock-ups after the city police illegible herded
hundreds of people into cells after the March bomb blasts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#9:1>
But neither the press reports nor the numerous judicial
commissions that have been appointed to inquire into prison
conditions have been able to improve life behind bars for the
approximately 250.000 people in <w> India's </w> 1,114 penitentiaries.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#10:1>
<quote> " Applying even the most retrogressive standards,
Indian prisons are the pits - - a level of perversity matched only by
our pious, moralistic and sanctimonious preaching abroad," </quote> notes
lawyer Colin Gonsalves, co-editor of the book <it> Leading Cases in <w>
Prisoners' </w> Rights </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#11:1>
Among the charges Gonsalves levels at jail authorities: <quote> "
Rape, buggery, torture, custody without legal sanction, bars and fetters,
detention far in excess of the sentence, solitary confinement, the
brutalising of children, women and casuals, drug trafficking and
prostitution rackets run by superintendents." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#12:1>
The international group Human Rights Watch, which in 1991
published a report on prison conditions in India, faults the authorities
for torture in remand, rape and molestation of women in custody, deaths in
custody, poor medical facilities and lack of sanitation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#13:1>
To the trained observer, two features of <w> India's </w> reform
programme leap to the eye.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#14:1>
Says Human Rights Watch <quote> " The Indian jail system has a
class system that helps it maintain a uniqueness from penitentiaries
around the world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#15:1>
Prisoners are classified into <quote> ` A' </quote> , <quote> ` B'
</quote> and <quote> ` C' </quote> categories not on the severity of their
crimes but by social status, education and habit of life." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#16:1>
The other characteristic that stands out is the system of <quote>
` convict officers' </quote> who are classified as watchmen, overseers and
warders.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#17:1>
Appointed by the prison superintendents from among the ranks of
the longest serving inmates - - and thus those convicted of the most
serious crimes - - they perform the duties that prison guards perform
in other countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#18:1>
<quote> " The effect of the convict officer system is to
transform many Class <mention> C </mention> prisoners into personal
servants for the convictofficers on whom they are dependent in many ways,
particularly for the quantity of food they get," </quote> notes the Human
Rights Watch report. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#19:1>
To the casual visitor, however, the most striking feature of
Indian prisons is the ridiculously high level of overcrowding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#20:1>
New <w> Delhi's </w> Tihar jail has an official capacity of 2,140.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#21:1>
In January 1993 it had 7,616 inmates and the figure rose to 8,700
earlier this year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#22:1>
<w> Bombay's </w> Arthur Road jail houses 2,200 people in a
facility designed for 800.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#23:1>
In <w> Bihar's </w> Naw-pada jail, 500 men are cramped into an area
meant for 84.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#24:1>
The 19,700 square feet of <w> Kerala's </w> 12 prisons hold 14,343
people instead of the 5,471 they are supposed to accommodate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#25:1>
The tragedy plays itself out all around the country. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#26:1>
The government-run National Human Rights Commission blames
<quote> <}> <-> " unconsciencable </-> <+> unconscienable </+> </}> delays in
the disposal of cases" </quote> for the brutal situation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#27:1>
Overcrowding can mainly be attributed to the fact that most people in
Indian jails are undertrials, who are not convicted.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#28:1>
The percentage varies around the country, but figures from Madhya
Pradesh are probably representative of the trend, only eight of every 100
inimates of that <w> state's </w> facilities have been tried and convicted.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#29:1>
<quote> " The overcrowding causes all the other problems,"
</quote> maintains Ramesh Aiyer, a legal aid worker in <w> Bombay's </w>
Arthur Road prison, who has worked in facilities in Tamil Nadu.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#30:1>
<quote> " The high density of prisons means that all the
facilities are spread very thin." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#31:1>
The sheer numbers ensure that the prison authorities are seldom
able to devote attention to the problems of individual prisoners.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#32:1>
And, of course, physical facilities are stretched beyond their
limits.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#33:1>
Bedding and clothing are not always adequate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#34:1>
The food is often substandard ( a condition aggravated by large scale
pilferage and adulteration by the authorities in some centres).

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#35:1>
Sanitation problems seem to follow as a matter of course. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#36:1>
<quote> " There was only one toilet for 75 women.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#37:1>
And when we took our baths, we had to share two taps in the
courtyard," </quote> recalls social worker Sangeeta Khoparde of her stay
in Arthur Road Jail last year; her demonstrations against human rights
violations have also earned her stints in Kalyan and Osmanabad prisons
which she says are as daunting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#38:1>
A magesterial inquiry into the death of prisoners in Tihar in
1992 described the sanitary facilites thus: <quote> " All the toilets,
both inside and outside the barracks, cells and outside cells, were in
deplorable condition.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#39:1>
They were choked with hung mounds of excreta, which had not been
cleared for days.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#40:1>
In some cases they were choked right up to the door and it could not
be opened.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#41:1>
There was absolutely no facility of water." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#42:1>
The solution is obvious.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#43:1>
New prisons must be constructed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#44:1>
But officials plead that they are hampered by a lack of funds and
cannot even renovate or expand the 187 prisons that are over 100 years old
and the 27 that are more than 130 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#45:1>
Social workers familiar with the workings of prison
administrators, however, believe that the problem is more than merely
monetary.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#46:1>
They content that insensitive, bureaucrats have allowed our prisons
to deteriorate, and have displayed little initiative in attempting to stem
the rot.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#47:1>
Often, the administrators have been downright incompetent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#48:1>
<quote> " Our jails are run by people who are simply looking for
jobs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#49:1>
They have no special aptitude for criminal reformation." </quote>
maintains Sheela Barse who was on the 1988 National Experts Committee
on Women Prisoners. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#50:1>
Dr D R Singh, head of the department of criminology and
correctional administration at the Tata Institute of Social Science
believes that the families in the <w> government's </w> intends to hire
trained staff to administer correctional facilities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#51:1>
Jailors around the country land their jobs by appearing for a
statelevel competitive examination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#52:1>
Singh maintains that the perfunctory training that they receive is
of dubious value. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#53:1>
Experts contend that a system stalled by indifferent
administrators only breeds corruption.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#54:1>
And it has resulted in the Indian prison sytem acquiring a character
that is more punitive than reformative. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#55:1>
Jail supervisors, ignorant of the basic tenets of psychology,
often order even harmless prisoners to be fettered for long periods.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#56:1>
This attitude also leads to several categories of prisoners being put
in the cells together.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#57:1>
Petty criminals, first-time offenders, juveniles and non-criminal
lunatics are housed with hardened criminals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#58:1>
The herding together of these incongruent groups subverts the basic
function of incarceration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#59:1>
As psychologist Jyotsna Shah recently noted, instead of serving as
therapy and guidance centres, Indian jails <quote> " function with a built-in
contagious sub-culture of crime." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#60:1>
From the records, one would wonder how things have been allowed
to reach this perilous state: the shelves of government libraries are
creaking with advice from a profusion of national and state-level
committees and study groups.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#61:1>
Progressive programmes have been drawn up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#62:1>
The Mulla committee of 1983, for example, prescribed latitude with
regard to parole, liberal permission for interviews with prisoners and
recommended that prisoners be freely allowed to write letters. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#63:1>
But, as most commission reports in this country, these
suggestions have to be implemented.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#64:1>
Even the Indian jail Committee, Report of 1919-20 still has to be
fully adopted, so how can you expect them to consider something so recent?
asks Singh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#65:1>
This provides little hope for the Indian prisoner.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#66:1>
Colin Gonsalves insists that government callousness is to blame
for the abysmal conditions that stare detenues in the face.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#67:1>
<quote> " If the complete absence of human rights moorings in
India has escaped notice, it is only because the state has, through law and
<indig> <it> lathi </it> </indig> , shrouded the prison system with an iron
curtain through which only those may pass who have no hope of return,"
</quote> he observes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#68:1>
And while the press, the public and the social activist is

These are the words of a young man who was picked up for <quote> "

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#76:1>
Raj Pal Dhal, his brothers and sister-in-law were repeatedly
beaten and administered shocks during their eight-day-long detention.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#77:1>
The reason?

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#78:1>
The Ghaziabad police wanted to force <w> Raj's </w> brother, Atul to
surrender.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#79:1>
<w> Atul's </w> crime?

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#80:1>
He had married the daughter of a liquor contracter, against her <w>
father's </w> wishes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#81:1>
Ignorance, corruption and perennial shortages explain in part
the horrendous conditions of prison life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-020#82:1>
But they do not explain the routine brutality in police custody.

In the early 80s <mention> Lokshahi Hakk Sanghatana </mention>

Among its findings: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-020#85:1>
All the victims were poor.
