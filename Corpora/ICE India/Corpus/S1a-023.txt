<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#1:1:A>
Oh uh <,> I am very happy to have met you rather <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#2:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#3:1:A>
Uh uh I uh can't spell it <,,> a kind of <,> pleasant occasion
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#4:1:B>
Yeah surely <w> it's </w> a <,,> equally a pleasure for me <,>
that I met you

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#5:1:A>
Oh thank you very much sir <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#6:1:A>
Uh <,> so <w> it's </w> uh <,> I can say a few words <,> about an
institute where I have been <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#7:1:B>
Yeah please let me know something about the institute <{> <[>
where you worked </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#8:1:A>
<[> Uh yeah yeah </[> </{> <,> uh <w> that's </w> what I
understand that <,,> people I was under the impression that <,> uh almost for
the educated people are aware of <mention> Birla Institute of Technology
</mention>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#9:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[> as <w> it's </w> quite
reputed one

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#10:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#11:1:B>
You are right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#12:1:A>
But I understand <,,> some of our participants <,> who have
been here <,> are not <,,> uh as much aware of the institution as I expected
<,> rather

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#13:1:B>
Well for myself atleast I <w> I'm </w>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#14:1:A>
Ah <indig> accha </indig> thank you

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#15:1:A>
Yeah <,> uh <w> it's </w> in fact a kind of <,> unique institute
<,> in the sense <,> I say that uh it in fact uh motivates the students <,>
in such a way that they become <,> quite <,> uh uh <}> <-> what </-> <=> what
</=> </}> should I say is <,> acquiring <,> a sort of managerial quality <,>
with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market <,> <{>
<[> field </[> uh uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#16:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#17:1:B>
Now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh
higher education institutes is that the products <,,> uh do not come out very
well equipped <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#18:1:B>
And they flood the market <,> there are no job opportunities for
them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#19:1:A>
Yeah <,> yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#20:1:B>
But uh products who come out of your <,> institute <,> <{> <[>
yeah <,> are really absorbed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#21:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#22:1:A>
Yeah sure <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#23:1:B>
And uh for <{1> <[1> yeah <,> quality goods there is always a
demand <{2> <[2> yeah <,> one should say <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#24:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#25:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#26:1:A>
Yeah sure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#27:1:A>
And more over they take a kind of uh national cream I must say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#28:1:A>
And uh <,> half of the credit goes to rather saying that the
institute <,> is able to provide something to such an extent that <,,> each
brings that <,,> there I must say uh <w> they've </w> become quite <,> fit to
the society

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#29:1:A>
But basically they are brilliant <,> students when they come to the
institute

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#30:1:A>
Because <,> uh they input <,,> I would say that <,,> are really
brilliant uh they score <,> above ninety-three percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#31:1:A>
Based on their merit they get into the institute <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#32:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#33:1:B>
Uh <w> it's </w> not only that uh the best students come to this
institute

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#34:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#35:1:B>
They are also given the best <,> kind of training

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#36:1:A>
Yeah <w> that's </w> there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#37:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#38:1:A>
Uh but the best <{> <[> kind of </[> uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#39:1:B>
<[> I wish </[> </{> <,> I wish there were more institutions
of this type

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#40:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#41:1:B>
Uh in the country

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#42:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#43:1:B>
Unfortunately there are only <,,> just one or two here <,> <{>
<[> yeah <,> to be counted on <w> finger's </w> end <,> like an island

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#44:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#45:1:A>
Yeah <O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#46:1:B>
You know sea of mediocrity <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#47:1:A>
You know <,> <w> it's </w> good that though the institute has
been <,> in Rajasthan <,> uh I would say that it <w> it's </w> in fact a kind
of oasis <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#48:1:B>
Yeah oasis <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#49:1:A>
Uh I was quite surprised to see <,> how in that <,> uh desert
atmosphere <,> uh uh G D Birla was able to establish such a great institute
<,,> uh which <,,> in fact <,,> has become popular at the international level
rather

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#50:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#51:1:A>
And moreover I understand <,,> when our students <,,> uh come
to the <,,> third level which we say <,,> third year rather when they come to
the third year <,> their attention is mainly towards <,> preparing for GRE
<,> and get out of this country <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#52:1:B>
Uhm <,> <w> that's </w> rather unfortunate

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#53:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#54:1:B>
Because we spend so much on them <,> and <,> the best mind <,>
the best talent <,> the best energies of the country flow out of it <,> <{>
<[> yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#55:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a pity that India doesn't get the benefit out of
these <,,> uh the best minds the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#56:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#57:1:A>
One way we have to accept this also this India is not able to
provide better opportunity <,,> uh to their expectations rather <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#58:1:A>
So <,,> and I am very happy still <,> the students <,,> uh foreign
United States of America <,> uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute
<,,> uh the what to say is <,> to their almamater <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#59:1:A>
And they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute <,>
still further developes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#60:1:A>
And uh I understand a few students have given a sort of <,> a
statement to the authorities that <,,> uh they are collecting some <,> amount
<,,> which would in fact <,,> uh update <,> the computer centre <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#61:1:A>
Uh its quite <,> uh remarkable approach on their part I feel <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#62:1:B>
Uhm I wish not only would such an institute be updated <,,>
but more such institutes were <,,> uh started in other parts of the country
<,,> so that <,,> uh all the regions <,,> stand to benefit <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#63:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#64:1:B>
And the country as a whole <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> uh progresses

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#65:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#66:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#67:1:A>
But in that sense I say that I see <,,> in <mention> Pilani
</mention> <,,> I must say all the states <,,> a country <,,> a country in
Pilani I could see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#68:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#69:1:A>
Uh national integration rather

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#70:1:B>
Yeah yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#71:1:A>
Uh I could experience

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#72:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#73:1:A>
And moreover <,> the students are highly disciplined I must
say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#74:1:A>
I was told <,,> by then I wasn't there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#75:1:A>
But even at the time of the <,> Mandal Commissions <,,> I I could
understand that all over the country <,> the students were on strike <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#76:1:A>
But uh that was the only institute which was functioning

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#77:1:B>
Where there was no disturbances

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#78:1:A>
No not at all <,> <{> <[> very kind <,,> ah not at all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#79:1:B>
<[> Very kind </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#80:1:A>
And uh <,> the students you know because <,> they are much <,>
uh motivated <,> uh towards <,> getting trained <,> with which they will be
able to get into better industries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#81:1:A>
And one more good thing I would like to say about our institute is
<,> we have a practice school system

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#82:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#83:1:A>
Uh with which in fact <,> <w> they're </w> able to give the
better training to the students and they are able to expose their better
products <,> to the country rather I would say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#84:1:B>
I see <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#85:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#86:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#87:1:A>
See <,> we have a practice school system in such a sense <,,>
uh a practice school training <,> running of about four months at the end of
the second year <,> <{> <[> uhn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#88:1:A>
And uh they got to go to <,> they have to go to different
industries <,,> where <,,> the students are expected <,> to go <,> and do
some industrial training <,> but this does not mean that they can go alone
and do away <,,> with some work and get <,> and report that they have done
the report that they have done some industrial training or something <w> it's
</w> not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#89:1:A>
When they send the students they are sending the faculty members
also to look after <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#90:1:B>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#91:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#92:1:A>
Uh <,> this programme is going on for about <,,> in eighty
centres all over the country <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#93:1:B>
Eighty centres <,> <{> <[> eighty centres <,,> are there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#94:1:A>
<[> Eighty centres </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#95:1:A>
And we have practice school too <,> running of about six
months <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#96:1:A>
And I understand there are for about thirty faculty members <,,>
are staying outside <,> to look after the students

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#97:1:B>
I see <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#98:1:B>
All the care for the students in a way <,> and <,,> looked to their
<,,> academic <,> upbringing <,> in all possible ways so that <,> uh they
turn up to their best <,,> uh lot <,> the best products <,> of the
educational system that <,> uh exist in the country <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#99:1:A>
No I would say that <,> uh in fact the <,> system of education
uh <w> that's </w> there in this Pilani I would say that it is quite
application oriented

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#100:1:B>
Oh I see

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#101:1:A>
Uh how it would be quiet useful <,> to give a kind of life
skill for a student

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#102:1:B>
But elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#103:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#104:1:B>
<w> It's </w> only a theoritical approach <,,> and most of
the students who come out of these institutes <,,> have only a theoritical
background <{> <[> and </[> in the practical world <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> they
are not much of a success

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#105:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#106:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#107:1:A>
Yeah you take for example <,> uh I belong to the Department
of English

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#108:1:A>
We have MA honours in English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#109:1:A>
But when I say that we have MA honours in English it doesn't mean
that the subjects <,,> taught <,> are purely confined to only the literature
field <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#110:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#111:1:A>
See for about first two years the respective of any
disciplines <,> they are exposed to common <,> these common subjects <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#112:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#113:1:A>
A student who is admitted in MA honours in English <,> he
will be exposed to thermodynamics <,> <{1> <[1> I see <,> will be exposed to
computer science <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#114:1:A>
<w> He'll </w> be exposed to physics <,> <{2> <[2> uh <,> and
chemistry

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#115:1:B>
<[1> I see </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#116:1:B>
<[2> Uh </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#117:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#118:1:A>
So irrespective of any discipline <,> a student who is
admitted in <,> uh computer science will be doing the same course of <,> the
student <}> <-> who has who has </-> <=> who has </=> </}> been admitted into
<,> MA honours in English

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#119:1:B>
Oh I see <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#120:1:A>
So they are exposed to Compulsory Disciplinary Course

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#121:1:A>
We call it CDC <,> only when they come to the third year <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#122:1:B>
Ah right <,> <{> <[> again <,> it is a sort of
interdiscipline

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#123:1:A>
<[> Again </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#124:1:A>
Interdisciplinary <w> that's </w> why <,> they call it first
integrated degree

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#125:1:B>
Ah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#126:1:B>
One cannot uh I should say <,,> one <}> <-> should be </-> <=>
should be </=> </}> happy to see such an institution <,,> having been
developed <,,> in some part of the country <,> if not in our own part near
our home <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#127:1:B>
And uh I should compliment you on

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#128:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#129:1:B>
Being on the staff of such an institute

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#130:1:A>
<O> Laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#131:1:A>
Thank you sir

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#132:1:B>
Uh it is not <w> everybody's </w> lot <,,> to be <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#133:1:A>
Yeah in that sense

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#134:1:B>
A part of such an institution

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#135:1:A>
Yeah <w> I'm </w> really happy though <w> I'm </w> quite away
from <,> my home town <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#136:1:A>
I am very happy that <,> I am working in an institute which is
known for an academic excellence

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#137:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#138:1:A>
And the students are very bright <,> so we have got a kind of
job satisfaction <w> that's </w> there,,

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#139:1:A>
Uh uh though there are <,> a kind of advantages and disadvantages
<,> as far as my personal point of view is concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#140:1:A>
But <,,> as an academician <,,> I am really happy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#141:1:B>
Yeah we have <,,> such an ethos

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#142:1:A>
Yeah <,,> uh ethos and academic excellence exist <,,> one
really feels <,> one is previleged to get in <{> <[> there </[> <,,> apart
from uh job satisfaction

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#143:1:B>
<[> There </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#144:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#145:1:A>
Though I was not <,,> uh as happy as I am <,> now

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#146:1:A>
Now I consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#147:1:B>
Yeah really <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> one should

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#148:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#149:1:A>
Yeah when I left Madurai <,> where I had been working <,> uh
I in fact was not at all <,> uh willing to go to such a place <,> which is
quite a far off from my place

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#150:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#151:1:A>
But now I don't have that uh feeling what should I call sense
a hallucination <,> <{> <[> uh <,> <}> <-> <w> I'm </w> not </-> <=> <w> I'm
</w> not </=> </}> at all suffering from that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#152:1:B>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#153:1:B>
Uhm you are all saint of the country so to say <O> laughter
</O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#154:1:A>
And uh one more thing I would say that <,> uh students have
been in BITS Pilani <,,> are <,,> uh quite more in number <,,> from south
rather

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#155:1:B>
I see <,> oh <w> that's </w> uh <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> rather
strange

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#156:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#157:1:A>
Yeah <,,> that I would say is truely beecause <,> uh the
admission takes place <,> is done merit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#158:1:A>
I am very happy to say that there is <,> not even a single seat
<,> for the chairman of the institute

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#159:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#160:1:A>
<w> It's </w> really remarkable <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#161:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#162:1:A>
Uh uh they don't interfere <,,> in the admission process <,,>
and <,,> even if the <w> Vice-Chancellor's </w> son <,> gets <,,> <}> <->
point point </-> <=> point </=> </}> <,> one percent less <,> than the
percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as
that particular year is concenred

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#163:1:A>
He also has to be out <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#164:1:B>
Oh <w> that's </w> really remarkable <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#165:1:B>
We don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#166:1:B>
See everywhere else in the country <,> people in <w> position's
</w> of power and authority try to manoeuvre

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#167:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#168:1:B>
The <,,> the admissions <,> uh even the academic grades that
are given <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#169:1:B>
Sometimes the <w> professor's </w> son <,> or daughter himself or
herself get the gold medal <,> though <,,> they might have <,> not even <,>
ordinarily got a second class <,> let alone a first class <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#170:1:B>
So we have heard many such stories from elsewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#171:1:B>
But in <,> at Pilani such a thing <,> a really exists one should
be happy as well as proud <,> <,> <{> <[> uhm also <,> of such an ideally
ideal institution

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#172:1:A>
<[> Uhm also </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#173:1:A>
Also <w> it's </w> quite a known for cultural festivals

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#174:1:A>
They <,> celebrate a festival called <,> <mention> Oasis
</mention> which is once in a year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#175:1:A>
And the students are given enormous freedom <,> and they collect
the funds from different sources <,> I mean many firms are sponsoring <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#176:1:A>
And they are able to <,> uh going out the function called
<mention> Oasis </mention> in such a manner that <,> it is <,> uh uh what to
say <,> uh known and famous at the national level <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#177:1:B>
What <O> one or two words </O> <,> uh I mean the management
of the institute is allowed to <,,> keep for the best <,> available in the
country to their students to their alumni <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#178:1:B>
They do not spare any kind of effort <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#179:1:A>
Of course the these cultural festivals are organised by
students themselves

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#180:1:B>
By students themselves <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#181:1:A>
Yes <w> it's </w> they who collect the fund <,> <{> <[> <w>
it's </w> they who collect fund <,,> organise

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#182:1:B>
<[> <w> It's </w> they who collect fund </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#183:1:B>
No doubt about that all should give a kind of better training
for the students <,> this is what I should say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#184:1:A>
And uh moreover sir <,> uh though the students are prepare to
soil their hands <,,> anywhere <,,> <w> it's </w> not the case with supposing
somebody gives the training in the name of MBA graduates or whatever <,> we
also have got <,,> a degree programme called MMS <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#185:1:A>
And the students who come out with a degree MMS <,> I understand
that there is a report that has been received <,> uh from different firms <,>
that the students of BITS Pilani <,> specially MMS candidates <,> they are
prepared to soil their hands <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#186:1:A>
They are prepared to do any kind of work

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#187:1:A>
It is not that they demand AC room they will be sitting only in
the AC room they will be able to <,> only manage the sub-staff <,> it is not
the quality <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#188:1:A>
If the situation warrants <,> they are prepared to do any sort of
work or they are prepared to go the field <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#189:1:B>
Yes <,> it is that kind of uh <,> service motivation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#190:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#191:1:B>
And uh <,,> committment to work <,> that we should instill in
our students <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#192:1:B>
Instead what we are producing <,,> these days is <,,> uh <indig>
brown sahibs </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#193:1:B>
Those who want to be <,> uh in offices which are air conditioned
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#194:1:B>
Those who do not want to soil their hands <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#195:1:B>
Those who want to <,,> think themselves the upper crust of society
<,> born <,,> they heavenly born <,> <O> one word </O> so to say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#196:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-023#197:1:B>
To rule the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#198:1:B>
To rule over others <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-023#199:1:B>
And this is unfortunate </I>
