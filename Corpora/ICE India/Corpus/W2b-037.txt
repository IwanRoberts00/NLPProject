<bold> <smallcaps> JEAN </smallcaps> </bold> Baptiste Denis, a French
physician was convicted some three hundred years ago in 1667, for
murdering a patient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#4:1>
In fact, Denis had tried to save the life of the patient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#5:1>
He had injected <w> lambs' </w> blood into the patient in an effort
to cure him.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#6:1>
Unfortunately, the patient died and Denis, the first ever person to
transfuse blood, had the stigma of murderer stuck on to him for life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#7:1>
Two hundred years later, when bloodtransfusion was revived it
became a very common medical procedure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#8:1>
Millions of people donate blood to someone or receive it
everyday.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#9:1>
In fact thousands of soldiers surviving the second World War owe
their life to this technique.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#10:1>
Even the wonders of modern medical science like heart
transplantation and other surgeries would have been inconceivable had not
this technique of replacing lost blood rapidly been availble.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#11:1>
Today, according to a rough estimate, worldwide about 35 million
units of blood are transferred every year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#12:1>
The impact of blood tranfusion has been such that donating blood
to someone came to be considered as a supreme philanthropic gesture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#13:1>
In India enthusiastic volunteers could be seen organizing
blood-donating camps where people willingly give away some of their blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#14:1>
But, the times do change.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#15:1>
The advent of Mention> AIDS </mention> into the public health arena
is changing this scene.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#16:1>
People are more reluctant now-a-days to denote blood as it became
known that blood transfusion procedure is also one of the causes spreading
the dreaded disease Mention> AIDS </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#17:1>
The patients too are afraid of receiving blood that is not tested and
confirmed as not having <mention> AIDS </mention> virus.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#18:1>
Unfortunately modern world cannot do away with blood-transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#19:1>
World over, therefore, scientists - - chemists, physicians,
biotechnologists - - are spending sleepless nights to find an alternative
to it, an alternative that does not bring risks of diseases with it but is as
efficient in saving life as the natural blood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#20:1>
The uniqueness of blood is that it is a living fluid tissue.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#21:1>
It is also the sole vehicle which supplies necessary nutrients and
oxygen to all tissues in the body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#22:1>
The most important function of the blood, is removing accumulated
carbondioxide from the tissues and replenishing them with oxygen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#23:1>
For, human cells without exception require a regular supply of
oxygen to keep going.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#24:1>
The cells in the retina of the eye, for example, can not see
anything if it is deprived of oxygen for even a second.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#25:1>
Shutting off oxygen supply to the brain for four minutes can kill
brain cells leaving the person comatose or paralyzed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#26:1>
That is why any person who loses a lot of blood, as after an
accident, can suffer a shock and even die.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#27:1>
But he can be saved by timely replenishment of the lost blood by
transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#28:1>
For some people, sufferers of some genetic disorders such as
Thalassemia, blood transfusion is a must for survival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#29:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> Blood </smallcaps> </bold> transfusion is not a
simple transfer of blood from one person to another.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#30:1>
Before any transfusion, the blood of the donor has to be <O> sketch
in the middle of the page </O> <O> caption </O> <O> <&> page </&> 42 </O>
with that of the recipient.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#31:1>
If the two do not match, the patient may suffer a shock.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#32:1>
Jean Baptiste Denis could not succeed because he tried to transfuse
<w> lamb's </w> blood which is incompatible with <w> human's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#33:1>
Since donors whose blood matches with the recipient may not always be
present nearby during an emergency, previously collected blood and stored in
blood-banks is usually used for transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#34:1>
Storing blood for long without it getting spoiled is a costly affair.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#35:1>
But doctors today are more concerned about the hygienic quality of
the blood meant for transfusion than anything else.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#36:1>
There have been cases of Thalassemia patients inadvertently geting
infected with AIDS virus after a transfusion with contaminated blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#37:1>
There have also been cases of patients of surgery who along with the
blood also received hepatitis or a veneral disease.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#38:1>
These incidents and the increasing cases of <mention> AIDS </mention>
infection due to blood transfusion have made scientists to take a second look
at blood transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#39:1>
Can we have something that acts just like blood, is available in
plenty, and can be maintained pure?

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#40:1>
Can we produce blood outside the human body to have pure
uncontaminated blood, for trnasfusion?

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#41:1>
These are some of the questions which the scientists are trying
to find answer to. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#42:1>
The main objective of blood transfusion, in a nutshell, is to
maintain sufficient oxygen supply to the body tissues of a patient
temporarily, because given enough time his body can produce fresh blood that
takes care of oxygen transport.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#43:1>
The constituent which gives blood its distinct scarlet red colour as
well as the capability of carrying oxygen is a unique iron containing protein
called haemoglobin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#44:1>
Every millilitre of blood contains millions of red blood cells which
are nothing but bags of haemoglobin, which has a special affinity for
oxygen molecules.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#45:1>
Each haemoglobin molecule can simultaneously carry four molecules
of oxygen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#46:1>
Also it is able to carry carbondioxide ( CO<sb>2</sb> ) produced
during respiration, from cells in different parts of the body to the lungs
and exchange CO<sb>2</sb> for oxygen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#47:1>
It then returns to the cells carrying oxygenated haemoglobin to
supply oxygen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#48:1>
This important role of haemoglobin has made scientists to think
of at least two alternatives to whole-blood transfusions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#49:1>
The first is to use some synthetic chemicals which can act like
<O> <&> Chemical formula in the middle of page </&> </O> <O> caption </O>
haemoglobin to carry oxygen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#50:1>
The second is to find a way of making pure haemoglobin in large
quantities outside the body and use it directly for transfusion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#51:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> PERFLUROCARPONS </smallcaps> </bold> ( PFCs ) , a
group of synthetic chemicals that can mimic the function of haemoglobin have
been tried since 1968 as an alternative to blood transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#52:1>
These are organic compounds in which all hydrogen molecules have
been replaced with fluorine.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#53:1>
Thus a host of PFCs have been prepared and tested for their
suitability as blood substitutes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#54:1>
The most important character which makes PFCs a good candidate as
a blood substitute is their ability to dissolve large amounts of gases,
especially oxygen and carbondioxide.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#55:1>
In fact, every millilitre of a PFC can dissolve more oxygen than does
blood or water.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#56:1>
Unfortunately, almost all PFCs are solids and do not easily
dissolve in water.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#57:1>
The solvents in which they dissolve, like petroleum ether, acetone,
or benzene do not suit the human body.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#58:1>
Therefore, the PFCs have been used in the human body in the form of
colloid solutions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#59:1>
One disadvantage of using colloids is their low osmotic pressure
which can be damaging to the body cells when injected.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#60:1>
But this problem has been solved to some extent by mixing the colloid
with substances like hydroxyethyl starch to bring the osmotic pressure in
level with that of human blood or other body cells. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#61:1>
Despite these stumbling blocks the PFCs have been considered
attractive alternative to blood because they can be easily stored, can be
kept viable even after years of storage and reconstituted from a solid
form whenever necessary.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#62:1>
Moreover in cases where blood or blood products do not suit the
patients, PFCs can come to help.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#63:1>
For example, they can be used in patients who have turned allergic to
transfusion because of repeated blood transfusions, without any side-effects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#64:1>
There are other advantages also.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#65:1>
For instance, in cases of carbonmonoxide poisoning which usually
happens in a fire-accident, blood <O> <&> page </&> 43 </O> transfusions can
be of little help.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#66:1>
Carbonmonoxide in the smoke enters the blood and binds to the
haemoglobin in such a tight embrace that oxygen is unable to bind to it any
more.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#67:1>
The patient, as a result, may faint, become comatose or even die
inspite of a blood transfusion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#68:1>
But unlike haemoglobin, PFCs can transport oxygen even in the
presence of carbondioxide.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#69:1>
Rats breathing in air half of which is carbondioxide have survived
longer when infused with PFCs than those which did not receive them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#70:1>
And PFCs are not mere curiosities in the laboratories.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#71:1>
A firm in Osaka, Japan has been manufacturing two commercial
products, <it> Oxypherol </it> and <it> Fluosol-DA </it> as alternatives to
blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#72:1>
Oxypherol is intended for laboratory use, whereas <it> Fluoso-DA
</it> has been effectively used in clinics also.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#73:1>
<it> FluosolDA </it> has been licensed for use in operation
theatres where large amounts of blood is required for surgery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#74:1>
It helps in keeping the <w> patient's </w> tissues supplied with
oxygen and also saves on scarce human blood which can be used only when it is
inevitable.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#75:1>
Researches have also been on to find a PFC that is more soluble and
to make most of the already available PFCs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#76:1>
In the latter case, efforts of a Japanese company in packing these
haemoglobin-like compounds in little bags of lipid-membranes has been a
success.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#77:1>
Mice completely drained of their natural blood and replaced with such
containing liposomes survived for many days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#78:1>
PFCs can be good functional alternatives but are not as
colourful as haemoglobin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#79:1>
The mice had only PFC solution running in their veins and arteries
lost their colour of the pink eye, nose and toes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#80:1>
Therefore, the second alternative of using the natural protein itself
in place of blood has engaged the attention of scientists more than PFCs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#81:1>
Since a long time people have tried to extract pure haemoglobin from
other animals and use it in man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#82:1>
The matching of blood types which is most essential for transfusion
can be done away with if pure haemoglobin is used.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#83:1>
For, the incompatibility between different blood-groups occurs not
because of haemoglobin but because of some antigenic proteins on the surface
of redblood cells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#84:1>
Thus animal haemoglobin can also be used in humans.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#85:1>
Even the haemoglobin collected from the human blood has been tried.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#86:1>
Unfortunately, the very same protein which when packed in a red blood
cell is life-giving becomes a poison when out of it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#87:1>
For, pure haemoglobin when injected into the blood affects a vital
organ - - the kidney - - and damages it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#88:1>
Moreover, its high affinity for oxygen is lost when present free in
the blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#89:1>
The haemoglobin molecule outside the red blood cell breaks up easily
and is excreted fast through kidneys.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#90:1>
Therefore attempts are now on to <O> in box </O> make cell-free
haemoglobin as efficient and stable as the haemoglobin packed in the red
blood cells. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#91:1>
A better understanding of the structure of haemoglobin has
been of help in this respect.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#92:1>
In fact, haemoglobin has been the first human protein whose
structure, and functions have been worked out to the finest details.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#93:1>
Not only that, the genes responsible for its production have been
identified, separated and duplicated into many copies too.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#94:1>
The haemoglobin protein is a tetramer-a molecule made up of two
units each of two different peptides called <it> <foreign> alpha </foreign>
</it> and <it> <foreign> beta </foreign> </it> chains.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#95:1>
The complete sequence of the amino acids that make up the <it>
<foreign> alpha </foreign> </it> chain and of the chain of 146 amino acids in
the <it> <foreign> beta </foreign> </it> peptide are now part of every
biology text book.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#96:1>
The sequences have been worked out to such a fine detail that the
sickle cell anemia - - a genetic disorder wherein the red blood cells do not
have the usual discshape and so carry very less oxygen - - is known to be
caused by a change in just one single amino acid in the chain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#97:1>
The change is due to a mutation, again a change in just one
nucleotide in the entire sequence of nucleotides on the DNA coding for the
haemoglobin peptides.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#98:1>
The haemoglobin structure is dynamic, in the sense that it can
change its shape as the oxygen binds to it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#99:1>
Thus when one molecule of oxygen binds to haemoglobin, the
structure is so modified that three more oxygen molecules can combine with
it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#100:1>
It is also associated with another chemical known as 2, 3, - 
disphosphoglycerate ( 2, 4 DPG ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#101:1>
When free and outside the cell haemoglobin lacks the 2, 3-DPG
because of which the tetramer structure breaks up into two <it> <foreign>
alpha-beta </foreign> </it> dimers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#102:1>
Though these dimers can bind to oxygen, they can also be excreted
easily out through kidneys.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#103:1>
The net effect is a lack of oxygen in the blood.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#104:1>
Therefore efforts have been made to modify free haemoglobin
chemically so that it remains stable as a tetramer, can pick up oxygen easily
and lingers longer in the body without being thrown out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-037#105:1>
The tetrameric structure of free haemoglobin can be stabilized
and even aggregated into large polymers, when because of its sheer size
kidneys are unable to filter it out.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#106:1>
However, such modifications also make the haemoglobin containing
fluid more vis-matched <O> <&> page </&> 44 </O> are produced using
chemicals like glutar-aldehyde which react with the amino acid groups on the
two different dimers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#107:1>
But such modified haemoglobin can not be stored for long as the
aldehyde linkage rearrange themselves changing the reactivity of
haemoglobin in an unpredictable way.

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#108:1>
But chemicals such as dextran and polyethylene glycol when joined
with haemoglobin retain its structure longer. </p> <&> in the box on page 44,

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#109:1>

<ICE-IND:W2B-037#110:1>
