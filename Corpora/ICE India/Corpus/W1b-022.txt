I had registered for it on 5th April 1982 of which the

attached to this cover. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#17:1>
After enquiring for several times orally in the Deepa
Gas Agencies it  
was told that still they have no order from the office to
distribute the  
regulator. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#18:1>
Now also when enquired same answer is given. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#19:1>
Previously we were staying in joint family and I had
no much  
difficulty but since now we are staying seperately, we are
very badly in the  
need of gas connection as I have small kids and I am working
as the head  
mistress of Oriental English <w> Academy's </w> highschool at

Sir, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#29:1>
With reference to your circular No. dt. 21.8.94 on
the subject  
noted above, I would like to submit my research project for
favourable  
consideration of the board. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#30:1>
According to the existing syllabus the subject
English is a  
compulsory one right from the Std. V to the graduation level. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#31:1>
However, the teaching of English has posed many
problems, at the  
primary, secondary, higher secondary as also at the graduation
level. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#32:1>
Being a teacher of English I have given thought to
some of these  
problems and have selected a topic " problems of Teaching of
English in the  
<}> <-> moffsil </-> <+> moffusil </+> </}> area under
Kolhapur district for  
research work. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#33:1>
I have discussed the topic with a renowned University
Prof., namely  
Dr. S.V. Shastri, who was the head of the department of
English of Shivaji  
University at Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#34:1>
He has accepted my request and agreed to be my guide
for my research

I enclose here with a copy of synopsis of my
research work, which  
would give a complete idea of the project. </p> 
 
<p>

I therefore request that my application may be
considered  
favourably and my research may please be accepted under the

Sir, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#49:1>
We have already registered for a new phone
connection on 26th  
June, 1995 by paying Rs. 800/- in the office ( receipt
No.142). 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#50:1>
But by regular process to get the telephone
connection, it will take  
<}> <-> the enough of </-> <+> more </+> </}> time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#51:1>
As ours is a public oriented organisation and for the
convenience of  
the communication, we find it very necessary to have the
telephone in the  
School as early as possible. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#52:1>
At present, there are more than 500 students in the
school and the  
school is situated in the extension area of Rajarampuri. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#53:1>
The most convenient thing for the communication will
be telephone  
itself. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#54:1>
I request you to consider this application very
kindly and  
arrange to issue the connection for our school as early as
possible. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#55:1>
We are ready to pay whatever extra charges are
necessary for the  
same. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#56:1>
Please let us know about it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#167:1>
After repeatedly telling you about not allowing
girls to go in  
the shops for any purchase it is noticed that you are allowing
grown up girls  
to go. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-022#168:1>
This should be immediately stopped. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-022#169:1>
