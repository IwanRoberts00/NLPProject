<h> <bold> The Future Of English In India </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#2:1>
English, as the language of the British, came to India with them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#3:1>
The Englishmen came to India and stayed <}> <-> here on </-> <+> on
here </+> </}> as the rulers till they were driven out of India by the <}>
<-> non-voilent </-> <+> non-violent </+> </}> fight started by Mahatma
Gandhi.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#4:1>
Nearly four decades after we have won freedom, we still continue with
English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#5:1>
It has been given a place in the schedule of languages under <del> con
</del> the constitution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#6:1>
In the constitution, Hindi has been given the status of National
language, but has allowed English to be an associate language.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#7:1>
English has been more popular <del> in </del> than Hindi in many
Southern and eastern states of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#8:1>
They find English more comfortable and easier language for
communication.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#9:1>
There is doubt that <del> wheter </del> whether English will go away
or would continue for a long period in India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#10:1>
Many Hindi favouring people say that when we have driven out
Englishmen from our country there is no meaning in carrying on our activities
in every field in English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#11:1>
Hindi is said to be spoken by majority of the people in India so it
should replace English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#12:1>
And those who <del> s </del> oppose Hindi say that not Hindi but its
sub-languages ( dialects) are in common use.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#13:1>
The <}> <-> arguement </-> <+> argument </+> </}> still goes on, that
if Hindi is used instead of English, the southern region will be adversely
affected.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#14:1>
As the people can't understand and speak Hindi well, English is given
<}> <-> prominance </-> <+> prominence </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#15:1>
This controversy raises the question of the future of English in
India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#16:1>
Many feel that English must continue here.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#17:1>
Today even an illiterate person is able to understand some English
words.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#18:1>
It has been the most popular language all over and is still a
powerful language.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#19:1>
Today there are many nursery schools and convents started which give
the education in the medium of English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#20:1>
These schools have <}> <-> sprang </-> <+> sprung </+> </}> up almost
in every city of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#21:1>
Also more and more people are trying to give their children the best
school needed for <}> <-> his </-> <+> their </+> </}> education.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#22:1>
Today even the poorest or lowest man like servants etc.<+> , </+>
want their children to be grown up as a convent student.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#23:1>
<del> Whatever </del> Irrespective of the cost he has to pay f <del>
r </del> or <del> his </del> the <w> child's </w> progress, he is ready to
pay.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#24:1>
The significance of English is growing day by day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#25:1>
English has a greater influence than any other foreign language
in India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#26:1>
We have switched <}> <-> upto </-> <+> on to </+> </}> English as it
is universally spoken and understood in almost all parts of the world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#27:1>
On the contrary French and Chinese languages are also equally
prominent in <del> an </del> the world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#28:1>
Many say that why only English ?

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#29:1>
We can take up French or Chinese <del> also </del> too.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#30:1>
But this is highly impossible for a nation to give up English totally
and adopt another associate language.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#31:1>
For this we require good French teachers or Chinese teachers who can
teach us efficiently.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#32:1>
Then we also have to <del> see th </del> take a look on the
constitution and its laws.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#33:1>
<del> wh </del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#34:1>
As the laws are amended in English language, we would have to
translate all those in French or Chinese.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#35:1>
And to do all this work is of no use.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#36:1>
It will just create a chaos and mess.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#37:1>
Like the statement ( Proverb) <quote> " A bird in hand, is worth two
in the bush." </quote> <del> And </del> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#38:1>
Nowadays, all the scientists, physicians, mathematicians, <}>
<-> experimentors </-> <+> experimenter </+> etc. <+> , </+> across the world
have taken English, as their language of study.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#39:1>
All these books are written or printed in English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#40:1>
So to read and understand the scientific <del> al </del> ,
technological development and their views and ideas we have to stick <-> up
</-> to English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#41:1>
Today, in India many books and newspapers are also published in the
master language ( English).

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#42:1>
As <quote> " Rome was not built in a day", </quote> adopting a second
language is dangerous, ( impossible) because <quote> " Prevention is better
than cure." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#43:1>
It is wise to continue with English. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#44:1>
Every year the international conferences and meetings, <del>
which </del> are held with different nations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#45:1>
These countries have a language of their own.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#46:1>
It is difficult for one to converse with another in <w> one's </w>
own ( national) language.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#47:1>
In such cases, English comes in use.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#48:1>
As mentioned above <-> that </-> many people can speak and understand
English through the world, English is found to be a language of significance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#49:1>
And if exceptionally someone sepaks in <w> one's </w> own national
language and <w> other's </w> can't understand.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#50:1>
The speech given out by the speaker is translated into English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#51:1>
They prefer English to be translated as it is not possible for <del>
every </del> one to translate in many languages & hence English plays a
dominating role. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#52:1>
This is a <}> <-> controvercy </-> <+> controversy </+> </}>
which will continue many many hereafter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#53:1>
It is just a wastage of time.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#54:1>
<del> di </del> English, as a matter of fact is a very important,
interesting and a wonderful language.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#55:1>
This has been agreed by many writers, thinkers & scholars.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#56:1>
Chakraborthy Raj Gopalacharya also said the same. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#57:1>
English has done a great deal of work in the progress and
development of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#58:1>
The British are responsible for this because they brought this
language ( Masters Language) to India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#59:1>
<del> Al </del> And it proved to be of a great help to Indians.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#60:1>
But they did so for their own interest.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#61:1>
The first school in English was started in 1817 by <del> A </del>
David Hair.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#62:1>
Then English spread its arms wider & wider, and has come to this
stage and proved to <+> be </+> dominating. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#63:1>
There is no doubt about <quote> ` The Future of English In India'
</quote> will be bright.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#64:1>
The only thing is that the Indians must try and come forward to
accept English.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#65:1>
It will continue for many more decades or may be centuries. </p> </I>


<I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#66:2>
<h> <ul> Should <}> <-> mother's </-> <+> mothers </+> </}> go to
work </ul> ? </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#67:2>
In early period, there was no too much importance to education of
<}> <-> woman, </-> <+> women, </+> </}> or girls.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#68:2>
<}> <-> Womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> are not more educated.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#69:2>
They had many restrictions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#70:2>
<}> <-> Man's </-> <+> men </+> </}> do not want to give education to
<}> <-> woman's </-> <+> women </+> </}> & send them for work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#71:2>
<}> <-> Woman's </-> <+> Women </+> </}> <+> were </+> asked to do
only the house-hold work just as servant of home.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#72:2>
It is our tradition that <}> <-> woman's </-> <+> women </+> </}>
work at home & <}> <-> men's </-> <+> men </+> </}> went outside to earn
money. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#73:2>
But after independance, importance for <w> woman's </w> education
is increased.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#74:2>
Mahatma Phule also started school for <}> <-> woman </-> <+> women
</+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#75:2>
There was a great development of <}> <-> woman </-> <+> women </+>
</}> in all fields of science, technology.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#76:2>
Now, there is no work which can perform only by <w> man's </w> but it
is impossible for woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#77:2>
Every woman has to play various <}> <-> role </-> <+> roles </+>
</}> such as sister, mother, wife, daughter in her life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#78:2>
But in all roles her <w> mother's </w> role is very important.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#79:2>
Our religion considered woman as very powerful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#80:2>
There are various examples which proved that they are very
intelligent, brave, like men's <-> men </-> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#81:2>
such as Rani Lakhsmibai, Rani Rupmati, in early period, Indira
Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu in later period.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#82:2>
These <}> <-> woman's </-> <+> women </+> </}> devoted themselves for
development of country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#83:2>
But they do not forget their duty in personal life like mother,
sister, wife etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#84:2>
They do these duties very efficiently & successfully.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#85:2>
Now, at present, we find <}> <-> woman </-> <+> women </+> </}> in
all <}> <-> field </-> <+> fields </+> </}> of education, science,
technology, army, arts, painting, designing, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#86:2>
In all these <}> <-> field </-> <+> fields </+> </}> they show their
skill, intelligence power etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#87:2>
They went for service everywhere in their day to-day life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#88:2>
Now, the question arises <quote> ` Should <}> <-> mother's </->
<+> mothers </+> </}> go to work' </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#89:2>
I think it is very difficult to answer this question.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#90:2>
As there are two <}> <-> side </-> <+> sides </+> </}> of answer in
this question.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#91:2>
One side is that in modern age, <}> <-> woman's </-> <+> women </+>
</}> are very educated.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#92:2>
So they do not want to stay at home.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#93:2>
They want to make something creative according to their ability &
which suited to their personality.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#94:2>
Population is also goes on increasing, needs of people <}> <->
increases </-> <+> increase </+> </}> so prices of <}> <-> good </-> <+>
goods </+> & services reached their maximum level.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#95:2>
Therefore, generally, in all houses both husband & wife are working
to earn more money & to satisfy their needs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#96:2>
Young boys commands educated girls who are in service for <}> <->
merriage </-> <+> marriage </+> </}> & educated girls also want to make their
careers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#97:2>
All these points are correct from point of view of modern girls &
boys but when she became a mother of her child she must concentrate her mind
to look after her child.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#98:2>
Because it is the time when she had to develop her child who <+> will
</+> <}> <-> became </-> <+> become </+> </}> a leader of this great nation
of tomorrow.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#99:2>
If at this stage <}> <-> children's </-> <+> children </+> </}> are
neglected, there may be bad effects on innocent mind of children. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#100:2>
In modern age, <}> <-> mother's </-> <+> mothers </+> </}> <}>
<-> went </-> <+> go </+> </}> for work by leaving their small baby in hands
of servant.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#101:2>
Then she remains out of work normally for whole day & keep busy in
her routine work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#102:2>
Father of child had also no time to look after him.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#103:2>
So she <}> <-> do </-> <+> does </+> </}> not know <}> <-> wheather
</-> <+> whether </+> </}> the servant takes proper care of child or not.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#104:2>
I think every child till he reaches age of 12 years wants the
need of his mother in every work at all time <-> for </-> - e.g home-work,
discussing certain matters like gathering, competition etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#105:2>
If <}> <-> mother's </-> <+> mothers </+> </}> go to work then after
returning to home they get very tired.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#106:2>
So they become upset & depressed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#107:2>
Instead of solving problems of children, they <}> <-> got </-> <+>
get </+> </}> angry towards them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#108:2>
And in above all <}> <-> scenens </-> <+> scenes </+> </}> no role
is assigned to father because he solve some difficulties but to certain
extent otherwise they also <}> <-> got </-> <+> get </+> </}> angry towards
them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#109:2>
It means need of mother in <w> children's </w> life cannot be filled
by father.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#110:2>
<}> <-> Children's </-> <+> Children </+> </}> are always <?>
threatened </?> of their father.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#111:2>
They can talk more freely with their mother instead of father in
each & every problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#112:2>
When a small baby <}> <-> began </-> <+> begins </+> </}> to cry you
have noticed that <}> <-> sometime </-> <+> sometimes </+> </}> father or any
other failed to make <+> him </+> <}> <-> quite </-> <+> quiet </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#113:2>
But when he goes in hands of his mother, he <del> became </del> <}>
<-> immediently quite </-> <+> immedietly quiet </+> </}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#114:2>
Then the question arises <}> <-> wheather </-> <+> whether </+>
</}> <quote> ` Should mothers go to work' </quote> or not.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#115:2>
Then for this question I want to say that mothers must go to work,
it is necessary to show their <}> <-> tilent </-> <+> talent </+> </}> ,
efficiency, intelligency in the development of nation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#116:2>
I don't want to say that <}> <-> mother's </-> <+> mothers </+> </}>
only maintain their house or to take care of their children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#117:2>
But when <}> <-> children's </-> <+> children </+> </}> reach at
their maturity level if financially <}> <-> abidility </-> <+> ability </+>
</}> permitted.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#118:2>
If financial position is poor then they must go to work but they
leave their small baby in hands of some <}> <-> responcible </-> <+>
responsible </+> </}> person to whom you trusts fully. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#119:2>
We must remember that India is also our mother & we have to make
India best in all services by serving & helping in the world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#120:2>
At present, many mothers may <}> <-> proved </-> <+> prove </+> </}>
as a good <}> <-> techer </-> <+> teacher </+> </}> or good army officer or
good justice or good doctors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#121:2>
They helped to a great extent to India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#122:2>
We must not forget their contribution to India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#123:2>
Some <-> of </-> <}> <-> womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> also became
a chief minister of some of Indian states today. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-001#124:2>
As per my <}> <-> openion </-> <+> opinion </+> </}> <}> <->
womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> or mothers must work outside & make their
career but they must not forget their duties in regard to home, children etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#125:2>
The <}> <-> primery </-> <+> primary </+> </}> duty of every mother
is to look after their children & to take care of their home.

<ICE-IND:W1A-001#126:2>
Because the need of mother from point of children can not <+> be
</+> filled by any person in the earth. </p> </I>
