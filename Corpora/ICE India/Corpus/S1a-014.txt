hostel life and didn't miss it but <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#7:1:B>
Here I miss <,> my friends in Hyderabad

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#8:1:A>
Don't you have friends here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#9:1:B>

have friends

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#10:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#16:1:A>
Okay fine did you go around Mysore <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#17:1:B>
Not much <,> uh you see <,> we have such busy schedules <w>
it's </w> so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and
then on <O> one word </O> so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#18:1:B>
Not much but okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#19:1:B>

I went to Chamundi Hills <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#23:1:A>
Okay it was nice <,,> and I joined here much later than you so <,,>
I think it takes some time to get used to my work also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#24:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#25:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#26:1:B>
Okay isn't it

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#27:1:B>
Quite challenging

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#28:1:A>
Well <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#29:1:B>
I do find it interesting I hope <w> you'll </w> also find it
interesting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#30:1:B>
What about this weekend <,> what are you planning to do <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#31:1:A>
Nothing as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#32:1:A>
Maybe I will go to city <,> see how it is <,> how life is here <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#33:1:B>
How about going to Ooty some day <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#34:1:A>
How far is it from here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#35:1:B>
Uh its <,> as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty
kilometres <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#36:1:A>
So how many hours it will take <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#37:1:B>
By bus <,> not more than six hours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#38:1:B>
It should be actually around four but since you have the mountain
routes and the <O> one word </O> it will come around <,> say not more than
<,> six <?> hours </?> <,> am I wrong <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#39:1:A>
I have no idea actually but uh <,> is the journey comfortable
by bus <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#40:1:B>
Or <,> I suppose the project people all of us could hire a
vehicle and go

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#41:1:A>
Would that uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#42:1:B>
Yeah <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#43:1:A>
Would that <,> be very nice

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#44:1:B>
I mean it depends on what <,,> uh all of us agree upon isn't
it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#45:1:A>
Yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#46:1:B>
Yeah and uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#47:1:A>
But before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and
go somewhere no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#48:1:A>
Spend some time outside atleast <,> away from your work <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#49:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#50:1:B>
Actually uh <,> this week I am going down to the <w> friend's </w>
place in <,> uh Bangalore <,,>

</w> be coming back around <,,> uh say Sunday <,> evening <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#52:1:B>
What about you

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#53:1:B>
What are you planning to do since <w> I'll </w> not be around <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#54:1:A>
Then <w> I'll </w> have to look for somebody else <,> because

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#56:1:B>
Have you ever been to Ooty <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#57:1:A>
I went when I was very young like a child almost <,> so I
don't remember anything clearly <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#58:1:B>
I went just uh <,> this year around June

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#59:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a <O> one word </O> place <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#60:1:A>
Yeah I heard so <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#61:1:B>
Yeah and I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#62:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a nice place for <{> <[> honeymoon couples </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#63:1:B>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#64:1:B>
Uh <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#65:1:B>
That is the main <w> you're </w> <O> one word </O> to go there <O>
laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#66:1:A>
So how do you find the difference from Hyderabad

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#67:1:A>
Do you find any different <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#68:1:A>
And you have been in Calcutta also <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#69:1:B>
Yeah <,> I loved Calcutta better than <,> say Mysore or
Hyderabad <w> that's </w> because <,> uh attachment to the family <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#70:1:A>
Not with the city <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#71:1:B>
Uh <w> it's </w> both <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#72:1:B>
<{> <[> <w> It's </w> attachment with the place </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#73:1:A>
<[> How do you find it there </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#74:1:A>
I found Calcutta very lively city

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#75:1:B>
Yeah <,> like which do you prefer

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#76:1:B>
<w> It's </w> Calcutta or Siligudi <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#77:1:A>
No I am basically from Calcutta so I would like to <,> uh stay
in Calcutta

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#78:1:B>
No but you spent most of your uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#79:1:A>
Actually <{> <[> when I was </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#80:1:B>
<[> You were in </[> </{> Siligudi isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#81:1:A>
Yeah but we were forced to stay in Siligudi because my parents
were working there

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#82:1:A>
But nobody actually liked the place much because <,> we used to
miss our home our friends <,> uh relatives everybody <,> because everybody
was in Calcutta

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#83:1:B>
But how many years uh <,> you were in Siligudi <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#84:1:A>
I was there after my birth I spend some <,> four five years in
Calcutta when I was in <,> uh Siligudi

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#85:1:B>
That means the entire span

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#86:1:A>
School life I spent there <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#87:1:B>
But still you have <,> no liking for the place

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#88:1:A>
I don't have really I found it a bit boring <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#89:1:B>
Is it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#90:1:A>
I like the place and the activities in Calcutta

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#91:1:A>
And Calcutta somehow <,> like <{> <[> wherever you go in India <w>
it's </w> different </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#92:1:B>
<[> Yeah I mean <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> city of joy </[>
</{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#93:1:A>
Yeah it is different <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#94:1:A>
You can do something or the other and keep yourself busy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#95:1:B>
Busy <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#96:1:A>
<w> That's </w> how it is <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#97:1:A>
Compare to that even Hyderabad I don't like so much

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#98:1:A>
But okay <,> in Hyderabad I had the friend circle

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#99:1:B>
Yeah <,> <{> <[> so <,> we slowly develop

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#100:1:A>
<[> So </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#101:1:A>
<O> A few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#102:1:A>
We could <,> make the place enjoyable <,,> well

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#103:1:B>
Did you watch the match on T V today <,> uh yesterday

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#104:1:A>
No I couldn't because I was still in the office <,,> and this
is what I miss <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#105:1:A>
I think I should get one <,> pocket radio or something <,,> <O>
laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#106:1:B>
But <w> it's </w> so disgusting everytime the team keeps
losing I mean <,> something should be done isn't it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#107:1:A>
There is <{> <[> something wrong over yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#108:1:B>
<[> Something is going wrong </[> </{> somewhere

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#109:1:A>
Something is wrong with the <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> Indian team
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#110:1:A>
I think they don't have that uh <,> team spirit or something

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#111:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#112:1:B>
Team spirit <w> that's </w> lacking <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#113:1:A>
Because uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#114:1:B>
I mean and <w> that's </w> why they keep losing

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#115:1:A>
Yeah initially <{> <[> we had </[> problem with uh <,> they
had problem with all the captains like <,> when Kapil was the captain they
had problems

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#116:1:B>
<[> Very badly </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#117:1:B>
They had

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#118:1:A>
Then other <,> who became the captain they had problems <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#119:1:A>
Now they can't possibly blame Tendulkar because he is doing a very
good job

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#120:1:B>
Very good job <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#121:1:A>
But still <w> they're </w> losing <,> there must be something
wrong with them <,,> like whole team

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#122:1:B>
<w> It's </w> high time <,> all of them got together and did
something about it instead of losing each and every match <{> <[> and </[>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#123:1:B>
We just look forward to those eleven to do something for that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#124:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#125:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#126:1:A>
So you are interested in cricket also

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#127:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#128:1:A>
What else <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#129:1:B>
Uh <,> I haven't played cricket really in the formal sense
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#130:1:B>
In college we had a ground where <,> sometimes we used to put on
gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#131:1:B>
In fact the right pose I mean the boy used to carry the bat also
was never <,> taught <,> but okay we picked up on our own

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#132:1:B>
But I uh <,> play <,,> Tennis and uh <,> Badminton I love the game
<,> so <,,> it just goes on <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#133:1:A>
And what about uh <,> books and music and how do you keep
yourself busy <,> in leisure time

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#134:1:B>
I read lots of books <,> only English <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#135:1:A>
You know both the languages <,> you have uh <,> edge like
<,,> uh you know Telugu and Bangla both

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#136:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#137:1:A>
So which books you prefer reading <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#138:1:B>
Telugu and Bangla <,> I am more comfortable in Bangla

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#139:1:B>
Frankly speaking I haven't read any book in Telugu

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#140:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#141:1:B>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#142:1:A>
So <,> even the Telugu very <,> famous poems are coming out
now on

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#143:1:B>
I <?> know </?> never <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#144:1:A>
You have a very famous uh feminist <,> poet <,> like
Jayprabha and all <,> so you haven't gone through <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#145:1:B>
No I haven't <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#146:1:B>
I have gone through but I didn't understand <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#147:1:A>
I see <,> somehow I read some of the translated poems of
Jayprabha and I like them a lot

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#148:1:B>
Yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went
through it in Telugu

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#149:1:A>
True

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#150:1:B>
Because <,> my vocabulary is only the <,> limited and the
<,,> coloquial sort of what you call <,> how much of vocabulary can you get
at home <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#151:1:A>
I understand <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#152:1:B>
Outside it was entirely different <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#153:1:B>
No I didn't <,> really pick up the language as such <,> but I can
converse and <{> <[> like that </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#154:1:A>
<[> So when </[> </{> you write to your parents which
language you write in <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#155:1:B>
To my father English <,> to my mother <,,> Telugu <,> to my
grandparents Telugu <,> aunt Telugu

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#156:1:A>
So you know the written variety of Telugu also <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#157:1:B>
The written varieties I write down what I speak <,> that
should not be <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#158:1:A>
But don't you find any difference between the <,,> okay
letter writing would be uh <,> would have a different style like <,,> it
won't be exactly spoken variety <,> of a language

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#159:1:B>
That I have picked up to some extent with the replies I keep
getting from whoever <{> <[> I had written </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#160:1:A>
<[> Did you ever </[> </{> had <,> paper on Telugu <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#161:1:B>
No <,> actually <O> two words </O> have in M A <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#162:1:A>
Till your M A <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#163:1:B>
So with my <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#164:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#165:1:B>
I <O> two words </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#166:1:A>
So don't you find it very <,,> uhm different like <,,> you
being a Telugu uh <,,> using another language and more comfortable in another
language which is not your mother tongue

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#167:1:A>
So how do you feel

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#168:1:A>
How do you take it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#169:1:B>
Uh <,> actually uh <,,> some thing more like <O> one word
</O> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#170:1:B>
Uh I <,> haven't thought about this

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#171:1:B>
Actually from childhood only I was brought up in the same
atmosphere <,> like if Papa still has shifted to another place I would have
got the feeling of <,> not having comfortable in a particular language but on
the whole I think it doesn't matter exactly <,> how we go about chosing or
selecting a language <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#172:1:A>
So you are really an Indian <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#173:1:B>
Thank you <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#174:1:B>
What about today evening <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#175:1:A>
Okay we might go somewhere no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#176:1:A>
Because if sitting here and uh <,> I think <,> <{> <[> yeah <,>
doing nothing is very boring

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#177:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#178:1:B>
You are really getting boring <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> and uh as
far as when I haven't yet started my work <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#179:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#180:1:A>
Even I haven't because I just joined <,,> and I have to know
like what exactly I am supposed to do

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#181:1:A>
I have got an idea but uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#182:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#183:1:B>
No but that is uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#184:1:A>
Even uh okay even after office hours <,> like no what else
<,> <{> <[> <w> that's </w> true <,> and so we can go somewhere else

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#185:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> true </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#186:1:B>
Make the evening enjoyable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#187:1:B>
So we can go somewhere to eat <,> how do you <,> <{> <[> perhaps
<,> like it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#188:1:A>
<[> Perhaps </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#189:1:A>
Uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#190:1:B>
I am thinking about <,> but only <,> certain things <,> I
mean not all the time <,> so

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#191:1:A>
Okay I am <O> one word </O> to some extent

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#192:1:B>
We are usually blamed because <,> people say the girl is <,>
uh <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#193:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#194:1:B>
Don't talk about like this <O> laughs </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#195:1:B>
<w> It's </w> just food and food and food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#196:1:B>
Seventy-five percent of <?> fair </?> income is spent on food

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#197:1:A>
But don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in <,>
uh Hyderabad University who used to say like <,,> uh for breakfast you should
come to south <,> and for uh <,> lunch okay you can go anywhere but the
snacks you should go to Calcutta <O> laughs </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#198:1:A>
Because I think she not only <?> came </?> there <,> you can't get
any where else

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#199:1:B>
No I remember <,> <?> novels </?> and the <?> chalks </?> <,>
see you don't get it anywhere <,> <{> <[> no <,> else <,> beside say West
Bengal in general

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#200:1:A>
<[> No </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#201:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#202:1:A>
And famous <indig> rasgulla </indig> of course

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#203:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#204:1:A>
You can't get it anywhere else <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#205:1:B>
I don't think <O> laughs </O> <{> <[> there is any </[>
person who would have not tasted it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#206:1:B>
Are you crazy for sweet <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#207:1:A>
<[> I know <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#208:1:A>
Not exactly but uh <,,> Calcutta sweets I think they do have
a little flavour <,> and that I haven't got anywhere in India

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#209:1:B>
Yeah <w> that's </w> it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#210:1:B>
But I tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#211:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> actually <,> I actually go for good food <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#212:1:A>
I don't like quantity but <,> quality should be there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#213:1:B>
Yeah <,> <O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#214:1:A>
So whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations I
don't mind <,> but it should be <,,> tasting good

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#215:1:B>
Yeah tasty

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#216:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what matter <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#217:1:A>
<{> <[> But here </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#218:1:B>
<[> Do you have </[> </{> Chinese food <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#219:1:A>
Yeah I enjoy it <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#220:1:B>
Uh <O> a few words </O> so lousy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#221:1:A>
It was not Chinese <,> because the Chinese they never put
sugar in Chao min <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#222:1:B>
Yes sugar in Chao min <,> they put tomato

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#223:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#224:1:B>
I mean <,> I could have made a better preparation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#225:1:A>
<w> That's </w> not a Chinese preparation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#226:1:A>
Half of the people don't know how to cook <{> <[> them no </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#227:1:B>
<[> Don't know </[> </{> how to cook

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#228:1:A>
And you should go <{> <[> to a typical </[> Chinese
restaurant

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#229:1:B>
<[> But why so that </[> </{> you have lots of these Chinese
restaurants in Calcutta while <,> its comparatively less <,> <{> <[> less <,>
in <,> Mysore or even in Hyderabad why <{> <[> is it so </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#230:1:A>
<[> Less </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#231:1:A>
<[> I do have </[> </{> a feeling that in south specially <,>
the people <,> uh do go for <,> their food preparation <,> mostly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#232:1:B>
No <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#233:1:A>
I haven't seen people uh <,> going for other dishes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#234:1:B>
No <,> and I think another reason is <,> the percentage of
people who spent money on <{> <[> outside eating </[> is comparatively less
<,> <{> <[> on restaurant <,> than in the north <,> in general <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-014#235:1:B>
Even I suppose the Punjabis and uh <,> the Gujratis also <,,> do
go in for all this stuff

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#236:1:A>
<[> On restaurant </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#237:1:A>
<[> Less </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-014#238:1:A>
Yeah they do <,> </I>
