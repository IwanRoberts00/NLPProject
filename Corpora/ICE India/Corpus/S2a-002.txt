<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#1:1:A>
A very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the
Karnatak State Billiards Association match for <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#2:1:A>
The last and final session of the <,,> world under twenty-one <,,>
snooker championship <,,> is about to commence <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#3:1:A>
And the man you see on your screens is Ronie <w> O'Salavan </w> of
England <,> fifteen year old <,> who has established a dominating <,,> nine
frames to four <,> uhm <,,> lead in this finals <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#4:1:A>
<w> It's </w> the best of twenty-one <,> so <,,> he has to win just
two more frames <,> to win <,> the world under twenty-one <,> <}> <-> <.>
snoo </.> </-> <=> snooker </=> </}> crown <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#5:1:A>
His opponent who you see on your screen now is Patrick <,> Yelston
of Belgium <,> sixteen years old <,,> who <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}>
uh <,,> amazed everyone with his <,> tremendous sporting ability <,,> and is
<-> is </-> <+> in </+> </}> happy <,> temperament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#6:1:A>
Ronie Salavan <,,> on the first session of this match which was held
yesterday <,> just managed to <,,> get into a four frame to three lead <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#7:1:A>
But this morning in the <,> second session of the match <,> he was
virtually unstoppable <,> winning <,,> four out of the five frames that <}>
<-> was was </-> <,> <=> were </=> </}> played <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#8:1:A>
And the centre piece of this morning session <,> was a marvellous
break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance <,> except for the black
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#9:1:A>
Uh <,> that <,> what you saw that <,> was a mis clue for Ronie <w>
O'Salavan </w> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#10:1:A>
And <,> uh he is uhm <,,> <}> <-> <w> it's </w> <w> it's </w> a bit
</-> <=> <w> it's </w> a bit </=> </}> humid out there although <,> the air
conditioning is on in the hall

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#11:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a bit humid and possibly <,,> uh that was the <,>
reason for <,,> that mis cue <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#12:1:A>
Now <w> let's </w> see here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#13:1:A>
His opponent does <,,> well his opponent hasn't done much in fact
<w> he's </w> left <,,> the red hanging over the <,,> corner pockets <,,> the
left corner pocket on your screen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#14:1:A>
The black is clear <,> so if Salavan <,,> can put this <,,> with a
ton of <,> stunt <,> which he has done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#15:1:A>
He can set himself up for a useful opening break <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#16:1:A>
<w> There's </w> a contrast in styles between these two players
with <,> <w> O'Salavan </w> <,> uhm certainly I would say the more gifted of
the two <,> also being <,> the more thoughtful of the two

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#17:1:A>
And I think that that is the right approach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#18:1:A>
Snooker is not a game which you can really <,,> uh play with any
degree of carelessness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#19:1:A>
You can play of course but you have to be careful <,> and I think
this is the difference between <,> Ronie Salavan <,,> and his <,> Belgium
opponent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#20:1:A>
Certain loose reds open <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#21:1:A>
And uh <,> <w> O'Salavan </w> <,> can <,> take a heavy toll of his
<w> opponent's </w> <,> careless safety shot <,,> <O> cough </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#22:1:B>
Wondering if there is plant on after us <,,> black which is
going to Salavan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#23:1:B>
A plant is <,,> a shot <,,> where you <,,> pick the first rid hit
it on to the second rid <,,> and make second rid travel into the pocket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#24:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a charge <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#25:1:B>
That was a beautiful shot <,,> <O> applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#26:1:B>
He brought out the pink <,,> and <,,> he has now sink it in the
centre pocket and come <,,> back towards this end of the table <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#27:1:B>
And position for any of the open rids <,,> on the right hand <,>
right hand side of the screen that is <,,> the one <w> he's </w> come for now
is next to the pink spot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#28:1:A>
From where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as
if that red <,,> his might not be free <,,> or <,,> yes <}> <-> it is </->
<=> it is </=> </}> free <,,> only it doesn't look like <,> from this angle
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#29:1:A>
And <w> here's </w> his chance to put the blue and <,,> turn it
into the cluster of edge to open them up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#30:1:A>
<w> That's </w> not exactly what he had intended <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#31:1:A>
But <,,> I think may be useful forty-five break

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#32:1:A>
Perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#33:1:A>
Sending the ball towards the bob cushion <,,> <O> applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#34:1:A>
So <,> <w> that's </w> got to Ronie Salavan with a <,,> good break
of forty-five <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#35:1:B>
Nothing to play except safer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#36:1:B>
<w> It's </w> the <O> one word </O> shot <,> extraordinary and
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#37:1:A>
Uhm <w> that's </w> the kind of thing that <,,> Yelston who
want to avoid <,> if he has any hope of <,> getting back into this match <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#38:1:A>
Cannot afford to play careless shots and open up <,> the edge to an
opponents <w> who's </w> playing in a good form <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#39:1:A>
Will you agree with that Arvind ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#40:1:B>
Definitely but at the moment the way he <,> has <,> played
that rid <,> it might have been a shot to nothing shot <,> whether he <,>
took a wild swing

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#41:1:B>
He has gone back to the bottom of the table <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#42:1:B>
So he may not have just a intellect to pot it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#43:1:B>
He might have intended to pot it as well as <,> end up towards the
bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#44:1:B>
Anyway <,,> a shot that is being played now by <,,> Salavan leaves
him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#45:1:B>
And now <,> this will show whether the young man is going for his
<,,> game or whether <w> he's </w> going to be <}> <-> play </-> <=> playing
</=> </}> <?> KG </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#46:1:B>
He can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the
brown <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#47:1:B>
<w> He's </w> slumped didn't had a good follower <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#48:1:B>
He knows <,> that though his opponent has got <,,> forty points
ahead and <,> may be he can possibly make up his by <,> sneaking <,> <{> <[>
well <,> few points <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#49:1:A>
<[> Well </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#50:1:A>
That was a very good shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#51:1:A>
But <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#52:1:B>
His intention in that particular shot was to play it with a
lot of left hand spin to take the ball <,> off the cushion closer to the blue
so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#53:1:B>
But <,> he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to
react <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#54:1:B>
Anyway <,> he did a marvellous job in that uh <,> clean pot on the
blue ball <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#55:1:B>
He just landed it <}> <-> in </-> <=> into </=> </}> the bottom
pocket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#56:1:B>
He is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#57:1:B>
May be worry of uh <,> his waist coat or his <,> sleeve touching
the yellow <,,> he played that in very much of hurry and missed it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#58:1:B>
And <w> that's </w> the first decent uh <,> opening <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#59:1:B>
Salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he
should have easily <,> potted that rid <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#60:1:B>
Uh <,> now the <}> <-> <.> Bel </.> </-> <=> Belgium </=> </}>
player definitely <,,> should <,> level scores or go further because all the
reds are <,,> in a position that he can manoveur them open <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#61:1:B>
And he has <,,> opened out one red <,> comfortably <,,> except that
he has to play it with the rest because he might <,> not be able to reach it
being a left hander <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#62:1:B>
There again he went to playing with the <,,> rest with his right
hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to <,,> play his uh <,>
a <,> inactive pots <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#63:1:B>
Going for the pink ball <,,> clean as a whistle <,> follows without
those two reds <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#64:1:B>
Now left on with the red <,> in the centre <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#65:1:B>
Very well done <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#66:1:B>
Perfectly in position for the pink <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#67:1:B>
A soft stunt loosen the <,> a red into the corner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#68:1:B>
Perfectly in position for the black <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#69:1:B>
And this is uh <,> said for certain viewers viewing this game <,>
on your black and white screens <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#70:1:B>
A frame which should have uh <,,> for all practical purposes <,>
gone to Ronie Salavan <,,> is now coming back <,,> towards the Belgium <,,>
player <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#71:1:B>
<w> There's </w> no place for the black ball to be spotted on his
own spot

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#72:1:B>
The red is occupying the black spots uh <,,> <w> blacks' </w> area
<,> and as such <,,> is been <,> the black still spotted on the yellow spot
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#73:1:B>
Now beautiful shot there and he is <,,> right in possession for
that ball <,,> <O> applause </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#74:1:B>
Break of thirty-five which puts him five <,> points ahead of uh <,>
<w> Ronie's </w> <,,> score <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#75:1:B>
Uh ah <,> <O> applause </O> beautiful shot <,> he played well for
remaining position for the blue <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#76:1:B>
He might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up
comfortably <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#77:1:B>
That was a <,,> very hard shot that he played on the black but the
ball didn't really <,> travel as much as he wanted to <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#78:1:B>
<w> He's </w> done a damn <,> good practice of <,> play that <,,>
damn good shot on that actually <,> he could have uh <,,> this was a careless
shot because he couldn't reach <,> and he played a haphazard shot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#79:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a pity that after that <,,> I think that that he
should have played this shot over reaching with the rest <,> and giving
Salavan a chance <,,> to uh <,,> get back straight away <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#80:1:A>
Of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the <,,>
cushion <,> the bob cushion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#81:1:A>
And uh <,> it will require some effort to <,,> to pot it in
position <,,> uh correctly for the green <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#82:1:A>
Well I think Salavan has done quite well to get where he is <,> and
he can stun it off the bob cushion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#83:1:A>
And <w> I'm </w> sure that <,,> Yelston must be kicking himself
right there because <,,> he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#84:1:A>
Now this is a crunch ball <,> the green <,> he can get this <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#85:1:B>
It has come a little too much <,> for Salavan has to use the
wrist <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#86:1:A>
One point behind <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#87:1:B>
Yes indeed <,,> <O> applause </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#88:1:A>
Ronie Salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match
over as quickly as possible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#89:1:A>
So <w> he's </w> now gone into the lead <,,> by three points <,,>
he needs the blue and the pink <,,> to wrap up the frame <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#90:1:A>
Oh <w> that's </w> it <,,> <O> applause </O> before two frames of
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone <w> O'Salavans'
</w> way

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#91:1:A>
<w> He's </w> now <,> just one frame away <,> from winning <,> the
under twenty-one world snooker championship <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#92:1:A>
And uh there you see Yelston <,,> with his <,,> left hand over his
eyes

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#93:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> sure <w> he's </w> rueing that <,,> rather dreadful
safety shot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#94:1:A>
Uh <,,> looking a bit dejected <,,> but <,> <w> that's </w> only to
be expected

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#95:1:A>
If he had <,,> to have any sort of chance of getting back into this
match <,> it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so <,> that <,> as we said before
<,,> that hasty <,,> shot <,,> cost him the frame <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#96:1:A>
Well he is off some of the <,,> yes and now beautiful <,> first our
view of the whole <,,> arena <,,> very handsome arena <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#97:1:A>
The Karnataka State Billiards Association is very fortunate in
having its own premises <,,> and having such a <,,> wonderful match room <,,>
where the scores of the famous <,> <w> that's </w> been played <,> in the
final <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#98:1:B>
First sessions score <,> as you can see on the board <,,>
thirty-nine sixty-two <,,> loosing the first frame <,,> and uh <,>
subsequently <,,> twenty-four seventy three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#99:1:B>
The scores actually <,> are the other way round <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#100:1:B>
Uh some of them have gone <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#101:1:A>
Yes <w> there's </w> the scores are quite right because it
was <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#102:1:B>
No the scores

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#103:1:A>
Yeah you are right you are right <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#104:1:A>
First two frames were taken by Yelston <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#105:1:B>
<w> Yesterday's </w> score <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#106:1:A>
<w> Yesterday's </w> score <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#107:1:B>
Not <w> todays' </w> first <w> sessions' </w> but <w>
yesterday's </w> <,,> and then it was uh <,> Salavan <,,> who got that got
the <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#108:1:A>
Yelston has just broken up for <,,> the <,,> fifteenth frame
of the match <,> and <,,> should he loose this of course <,,> young Ronie
fifteen year old Ronie <w> O'Salavan </w> <,,> will be the <,,> nineteen
ninety-one <,> world under twenty-one snooker champion <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#109:1:B>
Feels extremely the pity but uh <,,> there is an applause
that brilliant shot on the last but one red <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#110:1:B>
Fouled uh <,> spoiled his <,> safety shot <,,> and <,,> what could
have been very interesting match is now going to be <,,> possibly <,,>
Salavans <,,> uh very easy manner now that the fight is <,> obviously out of
Yelston <,,> <O> applause </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#111:1:A>
He has <?> tied </?> our <?> equation </?> and and it is
great but as such

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#112:1:B>
No doubt about it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#113:1:A>
Now <w> let's </w> see what what he does <,> I mean he is
quite remarkable this man <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#114:1:A>
For his adolescent as I should call him being sixteen years old
<,,> sixteen years of age <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#115:1:B>
Looking for the plant <,,> and <,,> trying to slam it now
this was the shot which uh <,,> if played a little carefully <,,> could have
uh <,> brought him back very much into the game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#116:1:B>
But the way he <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> <,,> burst the
back <,,> <w> he's </w> still not run left Ronie a little easy <,> on this
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#117:1:B>
<w> He's </w> lost the black alright <,,> and if Ronie goes for
this <,> last set of the screen on your left hand side as you see or the <,,>
one level black spot the second one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#118:1:B>
<w> That's </w> the one I mean and <,,> <w> he's </w> got it well
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#119:1:B>
If he gets that now that <w> he's </w> got this <,> a colour <,>
bringing him back up the table <,,> will probably <,,> put that to <,,> any
sort of a challenge that <,> the Belgian might have <,,> had in mind <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#120:1:A>
With all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a
Christmas tree <,> and uh <,,> here <w> O'Salavan </w> <,> his now in a in a
difficult position because <w> he's </w> right on the cushion <,,> and <w>
he's </w> attempting a slice <,> which he has got in fact <,,> and uh <,,>
this must be uh well

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#121:1:B>
<O> Two words </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#122:1:A>
So not much damage done <,,> uh from <w> Yelston's </w> point
of view <,,> uh as a result of that <,> wide slash that he took at the red
<,,> <O> applause </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#123:1:B>
Round of applause for getting himself out of that self
imposed snooker <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#124:1:B>
Ronie <w> O'Salavan </w> five <,,> Patrick Yelston <,> six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#125:1:B>
And as I said before <w> O'Salavan </w> needing just <,> this
frame <,,> to win <,,> the title <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#126:1:B>
Now well <,> planned safety shot but <,> he got the edge on
that rid <,> still didn't uh <,,> remain in the centre area <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#127:1:B>
However the long pot was won and <,,> it was played well by <,,>
Patrick Yelston <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#128:1:B>
This is again an opening from which the Belgian can <,,> make <,,>
a good number of points <,> that depends whether he can <,,> muster up all
the guts that are required to face a situation like this <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#129:1:A>
Provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do
something silly <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#130:1:B>
You know <w> it's </w> uh <,,> is quite possible because <w>
you've </w> seen him break down on the easiest of shots <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#131:1:B>
This is the longest that he has <}> <-> <.> take </.> </-> <,> <=>
taken </=> </}> to plan a break if you noticed Mike <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#132:1:A>
Yes <,,> same stroke that strike me I must confess <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#133:1:A>
First time <w> we've </w> seen him <,> thinking <,,> so much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-002#134:1:A>
Uh <,> this is just <,> just he stress at that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-002#135:1:B>
Actually what happens when a person is a very fast player
<,,> tries to think and play a slow game <,,>
