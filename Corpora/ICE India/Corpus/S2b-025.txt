<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X1:1:A>
Graham Greene <,> recently celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X2:1:A>
He can now look back on a career in writing <,> which has covered  
over sixty years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X3:1:A>
This programme <,> pays homage to Graham Greene <,> whom many critics  
regard as the finest author <,,> never to have won the nobel prize for  
literature <,,> </&> </X> 
 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#4:1:A>
In order to <,> understand what a writer or a poet is about  
<,,> it is most important to know something <,> about his background and his  
life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#5:1:A>
Graham Greene was born <,> on the second of October nineteen hundred  
and four <,> at Birkamstate <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#6:1:A>
Uh his father was the headmaster of Birkamstate school 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#7:1:A>
And that is where Graham Greene did his earlier education <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#8:1:A>
He won a scholarship to go to Belliol College Oxford <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#9:1:A>
And it was at Oxford that he first started writing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#10:1:A>
Uh his first <,> work was a collection of poems called <mention>  
Babling April </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#11:1:A>
Soon after he left <,> Belliol he converted to Catholicism <,,>  
married a catholic lady <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#12:1:A>
The marriage wasn't very successful and <,> it ended in a divorce  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#13:1:A>
Uh Greene went through a very long period of extreme depression  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#14:1:A>
He continued writing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#15:1:A>
He wrote three novels 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#16:1:A>
None of them <,> which he rated very high <,> and although they  
were published he later <,> disclaimed having done them and refused to allow  
them to be <,> reprinted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#17:1:A>
He worked for a time <,> in the <mention> Times of London  
</mention> and <mention> The Spectator </mention> and did a lot of journalism  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#18:1:A>
And then he began his travels <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#19:1:A>
He travelled extensively <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#20:1:A>
He is one of the most widely travelled <,> authors <,> uh in the  
world today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#21:1:A>
Uh he went specifically to look for material <,> for his books <,>  
he stayed a long time got to know the people <,> and got whatever he wanted  
for his novels <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#22:1:A>
Uh his first successful book only in terms of uh <,> sales was  
<mention> Istanbul Train </mention> <,> uh based on the Orient Express <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#23:1:A>
It wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#24:1:A>
He got recognised and was taken a little more seriously <,> then he  
had been with his first three novels <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#25:1:A>
Then followed a veritable <,> flood of books <,> and of all kinds  
<,> books of poetry <,> books of travel adventure detective stories essays  
<,> <w> childern's </w> books <,> you name them and Graham Greene was writing  
them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#26:1:A>
Uh it <,> really in the sheer output <,> it is hard to <,> find  
anyone who did such a vast range of writing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#27:1:A>
Therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on  
him <,> because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think  
of <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#28:1:A>
However uh three or four of his books were really taken very  
seriously <,> and uh <,,> one can see in those <,> uh novels <,> uh  
particularly the ones I will mention later <,> were some kind of his  
philosophy of life comes through <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#29:1:A>
Now <,> what kind of <,> uh belief did <,> Graham Greene have <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#30:1:A>
As I said before he is a Catholic <,,> but in politics he was  
pretty close to being a communist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#31:1:A>
He is an extremely extreme leftist <,> uh knew and admired people  
like Fidel Castro of Cuba <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#32:1:A>
Uh he was denied a passport <,> uh a visa <,> to the United States  
because of his leftists leanings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#33:1:A>
It was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#34:1:A>
He <,> is <,> convinced in his writings that you cannot really make  
black and white decisions <,> or black and white distinctions <,> there is a  
vast grey area <,> uh which really has more truth in it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#35:1:A>
In his first volume of his autobiography called <mention> A sort of  
life </mention> <,> which he <,> uh wrote in nineteen seventy-one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#36:1:A>
He <,> talks of what he calls an epigraph <,> to his earlier novels  
and quotes <,> Bishop <w> Bagrum's </w> apology <,> and goes something like  
this <,> <quote> Our interests are on the dangerous edge of things <,,> our  
interest are on the dangerous edge of things <,,> the honest thief <,,> the  
tender murderer <,,> the superstitious atheist </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#37:1:A>
Now you can see the contradiction in terms here <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#38:1:A>
And in the second volume he makes it even clear 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#39:1:A>
The second volume being known as <mention> The ways of escape  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#40:1:A>
He talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#41:1:A>
So you can see that there was no <,,> distinct <,> line <,> between  
right and wrong <,> goodness and badness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#42:1:A>
While I was looking through <,> uh uh notes <,> <-> making </->  
preparing on Graham Greene to talk about him <,> I was struck by a strange  
coincidence <,,> that he was born on the second of October <,> which also  
happens to be Mahatma <w> Gandhi's </w> birthday <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#43:1:A>
Uh I don't believe in astrology <,> but I was very curious to know  
<,> if <,> there was anything in common <,> between these two men <,> as is  
maintained by astrologers that people born under the same <,,> combination of  
stars <,> have similar careers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#44:1:A>
Now obviously there wasn't really a <,> to the outword eye very  
much in common <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#45:1:A>
Uh Gandhi was a devout Hindu <,> a pacifist <,> who only wrote  
because he wanted to convey his message <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#46:1:A>
Greeen on the other hand was an Englishman a Catholic <,> and his  
primary interest was writing <,> not <,> a mission that he like Gandhi had  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#47:1:A>
But there was one thing very <,> common between the two <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#48:1:A>
Both were deeply concerned <,,> with the lowest of the lowly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#49:1:A>
<w> Gandhiji's </w> interest was with <indig> harijans </indig> <,>  
landless peasantry <,> and those who had been indiscriminated against <,> in  
<,> his own country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#50:1:A>
He didn't bother about rest of the world very much <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#51:1:A>
He travelled very little <,> apart from his <,> studies in England  
and this <,> couple of years he spent in <,> South Africa as a lawyer <,> and  
then once as the member of the round table conference this uh <,>  
representing the <mention> Congress party </mention> <,> <-> all his travel  
was </-> rest of his travel was in India <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#52:1:A>
Graham Greene hardly ever lived in England his native country and  
he was travelling all the time <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#53:1:A>
But while Gandhiji looked to the poor in his country Graham Greene  
was most concerned with drop outs <-> in </-> of society in all parts of the  
world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#54:1:A>
His main characters are <,> uh thieves robbers <,,> uh
drug-pedlars <,> the scum of society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#55:1:A>
Now the other thing <,> uh where the two <,> have some kind of  
contrast <,,> Gandhiji believed in the innate goodness of man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#56:1:A>
He believed that there is something fundamentally good in every  
person <,> and if it appealed to <,> uh the man could be changed completely  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#57:1:A>
Now Greene was not so naive <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#58:1:A>
He does not believe in the innate goodness of man <,> he believed  
that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the <,> best of  
us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#59:1:A>
And he was closer to the reality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#60:1:A>
Third thing which uh <,> is of interest <,> is that uh <,,> both  
were concerned with the struggle <,,> between good and evil <,> uh the  
eternal battle between right and wrong <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#61:1:A>
Gandhiji <,> uh being devoutly religious uh <}> <-> belief </-> <+>  
believed </+> </}> that ultimately <,> goodness always triumphs over evil <,>  
<indig> Satyamev Jayate </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#62:1:A>
Now again <,> Greene was not so naive to believe that uh <,> the  
good always triumphs over <,> bad <,> that uh <,> truthfulness always scored  
<,> over evil because he <,> saw that many times <,,> <-> people </-> good  
people suffered <,> and evil people prospered <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#63:1:A>
Uh I think these were the things that I think one should bear in  
mind when comparing <,> the careers of these two people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#64:1:A>
Now I come to <,> some of his books to illustrate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#65:1:A>
I think the three best known <,> uh and most seriously taken by  
critics <,> are <mention> Brighten Rock </mention> <,,> is one and <mention>  
Power and the Glory </mention> is another one <,> and <mention> Heart of the  
Matter </mention> <,> is the third 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#66:1:A>
I think they are the three most outstanding works of Graham Greene  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#67:1:A>
Now <mention> Brighten Rock </mention> concerns itself <,> with the  
career of a young delinquent <,> a catholic <,> Pinky <,,> his one ambition  
in life is to get the better of Olioni <,> a bigger racketier who has made a  
lot of money <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#68:1:A>
Uh Pinky has a catholic girl friend called Rose <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#69:1:A>
He is a drunkard 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#70:1:A>
He is a violent man <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#71:1:A>
And in the process of trying to become <,> the leader of the gang  
<,> he kills an innocent journalist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#72:1:A>
Then he picks up the young protestant girl <,> Ida <,> and they  
have an affair for a long time <,> and Ida ultimately <,> really brings him  
to justice and he is <,> <-> taken </-> <,> arrested <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#73:1:A>
Here you see <,> although Greene was a catholic and his main  
character Pinky is a catholic <,> uh the person who betrays him but for the  
goodness <,> for the right cause so that justice is done <,> is a girl of  
loose morals <,> a protestant <,> girl called Ida <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#74:1:A>
You see this even in <,,> more <,> uh clarity in the <,> what I  
think is probably is very best novel <,> <mention> The Power and the Glory  
</mention> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#75:1:A>
This is set in Mexico <,,> at the time of uh <,> severe persecution  
by the state <,> of the catholic church <,> uh the police were hunting <,>  
for uh <,> catholic priests <,> murdering them bringing them <,> putting them  
in jails <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#76:1:A>
And here we have two characters <,> uh catholic priest <,> one is a  
drunkard <,> uh he has a mistress he sired a bastard child through her <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#77:1:A>
The other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#78:1:A>
So <,> both in that sense have defied <,> with the basic tenets of  
catholicism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#79:1:A>
And they are on the run <,> from the police <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#80:1:A>
This priest who <,> has uh <,> sired a bastard child and is  
drunkard <,> is <,> successfully getting out of the country in just as he is  
coming close to the border and to freedom <,> he gets a message that a poor  
peasant <,> catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to  
be performed <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#81:1:A>
He takes the risk of turning back <,> to go and perform the last  
sacraments <,> is caught and executed <,,> uh by a police man who is also a  
good man but he wants to do justice <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#82:1:A>
Here you see the mixture of characters uh <,> catholic priest  
drunkard <,> uh siring illegitimate children and yet when it comes <,> to the  
final test <,> atleast giving up his life and becoming a martyr <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#83:1:A>
And the third novel <,> uh <mention> Heart of the Matter </mention>  
<,> it is set in <,> West Africa <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#84:1:A>
Here we have a character <,> uh deputy commissioner of police uh  
Scobie <,> who is a good upright man <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#85:1:A>
Uh he has a rather eccentric wife Louise <,> who dabbles in writing  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#86:1:A>
Uh he has a lady friend a young <,> widow called Helen <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#87:1:A>
And it is going on alright till <,,> slowly he begins to uh <,> get  
caught in a whole plot <,> where a innocent journalist is murdered <,,> and  
Scobie <,> in trying to investigate <,> is uh <,> laid up wrong <,> making  
wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#88:1:A>
Uh Scobie also is a catholic and <,> suicide is a sin by the  
catholic church <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#89:1:A>
And here once again clearly <,> you see the dichotomy <,> the  
conflict between good and evil <,> between belief <,> faith <,,> and uh  
reason <,> and the <,,> way <,> Greene mixes these characters <,> is  
absolutely masterly <,,> <X> <&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X90:1:A>
Graham Greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected  
English writer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X91:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X92:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-eight <,> he received the British film  
institute award for his services to the cinema <,,> that he has not yet been  
awarded the nobel prize for literature <,> is a puzzle to most people outside  
the British Academy <,> </&> <X> <X> <&> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X93:1:A>
People have asked why hasn't he <,> been given the nobel prize for  
literature the greatest award <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X94:1:A>
Well the answer I think is pretty simple <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X95:1:A>
Uh Greene is essentially <,> a story teller in the <}> <-> <.> Mau  
</.> </-> <=> Somerset <w> Maugham's </w> </=> </}> tradition <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X96:1:A>
Uh not one of his description really <,> rises above straight  
writing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X97:1:A>
He hasn't got the <,> turn up phrase <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X98:1:A>
He is really a <,> master craftsman only in as much <,> that his  
writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses <,>  
nothing embellished <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X99:1:A>
And perhaps the <,> people who decide on these things are more  
impressive with smart <,> writing turn up phrase <,> memorable description  
<,> or sometime the philosophy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-025#X100:1:A>
As far as philosophy is concerned <,> Graham Greene is far too  
subtle <,> uh for people of <,> who form the decision making body <,> of the  
nobel prize committee <,,> </&> </X> </I>
