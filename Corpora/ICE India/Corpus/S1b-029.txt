<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#1:1:A>
A few weeks ago <,,> we didn't know about plague <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#2:1:A>
Now <w> it's </w> here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#3:1:A>
We don't know whether <w> it's </w> here to stay <,> or going to
vanish <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#4:1:A>
What I learnt <,> and most of us <,,> here today learnt <,> that
this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six <,> but it has resurfaced after
twenty-eight years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#5:1:A>
<}> <-> Most of </-> <,> <=> most people </=> </}> of my generation
today think <,> that <,,> it had <,,> just <,> occured way back <,> in <,,>
at the end of the last century <,> and over twelve point five million people
had died <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#6:1:A>
But now it is again here

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#7:1:A>
There is total confusion

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#8:1:A>
<w> It's </w> spreading <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#9:1:A>
There is panic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#10:1:A>
<w> We've </w> a panel of <,,> eminent doctors here today to
discuss <,> the cause <,> and the cure

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#11:1:A>
To know whether it is going to <,,> stay or <,,> be controlled <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#12:1:A>
Now let me introduce the panel to you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#13:1:A>
To the extreme left <,> is Dr B Chakravarty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#14:1:A>
He is medical suprintendent of the Safdar Jung hospital here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#15:1:A>
Next to him <,> is Dr Ashok Rattan <,> from the All India Institute
of Medical Sciences <,> and just next to me is Dr K K Dutta <,> Director of
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#16:1:A>
Now <,> <w> we'll </w> like to know from Dr Dutta <,,> that <,>
this disease <,> we everybody thought that it has been eradicated <,> how it
has come back <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#17:1:B>
Actually <,> plague <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> known to
be associated uh with uh <,,> epidemic <,> not only epidemic <,> <O> two word
</O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#18:1:B>
So the plague means epidemic <,> plague means <O> one word </O>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#19:1:B>
It is not true that uh <w> we've </w> been able to eradicate plague
<,> uh though the last human case of plague <}> <-> is in nineteen </-> <=>
in India is nineteen </=> </}> fifty-six <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#20:1:B>
But what <w> we've </w> told that you know after nineteen fifty-six
we <,> we don't have a evidence <,> I mean confirmed evidence of human plague
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#21:1:B>
But <w> we've </w> uh the evidence of uh <,> rodent inflicting
disease <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#22:1:B>
To know that the <?> rats </?> were <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#23:1:B>
Now one of the importance <O> one word </O> which covered safety
<,> in Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Karnataka <,> <O> a few words </O>
because <O> two words </O> see adjoining areas anymore <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#24:1:B>
Another important focus is Maharashtra <,> another <O> one word
</O> Himachal Pradesh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#25:1:B>
You know we had focus site in in Madhya Pradesh <,> uhm uhm and
some other areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#26:1:B>
But basically <,> <O> a few words </O> is existing <,> in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#27:1:B>
It continues to live in India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#28:1:B>
And plague is known to come <,> <?> inside </?>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#29:1:B>
And how <,,> what is the <.> e </.> <O> one word </O> period what
is there you know it could be in decade <,> it could be few years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#30:1:B>
And nobody knows exactly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#31:1:B>
And not only it resurfaced in India it has resurfaced in many other
countries also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#32:1:B>
As <w> I'm </w> <O> one word </O> even in nineteen ninety-two was
this organisation has reported plague <,> human plague from nine countries

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#33:1:A>
So is it here to <,,> stay now ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#34:1:A>
<}> <-> What do you </-> <=> what do <,> the <?> N I C </?> </=>
</}> say ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#35:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> not say that it is going to stay <,> because the
human plague uh would be definitely brought under control <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#36:1:B>
And uh <,> once the human plague is <?> in district </?> occurred
<,> it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the
situation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#37:1:B>
We know that <w> we've </w> uh a plague surveillance in the
National Institute of Communicable Disease at Bangalore <,> which insisted
there is some <?> violence </?> I don't know if they control measure for
plague <}> <-> in the </-> <,> <=> in the </=> </}> adjoining cities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#38:1:B>
We had another even if they uh uhm <,> I mean uhm I <O> a few words
</O> one unit was working in Maharashtra <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#39:1:B>
Uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#40:1:B>
Though uh <,> from the National Institute of Communicable Disease
we can see the focal point for uh <,> plague uh <,> monitoring <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#41:1:B>
<w> We've </w> warned actually <,> <w> we've </w> told them that
the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#42:1:B>
It was also recomended <,,> the last <,> uh inter-state
co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#43:1:B>
I strongly remember <?> sell </?> when it was sell that the plague
<?> contrareversal </?> contra repulsion of the <O> a few words </O> because
if you said <O> a few words </O> we do not know <,> what is happening in the
<,> in the <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#44:1:B>
Because uh we don't have any picture <,> uh uh what is happening uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#45:1:A>
But did we know that uh it has <,> it can occur in India ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#46:1:B>
Yes <,> because the plague is known to occur in cycle <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#47:1:B>
As <w> we've </w> been

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#48:1:A>
No because you see <,> when we first heard from date <,> that
was on September fourteenth

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#49:1:A>
And four plague cases were detected in Beed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#50:1:A>
It was dismissed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#51:1:A>
In the respective states government said it is not <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#52:1:A>
Even N I C D said there was nothing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#53:1:A>
And all of a sudden some four five days later <,> we heard from
Surat <,> that people are dying there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#54:1:A>
People are running away <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#55:1:B>
<w> That's </w> not true

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#56:1:B>
<w> That's </w> not <O> one word </O> communicable disease actually
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#57:1:B>
Confirmed to the <,> the organisation of plague in Beed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#58:1:B>
Actually the <,,> the first uh the the reported thing of of the
clinical <,> <O> one word </O> which occurred in <O> one word </O> <,> that
was on twenty-sixth of August <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#59:1:B>
Then <w> they've </w> you know the delegates of this planning of
Beed district <,> then they approached the local medical college

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#60:1:B>
They came <,,> they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a
case of plague <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#61:1:B>
They saw the cases

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#62:1:B>
They collected some critical material <O> a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#63:1:B>
They collected uh some rat also which was sent to the Haffkin
institute <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#64:1:B>
And and the local medical college <,> they declared <w> it's </w>
not a case of plague <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#65:1:B>
But thesis continue to to <,> uh to occur <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#66:1:B>
And not only that the rat fall also continued to occur <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#67:1:B>
Then uh <,> uhm they asked our help <,> then they actually I got a
telephonic message from from uhm uhm from <,> joined director of <O> two
words </O> <,> on second of September <,> that uh they want uh <,> one
assistant in where in understanding the problem

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#68:1:A>
And that they detected as early as September <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#69:1:B>
So second September immedietly I requested them you send the
<,> some of sample which <w> you've </w> collected

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#70:1:B>
They suspected four cases <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#71:1:B>
They collected four set of samples <,> and has been

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#72:1:A>
Uh uh how did that <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#73:1:B>
So that I kept the <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#74:1:B>
We told them that the uh it is uh you send uh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#75:1:B>
We informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#76:1:B>
And immediately they started distributing the contraband <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#77:1:B>
But in the Beed <O> one word </O> what has happened they took very
good anti-plague measure <,> then uh then <O> one word </O> exchange house
to house salvage

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#78:1:B>
So the situation was coming under control <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#79:1:B>
But unfortunately <,> there is something you know which occured you
know first confirmation it came to us <,> it was on twentieth of September

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#80:1:B>
<w> We've </w> some couple of cases and I

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#81:1:A>
Excuse me Dr Dutta

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#82:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#83:1:A>
Can I ask you one question

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#84:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#85:1:A>
Have you has the <,,> frequent relation with an earthquake <,>
because it has occured about the earthquake <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#86:1:A>
Can you explain it <}> <-> <.> whe whe </.> </-> <=> whether </=>
</}> it has <O> one or two words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#87:1:B>
Actually you know when the last earthquake when this
earthquake occured in Latur <,> our investigative team <w> that's </w> not it
was only one team

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#88:1:B>
Our team went there

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#89:1:B>
We can held the <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#90:1:B>
And we made <}> <-> the a </-> <=> a </=> </}> forecast

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#91:1:B>
That forecast in the sense that we told them <,> that because this
particular their case is is unknown of <O> one word </O> focal

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#92:1:B>
There may be focal <O> one word </O> there

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#93:1:B>
Idea struck like focus was there <,> and now because of the
earthquake because of echo disturbence <w> that've </w> occured this <O> one
word </O> will start migrating in different directions <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#94:1:B>
So keep a watch on this

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#95:1:B>
And I would <w> we'll </w> not be surprised that we gain certainly

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#96:1:B>
But that is not there is rodant uh uh <,> plague and infections how
could in <O> few word </O> domestic area and human being affected

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#97:1:B>
We made them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#98:1:B>
Not only we told them in our report <,> we also published in in the
science section <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#99:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#100:1:C>
Should I try to put it in <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#101:1:A>
<[> Yeah doctor </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#102:1:C>
See uhm <,> plague is a disease of the rodant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#103:1:C>
And it is transmitted from rodant to <,> another rodant through
fleece <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#104:1:C>
Man is not required for <w> it's </w> transmission <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#105:1:C>
And uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are
present <,> uh in America <,> and they are present in U S S R <,> and they
are present in other country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#106:1:C>
And uh <w> it's </w> also <,> present in India

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#107:1:C>
So <w> it's </w> there that <,> man is not required for the
transmission <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#108:1:C>
<w> It's </w> uh a disease of the <,> rodant <,> which is carried
from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece <,> and <w> it's </w>
been there are some disturbances <,> when they fell over <w> it's </w> like
uh the milk boiling over <,> that the plague infects a man

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#109:1:A>
<indig> To aap ke kahne ka matlab hai ke <,> matlab jo khet
ka chuha hai <,> woh usse phailta hai </indig> <w> it's </w> not <indig> ke
aadmi aadmi se </indig> plague <indig> phailta hai </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#110:1:A>
What is it that we talk about <?> bubonic </?> plague ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#111:1:D>
So <w> that's </w> what <{> <[> I would like to </[> tell
about the

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#112:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#113:1:A>
Yeah Dr Rattan

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#114:1:D>
So what <,> Dr has told about is very correct <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#115:1:D>
It is basically <,> a disease of rodant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#116:1:D>
Man is an incidental <,> bit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#117:1:D>
But suppose a variety of <,> well uh this uh <,> disease have all
other <O> one word </O> a plague <,> suppose a <?> bubonic </?> type of
plague <,> where the <,> all the plague has occured uh which is uh <,>
develop <O> one word </O> <,> uh there is a fact <,> it has <?> larva </?>
and it has develop demand <,> at this time <,> man can <O> one word </O> into
the <O> one word </O> because by near about the drop in infection

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#118:1:D>
Becomes rather sick <,> so the bacteria are being stored <,> as a
support which it nearly get

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#119:1:D>
It is the beginning

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#120:1:A>
<indig> Matlab <,> matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar
chuhe ke hi </indig> state <indig> se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi
<,> agar usi ke </indig> state <indig> se use rok diya jaye <,> to </indig>
what <w> we're </w> facing today the <?> bubonic </?> plague which is the <,>
worst <,> among the three <,> plagues we hear about <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#121:1:A>
Can <,> can we prevent it ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#122:1:D>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#123:1:D>
You see what happens is <,> that from uh <,> from the rodant <,>
wild rodant they travel to liven rodant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#124:1:D>
Rodant which are nearer to domestic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#125:1:D>
So as uh Dr Dutta was mentioning about <O> one word </O> plate <,>
<O> one word </O> plate is in the wild uh <,> from the wild to liven rodant
which come in contact with human being <,> domestic rodant gets infection <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#126:1:D>
And from domestic rodant <,> we get infection <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#127:1:D>
Once it starts it could <,> stop only at debonic plague <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#128:1:D>
That means <,> we would in the envinal region <,> there are
swelling <,> or in the <O> one word </O> they are swelling <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#129:1:D>
And uh <,> it stops there in ninety percent of cases <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#130:1:D>
In about five to ten percent of cases <,> it goes on to the blood

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#131:1:D>
So it becomes ceptic in <w> it's </w> <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#132:1:D>
While only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#133:1:D>
It goes to the lungs <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#134:1:D>
Then it is infectious to man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#135:1:D>
Then it becomes a very dangerous plague <,> and it is infectious
from man to man

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#136:1:A>
<indig> Matlab jab chuha <,> khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko
hota hai

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#137:1:A>
Aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo </indig> fleece <indig> jo safed
hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat </indig> cases <indig> mei woh
niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#138:1:A>
Aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon
mei ajata hai aur baki jo </indig> worst cases <indig> hai jo </indig>
neumonic plague <indig> hum kahte hain jo aaj kal <,> Dilli mei bhi hai jaise
</indig> cases <indig> jo do huve hain kuch </indig> cases <indig> main woh
</indig> lungs <indig> mei chala jata hai aur hum thook se <,> matlab
baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh </indig>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#139:1:D>
<{> <[> <O> A few words </O> I would just tell </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#140:1:A>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#141:1:D>
Before we go into that <w> we'll </w> observe how <,> was the
clinical presentation of <,> <{> <[> yeah doctor <,> how does it produce <w>
that's </w> very important thing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#142:1:A>
<[> Yeah doctor </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#143:1:D>
So that will <w> we've </w> to do <O> one word </O> as he has
already told <,,> that uh <,> actually <,> it is it is this fleece which
bites a rodant <,> and that in this fleece have got the <O> one or two word
</O> out what and what to do <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#144:1:D>
So that when <w> they'll </w> bite <,> they were when lies on the
<,> uh ground or while walking in the <,> leg area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#145:1:D>
So it was dependent area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#146:1:D>
So it is found that <&> cough </&> if fleece bite <,> from there
it infection grows <,> and the <O> one word </O> period is there

<ICE-IND:S1B-029#147:1:D>
If there were two two <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#148:1:A>
Okay <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#149:1:D>
If <w> there're </w> two two <?> cases </?> <,> so the base
uh <,> whenever the first thing that this fleece sort of <O> one word </O>
<,> and other thing <,> and they doesn't doesn't divide your <O> one word
</O> group

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#150:1:A>
What is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you
<,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-029#151:1:D>
<w> It's </w> <,> well <w> it's </w> not very much noticed
about it because it is <,> uh it goes unnoticed <,>
