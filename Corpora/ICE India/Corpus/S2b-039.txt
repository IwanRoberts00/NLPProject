<ICE-IND:S2B-039#1:1:A>
Co-operation today <,> is an economic system <,> as a peaceful  
reaction against <,> capitalistic economy which has resulted <,> in the  
concentration of wealth <,> mass poverty <,> and decay of men <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#2:1:A>
Indian co-operative movement <,> is probably <,> the strongest <,>  
and the oldest movement <,> among developing countries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#3:1:A>
The co-operative movement <,> has been in existance <,> for more  
than eighty-five years <,> and would be hundred years old soon <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#4:1:A>
The movement <,> was introduced <,> with high hope <,> and big  
expectation <,> providing <,> a solution to <,> <w> India's </w> rural  
problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#5:1:A>
All the committees <,> from the times of Mr Nicolson <,> to this day  
<,> have constantly emphasised that <,,> the co-operative sector is a  
fundamental solution <,> to the ills of the rural economy in general <,> and  
agricultural economy in particular <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#6:1:A>
In the first few decades <,> the movement was <,> not a significant  
movement <,> but after Independence <,> due to <w> government's </w>  
encouragement <,> and the Reserve <w> Bank's </w> participation <,> the  
movement began to spread <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#7:1:A>
Since nineteen forty-seven <,> the number of societies <,> have  
increased from <,> one point eight <indig> lakhs </indig> <,> to about three  
point fifteen <indig> lakhs </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#8:1:A>
And the total membership <,> has also gone up from <,> one point  
thirty-seven <indig> crore </indig> <,> to fifteen <indig> crore </indig>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#9:1:A>
The co-operative sector <,> has provided <,> loan <,> to the extent  
of eight thousand <indig> crore </indig> <,> during eighty-nine ninety <,> as  
against <,> <indig> rupees </indig> six thousand <indig> crore </indig> <,>  
provided by the commercial banks <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#10:1:A>
The development of <mention> Consumer Store </mention> <,> and  
industrial co-operatives <,> has also been significant <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#11:1:A>
Thus <,> the co-operative sector in India <,> made a tremendous  
progress <,> in various directions and <,> has reached a stage when it can be  
said as an <,> important factor <,> in economic <,> social <,> and political  
development of India <,> and has now become <,> progressive and diversified  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#12:1:A>
National level <,> statutory organizations like <,> NABARD <,> L T  
D C <,> N D D <,> have been set up to promote <,> new co-operatives in India  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#13:1:A>
In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight <,> the co-operatives  
attended further heights <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#14:1:A>
Agricultural credit <,> disbursed <,> was around <indig> rupees  
</indig> three thousand five hundred <indig> crore </indig> <,> and the value  
of the credit marketed was <,> around <indig> rupees </indig> five thousand  
<indig> crore </indig> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#15:1:A>
The co-operatives <,> distributed <,> forty <indig> lakh </indig>  
tonnes of fertilizers <,> amounting <,> three thousand five hundred <indig>  
crore rupees </indig> <,> and <,> the co-operative sugar factories produced  
<,> fifty <indig> lakh </indig> tonnes of sugar <,> in nineteen eighty-seven  
eighty-eight <,> accounting <,> sixty percent national production <,> of  
sugar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#16:1:A>
Dairy development <,> and processing co-operatives also show <,>  
similar progress <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#17:1:A>
The experience <,> of number of successful co-operative  
organizations <,> like Amul in Gujarat <,,> <?> Marksade </?> in Punjab <,>  
Cooptex in Tamil Nadu <,> Apco in Andhra <,> sugar in Maharashtra <,>  
demonstrate that <,> co-operative sector has <,> needful energy to forge  
ahead <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#18:1:A>
There is thus <,> vast scope <,> for development of organized  
marketing <,> processing <,> and export activities <,> in the field of  
vegetables <,> flowers <,> horticultural products <,> forest produce <,,> and  
such other things <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#19:1:A>
Consumer Store <,> if managed honestly <,> and efficiently <,> can  
provide services to millions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#20:1:A>
Important achievement during the Seventh Plan was <,> a process of  
reorganization <,> of primary society to viable unit <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#21:1:A>
This process was <,> complete <,> in all the States <,> except  
Maharashtra <,> Gujarat <,> and Jammu <,> Kashmir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#22:1:A>
Another milestone <,> was the establishment of <,> NABARD <,> in  
July nineteen eighty-two <,> as an apex institution <,> to handle all matters  
relating to <,> planning <,> policy and operation <,> in the field of  
agriculture <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#23:1:A>
The Seventh Plan also laid down <,> great emphasis <,> on  
development of professional manpower also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#24:1:A>
All these efforts <,> brought <,> economic <,> social <,> political  
<,> and educational benefits <,> to the members of these societies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#25:1:A>
The economic benefits <,> include <quote> Providing of cheap credit  
<,> rescuing of rural farmer <,,> from the clutches of money-lenders <,>  
better use of credit <,> better prices to farmer <,> product <,> and better  
marketing facilities <,> to industrial worker </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#26:1:A>
On social side <,> idle men became industrial <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#27:1:A>
The spendthrift <,> the thrifty <,> the illiterate learnt reading  
<,> and some drunkard person reform their ways <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#28:1:A>
In short <,> co-operatives have become a tool of <,> self <,>  
aggrendisement <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#29:1:A>
Thus <,> the co-operatives made <,> great strides <,> and influence  
<,> all spheres <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#30:1:A>
However <,> there seem to have crept in <,> several distortions <,>  
on account of <,> various reasons <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#31:1:A>
Actually the movement was introduced to uplift <,> the downtrodden  
<,> and the small farmer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#32:1:A>
But in this respect <,> we find that <,> the movement has certainly  
failed <,> in achieving <,> these objectives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#33:1:A>
<mention> The rural credit survey committee </mention> <,> has  
rightly observed that <,> the slice of the co-operative finance <,> was  
eaten by <,> the big cultivator <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#34:1:A>
Thirteen percent of the total household <,> got <,> sixty percent  
share of the loan <,> while <,> fifty-three percent household <,> got eleven  
percent only <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#35:1:A>
Mr C Subramaniam <,> Governor of Maharashtra has rightly said <,>  
that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the  
weaker classes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#36:1:A>
On the contrary <,> the leaders <,> and the vested interests <,>  
had plagued the co-operative sector <,> thereby <,> the committed honest  
workers <,> are ousted <,> and driven out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#37:1:A>
For the poor performance <,> the number of causes are responsible  
<,> among them <foreign> lassez faire </foreign> policy <,> illiteracy <,>  
very small sized societies <,> undue reliance on honorary services <,>  
inefficiency in management <,> and partial coverage <,> of the life of the  
individual <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#38:1:A>
Extrinsic factors include <,> <quote> Widespread indebtedness <,>  
lack of business experience <,> uneconomic holding <,> price fluctuation <,>  
dearth of regulated market <,> old methods of cultivation </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#39:1:A>
Presently <,> the co-operative banking sector <,> faces the  
problems like overdue <,> <quote> Shortage of resources <,> indifferent  
management <,> and the lack of efforts <,> to mobilize deposits <,> untrained  
staff <,> and weak arrangement for linking credit <,> with marketing </quote>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#40:1:A>
In India <,> twenty-five percent of the societies <,> or say <,>  
thirty-four thousand societies <,> are defunct and dormant today <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#41:1:A>
This shows that <,> the co-operative movement in India <,> is not  
uniformly developed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#42:1:A>
<w> There's </w> marked <,,> regional disparity <,> and unevenness  
<,> in the growth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#43:1:A>
In Maharashtra <,> Punjab <,> Tamil Nadu <,> more than seventy  
percent <,> rural population has come <,> within the fold <,> while in Bihar  
<,> West Bengal <,> Assam and Orissa <,> the coverage is <,> below twenty  
percent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#44:1:A>
In Andhra <,> the development is restricted <,> to <,> to Telangana  
<,> or Railseema <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#45:1:A>
One of the most disquietning feature <,> in co-operative sector is  
<,> incidence of <,> increasing overdues <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#46:1:A>
In Maharashtra <,> alone <,> overdues amount to <indig> rupees  
</indig> two thousand four hundred <indig> crore </indig> <,> in nineteen  
eighty-seven <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#47:1:A>
In the past there were selfless and zealous workers <,> who devoted  
their whole life <,> as a mission <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#48:1:A>
But today <,> there is lack of dedicated leadership <,> and lack of  
trained personnel also <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#49:1:A>
The development is also hampered <,> due to <,> lack of  
inconsistant policy <,> and rigid approach <,> of the government <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#50:1:A>
The formation of large sized society <,> was rejected by the  
government <,> without giving it <,> a trial or a serious consideration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#51:1:A>
The defective loan policy <,> also stood <,> in a way of severe  
growth of the movement <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#52:1:A>
In most cases <,> the members of the society <,> do not understand  
<,> exact aims and objectives <,> of the co-operatives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#53:1:A>
The members therefore <,> have become <,> the clients of  
convenience <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#54:1:A>
This has laid to all kinds of <,> undesirable things in the  
management of the society <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#55:1:A>
Viewed in totality <,> our co-operative sector is not that  
impressive <,> and overall image is that <,> one of the major reasons for  
this <,> is that all initiative comes from <,> the government agencies <,>  
and not from the people <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#56:1:A>
It thus has lost its basic character <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#57:1:A>
Even today <,> the movement is known as <,> <indig> sarkari  
</indig> movement <,> and not the <indig> sahakari </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#58:1:A>
There are several apex institutions <,> which have no firm rule <,>  
and have a superstructure without infrastructure <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#59:1:A>
There is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship <,> both  
vertically and horizontally <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#60:1:A>
The sector therefore <,> cannot show its unified strength in the  
economy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#61:1:A>
There is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#62:1:A>
Federal units <,> like N C D C <,> NABARD <,> NAFED do not pay <,>  
sufficient attention to the constituent units <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#63:1:A>
<mention> National co-operative policy resolution of nineteen  
seventy-seven </mention> <,> relating to integreted approach has not yet been  
implemented <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#64:1:A>
Absence of such a policy has major limitation <,> which has created  
<,> several problems <,> in working of the co-operative sector <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#65:1:A>
There is thus <,> an immediate need for a clear government policy  
<,> for the co-operatives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#66:1:A>
Now <,> it is also quite necessary <,> to incorporate <,> role of  
co-operatives in <mention> Indian Constitution </mention> <,> so that <,> a  
clear prosperous future past <,> could be defined <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#67:1:A>
For the success of co-operatives <,> three elements are necessary  
<,> <mention> A dedicated leadership <,> professionally competent management  
<,> and enlighten membership </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#68:1:A>
After all <,> the co-operatives are owned <,> by members <,> and  
therefore <,> members should know what they really expect from the  
co-operatives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#69:1:A>
Awareness among the members <,> is very poor <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#70:1:A>
There is lack of <mention> Free membership training and education  
also </mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#71:1:A>
Leaders also have no clarity <,> about their role <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#72:1:A>
As the members of the co-operatives <,> or resource poor <,> in  
India <,> government provide finance but with some directives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#73:1:A>
Under such circumstances <,> how to restore member confidence <,>  
is the highest challenge facing us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#74:1:A>
And as a first step in this regards the government will have to  
loosen <,> its excessive control over the co-operatives <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#75:1:A>
Recently the issue of activization of democratic process <,>  
coupled with promotion <,> and professionalization of management <,> was  
discussed in <w> registrar's </w> meeting on twenty-sixth August nineteen  
eighty-five <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#76:1:A>
And according to recommendations <,> <mention> Ardhanarishvaran  
committee </mention> was set up in March nineteen eighty-six <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#77:1:A>
The committee in its recent report advised <,> to restrain <,> the  
tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#78:1:A>
Exclusive of <,> one or two recommendations <,> all other  
recommendations unless adopted expeditously <,> the movement cannot go  
further <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#79:1:A>
India is thus facing <,> a number of challenges <,> and in changing  
situations <,> the role of co-operatives <,> depend on <,> how swiftly  
co-operatives adopt <,> and reorient to these challenges <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#80:1:A>
Fortunately in Seventh Plan <,> adequate credit was made available  
to weaker section and less developed areas <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#81:1:A>
In Maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in  
rural areas <,> the co-operatives have diversified <,> into several  
subsectors <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#82:1:A>
Co-operatives now provide a full range of services <,> to village  
level farmer <,> in all respect <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#83:1:A>
So all these are good changes <,> yet <,> hereafter the poor  
sections <,> could be helped in <mention> income-generating </mention>  
activities <,> literacy programme <,> village sanitation <,> drinking water  
programme <,> vocational training programme <,> and community development  
activities <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#84:1:A>
Hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized <,> for  
weaker sections <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#85:1:A>
The members should be provided <,> training in general management  
along with <,> leadership development programmes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-039#86:1:A>
In short co-operatives should do <,> something for the community  
and then only <,> people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives  
<,,> </I>
