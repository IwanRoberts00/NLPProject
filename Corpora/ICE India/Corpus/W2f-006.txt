SHORT STORY

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#2:1>
SUNIL GANGOPADHYAY

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#3:1>
<h> A DAY LIKE A DREAM </h> <&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#4:1>
Sunil <w> Gangopadhyay's </w> famous short story, translated from
Bengali by Rina Nandy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#5:1>
From a forthcoming book of <w> Gangopadhyay's </w> stories to be
published by Penguin India. </p> </&> <O> drawing </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#6:1>
Strange questions invaded <w> Monolina's </w> mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#7:1>
She could say anything at any time without any reason.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#8:1>
It didn't take her even a moment to change the subject.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#9:1>
Because of this she seemed even more mysterious. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#10:1>
Subhro went with her for a walk beside the Ganga one day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#11:1>
There was not much of a crowd there at the time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#12:1>
Four or five romantic couples were scattered here and there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#13:1>
And a few lazy, middle-aged men, the sort one spots in parks and such
places all over the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#14:1>
Many benches were empty.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#15:1>
Yet not one met with <w> Monolina's </w> approval.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#16:1>
She passed several empty ones in the shade of beautiful trees but
refused to sit down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#17:1>
Subhro smiled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#18:1>
If you don't want to sit, we can walk about, he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#19:1>
I love walking in the sun. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#20:1>
Monolina asked, Have you ever walked in knee-deep mud? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#21:1>
Subhro replied, Of course.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#22:1>
Why shouldn't I? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#23:1>
When did you do it last?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#24:1>
Not in the kind of mud you find in the streets of Calcutta.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#25:1>
I am taking about knee-deep slush! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#26:1>
Subhro was mildly perplexed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#27:1>
It was difficult for him to say exactly when he had done so the last
time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#28:1>
He was reminded of his childhood.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#29:1>
He felt as a boy, gambolling in the mud beside some unknown river.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#30:1>
Seeing him take so long to reply, Monolina said, Forget it, you
don't have to answer the question. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#31:1>
I remember now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#32:1>
I had gone to the Sunderbans once.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#33:1>
Getting off the boat, there was a lot of slush.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#34:1>
I cut my foot on a broken shell. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#35:1>
How long ago was that? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#36:1>
Eight or nine years.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#37:1>
No, wait.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#38:1>
<w> Let's </w> calculate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#39:1>
Yes, it must have been 11 years back. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#40:1>
I must have been in a frock then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#41:1>
Monolina couldn't have been more than 20 or 21.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#42:1>
Subhro had touched 40.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#43:1>
Much of his hair had grayed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#44:1>
Seeing them together, no one would guess they were lovers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#45:1>
Maybe they were not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#46:1>
What about some coffee? Subhro asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#47:1>
I see the cafeteria is still open. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#48:1>
Without replying, Monolina asked, Do you know where I was born?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#49:1>
If you ask me, <w> I'll </w> tell you I was born on the road. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#50:1>
What do you mean? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#51:1>
Guess. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#52:1>
In a train?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#53:1>
Aboard a plain?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#54:1>
In a moving car? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#55:1>
No, none of these. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#56:1>
Where then?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#57:1>
This is a difficult question, I see? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#58:1>
I can even show you my birthplace.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#59:1>
It is actually a road. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#60:1>
Tell me the whole thing clearly! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#61:1>
We used to live in Dubrajpur then.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#62:1>
I mean my parents.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#63:1>
I was not even born then.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#64:1>
Theirs was a small and pretty one-storeyed house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#65:1>
A house that does not exist any more.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#66:1>
Instead, there is a road there now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#67:1>
Buses and trucks ply there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#68:1>
Monolina started laughing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#69:1>
Then, she flung down her books and said, Will you sit here? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#70:1>
Subhro said, No.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#71:1>
I can walk in the sun but I am not going to sit under it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#72:1>
Then what about sitting under the tree?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#73:1>
Monolina asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#74:1>
The main thing is I would like to sit on the grass, not on a bench.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#75:1>
Walking up to the tree, she didn't even sit down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#76:1>
She lay on the grass.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#77:1>
It was not very clean, of course.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#78:1>
Chewed sugarcane lay here and there - - and a few ice-cream cups.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#79:1>
Monolina did not even notice them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#80:1>
Subhro felt slightly uncomfortable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#81:1>
Passers-by would obviously stare at a young girl lying like that on
the grass.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#82:1>
But he decided not to dampen her enthusiasm. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#83:1>
Where were you when I was born? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#84:1>
After calculating a little, Subhro said, In England, in all
probability.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#85:1>
I went there to study when I was 19. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#86:1>
Were you there for long? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#87:1>
Almost 10 years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#88:1>
And where was I when you were born? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#89:1>
Subhro laughed.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#90:1>
He had never been asked such silly questions by any girl before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#91:1>
Where was Monolina when he was born! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#92:1>
Subhro said, Remember that poem by Rabindranath?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#93:1>
<X> <quote> " A wish has taken shape in the centre of my mind."
</quote> </X> Your name is also very significant from that angle! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#94:1>
Do you read poetry? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#95:1>
Why, aren't engineers supposed to read poetry?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#96:1>
I don't get time these days but I used to read a lot once upon a
time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#97:1>
Before leaving for England, didn't you fall in love with some
girl? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#98:1>
No. But I did immediately after reaching England! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#99:1>
Which means you first fell in love with an English woman? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#100:1>
No, it is not even that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#101:1>
I fell in love with a Bengali. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#102:1>
Hashidi? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#103:1>
No, I fell in love with Hashi after returning to my own country.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#104:1>
Then what about the girl you first fell in love with?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#105:1>
Did you not marry her or was it the other way around? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#106:1>
She didn't want to marry me.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#107:1>
In fact, she died suddenly one day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#108:1>
Do you remember her?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#109:1>
Do you remember her face? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#110:1>
Yes, I remember everything. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#111:1>
How old was she when she died? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#112:1>
She was about your age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#113:1>
<w> That's </w> the reason why I feel like dying.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#114:1>
I feel that if I die now, a lot of people will remember me for a
long time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#115:1>
Otherwise, I will turn old and stale one day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#116:1>
You are indeed a very strange girl! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#117:1>
Keeping quiet for a while, she suddenly tore off a fistful of
grass.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#118:1>
Stuffing it into <w> Subrho's </w> coat pocket she asked, Are you
angry with me for dragging you out like this? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#119:1>
Subrho said, No, why should I be angry?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#120:1>
I am <O> drawing </O> surprised perhaps.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#121:1>
But <w> that's </w> all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#122:1>
Surprise is a nice thing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#123:1>
I love surprising people. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#124:1>
One doesn't get easily surprised these days. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#125:1>
In life, we tend to get more angry than surprised.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#126:1>
Isn't that right?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#127:1>
But we don't like getting angry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#128:1>
We prefer to be surprised. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#129:1>
She explained this so beautifully that Subhro experienced an
intense physical happiness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#130:1>
He felt like caressing her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#131:1>
But in the afternoon, in such an open place, it did not seem quite
right.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#132:1>
Besides, he hardly knew her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#133:1>
They had met just a few days back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#134:1>
Even then, he stretched out and held her arm.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#135:1>
She did not pull it away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#136:1>
Instead, she gifted its exquisite warmth to him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#137:1>
And said, Why don't you lie down here? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#138:1>
Subhro raised his eyebrows, What!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#139:1>
Lie down here! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#140:1>
Yes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#141:1>
Why, don't you feel like doing so?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#142:1>
You look funny in your tie and coat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#143:1>
Take off your coat and bundle it up like a pillow! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#144:1>
Can I lie down in the open, just like that? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#145:1>
If anyone saw him there, <O> logo </O> basking in the afternoon
sun, they would have been taken aback.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#146:1>
After all, Subhrojyoti Sengupta was a very busy man.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#147:1>
After returning from England, he worked in a government office,
before starting his own firm.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#148:1>
The business had now spread, worldwide.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#149:1>
Even in Malaysia, they had done work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#150:1>
Subhro was dead serious as far as his business was concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#151:1>
Besides, he wasn't a mild natured man.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#152:1>
He never boozed nor womanized.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#153:1>
Had he wanted to enjoy women, there would have been no problem.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#154:1>
He travelled often and could have easily bought the pleasures of the
flesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#155:1>
But Subhro didn't want to.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#156:1>
He was satisfied with his marital life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#157:1>
He met Monolina only a few days back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#158:1>
She was a friend of his sister-in-law.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#159:1>
They had been introduced to each other at a reception. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#160:1>
The reception got over quite late.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#161:1>
His sister-in-law said, Subhroda, can you reach my friend home?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#162:1>
<w> It's </w> quite late and she would have to go alone otherwise
<*> dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#163:1>
Hashi did not attend the reception.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#164:1>
She had fever.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#165:1>
There were others in the car and Subhro had to reach them all home.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#166:1>
<w> Monolina's </w> house came last.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#167:1>
Even after reaching her there, they sat back and chatted for at
least half an hour.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#168:1>
Monolina addressed him familiarly at their very first meeting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#169:1>
Perhaps girls these days speak that way <*> dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#170:1>
Monolina said, You reached everyone home without speaking a
word. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#171:1>
Subhro answered hesitantly, Didn't I?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#172:1>
Of course I did! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#173:1>
That was politeness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#174:1>
Everybody thanked you - - and you, in turn, responded.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#175:1>
Were you thinking of something else?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#176:1>
Do you worry about work all the time? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#177:1>
According to Subhro, no one speaks this way after their first
introduction.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#178:1>
And she was just a young college-going girl while he, in comparison,
was a responsible, older man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#179:1>
Getting off the car that day, Monolina said, Because you smoke a
pipe, I have noticed your eyes close sometimes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#180:1>
Those who shut their eyes in front of others - - just to smoke their
pipes - - look very silly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#181:1>
Subhro didn't know if he should get angry or irritated.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#182:1>
Monolina said immediately thereafter, In future, try to keep your
eyes open.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#183:1>
You are not all that silly! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#184:1>
Subhro mentioned this to his younger sister-in-law.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#185:1>
Your friend is so strange! he complained.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#186:1>
She speaks in such a peculiar way <*> dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#187:1>
Joyita answered, Monolina?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#188:1>
A lot of people in our college say <w> she's </w> mad - - but I find
her a wonderful person.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#189:1>
Her heart is made of pure gold. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#190:1>
After a couple of days, Monolina dropped in at home.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#191:1>
In a few minutes, she became friends with Hashi.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#192:1>
Without a trace of self-consciousness, she walked into each room in
the house.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#193:1>
She straightened a crooked picture frame on a wall of <w> Subhro's
</w> room.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#194:1>
She drank three cups of tea.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#195:1>
But, as soon as she was asked to stay back for the TV film that
evening, she picked up her books and said, No, <w> I'll </w> push off now.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#196:1>
It wasn't clear as to why she visited them or why she left so
abruptly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#197:1>
After she went, it was noticed that she had forgotten her book. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#198:1>
She suddenly dropped in on Subhro in his office one day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#199:1>
As usual, he was busy at a board meeting.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#200:1>
Had it been anyone else, Subhro wouldn't have met the person.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#201:1>
After all, she was a young girl and a friend of his <w>
sister-in-law's </w> which made it impossible for him to ignore her
completely.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#202:1>
Keeping away some confidential papers on his desk, he sent for
Monolina and asked her what she wanted. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#203:1>
In a manner which suggested they knew each other for years,
Monolina said, I came to see your office.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#204:1>
One can't get to know a person after meeting him once at a
reception.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#205:1>
He must be a different person at home from what he is at office.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#206:1>
Subhro answered, Of course.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#207:1>
People change according to their circumstances.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#208:1>
What is so surprising about that? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#209:1>
Will you come out with me?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#210:1>
<w> We'll </w> go for a stroll besides the Ganga. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#211:1>
Subhro was shocked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#212:1>
He was snowed under by work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#213:1>
There were so many things to do at office that he could hardly
breath!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#214:1>
Since the firm did not belong to anyone else, Subhro couldn't even
think of dropping out once in a while.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#215:1>
It was his own company, after all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#216:1>
And, then, strolling beside the Ganga in the afternoon!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#217:1>
That was the prerogative of college students. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#218:1>
Subhro said, You feel like taking a stroll beside the Ganga <*>
dotted-line</*> with me?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#219:1>
Why?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#220:1>
Don't you have friends of your own? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#221:1>
Monolina replied, Why shouldn't I?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#222:1>
I go out with many others.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#223:1>
I feel like going out with you today.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#224:1>
Won't you come? </p> <O> logo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#225:1>
Subhro was about to say, No, this is an unreasonable request.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#226:1>
How can he leave all his urgent work and go for a stroll beside the
Ganga with this chit of a girl?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#227:1>
But Monolina looked at him with her sparkling innocent eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#228:1>
He felt as if he couldn't let her down, whatever may come. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#229:1>
So he quickly chalked out what could go wrong in breaking his
schedule for the day.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#230:1>
<w> Let's </w> see, what this girl wants of me, he thought, and left
everyone agog at the office and left.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#231:1>
Yes, Subhrojyoti Sengupta left his office at 3 in the afternoon with
a beautiful young girl. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#232:1>
Subhro asked, Are you feeling odd because <w> I'm </w> wearing
this tie?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#233:1>
If you want, <w> I'll </w> remove it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#234:1>
Monolina said, Are you embarrassed to lie down on the grass?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#235:1>
But, if you lie down, you will see so much more of the sky.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#236:1>
So few of us are privileged to lie down and watch it <*>
dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#237:1>
Subhro took off his coat, folded it carefully, placed it under
his head and lay down.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#238:1>
He decided to play along with her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#239:1>
But who knew if lying down like this was illegal or not!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#240:1>
What if the police caught them? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#241:1>
Monolina turned towards Subhro.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#242:1>
Placing her arm on his chest, she said, You don't realise it but you
are looking very different.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#243:1>
Maybe if you saw your face, you wouldn't recognise it! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#244:1>
Subhro said, I am indeed a different person now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#245:1>
Have you seen a flower bloom? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#246:1>
What does that mean?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#247:1>
What flower? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#248:1>
Any flower.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#249:1>
A bud appears on a plant.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#250:1>
Then, very slowly, little by little, it begins to open till it is a
full blown flower.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#251:1>
Then it falls off <*> dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#252:1>
No, I haven't seen this.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#253:1>
<w> I've </w> seen many kinds of flowers, garlands made of flowers,
flowers decorated in a flower vase. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#254:1>
The budding of a flower looks lovelier than a fully bloomed
flower. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#255:1>
But how can city people like us see such things? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#256:1>
A lot of houses have flowering plants in pots on their terraces.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#257:1>
Hashi had kept a few such potted plants on our terrace but
wasn't able to take care of them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#258:1>
You didn't take care? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#259:1>
Me?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#260:1>
Where do I have the time? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#261:1>
A beggar child came and stood beside them, asking for alms.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#262:1>
Lying under the tree in the gentle breeze, Subhro was just beginning
to savour life afresh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#263:1>
He didn't like beggars harassing him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#264:1>
The best way to get rid of them was to give them a coin or two.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#265:1>
But if one beggar got it, more would come.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#266:1>
And, in any case, <}> <-> Subro </-> <+> Subhro </+> </}> wasn't
carrying any change on him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#267:1>
Go away! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#268:1>
But the kid wouldn't budge.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#269:1>
His idea was to create annoyance.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#270:1>
Subhro scolded him again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#271:1>
Opening her small purse, Monolina took out a 10 paise coin and
put it into <w> Subhro's </w> palm, take this! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#272:1>
Monolina could have given the coin to the kid on her own.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#273:1>
Instead, why did she hand it to Subhro?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#274:1>
Subhro felt silly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#275:1>
Even if he didn't have change, he could have easily given the beggar
a rupee.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#276:1>
To him, a rupee meant nothing! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#277:1>
Did Monolina give that 10 paise coin to Subhro as alms?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#278:1>
He threw it at the beggar and mumbled, more beggars will now come.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#279:1>
Monolina said, I have more coins on me. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#280:1>
In the fresh breeze, Subhro began to breathe deeply.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#281:1>
He didn't even feel like lighting his pipe.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#282:1>
He hadn't smoked even once till now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#283:1>
Monolina, I feel as if I have become your age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#284:1>
Do you think you are very big? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#285:1>
From the point of view of age, I cannot deny I am quite old.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#286:1>
Besides, I have entered an extremely busy world.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#287:1>
I have never dreamt of lying under the sky in the afternoon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#288:1>
Thank God, you called me away <*> dotted-line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#289:1>
I am grateful to you. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#290:1>
A lot of us come here quite often.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#291:1>
We lie down and watch the sky. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#292:1>
Will you let me join your group? </p> <O> logo </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#293:1>
Monolina smiled without answering.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#294:1>
Subhro felt like licking that innocent smile away from her lips.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#295:1>
He had never felt like this before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#296:1>
Today, he was feeling as excited as a child. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#297:1>
Monolina said, Do you know of any such place where there is no
tension, no unhappiness, no hatred, no greed? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#298:1>
Subhro asked, Is there such a place on earth?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#299:1>
I don't think so. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#300:1>
There is. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#301:1>
Is there?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#302:1>
Where?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#303:1>
Have you found such a place? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#304:1>
No, not as yet.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#305:1>
But there must be such a place somewhere <*> dotted-line</*> and,
until I find it, I can imagine such a place in my mind <*> dotted-line</*>
lying like this with my eyes shut.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#306:1>
Why don't you try.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#307:1>
Shut your eyes <*> dotted-line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#308:1>
Subhro actually shut his eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#309:1>
He was instantly reminded of all the work he had left behind at the
office, unattended.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#310:1>
He felt irritated with himself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#311:1>
He tried to forget everything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#312:1>
A little later, he felt as if he was dozing off.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#313:1>
In sleep there was, of course, a peaceful place - - devoid of greed,
of hatred. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#314:1>
Subhro sat up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#315:1>
Monolina still lay with her eyes shut.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#316:1>
What did this girl want from him? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#317:1>
Monolina, tell me honestly, why have you brought me here? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#318:1>
Just like that! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#319:1>
Really?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#320:1>
But what if I get carried away?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#321:1>
What if I want to come here with you again and again? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#322:1>
You won't. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#323:1>
But what if I do? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#324:1>
Call me and <w> I'll </w> come. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#325:1>
But why should you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#326:1>
Who am I of yours?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#327:1>
You must be having a lot of friends of your own age <*>
dotted-line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#328:1>
Good Lord!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#329:1>
<w> It's </w> 5!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#330:1>
<w> I'll </w> have to go back to the office now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#331:1>
Come, <w> let's </w> go. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#332:1>
I don't feel like going.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#333:1>
But <w> there's </w> no way out.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#334:1>
<w> I'll </w> have to go back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#335:1>
At least once.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#336:1>
I haven't left word <*> dotted-line</*> a lot of people will wait
till I return. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#337:1>
Come, then. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#338:1>
Which way are you going? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#339:1>
The other way <*> dotted-line</*> <w> I'll </w> catch a bus a
little ahead. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#340:1>
<w> I'll </w> take a cab.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#341:1>
Can I drop you off somewhere? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#342:1>
No. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#343:1>
Will you ever come again, just like that, and call me away? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#344:1>
How do I know! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#345:1>
Then why did you come today?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#346:1>
Why did you call me away today? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#347:1>
I just felt like it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#348:1>
Monolina, <w> you're </w> so beautiful.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#349:1>
You gifted me two such wonderful hours today.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#350:1>
If I want to see you again, or if I want to fall in love with you?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#351:1>
It is only natural for people to love one another. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#352:1>
Not that kind of love <*> dotted-line</*> I feel as if I have
known you for a long time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#353:1>
As if you and I are two people very close to each other. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#354:1>
If two people lie side by side and shut their eyes, they will
feel that way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#355:1>
Once you open your eyes and look around you for some time, the
trance will break. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#356:1>
Monolina stood up suddenly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#357:1>
Then, extending an arm towards Subhro, she said, get up, or <w>
you'll </w> be late. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#358:1>
She dusted the back of his shirt, as if he was a child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#359:1>
Then, laughing like the colours on a dusklit sky, she said, I love
to make those who work too hard, forget their work for a while. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#360:1>
Will we see each other again? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#361:1>
Yes, whenever you feel up to it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#362:1>
Subhro knew he couldn't be any more late.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#363:1>
He walked towards the road and hailed a cab.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#364:1>
But Monolina refused outright to get inside.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#365:1>
She wanted to walk. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#366:1>
The cab carrying Subhro away made a U-turn.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#367:1>
He turned around and watched for a long time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#368:1>
Monolina was walking slowly, her head lowered.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#369:1>
It looked as if she would melt into the horizon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#370:1>
Wanting to light his pipe, Subhro put his hand inside his coat
pocket and felt something else. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#371:1>
It was a fistful of grass. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#372:1>
Monolina had stuffed it into his pocket.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#373:1>
He was about to throw it away but changed his mind.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#374:1>
Returning to his office, he stashed it away in one of his table
drawers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#375:1>
The days began to pass like before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#376:1>
In the same monotonous way.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#377:1>
In about a <O> logo </O> <w> week's </w> time, Subhro had to go to
Delhi on company work.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#378:1>
He returned after two days.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#379:1>
Monolina hadn't come. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#380:1>
Subhro remembered her sometimes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#381:1>
And his heart would feel crushed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#382:1>
When he had asked Monolina if they would ever meet again, she
said they could only if he wished it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#383:1>
Didn't he?

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#384:1>
But wishes are not everything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#385:1>
Monolina hadn't asked him for anything.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#386:1>
Subhro had also thought deeply over the fact she didn't have any
other intention.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#387:1>
She didn't try to lure him into falling in love with her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#388:1>
He had money, prestige.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#389:1>
But Monolina hadn't showed any interest in such things.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#390:1>
Not a paise had he spent on her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#391:1>
On the contrary, it was she who put a 10 paise coin into <w>
Subhro's </w> palm.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#392:1>
As if she was the heiress to a fortune, she had declared that she
had a lot more coins. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#393:1>
Monolina didn't ask for anything except only his willingness.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#394:1>
But that wasn't all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#395:1>
Because even if he wished, he couldn't make the time to lie on the
grass, beside the Ganga in the afternoon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#396:1>
So he didn't even try to track down Monolina.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#397:1>
He felt ashamed to ask his sister-in-law, Joyita, about her
whereabouts.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#398:1>
He knew where she lived.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#399:1>
He had dropped her home that night.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#400:1>
But how could he just drop in at her place and ask her to go out
with him!

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#401:1>
That wasn't possible.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#402:1>
He was Subhrojyoti Sengupta, a very busy person.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#403:1>
All this childishness didn't become him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#404:1>
Once in a while, he still pulls open the drawer and looks at the
fistful of grass.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#405:1>
It has dried up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#406:1>
But he still keeps it there.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#407:1>
Subhro sighs.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#408:1>
Lying down on the grass, under that tree in the afternoon with <w>
Monolina's </w> arm on his chest seems like a dream. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#409:1>
But it wasn't a dream.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#410:1>
The fistful of grass is still there to prove it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#411:1>
Monolina had asked, where was I when you were born? Subhro had
replied, you were a wish in the centre of my mind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-006#412:1>
Now Monolina remains only a wish.

<ICE-IND:W2F-006#413:1>
At the centre of his heart. </p> </I>
