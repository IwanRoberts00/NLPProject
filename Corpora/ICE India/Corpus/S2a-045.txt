<ICE-IND:S2A-045#1:1:A>
Friends <,,> today <w> I'm </w> going to talk to you about two
dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation <,,> by
electrolysts deposit process <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#2:1:A>
The passing century <,,> has witnessed <,> scientific investigation
<,,> of order systems <,,> such as <,> crystalline systems <,,> and so on and
so forth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#3:1:A>
Order was even <,,> discovered in liquids like liquid systems <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#4:1:A>
But during the last part of this century <,,> scientists have
realised <,,> that many recorded systems <,,> behave in perfectly orderly <,>
manner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#5:1:A>
For example <,,> biological systems are never crystalline <,,> and
they contain more than seventy percent water <,,> and yet <,> they perform
functions <,,> which are most orderly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#6:1:A>
Many physical <,,> technological <,,> and biological systems <,,>
have been shown to be related to <,> and described by <,,> non-integer
dimension <,,> as called <}> <-> fractional <.> dim </.> </-> <=> fractional
dimensions </=> </}> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#7:1:A>
A concept which was originally <,,> uh discovered <,> and
beautifully demonstrated by <,,> B B Mendel Broad <,,> in his classic book
called <mention> <?> Fractal </?> </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#8:1:A>
Uh lot of information has been gathered about <,,> these systems
<,,> such as <,,> technique such as experimental theoritical and computer
assimilation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#9:1:A>
In this lecture today <,,> <w> I'm </w> going to introduce you <,,>
to a <,,> process of <,,> generating <?> fractal </?> aggregate <,,> that is
developed in our <,> laboratory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#10:1:A>
The plan of my lecture <,> will be as follows <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#11:1:A>
Although most of you must be <,,> familiar with the <}> <-> <.> fla
fact </.> </-> <=> factual </=> </}> concepts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#12:1:A>
For the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field <,> and
for the sake of completness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#13:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> first give <,> an introduction to the concepts of <?>
fractal </?> <,,> such as definition of <?> fractal </?> <,,> the concept of
self similarity and <,> their invariance <,,> the physical significance of
<?> fractal </?> dimension <,,> and so forth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#14:1:A>
Before going over to the <,> method <,> of generating <?> fractal
</?> that we have developed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#15:1:A>
And since <,,> the aggregates that we obtain are <,> diffusion
limited aggregate <,,> <w> I'll </w> introduce the diffusion limited
aggregation of <,,> with an nth standard the module which is developed by
with an nth standard <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#16:1:A>
The first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates
<,> was given by electro deposition process <,,> by Sauda Atoll and Gregor
Atoll <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#17:1:A>
Whereas the method which we have developed is <,> electroless
deposition <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#18:1:A>
And using this technique <,,> we have generated aggregates of
metals <,> like <,> copper <,> silver and zinc <,,> which will be compared
and contrasted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#19:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> also show <,> a method of how to measure the <?>
fractal </?> dimension <,> experimentally <,> for the <.> agre </.> type of
aggregates that we have generated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#20:1:A>
The diffusion limited aggregation is <,,> aggregates are formed
<,,> by <,> uh interspin which are very near to equilibrium <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#21:1:A>
I mean very far from equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#22:1:A>
Whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium <,,> the
morphology of aggregates is entirely different <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#23:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> give some beautiful examples of <,,> diffusionless
aggregates <,> which are generated in our laboratory <,> from crystals <,,>
which are very near to the equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#24:1:A>
<?> Fractal </?> geometry provides <,,> a natural framework for
describing and understanding those form <,,> this according to Euclidian
geometry are formulae <,,> that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#25:1:A>
Now how to describe fractions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#26:1:A>
<.> Frac </.> in general if you observe a particular object for
example take a <,,> glass of water <,,> and a bucket of water <,,> where the
mass per unit volume <,,> which tells you about the density of water <,> does
not depend upon <,,> the volume of water gratitute <,> for measurements <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#27:1:A>
Whether you take a glass <,> or you take a bucket <,> the density
of the water <,> will remain one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#28:1:A>
So in Euclidian type of object <,,> the density remains constant
<,> irrespective of <,> type of the measuring unit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#29:1:A>
But <,,> if you consider some different object <,,> as <w> I'll
</w> show here <,,> then the density no longer ramains constant <,,> as the
size of the object <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#30:1:A>
This <,> object is generated in this particular case <,,> by well
defined determinous to prove <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#31:1:A>
A cross is generated by putting <,,> four particle <,> around the
central particle <,,> and this is used as a <,,> iterative unit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#32:1:A>
At the four corners <,,> and at the centre <,> you replace every
particle by the cross <,,> and <,> you will generate this figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#33:1:A>
And if this process <,,> is repeated <,,> several times <,,> then
<,,> a figure <,> such as this <,> is obtained <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#34:1:A>
Now let us try to calculate the density of this object <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#35:1:A>
Or <,,> as <w> you've </w> seen here <,> since density can be
written as <,,> density can be written as mass upon volume <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#36:1:A>
So we can write this equation as <,> mass is proportional to volume
<,,> that is <,> mass is proportional to length <,,> cube <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#37:1:A>
And in two dimensions <,> mass will be proportional to <,> length
square <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#38:1:A>
Now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit
because <,,> number of particles will be proportional to the mass of the <,,>
uh <O> one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#39:1:A>
So number of particles <,> in Euclidian system <,> is proportional
to the <,,> linear dimension to the power of Euclidian dimension <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#40:1:A>
For the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional
system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#41:1:A>
And as you can see here <,,> in this particular system <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#42:1:B>
Here value is at K <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#43:1:A>
K is any number <,> if this is <,,> K is equal to one

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#44:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#45:1:A>
I have <,> okay <w> I'll </w> just put it up here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#46:1:A>
So you have K is equal to zero K is equal to one <,,> K is equal to
two <,,> and <,,> K is equal to some number K let us say <,,> <O> cough </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#47:1:A>
And <w> I'll </w> show you how it is obtained <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#48:1:A>
So you will have <,> here for K is equal to one <,,> you have five
particles <,> in this particular figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#49:1:A>
So your N is <,,> five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#50:1:A>
For K is equal to two <,,> you have twenty-five particles <,> as
you can see there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#51:1:A>
So your N is <,,> five twelve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#52:1:A>
And so <,> your K is equal to <,,> K <,,> and N is five to power of
K <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#53:1:A>
Similarly <,> if you take the linear dimension that is if you
measure this <,> distance <,,> then for K is equal to one <,> simply K into
three <,> that is three times K <,> this and I have not drawn it properly <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#54:1:A>
If you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus
this <,,> will give you this <,,> for <,> K is equal to one <,> two <,> and
three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#55:1:A>
So for K is equal to <,,> two <,> we have K into T to the power of
two <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#56:1:A>
You can count here <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#57:1:A>
It will give about nine distance <,> three <,> plus three <,> plus
three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#58:1:A>
And for K is equal to K <,> <O> cough </O> we have K into three to
the power of K <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#59:1:A>
So <,,> in this equation if you have <,,> log of N <,,> divided by
log of <,,> N <,> to the limit A going to infinity <,,> then you find that
this comes out to be <,,> log of five <,> divided by log of N <,> using one
point <,,> four six five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#60:1:A>
So you see that <,> the power of the <,> I mean if you <O> cough
</O> can rewrite this equation it will become <,,> N into number of <O> one
word </O> <,> S to the power of <,> some constant number <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#61:1:B>
But A is unit here <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#62:1:A>
Right <,> A is uh <,> you can take it uniquely or you can know
even if you write A <,> and solve the equation we get this in the limit A
tending to infinity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#63:1:A>
So we find that <,> this number <,,> comes out to be a <,,>
fractional number <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#64:1:A>
So <,,> for Euclidian object <,,> you have a proportional to L to
the power of Euclidian dimension <,,> and for a fractal object <,,> this is a
fractional number <,,> and because it is a fractional number <,> it is called
<,,> a fractal system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#65:1:A>
This word fractal was coined by <,> B B Mendel Broad to represent
those system <,,> which occurs the physical properties cannot be described
<,> by using Euclidian dimension <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#66:1:A>
For example if you take a mountain <,,> you cannot call it a
triangle <,,> you cannot call it a <,> sphere <,> and therefore its
properties <,> will not be describable by Euclidian geometry <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#67:1:A>
You need to take some other measure <,> to describe the properties
of such systems <,> which are plenty in nature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#68:1:A>
Uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if
you look at them <,> you cannot put them into orderly phenomenon <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#69:1:A>
And then you require some science to describe such systems because
the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#70:1:A>
If you cannot predict <,,> than naturally you can't <,,> have some
<,> uh good sign you can't predict certain things then <w> it's </w> not
science <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#71:1:A>
So in order to bring predictability you need a framework <,> which
will describe the image <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#72:1:A>
So fractal framework <,> produce <-> a provides </-> <,,> something
<-> which </-> with which you can describe these events with <,> certainity
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#73:1:A>
Now <,,> we should understand that there is this <,> dimension <,>
which is used <,,> and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension
of the system <,> but that is not the real dimension of the system

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#74:1:A>
Really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#75:1:A>
This term <.> fra </.> dimension is borrowed because <,> that
particular number replaces the dimension <,,> in the <.> Eucli </.> normal
<,> uh equation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#76:1:A>
So we call a fractal dimension <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#77:1:A>
It is not <,> a dimension <,,> in the actual sense of the word <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#78:1:A>
It is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of
the system <,,> to make the <.> mea </.> physical measurements meaningful
<,,> we call it a dimension <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#79:1:A>
So when the notion of Euclid and dimension poses a conceptual
problem <,,> in <}> <-> <.> underst </.> </-> <=> understanding </=> </}>
certain system <,,> the concept of fractal dimensionality <,,> gives a
manageable and convenient answer <,,> to such questions <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#80:1:A>
Just for the sake of <,,> completeness <,> <w> I'll </w> give some
mathematical equation which should not put you off <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#81:1:A>
So in general <,> if <?> rover </?> is the density of the aggregate
at a point R <,,> and N is the total number of particles in a cluster of
radius I <,,> then the <}> <-> density </-> <=> density </=> </}> correlation
function can be written as <,,> here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#82:1:A>
So you have several forms <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> this
equation <,> which I have written there is simple form U is equal to M upon V
<,,> C R can be written as R to the power of minus three minus three that E
is the Euclidian dimension and <,> this D is the fractal dimension <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#83:1:A>
If this number is written as alpha <,> then you have C R <,>
varying as R to the power of <,,> minus alpha <,,> and fractal dimension can
be measured <,,> experimentally <,> by using any one of these <O> cough </O>
equations <,> when different techniques <,,> are required for <,> such
measurements <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#84:1:A>
Now I will describe the <,,> concepts of self similarity and <,,>
scale invariance <,,> of the fractal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#85:1:A>
Self similarity and scale invariance are <,,> the fundamental
properties of fractal

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#86:1:A>
I don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are
fractal <,,> in which the scale invariance is not necessary in the sense <,>
the power which we saw just now <,,> this <,,> D <,,> distance <,> need not
be a constant number <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#87:1:A>
It can be expressed as a power T <,,> and those fractal are called
multifractal <,> okay the common fractal normally I mean <,> to be
conceptually very <,> simple <,,> the scale invariance and <,,> scale
similarity <,> are considered to be <,> two important characteristics <,> of
the <,> fractal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#88:1:A>
So in this figure which we have generated just sometime before <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#89:1:A>
If you take any part of this figure <,,> and enlarge it <,,> then
you get <,> a figure which is identical to the <}> <-> <.> start </.> </->
<=> starting </=> </}> figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#90:1:A>
And then again take any part of it <,,> so I have put it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#91:1:A>
Then again enlarge a part of this figure <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#92:1:A>
It will appear identical to the original figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#93:1:A>
And that is why <,> the fractal systems are called <,> self-similar
<,> because <,,> the <,,> <.> a </.> any part of the system if it is elarged
or contracted <,> looks like the original system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#94:1:A>
But this self similarity ends <,,> when you start distinguishing
between the particles <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#95:1:A>
When you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the <-> like </-> <,>
original figure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#96:1:A>
And so this puts a blow to critical form <,,> below which the
system will not behave as a fractal system

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#97:1:B>
Figures might be same

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-045#98:1:A>
No <,> it is it is no longer a fractal system then <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#99:1:A>
And similarly <,,> the size of the aggregate itself <,> puts a
bound <,,> above which <,,> the system cannot be called as a fractal system
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#100:1:A>
Because I may have a large system <,> with sub units like this
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#101:1:A>
Now each sub unit is a fractal <,,> but these sub units might be
arranged in crystalline position <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#102:1:A>
So in that case <,,> I have fractal behaviour only between <,,>
the size of the particle <,,> and the size of the aggregate which is fractal
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#103:1:A>
In between these two units <,> the aggregate behave like fractal
<,> but above and below these limit <,> they do not behave like fractal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#104:1:A>
And these are called the lower and upper critical bounds <,,> of
the fractal system <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#105:1:A>
Now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a
<,> precise deterministic mathematical rule <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#106:1:A>
But in general <,> we make a <,> fractal which exist <,,> are not
created by mathematical rules <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#107:1:A>
So in that case <,,> the <,,> self similarity is not exact <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#108:1:A>
It is a statistical self similarity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#109:1:A>
As we can see here <,,> the object which are created for example
by some processes <,> like the smoke <,,> are self similar <,> and here again
<,> if you enlarge a <,,> small part anywhere here <,> it will look similar
to the starting object <,> it will not be exactly identical to the starting
object <,> and yet it will be similar to the starting object <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#110:1:A>
<w> It's </w> statistical properties will be <,,> similar to what
you have from the original object <,,> until and unless you start resolving
between the particles <,,> when again the self similarity breaks down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#111:1:A>
So you have statistical <,,> or deterministic factors <,,> which
are self similar <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#112:1:A>
So let us see what is scale invariance of statistic <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#113:1:A>
The equation M is proportional to L to the power of D <,,> sixth
off the scale invariance because <,,> the <,> in this equation it all remains
constant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#114:1:A>
But the question <,> we comes at to in this equation <,> Euclidian
<,,> where Euclidian is dimension is used also this power remain constant <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#115:1:A>
So what is so great about the invariance of fraction <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#116:1:A>
In order system also you have scale invariance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#117:1:A>
This <,> the importance of scale invariance becomes <,> clear <,,>
when we look at it from the <,> other side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#118:1:A>
What I mean by other side is <,,> that is if you have objects for
which <,,> for the measurement of which <,,> mathematical equation cannot be
written down

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#119:1:A>
You cannot define it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#120:1:A>
Then <,,> you cannot define if that means they are not still
invariant <,,> whereas for those objects for which <,> you can give some
meaning to the <O> one word </O> <,> are only objects which are scale
invariant <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#121:1:A>
I will give a very specific example <,,> of a coastland <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#122:1:A>
We have all visited beaches <,,> that is sea beach I mean <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#123:1:A>
And if <w> you'll </w> see the morphology of the sea beach <,,>
you will find it something like <,,> this <,> <w> it's </w> not going to be a
straight line <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#124:1:A>
Now <w> I'll </w> take a one kilometre strip of <,> the coastline
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#125:1:A>
This is one kilometre <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#126:1:A>
And <,,> I measure this one kilometre length <,> by using a metre
long scale <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#127:1:A>
I keep my metre long scale here <,> and start measuring this by
kilometre <,,> length <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#128:1:A>
I find that <,,> my coastline <,> length of my coastline is
thirty-two kilometres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#129:1:A>
Then I take a one metre <,,> uh sorry one centimetre uh <,> strip
<,,> and again measure this coast length <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#130:1:A>
Again here there will be something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#131:1:A>
So I measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the
power of seven kilometres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#132:1:A>
And if I take one millimetre it becomes <,> ten to the power of
nine kilometres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#133:1:A>
There it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of
the coastline because depending on what <,> unit I take for measurement it
keeps on varying <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#134:1:A>
But that is not true <,> because the including coastline can be
<,,> statistically defined

<ICE-IND:S2A-045#135:1:A>
It cannot be exactly defined <,> but length of the coastline can
be statistically defined <,> by an equation <,,> saying <O> a few words </O>
if we put <,> one metre one centimetre or one millimetre <,> you will get
<,,> L <,,> exactly predictable <,,> </I>
