<h> Exports of Agricultural Produce - - Problems & Prospects </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#2:1>
<h> <ul> Introduction </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#3:1>
The organisation of Indian agriculture has been based on
individual farming under the system of peasant proprietorship.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#4:1>
No attempt has been made in India to deliberately shift the terms of
trade against agriculture.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#5:1>
Further, owing to the persistence of imbalances between the supply and
demand for agricultural commodities, particularly food grains, the terms of
trade have continued to be favourable to agriculture throughout the greater
part of the plan period including the first decade of the green revolution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#6:1>
Also, because of growing influence of farmers the farm subsidies have
been increasing continuously resutling in the enfeeblement of the <w>
Government's </w> capacity to make productive investments in agriculture.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#7:1>
The rise in subsidies on irrigation and fertilisers has induced the
allocation of resources in favour of crops like <mention> wheat </mention>
and <mention> rice </mention> resulting in the achievement of
self-sufficiency in foodgrains. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#8:1>
Indian agriculture has played and continues to play a very
important role in the development of the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#9:1>
It has been contributing substantially to crucial foreign exchange
earnings for the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#10:1>
Major agricultural and allied products exported are <mention> tea,
coffee, rice, raw cotton, tobacco, cashew kernels, spices, oil meal, fruits
</mention> and <mention> vegetables, processed fruits, juices </mention> and
miscellaneous processed items, marine products, sugar and molasses and meat
and meat preparations.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#11:1>
The value of exports of these products has increased substantially in
the last 25 years.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#12:1>
The exports in 1970-71 aggregated Rs. 487 <indig> crores </indig> ,
accounting for 31.7 per cent of the total exports by value ( Table 1).

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#13:1>
Exports of agriculltural and allied products continued to rise in
<indig> rupee </indig> terms <O> <ul> TABLE 1 </ul> </O> <O> caption </O> to
reach a figure of <indig> Rs. </indig> 8,791 <indig> crores </indig> in
1992-93.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#14:1>
In fact the share of the agricultural produce in total exports has
continued to decline, and stood at around 17 per cent in 1992-93. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#15:1>
Itemwise, the major items to earn fairly substantial foreign
exchange through exports have been cotton yarn and manufactures, earning
<indig> Rs. </indig> 75 <indig> crores </indig> in 1970-71 and <indig> Rs.
</indig> 3,929 <indig> crores </indig> in 1992-93 ( Table 2). </p> <O> <ul>
TABLE 2 </ul> </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#16:1>
Tea has also been a major foreign exchange earner,
contributing <indig> Rs. </indig> 148 <indig> crores </indig> in 1970-71
to <indig> Rs. </indig> 1212 <indig> crores </indig> in 199-92, with a slight
fall in 1992-93 to <indig> Rs. </indig> 973 <indig> crores </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#17:1>
<w> Coffee's </w> earnings through foreign trade have witnessed
steady increase from <indig> Rs. </indig> 25 <indig> crores </indig> in
1970-71 to <indig> Rs. </indig> 366 <indig> crores </indig> in 1992-93. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#18:1>
The performance of Cashew Kernel exports also has been
remarkable.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#19:1>
The total value of exports increased from <indig> Rs. </indig> 33
<indig> crores </indig> in 1970-71 to <indig> Rs. </indig> 749 <indig> crores
</indig> in 1992-93.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#20:1>
Fruits and vegetables earned a total of <indig> Rs. </indig> 361
<indig> crores </indig> in 1992-93, and spices in the same year accounted for
<indig> Rs. </indig> 369 <indig> crores </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#21:1>
It has been noticed that the exports of primary products lately
have declined in US dollar terms by 8.6 percent resulting in a fall in the
share of agricultural produce in total exports.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#22:1>
The major decline under primary products were recorded in tea ( 31.7
percent ) .

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#23:1>
The target, as per the Eighth Five Year Plan and Union Ministry of
Commerce for the agricultural sector for the year 1993-94 is a growth of 18.4
% over its earlier performance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#24:1>
Exports of agricultural produce ( including Cotton & Jute
manufactures ) as a proportion of GDP at factor cost have lowered around
two percent or less for the years 1980-81 to 1992-93. <O> <ul> TABLE 3 </ul>
</O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#25:1>
In fact, agricultural exports as a proportion of total value of
agricultural production in the country do not go beyond 7 percent, and have
remained either six percent or below for most of the years in the last decade
( Table 3 and 4 ) .

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#26:1>
Thus there appears to be a fairly small and constant proportion of
the <w> country's </w> agricultural exports. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#27:1>
It may however be remembered that world agricultural trade occurs
in a highly imperfect setting where world prices are determined by relatively
small surplus and deficits which enter world trade and do not necessarily
influence world consumption and production particularly where tariff barriers
continue to be imposed by the developed and the developing worlds.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#28:1>
Thus world prices can change substantially even with small changes
in production. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#29:1>
Although India is a fairly large producer and consumer of
agricultural commodities by world standards, <w> India's </w> share is
marginal as far as international trade in these commodities is concerned.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#30:1>
According to estimates of UNCTAD, India produce about 10 percent of
the world agricultural output, but her share in world trade in agricultural
commodities has been around 0.6 percent.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#31:1>
It will therefore be seen that the share of <w> India's </w> exports
in World trade would be still much smaller.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#32:1>
Further <w> India's </w> involvement in world agricultural trade has
been declining during the past 25 years whether this is measured in
comparison with world agricultural trade, <w> India's </w> international
trade or her GDP.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#33:1>
Thus Indian imports & exports of agricultural commodities have
declined as a share of a) world trade, b) <w> India's </w> own total trade
and c) her national income.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#34:1>
These shares have declined more than the share of agricultural sector
or of foreign trade in <w> India's </w> GDP. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#35:1>
The not so rosy picture of <w> India's </w> foreign trade in
agricultural products is a fairly true reflection of the <quote> ` food
security and self sufficiency' </quote> policy adopted by the country since
mid-sixties.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#36:1>
The gradual fall in exports of agricultural products can be
explained by the fact that the <quote> ` Green revolution' </quote> while
reducing the supply deficit of food grains did not lead to a generation of
exportable surpluses.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#37:1>
The emphasis had been on the greater production of cereals and as a
consequence the possibility of exporting greater quantities and of
diversifying exports of agricultural products took a back policy seat. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#38:1>
<h> <ul> Problems & Potential </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#39:1>
The Indian Government has introduced policy changes recently
which are normally summarised in the terms used - - liberalisation and
globalisation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#40:1>
Fairly substantial hopes have been raised with regard to the
improvenment in the working of the economy and therefore in increasing the
<quote> ` all-round' </quote> efficiency.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#41:1>
The managers of the agricultural sector in India tend to envisage an
improved and an increased role for this sector both in the domestic economy
and the trade sector.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#42:1>
It would be pertinent to evaluate the prospects of Indian
agricultural trade - - particularly the exports.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#43:1>
A study of relative prices in the international market and Indian
agricultural market over a period of time has shown that both domestic and
international prices grew more or less at the same rate until mid-1980s but
since then the export prices have increased quite substantially.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#44:1>
Thus changes or movements in domestic prices particularly since
1980s, have tended to favour importables as against exportables among
agricultural commodities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#45:1>
It must also be emphasised that the <quote> ` planning' </quote>
for a greater role for Indian agriculture in <w> India's </w> foreign trade
must be seen in the backdrop of less stable agricultural world market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#46:1>
In fact, the projections show that prices of Indian agricultural
products - - traditional export items among them - - have been and would be
much higher than the world prices of these products.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#47:1>
Some of these products are <mention> rice, groundnut, cotton, jute,
tea, coffee, tobacco, pepper, bananas </mention> etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#48:1>
Further, world price indices for agricultural commodities available
from the World Bank and UNCTAD show a sharp adverse movement against such
commodities in their terms of trade with manufactured goods.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#49:1>
According to these sources, between 1980 and 1990, in dollar terms,
agricultural commodity prices fell by around 30 percent while prices of
manufactured goods rose by 35 percent. </p> <fnr> **1 </fnr>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#50:1>
India accounts for a fairly large share of world agricultural
output.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#51:1>
Historically, in the present times, a relatively small proportion of
world output in the agricultural sector enters world trade for most
agricultural commodities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#52:1>
Thus, if India had to enter such a market with its <quote> `
exportables' </quote> , the result would be a <}> <-> worseuing </-> <+>
worsening </+> </}> of the terms of trade of agricultural commodities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#53:1>
For <quote> ` importable' </quote> commodities, liberalisation would
increase domestic <}> <-> coupetition, </-> <+> competition </+> </}> thereby
making domestic production uneconomical and finally <}> <-> enging </-> <+>
ending </+> </}> up with reduced domestic production and higher prices.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#54:1>
The traditional items have low demand and supply elasticities and as
a consequence there would be very little available for the export market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#55:1>
India has real export potential in the development of horticulture
and food processing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#56:1>
In fact floricultural, horticultural, trade potential in the world is
estimated to be growing at the rate <+> of </+> 30 % per year.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#57:1>
India, with its <quote> ` varied agro-climatic' </quote> conditions
and a huge variety of horticultural products can benefit substantially from
this ever growing world demand.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#58:1>
India can produce value-added products which would also help the
growth of the <}> <-> agrobased </-> <+> agro-based </+> </}> industries in
the country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#59:1>
But any success in this area must perforce demand strict production,
packaging, wrapping techniques; and will call for immense efforts in the
field of international marketing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#60:1>
There is a huge potential to be tapped, but there are stiff <quote> `
conditions' </quote> to be met thus stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary
measures would have to be ensured.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#61:1>
India can, with some effort, export several horticultural products
like banana, <indig> litchi, chikoo, ber, </indig> pomegranates, custard
apples, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#62:1>
India enjoys an advantage in terms of quality of many of these
fruits.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#63:1>
The vegetables in which India can manage to have an edge over other
countries in the export market include onion, chilli, and some seasonal
vegetables. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#64:1>
There is a further substantial potential in the cultivation and
exports of products, which are mainly medicinal in nature on the <indig> Neem
</indig> tree.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#65:1>
Research has indicated that this tree has a vast potential to meet
the increasing requirements of the field of medicine.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#66:1>
India is uniquely placed to produce large quantitites of this tree
and export its detracted products.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#67:1>
The tree can grow anywhere and as a consequence a dual purpose of
increasing exports and of meeting environmental ( Social forestry )
requirements will be met. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-007#68:1>
The progress in meeting export requirements of agricultural
products would depend upon how efficiently the country produces these
products and how it manages to overcome the <quote> " Whims" </quote> of the
world market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#69:1>
The country should go in for production for the international market,
and not depend upon the surplus from the domestic market.

<ICE-IND:W1A-007#70:1>
This calls for specialised studies in international markets and
marketing and continuous research and development efforts on the part of
Indian Agriculture. <*> dotted line from left to right </*> <footnote> **1

This has serious consequences for the economy in the
post-liberalisation period </footnote> </I>
