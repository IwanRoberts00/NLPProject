<ICE-IND:W2B-038#3:1>
<bold> In </bold> the 1970s, newspapers went ape over a series of
extraordinary anthropological finds in East Africa.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#4:1>
This was at a time when there was more or less a consensus that the
group of non-ape primates - - hominids, to give them their name - - that
had eventually evolved into humans had appeared about 15 million years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#5:1>
The media flashed each step in the dramatic discoveries that led to a
better understanding of early human evolution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#6:1>
If the media was excited, scientists too were no less thrilled over
the Kenyan fossils of <it> Homo habilis </it> and <it> <foreign> Homo erectus
</foreign> </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#7:1>
Tanzania literally had the world on its knees studying the 3.7 million
year old footprints left behind by some unknown human ancestor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#8:1>
The fossilized bones of Ethiopian <quote> ` Lucy' </quote> and her
fellow australopithecenes stirred scientific speculation to fever pitch.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#9:1>
Many scientists devoted their entire careers to drawing up updated,
better resolved and more detailed evolutionary family trees of mankind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#10:1>
It was this complacent scenario that was rudely shaken by its
hitherto firm foundations by an academic atom bomb exploded, in 1987,
by Allan Wilson and Vincent Sarich, of the University of California,
Berkeley, U.S.A.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#11:1>
If found to be correct, their theory promised to re-write the
entire history of man. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#12:1>
The claims of the Berkeley biochemists can be summed up in
just one sentence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#13:1>
Each person on earth today, they announced, could trace his or her
ancestry back to a single woman who lived in Africa 200,000 years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#14:1>
The press, ever quick on the uptake, baptised her <quote> `
Eve'</quote> - - the mother of mankind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#15:1>
<quote> ` Eve' </quote> soon became the bone of contention
between palaeontologists and biochemists with battle lines being drawn up and
no quarters given.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#16:1>
The story of Eve is also the story of the clash of the Titans,
between those who dug up evidence of the past in the form of fossilized
remains and those who looked into test tubes for clues to the past.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#17:1>
But what exactly had Sarich and Wilson done that had sparked off such
controversy ?

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#18:1>
Sarich and Wilson were not new to announcing provocative theories on
human evolution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#19:1>
Their initial salvo in the field was fired in the 1960s itself with
results similar to the reactions they were getting now. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#20:1>
The sixties was a time for <quote> ` hands-on' </quote>
anthropology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#21:1>
Fossil remains were carefully excavated, carted with infinite care
to the laboratories and studied in detail over years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#22:1>
Vincent Sarich and Allan Wilson decided to look for clues to the
past, not in the African savanna but inside the body itself, among its
proteins to be precise.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#23:1>
The question to which they addressed themselves was one which
contemporary anthropologists were also aiming at.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#24:1>
<quote> ` When did the human line first branch off from the apes'
</quote> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#25:1>
Wilson and Sarich decided to look at the proteins of the body and
to compare them to - - evolutionarily speaking - - our closest relatives.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#26:1>
They knew that even the same protein in related species is
slightly different because of mutations that occur after the species split
off from a common ancestor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#27:1>
This reasoning was fairly conservative and in keeping with facts and
beliefs of the day.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#28:1>
But the twist in the tale came when the two biochemists claimed that
mutations occurred, through time, at a steady rate, much like a molecular
clock ticking away at predictable intervals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#29:1>
They claimed that it was this molecular ticking of the proteins that
could serve to date the separation of species from a common ancestor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#30:1>
Species that had the most diverse proteins must have separated early
and the differences accumulated over the long time following separation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#31:1>
Those with kindred proteins obviously had split away more
recently. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#32:1>
According to the biochemical evidence gleaned from a study of
protein similarity they announced that humans were most distantly related
to the lemurs ( among primates ) and most closely to gorillas and
chimpanzees.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#33:1>
In fact, the protein clock indicated that the proteins of
chimpanzees, gorillas and humans had diverted a scant 5 million years ago,
much to the chagrin of established anthropologists of the day who had
favoured the 15 million year date as being the time of divergence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#34:1>
Ironically the 1970s discoveries that had so excited the
anthropologists now ruled in favour of Wilson and Sarich.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#35:1>
Paleonathropolgists had to bow before evidence they themselves had
dug up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#36:1>
They were hoist with their own petard and grudgingly accepted that
the road to humankind began about 5 to 7 million years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#37:1>
Some of the 15 million year old bones that they had dug up belonged
to direct ancestors of the orangutan and not man as they had hoped.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#38:1>
Wilson and his colleagues did not rest on their laurels.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#39:1>
By the late 1970s they wre readying themselves for the big showdon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#40:1>
It was to be a battle between the bones and the genes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#41:1>
The consensus at that time was that all modern human populations
could trace their genesis back to one million years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#42:1>
This was when <it> Homo erectus </it> first came out of <O> <&> page
</&> 26 </O> Africa to As1a, Europe and Indonesia.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#43:1>
Conventional interpretation of subsequent fossil finds held that
<it> Homo erectus </it> evolved into modern <it> H. sapiens </it> in each of
these places.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#44:1>
Regional differences that characterise the variety of our species
came later. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#45:1>
Wilson and his colleagues decided to use another molecular
clock to test the accuracy of the one million year divergence date.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#46:1>
This time they chose the mitochondria to act as a molecular clock.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#47:1>
Mitochondria are the extranuclear, cellular organelles that work
as the powerhouse of a cell.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#48:1>
They also contain a little deoxyribonucleic acid which is called mDNA
to differentiate it from the nDNA or nuclear DNA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#49:1>
Mitochondrial genes differ from chromosomal genes in fundamental
ways.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#50:1>
An offspring gets equal amounts of nuclear DNA from both his parents.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#51:1>
The <w> father's </w> sperm is an actuality nothing more than the
vehicle for nDNA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#52:1>
However, the <w> mother's </w> ovum contains cellular organelles as
well as the nDNA.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#53:1>
The <w> mother's </w> mitochondria are thus passed on to the child.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#54:1>
This is an almost exclusively maternal line of inheritance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#55:1>
Mitochondrial genes also <O> sketch </O> have a higher rate of
mutation as compared to nuclear genes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#56:1>
Mitochondrial genes wre thus uniquely suited to act as molecular
clocks especially since <w> Wilson's </w> studies had indicated that human
mitochondrial DNA mutated at a steady rate of 2-4 per cent every million
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#57:1>
This would mean about 330-660 mutations per million years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#58:1>
Like his earlier work which had pinpointed the time of divergence
of the human stock, the mDNA clock focused on the diversity caused by
accumulated mutations over the years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#59:1>
Only this time different species were not being studied.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#60:1>
What was scrutinized was the difference between separate populations
of the human species.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#61:1>
Wilson and his colleagues wanted to use mDNA as a tool to analyse how
mDNA in Asians differed from its counterparts in Africans or Europeans.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#62:1>
In the mid-1980s <w> Wilson's </w> students Rebecca Cann and Mark
Stoneking took mitochondrial DNA from women living in Europe, Asia, Africa,
New Guinea and Australia for detailed comparative analyses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#63:1>
In 1987, they announced their findings.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#64:1>
Most of the mDNA from the five sources were strikingly similar.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#65:1>
This meant that the groups had diverged recently and differences had
not had time to build up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#66:1>
However, there was one extremely significant finding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#67:1>
The mDNA from the African lineages showed twice as much diversity
as the rest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#68:1>
This indicated that the African mDNA was the oldest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#69:1>
It had been around for at least twice as long as the others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#70:1>
Anthropologists agreed with the story till this point because,
after all, the oldest fossils were African.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#71:1>
But the harmony ended abruptly with the subsequent claims from <w>
Cann's </w> laboratory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#72:1>
The biochemists claimed that all living humans share as their
earliest common ancestor, an African woman who lived a mere 200,000 years
ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#73:1>
There was a discrepancy of about 800,000 years between their
calculations and that of the conventional <w> anthropologist's </w> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#74:1>
It was a difficult concept to accept and many traditional
anthropologists dismissed Eve as a <quote> ` biochemical bauble' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#75:1>
However, it must be made clear that there is no evidence yet of a
time on earth when only one single woman walked it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#76:1>
Many other women must have lived at the same time but their
mitochondrial lineages have just not survived.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#77:1>
Thus, in a way the label <quote> ` Eve' </quote> is a trifle
misleading. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#78:1>
The <quote> ` Eve'</quote>-hypothesis holds that all current
humans harbour no non-African genes predating Eve.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#79:1>
This meant that <w> Eve's </w> people wiped out local populations and
the results of inbreeding ( if any ) did not survive long enough to leave
their stamp on human history.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#80:1>
This drastic revision of conventionally held views was,
predictably enough, not taken sitting down by older, established
anthropologists.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#81:1>
They questioned the accuracy of <O> <&> page </&> 27 </O> the
molecular clock by which evolution was timed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#82:1>
For the clock to be precise and reliable a couple of assumptions must
hold true.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#83:1>
The genetic similarity of the species being studied must be a
function of their relatedness and also directly proportional to the recency
of their divergence from a common ancestor.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#84:1>
This, in turn, requires that the genetic matter mutate at a constant
rate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#85:1>
Then again, the mutations should not affect the survival of the
individual.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#86:1>
That is to say, the individual should neither be culled nor favoured
by natural selection.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#87:1>
Culling would tend to eliminate mutations and preserve the original
gene such that the common ancestor seems more recent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#88:1>
Favoured selection for a particular mutation would, conversely, make
the divergence seem more distant in time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#89:1>
However, the biochemists are quick to point out that the mDNA
that they chose to study are <quote> " neutral" </quote> for slection.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#90:1>
This is basically because much of the DNA here is junk DNA or DNA
that does not contain sequences that code for proteins.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#91:1>
These also do not seem to affect the <O> <box> sketch </box> </O> <O>
caption </O> phenotype at all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#92:1>
Thus there seems to be no reason why natural selection should
favour or cull the individuals. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#93:1>
Other dissenters pointed out that at least one other factor would
interfere with the molecular clock.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#94:1>
This factor is what they call <quote> " random loss" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#95:1>
This refers to the genetic loss in each generation when some women
die childless.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#96:1>
Whenever this happens a mitochondrial type is irrevocably lost to
history.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#97:1>
Thus while mutations increase the amount of variation within a
population, random loss constantly eats away at it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#98:1>
The refutation of this charge is that while random loss of lineages
might influence the number of mitochondrial types around at any point in
time, but the ones that survive will have the same degree of varition among
them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#99:1>
And since this is what the clock runs on, it runs well despite random
loss. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#100:1>
With the debate becoming acrimonious, both sides dug deep into
their arsenal of academic weapons to consolidate their position.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#101:1>
With the quantum leap in biotechnological methods now available
<w> Wilson's </w> school now holds an ace up its sleeve. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#102:1>
Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) that allows researchers to
isolate the gene of choice and to amplify it has been a boon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#103:1>
Instead of comparing patterns of DNA fragments cut by restriction
enzymes as Cann did in her original study, PCR helps produce sample that can
be compared base pair by base pair along any chosen length of DNA. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-038#104:1>
Linda Vigilant, another of <w> Wilson's </w> students made
elegant use of PCR technique.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#105:1>
She compared mitochondrial DNA obtained from a single hair taken
from almost a hundred volunteers coming from different genetic stocks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#106:1>
She focussed on a section of the mDNA that is known to mutate at a
faster rate than other regions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#107:1>
This is called the control region.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#108:1>
<w> Vigilant's </w> study also validated <w> Cann's </w> finding
that African lineages were the oldest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#109:1>
But <w> Vigilant's </w> research did not end there.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#110:1>
She compared the amount of diversity among the different African
mDNA with the diversity between African mDNA and the mDNA of a chimpanzee.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#111:1>
The chimpanzee was chosen as an animal model for relatedness because
there is now universal consensus that they split off the human line some 5
million years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#112:1>
The time span is thus known.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#113:1>
Analyses revealed that the chimp mDNA and human mDNA had diverged 42
per cent during these 5 million years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#114:1>
This gives a divergence rate of about 8.4 per cent per million
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#115:1>
The most intriguing finding was that the divergence among the
African types was just 2 per cent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#116:1>
On the scale of the molecular clock this would translate to 250,000
years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-038#117:1>
The figure is undoubtedly very close to the magical 200,000 years
that is <quote> ` <w> Even's </w> ' </quote> age. </p> </I>
