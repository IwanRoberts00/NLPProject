IN LEH garden pea can be sown from the first week of May to mid
June in flat land.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#4:1>
In plains, it is sown in rabi season from the beginning of October to
the middle of November and from the middle of March to the end of May on the
lower hills and a second crop is also sown in the autum.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#5:1>
However, early maturing pea varieties may be sown from August and
onward in lower hills. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#6:1>
Sixty to 80 kg seed should be sown in one hectare but varieties of
small grain type should be sown at the rate of 100 to 120 kg per hectare.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#7:1>
The row to row and plant to plant distance should be kept 25-30 cm and
2.5 cm, respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#8:1>
The depth of sowing the seed varies from 2.5 to 5.00 cm according to
soil moisture.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#9:1>
But it is necessary to sow all seeds at the same depth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#10:1>
Uneven germination of the seed results in wide variation in maturity
of pea at harvest time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#11:1>
<h> <ul> SEED TREATMENT </ul> </h> : For better germination,
especially for the wrinkled varieties, soak the seed in water overnight.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#12:1>
In the new field where the pea crop has not been grown earlier the
inoculation of Rhizobium sp. in the soils is recommended for better growth.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#13:1>
<h> <bold> FERTILIZER: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#14:1>
Depending on the fertility of the soil the following manure and
fertilizers should be incorporated in the soil per hectare: 15 to 20 metric
tonns of thoroughly decomposed Farmyard Manure ( FYM), 20 to 50 kg of
nitrogen in the form of ammonium sulphate, 30 to 80 kg of potash in the form
of potassium sulphate and 50 to 60 kg of phosphorus in the form of single
superphosphate.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#15:1>
The complete dose FYM may be thoroughly mixed up with the soil at the
time of field preparation, whereas the whole quantity of potash and
phosphorus may be applied before sowing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#16:1>
Half of the ammonium sulphate should be applied at the early growth
period for stimulating early growth of peas and the other half just at
flowering stage by top dressing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#17:1>
<h> <bold> VARIETIES: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#18:1>
Though various hybrid / composite / selection varieties have been
made by scientists but there are two main kinds of cultivated peas available,
<O> <&> page </&> 14 </O> the large and smooth seeded peas and wrinkled
seeded field peas.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#19:1>
The wrinkled seeded varieties are sweeter.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#20:1>
The variety UD-2, Arkel and Bonneville are found to have high
yielding potentialities for Leh ( J & K) area. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#21:1>
<h> <bold> INTERCULTURAL OPERATIONS: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#22:1>
Pea also requires regular soil moisture but the frequency of
irrigation is much less than other vegetable crops.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#23:1>
For, frequent irrigations often tend to increase vegetative growth at
the expense of pod formation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#24:1>
If there is less moisture in the light soil, the crop should be
irrigated immediately after sowing.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#25:1>
In heavy soils the sowing should be done when enough of soil moisture
is available.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#26:1>
The annual rainfall in Leh-Ladakh area is very less, therefore, if
there is no rainfall during pod filling stage, the plants must be provided
with an irrigation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#27:1>
Since most of the cultivated land of Leh is sandy loam, no irrigation
is necessary after 4-6 days interval but in heavy soil, irrigation should be
done after 8-10 days interval.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#28:1>
However, it always depends upon the weather condition and rainfall.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#29:1>
Hoeing should be done to keep down weeds and provide good aeration
for proper development of the roots and beneficial nitrogen fixing bacteria.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#30:1>
<h> <bold> HARVESTING: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#31:1>
Garden peas must be picked at the proper stage of maturity, because
they start loosing their quality rapidly after reaching the edible stage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#32:1>
At this stage the pod turns dark to light green and the grains are
well filled up in the pod.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#33:1>
The quality of pea is tested by its tenderness and high sugar
content.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#34:1>
The deterioration is hastened if the temperature is high at the time
of harvesting.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#35:1>
Therefore, the picking should be done either early in the morning or
late in the afternoon so that the quality may not go down due to the heat of
noon.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#36:1>
Pod may be picked up about 60 days, 75 days and 100 days after sowing
according to early, medium and late varieies.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#37:1>
At the time of picking, care should be taken not to tear or jerk the
plants so that they may not be injured and get partially dried up or stop
bearing pods.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#38:1>
Three or four pickings are done during the season.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#39:1>
An interval of 7 to 10 days may be kept between the two pickings.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#40:1>
<h> <bold> YIELD: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#41:1>
The yield of green pod varies with the variation in agro-climatic
conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#42:1>
However, it has been estimated that green pod yield per hectare in
India on the whole is about 43 to 50 quintals.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#43:1>
But varieties UD-2, Arkel and Bonneville have yielded green pod in
the experimental field of Field Research Laboratory.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#44:1>
Leh ( J & K) of DRDO 70, 80 and 85 quintals per hectare,
respectively. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#46:1>
<h> <bold> Powdery mildew: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#47:1>
In Leh, powdery mildew caused by fungus eraiphepolygoni is the main
disease which appears from the second week of August; it may be a little
earlier or late depending upon rainfall.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#48:1>
The leaves producing faint, slightly discoloured spikes; from which
greyish white powdery spots spread over leaf, stem and pod.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#49:1>
Later on, the leaves become yellow and die whereas fruits either do
not set or remain small.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#50:1>
It can be easily controlled by dusting the crop with fine sulphur at
the rate of 25 to 30 kg / ha at 10 to 15 days interval or by spraying sulfex
( 0. 2% ) or Karathane ( 0.1 % ) twice at 15 days interval as long as
symptoms are present. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#51:1>
<h> <bold> Fusarium wilt: </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#52:1>
This is also a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxyoporum Pisi.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#53:1>
The infection gets in through the roots.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#54:1>
The leaves eventually turn yellow and curl downwards.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#55:1>
The pods do not fill properly.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#56:1>
In severe cases, no pod formation takes place and whole plant wilts
and stem shrivels.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#57:1>
Fortunately, this disease is not generally found in Leh.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#58:1>
However, the control measure is either to follow long rotation or to
use resistant varieties.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#59:1>
The seed treatment and drenching the plants with Brassical ( 0.2 % )
help in controlling this disease. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#60:1>
<h> <bold> Pod borer ( Helothis sp. ) : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#61:1>
Among pests, pod borer may sometime cause damage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#62:1>
The young caterpillors first feed on the surface of the pod, bore
into them and feed on the seeds rendering the pods unfit for consumption.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#63:1>
It can be controlled by spraying of 0.1 % solution of Malathion or by
dusting of 5 % BHC at 20 to 25 kg per hectare or by spraying of 0.2 % DDT
suspension at 670 to 900 litres per hectare. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 15 <O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#69:2>
Cheesed out, <w> that's </w> what!

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#70:2>
There are at least 1,746 varieties of cheese known to us ( besides
assorted others cropping up now and then ) .

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#71:2>
Largely processed from the milk of cow, sheep, goat or buffalo, some
local varieties are also made from the milk of the yak, zebu, reindeer, mare,
ass, even camel!

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#72:2>
The nutritional quality of cheese depends on the kind of milk used -
- cow milk cheese is the most nourishing of all.

<h> <bold> CHEESE DOWN THE AGES </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#75:2>
An ancient yarn has it that cheese was discovered accidentally -
- when a traveller in a desert put milk in his primitive canteen ( made from
the stomach of one of his domesticated animals ) .

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#76:2>
At night, while drinking the milk, he found instead a trickle of sour
curd.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#77:2>
Tearing open the bag, he found the milk had coagulated.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#78:2>
Perhaps the continuous movement of his mount and the desert heat had
separated the curd and whey.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#79:2>
And <w> that's </w> how primitive cheese was discovered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#80:2>
The Iraqis used cheese as part of their staple diet as far back
as 7000 B. C.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#81:2>
It is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament too.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#82:2>
Nomads made cheese by storing surplus milk in suspended bags, which
would then curdle because of the <O> <*> black square</*> FEMINA JUNE 1, 1997
<*> black square </*> <&> page </&> 77 </O> warm climate.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#83:2>
And when these bags swayed on the animals during journeys, the acidic
curd would break down to produce curd and whey.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#84:2>
When a handful of salt was added to preserve the curd, it became
cheese - - a high protein food to supplement the meagre meat of nomads, who
spread the art of making cheese. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#85:2>
The way we make <indig> <quote> ` paneer' </quote> </indig> (
cottage cheese ) at home - - by squeezing lime into milk - - is a pantomime
of what our ancestors did.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#86:2>
They would coagulate the milk, using rennets from the hare and kid (
considered better than that from the lamb ) , milk from the fig tree branch,
vinegar, the thistle flower, the seed of the bastard saffron and, even the
extract of green pineapples! </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#87:2>
The art of cheese making was traditionally handed down the
generations by word of mouth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#88:2>
The misunderstandings that followed from this, on occasion, led to
new varieties of cheese!

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#89:2>
Which wasn't very difficult, considering there were as many milks to
choose from as rennets.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#90:2>
Also, diverse additives used during cheese making gave rise to newer
kinds.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#91:2>
These varied from traditional herbs, spices and nuts to beer, wines
and liqueurs! </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#92:2>
<h> <bold> CHEESING KINDS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#93:2>
Cheese is basically of four types; Soft, semi-soft, firm and
hard.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#94:2>
The first includes the unripened and fresh type of cheese that most
people know as cottage cheese, cream cheese, pot or ricotta.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#95:2>
More sophisticated soft types that ripen in a matter of days inlcude
Brie, Camembert and the so-called double and triple creams.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#96:2>
These develop thin, downy white crusts and have tender, almost fluid,
insides.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#97:2>
The semi-soft cheeses are those ripened with bacteria and yeast, and
include Brick, Munster, Liederkranz, Limburger and Port Salut.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#98:2>
Blue-veined cheeses like Ruquefort and Gorgonzola also belong to this
category.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#99:2>
Firm cheeses include Cheddar, Cheshire, Lancashire, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#100:2>
Cheddar, probably the best known cheese in the world, originated in
Cheddar ( England ) in 1500 A. D.!

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#101:2>
This firm bodied cheese is, today, considered a cheaper source of
high value protein - - it contains 25 per cent protein ( compared to the 20
per cent in meat and eight per cent in bread ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#103:2>
The cheese available in the market has all the goodness of milk
in it and more.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#104:2>
So, people allergic to lactose ( in <O> photograph </O> <O> caption
</O> milk ) can safely eat cheese, since most of the lactose is lost during
the processing ( unless, of course, <w> it's </w> the very soft, fresh,
unripened variety ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-018#105:2>
Casein is the main protein in cheese.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#106:2>
Among the other nutrients, cheese contains appreciable amounts of
calcium and phosphorus, which help in bone and tooth formation. </p>

Also while baking, grilling or pot cooking, always remember that
strong heat is not good for cheese.

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#115:2>
However, while frying, since the cheese is normally covered or
coated, it can withstand heat without getting spoilt. </p> <*> star </*>

<ICE-IND:W2D-018#116:2>
When a recipe specifically requires sliced cheese, thin slices
are advisable because they melt more easily.
