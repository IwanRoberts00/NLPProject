<ICE-IND:S2B-024#1:1:A>
Familiar incidents <,,> do not usually excite our <,> curiosity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#2:1:A>
We look at them <,,> and we take them for granted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#3:1:A>
We do not ask <,> what makes them <,> happen <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#4:1:A>
How they are connected with the rest <,> of the universe <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#5:1:A>
It was <,> one of these mundane incidents <,,> which excited the  
curiosity <,> of <,> Issac Newton <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#6:1:A>
He saw <,> an apple fall from a tree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#7:1:A>
It made him wonder <,,> whether the law of nature that made the  
apple fall <,,> would also make the moon <,,> fall towards the earth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#8:1:A>
He was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple <,> to the  
moon <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#9:1:A>
He was not content <,> with having seen this event with his physical  
eyes alone <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#10:1:A>
He was trying <,> to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon  
<,> with his <,> intellect <,,> the third eye <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#11:1:A>
What is the connection <,> that Newton saw <,> betweeen the apple  
and the moon <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#12:1:A>
Let us look at the moon <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#13:1:A>
If the earth <,> did not attract the moon <,,> the moon would have  
travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#14:1:A>
The <w> earth's </w> attraction provides the centripidal force <,>  
that bends the <w> moon's </w> projectory <,> continuously <,> from its  
linear projectory <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#15:1:A>
One can therefore say <,> that the moon is continuously falling  
towards the <w> earth's </w> centre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#16:1:A>
It is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft <,> that we  
talked about in an earlier episode 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#17:1:A>
Now <,> if the <w> earth's </w> gravity extends <,> upto the orbit  
of the moon <,> and this force decreases <,> as the square of the distance  
from the <w> earth's </w> centre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#18:1:A>
It is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls  
<,,> from a knowledge of the acceleration of the apple <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#19:1:A>
Since the moon is sixty times <,> as far from the centre of the  
earth as the apple <,,> its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty  
that is <,> three thousand six hundred times smaller <,> than the <w> apple's  
</w> acceleration <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#20:1:A>
The remarkable thing is <,> that this gives the right answer for  
the moon to go <,> once round the earth in twenty-eight days <,> exactly as  
observed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#21:1:A>
This was <w> Newton's </w> <,> famous <,> moon test <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#22:1:A>
In fact in the beginning <,> he used a slightly wrong value for the  
distance of the moon from the centre of the earth <,> and therefore got <,> a  
slightly wrong value for the lunar month <,,> that made him wonder for a  
while as to whether <,> there was something other than gravity <,> which  
affected the <w> moon's </w> motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#23:1:A>
He therefore didn't publish his results until much later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#24:1:A>
The primitive concept of forces <,,> arises from our experience of  
<,> pushes and pulls <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#25:1:A>
Newton made a tremendous intellectual leap <,> from such a concept  
of contact forces <,> to the concept of forces <,> such as gravitation <,>  
which act over a distance through empty space <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#26:1:A>
This is how he made <,> the leap <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#27:1:A>
Consider the uniform inertial motion of a body <,> in a straight  
line <,,> covering equal distances AB <,> BC <,> CD <,> DE and so on <,> in  
equal times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#28:1:A>
Let the points <mention> A B C D E </mention> etcetera <,> be  
joined by a straight line <,> to the point P <,> not on the line of motion  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#29:1:A>
Then <,> the successive triangles <,> all have equal bases <,> AB  
<,> BC <,> CD <,> DE <,> etcetera <,> and the same height <,,> H <,> from the  
base <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#30:1:A>
Therefore <,,> they all have the same area <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#31:1:A>
Since these equal areas are swept out in equal times <,,> this is  
clear that inertial motion <,> traces out equal areas in equal times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#32:1:A>
Now Newton supposed <,> that the body received a succession of  
blows <,> at regular intervals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#33:1:A>
All directed towards a common point <,> P <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#34:1:A>
Then the direction of motion would change at every blow <,> and the  
body would coast along inertially in a straight line <,> between these blows  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#35:1:A>
The linear path would thus be converted into a polygon <,> whose  
sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas <,> with  
respect to the point P <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#36:1:A>
Now says Newton <,> let the time between successive blows become  
smaller and smaller <,> then the number of blows and triangles would increase  
<,> and the width <,> would decrease <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#37:1:A>
In the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time <,> the  
projectory would be a continuous curve <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#38:1:A>
This is the crucial point <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#39:1:A>
It lies at the very heart of calculus <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#40:1:A>
This limiting procedure enabled Newton to make a transition <,>  
from a succession of discrete blows <,> to the concept of a continually  
acting force <,> directed towards a common point <,> a central or centripidal  
force causing curvilinear motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#41:1:A>
And he discovered <,> that bodies moving under the action of such a  
force would trace out equal areas in equal times <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#42:1:A>
This is <w> Keplar's </w> second law of planetary motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#43:1:A>
Notice that Newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force  
acting over a distance <,> as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct  
impact <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#44:1:A>
He wrote <,,> <quote> what I call attraction <,> may be performed  
by impulse <,> or by some other means unknown to me <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#45:1:A>
I use these words here to signify in general <,> any force <,> by  
which bodies <,> tend towards one another <,> whatsoever be the cause  
</quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#46:1:A>
He didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#47:1:A>
Could it be due to <,> a shower of ethereal particles <,,> or was  
it is as Descartes had imagined <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#48:1:A>
Newton was curious <,,> but he couldn't decide <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#49:1:A>
He left the question <,,> open <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#50:1:A>
But what is important is that he didn't stop there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#51:1:A>
He simply assumed the existance of gravity <,> and proceeded to  
work out its consequences <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#52:1:A>
This pragmatic approach <,> was <,> essential for the progress of  
science in his time <,,> but it was completely misunderstood <,> by many of  
his eminent contemporaries <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#53:1:A>
It led to <,> a lot of unnecessary and bitter controversy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#54:1:A>
Having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make  
a body move in a curve <,> that traced out equal areas in equal times <,,> he  
also proved the converse <,> namely that this area law employed a motion in a  
central force speed <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#55:1:A>
Since the area law held for planets <,> it became clear to Newton  
that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#56:1:A>
He had earlier deduced from <w> Keplar's </w> third law of  
planetary motion <,> that a circular orbit employed a force <,> that  
decreased as the square of the distance from the centre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#57:1:A>
Armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show <,>  
that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance <,> a  
planet would describe <,> an elliptic orbit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#58:1:A>
In other words <,> he derived <w> Keplar's </w> first law of  
planetary motion <,> from causal principles <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#59:1:A>
Now <,> this derivation of <w> Keplar's </w> empirical laws <,>  
held only for an imagined system <,> a hypothetical point particle <,> moving  
around a centre of force <,> in a perfect vacuum <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#60:1:A>
The real world is of course much more complex <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#61:1:A>
Newton therefore didn't publish his results <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#62:1:A>
In the mean time <,> Robert Hook quite independently hit upon the  
idea <,> that the attraction between the sun and the planets <,> fell off at  
the square of their distances <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#63:1:A>
However <,> he couldn't work out <,> what the orbits would be under  
such an attractive force <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#64:1:A>
He tried to get Newton interested in the problem <,> and wrote to  
him in January sixteen hundred and eighty <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#65:1:A>
But Newton didn't reply <,> as an earlier controversy with Hook  
about the nature of light <,> had offended him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#66:1:A>
In London <,> there were two other men <,> who were <,> also  
working on <w> Hook's </w> problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#67:1:A>
Christopher Wren <,> the famous architect of Saint <w> Paul's </w>  
Cathedral <,> and Edmund Halley <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#68:1:A>
In August sixteen eighty-four <,,> Halley <,> who was younger than  
Hook and more tactful <,,> went to Cambridge on horseback <,> to find out if  
Newton could help <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#69:1:A>
A contemporary account <,> states <,> without mentioning either his  
own speculations <,> or those of Hook or Wren <,> he at once indicated the  
object of his visit by asking Newton <,> what would be the curve described by  
the planets on the supposition <,> that gravity <,> diminished at the square  
of the distance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#70:1:A>
Newton immediately answered <,> an ellips <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#71:1:A>
Struck with joy and amazement <,> Halley asked him how he knew it  
<,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#72:1:A>
Why replied he <,,> I have calculated it <,,> and being asked for  
the calculation <,> he could not find it <,> but <,> promised to send it to  
him <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#73:1:A>
This was the beginning <,> of the writing of <w> Newton's </w>  
Principia <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#74:1:A>
Perhaps the greatest book on physical science <,> ever written <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#75:1:A>
It took him nearly <,> three years of incredible labour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#76:1:A>
He submitted it to the Royal Society on twenty-eighth April  
sixteen eighty-six <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#77:1:A>
One of the greatest days in the history of science <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#78:1:A>
It was finally accepted by Samuel Peeps <,> the president of the  
Royal Society <,> and published in sixteen eithty-seven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#79:1:A>
It would not have seen the light of day <,> had it not been for the  
constant coaxing and persuasion by Halley <,> who even paid for its  
publication <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#80:1:A>
It consisted of three books <,> written in Latin <,> in which <,>  
Newton developed a full dynamical theory <,> encapsulated in his three laws  
of motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#81:1:A>
The third law is the most original <,> of his three laws <,,> and  
appears for the first time in the Principia <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#82:1:A>
Newton <,> generalised the experience of <,> direct collisions of  
bodies like <,> billiard balls acting mutually on one another <,> to the case  
<,> of four types of forces <,> including attraction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#83:1:A>
The third law <,> is not however applicable to every case <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#84:1:A>
Nowadays we believe <,> that all signals or forces have a finite  
velocity of propagation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#85:1:A>
It is therefore not applicable to them <,> because <,> it talks  
about <,> forces of action and reaction being equal <,> as measured at the  
same time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#86:1:A>
We therefore don't expect it to be very good <,> say in the case of  
atomic category <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#87:1:A>
It is however perfectly applicable <,> to the collisions of  
billiard balls <,> cars and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#88:1:A>
As I have said earlier <,,> <w> Newton's </w> derivation of <w>  
Kepler's </w> empirical laws <,> held only for an imagined system <,> a  
hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force <,> in a  
perfect vacuum <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#89:1:A>
A physically impressed force <,,> must be directed towards a real  
physical body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#90:1:A>
So Newton next introduced a second body in place of the  
mathematical centre of force <,> to simulate the sun <,> and a single planet  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#91:1:A>
And he assumed <,> that they were both spherical in shape <,> and  
attracted each other with equal and opposite forces <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#92:1:A>
After much effort lasting over a number of years <,> Newton  
obtained the remarkable mathematical result <,,> that a gravitational  
attraction <,> of a homogeneous spherical body or shell <,> on a mass point  
outside it <,> was the same as though its whole mass <,> was concentrated at  
its centre <,,> provided <,> gravity fell off at the square of the distance  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#93:1:A>
This justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as  
<,> point like objects <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#94:1:A>
He next showed that in such a system <,> each body would move in an  
orbit around the common centre of mass <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#95:1:A>
If one of the bodies were much more massive than the other <,> as  
is the case with the sun and most of the planets <,> the centre of mass would  
practically coincide <,> with the more massive body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#96:1:A>
Since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated  
in the sun <,,> the planet would really move around the sun <,,> which would  
remain practically stationary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#97:1:A>
A dynamical justification of the Copernican system <,> that Galileo  
was unable to provide <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#98:1:A>
The final feature was the introduction of other mutually  
interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun <,> and all its planets  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#99:1:A>
Here <,> his third law about the equality of action and reaction  
played a crucial role <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#100:1:A>
The discovery of this new important principle <,> almost  
inevitably led to universal gravitation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#101:1:A>
Newton systematically showed <,> that the same force of gravity  
that acted between the earth and the moon <,> also acted between <,> Jupiter  
and its satellites <,> between the sun <,> and all the planets <,> and  
between every pair of planets <,> and that every action was mutual <,> by the  
third law of motion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#102:1:A>
He was thus led to the concept of <,> universal gravitation <,> a  
force <,> that acts mutually between any two samples of matter <,> anywhere  
in the universe <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#103:1:A>
Newton applied his powerful theory to show <,,> that the tides on  
the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull <,> of the moon and the  
sun <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#104:1:A>
He argued <,> that the gravitational force exerted by the moon <,>  
on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth <,> was stronger <,>  
than the pull on the moonless side <,> because gravity decreases the distance  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#105:1:A>
As a result of this <,> the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape  
<,> with two bulges <,> one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite  
side <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#106:1:A>
The sun has a similar effect on the oceans <,,> but being much  
farther away its effect is weaker than the <w> moon's </w> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#107:1:A>
Also the solar and lunar tides <,> do not always coincide <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#108:1:A>
The sun and the moon <,> act in the same direction whenever the  
moon is either new or full <,> and then we have exceptionally high tides <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#109:1:A>
At other times <,> the total effect is much diminished <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#110:1:A>
With the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to  
his daring imagination <,,> Newton <,> demonstrated convincingly that <,>  
gravity held sway <,> over the entire solar system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#111:1:A>
In one sweeping stroke <,,> he unified celestial and terrestrial  
motion under a single concept <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#112:1:A>
The great Irish philosopher <,> George Bernard Shaw once made <,>  
the following <,> mischievous remark <,> about Newton <,,> <quote> Copernicus  
proved <,> that Ptolemy was wrong <,> Kepler proved <,> that Copernicus was  
wrong <,,> Galileo proved <,> that Aristotle was wrong <,> but at that point  
<,> the sequence broke down <,> because <,> science then came up for the  
first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon <,> and Englishman  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#113:1:A>
To explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent  
<,> he invented a force called gravitation <,> and thus erected a complete  
<,> British universe and established it as a religion <,> which was devoutly  
believed in for three hundred years </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#114:1:A>
That was <,> George Bernard Shaw <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-024#115:1:A>
But the famous English poet <,> Alexander Pope <,> wrote <,,>  
<quote> Nature <,,> and <w> nature's </w> laws lay hidden in night <,,> God  
said <,> let Newton be <,,> and all was light </quote> <,,> </I>
