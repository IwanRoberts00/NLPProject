<indig> BANDHA </indig> AND OTHER DECORATIVE DESIGNS

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#3:1>
The Orissan Baandha art is one of the decorative designs and the
different States of India have their comparable textile designs also.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#4:1>
Gujrat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Padesh, Kashmir, Andhra,
Tamilnadu etc. are some of these States which have earned good name and
reputation in such decorative designs and have created markets in the
countries outside India for their beautiful products.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#5:1>
We review here briefly of the most famous of such designs with a view
to comparing them with the Orissan Baandha art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#8:1>
These fabrics have especially been produced in Machhilipattanam
and Shrikaalahastri of Andhra Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#9:1>

<quote> " Indian <indig> Kalamkari </indig> " </quote> published by
the All India Handloom Board states as follows: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#12:1>
<quote> " The printed calicos of South India are known as <indig>
<quote> ` Kalamkari' </quote> </indig> as they are produced by <indig> Kalam
</indig> or brush <+> " </+> </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#13:1>
The most important places producing <indig> Kalamkaries </indig> are
Machhilipattanam and Srikaalahasti in Andhra Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#14:1>
The art is also alive very sparsely in Tanjavoor District of
Tamillnadu. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#15:1>
Machhilipattanam is famous for <indig> palampores </indig> (
flowered chints).

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#16:1>
These are usually used as curtains, bed-sheets, canopies, prayer
mats, pillow slips and table cloths.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#17:1>
The patterns are tree of life motif with birds perching on the
branches and animals lying below the sheltering shade of the trees,
geometrical designs and <indig> mirhab </indig> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#18:1>
The <indig> Palampores </indig> in Srikaalahastri are painted
with mythological scenes and are full of descriptions of these in the local
language. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#19:1>
These painted cloths are intended for use as temple canopies and
wall hangings. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 27 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#20:1>
In <indig> Kalamkari </indig> printing there is no harshness or
abruptness.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#21:1>
On the other hand, they flow one into the other with an aesthetic
simplicity making the whole surface a fascinating one.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#22:1>
In the perfect harmony and distribution of the colouring lies the
triumph of the <indig> Kalamkari </indig> craftsman.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#23:1>
The colours are never harsh or gaudy.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#24:1>
These colours are natural with depth and brilliance of glowing
jewels.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#25:1>
The <indig> Kalamkari </indig> <w> artist's </w> brushwork on
cloth makes one remember <w> nature's </w> artistry on the wings of a
butterfly. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#26:1>
<indig> Kalamkari </indig> of Machhilipattanam is locally called
<indig> Addakam </indig> and of Srikaalahasti as <indig> Rathapaani </indig> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#27:1>
From this it is quite evident that the <indig> Kalamkari </indig>
is painting and printing work on the cloth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#28:1>
It can not have spectrums on each and every end or pick of silk or
cotton yarn and both the sides, i.e. face and back are not equal. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#29:1>
<h> ( ii) <indig> <it> HIMRU </it> </indig> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#31:1>

fabrics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#32:1>
The present <indig> Himru </indig> designs are woven with the art
silk yarn onthe cotton cloth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#33:1>
It takes five times more for the weaver to form an <quote> ` extra
figuring weft design' </quote> of five colours on a fabric.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#34:1>
Like that, he needs the help of draw-harness for having different
shades.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#35:1>
In the opinion of some people the work <indig> Himru </indig> is
derived from <indig> Ham </indig> ( means own) + <indig> Ru </indig> ( means
self) so; it means <quote> ` own self' </quote> or the <quote> ` shadow'
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#36:1>
Apart from stoles and blouses, <indig> Himru </indig> makes
original furnishing materials, <indig> sherwani </indig> etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#140:1>
The <indig> Baandha </indig> ( tie and dye) art of Orissa is
unique compared to the decorative designs of other States of India.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#141:1>
Varanasi Brocade, Jamdanee and Baluchar of West Bengal are formed or
woven on cloth by <indig> Jala </indig> , Jacquard and needle works.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#142:1>
The <indig> Kalamkari </indig> printing and painting works of
Machhilipattanam and Shrikalahasti of Andhra Pradesh are achieved by printing
and painting with a sort of <indig> Kalam </indig> or brush. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#143:1>
The Pashmina shawl of Kashmir has wonderful designs by the
needle works.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#144:1>
But excepting the <indig> Kalamkari </indig> printing, other designs
need extra and different coloured yarns to get them on the fabrics.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#145:1>
Again, the face and back of these designs are different.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#146:1>
But the <indig> Baandha </indig> is an art that does not need extra
yarn for its design.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#147:1>
The same yarn of the fabric, warp or weft, has the design.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#148:1>
Secondly, its face and back are exactly the same.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#149:1>
If a picture of swan is shown on one side of the cloth in <indig>
Baandha </indig> work, then exactly the same <O> <&> page </&> 33 </O>
picture of swan will be found on the back side.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#150:1>
This sort of peculiarity and speciality attract the lovers of
textile art in India and outside. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#151:1>
The preparation of this <indig> Baandha </indig> yarn may, in
brief, be described as follows. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#152:1>
<quote> " Before the warp and weft threads are interlaced to
produce the cloth, the threads, generally the weft, and some times the warp
and tied in portions according to the designs and then dyed resulting in the
united portions being coloured. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#153:1>
To develop another colour in the design the coloured portions
are tied and portions on which the second colour has to be developed are
united and dyed in the second dye.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#154:1>
In this manner a number of colours are developed.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#155:1>
These threads are so woven that the desired design becomes prominent
on the cloth on both sides being equally bright. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-020#156:1>
Design produced in this method differ from printed and jacquard
woven designs as the figures by the later processes can be had only on one
side of the cloth.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#157:1>
<indig> Baandha </indig> method requires highly skilled workmanship
and offers unlimited scope of designing" </quote> . </p>

<p>

The <indig> <it> Pagdubaandhu, Buddabhaasi </it> </indig> or
<indig> <it> Chitki </it> </indig> of Andhra Pradesh have, however, certain
likeness with the <indig> Baandha </indig> art, the former being like the
latter tie and dye designs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-020#159:1>
The following places of Andhra Pradesh are noted for this work; viz
- - Pochampally, Koyalgudem, Chowtuppala, Siripuram, Bhubangiri, Chuigottal,
