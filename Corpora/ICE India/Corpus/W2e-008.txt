<h> <bold> Fear Of The Polls </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#2:1>
The extent to which an apathetic attitude towards democratic
institutions has permeated <w> Gujarat's </w> body politic has again become
evident from the recent decision to put off the local body elections.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#3:1>
This is the fourth time that they have been postponed even after both
the ruling Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party had loudly
proclaimed that they were keen to see grassroots democracy flourish in
accordance with the new law that allows reservation for all the weaker
sections, including women.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#4:1>
Although the government has said that it was merely re-scheduling
the polls as the current <quote> " unprecedented floods" </quote> would not
permit the villagers in remote areas to exercise their voting rights, the
real reason for the BJP agreeing to the proposal to postpone the elections
lay elsewhere.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#5:1>
If the divided Congress is unsure of the outcome, the BJP, which had
earlier campaigned against such postponements and once even went to the court
on this issue, now finds itself on somewhat uncertain ground since its temple
card has not yielded the expected political dividends in the assembly
elections and by-elections held elsewhere.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#6:1>
Gujarat is among the few states in India where local body polls have
been held more or less regularly and, despite the fact that the village and
taluka-level <indig> panchayats </indig> continue to be dominated by the
upper castes, the rural institutions have played a major role in giving a
place in the power structure to people belonging to the lower and
intermediate castes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#7:1>
It was hoped, therefore, that with the proposed reservations for the
backward castes and the women coming into effect, the <indig> panchayati raj
</indig> system would get a shot in the arm and help to empower the weaker
sections in a more effective manner. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#8:1>
The postponement, however, only goes to show that if a powerful
section of the Congress, owing allegiance to Chimanbhai Patel, has failed to
come to terms with the new leadership, the BJP, too, is not too confident
about its future prospects.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#9:1>
Having entered into an alliance with the powerful landed gentry, known
in Gujarat as the Patel lobby, the BJP could successfully enter the civic and
<indig> panchayat </indig> bodies in the 1986-87 polls, held in the wake of
the worst-ever caste war that led to the ouster of the Madhavsinh Solanki
ministry.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#10:1>
Now, with the Ram card receding into the background, however, and no
fresh issues at hand that can enthuse its traditional urban upper caste
supporters, there is a feeling in the BJP that a set-back in the local
body polls can have a demoralising effect on the party cadres during the
campaign for the assembly elections next year.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#11:1>
Indeed, the postponement decision shows how little the political
parties care about the democratic aspirations of the ordinary people.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#12:1>
Because of the postponement, the municipal corporation in Ahmedabad,
Baroda, Surat, Rajkot and Bhavnagar will be ruled by bureaucrats for 18 long
months for the first time in <w> Gujarat's </w> history. </p> <*> a dark line

<h> <bold> France In Rwanda </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#14:1>
<w> France's </w> intervention in Rwanda comes at a time when the
international community is conspicuous by its absence in a country where a
brutal civil war has claimed more than half a million lives since April.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#15:1>
But instead of winning general applause, the French decision is
being viewed askance not just in Rwanda but also in the Organisation of
African Unity countries and by most of <w> France's </w> European allies.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#16:1>
The strongest opposition has come from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (
RPF), led by the minority Tutsis, the victims of attacks by the Hutus.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#17:1>
The RPF sees the intervention as a calculated move by the French to
bolster the Hutu government at a time when the RPF appears to be gaining the
upper hand.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#18:1>
Even though France has billed its Operation Turquoise as a strictly
humanitarian response to the carnage, with specific and limited objectives,
it faces a credibility problem, given its record of political and military
support to the Hutu regime of the assassinated President, Juvenal
Habyarimana.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#19:1>
Among its European allies, <w> France's </w> move is seen as an
attempt to score a point over Belgium, a former colonial power in Rwanda,
which has refused to get involved.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#20:1>
The French initiative can also have the effect of shoring up other
discredited regimes in Africa, notably President <w> Mobutu's </w> in Zaire.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#21:1>
If <w> France's </w> hands are none too clean, nor are those of
<w> Rwanda's </w> former colonial masters.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#22:1>
In fact, the origins of <w> today's </w> savagery in Rwanda can be
traced back to the attempts of its European rulers, Germany and Belgium, to
impose antagonistic ethnic identities on communities that spoke the same
language and shared the same territory.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#23:1>
The minority Tutsis were bestowed with a superior racial status and
the majority Hutus consigned to a life of poverty and denied political and
educational opportunities.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#24:1>
At the time of independence in 1959, the Belgians helped to turn the
tide in the popular uprising and installed a Hutu government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#25:1>
The conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis is therefore essentially a
political one.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#26:1>
It is a measure of the failure of the western world, especially the
U.N., that it has viewed the tragedy in Rwanda as an ethnic war and, wary of
getting embroiled in a Somalia-type quagmire, desisted from even minimal
intervention.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#27:1>
To that extent, France has reason to congratulate itself for
embarking on a thankless and dangerous mission.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#28:1>
But unless western and African intermediaries make a renewed effort
toward political reconciliation between the Hutus and Tutsis, French
intervention is unlikely to bring about an end to <w> Rwanda's </w> trauma.

<h> <bold> The Bottom Line </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#30:1>
Autobiography, said the writer Philip Guedella, <quote> " is at
bottom an unrivalled vehicle for telling the truth - - about other people"
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#31:1>
But publishers say that the bottom has fallen out of the memoirs and
biography market, with everyone wanting to get into the act, and readers
ending up confused with six different <quote> " authentic, first-hand,
eye-witness accounts" </quote> of the same event.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#32:1>
Since scandal-power and controversy help sales, the former Australian
prime minister, Mr Bob Hawke, known as the <quote> " Mouth" </quote> for his
rich repertoire of somewhat unparliamentary words and profane adjectives, is
the answer to the prayers of publishers.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#33:1>
In his forthcoming autobiography, Mr Hawke, whom many thought of
as a backnumber in the political outbacks, has revealed that his successor,
Labour Party colleague and prime minister, Mr Paul Keathing, once described
Australia to him as <quote> " the arseend of the world" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#34:1>
Wags might say the <quote> " bum rap" </quote> is nothing new in the
antipodes, where even the original inhabitants once exposed their <it>
derrieres </it> to visiting royalty, as a symbol of their protest against
official policy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#35:1>
Mr Hawke, getting to the bottom of it, said the present Prime
Minister used the expression four years ago when Mr Paul Keating threatened
he would migrate to Europe, bag and baggage, unless Mr Hawke yielded to him
<quote> " his turn as majority Labour Party leader and <w> Australia's </w>
Prime Minister" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#36:1>
Sources close to Mr Hawke also charge that Prime Minister Keating
denigrated the people <quote> " down under" </quote> as <quote> " lingering
stereotypes of gormless men and shrimps on the barbecue" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#37:1>
The Australian prime minister has, of course, vehemently denied the
Hawkish remarks of his predecessor as <quote> " deeply offensive and
defamatory" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#38:1>
He admits, however, that <quote> " it might have been a reference to
a shorthand way of saying that Australia is way out of the northern
hemisphere and hence has to work hard to be competitive" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#39:1>
Labour Party supporters of Mr Keating plead that the rear view was
merely a <quote> " geographical expression and in no way anatomical" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#40:1>
Mr Keating has often derided <w> Australia's </w> opposition National
and Liberal parties as <quote> " un-Australian scum-bags" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#41:1>
They are getting their own back now by calling Mr Keating unpatriotic
and deriding the ruling party for washing their own dirty linen in public.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#42:1>
Wags who have an unflagging interest in political muck-raking at the
say Mr <w> Keating's </w> remarks should end the acrimony over a new flag for
Australia.

<h> <bold> Reprieve For Pawar </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#45:2>
Mr Sharad <w> Pawar's </w> belief that the people of Maharashtra
who <quote> " know me for the last 20 to 30 years" </quote> will bail him out
of his current troubles may or may not be correct, but his meeting with the
Prime Minister with at least ensure that the sniping at him from within the
party will be less virulent even if it does not stop altogether.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#46:2>
There is little doubt that his detractors within the party were
delighted at his discomfiture and made the most of the <quote> " politically
unwise" </quote> act of suspending Mr G.R. Khairnar.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#47:2>
Their reaction was fully in keeping with the <w> Congress's </w>
internal politics which forces virtually all major leaders to be as much on
guard against their party colleagues as against the adversaries outside.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#48:2>
Given the manner in which Mr Pawar had established himself after his
<w> predecessor's </w> bungling during the Bombay riots of December 1992 and
January 1993, he seemed destined not only for a long stint as <w>
Maharashtra's </w> strong man but also to play an increasingly prominent role
in Congress and national politics.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#49:2>
Mr <w> Khairnar's </w> accusations, however, have checked that onward
march and, for the present, Mr Pawar is obviously very much on the defensive.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#50:2>
Even if his opponents within the party restrain themselves for the
time being, the others will not.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#51:2>
Nor will Mr Khairnar who seems to have become nearly as popular as Mr
T.N. Seshan because of his campaign against corruption. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#52:2>
But two things are relevant in this context.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#53:2>
First, just as not many people will be convinced by Mr <w> Pawar's
</w> breezy dismissal of the charges made by Mr Khairnar as <quote> "
frivolous and baseless," </quote> a time will also come when Mr Khairnar will
have to be a lot more specific about his allegations.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#54:2>
Since he is reluctant to go to court, it is not clear who will judge
the authenticity of his charges, if at all he provides documentary evidence.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#55:2>
Perhpas the departmental proceedings relating to his suspension will
enable him to substantiate what he has been saying, but it is clear that
sooner or later he will have to turn from rhetoric to something more
con-crete.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#56:2>
Secondly, the political fallout from the controversy will also have
to be assessed by both the Congress and its enemies.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#57:2>
When Mr V.N. Gadgil referred to the politically unwise decisiion to
suspend Mr Khairnar, he was evidently thinking in terms of what was
detrimental to the interests of the party rather than the chief minister.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#58:2>
But the Congress will now have to consider to what extent any
weakening of Mr <w> Pawar's </w> position will harm the party.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#59:2>
Maharashtra is one of the crucial states so far as the Congress is
concerned and it cannot allow a situation where it will approach the next
elections in a mood of uncertainty.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#60:2>
Mr Pawar will have to use his current reprieve to bolster his
position if he wants to remain in the big league.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#61:2>
But his success - - or its opposite - - will depend as much on his
own efforts as those of Mr Khairnar. </p> <*> a dark line in the middle </*>

<h> <bold> Action On Patents </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#63:2>
The Union <w> government's </w> decision to amend the Indian
Patents Act, 1970, was only to be expected.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#64:2>
The government can at best delay doing this till the winter session
of Parliament.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#65:2>
Any such postponement will be purely a political decision since the
earlier the amendments are pushed through, the better it will be for India.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#66:2>
Opposition parties are bound to exploit the <w> government's </w>
discomfiture as the <w> BJP's </w> decision to oppose the amendment shows.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#67:2>
The major Left parties have already declared their opposition.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#68:2>
The <w> government's </w> problems are due to the fact that it had
taken a tough stand until now on the subject of product patenting.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#69:2>
The Indian view has been that process patenting will be legally
protected but not product patenting.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#70:2>
This position was based on the understanding that if Indian
innovators discovered new ways of producing a patented product, they should
be allowed to do so.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#71:2>
Indeed, in much of east Asia early industrialisation was based on
such <quote> " reverse engineering" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#72:2>
Reverse engineering has, however, been less successful in India than
in east Asia in the manufacture of world class products.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#73:2>
More often than not, Indian producers have produced only cheap
imitations for the domestic market.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#74:2>
Manufacturers in developed countries have protested against such
imitations which is why the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations sought to
offer patent protection for products as well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-008#75:2>
While there is much merit in the original Indian position
opposing product patenting, the fact is that India will have to fall in
line with the rest of the world since an overwhelming majority of GATT
member-nations have gone along with the developed <w> countries' </w> in this
matter.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#76:2>
Indeed, there has been some re-thinking even in India on the subject
and some of the critics of product patenting, like the domestic drugs and
pharmaceuticals firms, have argued in favour of clearer patenting laws.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#77:2>
The key issue, however, is the efficiency of the patenting system and
of the Patents Office.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#78:2>
A recent report in this paper about a professor at an Indian
Institute of Management, who is aiding the codification of Indian systems of
medicine, approaching the U.S.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#79:2>
Patents Office for patenting local medical systems on the grounds
that the Indian Patents Office <quote> " leaks" </quote> and is <quote> "
corrupt" </quote> is a shameful testimony to the sorry state of affairs in a
vital area.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#80:2>
Along with amending the patent law, the government must ensure that
the institutional mechanism for patent protection is efficient and reliable
and does not adversely affect the interests of Indians approaching it for
protection of their intellectual property rights.

<ICE-IND:W2E-008#81:2>
Unless the government can convince the people that what it is doing
is in the national interest and not a response to external pressure, public
mistrust will continue to be exploited by the opposition parties. </p> <*> a
