<ICE-IND:W2C-004#4:1>
<@PR> BHUBANESWAR {#}, <@DR> Jan. 5 {#} :
The Orissa Government has been directed by the Election Commission to
prosecute former Congress(I) Minister, Mr. Muzzaffar Hussain Khan, found
<foreign> prima facie </foreign> guilty of opening fire while attempting to
capture a booth at Durgapalli in Bolangir on the <indig> Lok Sabha
</indig> poll-day in November last. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#5:1>
In a confidential letter ( dated January 2), sent to the Chief
Secretary, Ramakanta Mishra, the Election Commission has further
instructed that action be immediately initiated against Ramesh Behera and
Sanjeev Marik, the then collector and S.P. respectively of Bolangir district,
for <quote> " breach and <}> <-> deriliction </-> <+> dereliction </+> </}>
of official duty." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#6:1>
On the poll-day violence at Durgapalli, Khan, till then a
minister in J. B. <w> Patnaik's </w> erstwhile Government, has stormed into
the polling booth along with his gunmen and supporters.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#7:1>
In the violence that followed, two persons were killed and several
injured.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#8:1>
Several of those grievously injured had bullet injuries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#9:1>
The directive of the Election Commission reached the chief <w>
secretary's </w> office on Friday.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#10:1>
The Commission has concurred with preliminary reports of the DIG (
Sambalpur Range), which squarely indicted Khan for violence.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#11:1>
The chief secretary has been instructed to prosecute Khan, dropped
from the new Hemananda Biswal Ministry, immediately under Section 123(5),
131, 132 and 133 of the Representation of <w> Peoples' </w> Act, 1951. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#12:1>
The Election Commission has been explicit in indicting the then
district collector and superintendent of police for their <quote> " dubious"
</quote> roles.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#13:1>
Enquiry reports of the DIG, as also that by the special election <}>
<-> observor </-> <+> observer </+> </}> , Mr. Sanjeev Hota, had been
extremely critical of the <quote> ` conduct' </quote> of the two top
district officials. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#14:1>
It has been time and again alleged that Ramesh Behera and Sanjeev
Marik had been working overtime as extensions of the Congress(I) during the
elections.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#15:1>
The S.P. in particular had been at the receiving end of flak for the
manner he chased away, brandishing a revolver, the victory procession of the
elected <indig> Janata Dal </indig> M.P., Balgopal Mishra.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#16:1>
The victorious M.P. had to run for his life and hide himself in a
house as the S.P. threateningly searched around.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#17:1>
While an inquiry by the revenue divisional commissioner has been
ordered into the <indig> lathi- </indig> charge of the victory procession, a
privilege notice against the S.P. has been tabled in the <indig> Lok Sabha
</indig> by three newly-elected <indig> Janata Dal </indig> M.Ps. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#18:1>
The Election Commission directive to prosecute the former
minister has put the State Government in a tight spot.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#19:1>
Though the enquiry reports of the DIG and the special election <}>
<-> observor </-> <+> observer </+> </}> had found the former minister
guilty, the Government so long had been going slow in proceeding against
Khan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#20:1>
Over a month having lapsed since the poll-day violence, Khan has
yet not been arrested.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#21:1>
This, despite the Orissa High Court having turned down his
anticipatory bail plea almost a month ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#22:1>
The dithering of the Orissa Government in proceeding against
Khan was more pronounced, given the strong observations by the High Court in
rejecting his bail plea.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#23:1>
The court had observed that <quote> " it was obvious that <w> Khan's
</w> unauthorised presence inside the polling booth with his gunmen had
triggered off the violence." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#24:1>
The court further ruled that grant of anticipatory bail would shake
the faith and confidence of the people in the administration of justice.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#25:1>
It was also observed that the former <w> minister's </w> apprehension
that he would be arrested was not good enough a cause to grant him bail.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#26:1>
<quote> " Even a murderer in broad daylight might have apprehension
that he would be arrested but that did not mean that would he be given
anticipatory bail," </quote> the court ruled. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#27:1>
The ruling was delivered to a packed court-room on December 6,
but the Government refused to budge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#28:1>
The directive having come however from the Election
Commission, it is certain that Khan is neck-deep in trouble, no matter how
sincerely the Government may try to bail him out.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#29:1>
Irrespective of the outcome of prosecutions that the Government
would now be forced to initiate against him, Khan is sure to be denied a
party ticket this time at the Assembly elections, given the strictures
passed against him. </p> </I>

<h> Thane gangs join Dawood rivals </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#31:2>
<bold> By <@AS> Prabhat Sharan {#} </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#32:2>
<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> Jan. 7 {#} : Two notorious gangs from Thane area have joined the alliance formed by
Dawood <w> Ibrahim's </w> rivals, to challenge the Dubai-based <w> don's
</w> supremacy, in the city underworld. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#33:2>
The recent raid on notorious gangster Arun <w> Gawli's </w>
bastion at Dagdi <indig> chawl </indig> has not deterred the Thane gangsters
Ganesh Naik alias Ganya and Ashok Bhangi, from teaming up with the alliance
comprising Gawli, Amar Nai, Kiran Walavalkar, Phillips Pandhre, Saundya
and Anna Shetty ( of Ulhasnagar), Yeda Bala, Haywards and Ashwin.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#34:2>
Walavalkar was recently nabbed by the CID officials during the raid
at Dagdi <indig> chawl </indig> along with four others. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#35:2>
Underworld sources disclosed that in December last, Gopal Rajwani
of Ulhasnagar, following the death of a notorious smuggler, Lallubhai,
brought about unifications amongst these splintered mobs.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#36:2>
The reason was simple: Lallubhai was the main <}> <-> financer <->
<+> financier </+> </}> for Rajwani and Amar Naik.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#37:2>
Soon after the murder of Lallubhai in Sun-N-Sands Hotel, Ramesh
Bhogle the main planner of Amar <w> Naik's </w> activities, was shot at Sun
Mills compound, by Chotta <w> Rajan's </w> men.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#38:2>
Naik realised that his position in Central Bombay was being
threatened and that his groups alone could not pose any challenge to <w>
Dawood's </w> gang which is funded by land <w> shark's </w> , smuggling <}>
<-> financers </-> <+> financiers </+> </}> and contraband distributors like
Sharad Shetty and Bhai Thakur, who have a monopoly over the landings of the
smuggled items, on the Vasai coast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#39:2>
At the same time, <w> Naik's </w> group and other anti-Dawood
gangs also realised their limitations from the point of police contacts,
which <w> Dawood's </w> gang <}> <-> weild </-> <+> wield </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#40:2>
It was because of this that an amalgamation took place. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#41:2>
The alliance soon after the formation, bumped off three of <w>
Dawood's </w> men.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#42:2>
Though these killings did not make any dent in the monolithic
structure of <w> Dawood's </w> smuggling, <indig> havala </indig> and
extortion empire, it certainly shook the builders, hoteliers and bookies
lobbies, which regularly pay protection money to the gangs which rule the
underworld. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#43:2>
The police, realising that there might be a spree of gangland
killings in the city, swooped on <w> Gawli's </w> mob and picked up
Walavalkar and some others.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#44:2>
However, despite the police raid, Ganya and Bhangi went ahead and
teamed up with the alliance.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#45:2>
<w> Ganga's </w> gang recently saw a split, as his one time right
hand, Ashok Chuadhari, has formed his own gang.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#46:2>
Sources said that both these gangs are the deadliest groups that
operate in the area and their power comes more from the clout which they have
in the police. </p>

<h> Thane gangs join Dawood rivals </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#49:2>
<bold> Continued from page 1 </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#50:2>
Police sources disclosed that gang clashes are likely to take
place in Dongri, Ulhasnagar, Dadar-Parel, and Chembur areas.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#51:2>
The reason being that most of <w> Dawood's </w> henchmen are out
on bail and those who are wanted also move in the city with a puffed up
chests.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#52:2>
Recently, Anil Parab, the gangster who had used the machine gun
during the killing of Asok Joshi and his goons, near Panvel, got married
in the central part of Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#53:2>
Though most of the gangsters who had taken part in the Panvel
shoot-out had surrendered ( later released on bail), Parab had not. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#54:2>
The only hitch in Chotta <w> Rajan's </w> gang is that one of
their main planners, Sadhu Shetty is still behind bars.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#55:2>
Sadhu Shetty was recently shifted from Nashik Jail to Nagpur Jail,
following a clash with Prakash Misal, a gangster from Worli, who is serving a
life sentence in Nashik Jail.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#56:2>
Misal was assaulted by Sadhu <w> Shetty's </w> goon - - Chimay.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#57:2>
Chotta <w> Rajan's </w> group, because of the absence of Sadhu
Shetty, who used to deal with the disciplinary forces in the eastern suburbs,
recently shifted their headquarters from Ghatla village to Tilak Nagar, as
that area provides them more security, since the police there is not hostile
towards them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#58:2>
Both the groups have already started arming <}> <-> theselves </->
<+> themselves </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#59:2>
While, <w> Dawood's </w> men whether from Dongri, Dadar-Parel,
Jogeshwari or Chembur, have a stock of arms along with the support of
disciplinary forces, the other side, recently procured two sten guns and
four revolvers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#60:2>
The stakes are control over land in the western suburbs,
narcotics, gold and silver contraband, extortion and <indig> havala </indig>
syndicate.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#61:2>
Finally, the gang which comes out winner on the underworld
chessboard, will also get political patronage. </p> </I>

<@PR> CALCUTTA {#}, <@DR> Jan. 12 {#}.

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#66:3>
SLIP up even a little and you will pay the price in any close
encounter.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#67:3>
This <{> <-> Olimpia</-> <+> olympia </+> </{> of Paraguay, drove
home to the discomfiture of Lyngby Boldklubben, of <}> <-> Denkarm </-> <+>
Denmark </+> </}> , in the group <quote> ` A' </quote> match of the
Jawaharlal Nehru Centenary Cup football tournament at the Salt Lake Stadium,
here, this evening. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#68:3>
A poor, incomprehensible pass back by left stopper Hasse Kuhn to
the top of the box opened the gate for <}> <-> Olimpa's </-> <+> <w>
Olympia's </w> </+> </}> victory.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#69:3>
Goalkeeper Kim Brodersen, who had a very fine match, rushed out and
clashed with right stopper Michael Gothenborg backing into him.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#70:3>
The ball dropped off them loose for nippy Gabriel Gonzalez to seize
and drive home for the opening goal in the 21st minute. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#71:3>
Five minutes from the end, <{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> olympia
</+> </{> substitute Carlos Torres and two colleagues hustled substitute
right back Dennis Hansen near the touchline and halfway line and the ball
was pushed forward for Luis Monzon to break away for the top of the Lyngby
penalty area.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#72:3>
Brodersen swiftly came out, but was beaten by a neat dribble of
Monzon, who veered to his right and drove into the empty net for the second
goal. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#73:3>
<h> IN SEMI-FINALE </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#74:3>
This 2-0 victory virtually puts <{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> olympia
</+> </{> into the semi-finals, as although the other three teams, Lyngby,
East Bengal and Salgaocar all can hypothetically tally four points, all three
are unlikely to.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#75:3>
<{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> olympia </+> </{> meet East Bengal on
Sunday, the same day Lyngby also play Salgaocar.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#76:3>
Those ties will make clearer the picture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#77:3>
Lyngby saw a little more of the ball.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#78:3>
But <}> <-> is </-> <+> it </+> </}> also increasingly became clear
that they were not creating as many openings as <{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+>
olympia </+> </{> though the Paraguayan champions had possession for
shorter spells.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#79:3>
And Olimpia were more menacing whenever their attack moved. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#80:3>
Skipper and central midfielder John Helt is a gifted player.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#81:3>
His stroking of the ball with various parts of his feet, <}> <->
especailly </-> <+> especially </+> </}> the right, to relay the ball with
firm and direct or curling passes saw the Danes come through from the flanks
and occasionally through the middle.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#82:3>
He had fine support from left winger Henrik Lersen and Dennis Foss.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#83:3>
But as a team the Danes did not have the precision or skills to get
the better of the Libertadores Cup losing <w> finalists' </w> defence.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#84:3>
Their crosses from the flanks, usually long and intended for
colleagues bearing in from the opposite flank into the box, were
uncompromisingly headed away.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#85:3>
Left back Silvio Suarez caught the eye with his fine heading to clear
the threats away. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#86:3>
Lyngby also lacked the finesse to break through on wall passes,
their efforts to use this simple move came to nought through the final pass
being just a wee bit awry in weighting of it.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#87:3>
The receiver found the ball just out of his reach.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#88:3>
Flemming Christen and Claus Christiansen were guilty of the slight
inaccuracy of the passes that could have put Peter Nielsen and Klaus Berggren
on the path to an equaliser before the interval. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#89:3>
<{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> Olympia </+> </{> were very
professional.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#90:3>
Their marking was more zonal, but very clever in that they baited the
Danes to pass and then darted in to swoop up the ball and set in motion
counter-attacks.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#91:3>
They were very confident in defence and the long lease their
rivals had on the ball did not perturb them.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#92:3>
In attack they were quick and darted away from rivals drawn out of
position.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#93:3>
If they did not add to their tally till five minutes from the end it
was due to the fine goalkeeping of Brodersen, who timed his sorties well and
covered the angles and blocked shots at the top of the box. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#94:3>
After the second goal he denied Adolfo Jara a goal that would
have been somewhat similar to that of Monzon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#95:3>
Robson Reta Moso, the <{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> Olympia </+> </{>
midfielder, was shown the yellow card by referee Sagar Sen for tripping Foss
late in the first half. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#96:3>
<{> <-> Olimpia </-> <+> Olympia </+> </{> today played with
numbers stitched in a square over the black bank on their shorts.

<ICE-IND:W2C-004#97:3>
That made it easier for the spectators to identify them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-004#98:3>
Tomorrow, Zambia will play Metallist Kharkov in what will be the
last match for the two in group <quote> ` B' </quote> . </p> </I>
