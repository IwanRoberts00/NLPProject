A very very <,> feeble <,> push on to the right of the goal
keeper <,> Teja Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#77:1:B>
And Teja Singh was confused soul to <,,> judge as to where the ball
was going <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#78:1:B>
And this goal coming in the seventeenth minutes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#79:1:B>

handle the ball success from there but <,,> type <,,> Gundeep to the goal
<,,> giving it back to Ripudaman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#99:1:X>
Nice leading <,> intercepted ball <,> very good save <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#100:1:X>
Air India back on to the attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#101:1:X>
Darryl <w> D'Souza </w> <,> Darryl <w> D'Souza </w> <,> Darryl <w>
D'Souza </w> <,> play on to the right flank <,,> quite into <,,> twice into

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#104:1:B>
Right <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#105:1:B>
Changes <,> Air india <,,> right side <,,> forward pass <,,> the
ball went too fast <,,> going over the <,,> backline <,,>

Punjab Sindh bank <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#107:1:B>
Good scoop intercepted but <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#108:1:X>
Down comes <,> Gundeep gives it to Ramsharan <,> Ramsharan
down to left flank <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#109:1:B>
But fails to beat <,,> Surinder <,,> who loses control <,> a
free hit to <,,> Air India <,> free hit going over the sideline <,,> on the
hit in <,,> for Punjab Sindh bank <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#110:1:X>
Nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through <,> Air India
<,,> leading by a goal <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#111:1:X>
Score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by Aranha <,> and
for the continuation of commentary in Hindi <,> it is Abhay Chaturvedi <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#112:1:A>
<&> In India </&>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#113:1:B>
Abhay I would just like to say one thing <,> five of the <?>
interrupt land </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#114:1:B>
For the Air India team <,,> now Darryl <w> D'Souza </w> and <,>
Edgar Mascarenhas <,,> they are infact trained as defendant <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#115:1:B>
But these are the two players who besides being <,> playing as
defendants they are always leading the attack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#116:1:B>
And they are always keeping them forward on the move <,,> whereas
<,,> there in the Punjab Sindh bank team <,,> the size of these <O> a few
words </O> is very long <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#117:1:B>
Ah Ramsharan Gundeep <,> Ripudaman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#118:1:B>
They have not been able to combine well <,,> whereas the Air India
forward <,> <w> they're </w> just lurking near the <,> goal mark <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#119:1:B>
They just get hardly chance <,> at the <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#120:1:B>
They would have been thrown up but for Aranha <,> that you cast in
last line <,,> who catches the one with <?> one day </?> <,> and centrally
<O> one word </O> feeling <,> I don't know whether you agree with me or not
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#121:1:B>
Punjab Sindh bank having <,> nearly <,> five internationals is
kill their act

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#122:1:B>
But I think over confident must have started with that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#123:1:B>
And this is what you are paying for your over confidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#124:1:B>
And so far they have not been able to combine well and all the
players played so far <,> ah practically <,,> you <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#125:1:B>
Before we leave on <,> to catch the relay <,> <O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#126:1:B>
I was considering they got just four chances <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#127:1:B>
And out of the four chances <,> they converted three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#128:1:B>
Fourth one was Edward Aranha <,> a ball going just by yard <,>
otherwise the goal keeper was awake <,> there was no one to <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#129:1:B>
To me it appears the Punjab Sind bank defence <,,> does not know
what <,> it was to be <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#130:1:B>
They are running everywhere <,,> but not marking defence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#131:1:B>
Who lies the whole side <,> Aranha <,,> here follows <,,> Rajesh
Chouhan <,,> and Darryl <w> D'Souza </w> Alex <w> D'Souza </w> all coming
into the attack <,> nobody is marking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#132:1:B>
They come into the attack and immediately don't go back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#133:1:B>
That only shows their partners their thinking <,,> which <,> the
Punjab Sindh bank boys <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#134:1:B>
The <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#135:1:B>
And they are more uh <,,> selfish <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#136:1:B>
If Ramsharan gets the ball <,> he goes down the left flank <,,> he
doesn't look for a opening they are along with him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#137:1:B>
Same is the case with <,> uh <,,> uh Gundeep <,,> they have got a
very good chance <,> and Gundeep has given a back pass to <,,> Ramsharan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#138:1:B>
A swing way down the <,,> near the right back line <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#139:1:B>
And from here specially <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#140:1:B>
Once they go after the back line <,> they are tied because they
can't do it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#141:1:B>
Now here is the Punjab players <,> back <,,> on the <?> crease
</?> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#142:1:B>
The leading team has to prove <O> a few words </O> <,> playing
final of the <,,> third Lala Bhim Sain memorial invitation hockey tournament
<,,> at Shivaji stadium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#143:1:B>
Venue of many international tournament <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#144:1:B>
The Punjab Sindh bank <,> boys <,,> just relaxing <,,> but <,,> no
strategy is being formed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#145:1:B>
Again on your <,> same replaying <,,> Delhi policeman <,,> <&> In
Hindi </&>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#146:1:X>
Punjab Sindh bank going <,,> into the field <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#147:1:X>
Now the second half will start <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#148:1:B>
Abhay <,> the three goal lead <,,> in the final <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#149:1:X>
<w> It's </w> a very great moral boosting <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#150:1:B>
In fact Punjab Sindh bank <,,> was expected to do <,> very
well <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#151:1:X>
Played very well <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#152:1:B>
For them it is demoralising <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#153:1:B>
In second half <w> we'll </w> have to see whether they would be
able to <,,> recapture their form <,,> and fight back <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#154:1:X>
Yes <,> they have thirty-five minutes or so <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#155:1:B>
Because <,> one can't imagine <,,> that the Punjab Sindh bank
won't come back into the game <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#156:1:B>
They have the capacity <,,> they have the capability <,,> but the
only thing is <,,> they will have to stretch during individual approach <,,>
and <,,> combined <,,> and move ahead <,,> with a combined move <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#157:1:X>
Here are they Air India team on the screen <,> and number
eight <,,>

<,> suppose <,,> the former Lieutenant Governor of Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#161:1:X>
The Punjab Sindh bank team being introduced to him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#162:1:X>
This is Narender <,,> former international umpire <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#163:1:X>
Sorry <,> here is Bullard the international umpire <,,> Kukoo
Walia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#164:1:X>
And now <,> the Air India team <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#165:1:B>
Edgar Mascarenhas <,,> now introducing his boys to <,> the
former Lieutenant Governor <,,> H K L Kapoor <,,> to his team mates from Air
India <,,>

<$X> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#166:1:X>
The four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-015#167:1:B>
All there is over <,,> the two teams <,> take their
respective places <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#168:1:B>
Punjab Sindh bank will attack from right to left <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#169:1:B>
Now already down by three goals <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#170:1:B>
They will have to work very hard <,,> to get back into the game
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#171:1:B>
And the morals of the Air India boys <,,> is very high <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#172:1:B>
And one thing very notable that the Air India defences <,> they
are marking their players <,> very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#173:1:B>
They are not letting the rafter Gundeep and uh <,,> Ripudaman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#174:1:B>
Ball on to the side <,,> and they know <,,> the passing would be
given to one of them <,,> and they are marking it very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#175:1:B>
All the attempt of <,,> Punjab Sindh bank <,,> to pass on the ball
<,,> to either Ramsharan Gundeep or Ripudaman <,,> are being frustrated by
the <,,> passmanship of the <,,> well marked <,> passing by the defenders
<,,> of Air India <,,>

goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes <,,> the third goal coming of
that stick of Rajesh Chauhan <,> in the thirty-third <,,> the first half
itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#178:1:B>

Clive <w> D'Souza </w> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-015#179:1:B>
