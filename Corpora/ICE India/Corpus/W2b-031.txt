<bold>A</bold>bility to retrieve enormous amounts of information,
shoot down hostile missiles and aircraft, propel satellites and spaceships,
cut and heat-treat materials, or kill cancerous cells in the human body with
pinpoint accuracy, is the magic of laser technology that was once regarded as
<quote> " an invention in search of an application" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#4:1>
It has now become an indispensable tool for science, technology,
medicine and defence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#5:1>
In 1916, Albert Einstein predicted that electrons could be made to
emit a special kind of light, but it was not until 1960 that Theodore Maiman,
an engineer at Hughes Research Laboratories in the United States, made this
vision come true.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#6:1>
A flash tube was used to pump energy into a ruby rod to make it emit a
brilliant beam of red light of a kind never seen before. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#7:1>
A conventional light bulb emits light consisting of a number of
different wavelengths, which stream out randomly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#8:1>
In scientific terms it is incoherent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#9:1>
A laser emits coherent light of one wavelength, with the light waves
surging out in a tightly ordered array.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#10:1>
Laser light can pack immense power and can travel long distances.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#11:1>
The term <quote> " laser" </quote> is an acronym for light
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#12:1>
The <w> laser's </w> first practical impact was in the realm of
experimental scientific investigation, where it provided researchers a source
of light that could not only identify types of atoms and molecules and
initiate chemical reactions but, in general, probe, measure, and modify the
fundamental properties of matter.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#13:1>
Thereafter, the <w> laser's </w> remarkable properties were put to
use in industrial applications.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#14:1>
The first, and in some sense still the largest, application is
cutting and heat-treating of materials whether the need is for large cuts
in armour plate, using an extremely powerful carbon dioxide laser, or the
precise trim of an expensive piece of synthetic fibre cloth using a small,
hand-held laser.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#15:1>
The cuts are made without damaging any nearby material. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#16:1>
What is that makes laser light so exceptional?

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#17:1>
Although most people believe that laser light is more powerful than
light from other sources, this is decidedly not the case.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#18:1>
With the exception of very specialised industrial or military lasers,
the total light output power of virtually any laser is less than one-fifth
that of a 60-watt bulb, and the lasers used in communication, computers, and
the recording industry all emit less light energy than a small ornamental
bulb. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#19:1>
If it is not total power of emission, what special properties of
laser light make it different from the light emitted from incandescent or
fluorescent lights, <w> welders' </w> arcs, the sun, or even from fire?

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#20:1>
There are a dozen or so highly technical differences, but most
commercial and industrial applications rely on the four fundamentally unique
properties of laser light: colour purity ( monochromaticity ) ,
directionality, tightness of focus, and coherence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#21:1>
<h> <it> Colour purity : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#22:1>
White light, for example light from the sun, is really a mixture of
light of different colours, each with a different wavelength.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#23:1>
In the portion of the light spectrum that we can see, the shortest
wave-lengths appear blue; somewhat longer wavelengths appear green; and
those longer still yield yellow, orange, red, and deep red.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#24:1>
Sir Issac Newton demonstrated over 300 years ago that white light is
easily broken up into its constituents by passing it through some device that
bends the light proportional to its wavelength.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#25:1>
Mother Nature provides such a device in raindrops; sunlight passing
through the drops is refracted into colours, yielding spectacular rainbows.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#26:1>
Similarly, when light <O> <&> page </&> 36 </O> from a flashlight or
light bulb passes through a prism, it will split into colours, even if a
piece of red glass is placed over the light source. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#27:1>
In contrast, light from a laser operating in the red spectrum
would pass through the prism without being split.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#28:1>
This is because the range of red colours in the laser is extremely
narrow; the output is highly colour pure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#29:1>
So even though the total light energy from the flashlight may be
larger than from the laser, all of the <w> laser's </w> light power goes into
one extremely pure colour, while the power from the other sources is spread
over a vast number of colours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#30:1>
Many industrial and research laser applications depend on colour
purity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#31:1>
<h> <it> Directionality : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#32:1>
When light is emitted from a light bulb, it has no preferred
direction; the radiation goes uniformly in all directions unless something
special is done to capture and steer it along a specific path.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#33:1>
Steering devices such as mirrors and lenses are common and form an
integral part of many of our everyday light sources.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#34:1>
However, if the application calls for a beam of light going in one
precise direction, with little or no spread in angle, something quite
different is required. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#35:1>
<h> <it> Tightness of focus : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#36:1>
When focused down to a small spot by a lens, <w> light's </w> spread
increases.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#37:1>
Since laser light possesses the smallest product of angular spread
and spot size of all light ( diffraction limited), it will have the least
possible angular spread when focused to a tiny spot.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#38:1>
This property provides the laser with very precise focusing, allowing
all of the laser power to be concentrated on only one spot on the material.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#39:1>
In general, light from visible lasers can be routinely focused to
spot sizes on the order of .000127 centimetre, far smaller than light from
any other source. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#40:1>
<h> <it> Coherence : </it> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#41:1>
Light, regardless of its wavelength or colour, can be usefully
imagined as a wave travelling through space, or any transparent medium like
air or glass.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#42:1>
This wave has crests and valleys, much like ocean waves; two such
waves are said to be correlated if their respective crests and valleys bear
some relationship to each other, either in space of time. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#43:1>
When a light source produces radiation that is not correlated in
space or time, it is said to be <quote> " incoherent" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#44:1>
The best example of an incoherent radiator is the sun.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#45:1>
This is because the light coming from the sun at one instant is
uncorrelated with the light emitted later, and the light at the top of the
sun is uncorrelated with the light from the bottom of the sun.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#46:1>
In fact, unless great pains are taken, light from virtually all
non-laser sources is nearly totally incoherent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#47:1>
Laser light, however, can be easily made coherent in space and
time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#48:1>
This property allows lasers to operate in a special mode in which the
output is no longer a steady beam of light, but rather a precise string of
extremely short-duration pulses. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#49:1>
Lasers have revolutionised communications, computers, and
entertainment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#50:1>
The development of solid-state lasers capable of emitting light with
long wavelengths far into the red end of the spectrum ( so-called infrared )
has prompted parallel engineering efforts on glass fibre cables for
transmitting this light. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#51:1>
The benefits of <w> laser's </w> ability to retrieve enormous
amounts of information stored in a tiny silver platter called CD-ROM (
Compact Disk - - Read Only Memory ) are many.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#52:1>
What is more, the laser has the ability to record, with amazing speed
and flawless accuracy, vast amounts of information onto discs within
computers, or onto paper.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#53:1>
Magazines and newspapers are now printed from computers using laser
printers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#54:1>
Laser printers use plain paper, eliminating expensive photographic
paper, processing machines, chemicals, maintenance and labour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#55:1>
They cost less than other technologies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#56:1>
As important as they are, these applications pale in significance
when compared to <w> laser's </w> potential medical uses.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#57:1>
Lasers were first used in eye surgery, the <w> eye's </w>
transparency making it a logical first subject.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#58:1>
Even now, most innovations in the use of lasers occur in
opthalmology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#59:1>
The blue light from an argon light is being used to seal a hole in
the retina, to treat glaucoma - - potentially a blinding condition - - by
cutting a hole to let excess fluid escape and to preserve sight in persons
with diabetic retinopathy by destroying the abnormal blood vessels caused by
the disease. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#60:1>
The eye laser developed in the US was first used in India where
millions of people suffer from cataract.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#61:1>
The instrument detects whether a <w> patient's </w> retina is
obstructed by a cataract or is no longer functioning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#62:1>
Lasers also see through cataracts to a determine whether surgery can
restore a <w> patient's </w> eyesight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#63:1>
Lasers are also being used successfully to remove kidney stones
from the lower ureter, the tube leading from the kidney to the bladder.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#64:1>
Traditionally, this operation involves a large incision in the <w>
patient's </w> side and hospitalisation of upto two weeks.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#65:1>
Now with the use of a laser the stones are literally chipped to
pieces and patients are benefiting from shorter hospital stays. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#66:1>
Similarly, gallstones are exposed to lasers through an optical
fibre passed through one channel of rigid endoscope.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#67:1>
A second channel contains a relay lens system for viewing and a third
channel transports a saline <O> <&> page </&> 37 </O> <O> continued on page

solution purge that crushes the stones in the gall-bladder. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#69:1>
The high-energy beam of light can be used for cutting, sealing
and closing blood vessels.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#70:1>
Lasers can be used to replace stitches in many kinds of surgery.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#71:1>
The beams can fuse the protein of the tissues and, when the wound
heals, the body can absorb the coagulated tissue replacing a new protein and
preventing scars on the body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#72:1>
Laser techniques can work much faster than tranditional suturing,
thereby reducing the risk of infection while healing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#73:1>
It achieves its cutting power by focusing light.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#74:1>
A beam of only a new watts can be made to cut an enormous amount by
focusing on a spot smaller than the diameter of a human hair. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#75:1>
Laser technology has not only made surgery a gentler process, it
also costs less and saves time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#76:1>
It has succeeded in its goal of cutting down hospitalisation and has,
in fact, entirely taken some procedures out of the hospital.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#77:1>
Laser technology lessens the trauma of traditional surgery and is
good because it is gentle, precise and can work into a deep hole without
having to disrupt a lot of overlying tissues.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#78:1>
Unlike in conventional surgery, the surgeon can sight along the beam
of light at the target tissue and does not have to struggle to look around
for the instrument. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-031#79:1>
The laser has also demonstrated itself as an awesomely potent
weapon of destruction recently during the Gulf War.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#80:1>
Missiles were tracked, identified and ultimately destroyed with the
coherence of laser light.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#81:1>
It is the source of a vast number of new technologies as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-031#82:1>
This technology has been thoroughly integrated into everyday life and
it has developed into a tool so ubiquitous it would be hard to imagine life
in the high-tech world without it. </p> <*> filled square </*> </I>
