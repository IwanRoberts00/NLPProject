<ICE-IND:S1B-053#2:1:A>
The past <,> much sounded programme of bringing <,,> uh
bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#3:1:A>
This budget does not hold on <{> <[> to the hope </[> <,> for
backward state <,> like Assam <,> for bringing the region at par <,> with the
rest of the country

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#4:1:B>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#5:1:B>
Yeah every region <{> <[> should be considered </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#6:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{> industry <,>
communication

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#7:1:B>
Before three we should finish <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#8:1:A>
Assam and Bodo <O> one or two words </O> land <,> the entire
north eastern region <,> is full of untapped <,> natural resources <,> and
mineral <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#9:1:A>
There are no provisions in the <{1> <[1> budget <,> to combat the
waste <,> to find out </[1> <,> for the purpose of finding out <,> <{2> <[2>
and tapping the natural resources <,> for the <}> <-> beneficial </-> <+>
benefit </+> </}> of the people </[2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#10:1:B>
<[1> As to <O> a few words </O> </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#11:1:B>
<[2> No no finance <O> a few words </O> </[2> </{2> your party
time is sixty-two minutes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#12:1:A>
And bringing material welfare to them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#13:1:A>
Assam is a state <,> where eighty percent of the people live on
agriculture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#14:1:A>
<{> <[> Assam perhaps was the first state <,> where ceiling on land
holding act was passed <,> in the mid fifties </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#15:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#16:1:A>
The maximum amount of land <,> which an agriculturist can hold
<,> is fifty <indig> bighas </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#17:1:A>
In the presence of decay <,> and natural division of family <,> the
areas in possession of <,> farmers <,> are diminishing <,> making the land
with farmers <,> progressively <,> uneconomic <,> making more and more
farmers marginal <,> and landless <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#18:1:A>
General provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture <,>
will not help <,,> uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special
provisions <,,> uh for making industrial planning <,> has to be made

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#19:1:A>
Special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team <O>
one or two words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#20:1:A>
There are no provisions <,> of mechanical agriculture <,> no
provisions for irrigation <,> and other <O> two word </O> to make agriculture
<O> one word </O> <,> economically viable <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#21:1:A>
In the field of industry <,,> my state <,,> is the most backward
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#22:1:A>
The industries in the state <,> has not taste its <,> exploitative
character <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#23:1:A>
The British <,> uh colonial <,,> exploited the natural resources in
the state to their best <,> and the Indian which is that has taken over <,>
only <,> saves exploitative <,> assault <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#24:1:A>
Local <,> enterpreneur <,> are being discouraged <,> in their
attempt <,> to enter the field <,> and there are <,> <O> one or two words
</O> incentives to them not to <,> try healthy <O> one or two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#25:1:A>
Industrialists operating in Assam exploit the natural wealth <,>
resources <,,> all profit <,> take this out of the state <,> without
contributing to the welfare of the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#26:1:A>
The Industries also do not help <,> in the solution <,> of the
unemployment programme <,> as they are reluctant <,> to employ local people
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#27:1:A>
They <O> one or two words </O> <,,> for industries in the north
eastern region <,> would not <,> confirm anybody with <,> to the people of
the state <,> and the region

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#28:1:A>
<O> One or two words </O> provisions are made <,> to encourage <,>
local entrepreneur <,> as part of industries by offering special concession
and in <O> one or two words </O> <,> for encouraging them <,> to enter the
field <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#29:1:A>
There are <,> no provisions in the budget <,> for rehabilitation of
the non-employed <,> and <O> one or two words </O> <,> by starting <,>
agro-based <,,> heavy industry <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#30:1:A>
They are <,> uh no provisions <,> for meeting to the <,,>
progressive unemployment <,> programme <,> and number of announcement being
in medium <,> and <,,> it is uh <,> increasing <,> by last every year

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#31:1:A>
The problem <,,> is a real one and a serious one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#32:1:A>
The use of the state <,> discoverings on <,,> are straight away
emerging out of <,> uh deep sense of deprivation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#33:1:A>
Large numbers of youth <,> have taken up arms <,> others have taken
recourse to <,> extortion <O> one word </O> as national <O> a few words </O>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#34:1:A>
We are going to lose an entire generation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#35:1:A>
Militancy <,> and <,,> militarian para military forces <,> have
been <,> a permanent picture in the state <,> and large numbers of people are
behind the bars under TADA <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#36:1:A>
Development was <,,> uh kept to a standstill <,> for years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#37:1:A>
The Government has <,,> to realise <,,> that strong arm tactics is
not going to help <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#38:1:A>
There should be <,,> special provision <,> for removal of <,> the
terrorist <,> and the development of the state and special measure <,> to
ensure economic development <,> should be started <,,> </I>


<I> <O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#39:2:A>
B) V M Jadhav </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-053#40:2:B>
You know and everybody knows <,,> that in June nineteen
ninety-one <,> when our government has come into power <,> that time <,>
economy was totally paralysed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#41:2:B>
Unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#42:2:B>
International confiderate has been total collapse <,> and
industrial production was falling <,> and inflation was <,> on right thing
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#43:2:B>
And then <,> honourable Narasimha Rao taken up the leadership of
this country as a prime minister <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#44:2:B>
And Mr Manmohan Singh <,> when he became the finance minister of
this country <,> then whatever economically beneficial <,> for such largest
populated country of the world <,> he has <,> sort out properly <,> and he
has brought out the reforms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#45:2:B>
And we are today <,> we are getting the fruits of <-> for </->
those reforms <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#46:2:B>
Madam you know <,> and I also know we talked on the state to state
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#47:2:B>
You know that our Maharashtra is most agriculturally and
economically advance state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#48:2:B>
It is not only due to Bombay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#49:2:B>
We are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar
factories more successfully <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#50:2:B>
We are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#51:2:B>
We are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton <,>
and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in
Bombay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#52:2:B>
And if something goes wrong in Bombay <,> if war started somebody
<,> from Bombay <,> so total economy will be collapsed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#53:2:B>
This is the wrong policy <,> please for the one state you adopt
this policy of the decentralisation <,> of the industries to the rural and
economically backward areas of this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#54:2:B>
Unless you do that <,> our countrymen <,> our people <,> they will
never excuse you <,> either <mention> BJP </mention> will be <O> one or two
words </O> or any other party will be <O> one or two words </O> has no
meaning <,> it is totally insignificant <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#55:2:B>
But the main significant thing is that <,> then important thing is
that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic
policies <,> that is the main concern <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#56:2:B>
That should be main concern about the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#57:2:B>
I was reading in todays one of the press about the Duncan Agreement
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#58:2:B>
Government is going to accept the Duncan Agreement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#59:2:B>
I don't know <,,> I have not <,,> fully studied the Duncan
Agreement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#60:2:B>
But government how they discuss about the Duncan Agreement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#61:2:B>
What is the Duncan Agreement <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#62:2:B>
What it is going to do harm <-> to </-> the farmers <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#63:2:B>
How it will be beneficial to the farmers <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#64:2:B>
Farmers are against Madam for <,> taxing the agriculturists <,> but
the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#65:2:B>
How much he is getting in his farm <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#66:2:B>
Or how much output he is getting <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#67:2:B>
We have categorically demanded in this house <,> this agriculture
commodity should be given the regulatory prices <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#68:2:B>
You <O> one or two words </O> industry <,,> you allow us to
increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move <,> when
you <,> you you you just gather sympathy to pretend but do not hike <,> but
at one <,> at one <,,> side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture
<}> <-> <.> pro </.> </-> <=> prices </=> </}> of agriculture commodity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#69:2:B>
Madam about the modernisation of the industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#70:2:B>
So about the modernisation of industry <,> much help needed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#71:2:B>
But I must say that <,> as I have stated yesterday also <,> <}> <->
<.> wh </.> </-> <=> while </=> </}> discussing about the <,> NTC <,> the
National Textile Corporation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#72:2:B>
See modernisation process is a continous process <,,> and any
industry is coming out <,> any licence is given <,> licence are delicenced
but it must be made compulsory that <,> they must have their own research
laboratory <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#73:2:B>
They must find out their own technology <,> and they must try to
modernise their industry <,> as and when required

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#74:2:B>
That is very essential

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#75:2:B>
Our budget should not be the deficit budget <,> it must be the
surplus budget <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#76:2:B>
Our export must be much more greater than the <,> import <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#77:2:B>
We are given several concession for the import <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#78:2:B>
We are giving several concession for the export also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#79:2:B>
But we must <+> do </+> all this <,> at the same time we must see
that <,> what we are exporting <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#80:2:B>
And we must push the export of agriculture commodity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#81:2:B>
Because in Maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the
mangoes <,,> to export the <,> grapes <,> to export the <,> we are demanding
that you can give us the concession <,> to export five to fifteen lakhs of
cattle milk <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#82:2:B>
And if we export something <,> and we get this foreign exchange <,>
then we can give better prices to the farmers also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#83:2:B>
So now the time has come <,> we are not to <,> think twice that <,>
we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural
commodity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#84:2:B>
Madam I did not <,> I will not go uh <,> in the detail but I wanted
to demand in this house <,> as the discussion is going on <,> on the budget
<,> so that <,> special financial provisions have to be made for the <,>
development of economically backward region <,> for Marathwada Vidarbha and
parts of Konkan in Maharashtra <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#85:2:B>
In this very house <,> <w> I'm </w> <,> in this very house we have
several time demanded <,> that uh <,> category development board should be
created for the backward regions of <,> Maharashtra <,> Marathwada Vidharba
and parts of Konkan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#86:2:B>
Government has never agreed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#87:2:B>
But at least you must make this situation higher than provision <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#88:2:B>
What is backlog of those region <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#89:2:B>
Others is <,> if <,> then when you have to mention this special
financial assistance is given for the development of the economically
backward regions of this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#90:2:B>
Another important thing is that <,> industrialisation of sugar
factory <,> spinning mills <,> food processing industries <,> horticulture
development programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#91:2:B>
Whatever demands are from Maharashtra they should be solved within
no time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#92:2:B>
Creation of proper road communication <,> conversion of state
highways into national highways <,> they are demanding this from Maharashtra
for the last so many years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#93:2:B>
Special financial assitance for irrigation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#94:2:B>
As the Krishna and Godavari valley projects are not completed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#95:2:B>
If we could not complete those projects by two thousand AD our plan
will go <,> and whole Maharashtra will not get any water <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#96:2:B>
So the special financial assistance should be given for the
irrigation project which are to come up in Krishna and Godavari valley <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#97:2:B>
And laying out a special pipeline

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#98:2:B>
Now <,> in this house we have this is the last discussion I am
taking Madam

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#99:2:B>
The <,> uhm while discussing the <O> one or two words </O>
questions and some other uh items <,> in this house I have said that I did
not take down the LPG pipe line <,> which is <}> <-> <.> co </.> </-> <=>
coming </=> </}> from Bombay High <,> to the Jagdishpur <,> and even your
enquiry <O> a few words </O> said

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#100:2:B>
On the same line <,> we demanded in this house that we must have
some <,> a pipe line which can carry the Bombay High gas <,> from Maharashtra
to southern India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#101:2:B>
It must go from the Maharashtra <,> Vidarbha Marathwada <,> then
Karnataka <,> then Andhra <,> then Tamil Nadu <,> so like this the several
pipelines which can carry the Bombay High <,> surplus gas <,> inspite of
clearing up the gas <,> worth upto fourteen hundred <indig> crores </indig>
per year

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#102:2:B>
You please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the
southern India <,> so that the farmers <,> there <O> two words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#103:2:B>
So that our <,> farmers of the southern India will be benefitted

<ICE-IND:S1B-053#104:2:B>
With this few lines I I suppose this so <O> one or two words </O>
and thank you very much for <O> one word </O> <,,> </I>
