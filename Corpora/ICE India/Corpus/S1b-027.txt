<ICE-IND:S1B-027#1:1:A>
There are ten days to go <,,> and then we will witness <,,> the
elections in Punjab <,,> which perhaps are going to be the most difficult <,>
ever held in this country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#2:1:A>
<w> It's </w> not known how many people <,,> will <,,> or will feel
free <,,> to come and participate in them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#3:1:A>
Uh what kind of uh <,> state of <,,> disturbance there might or
might not be <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#4:1:A>
And therefore what kind of value should one attach <,,> to this
exercise <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#5:1:A>
What does it hold <}> <-> in in the </-> <=> in </=> </}> terms of
the future of Punjab <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#6:1:A>
These are some of the questions which uh <,,> <w> I'm </w> going to
explore this evening with a group of <,,> very experienced observers of the
scene <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#7:1:A>
On my <,> immediate left is Mr Prem Bhatia <,,> chief editor of the
<mention> Tribune </mention> <,,> at on time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#8:1:A>
Khuswant Singh <,,> probably the best known <,,> non-political
Punjabi I would say <O> laughter </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#9:1:A>
And Mr Girilal Jain <,> formerly chief editor <,> of the <,>
<mention> Times of India </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#10:1:A>
I know <w> it's </w> a difficult question to answer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#11:1:A>
We can only guess <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#12:1:A>
But let me invite your <,,> best <,> guess estimate <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#13:1:A>
On first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh <,,>
it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a
substantial proportion of people will come forward <,> to participate in them
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#14:1:A>
And I mean <,> I think thereafter it would be necessary for us to
look into the question <,> what is it that can be done between now <,> and
the day of polling which would possibly <,> improves the chances <,> of a
higher voter turn-out <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#15:1:A>
Prem would you like to have the first shot at it <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#16:1:B>
Well the <,,> reaction <,> public reaction at the moment <,,>
and that is <,,> fairly good criterion <,,> of uh <,> making an assessment
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#17:1:B>
The public reaction is a mixture of <,,> despair <,,> cynicism <,>
and some hope <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#18:1:A>
I I <w> I'll </w> suggest <w> let's </w> go into the reasons
later but give your <,> short answers first <,> put your uh <,> what shall
you say your guess on the table <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#19:1:B>
When <w> we'll </w> explore it <,> the guess about the future
<,> about the participation level <,> Punjab has been known for a very high
percentage of voting in the past <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#20:1:B>
Never less than sixty percent <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#21:1:A>
Yeah sixty-seven <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#22:1:B>
Never less than <{> <[> sixty </[> <,,> at the worst of times
<,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#23:1:A>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#24:1:C>
Well I would be a great optimistic if I would say sixty
percent are going to turn-out <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#25:1:C>
My own guess would be closer to thirty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#26:1:C>
And I think <w> we'll </w> be lucky if we get thirty percent <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#27:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#28:1:D>
Well my <}> <-> <.> ques </.> </-> <=> answer </=> </}> won't
be as brief because <w> I've </w> just been looking at the <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#29:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> I <{> <[> give you a </[> second by to the <O>
one word </O> later

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#30:1:D>
<[> To record </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#31:1:D>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#32:1:A>
<w> What's </w> your pretty guess

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#33:1:D>
I you know <w> it's </w> not as easy as that

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#34:1:D>
I I as Prem said that <,> uh Punjab has a <,> uh a very good record
of large turn-out

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#35:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#36:1:D>
Uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent <,> when a
boycott has been called <,> in the past <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#37:1:D>
Uh this time <w> I'm </w> not sure the boycott is being called
again <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#38:1:D>
But I I <,> the general impression as <w> I've </w> seen is that if
<,> the polling is above sixty percent <,> it will be regarded as a success
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#39:1:D>
If it is between <,> forty to fifty percent <,> <w> it's </w> a
draw <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#40:1:D>
And if it is under forty percent <,> then the boycotters will have
that uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#41:1:A>
<}> <-> Would you </-> <=> would you </=> </}> have a little
range in mind

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#42:1:A>
<}> <-> Do you </-> <=> do you </=> </}> think <}> <-> how far </->
<,> <=> how far </=> </}> up and how far down <,> it should be ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#43:1:D>
I I think you be <{> <[> don't wish to make <O> one or two
words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#44:1:A>
<[> Would not like to make a guess </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#45:1:A>
Giri would you <,> speak what you make out

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#46:1:C>
If it is one-third <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> if it is around
thirty-five percent <,> <{2> <[2> yes <,> I would regard it as a success <{>
<[> even </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#47:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#48:1:A>
<[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#49:1:A>
<[> Would </[> </{> you would you expect thirty-five percent
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#50:1:A>
Do you think it will be ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#51:1:C>
I don't think it will be <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#52:1:C>
It would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#53:1:A>
Perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and
thirty-five is <,> really making it very precise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#54:1:A>
I want to address uh one <,> question to you in this very question
our level of participation

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#55:1:A>
You know the Assam election <,> where the percentage of voter
turn-out <{1> <[1> much lower <,> four percent <{2> <[2> yeah <,> to be exact
<,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#56:1:C>
<[1> Much lower </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#57:1:C>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#58:1:A>
People have been saying uh <,> what is the use of an election
like that <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#59:1:C>
Whatever the <,> voter turn-out actually may <,> happen to be
<,,> I think it would be a mistake <,> to overlook the fact <,> that this
voter turn-out would have occured <,,> inspite of <,> the extensive fear of
violence <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#60:1:C>
In Assam there was no such fear at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#61:1:C>
A J P had not held out any threat <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#62:1:C>
But people were not inclined to vote <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#63:1:C>
They were not with the election <,> and therefore the four percent
voter turn- out <,> was a clear indication of what their political opinion
was <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#64:1:C>
In the present case I would say that the low turn-out or not in my
view be regarded as <,,> a rejection of the political process <,> because
there would be an element in it of <,> fear of voting rather than <}> <-> a
</-> <+> an </+> </}> aversion to vote <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#65:1:C>
Would you agree on that assessment of <,,> the political weight of
whatever the figure might turn-out to be

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#66:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> suppose <,> fear of voting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#67:1:B>
They don't want to be killed <,,> maimed for life <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#68:1:B>
And the other things is I think there is <,> I said earlier <,> a
touch of cynicism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#69:1:B>
What will happen people say <,> now supposing <}> <-> an <.> elec
</.> </-> <,> <=> an election </=> </}> takes place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#70:1:B>
Uh attempts were made to form a government <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#71:1:B>
Where is it going to lead us <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#72:1:B>
What would the government <,> <}> <-> <.> pe </.> </-> <=> people
</=> </}> think in those terms <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#73:1:B>
And therefore as I said this element of despair <,,> the voter <,>
potential voter <,,> is not sure whether this election is going to lead
anywhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#74:1:B>
That is the dominant mood today

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#75:1:A>
Yeah but uh <,> votes have not on the other hand <?> become
</?> if people were to free to vote <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#76:1:A>
Vote for that itself become a reason <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#77:1:A>
While they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead
somewhere <,> that it doesn't lead the electoral process <,> and therefore
the future of Punjab hanging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#78:1:A>
If on the other hand <,> it were cynicism <,> without the
enforcement of a boycott by fear <,> then it would be a different <,> picture

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#79:1:A>
Kushwant <,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#80:1:D>
Well I think there is one thing which complicates the
situation

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#81:1:D>
The Punjab in which <,> I think you must bear in mind <,> because
the problem of the Punjab <,> <-> in </-> very roughly put is the problem of
the Sikhs <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#82:1:D>
And I think <w> it's </w> more important to bear in mind <,> what
proportion of <{> <[> Sikh electorate </[> go to the poll <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#83:1:A>
<[> What voters go </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#84:1:D>
And <}> <-> the the may </-> <,> <=> simple way </=> </}> of
looking at it is the <,> urban and the rural <,> voting for the Sikh is
largely rural <,> the Hindu is largely urban

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#85:1:D>
Uh <,> and the <,> there is no doubt that in <,> cities Ludhiana
<,> Jalandhar <,> Amritsar <,> there is likely to be larger turn- out <,>
because the Hindu presence is there much larger <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#86:1:D>
Than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the <{> <[> rural <}> <->
<.> ar </.> </-> <=> areas </=> </}> </[> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#87:1:A>
<[> Rural areas </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#88:1:D>
And uh <,> we should <,> watch and analyse <,> that mood <,>
to find out whether there is any substance whether <,> the so called
grievances of the Sikhs which the <mention> <w> Akali's </w> </mention> have
been <,> talking about <,> the terrorist <,> have been talking about <,>
whether <w> they've </w> really gone down to the people themselves <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#89:1:A>
<O> One or two word </O> uh since you are willing to speculate
<,> I am glad you do <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#90:1:A>
Would you say that the greater disincentive to <,> voter
participation <,> among the Sikhs <,> would you say that the greater
disincentive is going to be <,> cynicism <,> disinterest or <,> fear <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#91:1:C>
Well I expect it would be a combination of the three and I
think the <,> the situation will vary from area to area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#92:1:C>
Uh you take the three old traditional <,> divisions of the Punjab
<,> Maza Malwa and <,,> Doab

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#93:1:C>
The largest group is in Malwa <,> where I think the turn-out will
be there

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#94:1:C>
All because <,> <{> <[> <O> one or two words <,> <w> it's </w> a
prosperous area as a green belt <,> uh area

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#95:1:C>
And we already had <,> people like uh Amandar Singh being elected

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#96:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#97:1:A>
Yeah yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#98:1:C>
And of course <,> where the terrorist are more active <,> the
Maza <,> <}> <-> <.> Gu </.> </-> <=> Gurdaspur </=> </}> Amritsar <,>
Kapurthala in <,> the Doab area <,> uh there the turn-out will inevitably be
less

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#99:1:C>
Because the fear of the terrorist is much more there <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#100:1:A>
Giri uh <,> since you came down to a very precise prediction
<,> <w> let's </w> assume for the sake of argument <,> that something like
thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#101:1:A>
Taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent
<,> taking into account if <w> Khuswant's </w> fear turn-out fears turn out
to be true <,> that the voter turn out among the Sikhs may be lower and only
the total may be thirty percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#102:1:A>
What you think should be the attitude of uh <,,> the rest of the
country <,> or government of India you might say <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#103:1:A>
To a government that would be formed <,> as a result of that
election <,> would you regard it as a legitimate government <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#104:1:B>
You see <}> <-> this is </-> <,> <=> this election </=> </}>
<,> is an act of desperation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#105:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#106:1:B>
The government of India has decided to go in for elections
<,,> because nothing else has worked <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#107:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#108:1:B>
The government of India knows that <,> the law under
situation is far from <,> what it should be <,> for elections to be held
properly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#109:1:B>
We all know it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#110:1:B>
It is also obvious that <,> the threat <,,> is much more acute in
<,,> dispersed rural areas <,,> than in large cities <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#111:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#112:1:B>
<w> It's </w> much easier to protect <,,> people in cities
than in <,> rural areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#113:1:B>
So <,> the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside
<,> than in the larger <,> urban centres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#114:1:B>
The Hindu-Sikh problem <,> is a fact <,> which can not be
disregarded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#115:1:B>
And if the Sikh turn out <,> I mean Sikhs are concentrated in the
rural areas <,> and if their turn-out is smaller <,> than in the cities <,>
than to that election <,> to that extent <,> the election result will be <,,>
not so helpful <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#116:1:B>
But there is no option now

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#117:1:A>
There is no option and <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#118:1:B>
And the government <,> that result from it <,> should be
regarded as legitimate <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#119:1:A>
Alright

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#120:1:B>
Only I would add one thing that <,> <-> if </-> the <,> <->
that that </-> government must be very sensitive <,,> to the reality <,> of
the situation in Punjab <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#121:1:A>
Sure <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#122:1:C>
I I want to <,> suggest one yardstick for <,,> guessing <,,>
how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#123:1:C>
And how much on account of aversion <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#124:1:C>
The very fact <,,> that there are threats being held out <,> that
<quote> if you vote <,> <w> we'll </w> kill you </quote> <,,> indicates that
in the minds of those who are holding out the threats <,,> there is a
recognition <,> that in the absence of the threat people will vote <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#125:1:C>
That it is not so if if they were convinced <,> that people are so
cynical <,> that they will not go to vote any how <,> it would not be
necessary to prevent them <,> with threats

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#126:1:C>
And I go back to the example of the A J P in Assam <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#127:1:C>
A J P held out no such threat of the kind <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#128:1:C>
<w> It's </w> position was known that <quote> we do not like these
elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#129:1:C>
There after they left it to the judgement of the people because
they knew that the people were with them <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#130:1:C>
Is it not the case than Prem <,> that the element of fear is the
predominant deterrent and not <,> either cynisism <,> or uncertainity about
what the elections will produce <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#131:1:B>
Uh I don't know whether if one can measure it in precise
terms <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#132:1:B>
But uh <,> <}> <-> I would </-> <=> I would </=> </}> like to say
that <,,> another element which comes from uh <,,> the present attitude that
belong to the present attitude <,> is one of sulk <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#133:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#134:1:B>
Now I don't think that the population at large <,> the Sikhs
<,> I mean <,,> you have put your <,,> finger on the pulse of the uh <,> the
temper of the State <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#135:1:B>
Among the Sikhs <,> even among the Sikhs this sulking element <,>
is not as large <,,> among the masses as among the leaders <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#136:1:B>
The Sikh population is not sulking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#137:1:B>
They are unhappy <,> they are cynical to the extent that they
don't think much is going to come out of it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#138:1:B>
But I think <,,> down in their hearts they think <w> it's </w>
worth trying <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#139:1:B>
They are fed up <,,> with the negative <,> state of things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#140:1:B>
And uh <,> they don't go into the technicalities of uh <,>
elections like you I do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#141:1:B>
But there is uh <w> heaven's </w> sake get us out of this mess

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#142:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#143:1:B>
And if this is the only way alright we would like to vote
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#144:1:B>
There is the element of fear <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#145:1:B>
But then I think some of them <,> turn back and say <quote> well
what than is going to come out of it </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#146:1:B>
So there are these two conflicts

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#147:1:D>
Uh I

<$A>

As Pran told at the last election we had the same threats <,>
<{> <[> yeah <,> and yet the turn out was over <{> <[> fifty-seven <O> few
words </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#149:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#150:1:C>
<[> Yeah I think first of all </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#151:1:B>
Which last election <,> ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#152:1:C>
Both the Parliamentary and the Assembly yeah <{> <[> there
was a large turn-out </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#153:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#154:1:A>
<{> <[> Eighty-five eighty-nine </[> both of them

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#155:1:C>
<[> Eighty-five eighty-nine </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#156:1:D>
They defied the threats just went to vote <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#157:1:C>
No no I have

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#158:1:A>
Eighty-nine parliamentary elections <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and
the uh eighty-five <,> uh uh assembly election

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#159:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#160:1:C>
At eighty-five the voters turn-out <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#161:1:C>
At eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections
<,> <{> <[> uhm <,> the voter turn-out was sixty to <?> present </?> plus

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#162:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#163:1:B>
I never do

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#164:1:D>
Sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the
parliamentary <,> in the assembly sixty-seven point five

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#165:1:C>
That was in eighty-five <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#166:1:D>
<w> That's </w> right <,> and <w> it's </w> never been <{>
<[> really <.> al </.> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#167:1:A>
<[> <}> <-> Are you </-> <=> are you </=> </}> </[> </{> <}>
<-> would you </-> <=> would you </=> </}> say that <,> the same kind of
eagerness <,,> to vote <,,> would surface if there was not the fear of the
gun <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#168:1:B>
I somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun
if they have done <,> voted in the past <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> despite a fear of
the gun <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#169:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#170:1:B>
A bigger element is <,,> a kind of indifference <,> it makes
you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets <,> and <w> we'll
</w> get nothing out of them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#171:1:B>
Uh and I think <,> you have to also if there is a sort of
disillusionment with the government <,> there is probably a bigger
disillusionment with the <mention> Akali </mention> factions <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#172:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-027#173:1:B>
And whether the <mention> <w> Akali's </w> </mention> called
for a boycott or not it doesn't matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#174:1:B>
Uh people are <,> would <,> I have got thoroughly fed up of there
<}> <-> <.> in </.> </-> <=> infighting </=> </}> and factionalism

<ICE-IND:S1B-027#175:1:B>
And therefore I have been different <,> whether <mention> Akali
</mention> this wins or <mention> Akali </mention> that wins </I>
