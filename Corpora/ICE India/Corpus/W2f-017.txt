<bold> THE QUESTION WAS, WHO WAS FLEECING WHOM? </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#5:1>
Illustration : Vidya <&> next page, in three columns </&> <&> seven
blank lines </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#6:1>
She walked into the office of Jason Enterprises with some aplomb
and a lot of confidence, and Jason couldn't take his eyes off her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#7:1>
From the moment the glass doors to his cabin had swung open to let her
breeze in - - he had been transfixed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#8:1>
<quote> " Hi there," </quote> she said, casually.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#9:1>
Not at all as if she were talking to the owner of a million dollar
enterprise.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#10:1>
<quote> " I want you to take a look at this." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#11:1>
And with a <w> conjurer's <w> deftness she had spread her fingers
and let drop from within their red splayed mystery a sheaf of drawings.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#12:1>
One more movement of her hand and they fanned out before him: the
most fantastic designs ever.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#13:1>
He recognized them immediately - - they were the creations of a
genius, each line inspired, as it were, to join another to form the blueprint
of the most breathtakingly original dresses he had ever seen.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#14:1>
One look told him all - - they were sure-fire winners.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#15:1>
Because one look was all he gave them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#16:1>
Then he found his gaze, magnet-like, drawn into her own, and she was
smiling at him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#17:1>
A little girl smile, full of hope and confidence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#18:1>
He smiled back.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#19:1>
His mind told him he was smiling at fate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#20:1>
The chance to double his millions - - triple them perhaps.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#21:1>
His mouth went dry at the thought of the millions.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#22:1>
And of the woman <w> who'd </w> help him make them.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#23:1>
He imagined the clothes she had drawn on paper on her body. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#24:1>
<quote> " You like them?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#25:1>
She smiled again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#26:1>
<quote> " I knew you would.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#27:1>
Can I work with you, Mr. Jason?" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#28:1>
The little girl smile had vanished; seduction hung in the air like
the apple in Eden. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#29:1>
He reached out and plucked it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#30:1>
<quote> " I think so.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#31:1>
<w> Let's </w> try some of these out first shall we?" </quote> he
asked.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#32:1>
Suave man of the world; master of the looms again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#33:1>
And so it began.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#34:1>
<w> Jason's </w> success story.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#35:1>
The story of the rest of his life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#36:1>
Things never were the same again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#37:1>
Not at work; where each day became a dazzling game of hare and
hounds.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#38:1>
Only Jason never really knew when he was the hound and when he was
the hunted.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#39:1>
M as she called herself, was everything she promised and more.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#40:1>
Designs poured out of her mind like cotton off the bobbin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#41:1>
Her store of ideas was seemingly inexhaustible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#42:1>
<quote> " She thinks she owns the place," </quote> grumbled
Bernard but Jason ignored <O> drawing </O> <&> fourteen blank lines </&> <&>
two small squares in the middle </&> <&> tantalizer </&> <&> seventeen nlank
lines </&> him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#43:1>
Bernard was old and though he had started Jason off with his designs
when Jason Enterprises first set up shop, he was definitely a fuddy duddy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#44:1>
<quote> " I don't trust her, Jason," </quote> he said, <quote> " <w>
she's </w> too good.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#45:1>
Why should she work for you?

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#46:1>
She can manage quite well on her own - - and wipe you out." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#47:1>
Bernard was obviously a jealous old woman. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#48:1>
Like Theresa - - his wife.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#49:1>
Theresa was turning into quite an old woman herself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#50:1>
Suddenly Jason noticed the lines that ran in downward curves on
either side of her mouth.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#51:1>
A mouth that he had once likened to a rose.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#52:1>
But that was before he met M; years before.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#53:1>
Suddenly he could not help notice the glint of steel in her hair - -
it seemed to emanate from the steel in her heart, in her voice, it had an
edge to it that cut into his patience, especially in the mornings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#54:1>
<quote> " I don't know if <w> it's </w> really work that keeps
you out so late," </quote> <w> she'd </w> say.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#55:1>
Or: <quote> " Why don't you let me try out one of those great
creations you keep raving about?" </quote> such was the burden of <w>
Theresa's </w> song these days.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#56:1>
And Jason wondered how he had ever thought her voice musical; her
company prized. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#57:1>
Yet, she had been a good wife to him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#58:1>
He conceded that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#59:1>
After all he was a just man, even if a bit under <w> M's </w> spell.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#60:1>
Theresa had not only left home and country to settle in a strange
land with him, but had given him her everything - - her <w> father's </w>
wealth which she had smuggled out with her, wrapped in her lingerie; wealth
which he had quickly converted into the empire that he now ruled under his
name - - Jason Enterprises.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#61:1>
All he had had was his knowledge - - no one knew better to spin and
weave and dye what he spun and wove and dyed into a hundred brilliant hues.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#62:1>
All of it would have been naught if Theresa had not given him the
wherewithal to put it to work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#63:1>
Yet she has, the roughness of sandpaper about her now, he
thought, as he buttered his toast, scraping the knife against the brown toast
to drown the cutting edge out of her voice. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#64:1>
M, on the other hand, continued to fascinate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#65:1>
To glitter like a jewel in the sand, tantalizingly out of reach, yet
always just at hand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#66:1>
He knew he had only to reach out to grasp and the sands would close
over the gem and hide it from view.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#67:1>
Yet she was perfect.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#68:1>
Despite Bernard.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#69:1>
She toiled diligently day in and out - - drawing design after winning
design, drawing Jason closer into her net, till he could hardly breathe for
the pain and the ecstasy of being near her. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#70:1>
<quote> " <w> We'll </w> have an exhibition," </quote> she
announced and once again the sheaf of drawings fanned out before him, almost
by themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#71:1>
<quote> " We'll have a <O> Continued on page 42 </O> <O> <&> page
</&> 29 </O> <O> Continued from page 29 </O> sell-out show.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#72:1>
And wipe everyone else out." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#73:1>
He wondered at the glint in her eyes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#74:1>
<w> Bernard's </w> warnings, he thought; then laughed at himself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#75:1>
Bernard was an old, old woman.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#76:1>
She was the perfect employee.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#77:1>
Loyal to a fault.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#78:1>
He knew that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#79:1>
If only he could get her to forget her role; stop being only a
designer <*> dotted line</*> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#80:1>
M did exactly that.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#81:1>
She moved off from the drawing boards and stormed the tailoring
rooms, taking charge effortlessly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#82:1>
Jason watched indulgently as she whipped lazy fingers into magical
gymnastics with the needle, as she guided the master tailors to turn their
theories inside out and make their scissors chase the lines of her incredible
sketches.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#83:1>
The grumbling turned to mummers of admiration; turning dissent to
approval, as each miraculous creation made a mannequin look like Galatea come
alive.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#84:1>
Even Bernard was convinced.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#85:1>
He had been wrong. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#86:1>
<w> Jason's </w> life took a turn around again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#87:1>
The merry-go-round he had found himself on the time M first breezed
into his room now whirled more fiercely than ever.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#88:1>
A strange sunshine flooded his being - - well-being, confidence.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#89:1>
In a week he would win over his competitors; in a month <w> he'd </w>
take over their business; and then he knew it in his blood as surely as on
that first, fateful day - - <w> he'd </w> get M too.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#90:1>
Or <w> she'd </w> get him more likely.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#91:1>
For he knew now that she was reaching at him through the haze of many
hued chiffons and textured silks.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#92:1>
He was the golden prize she was after.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#93:1>
And <w> she'd </w> get him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#94:1>
Or he her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#95:1>
He felt dizzy with elation. </p> <*> star</*> <*> star</*> <*>
star</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#96:1>
Even Theresa was suddenly looking more desirable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#97:1>
With success at hand, Jason began to feel mellow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#98:1>
The old girl wasn't so bad after all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#99:1>
He was just being a husband seeing faults in her all the time.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#100:1>
After all she had done for him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#101:1>
And besides he needed her around.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#102:1>
He knew that even when her voice acquired that cutting edge, even
when the steel in her hair blinded his eyes to the past.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#103:1>
The day Theresa went - - everything would pack up and crumble.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#104:1>
Hers was the will that held his empire up - - hers the power that
kept the moneylines pumping.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#105:1>
Long years ago, in a foolish lovesick moment he had signed a pact.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#106:1>
Life without Theresa was worth nothing - - <O> drawing </O> <O>
below the drawing a box in which tantalizer 2 <O> she had given him her
everything he had felt compelled to make as grand a gesture towards her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#107:1>
To show his overwhelming love, and to shake off some of the burden
of gratitude.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#108:1>
The day Theresa left him, or died, or turned to stone as neglected
wives are wont to do the day their great partnership dissolved - - though of
course, the day would never come, so great was their love - - his empire
would crumble.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#109:1>
He had willed it, and sworn it all the same.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#110:1>
They had sealed the pact before the powers that be, and signed it in
blood.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#111:1>
Their blood mingled in a saucer of mother of pearl, and used as ink.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#112:1>
Her fingernail the pen.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#113:1>
And in return, destiny had vowed them eternal bliss.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#114:1>
The bliss of togetherness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#115:1>
Fool!

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#116:1>
His voice startled him - - but his mind continued to curse and rave.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#117:1>
How could he not know that the softness would turn mouldy, that the
gold would turn to steel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#118:1>
Yet, she wasn't so bad after all.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#119:1>
After all, he was not quite Don Juan himself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#120:1>
Even when he held his breath and tightened his stomach; darkened his
hair. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#121:1>
He would pamper Theresa.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#122:1>
Make up to her.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#123:1>
Make the old magic work again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#124:1>
So he would feel no betrayal when he finally got M. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#125:1>
M - - that was destined to be.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#126:1>
He had known her in past lives - - or past eons - - and the meteor
had blazed across his firmament again, and they were bound to clash.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#127:1>
M was destiny.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#128:1>
So was Theresa.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#129:1>
One more precious than the other.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#130:1>
For if M fed his empire and fattened it; Theresa kept it alive.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#131:1>
Her life blood pulsed in its veins; her heartbeat throbbed in it.
</p> <*> star</*> <*> star</*> <*> star</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#132:1>
The day of the exhibition the town went wild.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#133:1>
Women queued up outside his doors hours before dawn, waiting for the
event to begin.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#134:1>
Jason Enterprises was a beehive.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#135:1>
Fingers flew like spindles making miracles happen.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#136:1>
Last minute arrangements made the place a fairyland.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#137:1>
M was everywhere, singing now, in a sweet, high-pitched voice, words
no one could understand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#138:1>
But her spirit was contagious and how they had worked all night to
get the place ready. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#139:1>
Women oohed and aahed; and an old dowager fainted right away at
the sheer beauty of the clothes.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#140:1>
M had vetoed models - - she had set up the mannequins instead,
dressing them to the last detail, till they stood startlingly lifelike and
wondrously beautiful, clad in her creations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#141:1>
Within the first hour half the dresses had <quote> ` Sold'
</quote> tags on them; by the second hour the doors had to be closed to
prevent a stampede.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#142:1>
People would be let in in batches; the store would remain open till
midnight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#143:1>
Bulbs flashed, the photographers went crazy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#144:1>
Order books filled with <O> <&> page </&> 43 </O> meticulously
crabbed writing as Bernard pushed his fingers past their pain threshold.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#145:1>
Inch tapes broke with overuse, and a great trunk full of spools had
to be emptied to accommodate the money that came in as advance cash. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#146:1>
M was rosy cheeked with excitement.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#147:1>
Jason bit his lip, stopping the moan that rose to his mouth - - she
had never looked more desirable.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#148:1>
He moved towards her - - it would be easy now, at this moment when
she was flushed with success but his step faltered.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#149:1>
His eye glazed, then focused on the face he knew, alas so well. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#150:1>
Theresa stood barely a step away, rapt in admiration of a gold
chiffon dress.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#151:1>
She had not seen him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#152:1>
Or even M for the matter. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#153:1>
<quote> " Mrs. Jason." </quote> M moved like satin to grasp <w>
Theresa's </w> surprised hand.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#154:1>
Jason tasted blood on his bitten lip.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#155:1>
His worlds had clashed, and he felt the impact almost tangibly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#156:1>
He could not hear much of what the two women said and he did not
want to.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#157:1>
His mind was busy seeking another strategy.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#158:1>
Something that would wipe out this setback.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#159:1>
Get him closer to M again. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#160:1>
He turned compelled - - to catch M giving him a radiant smile -
- her eyes alight and ripe with promise. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#161:1>
<quote> " <w> There's </w> Mr. Jason," </quote> she said, and
Theresa fluttered up to him looking soft and radiant, her eyes shining, her
hair flecked with long forgotten gold, her mouth a tempting rose bud.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#162:1>
<quote> " What a beautiful surprise," </quote> she said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#163:1>
<quote> " <w> You're </w> a darling." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#164:1>
And there to his surprise, Theresa threw her arms around him and
hugged him tight. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#165:1>
If he showed his surprise, Theresa did not notice it.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#166:1>
She was looking at M again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#167:1>
M, who held in her hand a dress in blue and gold. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#168:1>
It seemed to Jason that he had never seen a dress such as this -
- and he had inspected every one in the store.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#169:1>
It was an evening gown, cut in a bridal fullness - - the soft
gossamer folds gathered at the neck, and gently at the waist to fall away in
swirls of sheer poetry.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#170:1>
It seemed as if a spider has spun the yarn out of the sunshine for
it - - and the sky had shredded itself to contribute to the blue stars that
shone in the background.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#171:1>
Jason felt he could hear angels singing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#172:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> beautiful." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#173:1>
<w> Theresa's </w> voice seemed far away - - and he jolted back to
reality.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#174:1>
<quote> " Both of you, thank you.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#175:1>
Jason I don't know what to say <*> dotted line</*> what a lovely
surpirse <*> dotted line</*>" </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#176:1>
Then, womanly common sense took hold.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#177:1>
<quote> " Do you think it will fit?" </quote> </p> <O> drawing at
the beginning if column two </O> <O> in the box, tantalizer 3 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#178:1>
<quote> " Perfectly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#179:1>
This is a secret magical design," </quote> M explained, as if to a
child.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#180:1>
Theresa, after all, knew nothing of her powers.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#181:1>
Jason she knew hadn't told her; wasn't quite sure of them himself.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#182:1>
<quote> " The design is made to fit anyone - - perfectly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#183:1>
And this, I have created, especially for you." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#184:1>
The crowds froze, tranfixed by the dress as M held it up, and it
caught the light - - and bounced it off, caught the light and swallowed it,
then bounced it back again.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#185:1>
The room seemed to grow dark in comparison.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#186:1>
The gold seemed to be the light of a million fireflies. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#187:1>
<quote> " Can I try it on?" </quote> asked Theresa, her voice a
<w> child's </w> voice asking to taste her birthday cake. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#188:1>
Jason found his voice.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#189:1>
Turning chaos into triumph, he smiled his old world,
we-are-one-of-a-kind smile at Theresa, and glowed a little as she spilled her
wonderment all over him. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#190:1>
And then she was gone - - dress floating behind her, held aloft
by M, who meek as a handmaiden, followed behind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#191:1>
Jason swelled with pride.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#192:1>
He chose his women well.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#193:1>
The best or perhaps the best women chose him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#194:1>
It did not matter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#195:1>
When Theresa came out, wearing that dream of a dress, designed by
the dream he hoped to turn to reality, the world would stop and gasp. </p>

The voice cut through the room like a shard of ice, but it was the
fire that caused it that transfixed Jason.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#198:1>
The dressing room was in a blaze - - the very room Theresa had
entered with M following close behind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#199:1>
For one horrible moment Jason saw it clearly.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#200:1>
His destiny.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#201:1>
The dress going up in flames and devouring Theresa, till only ashes
remained.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#202:1>
Ashes and the dull sparkle of revenge.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#203:1>
M laughing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#204:1>
M <*> dotted line</*> he had it now - - why the voice had rung a
bell in his memory.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#205:1>
Even the songs she sang were clear to him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#206:1>
M.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#207:1>
Media, of another life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#208:1>
Medea, the woman he had loved and abandoned in a life lived long
ago.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#209:1>
Theresa, the woman he was abandoning now.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#210:1>
Medea, who many eons ago, in another, far off, long forgotten birth
had given her <w> father's </w> wealth, the golden fleece, to him - - Jason,
the Argonaut.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#211:1>
Destiny mocked - - and he could hear.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#212:1>
<w> M's </w> laughter as she shrieked in agony, caught by the very
fire that had torched his wife.

<ICE-IND:W2F-017#213:1>
The shop emptied in seconds. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#214:1>
The short circuit that turned <w> Theresa's </w> new dress into
a torch had burned her to nothing; and M had died horribly, cut off by <w>
Theresa's </w> blazing body from the dressing room door. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#215:1>
Jason, master of Jason Enterprises, looked back over his lives -
- and into his future ones. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-017#216:1>
