<ICE-IND:S1B-041#1:1:A>
<w> There're </w> over fifteen thousand primary health centres
and sub-centres in the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#2:1:A>
<w> There're </w> over one hundred thousand <,> sub-centres <,>
located scattered throughout the country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#3:1:A>
Life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six <,> to around fifty-six

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#4:1:A>
Today <,> health care is available in urban and <,> rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#5:1:A>
Plague and small-pox have been eradicated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#6:1:A>
Malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#7:1:A>
The general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand
<,> to eleven per thousand <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#8:1:A>
Infant mortality <,> has declined sharply <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#9:1:A>
Much has been done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#10:1:A>
Much more <,> remains to be done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#11:1:A>
How far are we from our national goal of <mention> health for all
</mention> by the year two thousand A D <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#12:1:A>
What new programmes are being evolved <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#13:1:A>
What is the present state <,> of public health care in India <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#14:1:A>
These are some of the questions that we would like to put to our
distinguished guest the Union Health Secretary <indig> Sri </indig> R
Srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#15:1:A>
<w> We've </w> also said to you a little while ago that we were
expecting the presence of Dr G K Vishvakarma <,> Director General of Health
Services

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#16:1:A>
Unfortunately Dr Vishvakarma has not been able to join us

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#17:1:A>
He has possibly <,> been held up somewhere <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#18:1:A>
Mr Srinivasan thank you very much for joining us <,> <{> <[> yeah
<,> on the morning show

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#19:1:A>
<w> We're </w> honoured and delighted to have you with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#20:1:A>
So first of all may I on behalf of the <,> family of the morning
show congratulate you on your election as Chairman <,> of the Executive Board
of the World Health Organisation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#21:1:A>
This is a tribute to you personally and to the country that <{> <[>
you represent </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#22:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#23:1:B>
<[> First the </[> </{> country especially

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#24:1:A>
Thank you very much sir <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#25:1:A>
Mr Secretary <,> are you satisfied with the present state of health
care in India <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#26:1:B>
<w> That's </w> a very large question and uh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#27:1:B>
You know <w> let's </w> get this in perspective <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#28:1:B>
I think you know every <,> sixth human being is an Indian <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#29:1:A>
Uhm uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#30:1:B>
So if <w> you're </w> going to get our <,> health of India
alright <w> we're </w> going to do an enormous of might of work for the
health of the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#31:1:B>
And uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as
health care <,> facilities are concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#32:1:B>
<w> That's </w> been an area of development <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#33:1:B>
As you said earlier you know <,> we certainly made a tremendous
impact in death rates <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#34:1:B>
Infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#35:1:B>
Death rates have also <,> tended to decline but not <+> to </+> the
extent we wanted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#36:1:B>
But of the sight of disease <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#37:1:B>
Our diseases are broadly <,> diseases due to infection <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#38:1:B>
Diseases due to malnutrition <,,> and life-style <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#39:1:B>
<w> We've </w> made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have
been touched <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#40:1:B>
Diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic
development <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#41:1:B>
As far as life-style is concerned like cancer <,> sex diseases and
so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#42:1:B>
But this is an urban phenomenon largely <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#43:1:B>
If you ask me what are the brighter parts <,> so far <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#44:1:B>
I mean certainly <w> we've </w> done well in leprosy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#45:1:B>
Every <,> fourth leprosy patient in the world is an Indian <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#46:1:B>
And every fifth leprosy patient in India is a child <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#47:1:B>
<w> It's </w> very enormous burden <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#48:1:B>
And by the year two thousand <,,> it may not <}> <-> may </-> <+>
be </+> </}> possible to eradicate it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#49:1:B>
<w> It's </w> certainly it would be possible to have <,> a
tremendous dent <,> because of the multi drug therapy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#50:1:B>
Which gurantees you <,> complete freedom from leprosy in about two
and half years <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#51:1:A>
Mr Secretary <w> you've </w> talked about the brighter spots
on the health being <,> <indig> kamiyan kaun kaun si hai </indig> <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#52:1:B>
<indig> Kamiyan to saheb <,> thi hai <,> ek to hai </indig>
malaria <indig> ke bare mein </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#53:1:B>
Malaria <indig> ko hamne hataya <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#54:1:B>
Ab kafi door tak chalagaya <,,> sirf ek wapas agayi <,> do teen
karan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#55:1:B>
Ek karan hai <,> jo daviyaan </indig> <,,> pesticides <indig> thi
unki </indig> resistance <indig> ho gayi </indig> <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> <indig>
doosra hai ke </indig> water bodies development <indig> se chalti bahut <O>
one word </O> hote jarahe <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#56:1:B>
Aur </indig> infected <indig> log to itne </indig> migration
<indig> hota hai </indig> labour population <indig> ka </indig> <,,>
infection <indig> ek jagah se doosri jagah </indig> parasite <indig> chala
jata hai </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#57:1:B>
As you probably know <,> malaria is different from mosquito
available

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#58:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#59:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#60:1:B>
There may be mosquitoes with no malaria <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#61:1:B>
But when the mosquito carries the parasite <,> and injects it into
the blood system <,> then the man becomes infected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#62:1:B>
And there is another aspect <,> I think people who understand and
want to discuss about public health issues in India must remember this <,,>
that for the poor people <,> health is not a priority <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#63:1:B>
Priority is illness <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#64:1:B>
And how to get out of sickness as soon as possible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#65:1:B>
So if you don't have <,> the full regimen of medicine <,> you get
back incompletely cured <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#66:1:B>
Malaria comes back then

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#67:1:A>
You raised this <,> question of about <,> the poorer sections
of society

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#68:1:A>
Now in <,> every developing country I presume there is a certain
dicotomy <,> between the level of health care available in the rural areas
<indig> gramin kshetra mein jis prakar ke haspatal hain ye </indig> health
care <indig> hai aur jo </indig> urban areas <indig> milte hai </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#69:1:A>
Why <,> does one have the impression that it is particularly acute
in India <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#70:1:B>
<indig> Nahi saheb <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#71:1:B>
Dekhye </indig> <w> we're </w> confusing two issues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#72:1:B>
<w> There's </w> the issue of rural health infrastructure <,,> and
rural health needs <,,> versus urban health need <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#73:1:B>
Though the poor in both areas <,> deserves the same <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#74:1:B>
This question has been tackled in our planning <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#75:1:B>
<w> We've </w> done well <,> not enough <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#76:1:B>
<w> We're </w> going to do more <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#77:1:B>
<indig> Yeh nai </indig> government <indig> ki niti hai ke jyada se
jyada </indig> rural areas <indig> mein </indig> resources <indig> banao
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#78:1:B>
Health <indig> to </indig> State subject <indig> hai aur </indig>
State <indig> ki </indig> planning <indig> mein </indig> <,> minimum needs
programme <indig> mein </indig> <,> public health programmes <indig> mein <,>
jyada se jyada </indig> rural infrastructure <indig> badate jayen </indig>
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#79:1:B>
But you see <,> you should not refuse the creation of rural health
infrastructure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#80:1:B>
But what <}> <-> is </-> <+> has </+> </}> come to be known all
over the world as the primary health care approach <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#81:1:A>
What is the difference <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#82:1:B>
In one case we create infrastructure <,> to reach people
dispensaries <indig> haspatals </indig> sub-centre nurse <,> midwife
doctor <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#83:1:B>
But in the case of primary health care approach <,,> <indig> woh
kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#84:1:B>
Let people get <,> access <,> to <,,> medical aid <,> from the
simplest sources <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#85:1:B>
<indig> Kahene ka matlab hai </indig> you must be able to get
eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated <,> at the nearest health
centre

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#86:1:B>
You don't have to go to a hospital

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#87:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#88:1:B>
You also don't require a specialist <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#89:1:B>
You must understand <,> that there are three issues here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#90:1:B>
One is the issue everybody must take care of his health

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#91:1:B>
Government can't take care of his health <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#92:1:B>
Second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#93:1:B>
It has been done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#94:1:B>
The third is <,> everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#95:1:B>
Ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals <,> the health system <,>
can render a tremendous amount of care <,> as near as possible <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#96:1:B>
Now primary health care approach involves rural <}> <-> <.> in </.>
</-> <=> infrastructure </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#97:1:B>
But it is not only rural infrastructure <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> it is a
philosophy <,> that you can take care of your health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#98:1:B>
Community can have a lot of self-help in health <,> and government
can supplement <,> by making available health facilities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#99:1:B>
Now one important facility there is health education <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#100:1:B>
So people can't take care of the health unless they know <,> what
to do about it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#101:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#102:1:A>
Right

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#103:1:A>
<indig> Ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar
dekha hai jo hamare </indig> doctor <indig> hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin
shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte </indig> infact I think <indig> Jee saheb
</indig> was complaning about this <indig> Jee saheb </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#104:1:C>
<indig> Deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#105:1:C>
Balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke Dilli mein bade haspatalon
mein jo </indig> doctor <indig> hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla
Dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah
mil milakar apna apni </indig> transfer <indig> jo hai woh shaher mein <{>
<[> karwa le </[> </indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#106:1:A>
<[> How how </[> </{> would you tackle this problem ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#107:1:B>
No of course not let me say <,> it is not true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#108:1:B>
First of all <,> <w> I've </w> been on behalf of the doctors well
I think <,> mind you there can't be any public health programme in this
country without the leadership <,> and complete involvement of doctors <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#109:1:B>
How <{> <[> can that absolutely </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#110:1:A>
<[> Absolutely absolutely </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#111:1:B>
The doctor has to be the leader of public health <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#112:1:B>
And he must provide the linkages in public health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#113:1:B>
After having said that I would say <,> a very large number of
rural areas are serviced by doctors <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#114:1:B>
Circumstances differ from state to state <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#115:1:B>
If you went to a state like Madras or Maharashtra <,> or even
Bengal <,> a large number of people work in rural areas

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#116:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#117:1:B>
<indig> Magar sawal yeh hai ye </indig> doctor <indig> jo hai
kafi bade acche kisam ki </indig> education <indig> ke prapt karnewale hain
</indig>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#118:1:A>
No <w> we've </w> the best doctors in the world

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#119:1:A>
I mean everbody <{> <[> accept that </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#120:1:B>
<[> And <w> they've </w> </[> </{> been trained I think in
conditions <,> which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to
function <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#121:1:B>
<w> They've </w> a family to live <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#122:1:B>
<w> They've </w> some kind of education of children and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#123:1:B>
Since <w> they're </w> exceptionally gifted uh professionals <,>
been given a good course of education <,> there is some reluctance <,> in a
part of them to go to rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#124:1:B>
A large number of things have been done by government

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#125:1:B>
We have <,> allowances <w> we've </w> incentives <,> <w> we've
</w> created houses <,> quarters and so on as part of the <}> <-> <.> pri
</.> </-> <=> primary </=> </}> health infrastructure scheme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#126:1:B>
I think gradually <,> as development increases excess increase of
his own system increased <,> doctors are in fact available <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#127:1:B>
Mind you <,> may I also say this <,> that as against about four
lakhs of doctors <,> three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system
<,> <w> there're </w> about four lakhs of wise render <,> <indig> hakims
</indig> and so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#128:1:B>
They are already available in the rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#129:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> not as if the rural areas is totally without any
medical help <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#130:1:B>
But allopathic modern system of medicine <,> with a backup of
dispensaries and drug etcetera <,> is spreading <,> perhaps <,> somewhat
slowly

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#131:1:A>
Mr Srinivasan one other question

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#132:1:A>
This is regarding the availability of medicines <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#133:1:A>
<indig> Hum ne dekha hai ke nakli dawayiaan <,> bazaar mein bahut
bikti hai </indig>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#134:1:A>
Now what is the position <,> what <w> you're </w> doing to control
this <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#135:1:B>
<indig> Saheb </indig> you see <,> you know <w> it's </w>
very difficult question to answer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#136:1:B>
First of all prescription vary <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#137:1:B>
There are cases where <indig> nakli dawayiaan asal mein </indig>
definite <indig> asal mei hai </indig> if I may say so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#138:1:B>
But <,> <indig> bahut si jagah pe </indig> what you say is <indig>
nakli dawayee </indig> <,> is in fact <indig> dawayee </indig> which tested
by efficacy test <,> does not measure up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#139:1:B>
Tested by bio availability test is not measured up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#140:1:B>
It is not uh totally <,> uh a kind of <,> uh <w> it's it's </w>
misleading in <w> it's </w> effect

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#141:1:B>
It claims more than it does <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#142:1:B>
The reason for that is <,> the quality of good manufacturing <,,>
that have to go into this is improving slowly <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#143:1:B>
But again please don't lose the perspective <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#144:1:B>
We produce about three thousand <indig> crores </indig> worth of
medicine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#145:1:B>
<O> Two words </O> I think <,> a good part of it comes from large
industries <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#146:1:B>
Good part of it comes from well run small industry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#147:1:B>
I would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#148:1:B>
But <,> yeah there are <,> black sheep <,> and the only way to do
it is to have drug regulatory action <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#149:1:B>
Now drug regulatory action has to be within the law <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#150:1:B>
So we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#151:1:B>
What is more important or more acute <,> consumer consciousness
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#152:1:A>
You mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis
<,> the present priorities on health care in rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#153:1:A>
<w> What're </w> the new concepts and technologies and this will
be my last question <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#154:1:B>
Yeah

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#155:1:B>
But you see <,> technology wise <,> certainly the <,,> early
detection <,> has an approach

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#156:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#157:1:B>
Take cancer for instance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#158:1:B>
Cancer of the breast <,> cancer of the cervic for women <,> oral
cancer for men <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#159:1:B>
I think <w> it's </w> possible to have lot more of education given
<,> to people <,> to school teachers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#160:1:B>
So that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by
themselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#161:1:B>
What is it that requires treatment <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#162:1:B>
And <w> it's </w> now clear for instance in cancer if you detect
early <,> you can get it completely cured <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#163:1:B>
Take for instance oral health and dental health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#164:1:B>
As a country we wash a lot <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#165:1:B>
Inspite of that our oral health is declining <,> <w> it's </w>
possible for us <,> uh to get <,> so technology is going to be <,> not
tremendously different from what is known <,> but health education <,>
involvement of people <,> getting people to look after the health <,> is part
of the primary health approach <,> would be the main issue

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#166:1:A>
Mr Secretary <,> will we have health for all by two thousand
<,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-041#167:1:B>
<w> It's </w> very broad question and what do we mean <,>
certainly <w> we'll </w> have much creative control over disease <,> some
diseases definitely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#168:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> have much creative effective immunization of
children against preventable diseases <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#169:1:B>
We would have I hope much greater positive awareness of health <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-041#170:1:B>
And my own personal feeling is <,> I hope that people would be
encouraged <,> to take care of their own health <,> and medicine would stand
<,> somewhat demystified
