For many amateur photographers the use of zoom lenses to enhance
the effects of their photographic skills may still seem far-fetched and too
complicated.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#7:1>
In this lucid article, S. Thiagaranjan, director of Indian Institute
of Photography, Madurai gives some tips on how to use a zoom lens. </p> </&>

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#8:1>
<bold> Z</bold>oom lenses were originally developed for motion
pictures and T.V. cameras.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#9:1>
It has now been adapted for still cameras, especially for 35 mm SLRs.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#10:1>
Zoom lenses are of complicated construction that allow some of its
elements to the moved in relation to others, whereas in fixed focal length
lenses the arrangements are critical.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#11:1>
With increased sharpness in optics designing and added <quote>
" macro" </quote> features most people use zoom lenses to the exclusion of
FFL lenses.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#12:1>
In shooting colour transparencies especially, zoom lenses have an
edge over the FFL.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#13:1>
One can frame the picture exactly as he wishes and this is a great
help as there is no scope of subsequent making down as in a print film.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#14:1>
There is a psychological factor in zoom lens, expecially with colour.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#15:1>
Also they are economical of time, saving the user while changing from
lens to lens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#16:1>
Within its own limit zoom lens offers inifinitely variable focal
length. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#17:1>
Focal length by focal length and image for image there is loss of
quality in zoom lenses compared to FFL lenses.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#18:1>
Perhaps this may not be significant.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#19:1>
Of course modern technology is improving the quality and hence
even the hardened antagonists are switching over to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#20:1>
For 35 mm SLRs zoom range is normally 1:3 or 1:4 and slowly
higher ratio zooms are coming to the market.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#21:1>
But compared to short range zooms these are not getting image quality
in their entire range, consistent with the prices offered for them.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#22:1>
The ideal zoom lens depends on <w> one's </w> requirement.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#23:1>
While function photographers prefer 35-105 zoom, nature <w>
photographer's </w> choice is 80-200 or even higher.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#24:1>
While short focal lengths like 24 mm are very expensive, long ones of
200 and above need a tripod for use.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#25:1>
Viewed from different aspects, possessing two zooms - - 28-80 and
80-200 will satisfy most of the needs and fall within a reasonable budget.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#26:1>
The need for a normal lens is obviated.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#27:1>
The still longer focal length lenses are weighty with a maximum
aperture of f / 4.5 only.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#28:1>
Also the comparatively flimsy front panel of a camera will not
bear the burden of such weighty lenses and cause possible damage and
distortion and do not justify the work they are occasionally called to do.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#29:1>
Unless one specialises in a particular field where such very long
focal lengths are a must, they do not justify the investment thereof. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#30:1>
There are two types of zoom lenses, helical and rectilinear.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#31:1>
In the former one has to focus by one ring and change the focal
length ( zoom) with another ring.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#32:1>
In the rectilinear both are combined; a twist for the focus and
push-pull for zooming.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#33:1>
This one control is normally preferred by many.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#34:1>
However there is one unnoticed snag in this as the lens is zoomed out
/ zoomed in, after the initial focus there may be accidental change in focus.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#35:1>
<h> <bold> Some useful tips </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#36:1>
1. A good rule for zooming is to focus for the long and shoot
short.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#37:1>
Setting the longest focal helps in <quote> ` focussing accuracy'
</quote> since one gets the biggest possible image and the minimum depth of
field.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#38:1>
Another advantage is metering the backlighted subjects.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#39:1>
The fighter angle of the longest zooming works like a selective
focussing and spot reading the exposure.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#40:1>
After long set focussing and light metering, set the memory lock
in automatic cameras to that exposure setting and then zoom to the frame
area wanted and shoot. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#41:1>
2. From the same position explore all the possible ranges in
<O> <&> page ( not printed) </&> 21 </O> zooming, from the shortest to the
longest.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#42:1>
Each position will give different pictorial effect.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#43:1>
Just try and physically <quote> ` see' </quote> in each situation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#44:1>
Surprisingly new possibilities in viewing will be discovered. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#45:1>
3. In the single control lens one can push-pull to change the
local length and so the image size.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#46:1>
But one must be careful in not disturbing the focus in this
operation.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#47:1>
Also in some zoom lenses the outer tube is not tight enough and
slowly slips from the position, especially when the camera is mounted
slightly inclined on a tripod.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#48:1>
A rubber band helps to check this. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#49:1>
4. For hand held shooting, to avoid camera shake, the maxim is
<O> photograph occupying the rest of the page </O> <O> <&> Tantalizer 1 </&>
</O> <O> photograph on second column </O> to have the focal length in use as
the minimum shutter speed and adjust the aperture suitably for the exposure
required.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#50:1>
In the zoom lens one remembers only the shorter focal length and
uses lower shutter speeds.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#51:1>
Even though one may be using it must of the time switching over to
higher shutter speeds for higher focal lengths is forgotten. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#52:1>
5. It is better to avoid using filters on zoom lenses as far as
possible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#53:1>
6. Regarding use of lens hoods over zooms bear this in mind-in
long focus an improper hood is likely to vignette and it will be visible in
the film though not in the screen.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#54:1>
Due to the f stop set <O> <&> page ( not printed) </&> 22 </O> the
hood may also come under focus while clicking.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#55:1>
Zoom hood should be short enough for shorter focal length, but these
are not effective for long focal length.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#56:1>
So the hood must be such that it can also be push-pulled along with
the zooming of the lens, otherwise the problem of vignetting creeps in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#57:1>
7. While holding the camera, use the smaller ratio ( of object -
image size) of 1:3 or 1:4 for macro zooming this is easier.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#58:1>
First set the reproduction ratio on the lens and then focus by moving
the whole camera and lens as a total unit and then fine focus. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#59:1>
8. There are two ways of <quote> ` Macro Zooming' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#60:1>
Use the special <quote> ` Macro' </quote> setting at short focal
length and shoot.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#61:1>
This will permit only a short distance from the object too short for
effective lighting on it.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#62:1>
There is no <quote> ` zooming' </quote> as such in this mode.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#63:1>
Perhaps there may be some special effects. </p> <&> Tantalizer 2 </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#64:1>
But if a close up supplementary lens is mounted on the zoom lens,
a different way of <quote> ` macro' </quote> ing can be done.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#65:1>
Here the zoom control also can be manipulated and in fact a higher
macro ratio is got. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#66:1>
The intervening space between the lens and the object is also
greater to give better lighting for the subject. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#67:1>
9. With converters the speed of the zoom lens becomes slower and
the aperture marked on the barrel is no longer valid.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#68:1>
To find the new EL and f stop for any converter, multiply both the
values by the power of the converter.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#69:1>
For instance, a 2X converter on 80mm zoom with f / 2 becomes 160mm at
f / 4.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#70:1>
With TTL metering the extra exposure is generally compensated and
there is no need to reset for the meter reading.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#71:1>
But when a non-TTL flash is used the f stop marked on the lens has to
be recalculatred to avoid under exposure:

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#72:1>
Also, converters generally begin to give better results at 1 stop
below the minimum.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#73:1>
Thus, a 2X converter on 135 mm / 1.4 lens makes it as 270 mm / 2.8
lens.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#74:1>
In this good quality, pictures can be had from f / 4 or beyond.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#75:1>
Better per formance is claimed for <quote> " matched" </quote>
teleconverters offered by some camera and lens manufacturers.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#76:1>
They are said to be specially corrected particularly well with
certain lenses as specified by each maker. </p> <&> column two. page no. 22,

<h> <bold> Three Dimension Cards & Flickers </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#85:2>
Every one is now-a-days familiar with the colourful foot rulers,
in which the pictures change as one turns the foot rule.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#86:2>
Some such flickers even show movements like movie cartoons.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#87:2>
Some cards contain pictures which appears 3-D i.e. having length,
breadth and thickness.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#88:2>
The <quote> " Winking lady" </quote> , which was recently very
popular can be cited as its example. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#89:2>
Here is an attempt to explain how one can make such flickers and
3-D cards photographically, in <w> one's </w> own darkroom.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#90:2>
Though the plastic screen, with vertical lines etched on it
technically called a <quote> " lenticular screen" </quote> is not easily
available in India, however such cards can be made with ordinary line screens
printed on lith film. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#91:2>
<h> <bold> FLICKERS: </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#92:2>
Flickers in its crude forms are available as play things for
children.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#93:2>
In these pictures an animal is seen as if in a cage with parallel
thick bars.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#94:2>
As soon as the bars are slid, a second animal appears in its place.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#95:2>
Photographically these pictures can be made as follows: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#96:2>
Draw rectangle 3" X 4" on a thick ( Black drawing paper ) paper
4" x 5" in size.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#97:2>
On this draw vertical lines lengthwise at say 0.1 inch distance.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#98:2>
There will be 41 such lines.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#99:2>
Cut all these vertical lines carefully with a blade.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#100:2>
Thus there will be forty ( 40) bars in the rectangle touching
each other.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#101:2>
Cut each alternate bar, and make a cage.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#102:2>
What we may say makes the front of the cage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#103:2>
Now choose two negatives that are going to form the pictures
that replace each other.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#104:2>
These picutures are than printed on one and the same paper.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#105:2>
First the screen with bars ( cage ) is placed on the enlarging
paper while exposing picture <quote> " A" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#106:2>
This picture will only be exposed to the gaps int he bars.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#107:2>
Now shift the screen carefully through one bar and expose the second
negative ( B).

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#108:2>
After developing and fixing and drying the two pictures will be seen
in alternate vertical strips ( 1/10 inch long and 4 inch high ) , making all
a mess. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#109:2>
If the screen is now placed on this messy picture, the parts (
cage ) of one picture say <quote> " A" </quote> will be covered and
picture <quote> " B" </quote> will be seen as a whole picture by illusion.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#110:2>
On moving the screen through one bar picture <quote> " B" </quote>
will be covered and picture <quote> " A" </quote> will be seen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#111:2>
Two pictures are printed side by side, by this very method.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#112:2>
But this time the screen is not with 10 lines per inch but with 40
to 60 lines per inch. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#113:2>
It is not possible to cut such a fine stencil on a paper.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#114:2>
Hence a screen is taken when 60 verticle lines are printed per inch.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#115:2>
The width of the black line must be equal to the width of the
transparent line.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#116:2>
Such a screen is called a Roster. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#117:2>
Two pictures are now printed on one and the same paper as above.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#118:2>
Expose picture <quote> " A" </quote> through the Roster.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#119:2>
The paper is exposed only through the transparent parts of Roster.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#120:2>
Shift the screen through one line only, so that the black lines
cover the exposed parts and transparent parts are on the unexposed paper.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#121:2>
Expose picture <quote> " B" </quote> and develop the paper - both
the pictures are now printed in alternate vertical lines.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#122:2>
One may not be able to see any picture clearly.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#123:2>
They are jumbled up.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#124:2>
It is difficult to move the roster through exactly one line on the
exposed paper.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#125:2>
Ways are therefore to be found to achieve this without mistake.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#126:2>
Here is one way: </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#127:2>
Take two rosters and fix them on the base board with cellotape
on two sides of the sensitive paper ( try on dummy paper) like two doors.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#128:2>
However, the doors when closed shall overlap each other, in such a
manner that the lines of one shall fall on the transparent part of the other,
i.e. when over lapped, the paper should not be seen. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#129:2>
When every thing is ready for enlarging, fix the Bromide
paper with pieces of cellotape to the base board ( between these two
rosters).

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#130:2>
Cover the paper with the left hand roster and expose picture
<quote> " A" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#131:2>
Then remove the left hand side roster.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#132:2>
Now put right hand side roster on the paper and expose ( after
inserting the second negative in the enlarger ) picture <quote> " B" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#133:2>
After developing and fixing you will get the jumbled up picture.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2D-019#134:2>
Paste this jumbled up picture on a stiff base - - say box board
- - then fix one roster to a glass ( plate stick boarder only with
stick-o-fast ) .

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#135:2>
If now this glass plate ( 1 mm thickness ) with roster is placed
on the picture ( Roster down is in contact with the picture ) - - only one of
the two pictures will be seen giving illusion of a clear picture.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#136:2>
On moving the roster through one line the other picture will be
seen.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#137:2>
Thus this will resemble the change - - a picture in a cage, through
cage bars.

<ICE-IND:W2D-019#138:2>
If now the glass plate with roster is placed on the jumbled picture
so that the roster is on top, i.e. about 1 mm away from the jubled picture a
flicker will result, i.e. on tilting the combination each picture will
alternately be seen giving you a flicker picture. </p> <O> <&> page ( not
