Doctors in a New Delhi hospital will now find it easy to treat
patients of arthritis and kidney failure <,> and myasthenia gravis <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#112:1:B>
This is a new process that removes the disease causing agents from

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#113:1:B>
Our correspondent has more details for you <,,> <X>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X114:1:B>
Doctors claim they can treat patients of severe lever and kidney
failure <,> arthritis myasthenia gravis and even poisoning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X115:1:B>
The process is called the <?> plasma therisis </?> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X116:1:B>
It filters out and discards a protein in the blood <,> that
becomes infected with disease causing agents <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X117:1:B>
This protein is called <mention> globunil </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X118:1:B>
All the <w> patients' </w> blood is brought into this machine
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X119:1:B>
In the first stage a filter separates the watery plasma of the
blood from the solid red blood cells <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X120:1:B>
The red cells are stored and will be returned to the patients
body <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X121:1:B>
The plasma contains the disease causing globunil <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X122:1:B>
So this plasma is taken to another filter <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X123:1:B>
This filter separates the globulils from the plasma <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X124:1:B>
The infected globulils is collected into a bottle and will be
discarded <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-008#X125:1:B>
