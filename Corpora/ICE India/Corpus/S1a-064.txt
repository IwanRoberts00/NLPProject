<ICE-IND:S1A-064#1:1:A>
Hello <,> I am Usha <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#2:1:B>
And I am Rukmini <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#3:1:A>
Say <,> tell whatever you want <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#4:1:B>
You <{> <[> studied </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#5:1:A>
<[> Studied have </[> </{> you studied for <w> tomorrow's </w>
paper <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#6:1:B>
Oh no I have to <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#7:1:A>
And don't talk anything about the teachers <,,> because
professor Patil will be reading about it <,,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#8:1:A>
I am scared about grammar <,> what about you <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#9:1:B>
I am scared about linguistics <,> because we have to be very
specific while writing the <,> answers we have to study the definitions and
all that <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#10:1:A>
And I think grammar is worst <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#11:1:B>
But grammar we can apply what we have studied to something

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#12:1:A>
Yeah but suppose we mistake <,> in the class

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#13:1:B>
I will oppose <,> we will make mistakes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#14:1:A>
We will make mistakes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#15:1:B>
However we try good shot

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#16:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what I am scared of <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#17:1:A>
What are you planning to do after you go to Hyderabad <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#18:1:B>
After going there <,> actually I didn't want to go <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#19:1:B>
They will force me to go <,> and after going there I have to go to
the <,,> <O> two words </O> school <,,> and attend that uh <,> youth
parliament <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#20:1:A>
How many days is the <,> <{> <[> two days <,,> Parliament

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#21:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#22:1:A>
<{> <[> Two days </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#23:1:B>
<[> Two days </[> </{> <,> July first and second <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#24:1:A>
And you booked your uh <,,> ticket from uh Hyderabad to <O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#25:1:B>
Bangalore <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#26:1:A>
Bangalore <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#27:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#29:1:A>
Fifth of July <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#30:1:B>
Fifth of July <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#31:1:A>
And your girl <,> daughter <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#32:1:B>
My girl is there in Bangalore <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#33:1:B>
My husband is there <{> <[> mother is there </[> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#34:1:A>

So other day all of us will leave from Bangalore on fourth <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#36:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#37:1:B>
Fourth evening <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#38:1:A>
And uh <,> then you can't take leave <indig> na </indig> <,>
once you join there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#39:1:B>
Yeah <,> I cannot <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#40:1:A>
I must say <,> in one way I am quite happy to go back to
school but then <,> everything will start all at once <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#41:1:B>
And uh <{> <[> we cannot </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#42:1:A>
<[> House activities </[> </{> and teaching <,,> tests <,> you
can't even take leave <,> exact

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#43:1:B>
And once we start we cannot uh <,> no question of stopping in
<{> <[> between also </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#44:1:A>
<[> No question of stop </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#45:1:A>
I thought actually that I would take some days off and <,> take a
holiday but <w> it's </w> just not possible you know with <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#46:1:B>
And uh what about your <,,> uh that official order regarding
the <,,> consideration of this

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#47:1:A>
No I don't have any such letter as yet <,,> for the time being
I am only given a letter saying these three days <,> you know twenty-seven
twenty-eight twenty-nine <,> <w> I'll </w> be considered on duty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#48:1:A>
But it seems Neeta has <,> Nivedita has uh <,> <{> <[> letter </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#49:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> she has got a copy <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> of
her letter

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#50:1:B>
Please pass it on <,> because I have got one copy <,> uh this Uma
wanted it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#51:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#52:1:A>
Yeah I know <,> even <w> I'll </w> send

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#53:1:A>
It is the same letter we got at Hyderabad

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#54:1:B>
Yeah Hyderabad <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#55:1:A>
Oh then I have given a copy of that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#56:1:B>
This Geeta had given it to me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#57:1:A>
Yeah yeah got it <,> I had given a copy of that to school <,>
but uh they have to get clarification about that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#58:1:B>
Who <,> who has to get

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#59:1:A>
The school authorities <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#60:1:B>
Yeah actually what happened <{> <[> was that in my case </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#61:1:A>
<[> Because that letter to me </[> </{> <w> it's </w> <?> true
</?> copy

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#62:1:B>
Yeah in my case what happened know <,> they send this to the
Assistant Commissioner <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#63:1:B>
And then a letter come from that Assistant Commissioner saying that
<,> uh so many days can be treated as <{> <[> on duty </[> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#64:1:A>
<[> On duty </[> </{> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#65:1:A>
So you will be given <,> earned leave <{> <[> accordingly </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#66:1:B>
<[> Earned leave </[> </{> yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#67:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what uh <,> even our principal wants to find
out <,> but I think they won't find out <w> we'll </w> have to go back and
set out <,,> start the whole thing <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#68:1:B>
So he is not uh <,> he will not <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#69:1:A>
No no <,> I mean she is not refusing

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#70:1:B>
Uhm <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#71:1:A>
But uh <,> she won't write to the Assistant Commissioner <{1>
<[1> you know </[1> I mean <{2> <[2> unless I remind </[2> her <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#72:1:B>
<[1> Why why </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#73:1:B>
<[2> I think <w> she's </w> will do </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#74:1:A>
She will do it unless <,> only if I remind her <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#75:1:B>
How is she <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#76:1:A>
She is okay <,,> I mean <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#77:1:A>
No I tell you she rang me I mean know she has sent a letter <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#78:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#79:1:A>
<{> <[> To </[> my house <,> and I was supposed to go on the
sixteenth <,,> and it was for eleventh standard admission <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#80:1:A>
Oh god <,,> I tell you <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#81:1:B>
<[> Uh ha </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#82:1:B>
Now what about the twelfth standard results <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#83:1:A>
God knows I don't have any idea <,> about school result

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#84:1:A>
I haven't been to school <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#85:1:B>
I heard that in our shool <,,> the highest was eighty-four
percent <,> the highest rank <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#86:1:A>
But uh <{> <[> how did you </[> get the news <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#87:1:A>
Oh letter

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#88:1:B>
<[> <O> Two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#89:1:B>
Not letter <,> before I came here no I went to our <w>
prinicpal's </w> place and we had got the information from somewhere else

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#90:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#91:1:B>
Like that I came to know <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#92:1:A>
Because <,> I haven't botherd to ring up school <,> and uh <,>
secondly there is nobody staying near my house <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#93:1:A>
Still I had asked Savita <indig> na </indig> her son is in our
school eleventh satandard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#94:1:A>
Now in twelfth <,> he he could find out from the neighbours and all
<,> but our <O> one word </O> must have forgotten also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#95:1:A>
Everybody so worried about the exams and studies <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#96:1:B>
Now today <{> <[> Grace </[> madam has aksed us to write that
uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#97:1:A>
<[> Go back </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#98:1:A>
Oh yeah <,> oh god <,> that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#99:1:B>
In about uh the <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#100:1:A>
We had suggested actually about practice teaching <,> to <,>
our teachers only we had suggested that <,> that they should have you know
first of all <,> some sort of a syllabus even for that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#101:1:A>
And the two teachers who teach <,> should <,> preferably teach as
a pair <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#102:1:A>
That is you know you start off a topic I continue and complete it
or something

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#103:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#104:1:A>
Instead of like one doing <,,> composition and other doing
poetry and thing like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#105:1:A>
Certainly you can write that again in hour <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#106:1:B>
Uh what <{> <[> day </[> uh <,> told was we talked about this
to Julka madam <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#107:1:A>
<[> Study </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#108:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#109:1:B>
And then uh <,> she was telling that uh <,,> this kind of a
thing <,> would actually limit the scope of a teacher <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#110:1:B>
Like if we prescribe a syllabus <,> we will have to adhere to the
syllabus and so we cannot uh <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#111:1:A>
True <,> but see they are not very happy when we do poetry
<,> or prose

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#112:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#113:1:A>
Isn't it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#114:1:A>
So why not <.> nea </.> completely eliminate that all together
<,,> because <,> one side you also have to see the learners <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#115:1:A>
They have come for some particular course <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#116:1:B>
Yeah <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#117:1:A>
And you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you
<,> find conveninent <,> and then <,> plus the tutors are going to turn
around and say that <,> of what use was this <,> to the learner

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#118:1:B>
And at the same <,> no <w> that's </w> what she told when uh
<,> a question was raised like this last time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#119:1:B>
I think others uh <,> proficiency classes by the faculty members
<,> uhm it was started just <,> uh two years back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#120:1:B>
<w> It's </w> because of this <,,> some other participant they
complained about this <,> and uh then they started <,> <O> one word </O> they
started this particular <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#121:1:A>
Method

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#122:1:B>
Uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#123:1:A>
Because such a <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#124:1:B>
So <w> they'll </w> benefit out of the faculty teaching

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#125:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#126:1:B>
And notes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#127:1:A>
But even that is not fair no <w> it's </w> like we use them
for one hour as guinea pigs

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#128:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#129:1:A>
Only for one hour they are taught by <,,> the other
professors <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#130:1:B>
No this way what will happen is we could try out new
techniques <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#131:1:B>
Otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#132:1:B>
Say we would uh <,> get other variety <,> you know like <,>
writing skills there are so many you can teach them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#133:1:B>
And you may take up speaking skills listening skills <,> I think
that area is big enough <,> yeah no <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#134:1:A>
Areas <{> <[> which have not been touched upon till now </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#135:1:B>
<[> <w> It's </w> not really as for <O> two words </O> </[>
</{> yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#136:1:A>
You could easily do it <,> and that one month would really
help them <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#137:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not only one month <,> <w> it's </w> a three
week course which they have <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#138:1:A>
And it will also give us the chance to try out new methods
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#139:1:B>
Uh I am not very sure how many will go back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#140:1:B>
Even means like I try out some methods <,> but with the time
problem <,> always over there <,> you can't always have <,> all kinds of new
methods to do <O> cough </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#141:1:B>
So may be <,,> then secondly again like we had talked abot having
only one practice teaching instead of two <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#142:1:A>
It seems before they had three

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#143:1:B>
Yeah I know that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#144:1:A>
And Julka <w> ma'am </w> was telling that they were lucky
because they could take the best two <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#145:1:B>
Best two <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#146:1:A>
Now here <,> <.> bu </.> but when we told that here we have
to take only one

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#147:1:B>
They should take <,> but they are not doing that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#148:1:A>
They they are not doing that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#149:1:B>
They want to combine both <,> and keep on the average

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#150:1:A>
And people like me who got the first chance do you know it is
really difficult for us <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#151:1:B>
Uhn <,> <w> that's </w> true <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#152:1:A>
No no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#153:1:B>
No then I think they could you know <,> either start the
course a little earlier <,> and give us say three four days to get used to
the idea <,,> or because though they send you material saying you must get
ready for your lesson <,> when you don't know the learners <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#154:1:A>
I know

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#155:1:B>
How <{> <[> will they prepare </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#156:1:A>
<[> And not only that </[> </{> they have told that they will
help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#157:1:A>
But here after having come here I don't think uh <{> <[> there was
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#158:1:B>
<[> Nothing was available </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#159:1:B>
The <{> <[> library was not available </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#160:1:A>
<[> Uhn library uhn </[> </{> library facility was not there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#161:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a big draw back <,> and specially Jaikar is
quite a good library <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#162:1:B>
So I think we should have had the chance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#163:1:B>
Though how much reading we would have done is <}> <-> anybody </->
<+> <w> anybody's </w> </+> </}> guess

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#164:1:A>
Yeah <w> that's </w> what uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#165:1:B>
Again classes <,> bit too long I feel <,> five <w> O'clock
</w> is tiring <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#166:1:A>
And what happens when special classes are taken in between

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#167:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#168:1:A>
Some two to three

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#169:1:B>
Three and all <O> one word </O> <,,> very sad thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#226:1:A>
She is Rama Matthew

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#227:1:B>
I met her <,> at Hyderabad in December when we went for this
uh <,,> the <{> <[> R P training </[> she had come over

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#228:1:A>
<[> <O> Two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#229:1:B>
It seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is
some <{> <[> something <O> one word </O> you </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#230:1:A>
<[> No but its not </[> </{> compulsory <,> only if you <{>
<[> want you can come </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#231:1:B>
<[> No <w> it's </w> not compulsory </[> </{> but <,> I would
like to go definitely <,> <{> <[> but then </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#232:1:A>
<[> I told </[> </{> her <,> I will be in Hydrebad till
second then she told you stay back for five more days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#233:1:A>
I told <w> that's </w> very difficult from <,> seventh May I have
been travelling

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#234:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#235:1:A>
<w> It's </w> really very difficult <,> I am sorry <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#236:1:A>
She told okay <,> <w> it's </w> okay uh any way you have done this
much <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#237:1:B>
I didn't do much you know <,> I only did two uh <.> ob </.>
uh observations

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#238:1:A>
You sent the second one <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#239:1:B>
I sent both <,> yeah both I sent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#240:1:B>
But I couldn't observe any uh <,> old class change <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#241:1:A>
Uh even I <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#242:1:B>
It isn't possible only the new nine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#243:1:B>
And <,> our school is also not so near to any other school you
know <,> and with <,> the main problem is that board exam is on my head <,>
so what happens is I cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other
schools <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#244:1:B>
But like this year if <,> I have to do it <,> I will try to be a
little bit more systematic <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#245:1:B>
Secondly more time <,> that we came to know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#246:1:A>
So this year there will be tenth standard observation also
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#247:1:B>
For the new tenth

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#248:1:A>
For the new

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#249:1:B>
And the new nineth

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#250:1:A>
She told the materials will be sent by the <,> end of July

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#251:1:B>
Uhm <,> no <w> that's </w> okay because you get August
September that time it came very late <,> by <{> <[> the time I got that it
was settled </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#252:1:A>
<[> I got that even got that <O> two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#253:1:A>
Even I got in the third week

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#254:1:B>
Because no <.> pro </.> point in doing that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#255:1:A>
And by the time all the students had left for the study leave
and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#256:1:B>
All sorts of things yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#257:1:A>
So I wrote a letter immediately saying that <,> I will not be
there

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#258:1:B>
And when I sent mine I also wrote a letter saying this
problem is there <,> and the two observation that also the first observation
I did in rough <,> thinking I wouldn't be able to manage but it was okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#259:1:B>
So I sent it in rough with my report <,> set up and uh second one
of course I did <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-064#260:1:B>
And you get the xerox uh done after <,> sheet observation sheet
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#261:1:A>
No no no

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-064#262:1:B>
Then </I>
