<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#1:1:A>
Well alternatively we also have the <w> women's </w> long jump
<,> at the other end but we shift our attention <,> to the <w> men's </w>
eight hundred metres <,,> all is set now <,,> and uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#2:1:B>
Just look out for that man in the full black <,,> William Tanui
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#3:1:B>
If Natalia <,> Dukhnova <,,> uh went full ahead after the first lap
in full red <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#4:1:B>
This time it is William Tanui <,> in full black

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#5:1:B>
But mind you <,> there are five Kenyans in this race

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#6:1:B>
You really can't say <,> about these Kenyans <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#7:1:B>
They just run and run <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#8:1:B>
There goes the start <,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#9:1:B>
The first hundred <,,> on the track and then shifting it by <,> when
you cut into <,> the first lane <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#10:1:B>
William Tanui <,> in third position at the moment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#11:1:B>
Two Kenyans in the track <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#12:1:B>
But looks like Vincent Malakawen <,> and Henry Lebo <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#13:1:B>
But running very easily <,> is William Tanui the man in full black
<,,> <&> applause </&> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#14:1:B>
You see that old bunch of there <,> and here is Avtaar Singh coming
in there on your screen <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#15:1:B>
First is the Kenyan <&> interruption </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#16:1:B>
Now look in second position William Tanui <,,> <&> interruption
</&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#17:1:B>
Here is they all running crowded <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#18:1:B>
Now that is William Tanui now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#19:1:B>
Two hundred metres <?> free </?> row <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#20:1:B>
Another Kenyan in the front <w> let's </w> see now <,,> whether <w>
it's </w> going to be <,> like Kiptanui <,,> who was beaten but this time <,>
William Tanui <,,> still there <,,> <&> applaud </&> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#21:1:B>
Oh the great fight between three Kenyan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#22:1:B>
William Tanui has fallen behind <,,> and another one has come
through <,> at number one one two <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#23:1:B>
Robert Kibbet of Kenya <,,> was a surprise winner here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#24:1:B>
So as uh <,> they say in Kenya one runner after another comes
through <,,> so here is another champion coming <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#25:1:B>
Now look at this Robert Kibbet coming from behind <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#26:1:B>
He was in third position <,> and <,> he stretch right through <,>
and went on <,,> to first position <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#27:1:B>
William Tanui <,> came in too late <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#28:1:B>
He did manage to come through <,> to second position <,> but Kibbet
had made <,> the break through at the right moment <,> and thus <,,> Robert
Kibbet the winner <,> of the eight hundred metres <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#29:1:A>
But you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it John ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#30:1:B>
Oh yeah <w> it's </w> because <,,> uh they keep saying in the
interview last evening <,> both this uh <,> uh Kip Tanui and <,> William
Tanui <,> that you can never say in Kenya <,> who can win and who can't <,>
today and who can win tomorrow <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#31:1:A>
Well <w> that's </w> the stuff that the Kenyans are made up of
<,,> and there they are the three of them <,,> acknowledging the greetings
from uh this very hospitable crowd here in Pune <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#32:1:A>
I think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good
<,,> and I think uh <,> John this has been the best race of the day so far
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#33:1:B>
Yes this was a very good race because uh <,> he came right
from the outside and came in <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#34:1:A>
Well what is it that uh makes the Kenyans uh <,> keep on
clicking in these races <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#35:1:B>
Now <,> <&> recording broken </&>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#36:1:C>
Well <w> it's </w> going to be Steve Watt continue <,> from
the score board end <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#37:1:B>
<w> Men's </w> javeline uh <,,> as we welcome you viewers uh
<,,> back <,> to the Shiv Chhattrapati Sports Complex <,,> and here is <,,>
Vladimir Dubrovschik <,,> he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight
zero metres <,> and <w> he's </w> really gone mad <,> because <,> he
obviously has <,,> shown he can be a discus <,> to the best stretch <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#38:1:A>
Well John I think <w> he's </w> happy because <w> that's </w>
what happened <,,> he won <,> look likes the discus edging out <,> the hot
favourite Jurgen Schultz of Germany <,,> and over the last ten to fifteen
minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#39:1:A>
<w> He's </w> taken out two or three <,> of his T-shirts and given
them away to the crowd <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#40:1:A>
And the joy is written clearly all over his face and body <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#41:1:A>
For a man of his stature <,,> top as he is now <,,> he is doing the
laugh of honour <,,> Vladimir Dubrovschik of the Ukraine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#42:1:A>
And what a happy moment this is for him <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#43:1:A>
Well the Germans have been a <,,> great favourite in the discus but
uh <,,> <w> it's </w> uh an upset for uh <,> the Germans here <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#44:1:A>
Jurgen Schultz <,,> beaten by his own game <,> Toto of mix <O> one
word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#45:1:A>
And that that will be victory ceremony for the <w> men's </w> long
jump

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#46:1:A>
The winner <,,> once more a Chinese Lan Jong of China <,,> clearing
seven point eight two metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#47:1:A>
So the Chines uh <,,> bringing a few surprises John <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#48:1:A>
In second spot Vladimir <,,> <?> Maleiwind </?> of Turkmenistan <,>
seven point seven seven metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#49:1:A>
And uh taking the bronze uh <,,> the jumper from Oman <,> Ahmed <,>
Obed Bashir <,,> seven point four five metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#50:1:A>
So the uh Chinese uh <,,> continuing with the success story here at
the <,> Shri Shiv Chattrapati Sports City <,,> winning one more gold medal
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#51:1:A>
And uh <w> that's </w> the finish of the <w> women's </w> fifteen
hundred metres <,,> which uh <,,> ended in victory for the Irish girl Sonia
<w> O'Sullivan </w> <,,> the hot favourite for this event as John describe
earlier on <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#52:1:B>
Yeah Sonia <w> O'Sullivan </w> has <,,> has gone to win <,>
but I would like to <,,> after <,,> since she has is in the way to winning
streak at the moment <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#53:1:B>
And you can see what a lovely play she <,,> over through to Roja
Kutty <,> and then third to run <,> and of course <O> two words </O> she was
the only challenger for her <,> and she kept away <,> <O> two words </O> as
well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#54:1:B>
That was the <w> women's </w> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#55:1:A>
Seven of them in contention <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#56:1:A>
Three from India <,,> Jagjit Singh <,,> <?> Tony </?> Verghese and
uh <,> Satbir Singh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#57:1:A>
The uh <,> national record is in the name of Satbir Singh
seventy-five point two two

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#58:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> pick up action in the <w> women's </w> uh <,> uh
long jump <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#59:1:A>
Elena <?> Govorou </?> of Ukraine <,,> <w> she's </w> on your
screen now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#60:1:A>
The uh <,,> <w> women's </w> uh long jump record the uh <,> meet
record in the name of Lalita Brednaya of Russia <,> six point eight nine

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#61:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> get back to <w> men's </w> juveline again <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#62:1:A>
Two of the field events uh <,,> going on at uh the same time <,> at
different parts of the ground <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#63:1:A>
The <w> women's </w> uh <,,> long jump and uh <,,> the <w> men's
</w> juveline <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#64:1:A>
Well we coming on late <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#65:1:B>
The other meet is coming on now <,> first will be the B wing
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#66:1:B>
And then we come on straight Carl Lewis <,,> Emmanuel Tuffour of
Ghana <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#67:1:A>
Well while we are at the <w> men's </w> juveline <,,> uh we
and uh while we <,> did describe about Merelene Ottey holding on to uh <,,>
the <w> women's </w> two hundred metres <,> where uh <,> it was expected from
her <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#68:1:A>
There has been an upset in <w> men's </w> discus which we announced
earlier on <,> and uh <,> the winner there <,> the official result having
come in <,> is uh Vladimir <,> Dubrovschik <,,> in eight metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#69:1:A>
And uh <,,> he upset the apple cart <,> with uh Nick Winnie of
Irelend finishing second <,> sixty-one point nine two <,> and uh the German
the world record holder Jurgen Schultz <,> uh in third spot sixty-one point
three eight <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#70:1:A>
So on a day when Merelene Ottey John <,> held on to <,> the
expected title Jurgen Schultz has lost out

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#71:1:B>
Jurgen Schultz uh <,> did say <,> but he was not in the best
streak of the moment <,> and he was not throwing <,> the seventy-four which
he felt <,> when he set the world record in nineteen <,,> eighty-seven <,>
but uh he himself <,> did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point
zero eight <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#72:1:B>
And even convinced I beleive <,> for the judges were lying when
they said that that was the world record <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#73:1:B>
But Jurgen Schultz as I said earlier <,> is alternating <,> between
<,> grip practices for <,> the discus throw and also <,> in his sports
promotion business <,> because as he said I want <,> to get money <,> because
uh <,> he doesn't make as much money <,> as the Carl Lewis or Sir Jack <?>
Whooker </?> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#74:1:A>
Well John uh the action is now centred at uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#75:1:B>
The hundred metre

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#76:1:A>
<w> That's </w> right <,> the blue ribband of uh <,,> all
athletic races <,> and the name which is uh <,,> going to be there where all
eyes are going to be focused <,> is uh the <,,> eight times Olympic gold
medal winner <,> and uh the same time that he won the world championship <,>
uh Carlson Fredrick Lewis better known to all of us as <,> Carl Lewis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#77:1:A>
He is uh drawn in the <,> second of the <,> uh <w> men's </w> one
hundred metres <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#78:1:A>
The uh <,> <{> <[> You have <,> Permit meet record <,> for the
hundred metres in the name of uh Thomas Jefferson <,> another fine U S
athlete <,> set way back in nineteen eighty-nine <,> ten point two zero <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#79:1:A>
And uh the Indian record in the name of R <,> uh Gyanshekaran <,>
uh ten point six zero <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#80:1:B>
<[> You have </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#81:1:B>
Now in the first hundred metres which is schedule for now <,>
you have two Oman runners <,> and in lane <,,> three you have Gurvinder Singh
<,> of India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#82:1:B>
Now these <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#83:1:B>
And I was telling you uh you have <,,> two runners from Oman <,,>
in this first <,,> three hundred metres race <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#84:1:B>
And these Oman runners <,> are <,,> good uh for <,> the four
hundred eight hundred fifteen hundred <,> but uh these days uh <,> in the
Middle East we are having some of the best best coaches from abroad <,> to
push their talent <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#85:1:B>
But you could expect uh <,> some of these boys <,> to do well <,>
in uh the Asian Games <,> at Hiroshima <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#86:1:B>
This uh first race in the hundred metres of course <,> will be uh
<,> just uh <,> a teaser for you <,> because in the next one <,> comes Carl
Lewis Patrick Stevens Emmanuel Tuffour <,> Donald and Sherry <,> all great
sprinters <,> today on the grand Prix circuit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#87:1:B>
Patrick Stevens of Belgium <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#88:1:A>
Well John if you remember uh <,,> uh there can always be an
upset if you remember one of the first <,,> but uh beaten by a lesser known
<.> Austr </.> <{> <[> Austria </[> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#89:1:B>
<[> <.> Aust </.> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#90:1:B>
As uh <,> I as Carl himself said <,> <quote> I know that the
contest is going to be very good </quote> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#91:1:B>
And this boy from Ghana <,> Emmanuel Tuffour running in lane five
<,> for <,> that kick <,,> ten <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#92:1:B>
And here is the victory ceremony for <,> the eight hundred metres

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#93:1:B>
You have Shiny Wilson <,> the <,,> the former record holder for the
event which she <,> lost when Jyoti Mohit Sikdar set the new record <,> at
<,> the European circuit <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#94:1:A>
Well there is the winner of the <w> women's </w> eight hundred
metres <,,> Natalia Dukhnova of uh <,> Belarus <,,> two minutes zero two
point one zero second <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#95:1:A>
And what a fine run she had <,> sporting the uh <,> very famous
sunglasses <,,> uh which has now become a part of International sport <,>
whether <w> it's </w> athletics <,> football or cricket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#96:1:A>
Shiny Wilson uh <,,> second with two minutes O two point three two
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#97:1:A>
And uh Shiny gets a <,,> a warm kiss from uh <,> the one who
finished first in the race <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#98:1:A>
And <w> that's </w> the bronze medal winner <,> uh Cydesen Karen of
Denmark <,> the Dane winning uh <,> coming in third spot <,> two minutes O
seven point three one second <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#99:1:B>
All squad there in fact everybody thinking <,> as Gurvinder
Singh in the screen <,> from India <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#100:1:B>
He is one <,> of the <,> upcoming hundred metres runners <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#101:1:A>
John and this reminds us of uh the man who lit the <,> flame
today <,> uh the man who held his national <,> record and the title for a
long long time <,> Adil Somadiwala isn't it ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#102:1:B>
Yeah <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#103:1:A>
We have a Chinese <,,> in lane five <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#104:1:B>
Now <w> let's </w> see what this <,,> Chinese man is going to
do <,,> because already <,> the Chinese have shown <,,> even with the very
few that have come out to <,> Pune here <,,> that uh they have some good
stuff in their country <,> even present uh <,> well uh <,> they are going to
do or not uh <,> well uh <,,> I mean uh they have not got of course the best
from out there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#105:1:B>
But even those that have come here <,> have done well <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#106:1:A>
John the Americans have all these uh health way in the <,>
hundred metres strength for <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#107:1:B>
Yes of course <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#108:1:A>
You see <,> has come in <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#109:1:B>
And of course <,> uh everybody has read that uh Dimple
Christly incidently <,> is <,> also from Jamaica but now <,> uh <,,> is uh
settled in <,> England <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#110:1:B>
And a good <O> one word </O> citizen today <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#111:1:A>
And another name which we can't forget is Baleri Bourgoef
with one hundred and two hundred <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#112:1:B>
Yeah <,,> the only Russian to <,> be a sprinter which gone
<,> who has become immortal <,> because he came out at the time when the
American <,> were in full sway <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#113:1:A>
Rajiv Balakrishnan from India <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#114:1:A>
He is running in the hundred metres here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#115:1:B>
Rajiv Balakrishnan is not on the list of runners <,> but uh
<,> he is doing the hundred metres free race <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#116:1:B>
And <w> let's </w> see <,> if he <,> he could come in because he
is training more for the two hundred metres <,,> because uh if <,> the Indian
team goes to <,> Hiroshima then Rajiv Balakrishnan <,> will run both the <.>
fou </.> hundred four hundred metres relay <,> as well as the four hundred
metres uh <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#117:1:B>
So <w> let's </w> see if he can win <,,> this the hundred metres
free race uh <,> in the National games here <,,> <&> interruption </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#118:1:B>
<w> That's </w> one <,> close start Rajiv Balakrishnan <,,> and
<w> that's </w> Gurvinder Singh in your <,,> feature screen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#119:1:B>
The Chinese there <,,> also <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#120:1:A>
John and the tension <,> <{> <[> Lying <,> <w> it's </w> not
only on the athletes but everyone out here as well <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#121:1:B>
<[> Lying </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#122:1:B>
Yeah the hundred metre is always does that to everybody <,,>
because that is the race everybody looks ahead to <,> and uh <,> of course
that is <,,> a day of great spectacle <,> in any athletic meeting <,>
anywhere in the world <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#123:1:B>
There is another Chinese <,> in the second hundred metres race as
well <,> and that is that tall person <,> standing behind <,> in second lane
<,> waiting for his <,> trial to come over <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#124:1:B>
And the Chinese in the first year <,> in this race <,,> you can
see in lane two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#125:1:B>
<w> That's </w> Merlene Ottey is here <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#126:1:B>
Sweet talking to the sports men of Slovak Vasnaik <,,> <&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#127:1:A>
It looks like the Chinese in the front <,,> here is the great
fight between <,> Korea yes it is <,> looks like that the Chinese <,> China
athlete who has won <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#128:1:A>
And he did it so nicely <,> one hundred and ten <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#129:1:B>
Strangely enough his name is not on the list <,> of
competitors

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#130:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-014#131:1:B>
That was Rajiv Balkrishnan in the blue shorts <,> one seven
five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#132:1:B>
And here is the replay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#133:1:B>
On the first lane is uh <,> <?> Al Maksai Saidewoma </?> <,,> and
the Chinese runner down in the middle <,,> with Gurvinder Singh <,>
struggling there to keep in the forefront <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-014#134:1:B>
And look at the end as the Chinese runner surges ahead <,,> </I>
