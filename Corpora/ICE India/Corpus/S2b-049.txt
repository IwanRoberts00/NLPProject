<ICE-IND:S2B-049#1:1:A>
I am extremely grateful to the Executive Committee of the  
Indian Association <,,> for American studies <,> and to my fellow delegates  
<,,> for electing me to preside over the twenty-seventh annual conference  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#2:1:A>
As the President of the <mention> I A A S </mention> <,> I deem it  
my previlege <,> to welcome you all <,,> distinguished guests from India and  
abroad <,,> delegates <,,> members <,> fellow academics from the Goa  
University <,,> ladies and gentleman <,> to the twenty-seventh annual  
conference <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#3:1:A>
American studies in India <,,> had a chequered growth during the  
last forty-five years <,,> as Indo-U S relations constantly <,> came under  
the clouds <,,> caused by the stresses and strains <,> of international cold  
war <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#4:1:A>
American studies in a systematic way <,,> leaving it mainly to the  
American funding <,,> uh funding agencies or the binational agencies like the  
<mention> USEFI </mention> and the <mention> A S R C </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#5:1:A>
However Indian policy makers <,,> have not thought it <,,> necessary  
do their own bit <,> to promote American study <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#6:1:A>
A facile reason sometimes offered for American studies not being  
considered <,> as an area of study is that it does not require <,> study of a  
foreign language <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#7:1:A>
Thus in India and America <,,> uh thus India and America are  
separated by common language <,,> English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#8:1:A>
Hence outside the J N U <,> I doubt whether there is any University  
in India <,> which has a full fledged centre for study of America <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#9:1:A>
In University of Bombay for instance <,> American studies were  
sought to be introduced <,,> in the early <,> <}> <-> ninety-sixties </-> <+>  
nineteen-sixties </- > </}> <,> with the help of University of Pennsylvania  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#10:1:A>
But the conventional <,> departmental boundary <,,> was so strong  
<,,> that Readers <,,> recruited to study America got scattered <,> amongst  
the department of history <,> politics <,> and literature <,> rather than  
remain as one unit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#11:1:A>
But since then one person specialising on America in each  
department <,,> has not even grown into two <,,> contrary to <w> Parkinson's  
</w> Law <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#12:1:A>
This is in contrast to study of the erstwhile Soviet Union <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#13:1:A>
What the Indian Americanist have <}> <-> offer </-> <=> often </=>  
</}> <,> encountered instead <,> is a charge of being a C I A agent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#14:1:A>
However whenever any discussion has taken place on the question of  
increasing contact <,,> between the Indian scholars and their American  
counterparts <,,> obviously on the American initiative <,> our educational  
bureaucrats <,,> have not hesitated to plead <,> that they too be included in  
the academic exchange programme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#15:1:A>
Be that as it may <,,> <w> I've </w> always tried to find answers  
to the question <,,> why study the U S <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#16:1:A>
Be its politics <,,> or history or literature or culture or  
civilisation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#17:1:A>
There are many reasons <,> which could be advanced to answer the  
question <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#18:1:A>
One vital reason <,,> is that <,,> the U S today has emerged as the  
only veto weilding <,,> major power in the United Nation <,> with a will  
power to commit <,,> its superior military strength for the <,,> collective  
good albeit as it sees it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#19:1:A>
To learn about the U S therefore is to remove our own ignorance  
<,,> so as to enable us to make our policies more effective <,> in achieving  
their goals <,,> uh their goals <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#20:1:A>
Such ignorance galored in our <,> general public <,> and policy  
makers <,> including law makers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#21:1:A>
Public ignorance <,,> deserves to be eliminated <,> but its impact  
on our bilateral relations is indirect <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#22:1:A>
But ignorance on the part of policy maker can cause avoidable harm  
to the friendly relations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#23:1:A>
To give one example very few of our policy makers are aware <,,> of  
the fact that <,> a segmented governmental structure in the U S <,,> cannot  
always act <,,> or speak without cacophony <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#24:1:A>
Thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators <,,> along  
with a very low level state departmental official met some Sikh separatist  
outside the committees home <,,> the Indian <w> MP's </w> created an uproar  
<,> alleging the U S government interference in our internal affairs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#25:1:A>
Another reason is that <,,> as a developed political system <,>  
with a continous history of two hundred and sixteen years <,,> I <,,> feel  
that <,,> the U S can offer us some insight <,> as to how to organise <,,>  
our ever evolving political system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#26:1:A>
This is true of our <,> literature <,,> to <,> to some extent <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#27:1:A>
Most of those who have contributed <,,> a great deal to creative  
work in our regional language <,> uh language literature <,> like Marathi or  
Kannada <,> have themselves been teachers of English <,> or more specifically  
<,> American literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#28:1:A>
If I do not venture to mention <,> some names of such creative  
writers <,> it is for the simple reason <,> that I do not wish to generate  
<,> a controversy from those who are left out <,> as well as those included  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#29:1:A>
In the area <,,> of comparative political systems <,,> where I can  
claim some expertise <,> I wish to submit that we can <,,> search for some  
answers <,,> for our own political problems <,> from the American political  
system <,> and experience <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#30:1:A>
There is nothing wrong if we look at the American political system  
for answers to our own problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#31:1:A>
As the American political <,> experience has given to mankind <,>  
certain unique political concepts <,,> to organise sharing of political power  
like federalism <,> and presidential system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#32:1:A>
The countries of South Asian region for instance <,,> look to our  
democratic political experience <,,> to develop their own democratic  
institutions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#33:1:A>
Today India as an ancient society <,,> attempting to build a modern  
political system <,> is facing three major challenges <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#34:1:A>
First communalisation of politics second <,,> political instability  
<,> and third as a consequence of the first two challenges <,,> a threat to  
national unity <,> and integrity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#35:1:A>
As India has faced many challenges in the past and somehow <,,>  
managed to survive <,> there is a false complacency that we could overcome  
<,> present challenges as well <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#36:1:A>
But it is my considered opinion <,,> that we are sitting on the tip  
of a volcano <,,> and it might errupt anytime <,,> if corrective steps are  
not taken <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#37:1:A>
Hence before these challenges go out of control <,> I strongly feel  
that we need to switch over <,> to uh a presidential system of government  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#38:1:A>
Tinkering with the existing parliamentary system won't help us  
anymore <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#39:1:A>
Presidential government need not be a copy of the American system  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#40:1:A>
But <}> <-> <.> bio </.> </-> <=> by </=> </}> borrowing essential  
from American system <,> and applying modifications to suit changed times <,>  
our major political problems can be brought under control <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#41:1:A>
India is a multi-regional <,> multi- linguistic and multi-religious  
society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#42:1:A>
This diversity and this uh <,,> hetrogenity <,> our founding  
fathers tried to hold together <,> in a parliamentary system within a federal  
structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#43:1:A>
This was <,> imitative of the British parliamentary system <,,> as  
introduced by the Government of India Act nineteen thirty-five <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#44:1:A>
This is unlike the American experience <,,> after their  
independence from the British colonialism <,,> Americans though familiar with  
the British parliamentary system <,> created a unique system of presidential  
government <,> within a federal structure to hold together <,> their  
hetrogenous population <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#45:1:A>
The parliamentary system can function well only when <,,> there is  
a two party system <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#46:1:A>
In a more homogenous society as in Britain <,,> Parliamentary  
system add political instability <,> whenever the Labour Party <,> face  
splits as in nineteen twenty-four and nineteen twenty-nine <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#47:1:A>
Basic problem with the parliamentary democracy in India <,> is one  
of our failure to develop <,> two or three national political parties <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#48:1:A>
With the Indian National Congress inheriting the mantle of glory of  
freedom struggle <,> the congress party enjoyed one party dominions  
nationally <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#49:1:A>
But by nineteen sixty-seven <,> there were clear signs that All  
India National Congress <,> was loosing its national character <,> and  
emerging as only vote catching <,> and power sharing device <,> <-> in the uh  
<,> device </-> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#50:1:A>
In the process <,,> the congress developed a pluralistic <,,>  
political majority in different states by putting together <,> dominant caste  
and uh <,> minority community based on <,> coalitions like KHAM Kshatriya  
Harijans Adivasis and Muslims <,> in Gujrat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#51:1:A>
The <,> system of appealing for voters <,,> selecting candidates  
<,> appointing <,,> man to <,> executive positions on caste and communal uh  
<,,> basis is the congress strategy to begin with <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#52:1:A>
This was only vulgarised by V P Singh in his uh <,,> effort to  
develop an alternative to the congress <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#53:1:A>
He started with uh <,> MAJGAR <,> Muslims Ahirs <,,> Jath Gurjars  
and uh Rajputs coalitions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#54:1:A>
And later tried to expand it by adding the O B C <,> by announcing  
the acceptance of uh <,> recommendations of Mandal <,> now uh <,,> Mandal  
Commission <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#55:1:A>
The B J P answered <,> it by taking up Mandir Masjid issue <,> and  
trying to bring together highly pluralistic Hindus <,> under their political  
banner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#56:1:A>
Today <,,> all political parties from the left to the right are  
basically communal <,> as once asserted by <,> former <,> Justice Krishna  
Iyyer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#57:1:A>
Why this communalisation of political process <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#58:1:A>
It is mainly <,,> because in the parliamentary system an M P <,>  
who aspires to lead the <,,> nation as the Prime Minister must command a  
sizable following <,> within the party to be the leader of the legislature  
party <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#59:1:A>
To do so Indian leaders have found it easy to appeal <,> on caste  
and communal basis <,> and present themselves as protectors of one <,> or the  
other section of the community <,> instead of developing issues <,> uh issue  
and programme based party <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#60:1:A>
In this kind of caste and community based politics <,,> power  
sharing <,,> blatantly <,,> come to uh blatantly has come to be on the <.>  
bas </.> same basis as the stunt of the caste <,,> or community in the  
parliament <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#61:1:A>
As a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding  
loyalties <,> on a communal basis than <-> to the </-> <,> to be a part <,>  
of issue based political party <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#62:1:A>
When uh <,,> too many parties get elected <,,> forming a stable  
government becomes difficult <,> and a coalition or a minority government <,>  
becomes inevitable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#63:1:A>
But from the caste or communal angle <,> a cabinet post in a  
coalition <,> is assured to a caste oriented party <,> rather than when the  
particular caste or community <,> follows the national issue based party <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#64:1:A>
This has tended to fragment Indian political parties <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#65:1:A>
Thus inspite of the Congress and Janata Dal <,> and others wooing  
scheduled castes <,,> they have found it necessary to found their own party  
<,> Bahujan Samaj <,> Party in U P as Jaths from western U P have come <,>  
out from the Janata Dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#66:1:A>
Today there are thirty-three political parties <,> all fractions in  
<.> Lo </.> <,> in the <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#67:1:A>
While the first <indig> Lok Sabha </indig> after fifty-two election  
<,> had only five political parties <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#68:1:A>
In the process <,,> no political party has been able to get a  
rolling majority after nineteen eighty-four elections <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#69:1:A>
So long this trend of appealing for votes and post on caste and  
communal basis continues <,> fragmentation of political parties is bound to  
continue <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#70:1:A>
The result of communalisation of electoral politics <,,> <-> has  
been political </-> has been uh <,> political <,,> instability both at the  
states <,> and at the centre <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#71:1:A>
Instability in state is not a new phenomenon <,> but political  
instability at the centre <,> is a new phenomenon particularly under the  
Congress party <,> dispensation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#72:1:A>
What has brought this thing at the centre <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#73:1:A>
Clearly the absence of a ruling family <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#74:1:A>
Mrs Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi <,> <O> cough </O> tried to maintain  
their individual control over the party <,,> and the government <,,> through  
the iron rule of political instability <,> uh political destabilisation of  
individual Chief Ministers <,> in the Congress party ruled state <,> whenever  
they showed any <O> one word </O> to independant action <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#75:1:A>
Since the end of the Nehru-Gandhi family rule <,,> the centre has  
seen <,,> political instability as well as uh <,> as well on a day to day  
base <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#76:1:A>
It is politics all the way <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#77:1:A>
Hence the government has no time to govern <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#78:1:A>
If in the past non congress efforts to form the government <,> at  
the centre have invariably ended in the political uh in the vertical splits  
in the ruling party <,,> Janata Party in nineteen seventy-nine and the Janata  
Dal in nineteen ninety <,> whether the congress party can avoid it <,> is not  
cleared today <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#79:1:A>
In contrast to this <,,> American presidential system has been able  
to provide <,> a reasonable degree of political stability <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#80:1:A>
Reasonable because <,,> after constitution imposed a two term <,>  
on presidential aspirants <,,> after Franklin D Roosevelt was elected for a  
fourth term <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#81:1:A>
Only two <,> Eisenhover and Reagan where able to complete eight  
years in the office <,> as against it <,> seven presidents were in the White  
House for less than two terms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#82:1:A>
It still <,> appears reasonable stability <,> when we note that  
Carter in his four year term <,> dealt with three Indian Prime Ministers <,>  
and Bush in <,> four year saw four Indian Prime Ministers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#83:1:A>
This stability <,> this uh <,> stability in the American system <,>  
is based on the principle <,> of the separation of powers <,> between the  
executive and legislative branches <,> which has made President co-ordinate  
and independant <,> with Congress in respect of term <,> powers <,> functions  
<,> and <O> one word </O> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-049#84:1:A>
President thus enjoys a fixed tenure <,,> and cannot be removed by  
the Congress except through impeachment <,> which is extremely difficult and  
rare <,,> </I>
