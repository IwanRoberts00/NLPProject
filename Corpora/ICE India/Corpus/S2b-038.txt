<ICE-IND:S2B-038#1:1:A>
Conversation with Dr Uma Chakravarty we <}> <-> have </-> <=> have
</=> </}> been trying to understand how history shaped <,> by the selective
interpretation of past events <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#2:1:A>
This particularly has affected the representation of women in history
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#3:1:A>
In part one of the series Dr Chakravarty discussed the inherent biases
in historical sources <,> looking particularly at women in <,> the Vedic and
Buddhist periods <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#4:1:A>
In the second part we went on to look at women in mythology and the
epics <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#5:1:A>
In the third we discussed the Bhakti tradition and <,> the Medieval
period <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#6:1:A>
Today in our concluding session we would look at the representation of
women at the turn of the century and soon after <,,> </&>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#7:1:A>
Now uh coming to the nineteenth century <,> and the
Socio-religious Reform Movements that we see at that time <,> uh would you
like to comment on the context in which <,> suddenly <- > we </-> <,> so
called woman question acquires prominence <,> suddenly woman question is
foregrounded <,> what is the context in which this happen <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#8:1:B>
Well actually this is uh <,> this is the question and this is
an area which is <.> com </.> <,> tied up completely with our uh <,> the the
rewriting of history <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#9:1:B>
Uh the enterprise of uh <,> writing history <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#10:1:B>
Uh what you get in the nineteenth century is a <,,> uh a rather
dramatic confrontation <,> between <,> two different <,> cultures <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#11:1:B>
Uh with what appears to be a visible difference <,> <-> in way </->
in which the <,> colonial power <,> uh structured its gender relations and
the way in which the uh <,> the colonised power <,> uh had structured its
gender relations

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#12:1:B>
And this is not a confrontation <,> which is on an equilitarian
basis but on clearly on an unequal basis <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#13:1:B>
So what you get is uh <,> the British <,> as the conquerors <,,> uh
<,,> with their understanding of both of their own culture as well as of the
culture that they are <,> now uh exposed to <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#14:1:B>
And the uh Indians who were reacting to <,> uh a certain kind of
construction of their culture being <,> uh made by the colonial power <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#15:1:B>
Now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at
this in two ways <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#16:1:B>
One is to discuss what they consider to be a uhm <,> you know the
<,,> the positive <,,> values of this <,> the culture that they had come into
confrontation with <,> and a certain kind of uh uh <,> recognition that this
was <,> uh an ancient culture with various defined rules and <,> so on <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#17:1:B>
And this more or less uhm <,> coincided with the orientalist
enterprise

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#18:1:B>
That is the orientalists <,> who <,> you know uhm translated the
sanskrit text who <,> uh who collected works <,> who uh uhm you know
discovered new works and so on

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#19:1:B>
And so there was a <,> certain understanding about the past which
began to be constructed

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#20:1:B>
But it was done clearly from the point of view of the <,> uh of the
British who <,,> needed to know these uh <,> all these <,> in terms of being
better administrators <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#21:1:B>
Simultaneously there was a <,> fairly strong and noticeable
reaction by the British <,> uh which ended up in <,> <-> in in </-> a sense
condemning <,> the culture that they had uhm uh come into <,> uh contact with

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#22:1:B>
And this is done partly because uh it also would indicate the moral
superiority of the conquerors and the <,> and the legitimacy of their
enterprise

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#23:1:B>
But at the same time it also ended up in uh <,> making sweeping
condemnations of the entire culture

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#24:1:B>
Now what happened during this period is to begin to <,> identify
the status of women <,> with the civilisation as uh <,> it it became the <,>
uh index <,> of a civilisation <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#25:1:B>
So the status of women <,> uh would then decide whether the
civilisation was <.> ha </.> something that was valuable or not <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#26:1:B>
And this is what happened during the nineteenth century

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#27:1:B>
Now <,> it also tied in with the <,> the understanding of a how one
needed to reform the structure of relation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#28:1:B>
Uh <,> what practice is needed to be <,> uh stamped out <,> or uh
what kind of changes needed to be introduced <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#29:1:B>
And uh <,> here again there were two different ways in which you
can look at it

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#30:1:B>
<-> There was </-> <,> there was the British <,> uh view point <,>
there was also uh <,> development from within the <,> uh Indians <,> which
was also similarly interested in certain degree of reform <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#31:1:B>
There was for example a woman like Pandita Ramabai who was
writing <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#32:1:C>
Uh <,> a little later uhm <,> little later but <,> early on
for instance in the early uhm <,,> nineteenth century you have some <,> uh
<,> say the whole discussion of <indig> sati </indig> <,,> and the need to
legislate on <indig> sati </indig> <,> bringing forth the kind of literature
that Rajaram Mohan Roy <,> and his adversaries generated on the <w> women's
</w> question

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#33:1:C>
And here <,> here the <w> women's </w> question became central <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#34:1:C>
Because uh you and and the use of the text also became central
because it was important to try and <,> establish <,> that several traditions
were authentic certain were <,> certain traditions had been interpolated

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#35:1:C>
So the reformers used the <indig> Shastras </indig> <,> to indicate
that <,> uh certain practices were not there in the ancient hoary past

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#36:1:C>
This is the period in which the beginnings of the Vedic <,> the
construction of the Vedic uh <,> period as a golden age for women actually
<,> began

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#37:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#38:1:C>
Uh because it was important to try and say that at some point
in the <,> hoary past uh the status of women had been high

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#39:1:C>
That certain aberrations developed <,> and that these needed to be
stamped out <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#40:1:C>
Uh at the same time the adversaries also used the <indig> Shastras
</indig> <,,> to state that <,> the uh <,> the practices were actually
indigenous they were an inherent part of <,> Indian tradition

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#41:1:C>
All this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh
<,> generated <,> or about the past <,> in in which a lot of people were <}>
<-> <.> into </.> uh </-> <=> involved </=> </}> <,> uhm <,> and <}> <-> <.>
la </.> </-> <=> later </=> </}> <,> the nationalist came into the fray and
they needed <,> again to reconstruct the past along the lines that they
wanted

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#42:1:C>
And they did this with a particular point from a particular point
of view <,> because they restructured gender relations <,> but they also <}>
<-> restructure </-> <=> restructured </=> </}> the images of men and women
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#43:1:C>
Means they created a uh uh a kind of <,> a <,> new man <,> who <,>
was vigorous <,> who was uh dynamic who was not at all a an effete person <,>
which is how the Britisher cast <,> Indians <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#44:1:C>
Uh uh effete <,> emasculated kind of person <,> but someone who was
<,> uhm was strong <w> who've </w> <w> who's </w> marshall who was <,> who
was capable of uh <,> the highest courage <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#45:1:C>
And the Vedic period died after that because the Aryan <,> uh was a
militant marshall <,> uh person <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#46:1:C>
Simultaneously they did this <,> the same thing for women <,> so
women <,,> got developed in two ways <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#47:1:C>
Uh one was to look at women from the point of view of the uh uh <,>
practices that they had <}> <-> <.> be </.> </-> <=> been </=> </}> familiar
with

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#48:1:C>
So Gargi for instance and the episode of Gargi <,> becomes very
very important at this time <,> one to say that women <-> had </-> should
have access to learning now <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#49:1:C>
And there was a debate raging on whether women should study or not
<,,> in Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#50:1:C>
At the same time <,> uh it did indicate <,,> the status in their
minds of women in the past <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#51:1:C>
And so one would get for instance a certain half baked half
information

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#52:1:C>
For instance Gargi <,> the Gargi narrative <-> was </-> always used
to say <,> that Gargi was learned she could debate Yagnavalka but they didn't
complete the story

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#53:1:C>
And they wouldn't tell you that <,> uh the debate had been on uhm
<,> unfair grounds and had been terminated on unfair grounds

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#54:1:C>
That when <,> uh Gargi <,> uhm fixed <,> uhm Yagnavalka with two
subtle questions which <,> he would not be able to handle <,> and which he
was not able to handle he simply said <,> uhm </quote> shut up woman
otherwise your head will fall off </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#55:1:C>
And uh he <,> ended the debate on that note

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#56:1:C>
Now <,> the nationalist obviously could not bring the later part
<,,> because this would be a reflection on their ancient past <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#57:1:C>
But <,> in any case this kind of enterprise went on

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#58:1:C>
Simultaneously they also highlighted uh <,> a certain <indig>
kshtriya </indig> values for women <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#59:1:C>
And so they created new kind of men and a new kind of <}> <-> <.>
wo </.> </-> <=> womam </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#60:1:C>
Now <,> Ramabai <,> uh interestingly didn't quite fit in with this
whole reconstruction of the past <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#61:1:C>
Uh <w> Ramabai's </w> was unusual because she was one of the few
women who <,,> knew Sanskrit had been taught Sanskrit by her father <,> uh in
fact by her mother <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#62:1:C>
Uh who <,> then studied the the text <,,> and who obviously was not
satisfied with the kind of answer that she found in her <,> text <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#63:1:C>
So that Ramabai became a little bit of an embarassment <,> to <,>
the uhm <,,> to atleast one section of the nationalist not to all of them

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#64:1:C>
Now Ramabai is is extremely important from our point of view

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#65:1:C>
Because if you if we were to say <,> <w> who's who's </w> one uh
<,> one of the first <,> uh women to be perceptive about the uh <,> status of
women <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#66:1:C>
Uh one of the first <,> investigator as it were into the past as
well as into the present would be Ramabai

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#67:1:C>
She travelled extensively <,> but uh <,> during <O> one word </O>
she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh <,> evokes this in the
text that she wrote which is called the <mention> High Caste Hindu Widow
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#68:1:C>
Now here she talks about the low status of women <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#69:1:C>
And she is <,> really interesting because she turns the arguments
of this both the uhm <,,> English <,> and the nationalist in a sense a
section of the nationalist <,> uh wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#70:1:C>
Now whereas people had <,> judged the <,> uh index of civilisation
<,> by the <,> low status of women and this is what the British had done <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#71:1:C>
Uh simultaneously someone like Dayananda had turned it around and
he talked about the status of women being high in the Vedic period and
therefore this in <,> civilisation being <,> uh fine

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#72:1:C>
Ramabai <,> actually talks about psychological fear <,> and she
says <,> that <+> the </+> reason why we are a subject nation is because if
women are subject how can they produce sons <,> who are not psychologically
uh cowards <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#73:1:C>
And so she turns the argument fully around

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#74:1:C>
Now <,> hers is a really fascinating enterprise uh she uh <,> was
both reformist as well as knowledgable <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#75:1:C>
And uh <,> her handling of the <w> women's </w> question has a kind
of sharpness <,> and it it extraordinarily moving I mean uh for instance <,>
uhm <,> there is this marvellous passage that she had on the uh <,>
completely unequal uh <,,> relations between men and women

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#76:1:C>
So she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow <,> and
the situation which obtains to a widower

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#77:1:C>
And she uses Manu

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#78:1:C>
She says <quote> Let her <}> <-> </.> emi <.> </-> <=> emaciate
</=> </}> her body by living on pure flowers <,,> roots and fruits but she
must never ever mentioned the name of another man <,> after her husband has
died <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#79:1:C>
Until death let her be patient of hardships <,> self-control and
chaste </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#80:1:C>
Then she goes on and she says <,> <quote> The rules for the widower
<,> a twice born man <,> versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of the
equal <,> caste <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#81:1:C>
And <,> having at the funeral given sacred fires to his wife who
dies before him <,> he may marry again <,> and again kindle the <O> one word
</O> fires </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#82:1:C>
And the way she juxtoposes the two <,> you know indicates the
directness with which she is confronting the problem

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#83:1:C>
Here are a set of rules for men <,> here are the certain <,>
certain set of rules for women

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#84:1:C>
And the uh <,> double standard of morality something that she
exposes <,> marvelously

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#85:1:C>
She does this as far as uh <,> infanticide uh <,> she in a sense
she is one of the first recorders of <,> statistics because she talks about
female infanticide <,> and so on

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#86:1:C>
So <,> her experience is actually uh <,> quite unique and is
something that <,,> historians all historians <,> uh should this you know
should <,> open themselves upto

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#87:1:C>
But certainly she is very important for rewriting history <,> to
include women <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#88:1:B>
Uh <,> in in an early conversation with you you had mentioned
that Dayanand Saraswati has some very interesting things to say about women
as mothers <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> would you like to talk about that ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#89:1:C>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-038#90:1:C>
Yes sure

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#91:1:C>
Uh <,> well <,> you know uhm <,> Dayanand goes back to the Vedas
for uh <,> for uhm <,,> a lot of the <,> uh kind of practices that he would
now <-> write </-> like to bring back <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#92:1:C>
So he <,> he gives to women a very central role <,> in uh creating
a new race of heroes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#93:1:C>
Now in doing this he is able to simultaneously deal with the <,> uh
women as wife <,> but also deal with the widow <,> who <}> <-> is a </-> <=>
is a </=> </}> problem in nineteenth century and who is an embarassment to
many of the reformers

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#94:1:C>
He <,> uh brings back and he talks about the practice of <indig>
niyoga </indig> <,,> which is very interesting because <indig> niyoga
</indig> uh <,> in the vedic time had been <,> the possibilities of uh <,> uh
rearing a son for the dead husband <,> uh by appointing somebody else in his
place <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#95:1:C>
Now this is a practice and uh <,> lot has been made of <indig>
niyoga </indig> <,> as a positive <,> right that women had

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#96:1:C>
But uh uh <,> in the Vedic period <w> let's </w> not make any uhm
<,> <w> let's </w> not confuse the issue uh <,> it remains a prerogative uh
<,> which is available to the kinsmen of the household <,> to ensure that
reproduction <,> uh is uh continues

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#97:1:C>
<w> It's it's </w> the right to remarry or to <,> co-habit but <,>
under rules which uh which previleged men and the cultural norms that they
would like to perpetuate

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#98:1:C>
Now <,> Dayanand <,> uses this <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#99:1:C>
And he suggests that uh <,> that uh <,> widows can use <indig>
niyoga </indig> <,> to have a series of son

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#100:1:C>
So he does that on the one the hand <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#101:1:C>
But he also because of concern is very strongly for a a new race
<,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#102:1:C>
For a race of people who are strong and rigorous <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#103:1:C>
He uses the biological <,,> power of women <,> uh and regulates
<,,> for it <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#104:1:C>
Now for instance he suggests that women <,,> uh must not uh <,>
actually feed their own <,> children because these should be handed to a
wetnurse <,> because a woman should return to uh uhm <,> as quickly as
possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is <,>
best equipped for it which is between the years of sixteen and say <,> thirty
or whatever or whatever which will <,> which is the best time from the point
of view of reproduction

<ICE-IND:S2B-038#105:1:C>
So he uhm <,> he uses both <,> traditional knowledge as well as
medical knowledge to uh <,,> propose a <,> set of rules which does at one
level apparently raised the status of women <,> but which in in a sense
actually it is seeing women as stock breeders </I>
