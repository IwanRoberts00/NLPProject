<ICE-IND:S1B-048#1:1:A>
This morning we have with us <,,> Mahasveta Devi <,> the
eminent Bengali writer visiting Delhi <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#2:1:A>
Mahasveta Devi was born in Dhaka which is now in Bangladesh <,> and
pursued her academic career in <mention> Vishwabharati <,> Shantiniketan
</mention> and also <,> later in the Calcutta University

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#3:1:A>
Interestingly she did her <,> M A in English literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#4:1:A>
Mahasveta Devi is a social activist <,> a journalist <,> and a
vibrant creative writer

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#5:1:A>
She has taught <,,> at school and college level English literature
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#6:1:A>
Also she has been a roving reporter of two Bengali dailies <,,>
<mention> Vartuman </mention> <,> and <mention> Yugantur </mention> mainly
reporting on the matters related to villages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#7:1:A>
She is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences
because she has garner them <,> from the different areas of life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#8:1:A>
It is interesting to know for us <,> that she has also worked in the
Telegraph and Postal Department of India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#9:1:A>
She has been working <,> <&> clears throat </&> with the <indig>
adivasis </indig> of India <,> working with them <,> and <,> they are in
Orissa Bihar and Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#10:1:A>
Presently she is concentrating more <,,> in Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#11:1:A>
And she draws her inspiration and authentic power <,> that comes
from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived
and the <,> neglected <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#12:1:A>
She has to her credit forty-two novels <,,> sixteen books of
collected short stories <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#13:1:A>
A book of plays <,,> amongst which we can <,> very happily name the
<,> uh <mention> <indig> Hazar <w> Chaurasia's </w> Maa </indig> </mention>
five books for children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#14:1:A>
She has also received several medals

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#15:1:A>
And <,> it is a big list to go through but let me mention the
<mention> <indig> Amrita Puraskaar <,> Jagataruni </indig> Medal <,> <indig>
Nikhil Bharat Bang Sahitya Puraskaar <,> Bhuvan Mohini </indig> Medal
</mention> and also <indig> <mention> Padmashree </mention> </indig> in
nineteen eighty-six <,> for her <,,> excellent work <,> with the <indig>
adivasis </indig> <,> of India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#16:1:A>
Her works have been translated in <,> <indig> Malyali <,> Gujarati
<,> Hindi <,> Telugu <,> Tamil </indig> <,> and certainly in English <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#17:1:A>
And <w> I'm </w> very happy to tell you <,> as far as I know <,>
her books are used <,> in several universities <,> in Australia and the
United States <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#18:1:A>
Mahasveta Devi <,> it is great pleasure <,> to have this
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always <,> enjoyed that
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours <,> and we all welcome you <+> in
</+> Delhi <,> and to our studio <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#19:1:B>
Thank you <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#20:1:A>
Uhm the <,,> question that comes to mind right away and which
<w> I've </w> read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection
uh <,> <mention> <indig> Apni Godko </indig> </mention> <,> is it the
transformation in society <,> for survival of the least and the downtrodden
<,> is a mm major concern of yours ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#21:1:A>
But you do not believe as I understand in the change of political
<,> methods <,> or <}> <-> <.> cha </.> </-> <=> change </=> </}> of the
system by political methods <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#22:1:A>
What would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our
country this transformation of society ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#23:1:A>
Would you suggest <,> it can be done through literary writing <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#24:1:B>
I think it would be more correct to say <,,> that I don't
think <,,> any political system <,,> as we see in India <,,> would bring <,,>
any <,> revolutionary change <,> for the downtrodden and the oppressed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#25:1:B>
And it I <,> it would be very <,> what shall I say wishful thinking
to say <,> that only literary writing <,> could bring some changes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#26:1:B>
Of course it will <,> have some effect <,> on the <,> <}> <-> <.>
litery </.> </-> <=> literary </=> </}> section of the society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#27:1:B>
But <,,> to bring any transformation <,,> efforts <}> <-> should
try </-> <,> <=> should be <,,> tried </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#28:1:B>
You know <,> from the grass root level <,> not from the upper level
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#29:1:B>
And the process will be slow <,> process will be gradual <,> and
there must be <,,> concerted efforts <,,> to better the condition of the
downtrodden the oppressed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#30:1:B>
I don't mean always by government methods <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#31:1:B>
By voluntary organisations or other dedicated people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#32:1:B>
Only thus <,> slowly <,,> uh better society can emerge <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#33:1:B>
And this work must be done along with those <,> who have suffered
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#34:1:B>
This work not only <,,> must be done along with those who have
suffered <,> but the initiative also must come from them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#35:1:B>
They will work for their own betterment <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#36:1:A>
Uh how much have you <,> been impressed by your <mention>
Shantiniketan </mention> experience <,> in this uh <,> thought for the <,>
downtrodden the deprived the neglected ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#37:1:B>
I wouldn't say that <mention> Shantiniketan </mention>
upbringing <,,> made me very conscious <,> for the downtrodden and the
oppressed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#38:1:B>
I was in <mention> Shantiniketan </mention> in my childhood when
Tagore was alive <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#39:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> very thankful <,> for those childhood days <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#40:1:B>
<mention> Shantiniketan </mention> taught me <,> a great love of
nature <,> love for humanity in general <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#41:1:B>
But the later phase <,> which is me now <,> it has come after many
changes and ups and downs in my life

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#42:1:A>
And you have had a varied experience in your life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#43:1:A>
Please tell us <,> you often use in your writing <,> my people <,>
and <w> that's </w> the phrase that has really struck me

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#44:1:A>
Because I have come across it several times <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#45:1:A>
I would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say <quote>
my people </quote> <,> <-> you </-> do you use this <,> phrase in a very
particular way or as <,> queens and kings use <,> my people

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#46:1:B>
No <-> the </-> for the queens and kings it would be my
subject <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#47:1:B>
But for me <,,> the suffering bonded labourers of Paramu they are
my people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#48:1:B>
<mention> The Times of India </mention> report regarding a woman
<,> three months ago <,> in Madhya Pradesh <,,> who was tubercular and who
sold her daughter <,,> for <,> as a child labour <,> for hundred <indig>
rupees </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#49:1:B>
<w> She's </w> one of my people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#50:1:B>
You see my India consists of such people <,,> <-> who </-> for whom
still <,> drinking water <,> or right over their land and forest <,> a hut
<,> two meals a day <,> remains a luxury <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#51:1:B>
They are my people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#52:1:B>
Where I say people <,> I mean they <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#53:1:A>
And this is your sustained <,> deep identification with this
particular group

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#54:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#55:1:A>
Uhm I was wondering <,,> when you say that you are <,,>
sensitive about the judgement <,> on the writers you have also said <,> that
they are answerable the writers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#56:1:A>
I was going to ask you <,> is a writer responsible for the state of
a negative uh <,,> situation in our country in society the immoral unethical
values <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#57:1:A>
Uhm <,> <}> <-> are </-> <+> do </+> </}> you really think it is
the job of the writer <,> to reflect the society ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#58:1:A>
Because we have been saying for ages <,> <quote> literature is the
mirror of society </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#59:1:A>
Or do you think it is the duty of these writer <,> to present the
<,> picture truthfully but also work for the solution ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#60:1:A>
I mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails
there that she should be ready for judgement <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#61:1:B>
What I wanted to say <,,> I put it to you <,> as a counter <,>
<w> it's </w> not question <,> some thing else <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#62:1:B>
A writer is a person who lives in the society

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#63:1:A>
She does

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#64:1:B>
A writer receives <,> so much from society <,> but he is also
accountable to the society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#65:1:B>
He has also <}> <-> give </-> <+> given </+> </}> that <,> so a <w>
writer's </w> writing <,> should not lead the society astray <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#66:1:B>
Or <,> a <w> writer's </w> <,> vary todays writings of the Indian
writers from all over India <,> does it reflect the true India <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#67:1:B>
The India is passing through many phases passing through many
changes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#68:1:B>
So <,> uh <.> d d </.> do it <.> lit </.> the Indian literature
until and unless <,> becomes the mirror of the <-> Indian </-> changing
Indian society <,> I wouldn't say <,> that the writers have been very
successful <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#69:1:B>
Also <,> I believe in <?> activism </?> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#70:1:B>
I believe in active work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#71:1:B>
So I think <}> <-> this </-> <+> these </+> </}> writers also
should be <,> conscious <,> of their <}> <-> <.> res </.> </-> <=> social
responsibilities </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#72:1:B>
Try to <,,> alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as
much as they can <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#73:1:B>
I think <,> this should give him <,> better identification with his
reading public

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#74:1:A>
This is a very very excellent point

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#75:1:A>
Because <,> very few I think feel <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#76:1:A>
Not only the writers but <,> <w> let's </w> say citizens of India
<,> that we have received so much from society therefore we are bound <+> to
</+> them <,> to <,> give back in whatever way we can

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#77:1:A>
And what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that
you consider is to get back as much as you can

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#78:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#79:1:A>
Since you are a writer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#80:1:A>
So that some wrong impression that we have <,> that because she is
an activist therefore she is always bringing in <,> these subjects is not
such a true picture as the <,> moral and ethical value have as a writer

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#81:1:A>
That a writer as a citizen <,> writer as a taker of social good <,>
must give back not wait for any one to ask it

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#82:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#83:1:A>
I think uh uh <,> Mahasveta Devi this is very excellent point
and I am happy that you are sharing this with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#84:1:A>
The other thing I wanted to say in this regard <,> would you say
then <,> the readers who read your work <,> really owe it to you because many
of us are your admirers <,> that they also do something <,> actual work <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#85:1:A>
What would you suggest for them <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#86:1:B>
Whoever is uh aware <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#87:1:B>
Wherever one is <,,> he must consider <,> it as <,> his or her
battlefield <,> <indig> jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai
</indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#88:1:B>
One must <,> think of oneself as a soldier <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#89:1:B>
You see our India is a very poor mother <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#90:1:B>
She has so many children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#91:1:B>
The advanced amongst them <,> should not be <,> totally oblivious
of the misery <,> of her poorer <,> children <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#92:1:B>
Everyone should try to do <,> whatever one can

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#93:1:A>
Uhm <w> I'm </w> sure <w> we'll </w> remember that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#94:1:A>
Mahasveta Devi I wanted to ask you please share with us <,> and I
see in not uh <,> far away future <,> those who <,> you are working for the
<indig> adivasis </indig> the neglected the <,> uh forgotten will come into
the mainstream of life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#95:1:A>
I can't prophecy when but they will <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#96:1:A>
But when they come how do you visualise the quality of life
changing atleast beginning to change <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#97:1:B>
Hitherto what has happened that uh <,,> oppressed as a class
the tribals amongst us <,> have been totally bypassed by the <}> <-> <.>
mainstre </.> </-> <=> mainstream </=> </}> society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#98:1:B>
Especially the tribals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#99:1:B>
Great injustice has been done to them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#100:1:A>
Absolutely <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#101:1:B>
Indian history <,> of uh <,> <.> freed </.> Indian freedom
history <,> does not include <,> the tribal anti-imperialist <,,> uh
struggle as part of Indian history <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#102:1:B>
Thus the tribals have always been bypassed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#103:1:B>
I do not want <,,> them to come forward <,> because of mercy from
the main stream <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#104:1:B>
They must know where they are

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#105:1:B>
They must struggle for their own good <,> and they must <,>
advance themselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#106:1:B>
Only thus <,> whatever they are that will be his or her own
earning <,> that is she will be able to retain <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#107:1:B>
If you give someone something <,> <{> <[> yes <,> one may not
value it so much <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#108:1:A>
<[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#109:1:A>
Ah this is a very excellent point

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#110:1:A>
I wanted to say that <,> I have noticed that you have a <,>
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-
Bengali readers <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#111:1:A>
And I know that you <{> <[> are very </[> well known amongst the
<,> non-Bengali readers <,> through translations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#112:1:A>
I wanted to ask you <,> to what do you owe <,> this <?>
gratification </?> and love from them

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#113:1:B>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#114:1:B>
That is one of the <,> turning phases of my life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#115:1:B>
Because <,,> by the time I had written <mention> <indig> Hazar
Chourasia ki Maa </indig> </mention> I had written <mention> Jungle <indig>
Ke Jahagirdar </indig> </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#116:1:B>
But those books were not yet translated into Hindi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#117:1:B>
Hindi <,> in Hindi plenty Bengali literature <,> was being
translated and published <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#118:1:B>
But not my books <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#119:1:B>
Different kind of literature <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#120:1:B>
Arvind kumar <,> now the director of L B T <,> then he had
<mention> Radhakrishna Prakashan </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#121:1:B>
He not only published my books by going forward travelling to
Calcutta <,> but introduced me to a <,,> people unknown to me <}> <-> <.> hi
hi </.> </-> <=> hitherto </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#122:1:B>
Hindi writers poets <indig> patrakars </indig> <,> so many people
I met in Delhi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#123:1:B>
It was like a <indig> mela </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#124:1:B>
Whenever I came <,> I met them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#125:1:B>
It was like a festive occasion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#126:1:B>
On one occasion there was really a <,> <indig> mela </indig> like
festival around me <,> in Triveni <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#127:1:B>
Arvind <O> one word </O> <,> and <,,> had I not known Hindi <,>
readers <,> had I not known the Hindi world of literature <,> I would not
have known greater India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#128:1:B>
Hindi introduced me to <,> greater India <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#129:1:B>
I agree this <w> I'm </w> no longer <,> I do no longer feel <w>
I'm </w> a Bengali writer

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#130:1:B>
I feel I am a Indian writer <,> and I belong to the rest of India
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#131:1:B>
Amongst the Indian writers I have so many friends <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#132:1:B>
For all these things I am very very indebted to the Hindi
literature <,> very very indebted to Arvind Kumar

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#133:1:A>
So we now see the great value of translation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#134:1:A>
There is just probably a little time for you to share any
particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#135:1:B>
I will just tell you a very small incident <,> which is very
important to me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#136:1:B>
In a remote tribal area of Bengal <,,> twenty years ago there was
no school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#137:1:B>
And because there was no land available to build a hut for the
school <,,> a tribal woman Karmisuren <,> she had very little land <,> she
induced <,> interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever
land they had <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#138:1:B>
This poorest woman in the village <,> gave her all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#139:1:B>
An illiterate woman <,> so that a school could could be built <,>
for others to get education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#140:1:B>
<w> Karmisuren's </w> instance <,> till date is <,,> a great one a
pioneering effect to me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#141:1:B>
And I always say that school <,,> I think it will be <,> it will
be government sanctioned very soon

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#142:1:B>
I do not know <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#143:1:B>
We are trying hard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#144:1:B>
My state government is also trying trying hard <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#145:1:B>
But Karmisuren is a great woman <,> whose life should be written
<,> and should reach <,> other parts of India

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-048#146:1:A>
And I would add let us also act like Karmisuren <,> and
Mahasveta Devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-048#147:1:A>
Thank you so much <,> </I>
