Kate <w> Chopin's </w> <mention> The Awakening <,> Sex-role  
Liberation or Sexual Liberation </mention> <,,>  

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#2:1:A>
Over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly  
about the right of woman to passion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#3:1:A>
In fact as Ellen Moers in her <mention> Literary Women </mention>  
says <,> it was Ovid who with his <,> with his <mention> Heroides </mention>  
first gave voice to the heroine in love <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#4:1:A>
According to Moers <,> Ovid started a tradition which extended well  
into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in Britain <,>  
and which was born anew in <w> women's </w> literature of the nineteenth  
century <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#5:1:A>
Mary Wollstonecraft the strong-minded <,> feminist comes to mind in  
this respect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#6:1:A>
For it is in her fiction <,> reviews and letters that <}> <-> <.>  
Wollstone </.> </-> <,> <=> Wollstonecraft </=> </}> is explicit about love  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#7:1:A>
<mention> The Wrongs of Women </mention> or <mention> Maria  
</mention> by Wollstonecraft is a celebration of an unhappy <w> wife's </w>  
<,> adulterous love from the point of view of a woman <,> not only with a  
mind but a body capable of passion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#8:1:A>
Women writers also inherited from Rousseau the novel of adultery <,>  
as seen from the <w> woman's </w> point of view <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#9:1:A>
As Moers put it I quote <,> <quote> The adultery novel after  
Rousseau became the woman <w> writer's </w> vehicle of attack on the economic  
and social class realities <,> that make a mockery of love <,,> as well as a  
vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think <,> feel and act  
for herself </quote> unquote <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#10:1:A>
A whole host of writers and novelists <,> spoke frankly about the  
positive consequences of adultery <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#11:1:A>
George Elliot <,> the Bronte sisters Gaskell Browning Collette and  
Woolf <,> to name only the most well known ones <,> resolved to talk openly  
about the forbidden subject <,> and the right of a woman to participate  
actively <,> and consciously <,> in the affairs of love <,,> <O> clears her  
throat </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#12:1:A>
The American literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a  
traditon of novel writing by women <,> who talk about their heroines from a  
<w> woman's </w> perspective <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#13:1:A>
The awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own  
identity <,> begins only with the publication of Kate <w> Chopin's </w> <,>  
<mention> The Awakening </mention> at the turn of the last century <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#14:1:A>
One may even say that the American <,> <-> that the </-> tradition  
begins in the twentieth century <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#15:1:A>
Incidentaly <mention> The Awakening </mention> may be read as an  
<}> <-> <.> adult </.> </-> <=> adultery </=> </}> novel also <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#16:1:A>
<w> Chopin's </w> novel sent waves of shock among the  
pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#17:1:A>
She became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in Edna  
<,> Pontellier who not only awakens to her sexuality <,> but makes bold to  
confess it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#18:1:A>
Linda Huf puts it succinctly I quote <,,> <quote> The novel <,>  
suggested <,> that the renegade heroine had not forgotten herself <,> but had  
in fact found herself <,,> had awakened to her full potential as a human  
being <,> and all because <,> without consulting any one <,> but her own  
willful self <,> she had taken <}> <-> <.> un </.> </-> <,> <=> an unlawful  
</=> </}> fancy to a younger man </quote> <,> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#19:1:A>
When the novel opens the twenty-eight year old Edna Pontellier is  
holidaying at Grand Isle <,> with her husband Leonce Pontellier <,> and her  
<,> two children <,> Raoul and <,> and Etienne <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#20:1:A>
I am sorry I don't know how to pronounce the French words so I am  
<,> I am just talking in terms of the Anglicised pronunciation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#21:1:A>
Pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those  
husbands who prides himself <,> on his many possessions of which his wife is  
the most precious and attractive <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#22:1:A>
Little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands Edna for  
exposing herself at midday <,> in such heat <,> while bathing in the sea <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#23:1:A>
He is anxious that she should protect her complexion <,> as  
jealously if not more <,> as her honour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#24:1:A>
He scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which  
has suffered some damage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#25:1:A>
During the six years of her married life Edna too has lived like  
any other Southern wife in her beautiful house in New Orleans <,> <}> <->  
immersed </-> <=> immersed </=> </}> in her home and social circle <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#26:1:A>
She was married <,> <-> she sorry </-> she has married Pontellier  
for the same reason as any woman of her class would <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#27:1:A>
She chooses Leonce to become the devoted wife of a man <,> who she  
felt <,> worshiped her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#28:1:A>
She feels she would I quote <,> <quote> Take her place with a  
certain dignity in the world of reality <,> closing the portals forever  
behind her <,> upon the realm of romance and dreams </quote> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#29:1:A>
The opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that  
Edna is one of those usual Southern women <,> who is contented looking after  
her husband and children <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#30:1:A>
Yet <,> through the flashback technique <,> Chopin employs <,> we  
know that Edna had been a different person in her childhood <,> girlhood <,>  
and youth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#31:1:A>
As a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret  
and intense <,> infatuations <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#32:1:A>
First it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer <,> at  
another time it is I quote <quote> the young gentleman who visits a lady on a  
neighbourhood plantation </quote> <,> unquote 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#33:1:A>
Yet a third time it is I quote <quote> the figure of a great  
tragedian <,> that possessed her mind </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#34:1:A>
But marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest  
point of her happiness <,> was not for her in this world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#35:1:A>
However <,> if he does not come in the form of a Leonce <,> he  
comes in the form of Robert Lebrun <,> who awakens her to a sense of herself  
as a person <,> rather than as a piece of personal property <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#36:1:A>
But even before Robert begins to arouse <w> Edna's </w> dormant  
passionate self <,> it is the sea at Grand Isle <,> which <,> without her  
realising it <,> has begun to exert a powerful pull towards her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#37:1:A>
The seductive voice of the sea <,> never ceasing <,> whispering <,>  
clamouring <,> murmuring <,,> invites <w> Edna's </w> soul to wander the  
abyss of solitude <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#38:1:A>
The solitude of the Sea as Judith Fryer aptly says <,> propels a  
real awakening in Edna which I quote <,> <quote> frees her from her place in  
society </quote> <,> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#39:1:A>
Fryer further maintains that in her illumination <,> Edna is most  
like <w> Whitman's </w> <,> <mention> Awakened self </mention> <,> and that  
once we recognize the extent to which <w> Edna's </w> awakening is <,> the  
Whitmanian song of herself <,> the radical nature of <w> Chopin's </w>  
intentions becomes clear <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#40:1:A>
Fryer considers <mention> The awakening </mention> as a song <,> a  
celebration of a woman <,> who awakens to her identity as a person <,> quote  
<,> <quote> defined only in terms of her own experience <,> not in relation  
to any other person </quote> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#41:1:A>
Among the many images that Chopin uses to project either <w> Edna's  
</w> restrictive life <,> or her freedom from this life <,> the Sea is the  
most dominant one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#42:1:A>
It frames both <w> Edna's </w> awakening into life and her final  
suicide <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#43:1:A>
The first six chapters of the book <,> describe the seductive  
quality of the Sea <,> which stirs <w> Edna's </w> awakening <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#44:1:A>
So seductive is the pull of the sea that Edna experiences <,>  
contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to <w> Robert's </w>  
invitation to her <,> to follow him to the shore <,> or into the Sea <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#45:1:A>
I quote <,> this is from the text <,> <quote> A certain light was  
beginning to dawn within her <,> the light <w> which's </w> showing the way  
<,> forbids it <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#46:1:A>
In short <,> Mrs Pontellier was beginning to realize her position  
in the universe <,> as a human being <,> and to recognise her relations as an  
individual <,> to the world within <,> and about her </quote> unquote <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#47:1:A>
That <w> Edna's </w> awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by  
<w> Chopin's </w> description of the Sea <,> and its effect on Edna <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#48:1:A>
The touch of the Sea is sensuous <,> enfolding the body in its soft  
<,> close <,> embrace <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#49:1:A>
When Edna first arrives at Grand Isle she cannot swim <,> the Sea  
is dangerous to her <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#50:1:A>
Quote <,> <quote> A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when  
in the water <,> unless there was a hand near by that <,> might <,> a hand  
near <,> that might reach out and reassure her </quote> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#51:1:A>
And of course <,> it is Robert whose reassuring hand <}> <->  
encourage </-> <=> encourages </=> </}> her to realize her power <,> to  
control her body and soul <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#52:1:A>
<w> Chopin's </w> aim is in describing <w> Edna's </w> trial <,> in  
learning to swim is clear <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#53:1:A>
It becomes symbolic of <w> Edna's </w> moving away from a state of  
dependence <,> fear and repression <,> to a state of independence <,>  
boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#54:1:A>
Edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#55:1:A>
As a consequence <,> her will gradually turns resistant and  
stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her <w> husband's </w> <,> whims <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#56:1:A>
Chopin juxtaposes <w> Edna's </w> emerging self with her previous  
dormant self to show how <,> redundant her husband has become for her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#57:1:A>
Her bathing in the sea with Robert and her going on a day-long boat  
trip <,> further shows <w> Edna's </w> boldness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#58:1:A>
Yet neither while <,> bathing in the sea nor during their day at  
<,> Caminada do we see Edna and Robert in any kind of physical intimacy <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#59:1:A>
In fact <,> the high point of <w> Edna's </w> sensual awakening  
comes when Edna is alone <,> at Madame <,> uh Madame <w> Antoine's </w> <}>  
<-> <.> co </.> <,,> sorry </-> <=> cottage </=> </}> while Robert is waiting  
outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat  
ride to <,> Caminada <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#60:1:A>
More than Robert <,> it is Adele <,> one of the boarders at Grand  
Isle who seems to play a significant role in <w> Edna's </w> sensual  
awakening <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#61:1:A>
It is Adele who <}> <-> <.> em </.> </-> <=> emboldens </=> </}>  
Edna to exalt over her body <,> without any shame <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#62:1:A>
Chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with  
which the two women <,> sit and talk on the beach <,> at Grand Isle <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#63:1:A>
Yet as long as Edna is on Grand Isle <,> her awakening remains at  
the level of the sensual only <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#64:1:A>
There is no element of sex involved in her relationship with Robert  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#65:1:A>
Before such a possibility arises <,> Robert leaves for Mexico <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#66:1:A>
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences <foreign> vis-a-vis  
</foreign> Arobin <,> comes much later 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#67:1:A>
This is a lover that she consciously takes in the <,> in the novel  
it is shown <-> that </-> later in the novel <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#68:1:A>
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences <foreign> vis-a-vis  
</foreign> Arobin comes much later <,> after she has emancipated herself <,>  
from her marital <,> familial and social ties <,> after her return to New  
Orleans <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#69:1:A>
Edna has begun to defy her <w> husband's </w> whims even while they  
are at Grand Isle <,> that is on the holiday <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#70:1:A>
But in New Orleans <,> where they live <w> it's it's </w> their  
home there <,,> she decides to free herself not only from her family duties  
but also from her social commitments <,> like her weekly reception day <,>  
which she has had to observe to further <,> her <w> husband's </w> business  
<,> and his status in society <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#71:1:A>
She defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#72:1:A>
As if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting  
<,> which at first she undertakes to kill the boredom of her life <,> but  
later with a seriousness <,> which eventually helps her <,> helps her to  
handle her brush <,> with a new sureness and ease <,> helping her to work <,>  
to grow <,> in force and individuality 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#73:1:A>
These are all textual quotes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#74:1:A>
The next step in <w> Edna's </w> emancipation <,> is her desire to  
become <,> economically independent <,> which she becomes with the help of  
her teacher <,> Laidpore <,> who sells some of her paintings for her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#75:1:A>
This in addition to her small inheritance <,,> plus the money she  
has won at the race track <,> makes it possible for her <,> to buy her pigeon  
house 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#76:1:A>
She lives in a <,> separate house from her <w> husband's </w> now  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#77:1:A>
Thus Edna awakens to her full identity <,> as an individual <,>  
quietly but firmly <,> freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife  
and mother <,> which society has imposed on her <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#78:1:A>
An important influence on Edna in arousing her later creativity <,>  
which ultimately makes her a professional painter <,> is Madame Reisz <,> a  
pianist <,,> Edna has met at Grand Isle <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#79:1:A>
Edna has been attracted by <w> Reisz's </w> professional  
performance that is <,> soiree for the vacationers <,> S O I R E E please how  
do we pronounce it ? <X> 
 
<$Z> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-043#X80:1:Z>
Soiree </X> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-043#81:1:A>
Soiree <,> okay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#82:1:A>
But more than this Edna has been fascinated by <,> <w> Reisz's </w>  
independence and her self-assertion <,> and her tendency to trample on the  
rights of others <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#83:1:A>
In New Orleans too Edna calls on Reisz quite often to hear her play  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#84:1:A>
The atmosphere of her room invades Edna with repose <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#85:1:A>
<w> Reisz's </w> music has the <}> <-> <.> cons </.> </-> <=>  
consistent </=> </}> effect of playing upon the responsive chords <,> of her  
inner being <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#86:1:A>
Although <w> Reisz's </w> rudeness and offensive manners try <w>  
Edna's </w> patience <,> her divine art reaches <w> Edna's </w> spirit <,>  
and sets it free <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#87:1:A>
Her observation that <,> <w> Reisz's </w> observation in the text I  
quote <,> <quote> To be an artist includes much <,> one must possess many  
gifts <,> which have not been acquired <,> by <w> one's </w> own effort <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#88:1:A>
To succeed <,> the artist must possess the courageous soul <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#89:1:A>
The soul that dares and defies </quote> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#90:1:A>
Challenges Edna to further free herself <,> from the shackles of  
social conventions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#91:1:A>
Probably it is <w> Reisz's </w> indifference <,> and unconcern for  
social norms <,> and conventions <,> that emboldens Edna to confess <,> what  
she has not been able to do to anyone <,> her passion for Robert <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#92:1:A>
It is then that Reisz says something <,> that is at the centre of  
<w> Chopin's </w> examination in the novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#93:1:A>
I quote <,,> <quote> The bird that would soar above the level plain  
of tradition and prejudice <,> must have strong wings <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#94:1:A>
It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings <,> bruised <,>  
exhausted <,> fluttering back to earth </quote> <,> unquote <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#95:1:A>
Obviousely through the bird imagery <,> which like the imagery of  
the sea flows throughout the novel <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-043#96:1:A>
Chopin is trying to portray the plight of women <,> who either  
remain imprisoned in cages of conventions <,> or tear these conventions of  
<,> and soar freely <,> doing what they want to do <,> or after having dared  
to defy and soar <,> find the freedom so daunting <,> that like weaklings <,>  
they fall on the land bruised and broken <,,> </I>
