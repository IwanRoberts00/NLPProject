It is expected to help in a big way in establishing the rural

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#110:1:B>
Our correspondent Sudhanshu Ranjan <,> reports from Jaipur <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-004#111:1:E>
The system of providing telephone connections through radio
beams is very economical as compare to providing telephone connections
through line <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#112:1:E>
More so in the rural areas <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#113:1:E>
Sometimes it is not feasible to provide telephone connections in
terrains like mountains and rivers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#114:1:E>
The system operates on a very high frequency V H F <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#115:1:E>
The radio unit will be kept in the central place from where <,>
telephone wire can be thrown <,> and only the telephone set has to be
installed in the subscribers premises <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#116:1:E>

Fractionation of blood or separation of blood into its components
<,> has come to India too <,>

Blood can now be broken down to its elements <,> in India
also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#122:1:F>
Broadly speaking <,> human blood has red blood corpuscles <,>
platalet <,> and proteins like algumin fibrogin and immoglobins suspended in
water <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#123:1:F>
Each component has a specific role to play in the body <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#124:1:F>
Uptill now <,> whole blood had to be given to a patient in need of
even one of these components <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#125:1:F>
Now <,> with the breakdown of blood <,> at the plasma centre of K
E M hospital <,> a patient of anaemia can be given R B <w> C's </w> alone <,>
or a victim of burns can get algumin only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#126:1:F>
A highly sophisticated technique called tromatography is being
used for separation of blood components <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#127:1:F>
This way one unit of blood which was being used for one person
alone <,> can now be used by eight <,>

<ICE-IND:S2B-004#128:1:F>
This can go a long way <,> in overcoming the shortage of blood in
