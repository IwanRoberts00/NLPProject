<ICE-IND:W2A-016#3:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> IN </smallcaps> </bold> the nineteenth century,
entrepreneurs owned and managed the business of companies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#4:1>
But, with the growth of modern companies, there has come about a
separation of ownership and control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#5:1>
There has been a shift of power, from those who own, to those who
control and manage the modern companies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#6:1>
This divergence of ownership and control has led to a divergence of
interest.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#7:1>
Now-a-days, a shareholder is more interested in the income and capital
appreciation of his investment, rather than the company as an enterprise.
<sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#8:1>
These observations have been made in the English context, but are true
even in the Indian context. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#9:1>
The growth of institutional investment is a major factor in this
process of separation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#10:1>
The financial institutions are not usually skilled in the management
nor even necessarily interested in the detailed operations of the companies
in which they have invested.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#11:1>
This has, in turn, led to a shift of power, from those who own, to
those who control the companies.<sp> <fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#12:1>
The term <quote> ` financial institutions' </quote> has not been
defined in the Companies Act, 1956.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#13:1>
Here, it may be relevant to look at the definition of financial
institutions in the United States of America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#14:1>
The Uniform Probate Code, paragraph 6-101(3) defines financial
institutions as: <quote> " any organisation authorised to do business under
state or federal laws relating to financial institutions, including, without
limitation, banks and trust companies, savings banks, building and loan
associations, savings and loan companies or associations, and credit
unions.<+>"</+> </quote> <sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#15:1>
The Companies ( Amendment ) Act, 1974 has introduced the concept
of <quote> ` public financial institutions' </quote> into the Companies Act,
1956, vide section 4 A.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#16:1>
Section 4A ( I ) names the various financial institutions that were
to be regarded as public financial institutions and section 4A ( 2 ) states
that the Central Government may notify any other institution to be a public
financial institution, but such an institution must have been established or
constituted by or under any Act of Parliament or that not less than 51 per
cent of the paid-up share capital of such an institution should be held or
controlled by the Central Government.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#17:1>
The Central Government has, from time to time, notified various
institutions that are public financial institutions. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#18:1>
<h> <bold> WHAT IS CONTROL ? </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#19:1>
The control of a company is a difficult concept to define as a
matter of law, but essentially, it denotes the relationship which exists when
an individual or a group of individuals who are clearly identifiable in some
respect or respects and who may themselves be incorporated exercise powers of
direction and dominance over the affairs of a company.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#20:1>
It is not easy to locate control in a corporation as there is no set
rule for determining control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#21:1>
An individual Corporation may be related to other corporations,
banks, financial institutions, etc. <it> via </it> complex patterns of
shareholdings, interlocking directorships, etc. and so a case-by-case
approach is necessary. <sp> <fnr> 4 </fnr> </sp> </p> <*> line through
column</*>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#22:1>
Control is defined in the draft United States Federal Securities
Code, section 202, as follows: <quote> " control means power, directly or
indirectly to exercise controlling influence over management or policies of a
company or the activities of a natural person, either alone or pursuant to an
arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons whether through
the ownership of voting securities, through one or more intermediary persons,
by contract or otherwise." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#23:1>
<mention> Berle and Means </mention> were the first to trace the
development of the concept of control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#24:1>
In their book <it> <mention> The Modern Corporation </mention> </it>
and <it> <mention> Private Property, </mention> </it> they identified
different species of control in the modern company, which were: </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#25:1>
<h> <bold> 1. Control through complete ownership </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#26:1>
This was a straightforward category which resembled the position
in private companies in which a single individual or small group of
associates own all or practically all the shares in the company.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#27:1>
In such case, the ownership and control are in the same hands. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#28:1>
<h> <bold> 2. Majority control </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#29:1>
This is the first step in separation oF ownership and control.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#30:1>
It consists of ownership of majority of the <w> company's </w> issued
shares.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#31:1>
This brings in virtually all the legal powers of control. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#32:1>
<h> <bold> 3. Control through legal devices </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#33:1>
This category is more common in the United States than to the
Common wealth.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#34:1>
It was the practice of voting trusts and shareholder agreements and
pyramiding.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#35:1>
Pyramiding involves the owning of stock of one company which in turn,
holds stock in another. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#36:1>
<h> <bold> 4 ( a). Minority control </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#37:1>
This category of control exists when individual small groups hold
sufficient interest to be in a position to dominate a company through share
interest.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#38:1>
The large the company, the easier it is to have minority control, but
everything depends on the situation in a particular company. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#39:1>
<h> <bold> 4 ( b). Management control </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#40:1>
This category is characterised by shares initially being so
widely distributed that no individual or small group has even a minority
interest to dominate the affairs of the company. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#41:1>
Today, in India, the largest shareholders in the public limited
companies tend to be the public financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#42:1>
It is then difficult to determine whether there is management control
or minority control or negative control vested in the hands of these
financial institutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#43:1>
Do the public financial institutions have control?

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#44:1>
In a sense, the rise of the investor reproduces something with which
the law has had to deal ever since the advent of the modern company: the
concentration of power in the hands of one or more shareholders.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#45:1>
This affords to the controlling shareholder the <O> <&> page </&> 932
</O> power to influence the dividend policy and in many cases, the management
of the whole company.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#46:1>
There is also a power to influence management through threats to sell
shareholdings or to work against management can be made to tow the line of
the public financial institutions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#47:1>
The financial institutions can be said to be just another example of
a power bloc within a company. <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#48:1>
In India, the public financial institutions are major
shareholders in public limited companies, but do they have <quote> ` control'
</quote> over these companies ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#49:1>
This question can be answered by looking at two major acts, which a
public financial institution could perform, by virtue of its majority
shareholding. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#50:1>
<h> <bold> ACTS OPPRESSIVE TO THE MINORITY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#51:1>
In <it> <mention> Nagappa Chettiar v. Madras Race Club,
</mention> </it> <sp> <fnr> 6 </fnr> </sp> the court ruled that the rule laid
down in <it> <mention> Foss v. Harbottle </mention> <sp> <fnr> 7 </fnr> </sp>
</it> , along with its exceptions, held good in India courts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#52:1>
The rule is that the company is the right person to sue and that it
is not open to the individual members to assume to themselves the right of
suing in the name of the company, except where the transaction is illegal;
where the transaction requires the sanction of a special majority; where the
transaction infringes the personal rights of the shareholders; and where the
transaction amounts to a fraud on the minority.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#53:1>
But, the company can only act through the board of directors and they
may well be the wrong-doers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#54:1>
They may, therefore, decide not to sue a decision approved by the
company in the general meeting, where the wrong-doers control the majority of
votes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#55:1>
The outcome would be that the wrong doers would go unpunished and
minority shareholders would be at the mercy of the majority who could loot
the company.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#56:1>
In such a case, control exists because the wrong-doers have a
majority of votes and have actually approved the fraud.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#57:1>
Further, if in this case, the minority shareholders brought an action
and were able to show that the defendants, by any means of manipulation of
their position in the company, were able to ensure that no action was
brought, it would clearly go to show that the defendants were in control.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#58:1>
In <it> <mention> Prudential Assurance Company Limited v. Newman
Industries Limited </mention> ( No. 2) <sp> <fnr> 8 </fnr> </sp> </it> , it
was held that while the plaintiff in an action for wrong done to the company
is normally the company itself, in exceptional circumstances a minority
shareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the company where the
wrong done to the company is a fraud and the wrong-doers are in majority,
thereby preventing the company from suing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#59:1>
Even if an exception can be successfully invoked, a number of
difficulties beset the path of the shareholder who decides to pursue an
action against the alleged wrong doers. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#60:1>
The transactions are often of a complicated nature and so it is
difficult to establish what the transaction involves and who the
beneficiaries are.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#61:1>
A large amount of money is also required to pursue an action of such
a nature. <sp> <fnr> 9 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#62:1>
The better non-statutory option open to an aggrieved shareholder
in such a case is to withdraw his investment from the company by selling his
shares.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#63:1>
The statutory alternatives open to an aggrieved shareholder include
petitioning the Company Law Board under section 397 or 398. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#64:1>
Section 397 provides, <quote> " any members of a company who
complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner
prejudicial to public interest or in a manner oppressive to any member or
members ( including any one or more of themselves) may apply to the Company
Law Board for an order under this section <*> dotted line</*>" </quote>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#65:1>
Section 397 ( 2) lays down that in order grant relief under this
section, there should be facts to justify the making of a winding up order.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#66:1>
The aggrieved shareholder can also proceed under section 398.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#67:1>
In order to grant relief under this section, it is not necessary to
show that there are facts which justify the making of a winding up order.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#68:1>
It is enough if the affairs of the company are being conducted in a
manner prejudicial to the interests of the company or to public interest.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#69:1>
The <quote> ` words in a manner prejudicial to public interest'
</quote> were inserted in sections 397, 398 and 408 by the Companies (
Amendment ) Act, 1963.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#70:1>
This enables the Central Government to move the Company Law Board
under these sections, <it> <mention> <foreign> suo motu </foreign> </mention>
, </it> on grounds of public interest. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#71:1>
In <it> <mention> State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh </mention>
<sp> <fnr> 10 </fnr> </sp> </it> Mahajan CJ, opined: <quote> " the expression
[ public interest] is not capable of precise definition and has not a rigid
meaning, and is elastic and takes its colours from the statute in which it
occurs, the concept varying with the time and state of society and its needs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#72:1>
Thus, what is <quote> ` public interest' </quote> today may not be so
considered a decade later.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#73:1>
In any case, the expression cannot be considered in vacuo but must be
decided on the facts and circumstances." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#74:1>
The concept of <quote> ` public interest' </quote> takes the
company outside the conventional sphere of being a concern in which the
shareholders alone are interested.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#75:1>
It emphasizes the idea that the company functions for the general
welfare of the community <sp> <fnr> 11 </fnr> </sp> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#76:1>
In practice, it is difficult to sustain an application on the
ground that the affairs of a company are conducted in a manner prejudicial to
public interest because, conducting the affairs in such a manner cannot be a
just an equitable ground for winding up of the company unless the affairs of
the company should be considered illegal or opposed to public policy <sp>
<fnr> 12 </fnr> </sp> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#77:1>
<h> <bold> DISMISSAL OF DIRECTORS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#78:1>
The day-to-day control of the business of a company is in the
hands of directors.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#79:1>
As a matter of company law, shareholders cannot intervene in the
management of the <w> company's </w> affairs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#80:1>
Section 284 ( 1), however, provides that the shareholders may, by
ordinary resolution, remove a director ( not being a director appointed by
the Central Government in pursuance of section 408 ) from office.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#81:1>
Under section 284 ( 2), special notice has to be given of any such
resolution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#82:1>
Section 284(3) provides that the company must supply a copy of the
resolution to the concerned <O> <&> page </&> 933 </O> director, who is
entitled to be heard at the meeting.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#83:1>
Further section 284 ( 4) provides that he may require the company to
circulate, to shareholders, any representation he makes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#84:1>
This elaborate procedure is laid down to prevent a director from
being deprived of an office of profit without having had an opportunity of
being heard. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#85:1>
Therefore, even if the shareholders act malafide or out of spite
against a particular director, there is no basis in Indian Company Law for an
injunction restraining the company from giving effect to the resolution,
provided only, that requirements of the aforesaid section have been met. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#86:1>
A dismissed director could petition under section 433 ( f), for
winding up of the company on just and equitable ground.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#87:1>
But, the Supreme Court has shown in <it> Hind Overseas ( P) Ltd v.
Raghunat Prasad Junjhunwala <sp> <fnr> 13 </fnr> </sp> </it> , that it is not
in favour of such a remedy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#88:1>
Here, a private company was formed, in which an employee <mention> "
A" </mention> , who had gained the confidence of the employer <mention> " B"
</mention> , was taken in as managing director.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#89:1>
<mention> " A" </mention> and his family members held about one-third
of the shares while <mention> " B" </mention> and his family members held
about two-thirds of the shares and the direction, control and financial
responsibility were also in <w> <quote> " B's" </quote> </w> hands.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#90:1>
The Supreme Court held that it was not a case in which the
dissolution of partnership principle could be invoked in favour of <quote> "
A" </quote> ( and his group of shareholders ) on the <quote> ` just and
equitable ground' </quote> , as several remedies such as those under sections
397 and 398 were open to the minority shareholders under the Companies Act,
1956, and an application for winding up the company would be unreasonable.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-016#91:1>
Thus, a financial institution can effectively exercise control by
removing the directors of the company, in which it is a major shareholder.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#92:1>
The financial institution has to ensure that an ordinary resolution
is passed authorising the removal of a director, and that the relevant
provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, are complied with.

<ICE-IND:W2A-016#93:1>
This threat of removal could be effectively used to influence the
decisions of the management. </p>
