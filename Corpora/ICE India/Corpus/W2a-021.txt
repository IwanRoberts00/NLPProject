<h> <bold> Abstract. </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#6:1>
The oxidation of a number of dyes in predominantly aqueous systems by
tetraphenylporphyrinato manganese ( III ) imidazole, MnTPP ( Im ) , activated
peroxy bleach has been studied in the context of application in detergent
systems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#7:1>
Dyes with an olefinic linkage in the chromophoric group are readily
oxidized by perborate even in the absence of the activator.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#8:1>
On the other hand, dyes with an azo linkage are resistant to oxidation
and are bleached only to a limited extent ( 25 % ) even by MnTPP ( Im )
activated perborate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#9:1>
In the presence of a surfactant, alkylbenzene sulphonate, bleaching is
further inhibited by micellar solubilization of the dyes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#10:1>
Sulphonation of MnTPP(Im) only marginally improves the bleaching
efficiency in presence of the surfactant.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#11:1>
MnTPP ( Im ) is also destroyed by perborate in the absence of the
substrate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#12:1>
In view of these limitations, the metalloporphyrin activated peroxy
bleach system is not promising for application in detergent systems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#13:1>
Attempts have also been made to explain the difference in the
behaviour of different substrates on structural consideration. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#16:1>
Transition metal complex mediated oxidation processcs are
receiving attention in recent times.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#17:1>
This concept is based on the analogy with cytochrome P-450 whose key
feature is the involvement of a metalloprophyrin complex ( Coon and White
1980; Guengerich and MacDonald 1985 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#18:1>
The oxidation of olefins to epoxides ( White and Coon 1980; Collman
<it> et al </it> 1985 ) , alkanes to alcohols ( Guengerich and MacDonald 1984 )
, dialkylamines to amine oxides ( Poulos <it> et al </it> 1985 ) with oxygen
supply from an exogenous source has given a lot of impetus to work on model
systems using metalloporphyrins.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#19:1>
High valent metallophorphyrin oxidizing species have been obtained
with iron ( Groves <it> et al </it> 1981 ) , manganese ( Hill and Schardt
1980 ) and chromium ( Groves and Haushalter 1981 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#20:1>
Most of the studies rcported employ oxygen donors such as
alkylhydroperoxide, peracids, iodosylbenzene, amine oxide, persulphate (
Collman <it> et al </it> 1985; Depoorter and Meunier 1985; Groves and Quinn
1985; Renaud <it> et al </it> 1985 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#21:1>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#23:1>
We thought it would be worthwhile examining the versatility of
the metalloporphyrin mediated peroxy bleach system by studying the bleaching
of dyes in predominantly aqueous systems by manganese porphyrins.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#24:1>
A range of dyes with different reactive groups such as azo, olefinic
and different structural features have been selected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#25:1>
Bleaching experiments have been carried out in two solvent systems
and also in a micellar system to delineate the behaviour in these systems.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#26:1>
We also wanted to examine the applicability of this bleaching
principle to detergent systems and have, therefore, used sodium perborate, a
common bleaching agent in detergent systems as the oxygen donor and linear
alkylbenzene sulphonate ( LAS), a versatile surfactant used in detergents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#27:1>
We also felt that it would be of interest to study the effect of
solubilizing the metalloporphyrin through sulphonation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#37:1>
Distilled water was used for preparation of solutions. </p>

</O> removed using a high vacuum rotary evaporator.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#41:1>
The dried reaction mixture was then slurried in sodium acetate
solution and extracted with chloroform.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#42:1>
After shaking for several minutes, the aqueous phase was separated.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#43:1>
Chloroform layer was taken in a rotary evaporator to remove the
solvent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#44:1>
The final product was again extracted with chloroform in a Soxhlet
thimble and recrystallised.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#45:1>
The preparation was as per Adler <it> et al </it> ( 1970 ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#46:1>
2.2b <it> Tetra ( p-sulphophenylporphyrinato ) manganese ( III )
acetate </it> ( Mn TPPS ) : 50 mg tetra ( <it> p</it>-sulphophenyl )
porphyrin and 200 mg manganous acetate tetrahydrate were stirred in 100 ml
methanol at 40-50 <*> degree </*> C for three hours.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#47:1>
The solution was then kept overnight in the dark.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#48:1>
The solution after ageing was filtered and concentrated on a water
bath.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#49:1>
The product was extracted in a Soxhlet thimble with methanol and
further recrystallised. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#50:1>
In the bleaching experiments imidazole was used as an axial
ligand to stabilize the higher valency manganese complex.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#51:1>
The stock solution of MnTPP ( OAC ) ( 5 x 10<sp>-4</sp> M ) was
prepared in methanol containing 10-fold excess of imidazole, while the
solution of MnTPPS ( OAC ) ( 5 x 10<sp>-4</sp> M ) was prepared in distilled
water containing excess imidazole.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#52:1>
Under these conditions it has been estabilished that OAC is
substituted by imidazole in the complex ( Renaud <it> et al </it> 1985 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#53:1>
The activator species are therefore ( 5, 10, 15, 20 tetraphenyl
porphyrinato ) manganese ( III ) imidazole and 5, 10, 15, 20 tetra ( <it>
p</it>-sulphophenyl porphyrinato ) manganese ( III ) imidazole and these will
be referred to in the rest of the text as MnTPP ( Im) and MnTPPS ( Im)
respectively. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#55:1>
Methanolic solutions of quinaldine blue and methyl red were used
for bleaching experiments.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#56:1>
Stock solutions of direct red-81, direct red-23, rhodamine B,
rhodamine 6G, eriochrome black T, eriochrome blue black, sunset yellow,
tartrazine, methyl orange, carrmine MS and carmine AS were prepared in water,
while DMF solutions of direct yellow 9, 4-dimethylaminobenzylidene rhodanine
and quinaldine red were used.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#57:1>
Solutions of sodium perborate ( 2 % ) , LAS ( 59 % ) ,
Na<sb>2</sb>C0<sb>3</sb> ( 05 % ) and STP ( 0.25 % ) were prepared in water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#58:1>

The decay of the substrate concentration was followed by
measuring the decrease in optical density at the appropriate absorption
maximum of substrates with time on Hewlett-Packard HP 8451 diode array
spectrophotometer ( figure 2 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#61:1>
The reaction mixture contained 0 22 % LAS, 0.1 % STP, 0.2 %
Na<sb>2</sb>C0<sb>3</sb>, 1.89 x 10<sp>-5</sp> M MnTPP ( Im ) or 2.5 x
10<sp>-5</sp> M MnTPPS ( Im ) and 0.38 % sodium perborate.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#62:1>
LAS was not present in the experiments carried out in aqueous
methanol or DMF.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#63:1>
The reaction was initiated by adding 0.05 ml of 2 % sodium perborate
solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#64:1>
The same experiment was repeated in the absence of MnTPP ( Im ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#65:1>
The chromophore concentration was suitably adjusted for measurement
of optical density.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#66:1>
In aqueous methanolic or aqueous DMF medium the same ingredients have
been used with water to solvent ratio 1: 0.6 ( figure 3 ) . </p> <O> <&> page

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#70:1>
The Soret band of MnTPP ( OAC ) was observed at 466 nm in
methanol and this value is in good agreement with the literature value.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#71:1>
The absorption spectrum of MnTPPS ( Im ) is given in figure 4.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#72:1>
The Soret band is at 470nm and in addition there is a doublet at 380
and 400nm.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#73:1>
The results on the bleaching of 17 substrates with MnTPP ( Im ) in
aqueous methanol, aqueous DMF and aqueous LAS solutions have been presented
in table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#74:1>
The results on the oxidation of substrates with MnTPPS ( Im ) are
given in table 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#75:1>
Typical curves giving thc absorption spectrum as a function of time
for direct red-81 as an example are given in figure 2.

The change in absorbance in the presence and absence of MnTPP ( Im )
as a function of time at the <*> i</*> max of the substrate are given in

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#80:1>
The absorption spectra as a function of time presented in figure
2 in the case of direct red-81 is indicative of the typical course of
reaction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#81:1>
Decrease in absorption at 514 nm, the strong absorption maximum of
the dye, and simultaneous increase in absorption at 400nm, which is
suggestive of the formation of a less conjugated product, are clearly seen.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#82:1>
The absorption spectra of the reaction mixture in the case of
quinaldine blue before addition of perborate and after the reaction is
complete are presented in figure 3 and the results again show the
disappearance of the strong maximum and increase in absorption / appearance
of new peaks at lower wave lengths again indicating the formation of species
with reduced conjugation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#83:1>
There is a decrease in the intensity of the Soret band showing that
some of the MnTPP ( Im ) is also oxidized. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#84:1>
In the absence of the substrate MnTPPS ( Im ) appears to react
readily with perborate ( figure 4 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#85:1>
At first there is a shift in the absorption maximum from 470 nm to
436 nm and the doublet at 380 and 400 nm disappears ( the peak at 400 nm
might have merged with the primary maximum ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#86:1>
These spectral changes may perhaps be due to the formation of the
higher valent manganese complex ( as shown in the scheme in figure ( 6 ) (
Hill and Schardt 1980 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#87:1>
However, within 5 minutes MnTPPS ( Im ) is totally destroyed as
perceived by the drastic reduction in intensity of the absorption bands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#88:1>
It is seen from the results on the oxidation of the substrates by
perborate in the absence of MnTPP ( Im ) in aqueous methanolic solution that
as expected quinaldine blue and quinaldine red with olefinic linkage between
the aromatic moieties are the <O> <&> page </&> 89 </O> <O> Table 1. </O> <O>

</caption> </O> most susceptible species for bleaching.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#89:1>
Rhodamine 6G with quaternary group is also susceptible to bleaching
although not to the same extent as the dyes with the olefinic linkage.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#90:1>
However, rhodamine <it> B </it> is very resistant to bleaching.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#91:1>
This resistance is perhaps due to the additional electron donating
alkyl substitution on the quaternary nitrogen thus imparting a stabilizing
effect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#92:1>
The azo dyes appear to be resistant to oxidation by perborate and
less than 10 % bleaching has been noticed in the case of all the azo dyes
examined.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#93:1>
Even in the presence of the activator, MnTPP ( Im ) the azo dyes are
bleached only to a limited extent of 25 %.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#94:1>
The only exception is eriochrome blue black which is bleached in the
presence of the catalyst in aqueous methanolic/DMF medium to the extent of 90
%.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#95:1>
Azo dyes as a class are known for their stability.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#96:1>
However, the reasons for the susceptibility of eriochrome blue black
to bleaching are not clear.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#97:1>
The reactions in <O> <&> page </&> 91 </O> <O> formula </O> <O>
<caption> Figure 6. Suggested mechanism for oxidation of substrates by
manganese prophyrin complexes. </caption> </O> the case of this dye also
appear to be somewhat complex.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#98:1>
The dye is bleached within a few seconds, but with time the colour is
partially regained. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#99:1>
In the case of oxidation in aqueous methanol it is seen from
results presented in table 1 that quinaldine blue, quinaldine red and
rhodamine 6G are oxidized by perborate even in the absence of MnTPP ( Im ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#100:1>
In aqueous DMF quinaldine blue is not oxidized.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#101:1>
The reasons for this solvent effect are not very clear.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#102:1>
In general, it has been found in the case of most of the dyes
studied that the extent of oxidation increases in presence of MnTPP ( Im ) ,
the only exception being rhodamine B.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#103:1>
In the presence of the activator also isolated cases of solvent
effect are perceived.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#104:1>
Eriochrome black T appears to be more resistant to oxidation in
methanolic medium.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#105:1>
It has been reported that olefins show higher rates of oxidation in
methanolic medium because the high valent oxomanganese species ( oxygen
transferring ) rapidly reacts with substrate ( Razenberg <it> et al </it>
1986 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#106:1>
However, no such general trend was observed in the case of the dyes
examined. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-021#107:1>
On substitution of manganese by cobalt it was found that the
catalyzing effect was completely lost.

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#108:1>
Quinaldine blue, quinaldine red, direct red 81, eriochrome blue
black which are bleached in aqueous DMF by MnTPP ( Im ) were not at all
bleached by CoTPP ( Im ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-021#109:1>
The reasons for the ineffectivity of CoTPP ( Im ) may be due to the
lack of formation of high valent oxygen donating species. </p> </I>
