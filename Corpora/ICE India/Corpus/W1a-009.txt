<h> <ul> <w> GOVERNMENT'S </w> LEGAL EFFORTS AND PROGRAMMES FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#2:1>
<w> Today's </w> generation is going through a valuable phase.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#3:1>
Nature and environment, which gave birth to man and nursed him, is in
peril.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#4:1>
Environmental preservations, on which the very existence of mankind is
dependent, is posing an overriding challenge to him.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#5:1>
Environmental degradation is not a new problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#6:1>
It has been arising ever since the human civilization began on earth
and man began to exploit the natural resources for his survival.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#7:1>
But at that time the population was not so imposing a problem as it is
now.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#8:1>
Therefore, environment was not much affected.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#9:1>
With the arrival of Western Culture in India, consumerist culture
began to flourish, and worked havoc on environment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#10:1>
Nature and environment was given great importance from the
Rigvedic period to the medieval period.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#11:1>
<ul> A Sulkta </ul> ( Verse ) of Rigveda states that, <quote> " The
sky is like a father, the earth is like a mother and the space like their
son.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#12:1>
This, universe consisting of three is like a family.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#13:1>
Any kind of damage to any one of the three throws the universe off
balance." </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#14:1>
The aim in giving such messages was to warn people of the hazards <O>
<&> page </&> 2 </O> of environmental pollutiion.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#15:1>
In <quote> ` Chanakya <indig> Niti </indig> ' </quote> , it is said
that planting even a single tree with fruits and flowers makes the
environment full of fragrance just as a family becomes delighted with a
worthy son.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#16:1>
Hence, we will be safe, so far the earth is full of nature. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#17:1>
<h> <ul> ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION : WHOSE CONCERN ? </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#18:1>
The term environment includes water, air, land and human beings
and other living creatures.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#19:1>
<quote> ` Environmental Pollutant' </quote> or <quote> ` hazardous
substance' </quote> means <mention> any solid, liquid or gas in such
concentration as may be injurious to environment or any substance which by
virtue of its chemical or physical properties is liable to cause harm to
environment. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#20:1>
The Central Government has been given power to <quote> " take all
such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the people of protecting
and improving the quality of the environment" </quote> and preventing
environmental pollution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#21:1>
It can lay down standards for quality of environment / emissions or
discharge of pollutants, specify areas where certain industries shall not be
located and in other cases may lay down procedures and safeguards for
prevention of accidents that may cause environmental pollution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#22:1>
The government may aso examine manufacturing or other processes that
can cause pollution, inspect, investigate and carry out related research
besides establishing / recognising environmental laboratories and
institutions to carry out functions entrusted <O> <&> page </&> 3 </O> under
the Act.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#23:1>
There is heavy punishment for contravention of the Act, rules,
directiion in the form of <mention> fines or imprisonment, or both
</mention> , irrespective of the fact that the defaulter is a firm, company
or government department.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#24:1>
The Government, if it deems fit, may direct closure, prohibition, or
regulation of an industry, operation and process or that of any service such
as electricity, water, etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#25:1>
<h> <ul> GOVERNMENT LEGAL EFFORTS AND PROGRAMMES TO CONTROL THE
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#26:1>
There are more than 200 Central and state laws today that can be
interpreted one way or other to protect the environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#27:1>
The earliest of them, the Shore Nuisance ( Bombay and Kolaba ) Act
dates back to 1853.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#28:1>
But laws enacted with the specific intention of controlling
environmental degradation have been slow coming, partly because of inadequate
appreciations of environmental problems and partly because of wrong notions
about legislative competence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#29:1>
Until 1976, environment protection as such did not figure
anywhere in the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#30:1>
In the 7th schedule, which classifies various legislative <}> <->
entires </-> <+> entries </+> </}> into three groups, <mention> the Union
List, the State List, and the Concurrent List, </mention> there are various
entries like forests and wildlife related to environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#31:1>
On the fact of it, it seemed that state legislatures alone are
empowered to legslate on some of the most vital matters <}> <-> effecting
</-> <+> affecting </+> </}> environment. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#32:1>
<h> <ul> CONSTITUTION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#33:1>
When the Constitution was amended for the 42nd time in 1976,
certain environmental provisions were incorporated.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#34:1>
For the first time the expression <quote> " environmental protection"
</quote> found a place and this led many scholars to argue that by 42nd
amendment, the Central Government wanted certain powers which it did not have
to protect the environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#35:1>
But this was not true. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#36:1>
<h> <ul> DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#37:1>
Article 48 A was added to the <mention> Directive Principles of
State Policy </mention> and stated : <quote> " The State shall endeavour to
protect and improve the natural environment and safeguard the forest and
wildlife in the country" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#38:1>
In the chapter on <mention> fundamental duties </mention> , which
itself was inserted into the constitution for the first, Article 51 A(g)
provided : <quote> " It shall be the duty of every citizen of Indian to
protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes,
rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#39:1>
Besides this, the entries dealing with <quote> ` forests' </quote>
and <quote> ` wildlife' <w> were dropped from the <mention> State List
</mention> and inserted in the <mention> concurrent list </mention> . </p>
<O> <&> page </&> 5 </O>

<h> <ul> SELECTIVE LIST OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#41:1>
Powers to legislate on industry, mines and minerals, oil fields,
fishing, inter-state rivers and river valleys have been assigned to the
Central Government under <mention> List-I </mention> , and further, it has
been authorised to social planning under <mention> concurrent list-III
</mention> of Schedule VII of the Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#42:1>
The State Government can also legislate on industry, mines and
minerals, fisheries, but subject to the provisions of the central
legislation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#43:1>
Exercising the powers conferred by the constitutions, the Central
Government has passed many laws.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#44:1>
Some of the main laws passed are as follows : </p>

<h> <ul> ROLE OF STATE POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#95:1>
The primary responsibility to contain and control the pollution
in the state lies with the State Pollution Prevention and Control Board.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#96:1>
The board has been entrusted to implement the pollution control laws.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#97:1>
No objection certificate ( NOC) is issued to the upcoming industries
by the board.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#98:1>
It also keeps a watch on conditions imposed <+> on the industries
</+> in the certificate and that the industries abide by the declared
<mention> emission and discharge </mention> standards.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#99:1>
Erring industries are prosecuted by the Pollution Board in the court
of law. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#100:1>
<h> <ul> LAW OF TORT AND INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#101:1>
It is said that the roots of environmental laws lies in <ul> the
tort of nuisance </ul> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#102:1>
<quote> " Nuisance is the unlawful interference with the use or
enjoyment of land or some right over or in connection with it." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#103:1>
Excessive smoke, bad smell, <}> <-> sonit </-> <+> <?> sonic </?>
</+> </}> sludge, noise vibration, noxious vapour which causes discomfort to
man <O> <&> page </&> 9 </O> or cause damage to vegetation or property is
nuisance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#104:1>
In such <-> a </-> cases the owner or occupier of the land on which
it originated is held liable to pay compensation to the <}> <-> aggreviated
</-> <+> aggrieved </+> </}> person.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#105:1>
Therefore, if any industry emits smoke or noxious fumes and vapour
it can be held liable for tort of nuisance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#106:1>
The owner of the <mention> Union Carbide ( Bhopal) Industry
</mention> was held liable under the Law of tort. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#107:1>
<h> <ul> THE INDIAN PENAL CODE AND POLLUTION </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#108:1>
Though the IPC, 1860, does not deal with any specific crimes
like industrial pollution, such cases have been dealt with is public
nusiance, under section 268 of the Code.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#109:1>
Section 278 of the Code also provides punishment for making
atmosphere noxious to health.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#110:1>
But the punishment provided for these offences is too meagre.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#111:1>
Therefore, the code could not pay an effective role to prevent and
control pollution Corollary to it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#112:1>
Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 also deals with
public nuisance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#113:1>
The Magistrate is empowered under this section to order the removal
of the nuisance who has caused it or can take necessary steps to prevent or
abate the nuisance.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#114:1>
Under the Section 133 of this Procedure Code, Metropolitan
Magistrate of Delhi ordered the closure of <mention> Shri Ram Food and
Fertiliser Industry </mention> when there was a leakage of oleum gas in the
year 1985. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 10 </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#115:1>
<h> <ul> THE PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE ACT, 1991 </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#116:1>
This benevolent piece of legislation was passed for providing
immediate relief to the persons affected by accident <}> <-> occuring </->
<+> occurring </+> </}> while handing any hazardous substances as matter
connected with these.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#117:1>
Now the Collector has been authorised to dispose of the claim for
relief within a period of three months from the date of the receipt of
application.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#118:1>
At the same time, it is not necessary for the claimant to prove that
the death, injury or damage was due to any wrongful act, or neglect or
default of any person.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#119:1>
This act provides security for the weaker sections of the society
especially workers and wage earners. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#120:1>
<h> <ul> THE RECOMMENDATION OF TIWARI COMMITTEE ( 1980) </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#121:1>
When the Congress ( I) came to power in 1980 general elections,
it immediately set up a committee under the Chairmanship fo Mr. N. D.
Tiwari to recommend legislative measures and administrative machinery to
ensure environmental protection.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#122:1>
The committee submitted its report on September 15, 1980 and made
<}> <-> for </-> <+> far </+> </}> reaching recommendations on administrative
and legislative measures for environment protection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#123:1>
A careful study of <mention> Tiwari Committee </mention>
suggests that the legislations passed so far are either inadequate or
defective in the following respects, thus : <O> <&> page </&> 11 </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#124:1>
1. They are not comprehensive in their approach.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#125:1>
2. They are fragmented, separated and segregated.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#126:1>
3. Controlling specific types of pollution rather than preserving
and protecting the environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#127:1>
4. Laws are cumbersome rather than streamlined, simple and
understandable to common man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#128:1>
5. Few of the laws are outdated. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#129:1>
Besides bringing these defects to the surface, the Committee
also recommended :

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#130:1>
1. The creation of a separate Department of Environment at the
Centre.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#131:1>
2. The creation of posts of Environmental Advisors in all the
ministries.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#132:1>
3. Constitution of a <quote> ` Cabinet Sub-Committee' </quote> on
the environment under the Chairmanship of Prime-Minister, and

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#133:1>
4. Review of Central and State laws on environmental management.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#134:1>
5. Public Awareness and Public Participation should be made two
major and key elements while making any environmental policy, planning or
management.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#135:1>
6. To enact, and have an umbrella legislation which should take care
of <+> the </+> entire problems of pollution under one <}> root. <-> <+> roof
</+> </}> </p> <O> <&> page </&> 12 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#136:1>
In order to fulfil the recommendations of the <mention> Tiwari
Committee </mention> , the separate Department of Environment, Forest and
Wild Life was created in 1985.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#137:1>
When Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi came to power he created two high power
agencies namely <mention> The National Waste Land Development Board ( NWLDB)
</mention> and <mention> The Central Ganga Authority ( CGA) </mention> to
tackle specific environmental problems.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#138:1>
Mr. Rajiv Gandhi was one with nature, fully devoted to the cause of
environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#139:1>
He was strongly of the view that come what may, we should never
compromise any thing at the cost of environment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#140:1>
Mr. Rajiv Gandhi noticed that inspite of number of legislations,
suitable provisions for conservation and enhancement of environment in
5th, 6th and 7th Five Year Plans, there seems a contining decline in the
quality of the environment, the Bhopal tragedy which killed more than 2,700
people and injured over 20,000 people, aggravated the problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#141:1>
To combat all these new Act in 1986 which is known as <mention> The
Environment ( Protection) Act </mention> came into force.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#142:1>
This was the first direct legislation passed by the Government of
India <}> <-> as </-> <+> on </+> </}> the basis of the <ul> resolutions
passed in 1972 at Stockholm </ul> at a <mention> world conference on Human
Environment. </mention> </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#143:1>
<h> <ul> SUSTAINABLE ALL ROUND DEVELOPMENT </ul> : </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-009#144:1>
Recently, Government of India has amended the <quote> ` Wild
Life Act' </quote> and notified a new <quote> ` Eco-Mark Scheme' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#145:1>
They have also made <ul> Environmental Audit </ul> mandatory for all
projects.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#146:1>
They <O> <&> page </&> 13 </O> have also established a <quote> ` Zoo
Authority of India' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#147:1>
Taking into consideration, the above legal provision, it seems that
Indian Government is well aware of the environmental degradation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#148:1>
However, there is lack of awareness of law even in educated as well
as uneducated people of our country.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#149:1>
Knowledge today is a major source of power and control.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#150:1>
The producers of knowledge are called <mention> researchers
</mention> and social sciences <}> <-> has </-> <+> have </+> </}> become a
full-fledged enterprise.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#151:1>
At one time it was thought that State was mainly concerned with
maintenance of law and order but such a restrictive role of the State is no
longer a valid concept.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#152:1>
The function of the law a country like India is not merely to solve
and adjust disputes, guide human conduct but also to achieve economic and
social justice.

<ICE-IND:W1A-009#153:1>
Thus, today, the law is that which sustains society. </I>
