<ICE-IND:S2A-068#1:1:A>
Just wait uh <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#2:1:B>
Ah ha make this Your Honour <,,> uhm <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#3:1:A>
Your Honour in this case the accused has been charged under
section three hundred and two of the Indian penal code <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#4:1:A>
In this case <,,> <&> clears throat </&> the case is principally of
<,,> this is a case of what is called <,> circumstantial evidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#5:1:A>
This is a case of circumstantial evidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#6:1:A>
In all matters <,,> the relevant definition is the definition of the
word prove <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#7:1:A>
The definition is the definition of the word prove <,,> and that
definition is always relevant <,> and <w> I'm </w> reading that definition
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#8:1:A>
<quote> A fact is said to be proved <,,> when after considering the
matters before it <,,> the court either believes it to exist <,,> or
considers its existence so probable <,,> that a prudent man ought <,,> under
the circumstances of the particular case <,> to act upon the supposition that
it exist </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#9:1:A>
In other words <,,> the definition of the word <,> prove in section
three of the Evidence Act <,,> is <-> a </-> standard which is officially
laid down <,,> for the purposes of highly given proof <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#10:1:A>
This was later adopted in one case to which I will not come in this
case I will come in a later case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#11:1:A>
Your Honour actually <,,> whether a given case is proved or not <,>
has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#12:1:B>
In general sense

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#13:1:A>
This <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#14:1:B>
In general sense <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#15:1:A>
This particular definition <,,> section three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#16:1:A>
Now section three <,,> relates to three types of evidence actually
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#17:1:A>
The evidence can be direct <,,> the evidence can be circumstantial
<,,> and the evidence can be partly circumstantial and partly direct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#18:1:A>
But the standard with reference to which <,,> the proof of a case
has got to be assessed <,,> is in section three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#19:1:A>
The standard with reference to which <,> the proof of a given case
has got to be assessed <,> is section three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#20:1:A>
On section three <,> as I said there are three types of evidence
<,,> direct <,,> circumstantial <,,> partly direct and partly circumstantial
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#21:1:A>
Now as regards circumstantial evidence <,,> the Supreme Court has
<,,> laid down certain guidelines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#22:1:A>
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation <,,> and not law
<,> that must be understood <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#23:1:A>
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation <,,> and not law
<,,> <w> they're </w> <,,> to be respected <,,> but they are not binding in
the sense in which <,,> the interpretation of law is binding <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#24:1:A>
They are to be respected <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#25:1:A>
The reason is this

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#26:1:B>
What is the citation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#27:1:A>
No <w> I'm I'm </w> coming to that citation is different <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#28:1:A>
Yes <.> ci </.> <,,> you know that <,> that is year nineteen sixty
Supreme Court page one nine zero <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#29:1:A>
I will give Your Honour later on <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#30:1:B>
Page <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#31:1:A>
One nine zero <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#32:1:A>
My god this <,> offence

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#33:1:B>
One nine zero

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#34:1:A>
Yes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#35:1:A>
Your Honour one nine five <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#36:1:A>
Decisions even of the highest court <,,> on questions which are
essential questions of facts <,,> cannot be called as precedents governing
the decisions of other cases <,,> which must rest <,> in the ultimate
analysis <,> upon their own particular facts <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#37:1:A>
The general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial
evidence <,,> are well established <,,> and <,,> the <,> and the broad <,>
and beyond doubt <,> or controversial <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#38:1:A>
The more difficult question is one of applying this principles to
the bare fact and circumstances <,,> of a particular case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#39:1:A>
Your Honour the point which we are trying to make out is <-> this
</-> <,,> those general principles are known <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#40:1:A>
What is necessary is <,,> actually <,,> both <,> application of
this particular principles <,> and taking the spirit of that particular
principles and not the literal words <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#41:1:A>
<w> I'll </w> come to that and explain <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#42:1:A>
From the first ever case <,,> after the birth of Supreme Court in
nineteen fifty-two <,> was what is called the <w> Hanumanta's </w> case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#43:1:A>
In year nineteen fifty-two Supreme Court page three forty-three

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#44:1:A>
Now here he is going to use it against me and I know it <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#45:1:C>
No no <w> it's </w> alright <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#46:1:B>
Continue it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#47:1:A>
Supreme Court <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#48:1:B>
On page <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#49:1:A>
Three four three <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#50:1:A>
That was the first ever <,,> Supreme Court case <,,> which laid
down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#51:1:A>
And what the Supreme Court in that particular case said was this
<,,> <quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#52:1:A>
The main three principles which were laid down there <,> in that
particular case were <,,> that the facts must <,,> be first established <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#53:1:A>
They <,,> must have what is called the conclusive tendency <,,> and
they must <,> be incompatable <,> with any other hypothesis <,,> except <,>
that of guilt <,> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#54:1:A>
These are the three basic principles which were laid down <,> in
<w> Hanumanta's </w> case <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#55:1:A>
And <,,> in the light of the principles which were laid down in <.>
Sup </.> by the Supreme Court <,> in that particular case <,> <&> clears
throat </&> we shall try to assess <,> whether in this case <,,> the facts
<,> cumulatively drive this particular court <,> to the conclusion that the
accused and the accused alone has committed that crime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#56:1:A>
Your Honour has followed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#57:1:A>
Now let us go through the first case <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#58:1:A>
So I will just <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#59:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#60:1:A>
Your Honour the first point is this <,,> P W six <,> and P W
seven <,,> were the office bearers <,,> of <,,> <w> Pushpavila's </w>
Co-operative Housing Society <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#61:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#62:1:A>
I have established <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#63:1:B>
Ah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#64:1:A>
Have established <,,> that on the twenty-seventh of July
nineteen ninety-one <,,> the accused <,> was functioning as a watchman of
that particular building <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#65:1:A>
One <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#66:1:A>
That is the first point <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#67:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#68:1:A>
And being a watchman <,,> and being on duty <,> from nine am
<-> on that </-> onwards <,,> he was expected to be on duty throughout the
day <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#69:1:B>
Expected to be duty on <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#70:1:A>
Throughout the day <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#71:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#72:1:A>
Number two <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#73:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#74:1:A>
Being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements
<,> of that building <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#75:1:A>
Now this is very important <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#76:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#77:1:A>
This is important for this reason <,,> that no lady who is all
by herself in a flat <,,> will open the flat to an outsider <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#78:1:A>
No lady <,,> who is all alone in the flat <,,> will open <,> the
flat to an outsider <,,> but will readily open it <,,> to a watchman <,,>
whose duty it is to protect them <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#79:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#80:1:A>
Third <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#81:1:A>
Since he was expected to be <,,> on duty <,,> throughout the day
<,,> he was expected to be <,> available <,> for <,> help <,,> after murder
<,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#82:1:C>
Not yet <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#83:1:B>
After <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#84:1:A>
Supposing he has not committed murder <,,> someone else has
committed murder <,,> and he is on duty <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#85:1:B>
So he was not here

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#86:1:A>
It is he who is supposed to help <,> that is what I am trying
to say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#87:1:A>
Being on duty <,,> he was expected to help <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#88:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#89:1:A>
Being a watchman <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#90:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#91:1:A>
He was not only <,,> not available <,,> but was missing <,>
and had to be traced <,,> through efforts <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#92:1:A>
Your next point <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#93:1:A>
He was not only not available <,,> but was missing <,,> and had to
be traced <,,> through efforts <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#94:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#95:1:A>
According to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society <,,>
according to P W seven <,,> who is the Chairman of the society <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#96:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#97:1:A>
This is at page twenty-three <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#98:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#99:1:A>
He was wearing <,,> that check shirt which is article seven on
that day <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#100:1:B>
<O> A few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#101:1:A>
When he was on duty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#102:1:A>
Both P W six and P W seven <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#103:1:B>
This is article <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#104:1:A>
Seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#105:1:A>
Article seven <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#106:1:A>
Your Honour this is very important <,> I will give the list
afterward <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#107:1:A>
Article seven <,,> was stained with <,,> group <,,> blood
<mention> A </mention> <,,> group <mention> A </mention> <,,> according to
the C A report <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#108:1:B>
What is uh <,> the group of uh <,> deceased <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#109:1:A>
<mention> A </mention> <,,> Your Honour blood group of
deceased was <mention> A </mention> because <,> according to exhibit
twenty-nine <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#110:1:B>
Yes <,> twenty-nine is a exhibit

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#111:1:A>
According to exhibit twenty-nine <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#112:1:B>
C A report

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#113:1:A>
C A report <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#114:1:A>
The <indig> saree </indig> the petticoat <,> the blouse <,> the
brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain <,> there are as many as <,,>
one two three four five <,> six items <,> which had <,,> <mention> A
</mention> group <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#115:1:A>
Your Honour may take it down <,> the <indig> saree </indig> <,>
article three <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#116:1:B>
Blouse <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#117:1:A>
The no no <w> we'll </w> go in order <,,> uh Your Honour <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#118:1:B>
<indig> Saree </indig> article three <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#119:1:A>
Petticoat article four <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#120:1:B>
Petticoat <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#121:1:A>
Blouse article five <,,> brassiere article six <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#122:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#123:1:A>
And curtain article two <,> all these items <,,> bore
<mention> A </mention> group <,,> and therefore I say <,> that the blood
group of the deceased was <mention> A </mention> although <,,> when the blood
<,> was <,,> taken and sent to the chemical analyser <,> independently <,> he
could not <,,> say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#124:1:B>
<indig> Saree </indig> was wet

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#125:1:A>
No no no <,,> the blood <,,> of the deceased was taken <,> by
the doctor <,> he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to
because perhaps <,> it had disintegrated <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#126:1:A>
It happens sometimes <,> that a given portion is disintegrated <,>
but I say

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#127:1:B>
Blood was taken

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#128:1:A>
Yes also taken <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#129:1:A>
But he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#130:1:A>
But I say that the deceased <,> had <mention> A </mention> group
by virtue of the fact that all these items had <mention> A </mention> group
has Your Honour followed this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#131:1:A>
This is at twenty-nine <,,> exhibit twenty-nine will show this
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#132:1:B>
Have you examine the group blood of the accused

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#133:1:A>
Yes that is also A <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#134:1:B>
That is

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#135:1:A>
<mention> A </mention> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#136:1:B>
That is also <mention> A </mention> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#137:1:A>
That is exactly I will let let me complete the argument <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#138:1:B>
One minute <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#139:1:A>
Your Honour the point is <,,> although the blood group of the
deceased <,> according to exhibit thirty-one <,,> thirty-one <,> is
<mention> A </mention> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#140:1:B>
Deceased <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#141:1:A>
No no accused <,,> accused his blood group <,> the blood
group of the accused is <mention> A </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#142:1:A>
The blood group of the deceased also is <mention> A </mention>
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#143:1:B>
According to this according to this you mean the <?> mark
<,,> this is therefore of </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#144:1:A>
Yes <,,> that is the blood of the <,> accused <,,> that is
<mention> A </mention> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#145:1:A>
I have taken care to ask <,> the police officer <,> at page
thirty-eight <,> para three <,> I have taken the special care <,> and <w>
I'll </w> read that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#146:1:A>
Earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one <,> we had sent the
accused to the hospital for obtaining blood <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#147:1:A>
When the accused was first arrested <,,> there were no injuries on
the person of the accused <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#148:1:A>
<w> That's </w> the point

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#149:1:A>
That is why this answer was taken <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#150:1:A>
Your Honour <w> I'm </w> very vigilant about my duties

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#151:1:B>
According to

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#152:1:A>
<w> I'm </w> very vigilant about my duties

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#153:1:B>
Have you established

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#154:1:A>
No no Your Honour <w> we'll </w> go to him later on I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#155:1:B>
<O> Two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#156:1:A>
Otherwise my link will be broken

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#157:1:B>
<O> Two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#158:1:A>
No no <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#159:1:B>
<O> Two words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#160:1:A>
Your Honour <w> I'm </w> not anxious to prove <,,> his blood
lying on the <indig> saree </indig> <w> I'm </w> anxious to prove his blood
lying on his own shirt <,> that is what <w> I'm </w> trying to say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#161:1:A>
He could have well pleaded that he was injured <,> and therfore he
could have well explained

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#162:1:B>
But both on

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#163:1:A>
No no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#164:1:B>
Whole circumstances uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#165:1:A>
No no no Your Honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole
thing will be <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#166:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#167:1:A>
Your Honour article seven had blood group <mention> A
</mention> <,,> since he was not injured <,,> and since he was wearing that
shirt <,,> the blood of the deceased has spurted on him <,> that is what <w>
I'm </w> trying to say <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#168:1:A>
The blood of the deceased had spurted on him <,> the blood of the
deceased has spurted on him on two items <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#169:1:A>
According to the exhibit twenty-nine <,,> let me just add <,,> and
it was here at page thirty-eight <,,> when he started the cross examination
<,> my learned friend should have asked the police officer <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#170:1:B>
Yes <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#171:1:A>
And cross examined this police officer on the point of there
being an injury <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#172:1:A>
He should have asked the police officer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#173:1:A>
And <,> he should have put the case <,> to the police officer that
the accused was also injured <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#174:1:A>
That is the main point in this case <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#175:1:A>
And he did not do that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#176:1:A>
Now the point which I am trying to make out there are two items on
which <,,> the blood group is <mention> A </mention> <,> article seven is one
<,> and article <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#177:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#178:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#179:1:B>
On article seven is a shirt

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#180:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#181:1:A>
Shirt no no <,> <w> we'll </w> forget Your Honour <,> the
deceased the blood on the deceased <w> we'll </w> forget because since she is
stabbed it is going to be full of blood <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#182:1:A>
We are trying to <,,> book him <,> and therefore the blood on him
is relevant <,> blood on the <indig> saree </indig> is not relevant at all it
is bound to be stained with blood <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#183:1:A>
Total there are fifteen injuries on the lady <,,> so that is that
presents more difficulty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#184:1:A>
The blood on the <indig> saree </indig> the blouse the petticoat
and it is bound to be there <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#185:1:A>
What about him <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#187:1:A>

He says he has have had

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-068#189:1:A>
No no no you don't help anybody when <w> I'm </w> <,,> <w>
I'm </w> addressing I don't do <,> you help yourself <,> I can take care of
myself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#190:1:A>
Your honour there are two items <,,> let it be very clear <,,>
there were two items on which <,,> the blood group <,,> on his person was <,>
<mention> A </mention> <,,> one is <,> this shirt which he was wearing on the
twenty-seventh <,> when he was on duty at that building <,> and when from
which he ran away <,> that is one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-068#191:1:A>
And the second is <,,> the shirt which he wore <,,> when he was
arrested at Bombay Central police station <,> and came back <,> and which was
taken <,> on the <.> mo </.> taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth
<,> which is article thirty-three <,,> </I>
