<h> <bold> <ul> Freedom of Press </ul> </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#2:1>
Press plays very important part in our life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#3:1>
It <}> <-> provide </-> <+> provides </+> </}> us newspaper which
gives us important & valuable news of all countries.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#4:1>
As we know that the word <quote> ` NEWS' </quote> can be derived from
North, East, West, South.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#5:1>
It means press gives us report of these <+> things </+> daily.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#6:1>
Press gives us news of sports, industries, agriculture, accidents,
achievement of our citizens, new establishment of company, firms,
cultural activity, investment & saving means, mainly about political <}> <->
contraversy </-> <+> controversy </+> </}> , leaders, businessman etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#7:1>
Every day each <}> <-> people was </-> <+> person is </+> </}>
thirsty for news & eager for information <-> would be deprived of </-> an
important medium which would communicate it <+> to </+> all of them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#8:1>
Press gives important current <}> <-> event </-> <+> events </+> </}>
of world, country, <indig> Taluka </indig> , district, etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#9:1>
Editors express their views in a very forceful language <}> <-> though
</-> <+> through </+> </}> newspaper provided to us by press.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#10:1>
In press, there are also other <}> <-> writters </-> <+> writers </+>
</}> who have made an indepth study of particular issues & who gives us their
considered views on subjects concerned.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#11:1>
<}> <-> Sport </-> <+> Sports </+> </}> page is also an absorbing
reading, gives us accurate news about <}> <-> in </-> <+> the </+> </}> world
around.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#12:1>
Press has a very ancient past in this country & a very tradition of
journalism. <del> for </del> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#13:1>
For industrial & commercial firms, press is an important channel
of advertisement.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#14:1>
Couples intending to get <}> <-> merried </-> <+> married </+> </}> &
wishing to insert <+> an </+> advertisement in newspaper would also be
advantageous of press.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#15:1>
Press also <}> <-> provide </-> <+> provides </+> </}> us sensational
news or reports from crimes, murder, robberies, rapes which makes us very
depressed by reading but gives us cynical view of human nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#16:1>
I think that there is a great freedom to press as press can
freely <}> <-> dispose </-> <+> divulge </+> </}> any secret matters about
politicians, ministers, actors, directors, industrialists, scientists,
archaeologist <}> <-> wheather </-> <+> whether </+> </}> the <}> <->
secreats </-> <+> secrets </+> </}> may be good or bad, advantageous or
depressing <+> . </+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#17:1>
Press also tells us about <}> <-> boliwood </-> <+> bollywood </+>
</}> stars, sportsman.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#18:1>
But for collecting all this information about various parts of world
press <}> <-> reports has </-> <+> reporters have </+> </}> to take very
great efforts.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#19:1>
They have to make travel to various cities, world countries etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#20:1>
Though there is freedom to press in various matters but there are
obviously some restrictions must be there on press.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#21:1>
It is in the pockets of rich people.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#22:1>
So big <}> <-> businessman, </-> <+> businessmen </+> </}> mainly
politicians, <}> <-> industrialist </-> <+> industrialists </+> </}> make use
of press by purchasing them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#23:1>
Therefore, they publish wrongful information also to save themselves
& to put others in difficulty.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#24:1>
It is right that freedom is given to press to publish & expose all
<}> <-> secreates </-> <+> secrets </+> </}> of politicians but they are
somewhere, restricted <+> for </+> e.g. <}> <-> took </-> <+> take </+> </}>
the case of <quote> ` Hawala' </quote> racket.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#25:1>
In this racket, when CBI says that BJP is involved in <quote> `
Hawala' </quote> then the press purchased by <}> <-> congress </-> <+>
Congress </+> </}> make too much comments on BJP in the newspaper & tried to
show how <}> <-> congress </-> <+> Congress </+> </}> is pure & <}> <->
non-corruptional </-> <+> uncorrupted </+> </}> like <quote> ` river Ganga'
</quote> & in the same way in other newspaper BJP also make & pass the same
comment on <}> <-> congress </-> <+> Congress </+> </}> & <}> <-> try </->
<+> tried </+> </}> to show <}> <-> clearity </-> <+> clearly the integrity
</+> </}> of their group as elections came nearer.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#26:1>
But at least there will be freedom to press to expose the names of
other politicians & <}> <-> industrialist </-> <+> industrialists </+>
</}> involved in <quote> ` Hawala racket' </quote> & like other news.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#27:1>
Press also publishes about activity of Tamil militants & <}> <->
Srilanka. </-> <+> Sri Lanka. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#28:1>
It also exposes our <}> <-> prime minister </-> <+> Prime Minister
</+> </}> about <quote> ` Hawala racket' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#29:1>
It also gives information about <quote> ` <indig> Chandanchor
Virappan' </indig> </quote> in Karnataka.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#30:1>
These are some of the merits of press. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#31:1>
Apart from this, there are some demerits of press also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#32:1>
<}> <-> Sometime </-> <+> Sometimes </+> </}> , press can publish
some wrong information also it <}> <-> hearts </-> <+> hurts </+> </}> the
prestige of some people of high status.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#33:1>
Every day when we started to read the newspaper there are majority
<}> <-> no. </-> <+> number </+> </}> of news from accidents, murder, suicide
<}> <-> etc </-> <+> etc., </+> </}> which makes us very depressed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#34:1>
Press has given such a freedom that it can expose any wrong &
confusing news <+> . </+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#35:1>
So press must have some type of restrictions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#36:1>
I think press has given <}> <-> undefinite </-> <+>
indefinite </+> </}> & unrestricted freedom is given to press for giving
all kinds of news from <}> <-> alover </-> <+> all over </+> </}> the
country. <&> incomplete sentence </&>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#37:1>
It is important from point of <}> <-> industrialist </-> <+>
industrialists </+> </}> to give advertisement about their products & young
students to give <}> <-> application </-> <+> applications </+> </}> for job
in <}> <-> newspaper </-> <+> newspapers </+> </}> in response to an
advertisement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#38:1>
Press can make best to their efforts to provide us valuable
information of important <}> <-> happening </-> <+> happenings </+> </}> of
the world today.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#39:1>
But it is my <}> <-> advise </-> <+> advice </+> </}> to press that
they <}> <-> could </-> <+> should </+> </}> not allow other persons to
purchase them by money by rich persons.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#40:1>
I want to <}> <-> thanks to </-> <+> thank the </+> </}> press for
providing us valuable & rich information.</p> </I>

<h> <bold> <ul> Should Mothers Go to Work </ul> ? </bold> </h>

<p> If sometimes mothers go away from us we <}> <-> fells </-> <+> feel </+>
</}> helpless.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#42:2>
Because for every purpose we want mother.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#43:2>
Mother is our birth giver.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#44:2>
Without mother we can't <}> <-> Came </-> <+> Come </+> </}> into the
world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#45:2>
Without mother our <-> any </-> work is not to be done.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#46:2>
For each purpose, each work, each cause we want mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#47:2>
When mothers go to work we are <del> because </del> alone.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#48:2>
We think that mother should not go to work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#49:2>
Every moment we want her.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#50:2>
For small purposes we <del> agre </del> depend<del>ed</del> upon our
mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#51:2>
To day mothers <del> are </del> are free.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#52:2>
Society has given them equal staus.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#53:2>
But once upon a time there was no freedomf for women<del>s</del>.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#54:2>
They can't learn<del>ed</del> in the school.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#55:2>
Only men were allowed to go to <del> Schcool </del> School and <-> to
</-> learn.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#56:2>
Women lived only in house.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#57:2>
They should not come outside. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#58:2>
Only cook <-> only </-> and have to <del> pay </del> take care
<}> <-> to </-> <+> of </+> </}> their children<del> s </del> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#59:2>
There was no choice without it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#60:2>
They didn't learn <}> <-> into </-> <+> in a </+> </}> school. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#61:2>
Then some time after, a great man, Mahatma Jyotiba Fule <del> was
</del> hated this type of situation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#62:2>
He <}> <-> neglected </-> <+> ignored </+> </}> this type of
tradition.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#63:2>
They wanted to teach women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#64:2>
But society haven't given them this type <+> of </+> rights.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#65:2>
But he started firstly his wife Savitribai Fule.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#66:2>
When she learned <+> herself </+> she started teaching girls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#67:2>
There was revolution in women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#68:2>
Then slowly women<del>s</del> liberation started.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#69:2>
They are <}> <-> reveluting with </-> <+> rvolting against </+> </}>
men in every field.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#70:2>
They <}> <-> shown </-> <+> showed </+> </}> us that they are not
<mention> down with </mention> with men.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#71:2>
Thus revolution <-> is </-> going <-> to </-> on. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#72:2>
But in revolutionary time some bad effects were going on.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#73:2>
Mother and Father go to work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#74:2>
They leave their children<del>s</del> in house.
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#> When mother &
father go to work children were <del> became </del> alone.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#75:2>
Any one was not there with them for speaking. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#76:2>
They <}> <-> thought </-> <+> think </+> </}> that when mother
and father <del> were </del> return <-> to </-> home they can enjoy with
them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#77:2>
But when mother and father come <-> to </-> home they were so <}> <->
tierd </-> <+> tired </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#78:2>
There was no time <}> <-> for </-> <+> to </+> </}> speak with the
chieldren<del>s</del>.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#79:2>
So that <-> of </-> they didn't give<del>n</del> any attention to the
children. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#80:2>
For this cause children became lonely.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#81:2>
They became <?> risky </?> and alone from their parents.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#82:2>
They became angry <}> <-> on </-> <+> with </+> </}> their mother.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#83:2>
They hate them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#84:2>
They didn't like that their mother <del> go </del> should live with
them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#85:2>
Children<del>s</del> wanted that mother should care about them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#86:2>
But mother <del> can't </del> couldn't leave her work. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#87:2>
Some <}> <-> womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> go to work for
family needs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#88:2>
And some <}> <-> womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> go to work <del> for
</del> to show <}> <-> proud </-> <+> pride </+> </}> in society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#89:2>
But for their working children<del>s</del> become bad.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#90:2>
They are going on making bad <}> <-> things </-> <+> habits </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#91:2>
They also go <+> in </+> for <-> taking </-> drugs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#92:2>
Some children<del>s</del> do not learn <}> <-> neatly </-> <+>
properly </+> </}> in School.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#93:2>
They go on failing <}> <-> .Because </-> <+> because </+> </}> no one
was there to care about them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#94:2>
If the child asks money to their parents they give money without
checking for what purpose he wants money.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#95:2>
So the<del>y</del> children became <}> <-> bad </-> <+> spoilt </+>
</}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#96:2>
So there are bad effects of them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#97:2>
But when mother found that her child is ina bad <}> <-> condition
</-> <+> company </+> </}> there was no time.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#98:2>
In <+> the </+> past <}> <-> womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> should
only care about her family and children <-> . </-> and men should work to
earn money only <del> .and prevent </del> and take care of his family.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#99:2>
So mother <del> was </del> had <del> a </del> <+> no </+> time to <+>
take </+> care of her child. </p>

<p> <del> But today that condition was not normal. Society is processing.
Womans revolting. They want freedom. </del> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#100:2>
<del> Th </del> But <}> <-> womans </-> <+> women </+> </}> also
take care to their children<del>s</del> with working. <del> How </del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#101:2>
<}> <- > Woman's </-> <+> <w> women's </w> </+> </}> <}> <->
revoluting </-> <+> revolution </+> </}> like men<del>s</del>.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#102:2>
Men also have to work like women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#103:2>
Men have to help <-> to </-> women.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#104:2>
When mother is not in house father would have to take care of
children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#105:2>
Father would have to look after the children<del>s</del> that what
they do in absence of parents.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#106:2>
They ask about it to them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#107:2>
Mother would also have to look after children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#108:2>
Without working only would have to give more and more importance to
the children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#109:2>
Mother would take care of the children with working also. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#110:2>
Today also people haven't like that woman would work because
they think that any one would not care about her house & children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#111:2>
So <del> morely </del> woman don't work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#112:2>
So one question <}> <-> raise </-> <+> arises </+> </}> that mothers
should go to work ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#113:2>
But <del> t </del> she should work also.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#114:2>
From this question she <}> <-> have </-> <+> has </+> </}> to come
out.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#115:2>
Because <}> <-> anything is not </-> <+> nothing is </+> </}>
possible in <+> the </+> world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#116:2>
Sometimes we <}> <-> thought </-> <+> think </+> </}> that something
is <del> im</del>possible, but it is hard but not impossible. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#117:2>
In house <del> whom </del> when mother is learned, literate
<del> then </del> her children<del>s</del> <}> <-> were </-> <+> are </+>
</}> also intelligent.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#118:2>
So women have to learn & work for our scociety.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#119:2>
And for <del> to </del> <+> that </+> show the society she <+> also
</+> have <+> to </+> work. </I>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#121:3>
Science is systematical knowledge passed down from generation to

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#122:3>
At times it has taken the form of a search for truth, at others it
has been translated in to technology <-> . </-> - -

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#123:3>
Science and technology, together, have brought about sea- <}> <->

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#124:3>
The <}> <-> chang </-> <+> change </+> </}> has been in a large - -

humanity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#125:3>
The science gives us lot up advantages and also lot <}> <-> up

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#126:3>
Specially we look to advantages <+> particularly </+> the science is
very <del> usful </del> useful to us.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#127:3>
Thanks to science we have many marvellous machines which have taken
the drudgery out of work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#128:3>
<}> <-> Factorioes </-> <+> Factories </+> </}> have made a variety

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#130:3>
Our advanced - - technology has helped us in better management of

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#131:3>
<}> <-> In </-> <+> On the </+> </}> other hand the progress in

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#132:3>
Science has created madicines which can prevent or cure - - dreaded

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#133:3>
It has increased our life span and has made our lives pain-free.

It has given us miraculous <}> <-> oprational </-> <+> operational

Science has <}> <-> revolutinized </-> <+> revolutionised </+> </}>
every aspect of our life, whether it be agriculture, the home, entertainment,

But this only one <}> <-> said </-> <+> sad </+> </}> of the story.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#137:3>

The main thing is todays <}> <-> parsons </-> <+> persons </+> </}>

</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#139:3>
When we try to think in a <}> <-> diffarent viw </-> <+>

There is lot <}> <-> up </-> <+> of </+> </}> <del> - </del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#141:3>
The two world wars, the Vietnam war, the Gulf war have shown how
destructive science can be.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#142:3>
Atom bombs, guided missiles, <}> <-> chamical </-> <+> chemical </+>
</}> and biological weapons, even long <}> <-> rang </-> <+> range </+> </}>
star-war technology have taken mankind to the brink of a global distructions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#143:3>
The increase in materialism and the lack of spirituality have
distroyed the mental and physical health of man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#144:3>
<}> <-> Entartentment </-> <+> Entertainment </+> </}> has
degenerated to the level of the cheap and the vulgur and mean has become too.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#145:3>
Superficial and bereft of human values. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-004#146:3>
Factories and the use of machines have led to pollution of air,
water and land.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#147:3>
Indiscriminate and prolonged use of fertilizers has led to the <}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#148:3>
Quicker means of transport have increased the frequency of
accidents.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#149:3>
There has been a steep rise in population due to the decrease in
infant mortality and death rates.

<ICE-IND:W1A-004#150:3>
