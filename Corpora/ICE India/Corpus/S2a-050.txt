<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#1:1:A>
Back to our <,,> I S L M model that we had <,> discontinued
<,,> last week <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#2:1:A>
And uh <,,> a continuation part of it <,,> is the second set of the
market <,,> and that was the <,,> monitary sector <,,> equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#3:1:A>
And when we come to this already we have seen <,,> how the real
sector <,,> reaches to its equilibrium position <,,> and the result of which
is <,,> the I S curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#4:1:A>
<w> We've </w> drawn the I S curve also <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#5:1:A>
Now here we come to <,,> this L M curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#6:1:A>
The equilibrium <,> in the monetary sector <,> would ultimately give
diagramatically <,> the L M curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#7:1:A>
And why L M as we know well <,> L is liquidity <,> M is <,> money
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#8:1:A>
Now <,> following almost the same pattern of explanation <,> as we
did in case of I S curve <,> we can very well present this whole thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#9:1:A>
But initially <,,> the proposition is <,,> that the monitary sector
equilibrium <,,> is reached <,,> at the rate of interest <,,> at which <,,>
money supply <,,> equals <,> money demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#10:1:A>
A very simple kind of an identity <,,> you can <,,> take into
account here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#11:1:A>
Its a situation wherein <,,> money supply would be equal to <,,>
money demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#12:1:A>
So this equality between money supply and money demand <,> is the
condition of equilibrium here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#13:1:A>
To put <,> briefly then <,,> M S <,> H to indicate supply of money
<,,> is equal to <,,> M <,> D small <,,> letter of capital letter <,,> and
this we say is the condition of equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#14:1:A>
And this will be our first equation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#15:1:A>
First equation very simple thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#16:1:A>
And now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we
progress <,,> would be by and large <,,> within the <?> Keyntian </?>
framework <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#17:1:A>
Almost <,,> much closer to <,,> your explanation of tension
liquidity preference theory of interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#18:1:A>
Much of that <,> is adopted here <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#19:1:A>
So the matters become quite simple for us <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#20:1:A>
For example as we did last time left side <,> right hand side <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#21:1:A>
Now what determines the money supply <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#22:1:A>
We <+> have </+> already given an answer to this <,,> when we
discussed tension theory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#23:1:A>
What determines the money supply <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#24:1:B>
The state of reputation <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#25:1:A>
<w> It's </w> the monetary who determines <,> the monetary
authority <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#26:1:A>
So money supply is determined by <,,> the monetary authority <,,>
<&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#27:1:A>
And it is because of this <,,> we will not be able to get <,> any
equation <,,> so far as money supply is concerned <,,> because there is <,,>
no set formula for determining money supply at a time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#28:1:A>
That is just on the basis of the <,> needs of the time <,,> that
the monetary authority <,> goes on contracting or expanding the money supply
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#29:1:A>
One side is open <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#30:1:A>
And therefore now <,> for the rest of the thing <,,> every emphasis
will be placed on the demand side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#31:1:A>
Now when you come to the demand side of money <,,> this demand is
determined by <,,> <&> B B writing </&> by <,,> the tension method <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#32:1:A>
Three motives <,,> three motives <,,> <indig> haan </indig> <,,>
<w> we'll </w> put in general say by the three motives <,,> <&> B B writing
</&> which govern <,,> liquiditive preference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#33:1:A>
And we follow this particular line <,,> <O> cough </O> uh when you
say <,,> after three motives we group together <,,> say in general say
transactions <,,> and precautionary motives <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#34:1:A>
Now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive <,>
say broadly <,> they will be <,,> calling it as transactions motive <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#35:1:A>
Both are combined together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#36:1:A>
Now when you take into consideration this one <,,> this
transactions motive <,,> that is liquidity preference for transaction motive
<,> depends on <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#37:1:C>
Level of <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#38:1:D>
Level of income

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#39:1:A>
Level of income <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#40:1:A>
It depends on level of income <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#41:1:A>
Now <,> in tension language <,,> this transactions demand for <,,>
money <,,> is indicated by the term <,,> M Y <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#42:1:A>
Level of income <,> is Y <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#43:1:A>
Therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression <,>
means say M-one <,,> is <,,> a function of <,,> income <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#44:1:A>
M-one <,> is a function of income <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#45:1:A>
Now this is <,,> second equation that you are able to get <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#46:1:A>
So one part of the total money <,> demand <,> is taken care of <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#47:1:A>
Then you come to the second part of it <,> and that is <,,> what
comes now <,,> ?

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#48:1:E>
Speculate

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#49:1:A>
Speculative demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#50:1:A>
Now speculative <,> demand for money <,,> <&> B B writing </&> this
depends on <,,> ?

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#51:1:F>
Rate of interest <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#52:1:A>
Correct <,,> it depends on rate of interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#53:1:A>
And therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as
M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#54:1:A>
The notation M-two has been used by Kens <,,> and therefore <,> we
put in that M-two <,,> is <,,> a function of <,,> you can use any notation to
indicate function F or K <,> anything <,> is a function of R <,,> that is the
third impression <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#55:1:A>
What we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity
preference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#56:1:A>
And <w> it's </w> mostly that which Hicks and Henson have used <,,>
in order to give us <,> the monetary sector equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#57:1:A>
Now given this two things equations two and three <,,> now <,,>
what we know <,,> that M <,> D that <,,> demand <,> is equal to <,> M-one
plus M-two <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#58:1:A>
This is what we know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#59:1:A>
If that is so <,,> given this therefore we can say <,> to put this
in <,> equilibrium one <,> or this condition of equilibrium <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#60:1:A>
So we can say then <,> that substituting <,,> <&> B B writing </&>
in <,,> substituting <,> two and three <,,> in equation one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#61:1:A>
This and this we would be substituting in equation one <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#62:1:A>
Therefore we say money supply is equal to <,,> let us initially put
M money demand <,,> just derivation every step I would like to put before you
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#63:1:A>
And M D is uhm one plus M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#64:1:A>
And we know that M-one <,> is a function of Y <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#65:1:A>
So instead of M-one <,,> if you put in or substitute <,> F Y <,>
its a function of Y <,> that is income <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#66:1:A>
And n place of M-two <,,> put K R its function of rate of interest
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#67:1:A>
So this <w> you're </w> able to get <,> ultimately <,> that money
supply <,> is <,,> <.> equa </.> <,> function of Y <,> plus a function of
rate of interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#68:1:A>
This becomes <,,> your equation number four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#69:1:A>
As we derived <,,> fourth equation <,> in case of the real sector
equilibrium <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#70:1:A>
And once you come this <,,> this is <,> the equation of <,,> L M
curve <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#71:1:A>
This is the equation of L M curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#72:1:A>
So in a simple way we have derived these four equations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#73:1:A>
Just see the stage by which we have progressed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#74:1:A>
We began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or
money sector <,> would be establishd <,,> at the rate of interest at which
<,,> money supply is equal to money demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#75:1:A>
Money supply is determined by the monetary authority <,> at any
given time <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#76:1:A>
Money demand <,> is determined by liquidity preference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#77:1:A>
So you will find here the L comes here <,> and the M comes on the
other side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#78:1:A>
The right hand side of this equation is all <,> liquidity feature
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#79:1:A>
The left hand side is the money feature <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#80:1:A>
And therefore liquidity money <,> they are the two dimensions which
are used <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#81:1:A>
In case of liquidity <,,> the transactions demand for money <,>
M-one <,,> is determined by income level <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#82:1:A>
So M-one is a function of Y <,> income <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#83:1:A>
Whereas the speculative demand for money M-two <,,> depends on R
<,> rate of interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#84:1:A>
And therefore M-two is a function of R <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#85:1:A>
Naturally substitute these two in one <,> and ultimately you have
come to this part <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#86:1:A>
So as I said <,> the left part denotes M <,> money supply <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#87:1:A>
The right part <,> determines L <,> the liquidity preference <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#88:1:A>
And therefore <,> this is an equation of liquidity and money <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#89:1:A>
In graphical terms <,> it is described as L M curve <,> liquidity
money curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#90:1:A>
So again <,,> you find that this part is so easy to present <,,>
because it is nothing but <,> a repetition of tension presentation <,> by and
large <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#91:1:A>
What you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#92:1:A>
The same part is used <,> <w> we've </w> put in terms of four
equations <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#93:1:A>
Now once we have done this basic exercise <,,> then we go to draw
<,> the diagram <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#94:1:A>
And since there are four equations by which we are putting this
<,,> we again follow the four diagraphic chart <,> for coming to <,> the L M
curve <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#95:1:A>
And therefore in this case <,,> again <w> I'll </w> suggest you to
take a <,,> full page <,,> for the diagram <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#96:1:A>
The four <,> diagrams we will be drawing <,,> side by side <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#97:1:A>
As usual we <,,> take up <,,> one two three four <,,> in an <,,>
anti-clock fashion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#98:1:A>
And the direction <,,> would be the same as we have now notice <,,>
you start from diagram one reach to diagram two <,,> then come to diagram
three <,> and from three you come downwards to diagram four <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#99:1:A>
Now to begin with in case of uh <,> the first diagram <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#100:1:A>
We begin with <,> the speculative demand for money <,> M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#101:1:A>
The first diagram begins with M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#102:1:A>
So on X-axis you measure M-two <,,> which means <,,> speculative
demand for money <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#103:1:A>
And then on Y-axis what would come <,,> ?

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#104:1:F>
Rate of interest

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#105:1:A>
Rate of interest <,> R would be there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#106:1:A>
Now <,> we would follow the same technique as we did last time
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#107:1:A>
Taking numerical scales <,,> because the matters become very
simple for our understanding <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#108:1:A>
Just <,> the usual <,> figures perhaps <w> I've </w> taken <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#109:1:A>
Now again the second stage that we follow is to have <,,> the
vertical and horizontal faint lines <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#110:1:A>
So that the graph sheet would be ready <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#111:1:A>
And we know here <,> the relationship between <,,> the speculative
demand for money <,> and the rate of interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#112:1:A>
Is it positive or negative <,,> ?

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#113:1:G>
Negative <,>

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#114:1:H>
Negative

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#115:1:A>
Negative <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#116:1:A>
So <,> M-two <,,> is negative function of the rate of interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#117:1:A>
That is what <,> we note in this case also <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#118:1:A>
If at all you can add this particular no <,> E it is <,> L
negative function <,,> M-two <,> is a negative function of <,,> R <,,> the
rate of interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#119:1:A>
They have a negative relationship <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#120:1:A>
So naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose
eight percent <,,> quite high <,,> the speculative demand can be just hundred
<,,> a quite low demand <,,> for speculative purposes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#121:1:A>
If it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go
up to two hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#122:1:A>
You move to the right <,,> on X-axis <,> as you come down on
Y-axis <,> lower the rate of interest <,> more the demand for speculative
purpose <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#123:1:A>
So rate of interest if it comes down to six percent <,,> you have
demand three hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#124:1:A>
If it comes to five percent demand is four hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#125:1:A>
And if it comes to four percent <,> say demand is five percent
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#126:1:A>
And we join these points <,,> get a curve <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#127:1:A>
Now this curve can be described as a curve for M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#128:1:A>
M- two curve <,,> and if you wish to write here the <,,> demand
functions speculative demand function M-two <,> is a function of <,> rate of
interest <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#129:1:A>
So you have taken care of equation number three here <,,> that is
represented well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#130:1:A>
Now from there you pass on to equation number uh <,> the diagram
number two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#131:1:A>
And as you know that <,> the usual way of drawing <,> that
whatever is presented on X-axis in diagram number one <,> will be repeated on
X-axis in diagram number two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#132:1:A>
And therefore <,> in this diagram <,> you will have M-two
represented <,> on X-axis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#133:1:A>
So <w> let's </w> first have <,,> the scale of M-two <,,>
transfered to this <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#134:1:A>
And <w> let's </w> have the <,,> vertical lines drawn <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#135:1:A>
So here <,,> you have the speculative demand <,,> or money <,,>
<&> B B writing </&> transfered here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#136:1:A>
Now this second diagram <,,> will take care of the <,> equality
identity <,,> money supply equal to money demand <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#137:1:A>
But this identity will represent not simply by saying <quote>
Money supply equal to money demand <,,> but that we would be taking <,> with
the help of one which was here <,> money demand <-> was </-> <,> is equal to
<,> M-one plus M-two <,,> </quote>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#138:1:A>
And that <,,> part we will be taking money demand equal to M-one
<,> plus M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#139:1:A>
And here we assume its certain <,,> total money demand <,> which
means money supply <,> it equals money supply <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#140:1:A>
Suppose here we assume <,,> that money demand <,> which means
money supply also <,> is five hundred <indig> crores </indig> of <indig>
rupees </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#141:1:A>
If we presume this <,,> then <,,> this graph what would come on
the vertical <,,> part of this diagram <,,> ?

<$H> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#142:1:H>
<w> It's </w> N <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#143:1:A>
No <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#144:1:A>
You have to concentrate only on that equation <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#145:1:A>
If <,> on X-axis you are able and you have taken <,,> speculative
demand for money that is M-two <,,> what would come <,> ?

<$I> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#146:1:I>
Rate of interest

<$J> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#147:1:J>
Rate of interest <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#148:1:A>
Where comes the rate of interest in this equation <,,> ?

<$K> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#149:1:K>
<O> One word </O> <,,>

<$L> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#150:1:L>
Its <O> two words </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#151:1:A>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#152:1:A>
This has to be understood correctly and properly <,,> because <,,>
this can be <,> an accidence for for any <,> any person <,> while drawing the
diagram <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#153:1:A>
Other things would follow very automatically <,,> <&>
interruptions </&> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#154:1:A>
No income business should be there <,> no rate of interest should
be there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#155:1:A>
Supply of money is equal to demand for money <,,> and demand for
money is broken into two parts M-one plus M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#156:1:A>
If one axis takes care of M-two <,,> the other axis must take care
of <,> ?

<$M> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#157:1:M>
M-one <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#158:1:A>
M-one <,> <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#159:1:A>
See how it comes <w> I'll </w> explain to you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#160:1:A>
But let us put this and have <,> the diagram ready for drawing
this one <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#161:1:A>
Say M-one which represents <,> now you are coming to equation
number two <,,> which is an equation of M-one <,,> uhm

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#162:1:A>
And <,> you are bringing in M-one plus M-two both together <,>
which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#163:1:A>
So that identity can be represented this way <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#164:1:A>
Let us first go for this scale <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#165:1:A>
We follow the same <,> numbers here <,,> easy way to put in <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#166:1:A>
You can use any numbers <,,> <&> B B writing </&>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#167:1:A>
But normally I presume in all classes that the students know
number <,,> upto ten maximum one to ten <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#168:1:A>
So that very easy to go with single digits <,,> if at all a class
like yours is there I presume that you know numbers upto hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#169:1:A>
Uh because calculations orally become very easy

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#170:1:A>
The whole thing is that <,> what figures you take <,> do not
matter <,> what this hundred means <,> it can be hundred <indig> rupees
</indig> <,,> it can be hundred <indig> crore </indig> of <indig> rupees
</indig> hundred million of <indig> rupees </indig> <,> whatever you can put
into bracket <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#171:1:A>
So how much amount you put in it <,> is immaterial that <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#172:1:A>
So let us have the horizontal line <,,> to get the <,> points
corresponding to <,> X and Y axis <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#173:1:A>
Now let us see how this comes into <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#174:1:A>
We have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#175:1:A>
And this total demand for money is M-one plus M-two <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#176:1:A>
Now <,,> given this M D equal to five hundred <,,> if I give you
<,,> an amount equal to M-two <,,> I think you can do some subtraction <,>
and find out the value of M-one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#177:1:A>
Now let us go this way <,> that <,,> given that <,,> if M-two is
hundred <,,> what will be M-one ?

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#178:1:C>
Four hundred

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-050#179:1:A>
Four hundred you know subtraction very well <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#180:1:A>
Then <,> <.> sub </.> herein comes the first point <,,> that both
together will make up five hundred <indig> rupees </indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#181:1:A>
So <,> M-two is hundred <,,> and therefore remaining is <,,> M-one
is four hundred <,,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-050#182:1:A>
The transactions demand for money <,,> </I>
