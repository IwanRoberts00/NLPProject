<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#5:1>
The industrial revolution brought the comforts to the mankind in
abundance but at the same time this brought with it miseries and discomforts
to mankind as well.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#6:1>
The alarming increase in the population in India, increased the
need of various commodities in large quantities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#7:1>
Man is a nonseparable and dependent part of nature.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#8:1>
Man has substantial influence over nature too and, therefore, he
derives all his food, clothing, shelter and other needs from nature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#9:1>
The <mention> air </mention> , <mention> water </mention> ,
<mention> soil </mention> , <mention> plants </mention> and <mention> trees
</mention> , <mention> animals </mention> , etc., all constitute the
environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#10:1>
These constituents keep on interacting with each other to maintain a
mutual balance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#11:1>
This mutual balance is called the <quote> <mention> ` ecological
balance' </mention> </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#12:1>
The use of nature, for fulfilling the requirements of man, by man
causes certain changes in the environment and thus the ecological
imbalances.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#13:1>
If population is small, the effect on the environment is also
proportionally small provided the other conditions remain unchanged.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#14:1>
In developing countries, like ours, where the process of development
puts a severe strain on the environment, the increase of population also
adds a lot to the environmental strain.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#15:1>
The emphasis of all the dedeveloping countries is on the economic
development and normally this leads to generation of wastes in solid, liquid,
and gaseous forms and the deterioration of the living environment.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#16:1>
During the early stages of industrialisation, the environmental
impacts of indstrial effluents did not pose any problems because the
limited pace of development.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#17:1>
With the increasing rate of industrial development and the
populaation explosion, the environmental damage became a growing concern
to people in general and to environmental lists in particular or rather it
has become a global problem.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#18:1>
More it has beome a mandatory requirement of every mankind to help in
controlling it.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#19:1>
It is essential to understand the magnitude of the task confronting
the developing world to maintain the cleanliness of the environment, while
keeping up the pace of industrialisation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#20:1>
<h> <bold> MAGNITUDE OF DUST POLLUTION OF AIR </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#21:1>
<quote> <mention> ` Good quality of life' </mention> </quote>
essentially indicate minimum supply or availability of food, cloth and
shelter to all of us as per old concept.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#22:1>
Now <quote> <mention> ` good quality of life' </mention> </quote>
literally means availability of clean air, fresh water, noise free
environment, better communication and transportation system, better
medical facilities, etc., besides other needs of life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#23:1>
The amount of air breathed and the oxygen consumed vary with the task
performed and with the <w> individual's </w> size.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#24:1>
Normal frequency of breathing in adults at rest ranges from 10 to
24 breaths / min and the volume of air moved in or out of lungs with each
breath is about 500 cc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#25:1>
The minute ventilation which is the volume of air moved in or out of
lungs in 1 min ranges from 6 to 10 lit / min for normal resting subjects at
sea level.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#26:1>
The inspiratory and expiratory phases are not exactly same, but
practically it may be considered each as taking half the time required for a
complete respiratory cycle.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#27:1>
Thus with a minute volume ( insipiratory) of 6 - 10 lit of air and
this 6 - 10 lit of air will be inspirated in half time only which implies
that the actual inspiration is at the rate of 12 - 20 lit / min, that is the
inhalation rate of air is quite high.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#28:1>
If a little volume, that is 1 lit / min of oxygen is required for
some work than about 20.25 lit / min voume of air ( volume at 15 <*>
degrees</*>C and 760 mm pressure of mercury ) would be required to breath
in.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#29:1>
Normally an average human breathes about 11,500 lit of air ( volume
at 15 <*> degrees</*>C and 760 mm pressure of mercury) every day.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#30:1>
This clearly indicates how large amount of pollutants are being
inhaled by our body daily.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#31:1>
As reported ambient air of Delhi city contains about 300 - 500 <*>
mu</*>g / m<sp>3</sp> of air of particulate matter and one inhales more
than 3 - 5 mg of particulates per day. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#34:1>
Before discussing the impacts of dust pollution on human beings,
it is essential to know briefly about various types of dusts, reaction of
body and lungs to inhaled dusts.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#35:1>
First we will discuss the types of dust from health point of view.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#36:1>
Dust ( aerosols composed of solid inanimate particles ) can be
classified in the following ways. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#37:1>
<h> <bold> Inorganic dust and organic dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#38:1>
Inorganic dust is responsible for pneumoconiosis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#39:1>
Various examples of inorganic dust are <mention> silica dust
</mention> , <mention> coal dust </mention> , <mention> asbestos dust
</mention> , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#40:1>
Organic dust usually results in bronchial asthma or hypersensitivity
pneumonitis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#41:1>
Examples of organic dust are <mention> thermophilic actinomycetes
</mention> , <mention> micropolyspora faeni </mention> , <mention>
micromonospora vulgaris </mention> , <mention> aspergillus clavatus
</mention> , <mention> aspergillus fumigatus </mention> , etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#42:1>
<h> <bold> Active and inert dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#43:1>
Few dusts are inert and does not do structurally any harm to the
lungs ( however, can cause some functional impairment if inhaled in
sufficient quantity for a longer period ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#44:1>
Examples are <mention> tin </mention> , <mention> iron </mention> ,
<mention> barium </mention> , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#45:1>
Contrary to the inert dust, few dust are active and potential to
cause pulmonary fibrosis ( fibrogenic dust ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#46:1>
These dusts ( for example coal dust, silica dust, etc. ) , do
structurally harm to the lungs. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#47:1>
<h> <bold> Industrial and environmental dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#48:1>
Examples of industrial dust are <mention> coal dust </mention> ,
<mention> silica </mention> , <mention> beryllium </mention> , <mention>
abestos </mention> , etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#49:1>
Examples of environmental dust are dust caused by storms, forest
fires, etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#50:1>
<h> <bold> Outdoor and indoor dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#51:1>
Dust in the outdoor environment is called outdoor dust while in
indoor environment ( for example room air ) is called indoor dust.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#52:1>
Other examples of indoor air dust are smoke dust as a part of
cooking or smoking, dust due to air conditioner units ( defective units /
improper maintenance ) , shoe dust, dust due to moisture on walls, etc. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#53:1>
<h> <bold> Respirable and inspirable dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#54:1>
Dust containing particles less than 7 micron size is called
<mention> respirably </mention> ( enters into lungs ) while dust containing
particles more than 7 micron size is called <mention> inspirable dust
</mention> ( can not enter into lungs ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#55:1>
<h> <bold> ACTION OF BODY AND LUNGS TO INHALED DUST </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#56:1>
Nature has provided a very efficient filter mechanism of dust
particles in our body.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#57:1>
All particles greater than 7 micron <}> <-> zise </-> <+> size </+>
</}> ( inspirable dust ) are likely to be trapped either in the nose or high
in the throat.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#58:1>
For example a dust particle of the size of a common pollen grain (
15 to 25 <*> mu</*> ) is likely to be caught in the nasal passages or at the
back of the throat.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#59:1>
The particles smaller than 7 micron size ( respirable dust ) will
enter into trachea ( wind <}> <-> ppipe </-> <+> pipe </+> </}> ) and lungs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#60:1>
The bigger particle of respirable dust are able to reach the
proximal airways while the smaller particles are able to reach the more
distal airways and alveoli.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#61:1>
Particles reaching the proximal airways ( bronchi ) may by
eliminated by ciliary blanket while particles reaching alveoli are eliminated
by other mechanisms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#62:1>
Within the alveoli there are other cells called phagocytes
which are brought out is vast horders by the stimulus of foreign bodies, such
as dust particles, which they engulf.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#63:1>
These dust laden cells, which have the power of independent motion,
may pass through the walls of the lung tissues into the lymph.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#64:1>
Most of the dust laden cells, however, migrate into the lymphatic
system.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#65:1>
Various bifurcations of trachea and bronchi, the considerable
amounts of dust is deposited by the phagocytic cells at tracheobronchial
lymph nodes and from here the healthy lung tissue starts damaging.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#66:1>
In general, once the dust is inhaled, the reaction of lung depends on
7 factors each of which is important in itself but all of which must be
considered in combination, since they are to a certain extent interdependent.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#67:1>
These factors are: </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#68:1>
<h> <bold> Chemical nature of dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#69:1>
Some dusts are harmful to the lungs while the others are
chemically inert. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#70:1>
<h> <bold> Size of dust particles </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#71:1>
Three main physical processes determine particle deposition in
lungs - - <mention> inertial impaction </mention> , <mention> sedimentation
</mention> and <mention> diffusion </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#72:1>
Nearly all particles more than 3 micron but less than 7 mscrons
are deposited in walls of tranchea and bronchi by inertial impaction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#73:1>
The majority of particles less than 3 microns in diameter are
deposited in respiratory bronchioles or alveoli, chiefly by mechanism of
diffusion but partly by sedimenation. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#74:1>
<h> <bold> Distribution of inhaled dust </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#75:1>
As also mentioned above some particles have the <O> <&> page </&>
487 </O> tendency to be deposited in upper part of the lungs, while some in
lower parts of lungs.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#76:1>
Obviously these particles will exert their harmful effects at the
site of distribution. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#77:1>
<h> <bold> Concentration of dust particles </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#78:1>
Ability of healthy lung to cope with introduction of dust
particles is related roughly to the concentration of airborne dust
inhaled.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#79:1>
Less than 10 particles of 5 micron / ml can be completely eliminated,
whereas only about 90 % of a concentration of approximately 1000 such
particles / ml will be eliminated and the retained 10 % can produce a slowly
developing pneumoconiosis.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#80:1>
With concentrations as high as 1,000,000 particles / ml, a very higy
proportion is retained and lung disease can develop rapidly. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#81:1>
<h> <bold> Duration of exposure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#82:1>
The great majority of cases of pneumoconiosis develop only
after many years of dust exposure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#83:1>
However, individual susceptibility also plays a role and
pneumoconiosis is also possible after brief exposure provided the individual
is highly susceptible. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#84:1>
<h> <bold> Individual susceptibility </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#85:1>
Different individuals with identical dust exposure may have
different reactions : one may be free of disease while another may show
advanced progressive stage. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#86:1>
<h> <bold> Clearance of dust particles </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#87:1>
This is accomplished by one or both of 2 mechanism - 
transport up by the mucociliary escalator and lymphalic drainage. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#88:1>
<h> <bold> IMPACTS OF DUST POLLUTION ON HUMAN BEINGS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#89:1>
Now it is the appropriate time to discuss impacts of dust
pollution on human beings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#90:1>
Basically there are 4 major areas of pollution, namely <mention> air
</mention> , <mention> water </mention> , <mention> noise </mention> and
<mention> soil </mention> which are mainly concerned with human beings.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#91:1>
Among these here the impacts due to particulate pollutants of air
will be discussed.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#92:1>
Suspensions of finely divided particles in air in the form of
fogs and mists are common natural phenomena.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#93:1>
Such type of suspensions are generally caused by storms, forest
fires, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#94:1>
On the other hand, within certain industries contamination of the
atmosphere with dust has long presented a problem.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#95:1>
Dust constitutes a nuisance and creates poor working conditions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#96:1>
The control of these industrial and other dusts continues as a
never ending battle.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#97:1>
The severity of air pollution caused by particulate matter can be
understood further by knowing the diseases for which dust pollution is
responsible.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#98:1>
Exposure to dust can produce several distinct types of diseases in
the body : </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#99:1>
1. Pneumoconioses are caused by various dusts, for example coal
<w> worker's </w> pneumoconiosis, silicosis, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#100:1>
2. Lung cancer may be caused by various occupational dusts,
like <mention> asbestos </mention> , <mention> nickel </mention> , <mention>
chromium salts </mention> , <mention> arsenic </mention> , <mention>
chloroether </mention> , <mention> mustard gas </mention> , etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#101:1>
3. <mention> Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis </mention> - - a
disease of lung characterised by restriction in lung inflation leading to
progressive dyspnoea and death, may be caused by : ( a) Occupational and
environmental dust, like <mention> silica </mention> , <mention> asbestos
</mention> , <mention> talc </mention> , <mention> kaolin </mention> ,
<mention> coal </mention> , <mention> cobalt </mention> , <mention> graphite
</mention> , etc., ( b) Organic dust, like <mention> actinomycetes </mention>
, <mention> penicillium spp </mention> ., <mention> aspergillus spp
</mention> ., etc., ( c) Toxic fumes and vapours, for example <mention>
chlorine </mention> , <mention> nitrogen oxide </mention> , <mention>
sulphuric acid </mention> , <mention> heavy metals </mention> , etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#102:1>
4. <mention> Chronic bronchitis and emphysema </mention> a
disease of marked morbidity and mortality is more prevalent in heavily
polluted areas than in less polluted areas. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#103:1>
5. <mention> Pulmonary oedema </mention> - - a condition of lung
characterised by exudlation of fluid in the alveoli and marked dyspnoea
may be caused when air polluted with toxic inhalants is inhaled suddenly.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#104:1>
6. <mention> Bronchiectasis-even bronchiectasis </mention> may
be caused by inhalation of polluted air.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#105:1>
Association of aspergillar species and proximal bronchiectasis is
well known. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#106:1>
7. <mention> Bronchial asthma </mention> - - a disease of lungs
characterised by episodic attacks of breathlessness, may be caused by
house dust and fungal spores apart from pollens.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#107:1>
Exacerbations of bronchial asthma are more common in areas where air
is polluted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#108:1>
One variety of bronchial asthma is occupational asthma in which the
symptoms appear at work place and the patient is free from symptoms at
weekend aad holidays. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#109:1>
8. <mention> Hypersensitivity pneumonitis </mention> - - a
disease of lungs affecting alveoli and mainefesting as breathlessness may be
caused by a variety of organic dusts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#110:1>
<mention> Mycoses-pulmonary mycoses </mention> may be caused by
inhalation of polluted air with fungal spores.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#111:1>
When fungal spores are inhaled they can lead to asthma, alergic
alveolitis or colonisation in lung and tissue damage leading to frank
pulmonary mycoses.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#112:1>
Examples <O> <&> page </&> 488 </O> of mycoses is allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis due to inhalation of aspergillus spores.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#113:1>
10. <mention> Rhinitis </mention> , <mention> sinusitis
</mention> , <mention> ottitis </mention> , <mention> conjunctivitis-allergy
</mention> to pollens, fungi and air pollutants may lead to development of
rhinitis ( a nasal problem characterised by itching, sneezing, running and
blocking of nose ) , sinusitis ( causes pain in face and headache ) ,
ottitis ( inflamation of ear ) , conjuntivities ( it causes itching, watering
and discharge from eyes ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#114:1>
11. <mention> Contact dermatitis </mention> mostly caused by
physical contact but aerosols suspended in environment may be the cause ( air
borne contact dermatitis ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#115:1>
12. <mention> Atopic eczema </mention> and <mention> contact
urticarias </mention> are allergic disorders of skin, sometimes aggravated
by biologically derived aerosols. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#116:1>
13. <mention> Metal fume fever </mention> is caused by inhaling
certain metalic oxide fumes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#117:1>
14. Systemic toxic effects are produced as the result of
either breathing or swallowing of certain dusts, for example lead and
manganese. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#118:1>
15. <mention> Mycotoxicosis </mention> is a rare toxic response
to products from certain moulds, producing fatigue, irritability and
inflamation of the heart. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-039#119:1>
16. <mention> The sick building syndrome </mention> consists of
a number of symptoms, namely : ( a) eye, nose and throat irritation, ( b)
sensation of dry mucous membranes, skin erythama, ( c) mental fatigue,
headache, nausea, dizziness, ( d) high frequency of airway infection and
cough, and ( e) hoarseness, wheezing, unspecified hypersensitivity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-039#120:1>
Causes of syndrame are many, namely ( <roman = lower.case> 1
</roman = lower.case> ) sealed buidings, <roman = lower.case> 2
</roman = lower.case> non-openable windows, <roman = lower.case> 3
