<h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#9:1>
The river Tungabhadra originates in the Western <indig> Ghats
</indig> on the border of Karnataka State and after traversing a course of
about 640 km joins the river Krishna at Sangameswar near Alampur in Andhra
Pradesh.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#10:1>
Right from its starting point till it merges in the Krishna river,
several devotees take dip on different religious occasions along its
entire stretch.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#11:1>
Large percentage of the river water is intended for irrigation of
<indig> lakhs </indig> of <indig> acres </indig> of land in Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh States.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#12:1>
Upto Sunkesula village the water is unpolluted, however, its
originality changes in the lower stretches due to tributories and storm
water drains.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#13:1>
Between Hospet ( Thungabhadra dam ) and Kurnool there is no major
town / city on its stretch.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#14:1>
At Kurnool, municipal sewage ( domestic ) and industrial effluents
are discharged into the river thus bringing about considerable change in
river water quality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#15:1>
Such a change is of significance not only for the residents of
Kurnool town but also for the downstream rural population on either side of
the banks of river who abstract the river water for domestic and agricultural
purposes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#16:1>
Water quality index ( <mention> WQI </mention> ) were calculated
from the water quality parameters to assess the status of river water quality
of the river for drinking purposes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#17:1>
The present study was conducted over a period of 4 months ( December,
` 92 to March, ` 93 ) to examine the variations in physico-chemical
characteristics of water during the mean flow periods of the river.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#18:1>
The suitability of the river water for public ( human ) consumption
was assessed by determining <mention> WQI </mention> at various sampling
locations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#19:1>
The detailed work methodology is given in the proceeding
paragraphs. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#20:1>
<h> <bold> MATERIAL AND METHOD </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#21:1>
Extremely high peaks are registered in the month of November due
to high floods.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#22:1>
The flow rate is well below the average over long periods of time (
during study period ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#23:1>
In order to obtain a fairly comprehensive picture of the intensity
of pollution, 8 sampling stations covering a total stretch of about 8 km (
from Railway bridge to Gondepalli village ) were selected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#24:1>
<mention> Sampling station - 1 </mention> is located near
Guntkal-Secunderabad railway bridge.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#25:1>
<mention> Sampling station - 2 </mention> is 1 km away from
<mention> sampling station - 1 </mention> on down stream side, whereas
<mention> sampling station - 3 </mention> is located at Gopal Darwaja about 2
km from sampling <mention> station - 1 </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#26:1>
<mention> Sampling station - 4 </mention> is about 4 km down stream
from the <mention> <+> Sampling </+> station - 1 </mention> and has a storm
water drainage ( about 0 030 cusecs ) in its vicinity.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#27:1>
<mention> Sampling station - 5 </mention> is located just down stream
side of water intake tower near paper mill.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#28:1>
<mention> Sampling station - 6 </mention> is located near <indig>
Dhobi ghat </indig> where large number of washers used the river for
washing the clothes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#29:1>
At <mention> sampling station - 8 </mention> the water is abstracted
for public consumption ( for Gondipalle village ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#30:1>
The location of various sampling stations selected for this are given
in figure 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#31:1>
To assess the extent of pollution during lean flows, winter months
were selected.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#32:1>
Grab samples were collected from all the 8 locations initially once
in a week for a period of one month and then once in a fortnight for a period
of about 3 month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#33:1>
Samples were collected from a depth of 0.15 to 0.45 m below the water
surface.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#34:1>
Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were determined directly at
the station itself.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#35:1>
The samples were transported to the laboratory immediately and <O>

and biochemical oxygen demand ( B OD<sb>5</sb> ) as per the standard
procedures ( APHA, 19 89 ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#36:1>
<h> <bold> RESULT AND DISCUSSION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#37:1>
Over all, 44 samples were analysed for selected water quality
parameters during the study period of 4 month.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#38:1>
The values of water quality parameters at all the 8 sampling stations
are given in table 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#39:1>
The pH value at all sampling sites ranged between 7.0 to 7.5 and are
close to the standard limits ( 6.8 to 7.3 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#40:1>
The temperature of water samples ranged between 25 to 29 <*>
degrees</*>C which also within permissible limits.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#41:1>
The temperature may not be more important for public supply, but
in the polluted water it has profound effect on the dissolved oxygen,
<mention> BOD </mention> and aquatic life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#42:1>
The chloride concentration was found to vary from a minimum of 80
mg / l to a maximum of 369 mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#43:1>
The presence of high levels of chlorides at site 4 is presumably an
indication of pollution especially through domestic sewage.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#44:1>
The values of chlorides at all sampling location except at site 4 are
within acceptable limits of 250 mg / l where as at site 4 it was 369 mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#45:1>
Total alkalinity values were in between 100 to 200 mg/l at
sampling sites 4, 5 and 6 and between 130 to 275 <O> <&> page </&> 605
</O> <O> Table 2. </O> <O> caption </O> mg / l at site 1.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#46:1>
Sulphate concentration of the river water samples ranged from 25 to
35 mg / l at all sites, which is well within the permissible limits.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#47:1>
Total hardness ( EDTA ) of the water sample at sampling site 4
was found to be 760 mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#48:1>
Hardness ( EDTA ) values of all other samples were between 100 to 200
mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#49:1>
These observations clearly indicate that the river water at
sampling site 4 is polluted especially from extraneous sources and which
may also be corroborated by the fact that around 0.03 m<sp>2</sp>/s of drain
water flows into the river near the sampling station - 4. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#50:1>
The dissolved oxygen content of the river water at all sites
ranged between 7 and 8.1 mg / l which is more than the required value ( 5.0
mg / l ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#51:1>
Large number of fish population were also observed at all the
sampling sites except at site 4.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#52:1>
Five day BOD at 20 <*> degrees</*>C of river water varied from 5 mg /
l to 32 mg / l.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#53:1>
<mention> COD </mention> of the river water samples varied from 20 to
280 mg / l, Moderate BOD and COd moderate to high values indicate possible
pollution especially nonbiodegradable organics, perhaps from the treated
discharge of the paper mill.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#54:1>
However, the test for MPN has not yielded any positive result perhaps
due to presence of some inhibitors. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#55:1>
<h> <bold> WATER QUALITY INDEX </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#56:1>
Water quality and its suitability for public consumption can
also be assessed by determining the <mention> WQI </mention> of river water
under consideration.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#57:1>
The <mention> WQI </mention> may be defined as a rating reflecting
the composite influence on the overall quality of a number of quality,
characteristics or water quality parameters ( Tiwari and Ali, 1988 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#58:1>
In the present study, out of 6 different methods suggested by Bottom
<it> et al </it> . ( 1978 ) , weighted arithmetic index is adopted for
calculation of WQI.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#59:1>
According to Ott ( 1978 ) calculation of <mention> WQI </mention>
consists of 2 fundamental steps, namely : ( a ) calculation of quality rating
for each water quality parameter used in the index, and ( b ) Aggregating of
these sub indicies into overall index.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#60:1>
The quality rating ( or sub indices ) q<sb>1</sb> corresponding to
the <mention> i<sp>th</sp> parameter P<sb>1</sb> </mention> is a number of
reflecting the relative value of this parameter in the polluted water with
respect to its standard or permissible value.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#61:1>
Quality rating may be obtained from q<sb>1</sb> - - 100 [ (
V<sb>1</sb> <*> approximate-sign</*> V<sb>10</sb> ) / ( S<sb>1</sb> -
V<sb>10</sb> ) ] Where V<sb>1</sb> - - Measured value of <mention>
i<sp>th</sp> parameter </mention> in the polluted water under consideration
V<sb>10</sb> - - The ideal value of this parameter in pure water,
S<sb>1</sb> - -

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#62:1>
Standard value for the <mention> i<sp>th</sp> parameter </mention> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#63:1>
In the above equation the sign ( <*> approximate-sign</*> )
indicates the numerical value of the difference, ignoring its algebraic
sign.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#64:1>
The overall arithmetic <mention> WQI </mention> is calculated by
aggregating the quality rating q<sb>1</sb> linearly. </p> <&> equation </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#65:1>
In the present study, 6 water quality parameters, namely pH, DO,
BOD<sb>5</sb>, chlorides, total hardness ( E DTA) and total alkalinity were
considered for computing WQI and unit weight ( W<sb>1</sb> ) of each
parameter is obtained depending upon its weightage ( Table 2 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#66:1>
The standard permissible values of various parameters <O> <&> page
</&> 606 </O> for drinking purposes is considered as recommended by Indian
Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#67:1>
The WQI of river water thus calculated is also given in table 2.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#68:1>
In addition, WQI of all 8 sampling stations were calculated to
assess the variation in river water quality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#69:1>
WQI of all 8 individual stations are given in table 3.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#70:1>
The permissible limit of <mention> WQI </mention> for drinking water
is 100 ( Tiwari and Mishra, 1985 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#71:1>
Tiwari and Ali ( 1988 ) made a preliminary survey of water quality
index of 18 Indian rivers and found the <mention> WQI </mention> value
ranging from 97 to 2051.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#72:1>
The WQI obtained in present study for Tunghabadra river is 230.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#73:1>
Kudesia ( 1980 ) reported a <mention> WQI </mention> of 174 for
Tungabhadra river near Bellary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#74:1>
A WQI of 230 implies that there is a further deterioration in
water quality of river Tungabhadra compared to that at Bellary which is on
the upstream side ( approx 150 km ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#75:1>
<mention> WQI </mention> at individual stations ranged from 202 to
240, suggesting the possible pollution of the river water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#76:1>
High <mention> WQI </mention> suggest that the water requires to be
treated before supplying for public consumption. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#77:1>
</h> <bold> CONCLUSION </bold> <h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-040#78:1>
Based on the water quality data obtained from this investigation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#79:1>
It becomes clear that the water requires treatment before
supplying for public consumptiion.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#80:1>
Computed WQI also implies possible pollution of river water.

<ICE-IND:W2A-040#81:1>
However, a comprehensive programme of monitoring the water quality
for longer period may further improve the understanding of the river system
and also the quality of river. </p>
