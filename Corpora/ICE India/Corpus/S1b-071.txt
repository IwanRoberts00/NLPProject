<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#1:1:A>
I extend a very <,> happy welcome <,,> to Dr Rajni Badlani <,,>
the English Studies Officer the British Council Division <,,> Bombay <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#2:1:A>
I am also very <,,> happy to <,> welcome <-> to </-> Dr Shastri <,,>
whom we have been missing for quite sometime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#3:1:A>
Uh <,> may I <,,> request honourable Chairman <,,> to offer <,> a
bouquet <,> to Dr <,> Badlani <,,> as a sign of welcome <,,> and request
honourable Chairman to offer a bouquet to Dr Shastri <,> who has come after
such a long time <O> claps </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#4:1:A>
And now that Dr Shastri is back <,,> and Dr Badlani is here <,,> I
hope <,,> that they continue to be with us <,> for quite sometime <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#5:1:A>
When we want the British Council help <,,> and we want Dr <w>
Shastri's </w> guidance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#6:1:A>
So with these words <,,> I conclude my <,> welcome speech <,,> and
well I here request honourable chairman <,> to say a few words <,,> <X> A few
words </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#7:1:B>
It gives me a great pleasure <,,> uh to welcome <,,> Dr Badlani
<,,> and our <,> beloved <,,> Dr Shastri once again <,,> to join us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#8:1:B>
We were really missing him for the last <,,> so many <,> months <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#9:1:B>
Now with the <w> God's </w> grace he is back <,,> and hope <,,> he
will be with us <,,> for many years to come <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#10:1:B>
With his <,,> guidance <,,> and assistance of <,,> British Council
<,,> the board of studies <,,> I think has come up with the <,,> nice <,,>
text book <,,> of standard nine <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#11:1:B>
And <,> they are also <,,> planning to have <,,> that the same book
<,,> of the same type <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#12:1:B>
As I understand this is a <,,> this book has a new approach <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#13:1:B>
It is <-> a </-> quite a good blend of <,,> structural approach
<,,> and uh <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#14:1:A>
Communicative

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#15:1:B>
Communicative skills <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#16:1:B>
In fact I don't know what is exactly <,> structural approach and
communications <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#17:1:B>
But <,> as <,> you are mentioning it again and again <,> I am
getting to it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#18:1:B>
Any <,> good change is always welcome <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#19:1:B>
But <,> as you know Dr Badlani <,,> no change is accepted properly
<,,> or whole heartedly <,> unless it is properly <,,> delivered <,,> or <,,>
people are made to understand it <,> in the right direction

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#20:1:C>
Yes <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#21:1:B>
So <,> it should be our endeavour <,,> it should be our <O>
one word </O> <,> it includes <,> Board of Studies <,,> State Board <,,>
teachers <,,> and students <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#22:1:B>
We must prepare them <,,> to accept this change <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#23:1:B>
And unless we prepare them to accept this change <,,> unless we
convince them <,,> what is good in this <,,> <w> we'll </w> have <,,> <}> <->
very difficult </-> <+> great difficulty </+> </}> to <,,> drive home <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#24:1:B>
It is not <,> only true for this English <,,> this will be true for
whole syllabus <,,> since our approach to <,> the new syllabus is also
changed <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#25:1:B>
We have included <,> many <,> new topics <,,> in the syllabus <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#26:1:B>
The Board is thinking <,,> to have <,,> orientation of all teachers
<,,> in all subjects <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#27:1:B>
It may be not <,> may not be a exhaustive one <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#28:1:B>
But at least two-three days <,,> orientation to all teachers <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#29:1:B>
And particularly for this English language <,> we require more
orientation <,,> because it being a foreign language <,> <w> it's </w> not
our mother tongue <,,> it is altogether different <,> and <,> difficult one
<,> to understand and learn <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#30:1:B>
And as <,,> we all know <,,> the condition <,> of English <,> in
rural areas in particular <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#31:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> have to have more efforts <,,> on this one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#32:1:B>
<w> It's </w> of <,,> high syllabus exercise <,> <w> it's </w> a
communication skill <,,> and here only we lack <,> in communication <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#33:1:B>
Teachers themselves lack in communication <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#34:1:B>
They can only read <,,> and ask students to <,> hear <,> listen <,>
and repeat the same thing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#35:1:B>
But <,> they hardly speak <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#36:1:B>
So <,> we will have to inculcate them <,,> inculcate into them <,,>
skill of <,,> speaking <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#37:1:B>
If they speak <,,> then only the students can <,,> be able to <,,>
speak something <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#38:1:B>
So <,> in order to prepare them <,,> this Board of studies <,> has
envisaged <,,> a programme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#39:1:B>
And for that programme atleast <,,> we will again <,,> request <,,>
British Council <,,> and particularly Mrs Badlani <,,> who has extended <,>
help <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#40:1:B>
We intend to <,,> in the initial stages we <}> <-> are </-> <+>
have </+> </}> <,> thought of preparing <,,> cassettes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#41:1:B>
Am I correct <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#42:1:A>
Video cassettes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#43:1:B>
Video cassettes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#44:1:B>
But somehow <,,> Dr Shastri <,> was not feeling well <,,> that
scheme has also <,> not come up <,> very well <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#45:1:B>
Nevertheless we have not dropped that <,> we have modified the
scheme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#46:1:B>
We will modify it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#47:1:B>
Instead of having a video cassettes <,> <w> we'll </w> have audio
cassettes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#48:1:B>
<w> We'll </w> have audio cassettes <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#49:1:B>
And <,> uh I think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has
been already completed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#50:1:B>
Even if fifty percent has to be completed <,> we will complete it
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#51:1:B>
And <,,> after the completion of recording <,,> we will have <,,>
efforts <,> we will make efforts <,,> to supply at least two cassettes <,>
per school <,,> so that <,> each school will have a cassette <,,> to listen
<,,> listen in a proper intonation <,,> listen correct English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#52:1:B>
And if they listen correct English <,,> they may speak correct <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#53:1:B>
For that also we may <,,> request <,,> British Council <,,> State
Board and other voluntary organisations to help us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#54:1:B>
Secondly <,,> <w> we're </w> also planning to have <,,> master
trainers course <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#55:1:B>
Nearly there are <,> sixteen thousand secondary schools <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#56:1:B>
If we take <,,> one teacher per school <,> <w> we'll </w> have to
train <,> minimum <,> fifteen thousand secondary school teachers <,,> in
English <,> for English <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#57:1:B>
To train <,,> fifteen thousand secondary school <,,> whether <,>
<O> two words </O> itself <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#58:1:B>
For that also <,,> <w> we'll </w> have to have first <,,> resource
persons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#59:1:B>
To train the resource person <,> we have to have <,> some master
trainers <,,> to train the master trainers <,,> <w> we'll </w> have to have
the help of <,> Board of studies <,> then <,,> teachers what you call them
<,,> uh experts <,,> then book writers <,,> and British Council <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#60:1:B>
For you also Madam <,,> we <,> request your organisation to have
<,,> uh your help <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#61:1:B>
We will also request <,> Central Institute of <,> English <,> to
extend their help <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#62:1:B>
Because if we can <,> if we can train <,,> good master trainers
<,,> then we can have the good <,> resource persons <,> and then only <,,>
there can be <.> percu </.> good percolation to the <,,> teachers there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#63:1:B>
If master trainers are not good <,> the resource persons will not
be good <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#64:1:B>
And if resource persons are not good <,> very few will be <,> very
less will be percolated to the teachers themselves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#65:1:B>
Uh in that way <,,> <w> let's </w> have <,> straight way from the
<,,> original resource only that is English British Council <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#66:1:B>
We will have master trainers from there only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#67:1:B>
So that is also one request <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#68:1:B>
And these master trainers or these workshops <,,> here <w> we'll
</w> prepare <,,> or we intend to prepare <,,> teachers handbook or teachers
guide <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#69:1:B>
Atleast then <w> we'll </w> have something <,,> to fall back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#70:1:B>
In the school they will have nothing <,> to fall back <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#71:1:B>
In <,,> big villages <,> or big cities <,> teachers have got <,,>
what you call that <,,> seminars <,> workshops <,> but in isolated <,,>
villages they hardly get any <,,> <-> or </-> guidance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#72:1:B>
So <,> our <w> teachers' </w> handbook <,> of particular subject
<,,> will be very handy for them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#73:1:B>
So one good <,> <w> teachers' </w> handbook <,,> will definitely
help them <,,> for that also <,> we will have the assistance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#74:1:B>
I will request for them as for Dr Shastri <w> I'll </w> get an
assistance <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#75:1:B>
I think <,,> it is worth <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#76:1:B>
I <,,> request <,,> representative of British Council <,,> to
extend their <,,> fullest possible cooperation <,,> to our endeavour <,> and
make this project a successful <,,> one <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#77:1:B>
If <,> uh with <}> <-> <.> dis </.> </-> <=> discussion </=> </}>
<,> any finer points will come up <,,> uh <w> I'll </w> not spell out each
and everything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#78:1:B>
Uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise <,> <O>
laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#79:1:B>
What will be the <,,> use of this meeting <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#80:1:B>
Thank you very much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#81:1:B>
Now <,> Dr Shastri is here <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#82:1:B>
We have regained our <,,> all <,> hope <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#83:1:B>
He is our <{1> <[1> hope </[1> he is our moral support <,> <{2>
<[2> and </[2> he is our guide <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#84:1:C>
<[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#85:1:C>
<[2> Right </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#86:1:B>
We were really missing him for last <,,> nearly six seven
months <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#87:1:B>
Now he is here <,> but even then we don't worry <,,> trouble him
much <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#88:1:C>
Sure <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#89:1:B>
He must <,> relax <,,> rest <,,> and work only when he enjoys
it <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#90:1:B>
You must work as long as you enjoy it <{> <[> otherwise </[> you
should not <,> you should take rest <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#91:1:A>
<[> Yes yes </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#92:1:B>
With these words I conclude my opening <,,> talk and <w> we'll
</w> have <O> one word </O> occasion <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#93:1:B>
Thank you very much <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#94:1:C>
Uhm <{> <[> I </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#95:1:A>
<[> May I </[> </{> request Mrs Badlani <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#96:1:C>
At first I like to thank you all very much for giving me such
a warm welcome <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#97:1:C>
And uh <,,> I must say that uh <,,> professionally I have been
English Studies Officer of the British Council <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#98:1:C>
I have been extremely pleased with the work that the Maharashtra
Board <,> has been doing <,,> and uh <,,> with whatever little support we
have been able to extend through <,> what ever limited funds we have <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#99:1:C>
When I compare it to this <,,> uh extremely <,> new project in the
Central Board of Secondary Education <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#100:1:C>
I find that uh <,> we have definitely not got even one <,> tenth
of the facilities <,> and one which they have got <,> because they have been
funded by another agency the O B A <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#101:1:C>
Ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the
Council in Bombay I have kept Maharashtra Board my top most priority <,> in
my budgeting <O> claps </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#102:1:B>
Thank you

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#103:1:C>
And uh <,> I will continue to do so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#104:1:C>
I am going to now put in a request <,> for <,> you know the other
uh <,,> help that you have asked for <,> which might mean uh <,> may be more
than one specialist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#105:1:C>
So far we have only been managing to get one specialist <,,> and
uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on <,> three or four
different books <,> a centre <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#106:1:C>
And now with the teaching training uh <,,> module <,> I think we
will definitely need more than one person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#107:1:C>
So uh <,,> <w> I'll </w> like to uh <,> reiterate the fact that I
am going to <,> continue my support as much as I can for the Board

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#108:1:C>
And <w> it's </w> very heartening to see that <,> you know <,> the
books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press
in May <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#109:1:C>
Ah in this context could I make a request of support <,> uh since
our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored <,> it would be
very helpful for me if I have I am given <,,> even if it is the rough draft
of the book <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#110:1:C>
So that I can say okay this we have produced <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#111:1:C>
This is the output of our input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#112:1:C>
And now <,> for the further output we need this much input

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#113:1:C>
It will strengthen my <,,> uh case where my asking for fund is
concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#114:1:C>
Because here I can show concrete evidence <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#115:1:C>
It is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know <w>
it's </w> in the press etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#116:1:C>
So uh <,> and why I am asking it now and not when the final
printout is out because <,,> uh <w> I'll </w> be asking for funds <,> in
April or May <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#117:1:C>
So <w> it's </w> at the time of asking the funds <,> that I would
like to show <,> some concrete evidence <,,> of whatever input we have made
so far <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#118:1:C>
Uhm <,,> I think I will not say much about uh <,,> what I want to
at this stage because we <,> <w> it'll </w> a lot of points will come up in
the discussion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#119:1:C>
Uhm <,,> but from <,> our experience with the C B S E project <,,>
uh we have learnt <,> a couple of lessons <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#120:1:C>
And that is <,,> it is important that <,,> whenever such uh <,,>
project is on <,,> to have a committee of people <,,> with of course one
convener or whatever <,,> to monitor the <,> progress of the <,,> project
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#121:1:C>
So that if for any reason <,,> some <,> one member is not able to
<,> come the other members can continue the course <,> and in this way I hope
<,> that what happened in <,> you know when Professor Shastri who as you were
very rightly said has been the guiding light <,,> and in fact he is the one
who approached us <,,> the British Council <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#122:1:C>
And <,,> I think the Board is very fortunate in having a person of
Professor <w> Shastri's </w> experience <,> knowledge <,> and qualification
to be the convener <,> because he is so well versed in E L T <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#123:1:C>
He has had lots of experience <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#124:1:C>
So he was able to pitch everything at the right level <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#125:1:C>
Uh ask <,> me for what kind of <,> suitable help I could extend
<,,> uh he I know put in a lot of effort <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#126:1:C>
I think too much efforts <,,> which uh <,> took its toll and <,>
and I I also would <,> now think that it is unfair that <,,> all the stress
should be only on one individual <,> <{> <[> so that we </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#127:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> what Kadepurkar said </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#128:1:C>
Sir again it will be one individual <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#129:1:C>
I would suggest that if we have atleast a member of <,> a
committee of three or four members <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#130:1:C>
Because even Harsh might at some points say okay now I have my <w>
son's </w> exams or my <,> something I cannot come <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#131:1:C>
So I think it is better to have a committee <,> and not then again
pressurise Harsh <,> uh as much <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#132:1:C>
So it will and <,> all sudden done <,> three or four heads
together <,> is better than one <,> and also the stress <,> which is on one
person will not be there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#133:1:C>
So I would strongly recommend <,> that for the project <,> you
form a committee <,,> and let that committee <,> uh work together

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#134:1:C>
So that <,> if one or two people cannot come <,> atleast the
remaining two continue the thing <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#135:1:C>
Because this was a big gap

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#136:1:C>
You know I was waiting in the Council office <,> for some
information <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#137:1:C>
And of course I knew about Professor <w> Shastri's </w> illness
<,> I <,> we did correspond over New Year when he was <,> he was much better
than stuff like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#138:1:C>
But then we lost out on <,> quite a lot of our <,> you know <,>
activities here <,,> which is in much one can always catch up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#139:1:C>
There is no <,,> I mean nothing has really gone <,,> uh uh array
but <,,> I think I would recommend that <,> you <,> formulate a committee <,>
rather than just keep it on one or two people <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#140:1:A>
For the teacher training project <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#141:1:C>
For the whole project not only the teacher training project
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#142:1:C>
For the whole project of division of classes <,> nine <,> ten <,>
eleven <,> twelve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#143:1:C>
We have now come to <,> uh <w> we've </w> finished nine and eleven
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#144:1:C>
We are now at the stage of uh <{> <[> looking </[> for identifying
texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#145:1:A>
<[> Looking </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#146:1:C>
So uh <,> you of course spoke only about the <w> teachers'
</w> awareness programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#147:1:C>
Am I to assume that you are also expecting uh <,,> rightly I hope
uh <,> some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth
and the eleventh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#148:1:B>
Yes we should include

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#149:1:C>
<w> That's </w> it

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#150:1:A>
I have included

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#151:1:C>
So that is what so it is not only teacher awareness
programmes

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#152:1:C>
I would <,> prefer to look at it as the whole project <,,> uh
which is the textbook revision <,,> and because the syllabus was already made
we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much
communicative skills as possible within <,> the constraints of the syllabus
<,,> and teacher training and somewhere I also read that <,,> you are looking
forward to <,> some kind of evaluation <,> of question paper as well

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#153:1:A>
Yes

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#154:1:C>
It should be part of the whole thing so in a way <,> it is
<,> it covers everything <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#155:1:C>
So I I would <,> not just say for the teacher training programme
but for the whole project <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#156:1:C>
And we depend of course on <w> everybody's </w> views

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#157:1:C>
That is just my suggestion <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#158:1:C>
And for our looking at past experience <,> I would say that uh
<,,> it will <,,> be beneficial to the project <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#159:1:D>
Do you think the committee to plan <,> or to execute <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#160:1:C>
Uh <,,> plan mainly plan <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#161:1:C>
Mainly plan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#162:1:C>
The committee cannot execute <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#163:1:C>
Committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing <,> they will
plan for the execution naturally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#164:1:C>
The three or four people will then

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#165:1:A>
The work of the committee will be only the policy nature <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-071#166:1:C>
Not necessarily <,> only <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#167:1:C>
It is not necessary only depending on <,,> uh the persons own uh
<,,> inclination <,,> his own <,> expertise <,> his own willingness <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#168:1:C>
Like Harsh <w> I'm </w> sure he as a member of the committee would
still like to be actively involved <,> in uh the teacher training programme
<,,> in the execution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#169:1:C>
So it is not either or <,> you don't have water tight compartment
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#170:1:C>
It depends like professor Shastri might just be there to give us
overall advice <,,> because he has so much experience <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#171:1:C>
He can tell us what he thinks about it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#172:1:C>
So he even he is very actively involved

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#173:1:C>
He might just oversee everything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#174:1:C>
So that again is very open ended <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#175:1:C>
<w> It's </w> not either or <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-071#176:1:C>
But for example if <,,> uh uh uh a specialist has to come <,> and
say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast
two other people will be available <,,> </I>
