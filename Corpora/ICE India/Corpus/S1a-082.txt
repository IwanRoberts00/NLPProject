<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#1:1:A>
Anjani I have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics
<,> can you <,> tell me <{> <[> something </[> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#2:1:B>
<[> Sir </[> </{> <w> that's </w> the very interesting question

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#3:1:B>
I <,,> started my career as a teacher of English <,,> and in post
graduated classes <,,> I was <,,> uh I started teaching <,,> Henry James <,>
and Browning <,> <{> <[> Ahn <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#4:1:B>
Henry James because I was working on him then

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#5:1:B>
And Browning because no one in that year was teaching Browning <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#6:1:A>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#7:1:A>
Which year was that <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#8:1:B>
That was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#9:1:A>
Sixty-eight <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#10:1:B>
And then in under this graduate classes <,,> uh <,,> something
very interesting happened

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#11:1:B>
The university introduced <,> courses on language <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#12:1:A>
Ahn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#13:1:B>
And there was a professor <,> I won't name <,> who was trained
in C I E F L <,> in the earliest C I E and then in <,,> uh Pune <,> <{> <[>
ah ahn <,> in linguistics <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#14:1:A>
<[> Ah ahn </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#15:1:A>
Ah ahn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#16:1:B>
But when he was asked to teach that course <,> he refused <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#17:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#18:1:B>
He said <quote> <w> I'm </w> a teacher of literature I won't
do the job of this course </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#19:1:B>
And now the head of the department of English in Science college
<,,> was a student of London University <,> and had undergone <,> rigorous
training in linguistics during his days <,> but in his whole life he never
got <,,> chances to teach linguistics other than <,> that he was teaching
only English and the English courses in classes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#20:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#21:1:B>
I was the youngest person <,,> <{> <[> he said </[> <quote>
okay <,> <{> <[> Uhm uh <,> now there is an opportunity for you <,,> this is
the syllabus <,,> and either you teach in the class <,> or I teach it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#22:1:A>
<[> <O> Laughs </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#23:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#24:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#25:1:B>
And if you agree to teach I will teach you <,> <{> <[> Uhm <,>
how to teach grammar

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#26:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#27:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#28:1:B>
So I availed <}> <-> those </-> <=> that </=> </}> opportunity
like this yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#29:1:A>
Was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a <{> <[>
traditional grammar </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#30:1:B>
<[> No no it </[> </{> was grammar in under graduate classes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#31:1:A>
I see <,> <{> <[> it was </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#32:1:B>
<[> It was </[> actually

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#33:1:A>
Traditional grammar in <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#34:1:B>
You know Hornby books and some other books

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#35:1:A>
I know

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#36:1:B>
But Hornby was the main <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> and some books
which C I E F L has just published in linguistics <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#37:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#38:1:B>
So I said <quote> okay <w> I'll </w> do it </quote> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#39:1:A>
Ahn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#40:1:B>
And when <,> in off hours <,> he gave me <,> very good
background for nessasary <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#41:1:A>
Ah ha <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#42:1:B>
And of <,> Jesperson <,> particularly Jesperson and in the
library at all college professors and all there so I got interested <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#43:1:A>
Ahn ha

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#44:1:B>
Then <,> when Professor Verma came to <,> Science college <,>
<-> he </-> I was his student his brother was my classmate so he <,>
persuaded me to join the Central <?> Institute of English </?> Hyderabad <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#45:1:B>
And there <,,> somehow I came in very close contact with Professor
Gokak

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#46:1:A>
<indig> Accha </indig>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#47:1:B>
<O> One word </O> he was the Director of that <O> one word
</O> Institute in sixty-five

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#48:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#49:1:B>
And that also was interesting in a different way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#50:1:B>
In Patna university we had a book <,> paper on <?> practical views
</?> <,,> where we were not getting the name of the author <,> or the period
when <}> <-> there is </-> <=> something was written </=> </}> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#51:1:B>
And we would argue <}> <-> with </-> <+> in </+> </}> the classroom
<,> as to which period it could belong <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#52:1:B>
Who possibly could be the author <,> just observe it for the style
of writing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#53:1:B>
And Professor Gokak started during that class of <,> kind of thing
in this class there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#54:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#55:1:B>
In Hyderabad <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#56:1:B>
So I could do very well

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#57:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#58:1:B>
<w> That's </w> what brought me close to it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#59:1:B>
But I was never very close to <?> Oldfeild </?> who was teaching
grammar

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#60:1:B>
Somehow I didn't like him

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#61:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#62:1:B>
I didn't like his assistant <,,> uh <,> who was an <?>
American </?> <,> but I got along well with Yadurajan and Nambiar

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#63:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#64:1:B>
And my <,> pronounciation was very much <,> influenced by the
<indig> Bihari </indig> atmosphere although <,> in high school I was the
product of an English medium school <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#65:1:B>
Our teachers were mostly <,,> but Nambiar <,> you know <,> helped
me in speaking nice English <,> and all his lessons particularly with
reference to long stresses <,> we used to talk a lot <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#66:1:B>
Anyway then I went to <,> <?> south </?> there was one

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#67:1:B>
The other was <,> Masica

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#68:1:A>
Uhn <{> <[> for the </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#69:1:B>
<[> We </[> </{> became very friendly <,> for non- academic
reasons

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#70:1:B>
We just became very friendly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#71:1:B>
And then I wrote a paper that paper you know <{> <[> uh <,> which
was written <,> in the train <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#72:1:A>
<[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#73:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#74:1:B>
You know I was <,,> uh called very urgently I had to go from
<,,> Hyderabad to <,,> Calcutta then to Patna and back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#75:1:B>
And the day I was back <,> was the day when we were supposed to <,>
submit the term paper <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#76:1:B>
So I had no time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#77:1:B>
Touch <?> and go </?> I think

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#78:1:A>
In the train

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#79:1:B>
<O> One word </O> and in the train <,> and uh <,> he was his
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#80:1:B>
And then I got scholarship to go to Chicago <,> I would say <,>
Masica was <,,> some what influential he introduced my name there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#81:1:B>
Uh I was <O> one word </O> to go there and then <O> one word </O>
these people something happened <,> and uh <,> that was political <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#82:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#83:1:B>
So I was <,> my name was chucked out <,> and then I went for
<,> under this Chicago scholarship <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#84:1:B>
And there I <,> uh in the beginning I was very <O> one word </O>
without <O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#85:1:B>
I did not like <,> phonetics

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#86:1:A>
Uhn <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#87:1:B>
You know Bansal was not there when I was there <,> I I didn't
like it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#88:1:B>
And uh <,,> once or twice <,,> guide told me if you want to sit <?>
in </?> to literature <,,> he had no objection <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#89:1:B>
I said <quote> no <w> I'll </w> study phonetics </quote>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#90:1:B>
So <w> that's </w> how I came in <,> but the main point I would say
<,> was <,,> that it had been a very <,,> boring experience <,> to remain a
teacher of English

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#91:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#92:1:B>
And <w> I've </w> no <O> one word </O> of boring in the sense
that <,> you are <,> <-> in </-> destined to teach the same author because
nobody else is ready to change his subject

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#93:1:A>
You are right <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#94:1:B>
So you go on teaching the same

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#95:1:A>
Year after year

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#96:1:B>
Go on repeating the same thing year after the year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#97:1:B>
Whereas in this discipline <,> whatever I learnt in Chicago this is
the best job

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#98:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#99:1:B>
But what I teach in the classroom <,> like what <w> I'm </w>
<,> I was going to teach is very difficult

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#100:1:A>
Is very difficult <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#101:1:B>
What what I acquired there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#102:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#103:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> a process of <O> one word </O> and patience
which goes on time

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#104:1:B>
What about you <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#105:1:A>
No when we went to Chicago I <O> one word </O> interesting
<,> when we went to Chicago those were really the hot years <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#106:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#107:1:A>
I think we were

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#108:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#109:1:A>
And that <,> debate between uh generative semanticists and
<,> <{> <[> <w> that's </w> it <,> what Chomsky was trying to say <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#110:1:B>
<[> <w> That's </w> it </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#111:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#112:1:A>
Although <,> it all started with Chomsky himself

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#113:1:A>
I mean it all came out of <{> <[> respect in a sense </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#114:1:B>
<[> Other <w> that's </w> right </[> </{> <w> that's </w>
right

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#115:1:A>
And <,> they were also M I C at that time <O> a few words
</O> college uh <O> a few words </O> uh George Lakoff

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#116:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#117:1:A>
And uh <,,> it now seems that the issues were not really
substantial <,> <{> <[> I mean the </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#118:1:B>
<[> The issues </[> </{> were very substantial

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#119:1:A>
I see <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#120:1:B>
The issues were very substantial in the sense that generative
semanticists <,,> were the ones who took these <,> basic <?> thought </?>
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory <,> very seriously <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#121:1:A>
Uh ha <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#122:1:B>
And in that process they ran into trouble <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#123:1:B>
You <,> you know one of the basic assumption was <,> that all the
meaning is there in the basic deep tructure

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#124:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#125:1:B>
You know <,> you <,> you remember the earlier argument as to
why <O> one or two words </O> is better than the deep structure in that <?>
manner </?> is that <w> it's </w> not part of what you hear <,> but one can
analyse what is here is the basic thing <w> that's </w> the deep structure

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#126:1:B>
So if all the meaning is there in the deep structure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#127:1:B>
Then <,,> you have to <,> think about <,,> uh <,> ways <,,> in
which <,> sentences <,> develop from deep structure <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#128:1:A>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#129:1:B>
Which made the process very complex <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#130:1:B>
Generative semanticists didn't find it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#131:1:B>
They made it as complex as was necessary to <,> maintain this
assumption

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#132:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#133:1:B>
Chomsky on the other hand <,> did not <,> do that <,> when he
realized that it <}> <-> was </-> <+> has </+> </}> become very complex <,,>
he withdrew himself <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#134:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#135:1:B>
And he said well <O> one word </O> structures <O> one word
</O> <,> <w> let's </w> play a role as semanticists <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#136:1:A>
And he

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#137:1:B>
And that was it he <,,> uh conflict <,> in the hope <,> so
actually it was a better theory <,> people had then trivial views of <O> one
word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#138:1:A>
You know <,> for including <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#139:1:B>
But still he he maintains the point <,> to the extent that
<O> one word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#140:1:B>
But as I was a part of this thing I can see that the issues were
really very very serious issues according to us <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#141:1:A>
But uh <,,> certain things <,> disappeared with the <O> one
word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#142:1:B>
It it disappeared uh <,> with what has suffered <O> two words
</O> not exactly the semanticists to <,> uh uh founder of Chomsky

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#143:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#144:1:B>
Uh you see if you make something very powerful

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#145:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#146:1:B>
And he becomes so powerful that you can't control it <,>
there is no

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#147:1:A>
It is not possible I know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#148:1:B>
No that is it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#149:1:B>
Then it is no longer your methodology <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#150:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#151:1:B>
Do you remember the <,> story of this fossil

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#152:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#153:1:B>
So the methodology with the generative semanticists developed
<,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#154:1:A>
Uhn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#155:1:B>
Which is so complex and so powerful <,> that it could explain
anything <,> but in a very very complex manner <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#156:1:B>
And <,> there may be point <O> two words </O> George Lakeoff
withdrew things like <O> one word </O> that I wish <O> one word </O> had
constructed

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#157:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#158:1:B>
And things like global <{> <[> concect </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#159:1:A>
<[> Global </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#160:1:B>
Anything could be explained in terms of global concect <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#161:1:B>
And he also introduced what he called <,> you know what is
technically is called <?> one word </?>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#162:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#163:1:B>
You know like it is uh say <,> uh <.> po </.> point <,> uh
three two seven <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#164:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#165:1:B>
Percent <,> uh now

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#166:1:A>
Yes <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#167:1:B>
That type of calculation

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#168:1:A>
Pure mathematical conclusion <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#169:1:B>
And that turned majority of practitioners

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#170:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#171:1:B>
<O> Two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#172:1:B>
It is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you
mention the other day

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#173:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#174:1:B>
That plays a very trivial role because there were other
people who had <O> Chicago </O> <,> like <,> uh have always have big problems
that is including <O> one word </O> themselves

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#175:1:A>
No the point is how can <O> two words </O> trying to make is
that <,> that cohesive group was not there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#176:1:A>
And there was no <}> <-> attempted </-> <+> attempt </+> </}>
forming of

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#177:1:B>
No no there was

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#178:1:A>
Society like group <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#179:1:B>
No no there was a cohesive group

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#180:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#181:1:B>
I think that <,> uh also a kind of <O> a few words </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#182:1:A>
No no <,> it seems to me <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#183:1:B>
There was a cohesive group <,> though not located in Chicago
throughout the year <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#184:1:A>
The other <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#185:1:B>
<}> <-> Chicago was </-> <=> Chicago was </=> </}> the centre
<,> all the participants used to spend <-> there </-> lot of their income on
<O> two words </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#186:1:A>
I see <,> okay

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#187:1:B>
And free <,> you know free publication articles were <,,> uh
available as soon as they were titled

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#188:1:A>
Yeah <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#189:1:B>
And in some cases you know like sometimes <O> one word </O>
like <,> writes the script time thing <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#190:1:A>
Uhn

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#191:1:B>
And he just get it xeroxed <O> two words </O> it could be <O>
one word </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#192:1:B>
And then there would be you know further xeroxing also <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#193:1:B>
So it was not that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#194:1:B>
And Chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#195:1:A>
Yes that you mentioned <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#196:1:B>
Yes that was the centre of

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#197:1:A>
For a while

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#198:1:B>
For those it was known <,> not there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#199:1:A>
Not there at all

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#200:1:B>
He doesn't know how <,> uh how much <{> <[> <O> one word </O>
</[> was there

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#201:1:A>
<[> <O> One word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#202:1:B>
Ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#203:1:B>
You can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea <,>
and he doesn't <,> wait for the next day to go and meet Macaulay <,> <{1>
<[1> uhm <,> and he writes up a note for pages and <,> you know <,> just push
it inside the door <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#204:1:B>
And Macaulay comes <{> <[> and </[> looks at the notes and decides
this is something which <,> is really exciting and must be done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#205:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> Macaulay who might justification for that
analysis

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#206:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> talking about electrical precomposition

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#207:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#208:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#209:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#210:1:A>
Ah ha

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#211:1:B>
Which was <,> actually if I use the term invention

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#212:1:A>
Uhm <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#213:1:B>
It was invented by <,> his students not he

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#214:1:A>
Uh ah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#215:1:B>
But he gave the justification <,> so there was no <,> in in
terms of Macaulays <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#216:1:A>
Yeah you were asking about me <,> <{> <[> you know </[> how
did I

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#217:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#218:1:B>
Yeah <O> one word </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#219:1:A>
How did I get into <,> because I was also like you teaching
literature <,> at the university <,,> and uh <,,> joined linguistics <,> not
very seriously to begin with <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#220:1:A>
But one thing was there that I <,> I did wonder about the way
literature was used in language <,> this is one thing <,> <w> that's </w> <O>
one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#221:1:A>
And then I was very deeply influenced by Professor Pundit <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#222:1:A>
He used to be the head <,,> uh English department <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#223:1:A>
And we had a very distinguished uh <O> two words </O> was there
then <O> one word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#224:1:A>
But Professor Pundit in particular <,> and I got attracted to
socio- linguistic <,> and I did a piece of work <,> uh with with professor
Pundit on the teachers of Hindi <,> trying to show how Hindi was <,>
diverging into different directions <,> one would get Sanskritized <O> one
word </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#225:1:A>
And then I did quite well in my M Ed <,> and Mr Pundit thought
that I should be in <O> two words </O> in England <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#226:1:A>
And there I was quite deeply influenced by Professor <O> one word
</O> as a socio-linguistic including also the work of <O> a few words </O>
<.> parti </.> particularly the work of <O> one word </O> because he was my
<O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#227:1:B>
<indig> Accha </indig> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#228:1:A>
And I worked on the Punjabi <,> immigrants there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#229:1:A>
I think that was the first uh <,,> research thesis on <,>
immigrants assimilation of the local language <,,> maintenance of their own
language and culture <,,> one of I think quiet often quoted <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#230:1:A>
Then I came back and uh <,,> fortunately got a job here <,>
teaching linguistics since <,,> but <,> yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#231:1:B>
We can talk <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#232:1:A>
Uhn <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#233:1:B>
Uh well <w> that's </w> very fine I have no news since
nineteen eight years <{> <[> <O> one word </O> </[> sometimes eighty or some
nine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#234:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#235:1:A>
Eighty-seven perhaps

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#236:1:B>
Uhn <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#237:1:A>
Little before that time <,> seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#238:1:B>
No seventy-nine <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> because I came back in
seventy-nine

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#239:1:A>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#240:1:A>
Yeah okay,

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#241:1:A>
We met in Hyderabad

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#242:1:B>
Ah yeah <w> that's </w> true <,> and since then <,> all we
have been introduced to each other <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#243:1:A>
Why is it that uh <,,> you and I <,> not have <,> problems
<,> differental issues <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#244:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#245:1:A>
Whereas I find that most <,> socio-linguists <,> <{> <[> uhm
<,> do not get along well with their colleagues <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#246:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#247:1:B>
You see

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#248:1:A>
I I am not talking just for personally

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#249:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#250:1:A>
Purely of academic level <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#251:1:A>
What is your view <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#252:1:B>
You see I think uh the problem is that uh <,,> most
socio-linguists I know <,> particular in the Indian context <,> have opted
for socio-linguistic as a soft option <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#253:1:B>
Whereas they they don't want to understand <,> I don't think you
can do good socio-linguistics <,> without uh <,> sort of fully understanding
the structure of language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#254:1:B>
I think you have to be <,> I think socio-linguist <,> is <,> is a
way of being a link <,> and really <w> it's </w> just a bit <O> one word </O>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#255:1:B>
So you have different perspective <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#256:1:A>
You may have a generative perspective but you may socio-
linguistic perspective

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#257:1:B>
But both are trying to be linguist <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#258:1:B>
So I have <,> I have always benifitted from what Chomsky had to
say or what the <O> one word </O> say or what other <,> theoritical linguist
have to <,> have to say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#259:1:B>
I have never had any cult <,> <{> <[> of socio </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#260:1:A>
<[> <w> That's </w> <O> one word </O> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#261:1:B>
There is a point <,> that if you are doing socio- linguistic
or <O> one word </O> linguistic <,> you are concentrating <,> from the
linguistic point of view <,> either on phonology or morphology or syntax or
may be two of them or three of them

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#262:1:A>
Yeah <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#263:1:B>
And each one <,,> has to had statistical approach <,> other
than the question of <,> socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and
then what kind of conclusions you want to draw <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#264:1:B>
Ah <,> keeping that in mind <,> do you think that <,,> there
should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and <,,> you know
socio-linguist

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#265:1:A>
No I don't think <,> I think they <,> that the goals are <,>
common except I will add one <O> one word </O> <,> now this is my recent in
the last three or four years <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#266:1:A>
Uh <,> so far <w> I'm </w> concerned it should apply equally well
with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#267:1:A>
But I think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical
linguist can always find other justifications <,> which socio-linguist I
think will not be <}> <-> justify </-> <+> justifying </+> </}> with that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-082#268:1:B>
I think socio-linguist <,> has a social responsibility <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#269:1:B>
He cannot escape the question of language at all <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-082#270:1:B>
A pure theoritical linguist <,> who is dealing with it pure as
pure form <,> and a pure mathematical form <,> will say <w> I'm </w>
interested in abstract logic and mathematical development <,> although <,> he
may not <,> you see <,> but </I>
