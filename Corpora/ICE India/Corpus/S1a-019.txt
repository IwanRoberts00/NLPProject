<ICE-IND:S1A-019#76:1:A>
Actually <w> it's </w> a part of office only

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#77:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#78:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#79:1:A>
Uh no <,> she is <,> breakfast I make it <,,> uh initially we
used to have a girl with us

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#80:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#81:1:A>
Who would make the <,> breakfast and then <,,> uh in between
uh <,,> my mother-in-law was there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#82:1:A>
So no problem

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#83:1:A>
Otherwise I make my breakfast <,> uh myself <,> also <,> for my son
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#84:1:A>
And then my wife leaves <,> uh my lunch ready <,,> because actually
then I have to look after both the kids no <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#85:1:A>

She leaves much early <,> seventy-thirty quarter to eight <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#88:1:A>
So <w> it's </w> as <,,> kind of difficult life anyway <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#89:1:B>
For us we have a very <,,> solid back up

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#90:1:B>

<w> I've </w> my own scooter <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#102:1:A>
Of course then <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#103:1:B>
It doesn't take much time you know <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#104:1:C>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#105:1:B>
Ten fifteen minutes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#106:1:B>
And we are not <,> uh we don't have to sign etcetra <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#107:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#108:1:B>
So <w> it's </w> not necessary that we should be there
exactly on the time <,,> no need

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#109:1:A>
In my case <w> I've </w> to go <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> because

Because I remember you told me <,,> in the British Council
<,> that uh <,> you may not be joining us <,> so

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#150:1:C>
But I didn't know it will go on upto <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#151:1:B>
But it went on <,> for quite <,> it was such a <,,> informal
nice free <,,> gathering and <,> uh there was little tension <,> because we
knew nothing was going to happen today <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#152:1:C>
Yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#153:1:C>
How many of you were there <,> at one <,> I mean at a time <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#154:1:B>
First eighteen <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#155:1:C>
<indig> Accha </indig> <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#156:1:B>
Second plus twelve <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#157:1:C>
So thirty all together

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#158:1:A>
Thirty plus <,> again another twenty-five

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#159:1:B>
Not forty

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#160:1:A>
Fifty-five

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#161:1:C>
Fifty-five <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#162:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#163:1:B>
That lady from Padma Sheshadri School Madras

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#164:1:A>
Rajalaxmi is it <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#165:1:B>
I met her <,> last year

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#166:1:C>
Yeah I know Rajeshwari

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#167:1:B>
I met her in Gandhinagar last year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#168:1:B>
<w> She's </w> good <,> <w> she's </w> really good <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#169:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#170:1:B>
But uh <,> some of the RPs that they have trained does not
<,,> uh <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> your calibre <,> they does not <,>
not all of them are <{> <[> one of them </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#171:1:A>
<[> Such conditions have happened </[> </{> <,,> by and large

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#172:1:C>
But most of them are good <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#173:1:A>
Any thing is there produced <,,> uh materials <,> which uh do
not require <,> much uh resource personnel <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#174:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#175:1:A>
No actually <,> they had also to cover the whole of the
country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#176:1:A>
So those differences are bound to be there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-019#177:1:A>
Now I wonder how many people from the north east also were trained

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-019#178:1:C>
