<I> <O> Q 3 ( a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#1:1>
Graham Greene is one of the leading figure in <+> the </+> field
of literature of England.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#2:1>
He is <w> England's </w> main Literary <del> exported </del> exporter.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#3:1>
His novels are read all over the world where English is spoken.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#4:1>
<quote> ` Heart of the Matter' </quote> is his best known novel which
is praised all over the world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#5:1>
Mr. Scobie is the hero of <w> Greene's </w> novel <quote> " Heart
of the Matter" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#6:1>
He is pathetic and tragic figure at the end of the novel.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#7:1>
At the beginning Scobie is police officer.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#8:1>
He is very just, loyal to his profession<+>.</+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#9:1>
Pity for all is the key-note to his character.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#10:1>
He is called <quote> " Scobie the just." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#11:1>
He is police ( English ) officer serving in <}> <-> Nothern </-> <+>
Northern </+> </}> part of Africa in British Colony.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#12:1>
He <}> <-> had </-> <+> was </+> </}> married to Louise and <del> f
</del> at the time of marriage he had promised Louise all happiness in his
life time.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#13:1>
Louise was not very beautiful but still their marital life was going
on <del> to </del> very well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#14:1>
Scobie did not receive any bribery in his life time but now his wife
Louise want to go to South Africa out of <}> <-> boardoom </-> <+> boredom
</+> </}> at <del> Nort </del> North Africa.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#15:1>
So Scobie had to take money from Yusuf on loan with low interest.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#16:1>
Yusuf being a smuggler <w> Scobie's </w> conscience was not clear to
loan some money from Yusuf but circumstances compelled him to borrow money
from him.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#17:1>
Yusuf took advantage of situation and sought help of Scobie in
illegal <}> <-> bussiness </-> <+> business </+> </}> of diamond transaction.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#18:1>
Once <}> <-> Scobies </-> <+> <w> Scobie's </w> </+> </}> life
was smoothly running.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#19:1>
Now there came in Mrs Helen Rolt.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#20:1>
She caught on the <}> <-> wreched torpoedoed </-> <+> wretched
torpedoed </+> </}> boat by which she and her husband were coming.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#21:1>
They were just married two <}> <-> day </-> <+> days </+> </}> early.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#22:1>
Now <del> th </del> Scobie went to take stock of situation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#23:1>
He saw young beautiful girl <del> of her nice </del>

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#24:1>
She was Ninteen years of age.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#25:1>
Very beautiful, young and innocent.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#26:1>
Now Scobie fell in love with her.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#27:1>
Helen too got attracted towards him as there was no other go.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#28:1>
Scobie was not libertine.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#29:1>
His attraction towards Helen is not out of sexual motives, but God
wanted that.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#30:1>
Now Scobie is fixed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#31:1>
He is in <}> <-> dilema </-> <+> dilemma </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#32:1>
On one side he had promised his wife Louise all happiness and <}> <->
and </-> <+> on </+> </}> other side his temptation of flesh. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#33:1>
Scobie is stern Catholic.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#34:1>
He used to go to church regularly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#35:1>
Told his sins and asked pardon.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#36:1>
<del> Fh </del> Father Rank was his best friend, but now he was not
willing to go to church.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#37:1>
Started telling lies.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#38:1>
He had firm belief in God.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#39:1>
He knew that the game which he <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}>
playing with his wife and beloved Helen <}> <-> is </-> <+> was </+> </}>
contrary to his spiritual knowledge.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#40:1>
Now neither can he leave Louise nor Helen.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#41:1>
<mention> The Heart of the matter </mention> is that he is caught in
<}> <-> dilemna </-> <+> dilemma </+> </}> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#42:1>
He never wanted to hurt any of them.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#43:1>
So he decided to commit suicide and that is the only alternative
to this problem.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#44:1>
So he commited suicide.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#45:1>
Thus Scobie is very pathetic figure at the end of <+> the </+> novel.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#46:1>
Spiritual, & catholic knowledge about evil, sin and subsequent
damnation unbalanced his equation of life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#47:1>
He never wanted to <del> fro </del> give pain to both the Ladies.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#48:1>
Thus only solution he could find is suicide.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#49:1>
His knowledge of good and evil brought the tragic end to his
glorious, <del> of </del> innocent life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#50:1>
Thus he misses both the world of spiritual and of temptations. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#51:1>
Greene has characterised his hero <del> h </del> very superbly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#52:1>
Whole action is centered around this, single character.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#53:1>
Thus Henry Scobie is best artistic creation of Graham Greene. </p>

<I> <O> Q.4 ( a) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#54:2>
<quote> " Mall Flanders" </quote> is very <}> <-> super </-> <+>
superb </+> </}> novel by Daniel Defoe.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#55:2>
It is <del> blend </del> blend of ( realistic ) social novel and
picturesque novel.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#56:2>
It is <w> Defoe's </w> great genius that he made this imaginary <del>
or </del> character realistic.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#57:2>
Mall is a central character in this novel.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#58:2>
She is shown to be whore and criminal but what went in making her
whore and thief is note worthy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#59:2>
As every writer <}> <-> can not </-> <+> cannot </+> </}> avoid the
time in which he had lived.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#60:2>
Thus social conditions too get reflected in his writing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#61:2>
Novel is <mention> interpretation of human life </mention> though <}>
<-> fictious </-> <+> fictitious </+> </}> still <del> has </del> it has to
be some typical reality in it. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#62:2>
Mall is born at Newgate prison.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#63:2>
Her mother was whore and criminal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#64:2>
In the childhood she lived with Gypsies then she was <}> <-> haded
</-> <+> handed </+> </}> over to nurse and then to one well-to-do family.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#65:2>
As <w> Moll's </w> birth has taken place at prison from the whore
what can be predicted of her life afterwards.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#66:2>
Yet she came to good family.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#67:2>
She got a little education at this house <}> <-> now </-> <+> and
</+> </}> she became young and attractive.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#68:2>
Thus Robin, a boy in a house praised her beauty and gave money and
seduced her.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#69:2>
This is the first step of her whoredom.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#70:2>
Then she married to younger brother of his, Robert.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#71:2>
Thus she now became wife of one brother and mistress of another.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#72:2>
Now she lost her husband and she got two sons by this husband.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#73:2>
Now she got <del> 2 1200 </del> <*> pound </*> 1200 was free <del> d
</del> to go any where <del> by </del> without children.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#74:2>
She felt that money was great security of life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#75:2>
Thus she wanted to be wife of some wealthy husband.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#76:2>
So she married one <}> <-> linean </-> <+> linen </+> </}> draper but
he too proved unmatched.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#77:2>
He himself was in debt so he left Moll and went away.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#78:2>
<mention> Moll </mention> too changed her name as <mention> Mall
</mention> Flanders here.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#79:2>
Now again she was alone without any security & money.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#80:2>
She now married to one Gentleman.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#81:2>
He took her to Virginia <}> <-> there </-> <+> where </+> </}> he had
good plantation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#82:2>
She got two children out of this husband.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#83:2>
Her <}> <-> mother in law as </-> <+> mother-in-law was </+> </}>
very kind but during their discussion Moll could understand that she is her
real mother and she had married <-> to </-> her own brother.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#84:2>
Thus again she left the house in Virginia came to London.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#85:2>
Now she came in contact of Governess who got Moll married to
Gentleman who <del> was </del> actually was Highway man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#86:2>
Thus she left this man though she <del> too </del> loved him <del> to
</del> much.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#87:2>
Now she came in contact of one Gentleman who got <del> board </del>
<}> <-> boared </-> <+> bored </+> </}> by family life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#88:2>
Thus to pass the time he came to Moll.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#89:2>
He <-> do </-> left Moll because of his unhealthy physical condition.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#90:2>
Now Moll has become quite old had <del> no that </del> no charm
that had in her young age<+>.</+> <}> <-> thus </-> <+> Thus </+> </}> she
started <}> <-> theft </-> <+> thieving </+> </}> and became expert in that
profession.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#91:2>
She robbed innocent children and picked bags from shops.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#92:2>
She did all these things out of <del> money </del> scarcity of money.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#93:2>
Finally she <+> was </+> caught by police while stealing and sent to
Newgate prison where she was born and on request by priest transported to
Virginia alongwith Highway man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#94:2>
She prospered there and came to London as <}> <-> well to do </-> <+>
well-to-do </+> </}> lady. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#95:2>
Thus social conditions have made Moll whore and thief.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#96:2>
Had the boy in house not seduced her first time her life would have
been different.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#97:2>
Had <}> <-> had </-> <+> her </+> </}> husband not died her life
could have <+> been </+> different.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#98:2>
Lack of money gave her instability in her life so she went on from
one person to other to get security and money, but most of the time she could
not do well because of society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#99:2>
She became thief, it is sheer out of poverty.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#100:2>
Thus her whole life was unstable because of social circumstances.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#101:2>
In those days women were looked down upon who had no fortune <+> and
</+> could not get good husband.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#102:2>
Women were considered inferior to men.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#103:2>
Education was provided only to upper-class ladies, that is why Moll
could not get proper education. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#104:2>
Thus her poverty, lack of education no parentage, social evil
available at the time of <w> Moll's </w> <del> fio </del> life <del> bro
</del> made Moll criminal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#105:2>
Her misfortune too played great role in making her criminal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#106:2>
Social atmosphere too plays greater role in making her whore, thief
and criminal. </p> </I>

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#107:3>
<quote> " Great Expectations" </quote> is <w> Dicken's </w> well
known novel and <w> it's </w> conversion in to play form is manifestation of
its achievement.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#108:3>
<del> In </del> This novel <del> it </del> is just like a well made
play.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#109:3>
It has been divided <}> <-> in to </-> <+> into </+> </}> three acts
and at the end of every act it is told that the end of respective <}> <->

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#110:3>
This play is very <del> oly </del> dramatic.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#111:3>
It continuously changes <del> co </del> and develops. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#112:3>
This is the story of young man Pip who is living along with his
sister Mrs <}> <-> Gorgery </-> <+> Gargery </+> </}> and brother-in-law Mr.
Joe <}> <-> Gorgary </-> <+> Gargery </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#113:3>
He is blacksmith by profession.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#114:3>
Pip had to help him in his business.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#115:3>
Joe was kind to Pip though Mrs Gargery was little tough.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#116:3>
Once Pip came across one <del> bandit </del> convict who escaped
from prison and police <del> where </del> were searching him.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#117:3>
His name is <del> Havi </del> Abel Magwitch, who later on turned to
be <w> Pip's </w> benefactor.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#118:3>
There lived one landlady Miss Havisham.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#119:3>
She was deceived on the day of her wedding and thus she is still in
same <}> <-> uttire </-> <+> attire </+> </}> since then and eager to take
vengeance on whole of manhood.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#120:3>
She has adopted one daughter Stella which later on confirmed <del>
that </del> was of Mr Abel <}> <-> Magaitch </-> <+> Magwitch </+> </}> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#121:3>
Now once Pip gets information <del> Act </del> that <del> exp
</del> great expectations are awaited for Pip.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#122:3>
Thus Pip goes to London for education and learning aristrocratic
manners.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#123:3>
He <del> b </del> by the <}> <-> times </-> <+> time </+> </}>
forgets Joe and dislikes his profession.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#124:3>
Pip thinks that his benefactor is Miss Havisham who wants to make
him suitable match for Stella.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#125:3>
But when Mr Magwitch visits Pip at London and <del> tells </del>
tells him that he is the <del> bef </del> benefactor, his dreams <+> are </+>
shattered.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#126:3>
He never wanted his benefactor to be a convict.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#127:3>
He started despising Joe but when he <}> <-> swing in to </-> <+> is
in </+> </}> debt and falls ill, Joe helps him look after him well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#128:3>
These <-> all </-> moves his heart.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#129:3>
Stella is married to Mr Prembroke but their marriage is not a
success.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#130:3>
He helps Mr Magwitch to go to Australia as police is behind him.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#131:3>
He also helps Miss Havisham when her clothes <}> <-> caught </-> <+>
catch </+> </}> on fire.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#132:3>
Thus change comes in Pip in his behaviour.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#133:3>
Now he come <-> to </-> <del> wh </del> home and when <+> he </+>
visits old mansion he finds Stella all alone.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#134:3>
He takes her hand <del> and </del> never to part. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#135:3>
This is the very touching & <}> <-> griping </-> <+> gripping
</+> </}> story and plot construction.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#136:3>
There are no digressions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#137:3>
Story going on very smoothly, which act <}> <-> any </-> <+> no </+>
</}> obstruction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#138:3>
Characterisation is superb.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#139:3>
<w> Pip's </w> evolution is gradual from boyish attitude to maturity
to humanitarian attitude.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#140:3>
Thus hero has developed properly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#141:3>
Character of Joe is another good creation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#142:3>
He has fatherly feelings towards Pip.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#143:3>
Mrs Gargery is not sketched properly as she has no role <+> to </+>
play.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#144:3>
Mr Jagger is <del> a </del> lawyer who is devoted to <+> his </+>
own profession and does not tell any secret.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#145:3>
He talks very less.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#146:3>
Stella is puppet in the <}> <-> hads </-> <+> hands </+> </}> of
Miss Havisham.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#147:3>
At last she marries Pip.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#148:3>
Mr <}> <-> Abell Magaitch </-> <+> Abel Magwitch </+> </}> <del> &
</del> has greater role to play.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#149:3>
Thus characterisation is very superb.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#150:3>
No character is unwanted.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#151:3>
All help to compose good story. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#152:3>
Play is divided in acts into three equal <}> <-> division </->
<+> divisions </+> </}> ( 1) <w> Pip's </w> boyhood, help to convict ( 2) his
life at London ( 3) his life after Return from London and marriage with
Stella. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#153:3>
The theme is that spiritual development of a man has more
expectation than earthly prosperous development.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#154:3>
Hero passes from boyish attitude to humanitorian love at the end of
play. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#155:3>
<}> <-> imagery </-> <+> Imagery </+> </}> and symbols are used
aptly.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#156:3>
<}> <-> Black smith </-> <+> Blacksmith </+> </}> symbolises
reality.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#157:3>
Hand cuffs shows reality and notorious life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#158:3>
Thus this novel is superb creation of Charles Dickens.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#159:3>
This novel has been transformed <}> <-> in to </-> <+> into </+>
</}> good play, and its theatrical success has great manifestation of success
of novel form also. </p> </I>


<I> <O> Q.2 ( b) </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#160:4>
20th century is the century of novel as all aspects of complex
life is reflected in it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#161:4>
Earlier conditions prevailed for novel writing were different than
those available in 20th century.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#162:4>
There is lot of influence from the <del> from </del> foreign agency
like Russian writers like Tolstoy, <}> <-> Grkey </-> <+> Gorky </+> </}> ,
<}> <-> Some </-> <+> some </+> </}> French novelist like Balzac, <}> <->
Maussipl </-> <+> Maughm </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#163:4>
There were influences from Belgium, Scandinavian.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#164:4>
Russian shown the sweep of the canvas of the novel form.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#165:4>
French taught the delicacy and depth in the novel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#166:4>
War conditions made good impact on the mind of reader and
writer. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#167:4>
In 20th century external description of the matter is not
important but internal working is important.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#168:4>
Now this age is of space age

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#169:4>
There are so many war and peace is disturbed.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#170:4>
There is no stability in the mind of youth and reader.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#171:4>
Thus his mind is occupied by so many problems, and <del> he has more
</del> human life has more of internal work or rather mental work <del> to
</del> as is physical work.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#172:4>
Thus psychological novel came into being. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#173:4>
James Joyce has started psychological novel and that has been
enriched in later years.

<ICE-IND:W1A-018#174:4>
Now there is lot <}> <-> off </-> <+> of </+> </}> development <->
has been done </-> in the field of psychology and the character could be
analysed by sitting in the Laboratory. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-018#175:4>
Lawrence <w> Sterne's </w> <quote> " Tristran Shandy" </quote>
