<ICE-IND:S2B-045#1:1:A>
Hello <w> I'm </w> Meenakshi V today <w> I'm </w> going to  
speak <,> on the topic <mention> Science and Happiness </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#2:1:A>
There have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists <,> to make  
our lives <,> more comfortable <,> more safe and more interesting <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#3:1:A>
But if we ask the question <,> <quote> Have these discoveries made  
men happier </quote> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#4:1:A>
It is difficult <,,> to give a true answer <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#5:1:A>
The chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because <,>  
<mention> happiness </mention> is not a material thing <,> which can be given  
to us <,> like food or <,> motor <,,> or a radio set <,,> it is in our mind  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#6:1:A>
Just think carefully <,> and you will see that this is so <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#7:1:A>
If you get something which pleases you <,> the happiness is not in  
the thing <,> but in your mind which finds the thing pleasurable <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#8:1:A>
There is another point about <mention> happiness </mention> <,>  
which is also worth thinking about <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#9:1:A>
Happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#10:1:A>
It does not come to you when you try to get it <,> and keep it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#11:1:A>
On the contrary it depends on the fewer <,,> fewness of your wants  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#12:1:A>
Just think about it <,,> this also carefully <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#13:1:A>
A man who has <,,> many wants <,,> always wants more <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#14:1:A>
He wants one thing and tries to get it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#15:1:A>
He gets it but he is not satisfied <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#16:1:A>
He wants something else <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#17:1:A>
The more he gets <,> the more he wants <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#18:1:A>
Is not that true <,> of most people who want wealth or power <,> or  
high position <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#19:1:A>
Most people are like that <,> even if their wants <,,> are for <,>  
smaller things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#20:1:A>
A boy wants a bicycle <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#21:1:A>
His father gives him one <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#22:1:A>
He sees someone with a <}> <-> <.> be </.> </-> <=> better </=>  
</}> bicycle so he wants one <,> like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#23:1:A>
When he is a little older he wants a motor cycle <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#24:1:A>
Then he wants a motor car <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#25:1:A>
If he has enough money to buy one he wants another <,> and a bigger  
one <,> and so on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#26:1:A>
But a man who has few wants <,,> whether he is poor or rich <,> has  
a much better chance of being happy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#27:1:A>
The wisest men in the world <,> have taught us that the only  
complete happiness <,> is when one wants nothing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#28:1:A>
It is difficult for us to be like that <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#29:1:A>
But nevertheless <,> it is true that merely having <,> more does  
not make us happier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#30:1:A>
That is why most people are not happier today <,> even with many  
wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#31:1:A>
Some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped  
<,> to make our lives happier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#32:1:A>
Science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#33:1:A>
That is a great thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#34:1:A>
It is difficult to be happy in your body <,,> if your body <,> is  
full of pain <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#35:1:A>
We have learnt of <,> the many discoveries made by scientists to  
make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#36:1:A>
By making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria  
<,,> small-pox <,> plague pneumonia and tuberculosis <,,> science has  
lenghtened the life of the average man <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#37:1:A>
In nineteen hundred every baby born in the U S A <,> could be  
expected to live less than fifty years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#38:1:A>
Fifty years later the health conditions <,> have so much improved  
that the average length of life <,> was nearly seventy years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#39:1:A>
A few hundred years ago the average length of life <,> was less  
than thirty years <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#40:1:A>
<}> <-> But it <,> certain <,,> but it is certain <,,> sorry </->  
<=> but is it certain </=> </}> that people were less happy in those times  
<,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#41:1:A>
What is the use <,,> what <,> what is the use of living longer  
unless you are also happy <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#42:1:A>
Science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#43:1:A>
By this it is helping to prevent famine <,,> and sickness due to  
undernourishment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#44:1:A>
It has also made it possible to send quick relief <,> to places  
where there is shortage of food and medicines <,> with the help of motor uh  
motor lorries <,> railway trains <,> ships and aeroplanes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#45:1:A>
This is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#46:1:A>
But in India and some other countries such as Indonesia <,> and  
South America <,> the number of people <,> is increasing faster than than the  
food supply <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#47:1:A>
Science has not yet <,> found out how to solve that problem <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#48:1:A>
It is <-> a </-> very serious because there will be worse and worse  
famine <,,> unless it is solved <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#49:1:A>
And people certainly cannot be happy <,> if they are starving <,>  
can they <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#50:1:A>
There are also many discoveries of science which have definitely  
brought <,> unhappiness into the world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#51:1:A>
That is not <,> because the discoveries are bad <,> but because men  
are using them badly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#52:1:A>
For example <,> consider the discovery of the gun powder <,> and of  
other explosives <,> each more powerful than the previous one discovered <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#53:1:A>
In ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they  
were near enough to strike each other with stones <,> arrows <,> spears or  
swords <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#54:1:A>
Even in the battles of the olden times <,> which history calls  
great battles <,> the armies on both the sides usually consisted <,,> only of  
a few thousand men <,> and the number of wounded and killed in the wars <,>  
of those times <,> was not very great <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#55:1:A>
In most wars <,> except a few such as the wars which destroyed the  
Roman Empire <,> the peasant went on cultivating their fields peacefully <,>  
even when the armies were fighting a few miles away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#56:1:A>
But the invention of fire arms and high explosives <,> caused a  
great change <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#57:1:A>
A modern machine gun <,> or quick firing gun <,,> worked by a  
single man <,> can wound and kill hundreds of people <,> in a few minutes  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#58:1:A>
One modern bomb can kill thousands <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#59:1:A>
It is said that the latest type of <,> atomic bomb could kill <,>  
hundreds of thousands of people immediately <,> if it was dropped on a big  
city <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#60:1:A>
The scientists <,,> who invented these terrible <,,> weapons are  
not wicked men <,> who enjoy killing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#61:1:A>
They are people with kind hearts <,> like yours and mine <,> but  
they are more clever <,> and they can earn their living by discovering new  
things <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#62:1:A>
It is the leaders of the various nations <,> who employ them to  
make discoveries <,> which can be used to kill the people <,,> of <}> <-> <.>  
o </.> </-> <=> other </=> </}> nations <,> that are to blame <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#63:1:A>
The same country <,> discoveries <,> could be used only for useful  
purposes if the leaders did not allow them <,> to be used for killing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#64:1:A>
Explosives are not harmful <,> if they are used for such purposes  
as helping to get coal <,> metals and other minerals out of the earth <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#65:1:A>
The same motors and aeroplanes <,> which are used to carry guns and  
drop bombs <,> can be very useful for good purposes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#66:1:A>
So you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are  
bad <,> but the ways in which men use them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#67:1:A>
Now let us try to find out why men use them <,> for harmful  
purposes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#68:1:A>
It is not easy to find this out <,> but it is very important <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#69:1:A>
Unless you can find it out <,> there will be more and more terrible  
wars in your <,,> your own time <,> and if we go on like that our  
grand-children <,> will not be able to live in this world at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#70:1:A>
The earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#71:1:A>
With these few words I end my speech <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#72:1:A>
Thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#73:1:A>
Thank you once again <,,> </I> 
 
 
<I> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2B-045#74:2:A>
Hello <,> <w> I'm </w> Shantala speaking in <,,> uh speaking  
<,> for the total literacy <,> <}> <-> </.> in if </.> </-> <=> inevitable  
</=> </}> for the political social and <,> economic development of a country  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#75:2:A>
On the world scene on one hand India can stand proudly shoulder to  
shoulder with frontline countries <,> in matters of space research <,>  
advanced technology etcetera <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#76:2:A>
But in literacy queue we are far behind other countries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#77:2:A>
<w> It's </w> well known world over that the areas of poverty and  
illiteracy <,> more or less overlap each other <,> in a map and continued  
illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of  
democratic institution in a country <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#78:2:A>
In this context functional literacy <,,> becomes all the more  
significant and important <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#79:2:A>
Mere <?> advertisement </?> and learning three hours <,> is of no  
consequence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#80:2:A>
Rather than an end in itself <,> literacy should be regarded as a  
way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#81:2:A>
Literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development <,>  
and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans  
<,> but also of plans and projects for development of <,> all sectors of  
national life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#82:2:A>
Considering the experience of many other countries <,> the targets  
fixed by <w> India's </w> educational planners are by no means beyond  
realisation <,> but still are lagging behind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#83:2:A>
<w> Let's </w> analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a  
few more specific situations <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#84:2:A>
There are very prejudices facts and <,> taboos <,,> which frown  
upon literacy <,> go indeed to demonstrate <,> its strength 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#85:2:A>
Let us start with the example of industrial workers <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#86:2:A>
An Industrial worker in <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> organised  
sector <,> however intelligent and enterprising <,> is also in need of access  
to information about the source of raw material <,> and its conversation to  
<,> finished goods price standardisation and quality control marketing <,>  
rate fixation process <,> provision relating to safety and the work <,,> at  
the work place etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#87:2:A>
A belief that <,,> thus an illiterate worker can also successfully  
operate machines <,> can <}> <-> <.> repar </.> </-> <=> repair </=> </}> and  
maintain them is nothing but <}> <-> a </-> <+> an </+> </}> affirmation <,>  
of a blind prejudice <,> could be the outcome of <,,> vested interests <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#88:2:A>
A worker in the <,,> unorganised or the semi- organised <,> sector  
is in need of <}> <-> <.> sem </.> </-> <=> similar </=> </}> access to  
information about various process <,,> of modernisation <,> improved farming  
<,> suitability of a particular soil <,> to a particular crop quality of  
seeds fertilisers and other modern methods <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#89:2:A>
The malfunctional middlemen <,> who rob the legitimate share of the  
farm and the forest produce <,> may be tactfully dropped <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#90:2:A>
The plight of the share croppers <,> of the landless agricultural  
labourers <}> <-> <.> fact </.> </-> <,> <=> factors </=> </}> which lead to  
their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#91:2:A>
Yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#92:2:A>
They should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look  
around them and the world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#93:2:A>
They must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#94:2:A>
Example of <}> <-> <.> back </.> </-> <=> blacksmith </=> </}> <,>  
should leave his old slumber <,> and <,,> switch on to new electric arc  
furnace etcetera 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#95:2:A>
The potter to electric wheels <,,> and others <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#96:2:A>
In the social background <,> improving the <}> <-> <.> sta </.>  
</-> <=> status </=> </}> of women <,> uh depends mostly on literating the  
woman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#97:2:A>
It helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#98:2:A>
Woman <,> it helps a woman in tracing her identity <,> and strength  
and weakness herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#99:2:A>
No more she is what we say in Sanskrit <indig> Koop Manduke  
</indig> <w> that's </w> the frog in the well <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#100:2:A>
And even in the political situation the voting right of a person  
is <,> denied <,> that is because a person is illiterate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#101:2:A>
And if a person is literate <}> <-> he <.> ca </.> <,> </-> <=> he  
cannot </=> </}> be deceived by the <}> <-> <.> politi </.> </-> <=>  
political </=> </}> parties or the politicians <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#102:2:A>
They can fight for the rights to a greater extent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#103:2:A>
Thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant  
and dramatic results <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#104:2:A>
It can <,> <w> it's </w> an absract weapon <,> through though  
powerful which gradually trains and equips some <,> human mind and prepares  
it <,> increasingly for <,> eventual change <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#105:2:A>
These few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total  
literacy <,> for a countries all round development <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-045#106:2:A>
Thank you <,,> </I>
