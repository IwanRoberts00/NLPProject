<quote> " MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY" </quote> -
- 12th MAY. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#4:1>
I am writing this letter to wish you, well in advance
because after  
this stopover, we are sailing non-stop for 26 days to reach
China sometime in  
the first week of May. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#5:1>
Then it will be too late to write to you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#6:1>
It is more than a month now since I joined this ship, &
still not a  
single letter has reached me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#7:1>
I expect some, in this port. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#8:1>
Let us see. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#9:1>
I rang up Kop as well as to Rajashree on 2 <sp> nd</sp>
April from  
Germany. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#10:1>
Luckily Appa was also at home. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#11:1>
I will call up from China or Japan next time sometime
in the middle  
of May </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#12:1>
I hope you are doing fine at ISMT. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#13:1>
Where are you posted now? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#14:1>
Pune or Jejuri? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#15:1>
I could not meet you or even contact you on phone
while joining  
because of the last minute formalities. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#16:1>
I was too busy. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#17:1>
I feel very bad<->,</-> <del> since </del> that I
could not meet you. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#18:1>
Anyway do write to me at the earliest & send me your
address too. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#19:1>
How often do you go to Kolhapur now? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#20:1>
How are Appa & Amma? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#21:1>
What are <w> Appa's </w> immediate plans? ( and
post-retirement  
plans?) 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#22:1>
What about his trip to Switzerland? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#23:1>
Do write in detail. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#24:1>
I am planning to come back home in the middle of
Oct., get  
married & go for my exams to UK in 1 <sp> st</sp> week of Jan
' 94. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#25:1>
Accumulate your leave & keep yourself free during
Nov-Dec. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#26:1>
And try to remain in <del> your </del> Pune. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#27:1>
<del> Dose </del> Doesn't matter even if it is desk
work there. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#28:1>
Staying in Pune, you can do a lot of useful things. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#29:1>
Plan in that direction to settle finally in Pune. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#30:1>
We will soon make a home there. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#31:1>
There is nothing much to write from here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#32:1>
It is all the usual routine that I am very used to,
now. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#33:1>
Except that each time I get to see new countries. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#34:1>
This time I had been to Bristol in England, Ghent in
Belgium &  
Bremerhaven in Germany. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#35:1>
In Germany, I bought a pair of shoes, an electric iron
( steam), an  
egg beater & some rolls for my camera. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#36:1>
If you want anything in particular, do write to me. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#37:1>
Tell Appa & Amma also. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#38:1>
This time I plan to bring home, either a video camera
or a 386 ( CPU  
only). 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#39:1>
Not yet decided. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#40:1>

Dear Appa, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#49:1>
I hope you have received my earlier letter sent
locally through a  
friend. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#50:1>
It is very difficult to send mail from here, even
receiving is a  
little difficult. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#51:1>
So we have to rely mostly on <del> / </del> telephone
for important  
matters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#52:1>
I hope you have got my contact number on ship. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#53:1>
At present I am doing fine here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#54:1>
Already <del> w </del> over a month now! 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#55:1>
We had been to Europe & now on our way <}> <-> Back
</-> <+> back  
</+> </}> to Japan. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#56:1>
The stopping over in between is due to sub-contracts
so that we don't  
have to sail entirely empty on our way back. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#57:1>
The main charter is for loading in Japan ( Honda Cars)
& discharging  
in various places in Europe. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#58:1>
The whole <del> w </del> voyage is approx 2 <del>
<unclear  </del>  
months. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#59:1>
So far I haven't received any letters. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#60:1>
I am expecting some, here. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#61:1>
If not, then I have to wait all the way upto Japan ie
in May! </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#62:1>
Some time in May, our Chief Engr & 2 <sp> nd</sp>
Engr are  
signing off. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#63:1>
So <del> I</del> new people will be joining at that
time. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#64:1>
You may write to me on Bombay address so as to reach
Bombay in the 1  
<sp> st</sp> week of May. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#65:1>
They will collect it & send it along with these
people. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#66:1>
It will reach me much faster. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#67:1>
If you happen to be in Bombay around that time, then
you can meet  
Eddie <del> te & </del> personally ( or Vargese ) & hand over
the letter. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#68:1>
Anyway, there is nothing very urgent to communicate at
present. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#69:1>

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#79:1>
Did you buy a washing machine for her? 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#80:1>
I have bought an Egg beater in Germany ( Philips) &

Dear Appa, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#92:1>
We reached here safely, although it took us
sometime to settle  
down. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#93:1>
And as soon as I came to South Shields I was involved
in the course  
thoroughly. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#94:1>
We went to Mansfield directly from Hethrow to <w>
Snehatai's </w>  
place ( <w> Atul's </w> cousin) 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#95:1>
She has a couple of friends in South Shields. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#96:1>
One of them - - Dr. Ravi Kulkarni has a house ( spare
& vacant) where  
we have put up. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#97:1>
<del> The </del> It is a little away from the college
but we are  
quite happy with the place. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#98:1>
I commute to & fro by metro rail. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#99:1>
This place has quite a large crowd of Indian
community; so we do not  
feel out of place. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#100:1>
Dr. Ravi & Mrs are very friendly & helping. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#101:1>
Even Dr Arvind & Mrs Sneha in Mansfield were very
caring. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#102:1>
So we were quite happy. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#103:1>
My college <del> is </del> timings are 9 to 5. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#104:1>
And the day being small it is dark when I go in the
morning & again  
dark already when I return. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#105:1>
This place is fully furnished with kitchen utensils
as well. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#106:1>
All we have to buy is Grocery, dairy & toiletry. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#107:1>
My course is expected to end by 3 <sp> rd</sp> week
of March after  
which I have to arrange for the written papers & Viva. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#108:1>
So I intend to finish off everything by early April. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#109:1>
We have not moved around anywhere because of the
cold. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#110:1>
But we plan to do some sightseeing <del> sn </del>
later in March. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#111:1>
More over, travelling is quite an expensive business.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-010#112:1>
Rajashree has settled quite comfortably to the
climate although  
she gets lonely sometimes during the day when I am away at the
college. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#113:1>
I am sure your health must be improving
day-by-day 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#114:1>
Take rest - - lots of it. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#115:1>
Gulli must be coming to Kolhapur frequently. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#116:1>
Hope Amma is not worrying about us. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-010#117:1>
Tell Gulli to write to me frequently & you can also
drop in a few
