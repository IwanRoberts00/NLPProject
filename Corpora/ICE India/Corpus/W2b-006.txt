<bold> T</bold><smallcaps>HE</smallcaps> beginnings of painting
are lost to us in the dark caves where the pierced bisons and magical hand
prints guard the secret of their genesis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#4:1>
Speculations about the birth of tragedy do not transport us directly
to the source of a shattering experience conveying the tragic sense of
life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#5:1>
Even the <quote> ` Ode to a Grecian Urn' </quote> does not have the
magic power to make the urn yield the enigma of its birth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#6:1>
The birth of all arts, except cinema, is shrouded in mystery and
is far removed from us in time and perhaps in spirit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#7:1>
The belief in the magical powers of <w> one's </w> art, in its
capacity to control the forces of the cosmos and the minds of men, does
not come easily to a modern artist who feels his importance against even the
market forces to which he must submit his art. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#8:1>
Cinema was born just a century ago and has mingled so intimately
with our lives as no other art form has done in our age.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#9:1>
As Arnold Hauser says, our age can be justly described as the Film
Age. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#10:1>
Yet, in one hundred years of its existence, it has equalled and
sometimes surpassed the highest achievements of the other arts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#11:1>
Having been madly in love with it for the best part of my life, I
would like to celebrate its 100th birthday by feasting on the glimpses of
the everchanging contours of its enigmatic, dear face.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#12:1>
For a brief instant, I would like to freeze on frames that catch
something of its aerial spirit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#13:1>
At the gate of this theatre, where we watch these short clips in
accelerated motion, we must have the face of Janus, looking at flashbacks and
flashforwards. </p>

It is a world without sound, without colour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#17:1>
Everything there <*> dotted line</*> is dipped in monotonous grey
<*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#18:1>

Suddenly something clicks, everything vanishes and a train
appears on the screen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#20:1>
It speeds straight at you - - watch out!

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#21:1>
It seems as though it will plunge into the darkness in which you sit,
turning you into a ripped sack full of lacerated flesh and splinetered bones,
and crushing into the dust and into broken fragments this hall and this
building, so full of women, wine, music and vice." </quote> </p>

Maxim <w> Gorky's </w> review of the Lumiere programme at the
Nizny-Novgorod fair was published on the fourth of July, 1896.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#23:1>
In him, we have one of the earliest witnesses to the capacity of
verisimilitude that cinema has. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#24:1>
Cinema changed the art of narration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#25:1>
Tolstoy had anticipated the tremendous and far reaching impact
that cinema was going to make on the art of writing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#26:1>
He said this on his 80th birthday.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#27:1>
August 1908; <quote> " You will see that this little clicking
contraption with the revolving handle will make a revolution in our life - -
in the life of writers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#28:1>
It is a direct attack on the old methods of literary art.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#29:1>
We shall have to adapt ourselves to the shadowy screen and to the
cold machine.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#30:1>
A new form of writing will be necessary <*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#31:1>
But I rather like it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#32:1>
This swift change of scene, this blending of emotion and
experience - - it is closer to life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#33:1>
In life, too, changes and transitions flash by before our eyes,
and emotions of the soul are like a hurricane.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#34:1>
The cinema has divined the mystery of motion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#35:1>
And that is greatness <*> dotted line</*>

In the reeds of film art sits the toadthe businessman.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#37:1>
Above him hovers the insect - - the artist.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#38:1>
A glance, and the jaws of businessman devour the artist.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#39:1>
But that does not mean destruction <*> dotted line</*> in the belly

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#40:1>
Great writers from all over the world have been fascinated by
cinema.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#41:1>
From Tolstoy to Kundera, we have a long line which includes
Sartre, Malraux, Beckett, Joyce and a galaxy of names.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#42:1>
Poetry has been affected by the concept of montage, which in turn has
learnt a lot from poetry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#43:1>
Classics of literature have not only found a new life in the
country of their origin, but have undergone a complete metamorphosis like in
<w> Kurosawa's </w> Throne of Blood, an adaptation of <w> Shakespeare's
</w> Macbeth. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#44:1>
Important artistic movements in our century, from surrealism,
expressionism and futurism, to abstract art, have felt the need to have a
dialogue with cinema.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#45:1>
Politicians from Lenin to Hitler and Mussolini have realised its
power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#46:1>
( In India in a state like Tamil Nadu, you do not know what came
first - - life or cinema!) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#47:1>
From political philosophy to transcendental metaphysics, cinema
has expressed it all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#48:1>
Its ability to syncretise would have been tested by <w> Eisenstein's
</w> unrealised project to make a film on <w> Marx's </w> <it> Capital </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#49:1>
Eisenstein wanted to make use of James <w> Joyce's </w> inner
monologue to compress material across centuries and civilisations, in one
day in the life of a worker.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#50:1>
This Griffin on a film was to have a tongue-in-cheek credit line:
<quote> " <it> <mention> Capital </mention> </it> , a film by Sergei
Eisenstein, based on the text of Karl Marx with a scenario by James
Joyce." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#51:1>
Cinema, from its birth has shown its capability to express with
equal ease the waking and dream states of human existence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#52:1>
In fact, its greatest achievements have come precisely from its
dual nature.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#53:1>
Its ability to record has enabled it to be a witness to our times
( to borrow a phrase of <w> Daumier's </w> ) as no other art form has done.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#54:1>
From two world wars to atomic explosions, famines, earthquakes, it
has recorded all that is terrible and that will be indissolubly associated
with our century.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#55:1>
It has also recorded with loving care our achievements in the
material world, when man broke his bondage to the earth and set foot on the
moon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#56:1>
It is a curious irony of history that one of the earliest films by
George Melies was an imaginary voyage to the moon and within a few decades,
cameras were recording the real voyage to the moon. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#57:1>
Not only has it recorded our reality, our history as we made it
with heroism and cowardice, with imagination and stupidity, with our heroes
and villains - - which other century has been its Grandhi and Hitler
recorded? - - but it has done much more. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#58:1>
It has been a witness to our cherished dreams as well as to our
perversions and nightmares.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#59:1>
The collective being watching the moving images in the realm of
shadows, lost to its own materiality as well as to that of the world around,
has seen its own unconscious projected on screens all over the weorld.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#60:1>
The film form has assumed the shape of the concrete-sensuous world as
well as the nebulous, ever changing aspects of our wishes, fears, passions
traumas and visions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#61:1>
From intensely personal expression to shameless spectacle, from
spiritual quest to sheer pornography, cinema has been it all. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#62:1>
Just as a human being, in the period that it spends in the womb,
experiences the entire history of evolution in a capsule form, cinema in its
100 years of non-solitude, has assumed all forms of life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#63:1>
Through the powers of animators, it has freed us from the tyranny
of the laws of gravity, relativity and causality.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#64:1>
It has in its dark halls, given us the power over objects and
events that alchemists, shamans and magicians have craved for centuries.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#65:1>
And yet, of all the art forms it seems to be the one most
threatened with extinction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#66:1>
Will there be cinema in the 21st century? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#67:1>
This is the question everyone who has been in love with cinema
is afraid to ask and yet must ask. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#68:1>
With the advances in technology, the spectacle is brought to
the viewer and there is no need for him to leave his home.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#69:1>
Theoretically, the entire population of the world can watch the
same event, just as it happens.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#70:1>
But with the <quote> ` one world' </quote> there is the media
control, the monopolies, the vast amounts and, to quote Tolstoy again,
<quote> " the toad - - the businessman" </quote> in whose belly goes on the
process of the impregnation and development of the seeds of the future.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#71:1>
Can we be as sure as he was at the turn of the century that these
seeds <quote> " will come out on <w> God's </w> earth and <*> dotted line</*>
begin their beautiful, brilliant lives all over again " </quote> ? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#72:1>
With access to a database of stored images, with possibilities of
all kinds of manipulation of these images through distortion, alteration,
combination of generated images with captured images, with simulation of the
sensuous world by computers, with the possibilities of holographs and
other types of 3-D imagery, it is difficult and hazardous to do any
crystal gazing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#73:1>
Practitioners of every art form, when challenged by some other
form with overlapping characteristics, have lended to be doomsday
prophets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-006#74:1>
But just as painting, threatened by still photography, freed itself
of certain tasks like creation of verisimilitude, cinema might find its
own solutions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-006#75:1>
If I have to write the scenario for the future of cinema, I would
rather either trust the miraculous powers of my hero or just write an open
ending. </p> <*> two red and black diamonds</*> </I>
