charged for the offence under session three nought two I P C <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#43:1:A>
The prosecution has examine in all <,> five witnesses and uh <,> he  
has canvassed before this court <,> that the reason for murder is that the  
deceased uh <,> <.> de </.> <,> uh declined and failed to <,> join the  
accused in his venture of pick-pocketing <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#44:1:A>
He has also at the outset canvass before this court <,> that there  
is no direct <,> eye witness to the incident <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#45:1:A>
The whole case of the prosecution rests <,> on the circumstantial  
evidence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#46:1:A>
He has further canvassed before this court that there are <,> uhn  
<,> according to him three dying declaration <,> one is <,> the dying  
declaration made uh before C M <,> <@> Vinod Jayanta Dhamankar </@> <,> at P  
W number one <,> the second dying declaration is in the nature of F I R 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#47:1:A>
And the third dying declaration <,> uh to her mother <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#48:1:A>
He has further canvassed that exhibit five <,> the dying  
declaration <,> was recorded by P W number one <,> uh Malankar which is in  
the question and answer form <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#49:1:A>
He has also canvassed at uh this stage that the defence may <,>  
object the prosecution that exhibit five has no endorsement of Dr <@> Ram  
</@> <,> P W number four <,> to show that whether the deceased was in a  
position to make dying declaration or not <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#50:1:A>
He has thus raised the query as to why the S E M was not uh  
suggested by the defence that he had <,> not obtained endorsement of P W  
number five Dr Miss <@> Maya </@> <,> <@> Krishnaram Ram </@> <,> uh <@>  
Krisnaram Ram </@> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#51:1:A>
What is the uhm necessity of obtaining endorsement of Dr uh uh <,>  
<@> Ram </@> <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#52:1:A>
P W number three has also stated that the deceased was uh uh <,,>  
with uh fifty-six percent burns on that <,> uh he has deposed that in such uh  
condition the patient will be <,,> in a position to speak and that according  
to him <,> P W number four has deposed before this court in his evidence <,,>  
uh in his evidence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#53:1:A>
He has also canvassed <,> uhn before this court that uh P W number  
two the mother of the deceased who uh <,> also states that the patient was in  
a position to speak <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#54:1:A>
There is no suggestion made by the defence to P W number one and  
two that whether the patient was in a position to speak or not <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#55:1:A>
Uh he has then canvassed before this court that this court shall  
also consider the conduct of the accused <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#56:1:A>
That the accused has reported the incident to P W number two <,>  
the mother of the deceased after going to her house <,> and then telling that  
he would bring some money for medicine and went away and he did not return  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#57:1:A>
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court as to  
why the accused ran away on the <,> pretext of uh bringing uh money from uh  
for medicine <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#58:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> E E </.> </-> <=> if </=> </}> <,> according to <,> him  
the accused had not <}> <-> <.> commi </.> </-> uh <=> committed </=> </}>  
the offence of throwing the uh <,> lighted match-stick on the person of the  
deceased 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#59:1:A>
He would not have uh <,> he would not certainly run away <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#60:1:A>
Uh he has also canvassed before this court that the deceased had  
<}> <-> actual <-> <+> actually </+> </}> talked with P W number two <,> <->  
which uh </-> which according to learned special P P is third dying  
declaration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#61:1:A>
He has also invited the attention of this court that the deceased  
had uh <,> deposed <,> the truth uh uh truth how the <}> <-> <.> accu </.> uh  
</-> <=> accused </=> </}> set her <,> on fire <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#62:1:A>
There is no suggestion to P W number two <,> that her daughter was  
unconscious <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#63:1:A>
He had also canvassed before this court <,,> uh that P W number  
three is <@> Suresh Krishnaram Bane </@> who has uh <}> <-> preferred the <.>  
po </.> </-> <=> performed the </=> </}> post mortem and that he has examined  
<,,> her to bring on record the post mortem notes <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#64:1:A>
The learned special P P has further canvassed before this court  
that P W number uh four Dr <@> Maya Ram </@> has deposed <,> in her uh <,>  
examination which was suggested <,> to her to which she has replied that <,>  
uh on the left upper limb there was uh <,> zero percent <,> zero percent  
burns <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#65:1:A>
The learned special P P then canvassed before this court that P W  
number five <O> one word </O> was at that time on duty and he recorded his  
own statement <O> two words </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#66:1:A>
He has also canvassed before this court that uh here again Dr has  
endorsed that the patient was in a position to speak on the <O> one word </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#67:1:A>
Exhibit sixteen and uh these confirm and supported by P W number  
four <@> Maya Ram </@> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#68:1:A>
The learned special P P has then canvassed before this court  
regarding the <indig> panchanama </indig> exhibit A that is the scene of  
offence uh of <indig> panchnama </indig> which is the nature of corroborative  
evidence on as the article uh <indig> saree </indig> blouse bottle <,>  
match-box etcetera that is in all six articles <,> were uh <,> recovered and  
had shown in <,> in exhibit eighteen that there was kerosene on these  
articles <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#69:1:A>
Lastly the learned special P P has canvassed before this court <,>  
that all the threee dying declarations are consistent and uhm <,> there is no  
different version in this respect <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#70:1:A>
Uh according to him each one of the dying declaration is sufficient  
to prove the guilt of the accused uh <,,> independently <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#71:1:A>
He has also canvassed before this court that about the conduct of  
the accused that uh <,> by not remaining present in the hospital uh <,>  
hospital <,> <}> <-> show </-> <+> Shows </+> </}> that it is the accused  
only who is uh <,> responsible for <,,> this offence 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#72:1:A>
He has also canvassed before this court <,> that the neighbours of  
the deceased removed the deceased to K E M hospital and not the accused as it  
should <,> uh should have been <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#73:1:A>
The learned special P P therefore has <-> strong </-> uh seriously  
urged <,> that he has proved the <,> charge beyond a reasonable doubt against  
the accused and that the accused <,> may be dealt uh with accordingly <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#74:1:A>
Miss <@> Dwivedi Trivedi the learned special P P <,,> <&> clears  
troat </&> uh appearing for the <}> <-> <.> def </.> uh </-> <=> defence </=>  
</}> <,> has canvassed before this court <,,> that there is no direct eye  
witness to the incident 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#75:1:A>
She has canvassed before this court that the accused was charged  
for the offence under section three nought seven I P C <,> at the outset <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#76:1:A>
And that the charge uh <,> appears to have been uh altered to  
section three nought two uh I P C <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#77:1:A>
She has also canvassed before this court that this is a case of  
circumstantial evidence <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#78:1:A>
She has also canvassed before this court that <,> on the first  
dying declaration recorded by P W number one <,> there is no endorsement of  
the doctor <,> to the effect that the deceased was in a position to speak and  
to make the dying declaration <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#79:1:A>
She has also canvassed before this court that the doctors  
endorsement is necessary to show <,> that patient was in a position to speak 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#80:1:A>
The second uh point which the learned defence council has canvassed  
before this court is about <,> uh procuring of kerosene bottle which  
according to her <,> is silent <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#81:1:A>
Uh the <indig> panchnama </indig> showed that the plastic was  
containing kerosene 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#82:1:A>
The learned defence council <,,> relied on the evidence of P W  
number two and has stated <,> that the deceased poured kerosene uh from the  
kerosene lamp article four 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#83:1:A>
The learned defence council further canvassed before this court <,>  
that regarding the seizure of articles <,> the blouse <,> article number  
three ought to have been <,> burnt if the deceased had burn injuries from  
chest to abdomen <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#84:1:A>
However according to the learned defence council looking to the  
evidence of P W number one to five <,> she has canvassed that the blouse  
article three is not burnt but it is torn <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#85:1:A>
She has also invited the attention of this <}> <- > <.> cou </.>  
<,> uh </-> <=> court </=> </}> to the two <indig> sarees </indig> in this  
case and raised the query as to how two <indig> sarees </indig> are taken  
charge of <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#86:1:A>
The deceased cannot <,> be expected to wear two <indig> sarees  
</indig> uh <,> at one and the same time 

<ICE-IND:S2A-070#87:1:A>
Therefore according to her <,> it creates doubt about this case in  
view of the <,> uh production of two <indig> sarees </indig> by the  
prosecution </I>
