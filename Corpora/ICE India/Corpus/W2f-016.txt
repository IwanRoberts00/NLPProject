<ICE-IND:W2F-016#3:1>
That night Ashok dreamt.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#4:1>
He was always a prolific dreamer, often going through several
full-length episodes in one night, and <indig> Swamiji </indig> had told him
to watch his dreams, especially the vivid ones that are still remembered
after one wakes up.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#5:1>
Such dreams, <indig> Swamiji </indig> had said, give us clues into the
true state of our inner life which the conscious mind very often suppresses.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#6:1>
It often needed the help of a skilled teacher to read the dream
symbols correctly, and Ashok had recorded and sent several of his dreams to
<indig> Swamiji </indig> who had returned them with his deeply perceptive
comments. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#7:1>
In the dreams that night in Pahalgam, with the sound of the Lidder
flowing close by, Ashok found himself on the banks of a huge, untamed river.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#8:1>
It seemed to be flowing across a vast plain, and he came upon it
without any warning as he was walking alone in some sort of a desert.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#9:1>
He looked around, but there was no sign of a bridge or boat.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#10:1>
He wondered how he was ever going to cross it, and he felt a sense of
panic that he might be trapped there forever. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#11:1>
Suddenly he saw two figures coming along the bank towards him,
one of them much larger than the other.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#12:1>
They were conversing deeply, and as they neared he found, to his
surprise, that they were Maharaj and Madan.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#13:1>
He could see Maharaj striding along in his ochre robe, his hair
blowing up behind him, forming a sort of golden halo against the light.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#14:1>
Madan was dressed in white, and moved with easy elegance alongside
<O> <&> page </&> 79 </O> his master.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#15:1>
They walked past him as if he wasn't there, and though he tried to
call out to them no words escaped his lips. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#16:1>
As soon as they passed him, they disappeared.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#17:1>
Ashok was distraught.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#18:1>
He ran down along the bank of that huge torrent calling out to them
aloud, but they had vanished without a trace.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#19:1>
Ashok felt a sense of loss and sadness so deep that he threw himself
on the ground and broke into tears.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#20:1>
The moment he did this he felt something brush his back and, jumping
up with a start, saw the great golden eagle that he had noticed at <quote> `
Harvan' </quote> a few days earlier.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#21:1>
The eagle circled around him and flew off as if asking Ashok to
follow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#22:1>
After what seemed to be an interminable run stumbling through the
stones and boulders that littered the river bank, Ashok suddenly saw what
looked like a narrow bridge of many-coloured lights-rather like a
rainbow-going across the river in a great arc.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#23:1>
Maharaj and Madan, continuing their conversation, were already half
way across the bridge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#24:1>
Before Ashok could follow them he heard a vehicle approaching,
throwing up clouds of dust as it neared.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#25:1>
It was a Land Rover; Ramesh was driving and Sheila was in the front
seat, while in the back were a pair of labradors, one black and the other
yellow.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#26:1>
They were evidently trying to say something to him, but their words
made no sense, as if they were speaking in some unknown tongue.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#27:1>
Ashok dropped the knapsack he was carrying, swiftly stripped until he
was entirely naked, and raced towards the bridge of light.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#28:1>
It was getting fainter.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#29:1>
Maharaj and Madan had almost reached the other side.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#30:1>
The great bird dived past him as if urging him on.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#31:1>
He felt the chill of the water, heard the sound of the great river,
crash in his ears and, with all the strength left in him, jumped towards the
disappearing bridge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#32:1>
<quote> " Wake up, Ashok, wake up." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#33:1>
Ashok heard the voice <O> <&> page </&> 80 </O> as if coming out of
anaesthesia.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#34:1>
For a moment he was not sure whether he was awake or asleep.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#35:1>
Then he felt <w> Ramesh's </w> hand ruffle his hair.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#36:1>
<quote> " Wake up!

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#37:1>
For <w> God's </w> sake, <w> what's </w> the matter?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#38:1>
Ashok shook his head and looked at his watch.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#39:1>
It was three in the morning. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#40:1>
<quote> " Ramesh, what are you doing here?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#41:1>
<quote> " You were shouting so much in your sleep that we thought
you were dying or something.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#42:1>
<w> We're </w> next door, and Sheils sent me to investigate.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#43:1>
Are you sure <w> you're </w> all right?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#44:1>
<quote> " I <*> dotted lines</*> <w> I'm </w> sorry to have
disturbed you, Ramesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#45:1>
I must have had one of my vivid dreams.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#46:1>
Really, <w> I'm </w> quite all right.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#47:1>
Many thanks for coming, though." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#48:1>
On an impulse Ramesh bent down and kissed him on the forehead.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#49:1>
<quote> " Good night, Ashok," </quote> he said.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#50:1>
He switched off the light as he went out. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#51:1>
Ashok lay back in his bed, touched by <w> Ramesh's </w> gesture,
pondering over the dream he still vividly recalled.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#52:1>
The impact was quite clear to him even without <indig> <w> Swamiji's
</w> </indig> interpretation.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#53:1>
He had to shed entirely his present way of life and follow Maharaj
if he was ever to cross the turbulent river of Time, flowing relentlessly and
eternally.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#54:1>
He would have to give up his job, his friends and his association
with Ramesh and Sheila.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#55:1>
And he had to do it soon, or the bridge would disappear and he would
be left for God knows how many more lifetimes in the future. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#56:1>
They left for Srinagar at about ten, planning to get into the
hotel by one.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#57:1>
Ashok needed one final meeting with Maharaj before he took the
plunge, and hoped that he would be able to get away to the <indig> Ashrama
</indig> in the afternoon.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#58:1>
As if reading his mind, Ramesh cut in. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#59:1>
<quote> " This afternoon we are having high tea with the
Rustomjees.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#60:1>

<quote> " No, Ramesh, I have to go and see Maharaj.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#62:1>
Besides, who are the Rustomijees?

I don't even know them." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#64:1>
<quote> " Don't know the Rustomjees, how is that possible?"
</quote> said Ramesh.

institution in Srinagar.

<w> They've </w> lived here for God knows how many decades, run a

good people that they have endeared themselves to Kashmiris and non-Kashmiris
alike.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#67:1>
My father used to supply some goods to them and they became good
friends.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#68:1>
I called them before we left Srinagar and they were delighted.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#69:1>
They saw me last when I was a teenager and are dying to see how I
look and how my wife looks." </quote> </p>

<p>

<quote> " OK.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#71:1>
OK.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#72:1>
You two carry on, but please leave me out.

I really have to see Maharaj." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#74:1>
<quote> " Out of the question," </quote> said Ramesh with an air
of finality.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#75:1>
<quote> " You can go and see your precious Maharaj after tea."
</quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#76:1>
Ramesh was sitting in the front of the taxi as he always liked
doing.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#77:1>
An excellent driver himself, he hated taking the back seat even if he
wasn't driving.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#78:1>
Ashok looked helplessly at Sheila.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#79:1>
Ramesh caught his glance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#80:1>
<quote> " <w> It's </w> no use appealing to Sheila, Ashok.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#81:1>
I must get you to meet the Rustomjees.

They are so sweet and such excellent company.

Her English is a little wonky, but promise that you won't laugh at
it." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#84:1>
<quote> " All right, <w> I'll </w> come," </quote> said Ashok,
<quote> " but I will have to leave soon after tea and get up to the <indig>
Ashrama </indig> before it gets dark.

What time is it?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#86:1>
<quote> " Five <w> O'clock </w> , and when Mr. Rustomjee says
five <w> that's </w> exactly what he means." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#87:1>
Ashok had a strange feeling of <foreign> <it> deja vu </it>
</foreign> , as if all this had happened before in a dream.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#88:1>
Perhaps it was a premonition that in some way the Rustomjees were a
small but vital part in his new life.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#89:1>
Whatever it was, the <O> <&> page </&> 82 </O> feeling persisted
until they finally reached the hotel.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#90:1>
After a quick but excellent buffet lunch Ashok excused himself and
went off to his room, promising to meet in the foyer at a quarter to five.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#91:1>
Ramesh looked at the retreating figure, then turned to Sheila.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#92:1>
<quote> " I really can't understand this guy," </quote> he said,
<quote> " though <w> I've </w> known him now ever since we were boys.

<w> What's </w> his problem, why can't he stick to his job, get
married and live happily ever after?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#94:1>
<quote> " Happiness means different things to different
people, Ramesh.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#95:1>
He is evidently deeply committed to the spiritual quest, and
everything else has become for him essentially meaningless." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#96:1>
<quote> " Did he tell you that?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#97:1>
<quote> " Yes, in so many words.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#98:1>
He also told me about the school incident, Ramesh.

I managed with great difficulty to get it out of him.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#100:1>
He was very reluctant to speak of it." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#101:1>
Ramesh was silent for a long while.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#102:1>

<w> That's </w> really going to be fun." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#116:1>
They reached the Rustomjee home exactly at five.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#117:1>
The taxi left them on the main road, from where they walked up to
along the Bund, the embankment along the Jhelum river that had over the years
become the most fashionable shopping area in town.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#118:1>
They walked along for about two hundred yards passing hordes of
tourists crossing the shops, until they came to a sign: <quote> "
J.Rustomjee: General Merchant". </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2F-016#119:1>
<quote> " This is it," </quote> said Ramesdh as he rang the
doorbell.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#120:1>
It was flung open and the Rustomjees were there to enfold them in

They settled down in the roomy Kashmiri wicker sofas covered

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#137:1>
The furniture and lamps were all Kahsmiri walnut, the carpets and
local durries known as <indig> <it> namdahs </it> </indig> were a delight,

Tea was served out of a large silver Kashmiri samovar.

It was delicious.

Mrs. Rustomjee chattered away without a break.

<ICE-IND:W2F-016#152:1>
The conversation turned to politics, and to a figure who was
becoming increasingly prominent in political life. </p>

At this point a Kashmiri waiter came in with plates loaded with
pastries, sandwiches and a delicious local short bread known as <indig> <it>
