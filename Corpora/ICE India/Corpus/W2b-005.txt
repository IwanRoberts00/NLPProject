<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#4:1>
WE INDULGE in so many kinds of pursuits in India today, of
which the most important, and, to many people, the only one, is <it> the
pursuit of money-making </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#5:1>
The pursuit of money, the pursuit of pleasure, and the pursuit of
power - - these three pursuits have frozen our hearts all these forty-five
years of our post-independence existence, and have almost destroyed the
creative spirit of our people and taken the nation to the brink of despair.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#6:1>
This evil tendency can be reversed only by a new pursuit, which will
help to purify all other pursuits and destroy whatever is evil in them;
<it> and that new pursuit is the pursuit of human excellence. </it> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#7:1>
<h> <bold> The Ethical Education of our Children </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#8:1>
A new India is coming up in our children of the present
generation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#9:1>
They are unlike the children of the earlier generations; they have
more of what our <indig> Vedanta </indig> calls the energy of <indig> <it>
rajoguna </it> </indig> in place of the inertia of <indig> <it> tamoguna
</it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#10:1>
They are more intelligent, more vivacious, more alert, more fearless,
and more straightforward; these are sterling character assets, and
represent the early stages of <w> man's </w> spiritual growth, according to
Swami Vivekananda.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#11:1>
But they are deficient in social sense, in social responsibility, and
in the concern for other individuals and groups; they also exhibit more
than the healthy level of crudeness, intolerance, and aggressiveness,
revealing the divorce of the energy of culture from the energy of
education.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#12:1>
The result is that they have become a problem to themselves and a
problem to the nation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#13:1>
These traits reveal a character in which, as our <indig> <it> Vedanta
</it> </indig> puts it, <indig> <it> rajas </it> </indig> is till under the
control of <indig> <it> tamas </it> </indig> ; they need to go one step
further in their spiritual growth by which their <indig> <it> rajas </it>
</indig> will be brought under the control of <indig> <it> sattva </it>
</indig> and their <indig> <it> tamas </it> </indig> under the control of
<indig> <it> rajas </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#14:1>
Our older generation, with their largely feudal mental makeup, can
hardly become fit example for our younger generation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#15:1>
From the lure of a dead past, therefore, our youths have to be
summoned to face the hardships and challenges of the living present and
shoulder the responsible and creative roles of ushering in the delights
of a glorious future.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#16:1>
Their energies, now functioning destructively like indisciplined
demental forces such as we experience in floods and earthquakes, need to
be made creative and responsible, by selfdiscipline through a
socially-oriented will. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#17:1>
Our scientific technology is engaged in disciplining these
elemental forces of nature to enhance human happiness and welfare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#18:1>
We need a similar spiritual technology to discipline the energies
of our youths to enhance their own and the <w> nation's </w> welfare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#19:1>
<it> This is the ethical education of our children, by which they are
made to feel the weight of social responsibility for the rebuilding of their
national body-politic, by which they learn to have a creative and
constructive direction to their <O> page </&> 6 </O> enormous energies now
expressing largely in destructive and self-cancelling ways, and by which they
not only cease to be the despair, but become the shining hope, of the nation.
</it> </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#20:1>
<h> <bold> <indig> Tyaga </indig> and <indig> Seva </indig> </bold>
</h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#21:1>
Human excellence was the constant theme of Swami Vivekananda.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#22:1>
He will wel come this spirit of <indig> <it> rajas </it> </indig>
in our younger generation today, but will also whisper the energy of his
<indig> Vedantic </indig> message into every one of them to raise his or her
energies to the higher level of <indig> <it> sattva </it> </indig> through
selfdiscipline and cultivation of ethical and social awareness.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#23:1>
That energy then will find expression in a socially oriented will and
purpose and dedication, with its constant and spontaneous mood and temper
of <indig> <it> tyaga </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> seva </it> </indig> - -
renunciation and service. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#24:1>
This <indig> <it> tyaga </it> </indig> and <indig> <it> seva
</it> </indig> is the first fruit of all true education and all true religion
from which it issues spontaneously and naturally without the feeling of being
forced to sacrifice and without expecting special external inducements to
prop it up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#25:1>
Herein we see palpably the spiritual growth of man and the dynamic
march of human evolution, beyond the organic level to the psychosocial
level, as envisaged in twentiethcentury biology.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#26:1>
Where this dynamic evolutionary movement is absent, human life gets
stuck up in worldliness and becomes stagnant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#27:1>
Such stagnation is spiritual death, says <indig> Vedanta </indig> ;
and it is more to be feared than physical death, by a species so high in
the scale of evolution as man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#28:1>
<indig> Sri </indig> <bold> Ramakrishna exhorts man to avoid this
pitfall of spiritual death; says he: </bold>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#29:1>
<quote> " Live in <indig> <it> samsara </it> </indig> , or the world;
but allow not <indig> <it> samsara </it> </indig> , or worldliness, to get
into you; that will make you stagnant.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#30:1>
A boat will be on the water; that is its natural place; but water
should not be allowed to get into the boat; that will render it stagnant and
unfit for the purpose for which it is meant" </quote> . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#31:1>
<h> <bold> The <indig> Grihastha </indig> Spiritually Growing into
the Citizen </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#32:1>
In this illustrative teaching, <indig> Sri </indig> Ramakrishna
has compressed the entire message of social ethics and practical religion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#33:1>
It envisages the <indig> <it> grihastha </it> </indig> , or the
householder, <it> evolving into the citizen; </it> it exhorts the
biologically and physically conditioned man or woman to <bold> grow into
the freedom and expansiveness of the spirituality of </bold> citizenship,
which manifests itself as renunciation and service, <indig> <it> tyaga </it>
</indig> and <indig> <it> seva </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#34:1>
This is the type of men and women that we have to turn out in
increasing numbers in our society today.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#35:1>
When we do so, we lay the foundations of the new democratic
edifice of our nation on rock.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#36:1>
But, today, it has only sand for its base; and it is certain that as
remarked by Jesus in his parable ( Matthew, 7, 2427) a building built
on sand cannot stand. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#37:1>
<h> <bold> National Development : Economic <it> versus </it> Human
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#38:1>
Today we have to ask this very question; On what base are we
to build up the structure of our Indian national life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#39:1>
That structure is <bold> already rising here, there, everywhere,
through our mighty </bold> developmental programmes in the field of
educational expansion, scientific research, industrial and agricultural
development, defence, and social welfare.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#40:1>
By the end of this century, we shall have solved many of our economic
and social problems, the problems relating to the external environment in
which human life is set.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#41:1>
But one problem will remain, and will become more intractable as we
advance in the solution of our environmental problems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#42:1>
It relates to the great question as to what is the type of man that
will come out of all this development?

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#43:1>
Is he or she going to be a clever crooky person, whose increased
knowledge tends to the exploitation of other people?

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#44:1>
A worldly individual, whose centre of <O> <&> page </&> 7 </O>
interest <bold> is always in his or her little self inside, whose centre
of gravity </bold> is always in the profits and pleasures outside of himself
or herself, and who has become stagnant in the world of sensate
satisfactions?

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#45:1>
Or is he or she to be a dynamic person continuing his or her
evolution in the psychosocial levels, who is, accordingly, sensitive to
higher values and strives to realize them, and who has achieved, or its
<bold> striving to achieve, the three-fold integrations referred to by the
late Bertrand Russell, namely </bold> , integration between the self and
society, between the self and nature outside, and between the diverse
forces within the self itself? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#46:1>
This central problem of society, namely, <it> the problem of
human excellence </it> , must be tackled from now onwards - - the type of
men and women that we want to see in the India that is emerging.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#47:1>
If that India is to continue her glorious past into a still more
glorious future, she will have to achieve a synthesis of the tested and
enduring elements of her own tradition with the finest elements of the modern
Western tradition.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#48:1>
<it> This meeting of East and West was achieved in a big way in Swami
Vivekananda </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#49:1>
Referring to Vivekananda in his <it> <mention> Life of Vivekananda
</mention> </it> as the embodied unity of a nation containing a hundred
different nations ( p. 314 ) , Romain Rolland says ( ibid, p. 310 ) :

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#50:1>
<bold> <quote> " In the two words equilibrium and synthesis, <w>
Vivekananda's </w> constructive genius </bold> may be summed up.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#51:1>
He embraced all the paths of the spirit: the four <indig> Yogas
</indig> in their entirety, renunciation and service, art and science,
religion and action from the most spiritual to the most practical <*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#52:1>

<h> <bold> The Meeting of East and West in Every Citizen </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#54:1>
Every Indian citizen today must achieve this synthesis in a
measure in himself or herself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#55:1>
Vivekananda exhorts every Indian to strive in this direction ( <it>
<mention> The Complete Work </mention> </it> , Vol. V. Eighth Editiion. P.
29-30) :

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#56:1>
<quote> " Can you become an occidental of occidentals in your
spirit of equality, freedom, work and energy, and at the same time a Hindu to
the very backbone in religious culture and instincts?

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#57:1>
This is to be done and we will do it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#58:1>
<it> You are all born to do it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#59:1>
Have faith in yourselves; great convictions are the mothers of
great deeds </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#60:1>
Onwards for ever - - sympathy for the poor, the downtrodden, even
unto death this is our motto." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#61:1>
This is the type of glory and greatness; that should descend upon
men and women in India, in general, and upon politicians and the members of
the administrative services of the Centre and the States, in particular will
make for the liberation of the spirit of service as a pervasive principle,
lighting up the prevailing dark and dismal horizon of our nation and raising
the spiritual quality of the life of its citizens.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#62:1>
To go here and there to be spiritual is like going here and there to
breathe.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#63:1>
It is all <it> here and now </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#64:1>
We have to realize that spirituality is not miracle-mongering, or
magic, or cheap mysticism; it is not to be sought merely in caves and forest
but that it is the birthright of one and all, and is to be cultivated in
the fields of one life and work, in the midst of its ups and downs. </p> <&>

Our people need to be inspired by this practical, ennobling, and
realizable ideal which Vivekananda has put before us in the modern age.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#67:1>
He exhorts us that it is far better to live for an ideal for an
instant than to lead the life of jellyfish existence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#68:1>
In the following passage from the Mahabharata, uttered by queen

Some of the great men of India, like Sankara and Vivekananda,
lived <it> short but intense lives </it> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#71:1>
Theirs was an intense dedication to God and man, to God in man; and
it changed the course of human history.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#72:1>
It is better to live intensely for an ideal and vision than to <bold>
vegetate for long years in a humdrum existence.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#73:1>
This is a powerful </bold> sentiment that can drive away the clouds
of cynicism and frustration from the sky of India.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#74:1>
Every educated citizen has to teach himself or herself that he or she
not only is <it> in </it> India but is also <it> of </it> India and <it> for
</it> India, and is responsible for the <w> nation's </w> wellbeing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#75:1>
We have to inspire ourselves with the conviction that we have been
called upon <bold> to be an instrument of our <w> nation's </w> purposes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#76:1>
What can be a greater </bold> glory for man in India today than this,
that he or she is living in the most creative period of his or her <w>
nation's </w> long history, and that he or she is privileged to contribute
to it, big or small.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#77:1>
When cynicism and frustration lay their cold hand of death on a
person, he or she is unable to respond to any higher value, and becomes
suspicious of all values, except <w> one's </w> own self-interest. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#78:1>
<h> <bold> Conclusion </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-005#79:1>
We have a long and impressive history and a very rich cultural
tradition; and our great thinkers have plunged into life, and into the heart
of experience, and given us visions of human excellence which can inspire any
culture or civilization.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#80:1>
But, for centuries together, we failed to live up to these visions
and became stagnant; and from that stagnation, we were rescued by our
contact with the modern Western culture.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#81:1>
As a result, for over a hundred years now, our society has been
passing through the tremendous experience of an <bold> awakening, a
pervasive renaissance, in the course of which we have </bold> been
reassessing our own inherited values and comparing them with the values which
we have received from the West.

<ICE-IND:W2B-005#82:1>
A small minority of great minds in India such as Mahatma Gandhi have
been able to get a grip on our great national tradition and assimilate
into it the tested elements of the Western tradition; and they stand as
the great pathfinders for the rest of the Indian society, including the
large number of those who have got stuck up in the weak and harmful and
stagnant elements of their own national tradition, and of those others who
have become blinded by the cheap and equally harmful and stagnant elements of
the modern Western tradition; for this minority <it> has synthesized, in
themselves, the finest excellences of </it> character of both the East and
the West, and demonstrated to our nation that this modern transition in India
can be made purposive and fruitful, if the Indian child is given the guidance
to understand the dynamic nature of the modern transition in India and to
assimilate these two elements in his or her character. </p> <*> filled
