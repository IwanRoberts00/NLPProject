Justice Dinshaw Mehta <,,> <O> one word </O> honourable  
Chancellor of the University <,,> <O> clears throat </O> Vice- Chancellor  
Professor Dhanagare <,,> distinguished members of the management <,> and  
Academic Councils <,,> deens of the faculty of the university <,> members of  
the senate <,> staff of the university <,,> young students of the university  
who are graduating today <,> distinguished guest <,> ladies and gentleman  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#2:1:A>
I am deeply thankful for the invitation extended to me by the  
Shivaji University <,,> to address the thirty-fifth <,> Annual Convocation of  
this great University <,,> whose achievements <,,> I was very happy to hear  
<,,> when the Vice- Chancellor presented his report both in Marathi and in  
English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#3:1:A>
I consider it a previlege <,,> and feel greatly honoured for the  
invitation to give the Convocation Address <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#4:1:A>
And let me tell you <,> I think it a greater previlege than the  
<mention> Padmavibhusan </mention> which you may here not be concerned <,,>  
<O> laughter </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#5:1:A>
I am no stranger to Maharashtra <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#6:1:A>
<w> I've </w> lived the better part of my life in Bombay where I  
still have a home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#7:1:A>
My most favourite hill stations are Matheran and Mahabaleshwar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#8:1:A>
In Mahabaleshwar I have a country home <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#9:1:A>
I am in every sense a Maharashtranian <,,> <&> a few words in  
Marathi </&> <,,> <O> laughter </O> <&> a few words in Marathi </&> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#10:1:A>
From my younger days Shivaji <indig> Maharaj </indig> <,> has been  
my hero <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#11:1:A>
And I keenly <O> applause </O> <,,> and I keenly look forward to  
and immensely enjoyed the visits to Pratapgarh fort <,,> from Maharashtra we  
used to go <,,> Mahabaleshwar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#12:1:A>
Pratapgarh fort and its surroundings <,> which never failed to  
inspire me <,,> and remind me of the brave deeds <,,> the wise statesmanship  
<,,> and the <,> spirit of <,> tolerance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#13:1:A>
I repeat <,> the spirit of tolerance <,,> of <indig> Chhatrapati  
Shivaji Maharaj </indig> <,,> which should guide us and inspire us all <,> in  
this present age <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#14:1:A>
I have a certain association at Kolhapur <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#15:1:A>
<indig> Maharaja </indig> of Kolhapur had his racing horses in uh  
<,> he used to race in Bombay <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#16:1:A>
I had my own race horses <,> and Pandu Khade <,> was my Jockey <O>  
applause </O> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#17:1:A>
So Kolhapur has this association to hang <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#18:1:A>
Now may I extend before I go further my congratulations my hearty  
congratulations <,> and best wishes <,,> to those students who are graduating  
out today <,> from the halls of these great university <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#19:1:A>
I have no doubt <,,> that the training they have received <,,> and  
the traditions <,,> they have imbibed in this university <,,> will serve them  
well <,,> in facing the challenges of life hereafter <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#20:1:A>
Friends I believe <,,> that the future <,> belongs to the young  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#21:1:A>
The future of India <,,> is in the youth of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#22:1:A>
I have great faith in the youth of India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#23:1:A>
Youth <,> which has ideals <,,> which has vision <,,> and which is  
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism <,,> or the malady of  
materialism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#24:1:A>
Preservation of democracy and democratic values <,> and protection  
and promotion of human rights <,,> are matters with which everyone of us not  
merely lawyers and judges and journalists <,> everyone of us is or should be  
concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#25:1:A>
It is the legitimate pride of every Indian <,,> and I feel that  
pride when I go abroad <,> and an uh <,> attend international conferences <,>  
and conventions <,,> that despite the trials <,> turmoils and tribulations  
<,,> which our nation has undergone <,,> democracy <,> the rule of law <,>  
and respect for human rights <,> by and large are preserved and respected in  
our country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#26:1:A>
And I think that is something about which every Indian <,,> should  
feel proud of <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#27:1:A>
The topic of my address is <mention> The role of lawyers and the  
judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights </mention>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#28:1:A>
Now the problems <,> the perennial problem <,,> of orderly  
government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by Madison  
<,,> who was one of the founding fathers of the American Constitution <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#29:1:A>
He stated <,,> in the Federalist <,,> and I quote <,,> <quote> In  
framing a government <,,> which is to be administered by men over men <,,>  
the great difficulty lies in this <,,> you must first enable the government  
to control the governed <,,> and in the next place oblige the government to  
control itself <,,> </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#30:1:A>
Over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not  
obliging <,> and do not control themselves <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#31:1:A>
The great difficulty mentioned by Madison confronts our country in  
a large measure <,,> as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary  
decencies to all persons <,,> whilst respecting the rule of law <,> and the  
independence of the judiciary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#32:1:A>
Despite the <w> law's </w> horrendous delays <,,> and a multitude  
of deficiencies which plague the Indian legal system <,,> it is curious <,,>  
but also heartening <,,> that the public still retains confidence in the  
judiciary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#33:1:A>
It is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from  
legislative excesses <,> and executive abuses <,,> and for vindication of his  
or her rights against the State <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#34:1:A>
An independant judiciary is one of the pillars <,,> of our  
constitutional edifice <,,> and is indispensible to a democracy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#35:1:A>
It is a constitutional <,> and a moral imperative for the  
protection of human rights of the citizens <,,> for maintenance of the rule  
of law <,,> and for preservation of democratic values <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#36:1:A>
And the essence of independence of judges is <,,> there is  
adjudication of disputes between citizens <,,> and between citizens and the  
State <,> and the State is the biggest litigant today <,,> judges must act  
impartially <,,> and be free from pressure <,,> or influence of any kind <,>  
emanating from any source <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#37:1:A>
What kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised <,,> for  
the high judicial office? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#38:1:A>
Pandit Nehru spoke for all of them when he said <,> and I quote  
<,,> <quote> Judges should be not only first rate <,,> but should be  
acknowledged <,> to be first rate in the country <,,> and of the highest  
integrity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#39:1:A>
And if necessary <,,> people who can stand up against the executive  
government <,,> and whoever may come in their way <,,> </quote> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#40:1:A>
Now in order to ensure the independence of the <,> higher judiciary  
<,,> our Constitution provides for security of tenure namely <,> sixty-two  
years in the case of High Court judge <,,> and sixty-five years in the case  
of a Supreme Court judge <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#41:1:A>
Frankly I have not been able to understand this sixty-two and  
sixty-five <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#42:1:A>
I don't think there is anything in the High Court <,> wherby at  
sixty-two the judge become <O> one word </O> and at sixty-five the Supreme  
Court judges still go on <,> but <w> that's </w> another thing <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#43:1:A>
Judges <,> as you know cannot be removed <,> at the pleasure of the  
executive <,,> but only by a procedure provided in the Constitution which is  
popularly known <,,> or called the process of impeachment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#44:1:A>
Remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot  
be altered by the government of the day <,,> except by constitutional  
amendment <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#45:1:A>
So these are the main bulwarks <,,> to insulate judges from  
executive pressure <,,> and to relieve them from being dependent on the  
government <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#46:1:A>
But executive <,> influences operate in a variety of subtle ways  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#47:1:A>
For example the prospect of appointment after retirement <,,> to  
some statutory body <,> or council <,> or commission <,> and sometimes the  
prospect <,> of the office of the governor <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#48:1:A>
It is my view <,,> that the Supreme Court <,,> and High Court  
judges after retirement <,,> should not be given any assignment <,> nor  
appointed to any body or tribunal <,,> which is subordinate to the High Court  
or the Supreme Court <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#49:1:A>
It is an unseemly sight <,> to witness legal challenges to the  
orders of former Supreme Court judges <,> in the High Court or in the Supreme  
Court <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#50:1:A>
The proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement  
<,,> and to avail of their services <,> today they don't even get full  
pension <,> they get only half pension <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#51:1:A>
And to avail of their services in national interest <,,> for  
example heading a commission of enquiry <,> in a matter of vital national  
importance <,> as and when the occasion arises <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#52:1:A>
It is also my view <,,> that the present retirement age of the High  
Court and Supreme Court judges <,> needs to be increased <,,> so that the  
experience <,,> and abilities of the serving judges may be utilised <,,>  
rather than lose them <,> at the early age of sixty-two and sixty-five <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#53:1:A>
In most countries following the common law tradition <,,> the usual  
retirement age is seventy years <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#54:1:A>
Friends I do not desire to list <,> all the qualities a judge  
should possess <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#55:1:A>
But the foremost quality required <,,> in deciding constitutional  
issues is <,,> that the judge must be attuned <,,> to the philosophy of our  
<,> philosophy of our constitution <,,> which is succinctly <,,> and  
admirably encapsulated in the Preamble <,,> and amplified in the chapter on  
<mention> Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles </mention> <,> which  
taken together <,> constitute <,> the core and conscience of our Constitution  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#56:1:A>
We may and should <,> should seek lights <,,> from judgements of  
the courts in the United Kingdom <,> in the United States <,> Canada <,>  
Australia <,> New Zealand <,> South Africa <,,> another developing country  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#57:1:A>
It is important to have exposure <,> to judgements of national  
courts of other country <,> as also the judgements of regional and  
international tribunals <,,> and understand their approach <,,> to the  
solution of problems <,,> specially in the field of human rights <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#58:1:A>
But ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation  
in the light of our historical background <&> recording broken </&>  
independence is <,,> that the <-> judge must </-> judge must be independent  
of himself or herself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#59:1:A>
In other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously  
avoid <,,> being influenced by the preconceived notions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#60:1:A>
It is a difficult task <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#61:1:A>
Have judges maintained <,,> the cold neutrality of an impartial  
judge <,,> as was Edmund <w> Burke's </w> perception? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#62:1:A>
Let us be realistic <,,> judges like you and me are human beings  
<,> cannot expect them overnight <,> to completely shed their predilections  
and preconceptions <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#63:1:A>
The individual tone of the mind <,> the colour of past experience  
<,,> the character and variety of interests <,,> the socio-economic  
background of the judge <,> inevitably play a role <,> in the decision making  
process <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#64:1:A>
Our great Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri frankly acknowledged <,,>  
that <quote> It is inevitable <,,> that the so called social philosophy and  
the scale of values of the judges <,> should play an important part <quote/>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#65:1:A>
At the same time he recognised <,> that <quote> The constitution is  
not meant only for the people <,> of their way of thinking <,> but for all  
</quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#66:1:A>
Now there have been occasions <,> no doubts <,,> when judges have  
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#67:1:A>
For example <,,> the judgement of Chief Justice S. R. Das <,,>  
declaring gambling as an immoral trade <,,> beyond the pale of constitutional  
protection <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#68:1:A>
Justice <w> Kapur's </w> view that certain advertisements for  
sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#69:1:A>
And Justice <w> Hidayatullah's </w> decision <,> I have never  
understood that <,> that <mention> Lady <w> Chatterley's </w> Lover  
</mention> was obscene <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#70:1:A>
All reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#71:1:A>
Strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the  
decisions of Justice Gajendragadkar <,,> in the field of industrial law <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#72:1:A>
Justice D. A. <w> Desa's </w> inveterate belief <,> that landlords  
were a rapacious lots <,,> and all tenants deserved the courts utmost  
solicitude was transparent in his judgements <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#73:1:A>
But <,,> it can be safely affirmed <,,> that in the overwhelming  
majority of cases <,,> judges in India <,,> have not acted as knight-errants  
<,,> on white chargers in quest of their individual notions of justice <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#74:1:A>
Cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous <,,>  
and the issues are legal and constitutional <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#75:1:A>
Judges as a rule <,> do not intentionally take a view against their  
conscience or their oath <,,> nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of  
the ruling party <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#76:1:A>
By and large <,> judges do make a conscientious effort to  
neutralise their personal beliefs <,> and predilections <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#77:1:A>
If a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged <,,> the  
court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the  
legislation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#78:1:A>
And it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion <,> the  
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#79:1:A>
Again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport  
<,,> is challenged <,,> in fact was challenged <,,> the individual notions of  
the Justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant <,,> in  
deciding whether there has been <,> breach of any constitutional provision  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#80:1:A>
The decision of the Supreme Court in the bank nationalisation case  
<,,> is frequently cited as an instance <,,> of the court striking down the  
legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#81:1:A>
I am afraid what is overlooked is <,,> in the criticism of this  
much <,> maligned judgement <,,> is that the Supreme Court rejected <,,> the  
basic and formidable argument <,,> that nationalisation of banks was not in  
the public interest <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#82:1:A>
They said it is not for the Supreme Court to go into that <,> they  
upheld that <,,> but <,,> court ruled that certain provisions of the Act <,>  
did not provide compensation as required under the then <,> constitutional  
provision <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#83:1:A>
Consequence was <,> that these provisions were amended <,,> and  
nationalisation of banks was effectuated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#84:1:A>
The general judicial attitude <,,> is aptly and correctly summed up  
<,,> in the classic statement of Justice Vivian Bose <,,> in a case of  
preventive detention of certain communists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#85:1:A>
Now mind you <,> he gave a dissenting judgement in which he <,>  
quashed the orders of detention of the communists <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#86:1:A>
But the statement which I want to read in which I <,> which I would  
like to read is this <,> and this was Justice Bose then <,,> <quote> It is  
perhaps ironical <,,> that I should struggle to oppose this freedoms in  
favour of a class of person <,,> who if rumour is to be accredited <,> and if  
the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide <,,> would be  
the first to destroy them if they but had the power <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#87:1:A>
But I cannot allow <,,> personal predilections <,,> to sway my  
judgement <,> of the Constitution </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#88:1:A>
Now let me come to another subject <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#89:1:A>
Is there any antithesis between democracy <,,> and an independent  
judiciary? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#90:1:A>
Is judicial review-on undemocratic? <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#91:1:A>
Does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people?  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#92:1:A>
Although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very  
often <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#93:1:A>
I think <w> it's </w> necessary <,,> to remove certain  
misconception <,,> about the role <,> of the judiciary in our constitutional  
scheme <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#94:1:A>
One of the essential features of our Constitution is division of  
power <,,> between different institutions namely the three wings of the State  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#95:1:A>
The Parliament and the State legislature <,,> the Executive and the  
Judiciary <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#96:1:A>
A central feature of our Constitution <,> flowing from the division  
of powers is <,> that of a limited government <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#97:1:A>
Consequently no authority or branch of the State can have absolute  
power <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#98:1:A>
Moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited  
power itself <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#99:1:A>
Since our Constitution divides power between different organs <,,>  
and prescribes limitations of the powers of Parliament the State legislature  
and the Executive <,,> it is imperative that there should be an impartial  
umpire <,,> in the shape of an independent judiciary <,,> to resolve the  
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power <,> which  
arise in the process of government <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#100:1:A>
And please remember <,,> that our Constitution has guaranteed  
certain fundamental rights <,,> and has expressly provided <,,> that any law  
or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-042#101:1:A>
The fundamental rights constitute a limitation <,,> on the powers  
of Parliament and the State legislatures and the executive <,> and the  
question whether any legislation <,,> or executive action is violative of any  
fundamental right <,,> has to be decided by some independent body <,,> </I>
