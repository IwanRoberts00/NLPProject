<ICE-IND:S2B-048#1:1:A>
Uh <,,> now <,,> before I go on <,> to <,,> the way <mention>  
Indian writing in English </mention> got a new <,> lease of life in the <,,>  
in the <,> in the seventees <,,> uh it <,,> it got a new lease of life <,> by  
being a part of <,> whatever you call <,> <mention> Commonwealth Literature  
</mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#2:1:A>
I mean <,,> I want to <,> talk about that a little later <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#3:1:A>
But before that <,,> I want to say <,> one or two things about <,,>  
present critical responses to <mention> Indian writing in English </mention>  
<,,> certain <,> trends and possibilities <,,> you see <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#4:1:A>
I read a paper on this <,> some time ago <,> and I thought uh <,>  
some of the things that I mentioned in the paper <,> are relevant to our <,>  
discussion in Indian writing in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#5:1:A>
Uhm <,> in this paper first I take three poles <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#6:1:A>
I mean I say that we can uh <,> uh <,,> arrange <,> a critical  
responses <,> according to the three poles that are in Indian writing in  
English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#7:1:A>
One is <,,> related to the term <mention> Indian </mention> <,> the  
other is related to the term <mention> English </mention> <,> and the third  
is related to the term <,,> <mention> writing </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#8:1:A>
So <,,> I say <w> let's </w> first concentrate our attention <,,> on  
the pole of English <,,> and survey the area of responses <,,> centred upon  
it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#9:1:A>
The early British responses are to be understood <,,> I think in the  
context of the <,> colonial situation <,> that existed at that time <,>  
characterised by the <,,> master-slave relationship <,,> tempered by the  
teacher-student relationship <,,> of <,> of uh liberal encouragement and  
patronage <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#10:1:A>
You all know <,,> about the concept of <,> <mention> The white <w>  
man's </w> burden </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#11:1:A>
The question is whether the British attitude <,> was really <,,>  
what David McCutchion thought it was <,,> that of patronising approval <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#12:1:A>
And with David McCutchion who talks about Indian writing in English  
and what the British thought of Indian writing in English <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#13:1:A>
<-> He he <,> his uh </-> <,> he saw <,> he thought <,> that uh <,>  
there is always a patronising approval <,> there is a patronising attitude  
<,,> uh <quote> We are astonished </quote> he says <,> <quote> not that it is  
done well <,> but that it is done at all </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#14:1:A>
Uh <w> I'm </w> sure David McCutchion <,,> judges <,,> his  
Victorian eh uh compatriots <,> like Edmund Gosse <,> then M A H A L Fisher  
<,> Arthur Symons Laurence Binyon <,> and young W B Yeats <,> rather  
ungenerously <,> attributing to them an attitude of superfluous <,>  
superiority <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#15:1:A>
These are these were the people <,> who talked about Indian writing  
in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#16:1:A>
Uh <,,> uh you know Edmund Gosse <,,> wrote about uh <,> uh Toru  
Dutt <,,> poetry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#17:1:A>
And he has referenced it to all these people who <,> uh uh liked  
Indian writing in English for <,,> one reason or another <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#18:1:A>
I do not think that Gosse was <,> patting on Toru <w> Dutt's </w>  
back <,,> out of uh <,,> adulterated kindness <,> born of <,> parental  
superiority <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#19:1:A>
If you look at what uh <,> Gosse wrote about Toru Dutt <,> he don't  
uh <,> find this uh <,> this kind of patting <,> it is genuine criticism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#20:1:A>
Now this is what Gosse wrote to Toru Dutt <,,> <quote> Literature  
has no honours <,,> which need have been <,> beyond the grasp of a girl <,>  
who at the age of twenty-one <,> and in language separated from her own <,>  
by so deep a chasm <,> had produced so much of lasting worth <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#21:1:A>
When the history of literature of our own country comes to be  
written <,> there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile <,>  
exotic <,> blossom of songs </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#22:1:A>
Of course I mean uh <,> he likes her for what she has written <,>  
and also with the word that term exotic is important <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#23:1:A>
That she has a place in the history of English literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#24:1:A>
And uh <,,> he also likes her because of uh <,> the the <,> the  
exoticism <,> that she brings in through her poetry <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#25:1:A>
This surely is not a patronising approval <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#26:1:A>
It is uh serious criticism expressed <,> with certain generosity  
<,> without falsifying the truth of his judgement <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#27:1:A>
Now <,> the second example that I give <,,> for such genuine kind  
of uh response <,,> uh without any offence of <}> <-> <.> pat </.> </-> <,>  
<=> patronage </=> </}> <,,> uh or <O> one word </O> is that of <,> <w>  
Yeats's </w> appreciation of <w> Tagore's </w> <mention> Gitanjali </mention>  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#28:1:A>
If you read <,,> uh I refer to this yesterday if you read <,> uh  
<w> Yeats's </w> uh <,> uh preface to <w> Tagore's </w> <mention> Gitanjali  
</mention> <,,> we find that <,,> uh this appreciation <,,> uh of Tagore his  
appreciation of Tagore <,> throbs with a <,> singular <,,> sincerity of  
response <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#29:1:A>
I quote <,,> <quote> The work of <,> a supreme culture <,,> they  
yet appear <}> <-> as <.> mu </.> </-> <=> as much </=> </}> the growth of  
the common soil <,> as the grass and the rushes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#30:1:A>
A whole people <,,> a whole civilization <,,> immeasurably strange  
to us </quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#31:1:A>
Once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us <,>  
<quote> seems to have been taken up <,> into this <,> imagination <,,> and  
yet <,> we were moved <,> because of the strangeness <,> but because we have  
<,> met our own image <,> as though we had walked in <w> Rossetti's </w>  
<mention> Willow wood </mention> <,> or heard <,> perhaps for the first time  
in literature <,> our voice <,,> as in a dream </quote> <,,> unquote <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#32:1:A>
What we had to accept is <,,> the sincerity <,> and genuineness of  
critical response <,> in tune with the literary tradition <,> to which the  
critics belonged <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#33:1:A>
I don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise <,> in for  
example <,> Graham <w> Green's </w> comparison of uh <,,> uh <,,> R K Narayan  
<,> with <,> Chekov <,,> or Herbert <w> Read's </w> faith in Shankar Mokashi  
<w> Punekar's </w> poetry <,,> or Milton <w> Brown's </w> comparison <,> of  
the chronicles of Kedaram <,> with Main Street and Cranford <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#34:1:A>
The tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of Indian works <,,> in  
English by western critics <,,> they include the Australian critics as well  
<,,> is a continous phenomenon <,> which has to be accounted for I think <,,>  
phase-wise <,> taking into consideration <,> the changing context of Indian  
writing in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#35:1:A>
The early phase was coloured <,> by a certain self confessed <,>  
generosity <,,> I mean we should agree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#36:1:A>
Even though it is genuine <,> there is a certain amount of <,> self  
conscious generosity <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#37:1:A>
And uh <,> there was no question of misreading <,> our Indian  
Indo-English literature <,> since it was well within the traditions of  
English poetry <,,> with which they were familiar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#38:1:A>
The so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell  
<,,> but it was never blinding or binding <,> so as to distort <,> their  
critical sense <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#39:1:A>
After Independence <,> <mention> Indian writing in English  
</mention> achieved its identity <,> as a viable body of literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#40:1:A>
The responses of people like Graham Greene <,> William Walsh <,> E  
M Foster <,> and Laurence Durrel <,,> were <,> seized by us with avidity <,,>  
since they helped us in building up <,> our confidence <,> in the valley of  
our literature <,,> soon 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#41:1:A>
Thanks to the rise of uh <mention> Commonwealth literature  
</mention> <,,> in answer to the new political and cultural needs of <,> the  
erstwhile colonies of England <,> <mention> Indian writing in English  
</mention> claimed a place <,,> legitimate and illegitimate at the same time  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#42:1:A>
Legitimate because of the medium <,> and illegitimate from the  
point of view of the centrality of Indian experience <,,> uh obtained the  
place in it <,> and it was subjected to scholarly study <,> of western and  
Australian <,> Commonwealth literature experts <,> like Riemenschneider <,>  
Keith uh <,> uh Carelein <,> Syd Harrex <,> Haydn Moore Williams <,> Dorothy  
Spencer <,> Kai Nicholson etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#43:1:A>
This post nineteen sixty criticism <,> is characterised by a good  
deal of misreading <,,> although it was based on well meaning laborous close  
reading <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#44:1:A>
They misreading <,> being the result of a lack of cultural  
inwardness <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#45:1:A>
These critics <,> trained in uh <,,> in the tradition of New  
Criticism <,,> discover in our novelist <,,> patterns and layers of meaning  
not easily visible <,> to a <}> <-> norman </-> <=> normal </=> </}> Indian  
reader <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#46:1:A>
Now <,> I make this uh <,> uhm <}> <-> <.> po </.> </-> <=> point  
</=> </}> with a reference to William Walsh <,> what he wrote about R K  
Narayan <,,> and also what uh <,,> uh <,,> some Australian critic wrote about  
<,> Jejuri <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#47:1:A>
So Jejuri I mentioned yesterday <,> today <w> I'm </w> going to say  
something that William <w> Walsh's </w> response to R K <w> Narayan's </w>  
fiction <,,> and uh <,> particularly you should <}> <-> <.> r </.> </-> <=>  
read </=> </}> in his book <mention> Commonwealth Literature </mention> <,>  
his uh response to R K <w> Narayan's </w> <mention> Guide </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#48:1:A>
His response is sincere and subtle <,> no doubt but the question is  
<,> do the novels of uh <,> R K Narayan really stand this over subtle <,> and  
over enthusiastic scrutiny <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#49:1:A>
But then <,> what is historically important is the <,> western <w>  
critic's </w> joy <,> of discovery <,> which always colours their perceptions  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#50:1:A>
In the case of <w> Narayan's </w> or <w> Anand's </w> fiction the  
western reader finds <,,> an easy entry through ironic or realistic modes <,>  
employed in it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#51:1:A>
But it is <,> when they encounter Raja Rao <,> that they are  
baffled <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#52:1:A>
David McCutchion for instance <,> confesses frankly <,> <quote> the  
Anglo-Saxon mind does not understand India very well </quote> <,,> he says  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#53:1:A>
With Aurobindo too <,> they experience <,> an opacity of response  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#54:1:A>
Walsh for instance finds Aurobindo <,> <quote> evasive <,,>  
constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind </quote> <,> and  
dismisses him by saying <,> <quote> the importance of Aurobindo <,> Ghosh  
belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion <,> than literature  
</quote> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#55:1:A>
The Western critical sensibility <,> loves irony <,> realism  
concreteness <,,> conflict and rigidity of form <,> and it gets baffled and  
frustrated <,> when it faces something <,> abstract <,,> apparently formless  
<,> spiritual <,> and mystical <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#56:1:A>
In the dialectics of critical process <,> or to use <w> Leacis's  
</w> phrase <,> in the collaborative effort of literary criticism <,> this  
honest bafflement has a significant role to play <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#57:1:A>
It leads <,> to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical  
assumptions <,> and to certain important clarifications <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#58:1:A>
The bafflement of the western readers with regard to Raja <w> Rao's  
</w> fiction for instance <,> particularly <,> <mention> Serpent and the Rope  
</mention> <,> and uh <O> one word </O> and Shakespear <,> uh for instance  
inspired Professor Narasimaih <,> and Dr <}> <-> <.> Na </.> </-> <=> M K  
Naik </=> </}> <,> uh Narasimiah and Dr M K <w> Naik's </w> excellent  
analyses of uh <,> Raja <w> Rao's </w> works <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#59:1:A>
What is important is the livingness of the critical process <,>  
which ultimately cannot be <}> <-> <.> dis </.> </-> <,> <=> dissociated </=>  
</}> <,> from the process of culture <,> or life in general <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#60:1:A>
Thanks to the fact that <mention> Indian writing in English  
</mention> is <,> easily accessible <,> to the western English speaking and  
English knowing world <,,> because of the medium <,> the western response has  
grown into a tradition <,> to such an extent that the western and Australian  
critics can carry on their dialogue <,> on <mention> Indian writing in  
English </mention> without reference to Indian critics at all <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#61:1:A>
No other Indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside  
world <,> which therefore tends to equate <,,> Indian writing in English with  
Indian literature <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#62:1:A>
This has created <,> an anomalous situation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#63:1:A>
In Commonwealth studies <,,> literary conferences and festivals <,>  
it is this <mention> Indian writing in English </mention> <,> that gets <,,>  
national representation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#64:1:A>
What is of relevance to the <,> uh question we are discussing in  
this seminar <,> is the fact that the western response is a positive factor  
<,> in the development of Indo-English literature and criticism <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#65:1:A>
With its enthusiasm its over estimation <,> with its quest for  
Indianness <,> for Indian philosophical and esoteric speculations <,> for  
Indian sociological pecularities <,> with its bafflements and limitations <,>  
with its habits of close reading in search of <,> deeper layers of meaning  
<,> the western response <,> adds a new dimension to our <,> own critical  
awareness <,> which it keeps alive and kicking all the time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#66:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> now move <,,> uh <,> uh to the pole <,> represented  
in term <,,> in the term <mention> Indian </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#67:1:A>
This uh <,,> of great <}> <-> <.> signi </.> </-> <=> significance  
</=> </}> in the context of <,> the critical climate that we have been  
talking about <,,> because it is the <,,> it is the uh <,> centripetal  
movement <,,> towards the roots <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#68:1:A>
As far as Indian writing in English is concerned <,> the first <,>  
uh big uh movement is to be discovered <,> in Sri <w> Aurobindo's </w>  
criticism of his own <,> poems <,> and his critical remarks on fellow poetic  
poets like Tagore <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#69:1:A>
Then I have uh talked about Aurobindo <,> and how I mean during the  
pre-independence period <,> uh he was uh <,> <-> a a a </-> <,> an Indian  
critic very conscious of his Indianess <,,> and uh <,> he knew his western  
<,,> poet and western critics <,> uh but still he has uh <,> great faith in  
the kind of uh <,> new <,> uh poetry that he was writing <,> in epics like uh  
<,,> <mention> Savitri </mention> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#70:1:A>
Uh <,> yesterday I talked about uh this and so I don't want to  
repeat this <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#71:1:A>
The attainment of independence <,,> was followed by a certain <,>  
uneasiness towards English <,,> and Indo <}> <-> <.> Eng </.> </-> <=>  
Anglian </=> </}> literature <,> as it was then called <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#72:1:A>
Uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards English still  
continues <,> though Indo-English literature gained <,> gradual acceptance  
during the late <,,> fiftees and the sixtees <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#73:1:A>
The rise of the Commonwealth <,,> the concept of other literatures  
in English <,,> uh the multiplication of uh <,> universities and university  
departments of English <,> are some of the factor that changed the climate  
for the development of Indian writing in English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#74:1:A>
Yesterday also I <,> I referred to <,,> the the <,> uh the  
multiplication of university departments of English <,,> because of which <,>  
I mean the <mention> Indian writing in English </mention> <,> uh got a  
special place <,> uh as far as research is concerned <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#75:1:A>
The growth of the thesis industry demanded <,,> complete  
exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#76:1:A>
The increase in the U G C and university supported seminars <,,>  
this is one of them <,> uh conferences <,,> journals created a suitable  
climate for intense critical activity <,> in the area of Indian writing in  
English <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#77:1:A>
The pioneering work of Professor K R Narsimh uh K R <,> Srinivas  
Iyengar <,,> uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and  
research <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-048#78:1:A>
First the problem of English as a creative medium <,> was thrashed  
out after tremendous <,> warfare of passions <,> and the value of  
Indo-English literature <,> in the new national context of emergent Indian  
literatures <,> in <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> regional </=> </}> <,>  
languages was questioned <,> and after a good deal of uh discussion <,> it  
has been accepted <,> to use Professor <w> Narasimaih's </w> words <,>  
<quote> not in a <,> not as an exotic plant <,> but as an expression of a  
distinctive sensibility <,> which is Indian </quote> <,,> </I>
