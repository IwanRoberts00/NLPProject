CONTEMPORARY black drama has emerged not only as a source of
entertainment but also as an expression of culture and a medium of
instruction.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#5:1>
The new black dramatists in America have artistically depicted the
identity crisis faced by the black Americans in their plays.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#6:1>
Today there is a widespread recognition by black American dramatists
that theatre can have enormous impact on the black <w> man's </w> struggle to
attain full equality and status in America and thereby regain his spiritual
strength.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#7:1>
So the performing arts have emerged as important means of reaching
wider audiences and getting greater recognition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#8:1>
A number of dramatists have made very significant contribution,
towards the growth of black theatre in America and the success of their
effort is seen in the establishment of Black Protest Theatre there. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#9:1>
The black protest theatre movement in America arises out of a
certain social and political philosophy of life.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#10:1>
Black dramatists like Baraka and Bullins firmly believe that <quote>
" there are in fact and in spirit two Americas - - one black, one white"
</quote> <sp> <fnr> 1 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#11:1>
These dramatists have lost faith in the concept of <quote> ` American
Dream' </quote> and the integrationist principles advocated by the middle
class American blacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#12:1>
Consequently these playwrights reject the Western dramatic theories
with their emphasis on social realism and the universality of human
experiences which have no validity in the context of black situation
prevailing in America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#13:1>
These dramatists are of the view that long years of <O> <&> page </&>
47 </O> suffering and oppression of the blacks have necessitated the adoption
of a new dramatic model that will address the black brethren directly leading
to the expression of their unique black experience in America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#14:1>
Quite naturally, besides advocating racial and cultural
separation, these plays are addressed to the black people who have a social
and cultural tradition different from the mainstream American Society and
whose experiences run counter to the Western modes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#15:1>
Baraka in his essay <quote> ` The Revolutionary Theatre' </quote>
, has laid down the aims and objectives of this new kind of theatre which has
ushered in a new theatrical renaissance in America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#16:1>
He says that this new theatre will bring in a new vision of black
reality by its open advocacy of violence and revolution which will lead to
the destruction of white America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#17:1>
This theatre will present <quote> " the black as a victim living in a
no-<w> man's </w> land completely invisible to white America." </quote> <sp>
<fnr> 2 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#18:1>
By presenting this theatre as a theatre of victims, it excites the
black spectators to anger and violence which moves them into liberation of
blacks from a sense of suffering and oppression in white America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#19:1>
This theatre, by its advocacy of violence, murder and revolution
seeks to put an end to the suffering of blacks in America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#20:1>
The violence it preaches is redemptive of a regenerative kind of
violence that envisages the establishment of a new world order based on
revolution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#21:1>
Baraka, in his early plays presents his heroes as victims since they
refuse to act very firmly in time which makes them a prey to white power
structure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#22:1>
But his later dramatic heroes emerge triumphant physically and
spiritually having acquired the revolutionary black consciousness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#23:1>
The process of <quote> ` razing' </quote> gives rise to <quote> `
raising' </quote> a new black world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#24:1>
<quote> " The Revolutionary Theatre must expose.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#25:1>
It must Accuse and attack anything that can be accused or attacked.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#26:1>
It must Accuse and Attack because it is a theatre of victims."
</quote> <sp> <fnr> 3 </fnr> </sp> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#27:1>
The black dramatists like Baraka and Bullins are of the view that
their picture of black coloured realism depicting the sufferings of the
blacks is much different from the Euro-American concept of realism as
portrayed by the mainstream writers who <O> <&> page </&> 48 </O> take no
cognisance of the black situation prevailing in America.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#28:1>
This revolutionary black realism not only aims at destruction of
social and cultural white America but also builds a new black world by
incorporating the Afro-American cultural values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#29:1>
The black revolutionary writers like Baraka during the course of
their dramatic career are very much influenced by the theories of black
Aesthetics and Black Art, The advocates of this theory say that Black is
beautiful and produce literary works depicting black life with its
distinctive styles and rhythms of black people.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#30:1>
They try to go back to their black heritage and strength which have
enabled them to endure prolonged oppression.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#31:1>
Some black revolutionary writers like Baraka want the black writer to
create black art by separating himself completely from the American
mainstream and give expression to black experience.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#32:1>
The black Art which will directly address the black people will give
them a new sense of direction, a new mythology and symbolism which would help
in the shaping of the black artistic and cultural forms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#33:1>
Any work of art if it does not adequately reflect the black
experience, does not confirm to the theories of Black Aesthetics.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#34:1>
The pragmatic value of a work of art, its effective quality is more
important than its expressive qualities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#35:1>
According to the principles of black Aesthetic, the transmission of a
message from a teaching black author to willing black audience becomes the
<}> <-> touchstonce </-> <+> touchstone </+> </}> of literary achievement.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#36:1>
According to the revolutionary protest writers, black drama or any
work of art arising from the oppression and sufferings of the black people
should change the structure of the American society and end the oppression of
the blacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#37:1>
Besides this, black community and thereby usher in a cultural
revolution. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#38:1>
The black critics have come out with certain new artistic
criteria in evaluating these black productions.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#39:1>
These critics want these black productions to be judged not on the
basis of western dramatic theories and practice, but on their own black
cultural <}> <-> ejchoes </-> <+> echoes </+> </}> and tradition.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#40:1>
Since these plays are written out of the suffering and oppression of
blacks, they have to be judged based on Afro-American cultural tradition and
yardstick.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#41:1>
While evaluating a black performance, the critic has to take into his
consideration the subject matter of the play and its impact on the audience
since the black dramatists interested <O> <&> page </&> 49 </O> in educating
the black community and thereby raise its consciousness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#42:1>
Under such conditions a black play is not just a work of art but
becomes an effective tool in raising the black awareness of the entire race.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#43:1>
Therefore it would be better if the critic evaluates these plays with
a knowledge of Afro-American Culture and history.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#44:1>
By way of illustration, we can cite the example of Kathakali theatre
in Kerala.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#45:1>
A performance of Kathakali dance would make a better impact on an
indigenous audience with the significance of gesture, sounds, words and their
connotations.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#46:1>
While the Indian audience can share the reaction to the play it is
lost on a non-Indian audience.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#47:1>
Addison Gayle provides a proper evaluation of black production. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#48:1>
<quote> " A critical methodology has no relevance in the black
community unless it aids men in becoming better than they are.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#49:1>
Such an element has been solely lacking in the critical cannons
handed down from the academics by the Aristotlean critics, the Practical
critics, the Formalistic critics, and the New critics.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#50:1>
Each has this in common : it aims to evaluate the work of art in
terms of its beauty, and not in terms of the transformation from ugliness to
beauty, that the work of art demands from its audience.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#51:1>
The question for the black critic today is not how beautiful is a
melody, a play, a poem, or a novel, but how much more beautiful has the poem
melody, play or novel made the life of a single black man.<+>"</+> </quote>
<sp> <fnr> 4 </fnr> </sp> <&> second margin end </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#52:1>
This Black Protest Theatre makes no distinction between actors
and audience or stage and the street or the plays illusion and <w>
audience's </w> reality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#53:1>
Such distinctions which form part of the Western theatre do not hold
good in revolutionary black theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#54:1>
One another important characteristic of Black Protest Theatre that is
distinct from the mainstream theatre is its ritualistic aspect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#55:1>
The ritualistic elements refer to the presence of symbols,
characterisation, themes, and language styles which are frequently repeated
in all the plays.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#56:1>
This brings to the <}> <-> andience </-> <+> audience </+> </}>
certain identifiable patterns which affirm the values of the black community
for whom these plays are written. <O> <&> page </&> 50 </O>

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#57:1>
Baraka employs all these devices to produce a ritualistic effect in
his Revolutionary Theatre.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#58:1>
At the apparent level <it> <mention> Great Goodness of Life
</mention> </it> is an allegory.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#59:1>
It is the story of a weak man who kills his son rather than resist
the pressures of an oppressive white power.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#60:1>
The deeper meaning of the play is that a middle class black is unable
to protect the life of his son because of fear of the whites.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#61:1>
He prefers the killing of his son to resisting the white power. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#62:1>
Baraka has employed symbols in his revolutionary dramas which
bring out the meaning of the play in very clear terms.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#63:1>
The white woman in his plays represents evil who taunts the black
male with her perverse sexuality.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#64:1>
Lula in <it> <mention> Dutchman </mention> </it> represents the
white female temptress and she is the symbol of the white middle class
America who tempts Clay into violent action. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#65:1>
Baraka by the use of his language has ritualised his plays.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#66:1>
He has accepted a particular style of language with regard to white
and black characters.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#67:1>
The black hero is a <quote> ` hip' </quote> whose language reveals
his heightened black awareness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#68:1>
His language emanates from the street world of pimps and prostitutes.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#69:1>
The <quote> ` square' </quote> is a despised character who employs a
different language register, who is considered to be dangerous to the black
world. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#70:1>
In the later black revolutionary plays, Baraka incorporates the
ritual form with black symbols and images to give expression to his
revolutionary consciousness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#71:1>
A <it> <mention> Black Mass </mention> </it> is a typical black play
which utilises Afro-American mythic structure incorporating the music of
Sun Ra and the ideology of the Nation of Islam.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#72:1>
Baraka, in his effort to bring out his revolutionary black
consciousness repeats these devices from play to play so that these patterns
are easily recognised by the black audience. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#73:1>
The idea of an autonomous dramatic form conceived in the Western
tradition gives place to a theatre that demands audience involvement and
participation to achieve its aims and objectives.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#74:1>
This process is described <quote> " as a movement from mimesis,
representation of an action, to methexis, communal helping out of action."
</quote> <sp> <fnr> 5 </fnr> </sp>

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#75:1>
Through this process, the black <O> <&> page </&> 51 </O> audience is
transformed from spectators of drama to participators of ritual with no
distinction between actor and spectator. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#76:1>
Another important feature of Black Protest theatre by which it
distinguishes itself from the mainstream theatre is in its use of music and
dance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#77:1>
The black dramatists, by incorporating the elements of black music
and dance, in their plays, give expression to their unique black experience.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#78:1>
This theatre, by stressing the close relationship that exists between
black artist and the black spectator, gives way to improvisational action
leading to emotional participation.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#79:1>
Under such theatrical condition, the traditional distinction
between the spectator and the actor is blurred when they become one. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#80:1>
This black theatre bears a close resemblance to Antonin <w>
Artaud's </w> Theatre of Cruelty.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#81:1>
According to Artaud human beings are governed by certain
incomprehensible malignant cosmic powers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#82:1>
The universe with its violent irrational forces is cruel.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#83:1>
The theatre should reveal the essence of human nature by <quote> ` a
drama of cruelty' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#84:1>
Such scenes must be presented to purge the audience of the
corresponding emotions in them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#85:1>
So, a <quote> ` true theatre' </quote> disturbs repose, frees the
repressed unconscious, incites a kind of revolt and exteriorises latent
cruelty, certainly most of <w> Baraka's </w> plays disturb repose and uncover
source of conflict.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#86:1>
On one occasion the performance of <it> <mention> Dutchman </mention>
</it> was cancelled on the ground that it would incite the feelings of black
audience shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#87:1>
We can also compare the dramatic theories of this black theatre
with those of the epic theatre advocated by Bertolt Brecht.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#88:1>
According to Brecht the highest form of theatre induces the audience
to act and also demands decisions from them.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#89:1>
Brecht also emphasises the apartnesses of the theatrical activity
wherein the spectator is transformed into an observer.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#90:1>
He is of the view that too much emotional involvement of the audience
with the performance has dried them of the creative energies needed to bring
about the desired changes in the world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#91:1>
Brecht says that the spectators should leave the theatre with tools
of heightened scientific perception.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#92:1>
However, black revolutionary dramatists are different in that they
aim at complete emotional involvement on the part of the audience with the
actors, a fact proved by his agit - - prop plays which carry <O> <&> page
</&> 52 </O> the message to the black community in a simple but effective
way. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#93:1>
The Western drama since Aristotle by following the
conventional dramatic devices has always attempted to uphold the existing
social and cultural values of the society.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#94:1>
But Black Protest Theatre not only questions the traditional validity
of the social and cultural values of the Western Society but also rejects
them completely with the purpose of inculcating new values.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#95:1>
Consequently this Black Protest Theatre makes the audience realise
the sad aspect of their lives and forces them into continuing group action.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-009#96:1>
The Black Protest Theatre goes beyond pointing out injustices
meted out to the black community or making meek appeals to the white society
to put an end to its oppression of the Blacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-009#97:1>
This theatre that aims at liberating the entire black race, becomes a
theatre of communal deliverance, which aims at freeing the black race from
the shackles of the white power structure and build a new black world founded
on justice, dignity and pride. </p> <&> on page 46 </&>
