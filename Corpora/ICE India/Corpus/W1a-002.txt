<h> <bold> <}> <-> Impacts </-> <+> Impact </+> </}> Of Science On
Human Life. </h> </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#2:1>
Firstly before the <}> <-> impacts </-> <+> impact </+> </}> we
understand the meaning of science and emergence in our human life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#3:1>
Science means <mention> the systematic study of a </mention>
knowledge or a subject.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#4:1>
The basic concept in scientific thinking are as follows: </p>
<marginalia> A) </marginalia> Science and Reason - -

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#5:1>
The middle age has witnessed the tremendous progress of science
and it has been truely called as the age of Science.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#6:1>
From the 15th century the progress of science has been phenomenal.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#7:1>
The growing wealth of western nations provided ample <}> <->
oppertunity </-> <+> opportunity </+> </}> and scope for scientific progress.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#8:1>
The patronage in science resulted not only in the discovery of
scientific truth, but also in the building up of a new and refreshing
outlook. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#9:1>
The progress of science gave rise to a scientific outlook to
life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#10:1>
Blind faith has been completely replaced by rational conviction in
the middle age.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#11:1>
No one is ready or willing to accept a thought or theory, which is
not based on substantial reasons or which in its support does not cite enough
proof or evidence.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#12:1>
This has in turn not only influenced life considerably but has also
increased the output of scientific discovery and the pace of its progress.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#13:1>
The progress of science has also acted to discipline man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#14:1>
Many old principles of science have been replaced by new ones as a
result of further investigation, observation and experiment.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#15:1>
This has been compelled man not to be too dogmatic in his assertions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#16:1>
He has to recognise the probablity of newer data other proofs more
<}> <-> conveining </-> <+> convincing </+> </}> , another point of view,
more forceful which could effectively <+> ( </+> after the conclusions he has
arrived at, or may even disprove <+> it </+> <+> ) </+> <-> which he </->
upholds.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#17:1>
The scientist and the common man should, therefore not only be too
dogmatic and over - - <}> <-> Jubulant </-> <+> jubilant </+> </}> about
their achievements, but they should keep an open mind so as to revive the
truth from whenever, it may emerge.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#18:1>
This receptivity of the mind is a great boon, as is keeps man alert
and active. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#19:1>
<h> Scientific Observation and Experimentation. </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#20:1>
The classical methods of arriving at scientific truth were
rediscovered <}> <-> by </-> <+> in </+> </}> Europe, <}> <-> begining </->
<+> beginning </+> </}> the Age of Renaissance Original thinking was one of
the most important cause of ( Renaissance) science.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#21:1>
The church had set its own pattern of thinking in the medieval period
based on blind faith and dogmas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#22:1>
The Church penalised those thinkers, who went against the principles
and attitude approved by the Church.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#23:1>
It was difficult to challenge the Church and her custodians and
independent thinkers were likely to ruin their career or even <}> <-> loose
</-> <+> lose </+> </}> their lives.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#24:1>
But gradually thinkers came out boldly with their ideas, and it was
then that free thinking became possible.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#25:1>
Among them Roger Bacon laid the foundation of modern science by his
insistence on the experimental method in science.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#26:1>
He believed that scientific truth can be ascertained and rightly
affirmed only by observing its nature or knowing it by actual
experimentation.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#27:1>
It was not correct to take anything for granted simply because it had
been proclaimed by another scholar.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#28:1>
Also the scientists like William Harvey his theory of the circulation
of <}> <-> Blood, </-> <+> blood </+> </}> <w> Galileo's </w> new approach to
the study of the universe and Sir Issac <w> Newton's </w> discovery of the
Laws of Gravitation detailed out in his <foreign> <quote> ` Principia
Mathematica' </quote> </foreign> were pioneering achievements in the age of
Science, which excited the imagination of marry a young man and the
patronage afforded to research as a result of the wealth built up on
account of the expansion of European commercial activity and later due to the
mechanisation of industry made possible tremendous progress of science.
</p> <marginalia> B) </marginalia> <h> Spirit of Enquiry ( Why and How of
things) </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#29:1>
In a broad sense, Renaissance means much more than rebirth or
revival of interest in <}> <-> leaving </-> <+> learning </+> </}> and art.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#30:1>
It stands for an <}> <-> all-around </-> <+> all round </+> </}>
development and is widening of the human mind & horizon.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#31:1>
During the middle ages the human mind had been under the control of
the Church, but with release of the human mind <}> <-> Original Thinking </->
<+> original thinking </+> </}> and experimentations were possible.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#32:1>
There was a time in Europe <}> <-> were </-> <+> where it was </+>
</}> possible, all the things <}> <-> hold </-> <+> held </+> </}> out by
Church had to be accepted as the <}> <-> gospec </-> <+> gospel </+> </}> <->
of </-> truth.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#33:1>
But the Renaissance created the spirit of enquiry.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#34:1>
It was now possible to ask questions, How ? and why ?

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#35:1>
And so it was caused to a scientific investigations observations.
etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#36:1>
And thus Renaissance stood for a new enterprising and active
spirit, which penetrated all fields of human thought and activity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#37:1>
Renaissance, thinkers, scholars, explorers <del> rx </del> and
artists <}> <-> injured </-> <+> infused </+> </}> a new spirit, which
brought about a great transition from the medieval world of blind faith,
dogmas, and confirmity to the modern world of free thought and expression
rationalism and scientific experimentation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#38:1>
And now we discuss below the <}> <-> impacts </-> <+> impact </+>
</}> of science <+> on human life </+> which <}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+>
</}> great or boon as well as bad or damage for human life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#39:1>
Science has made a development in all parts of a human life, e.g.
in Medicine, Space Research, Industry, Agriculture, Fishery, Construction,
Music, Art, etc. and etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#40:1>
Because of Alexander <w> Fleming's </w> new discovered substance
which is called <quote> ` Antibiotic' </quote> Penicillin, we can destroy a
bacterial <-> disease </-> by using it.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#41:1>
It also affected on human life by the invention of Entertainment
device called as Television <+> which </+> was invented by John Logie Baird,
a Scotsman, in 1922.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#42:1>
Because of T.V. <}> <-> We </-> <+> we </+> </}> can watch all the
events, past events, sports, Orchestra which is happening anywhere in the
world, in our <}> <-> room lively. </-> <+> living room. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#43:1>
It greatly affected on social life of human <}> <-> being. </-> <+>
beings. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#44:1>
It is useful for educative, scientific, entertainment <-> , </->
purpose and for the knowledge gaining things specially for rural, <}> <->
ignore </-> <+> ignorant </+> </}> people of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#45:1>
Because of space research human <+> beings </+> can <-> able to </->
touch and stand on the moon, and also trying to get more and more about other
planets, galaxies etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#46:1>
Science has made great revolutionary things in Agricultural &
Industrial sectors.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#47:1>
A new seed named <quote> ` Hybrid' </quote> has proved to be very
successful in the case of maize which mainly is a cattle feed in USA, <-> .
</-> also some new discovered <}> <-> indian </-> <+> Indian </+> </}> wheat
seeds like <indig> Bansi, Kalyan Sona, Vijay </indig> etc. are very famous
for their superiority.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#48:1>
Computers made a great revolution in all the sectors of human life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#49:1>
Computer is used for educational, scientific, business, musical,
artistic and in constructional sectors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#50:1>
With the great effects science has also many bad effects but they
are also <+> able to </+> change into good effects if we use them for a <}>
<-> peaful </-> <+> peaceful </+> </}> life, happy life in the world etc.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#51:1>
In the second world war America used a Hydrogen bomb and <}> <->
throwned </-> <+> threw </+> </}> it on the big cities of Japan namely
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, due to this Japan has <}> <-> greately </-> <+>
greatly </+> </}> damaged and still <-> afford that bombs </-> pains in their
<}> <-> mind. </-> <+> minds. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#52:1>
The recent example is of France which has tested their nuclear bombs
in Pacific Ocean, due to this the cold war emerged between big and developed
countries, which affected the world life.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#53:1>
America has made its development by substantial use of science.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#54:1>
So she is a powerful and highly developed country in the world, and
doing what she will like, for e.g. a recent news that President <w> Clinton's
</w> <}> <-> govts has </-> <+> govt is </+> </}> ready to supply nuclear &
defensive weapons <}> <-> supply </-> <+> supplied </+> </}> to <}> <->
pakistan. </-> <+> Pakistan. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#55:1>
It is dangerous to South Asian countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#56:1>
So if we use the advantages of sciences properly and made all the
things of the world for <}> <-> happy </-> <+> happiness </+> </}> & peaceful
<+> purposes </+> then our earth will remain in future.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#57:1>
Our next generation can live a happy and prosperous life without any
fear in their mind.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#58:1>
Because God has made this earth, life for living & maintain our earth
& planets <}> <-> . Then </-> <+> then </+> </}> it will <}> <-> truth </->
<+> true </+> </}> that human being is really a developed & <}> <-> happieous

<h> ARE WE PROGRESSING <*> dotted line </*> ? </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#60:2>
The title itself asks <del> ? </del> us the question whether we
are happy & contented with our progress or is there some sort of repentness
hidden in our happiness. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#61:2>
Well, as we know <}> <-> that </-> <+> the </+> </}> primitive
man worked with his hands, so we called it to be <quote> ` Age of
Hands'</quote>, then he progressed he tamed animals so he ushered in the
<quote> ` Age of Animals' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#62:2>
The progress followed him, it touched <w> man's </w> feet so there
came the <quote> ` Age of Steam' </quote> , <quote> ` Age of Electricity'
</quote> , <quote> ` Age of Bombs' </quote> & so on ...

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#63:2>
Thus <-> ; </-> man being considered as the most intelligent creature
living on the surface <+> of the earth </+> started progressing.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#64:2>
Man & progress walked hand in hand.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#65:2>
He was very happy and <del> prod <del> proud to be called <quote> `
Man - - <}> <-> The </-> <+> the </+> </}> most creative & intelligent one'
</quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#66:2>
Now he started thinking & progressing to meet new <}> <-> adventurous

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#67:2>
As we know <-> that </-> , primitive man <}> <-> were </-> <+>

They dwelt in peace.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#69:2>
They breathed fresh air which was pure.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#70:2>
They ate plain but healthy food, they drank pure milk.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#71:2>
They had plenty of <del> execri </del> exercise in great open spaces.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#72:2>
Their lives were quite natural.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#73:2>
They were so carefree children of good earth.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#74:2>
They had ample of leisure to observe & enjoy & feel the wonder of
nature.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#75:2>
They had eyes for sunrise & sunset; they had warm hearts & contented
minds, <quote> ` true happiness lies in sweet content' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#76:2>
Though the<del>y</del> resources were scant, but so were their needs
& wants.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#77:2>
In short, the past age was truly happy.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#78:2>
But the greed <}> <-> to </-> <+> for </+> </}> progress part man
from nature mother. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#79:2>
First progress came to man, man walked hand in hand with progress
but now, progress has dragged man far away from nature & beauty.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#80:2>
He made excellent discoveries & inventions; his curiosity <del> had
</del> has no limits for comfort.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#81:2>
This greed <}> <-> of </-> <+> for </+> </}> progress tore him apart

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#82:2>
Now in present era, we find machines ruling over <+> man. </+>

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#83:2>
Man made machine, & most of the work is done by them; machines do
save lot of time, <w> what's </w> the use, <del> it </del> in exchange it is
readily consuming man to man relationship, causing no <del> human feele
</del> humanitarian feeling for one another.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#84:2>
Man is betraying each other.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#85:2>
We have <}> <-> turn </-> <+> turned </+> </}> blind towards
exercising what is good & beautiful.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#86:2>
<w> That's </w> why living under a wrong impression made us <del>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#87:2>
Progress meant a blessing but man misused & <}> <-> turn </-> <+>
turned </+> </}> it to be a curse on human race.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#88:2>
Our souls have not kept pace with our progress we still are <del> ore
</del> busy creating nuclear weapons to destroy the very own man-hood.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#89:2>
We are living in shadows of great danger, <del> though </del> and
still what we defined it as the mere name <quote> " Progress" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#90:2>
This progress has followed materialistic lines at the cost of our
spiritual value.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#91:2>
Our selfishness & greed & lust for power considering as progress
have assisted monstrous weapons & modern warfare. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#92:2>
Progress has enslaved man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#93:2>
Progress meant for betterment of <}> <-> livelyhood </-> <+>
livelihood </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#94:2>
Scientific progress <del> was </del> is misused creating nuclear
bombs & not for betterment but to <del> dins </del> extinguish the lovely &
beautiful <w> God's </w> creativity.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#95:2>
There are large enough stock-pile of atomic bombs today which are
thirsting to destroy whole world.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#96:2>
This nuclear war can wipe off the existence of life from the globe.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#97:2>
Such is the present prospect <del> of </del> today.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#98:2>
<w> Man's </w> heart has moved with his head; Hunger for progress has
made him possess a stone-hard heart with no basic human emotions.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#99:2>
Progress has left our soul far behind. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#100:2>
The <quote> ` ape' </quote> in man has got the better of his
<quote> ` essence' </quote> & so man is misusing the blessings & turning into
curse.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#101:2>
The wonders in progress are employed to satisfy the beast in man.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#102:2>
Progress in any field be <+> it </+> science, machinery, knowledge
contributes the feeling of victory & artifical happiness but this <}> <->
artificalness </-> <+> artificialness </+> </}> <del> has </del> is of
temporary satisfaction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-002#103:2>
As we are progressing, we are wiping the foot-prints of truth,
happiness, contentment inherited by primitive man & are sketching the line of
destruction. <-> & fatalness. </->

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#104:2>
We are progressing & progressing but are parting <}> <-> ourselfs

Now, don't we have the feelings of lackness related to progress.

Don't we think of being satisfied with basic needs.

<ICE-IND:W1A-002#107:2>
Can't we survive with nature.
