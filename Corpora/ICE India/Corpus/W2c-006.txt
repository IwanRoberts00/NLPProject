<h> Banks asked to unearth black money </h>

<ICE-IND:W2C-006#12:2>
<@PR> NEW DELHI {#}, <@DR> Feb 26 {#} ( <@SR> PTI {#})

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#13:2>
The Union Government has sought closer coordination between banks
and tax officials to unearth black money and catch tax offenders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#14:2>
Under a recent directive, banks have been asked to take serious
note of cases where bank staff connive or assist in any manner, with offences
punishable under the Income Tax Act. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#15:2>
In such a case, in addition to normal criminal action, such staff
should also be proceeded departmentally, according to the directive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#16:2>
The directive follows increasing number of cases, where deposit
accounts have been opened <}> <-> in </-> <+> under </+> </}> fictitious
names and black money transactions have been routed through them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#17:2>
The government is also understood to be considering a proposal
to call for information <}> <-> frm </-> <+> from </+> </}> tax payers in
their tax returns on all their bank accounts, including the concerned
branch, account number, fixed deposit and interest earned on them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#18:2>
The Income Tax department is understood to be getting from the
banks ( and <}> <-> othes </-> <+> others </+> </}> ) details of deposits (
in excess of certain fixed amounts) made by the <w> bank's </w> customers.

<ICE-IND:W2C-006#19:2>
The purpose of seeking information from the tax payer would be to
have <}> <-> in </-> <+> it </+> </}> matched with the information
received from the banks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#20:2>
The computerisation of the income tax department would make
the process of matching information collected by it from outside sources
with the data supplied by the tax payers easier. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#21:2>
To enable this objective, the return forms will need to be
designed in a manner by which computer matching of information becomes
feasible, if not easier, according to the interim report of the committee on
revision of tax returns forms. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-006#22:2>
Data collected from other sources could be varied and exhaustive.

<ICE-IND:W2C-006#23:2>
To enable matching of information, the information in tax would have
to be suitably exhaustive. </p> </I>

Becker showed no signs of suffering from the tight strain
