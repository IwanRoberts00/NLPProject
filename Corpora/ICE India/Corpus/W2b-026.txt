<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#3:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THERE </smallcaps> </bold> is growing worldwide
concern over the proliferation of <quote> " junk" </quote> in space and
the threat it may pose to people on earth as well as astronauts in orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#4:1>
There is a growing awareness too that man-made debris in orbit is
also beginning to have an adverse effect on space operations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#5:1>
It is quite evident from recent observations that the rate of
failure of spacecraft and satellites in orbit is escalating in such a manner
that before long the earth will be showered with the debris of these inactive
space probes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#6:1>
Since 1957, when the Soviet <w> Union's </w> sputnik became the
first satellite to be launched, thousands of items have been in orbit around
the earth, including spent fuel tanks, rocket shells, non-functioning
satellites, fragments from satellites and rocket explosions, pieces
discarded during missions such as rocket clamps and shrouds, left-over food
packages and even shrapnel from explosions in space. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#7:1>
The latest estimates are that between 12,000 and 16,000 large
objects and pieces are not hurtling through space at speeds of thousands
of miles per hour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#8:1>
Smaller particles, primarily from some 50 or 60 explosions in space,
number in hundreds of millions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#9:1>
Moreover, the amount of debris is increasing at a rate of about 13 per
cent each year as more nations launch more and bigger rockets and satellites.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#10:1>
In accordance with the investigation made by Teledyne Brown
Engineering, it seems there are 2,433 objects in orbit which had so far been
detected and about half of the ones we know about are fragments of satellites
that have broken apart, usually as the result of an explosion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#11:1>
Of the 83 explosions that have occurred, 590 involved Russian
rockets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#12:1>
In addition, Russian antisatellite tests have added at least
500 pieces of junk to the near-earth environment.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#13:1>
With roughly 100 objects launched into space in a year - - five times
more than are launched by everyone else combined - - the Russians are
responsible for much of the pollution problem in space.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#14:1>
But the Soviet Union is not the only nation to blame.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#15:1>
Between 1973 and 1981, seven American Delta second stages
exploded, accounting for 1,176 pieces of debris. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#16:1>
The most dangerous objects are fragments of accidental
explosions because they travel so fast.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#17:1>
Even fragments as tiny as one sixteenth of an inch can penetrate most
space vehicles.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#18:1>
Space scientists fear that debris may hit and disable some of the
more than 1,100 satellites now in orbit, or puncture the manned U.S. space
shuttle, causing injury or death to astronauts. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#19:1>
<h> <bold> NO DAMAGE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#20:1>
When the nuclear-powered Soviet surveillance satellite, Cosmos
954, re-entered the <w> earth's </w> atmosphere over Canada in 1978,
following a sudden depressurization, many feared that it might spread
radiation over that country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#21:1>
But fortunately no traces of radiation were found.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#22:1>
Similarly, there was much consternation in the summer of 1979 when,
despite <w> NASA's </w> effort to ensure that the unmanned Skylab fell
either into the Indian or the Atlantic oceans, the spacecraft reentered
the <w> earth's </w> atmosphere over Australia.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#23:1>
Even though it created a brilliant display in the Australian night
sky, there was no damage. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#24:1>
Another incident, of a similar nature occurred in 1981 when the
Soviet navigation satellite, Cosmos 1275, suddenly disintegrated in
space for no apparent reason at all.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#25:1>
It is possible that because Soviet <foreign> navsats </foreign> do
not carry either internal propellant supplies or destruct packages,
disintegration of this military operational payload, a mere seven weeks
after the launch, was caused by the impact of a piece of space debris.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#26:1>
By October 1982, some 180 individual fragments of Cosmos 1275 had
been located by the North American Air Defence Command.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#27:1>
These will remain in this particular orbital slot for years to
come and will become a hazard to spacecraft orbiting in the region. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#28:1>
But what of the geostationary orbit?

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#29:1>
What hazard lies in wait there for some unsuspecting spacecraft?

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#30:1>
Fortunately, at the present time, there is not as much debris at
geostationary altitudes as nearer earth, but a potential hazard exists.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#31:1>
The USA, the Soviet Union, the European Space Agency, Japan
and India can now place spacecraft in a geosynchronous orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#32:1>
They use a technique whereby the payload and attached rocket stages
are placed <O> see below the editorial comment </O> in a low earth parking
orbit where, during the first revolution after launch, the upper rocket
stage ignites to put the payload into a geostationary transfer orbit. </p>
<&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#33:1>
<h> <bold> COMPONENTS </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#34:1>
This procedure, especialy during the Soviet launches, leaves
components in the low parking orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#35:1>
These components re-enter the atmosphere within a few days of the
launch and do not normally pose a hazard to other space traffic.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#36:1>
Once in the highly elliptical transfer orbit, with an orbital apogee
near the geosynchronous altitudes but inclined between 10 and 47 degrees (
for Soviet spacecrafts) to the equator, the launch vehicle stage is
jettisoned.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#37:1>
It remains in this orbit and poses little danger to geostationary
spacecraft. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#38:1>
When the spacecraft is separated into a similar elliptical
transfer orbit, ground commands initiate spacecrafts apogee injection
rocket motor firing at an equator crossing-point near apogee.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#39:1>
This pushes the payload into the geostationary orbit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#40:1>
It is here that one source of geosynchronous debris originates.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#41:1>
The majority of U.S. communication satellites use an apogee injection
motor which is integral to the payload structure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#42:1>
After firing, this remains a part of the spacecraft and does not
become a separate object. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#43:1>
But the Soviet communication satellites behave differently.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#44:1>
Their apogee motors are attached to the outside of the spacecrafts
structure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#45:1>
After firing, these are separated by a spring mechanism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#46:1>
Although the spacecraft is controlled from the ground and commanded
to move around the geostationary orbit until the desired location is reached,
the spent apogee motor is left to dift.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#47:1>
The Soviet apogee motors measure about two metres by two metres
and are liquid fuelled.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#48:1>
Any propellant remaining in the motor after firing is usually
vented through the engine to provide further separation from the main
spacecraft. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#49:1>
Most of these apogee motors, around 30 to date, are currently
tracked by American sensors, so their orbits and positions are known.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#50:1>
But there are about a dozen of these whch are not tracked.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#51:1>
These are drifting aimlessly and intersect the geostationary altitude
at widely varying longitudes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#52:1>
The potential for collision hazards from these apogee motors is quite
high. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#53:1>
Placing a spacecraft in a geostationary orbit is a complex
operation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#54:1>
Occasionally things go wrong and they are placed in incorrect
orbits and may or may not be under control from the ground.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#55:1>
The first and second Japanese experimental communication
satellites, for example, were both placed in incorrect orbits and are
now drifting around the earth, the first in a <quote> " sub-synchronous"
</quote> orbit below the geostationary altitude, and the second in a <quote>
" supersynchronous" </quote> orbit above the geostationary orbit in
eastward and westward directions respectively. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#56:1>
Finally, one misconception about space is that what goes up
must come down, or that space is self-cleaning.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#57:1>
Many of the satellites in the upper reaches of the orbit will never
return to the earth.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#58:1>
But most of those placed in orbits below about 300 miles, where the
atmosphere is relatively dense, either burn up or come down to the earth
within a few years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#59:1>
Above 300 miles, orbital life increases rapidly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#60:1>
At 700 miles, most spacecraft will remain in orbit for hundreds of
years.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#61:1>
Smaller fragments are more sensitive to atmospheric drag and will
re-enter earlier. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#62:1>
The removal of the sources of fragments in orbit is the most
important means of controlling the proliferation of debris.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#63:1>
<mention> NASA </mention> has already taken steps to minimize the
possibility of accidental explosions in space.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#64:1>
But an international treaty may be required to prevent intentional
explosions or to restrict them to low altitudes from which the fragments
would quickly re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#65:1>
<mention> NASA </mention> studies to determine the feasibility of
using the space shuttle to retrieve non-functioning satellites show that
about one-half of the orbiting satellites can be reached.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#66:1>
But because they were not designed to be retrieved, there could be
problems with harnessing them and storing them in the shuttle.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#67:1>
In addition, only one satellite can be recovered on each launch
since the shuttle does not usually have sufficient fuel to pursue and
capture a second satellite.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#68:1>
For these reasons, retrieval by the space shuttle may be too
expensive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#69:1>
On the other hand, disposal of a space satellite is more
economical when it is planned before the satellite is launched.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#70:1>
Only a small force will cause a satellite to re-enter the atmosphere,
and that force can come from small rockets added to the spacecraft.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#71:1>
Gravitational forces of the sun and the moon can also be used to
alter the orbit of an object so that it re-enters the atmosphere. </p> <&>

<h> <bold> COLLISION </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#73:1>
It is obviously necessary to remove debris for the safety of
satellites.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#74:1>
The probability of devastating impact on permanent facilities like
the manned space station planned for the 1990s causes concern.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#75:1>
Though the threat of space junk is now most serious in orbits between
540 and 600 miles up in the sky - - above that of the space station - - much
of this material will <quote> " rain down" </quote> to lower regions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#76:1>
As a result, the station may collide with an object large enough
to penetrate it as often as once every 10 years and it will be pelted by
smaller debris and micrometeoroids much more often. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-026#77:1>
In conclusion, it can be said that several procedures can
reduce the risk of future space missions from orbital debris.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#78:1>
Some of these are expensive; others are not.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#79:1>
But the problem must be faced, Future space structures, designed for
long missions, are likely to be larger and lighter with the use of composite
material and, therefore, even more sensitive to penetration by small
pieces of manmade objects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-026#80:1>
Adding the weight required to protect such structures from
space debris may well increase the cost of space activities so much that
future space missions may become too expensive to be undertaken. </p>

<bold> <smallcaps> POINTING </smallcaps> </bold> out that thousands
of items discarded from space missions, as well as disabled satellites, are
orbitting the earth Sanat Biswas, a nuclear engineer scientist, says that
unless ways are found to remove them, such debris will pose a serious hazard
to future space explorations.

According to Professor Biswas, while satellites can be removed,
the problem that smaller objects pose for permanent structures like a
space station may prove difficult to solve. </p> </it> </&> </I>
