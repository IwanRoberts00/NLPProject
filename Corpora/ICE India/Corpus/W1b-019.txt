<ICE-IND:W1B-019#3:1>
In response to the oral instructions of the Vice-Chancellor,  
Professor K. B. Pawar, I am submitting below my scheme on the
further  
development of the research activities of the <indig> Kendra
</indig> , for  
the consideration of the University authorities. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#4:1>
The scheme has been divided into four parts : 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#5:1>
( 1) introduction, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#6:1>
( 2) achievements, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#7:1>
( 3) expectations, and lastly 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#8:1>
( 4) realization of the expectations. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#9:1>
A) <h> <ul> INTRODUCTION </ul> : </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#10:1>
Kolhapur has been an independent and vibrant
centre of research  
in Maratha history since the turn of the century, when <indig>
Rajarshi  
</indig> Shahu <indig> Chatrapati </indig> ( 1874 - 1922)
encouraged the  
writing of a biography of Shivaji the great and provided with
kind and  
generous <}> <-> partonage </-> <+> patronage </+> </}> to
Professor V. G.  
Vijapurkar to edit <indig> <ul> Granthmala </ul> , </indig>
through which a  
series of research volumes, containing source-material were
published. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#11:1>
It should be remembered that the third, fifth and
eighth volumes of  
<indig> <ul> Marathyancya Itihasachi Sadhane </ul> </indig>
edited by <indig>  
Itihasacharya </indig> V. K. Rajwade were published from
Kolhapur in 1901,  
1905 and 1903 respectively. </p> 

<O> <&> continued to page 2 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 2 </O>

 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#12:1>
Shahaji <indig> Chhatrapati </indig> of Kolhapur
continued the  
tradition of his grand father and brought forth thirteen
volumes containing  
source-material from Modi - Marathi and Portuguese languages,
bearing on the  
history of Marathas and ably edited by researchers like M. V.
Gujar, <indig>  
Shri </indig> S. M. Garge and Dr. S. P. Shirodkar. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#13:1>
Dr. A. G. Pawar, an eminent researcher in Maratha
history, as the  
first vice-chancellor of Shivaji University managed to
collect, translate and  
edit in ten volumes a number of Modi-Marathi, Portuguese and
Persian  
documents, with the help of some research assistants and
members of the  
department of History. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#14:1>
There was, however, a great need to
institutionalize this  
research work. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#15:1>
B) <h> <ul> SHAHU <indig> SAMSHODHAN KENDRA </indig> :
ACHIEVEMENTS  
</ul> </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#16:1>
Shahu <indig> Samshodhan Kendra </indig> was
inaugurated by the  
then Chancellor and Governor, Nawab Ali Yavar Jang on 28 May
1970, during the  
vice-chancellorship of Dr. A. G. Pawar. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#17:1>
In view of the birth centenary of <indig> Rajashri
</indig> Shahu  
<indig> Chhatrapati </indig> in whose name 

<O> <&> page continued on 3 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 3 </O>

the <indig> Kendra </indig> was founded, the  
work of collecting source material on his life and the work
was earnestly  
undertaken. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#18:1>
The first volume entitled <ul> <indig> Rajarshi
</indig> Shahu  
<indig> Chhatrapati </indig> Papers </ul> : 1884 - 1894
Adoption to  
Installation was published in 1976. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#19:1>
The work however, could not gain momentum due to
the ill health  
of the first director and other problems regarding the nature
and finances of  
the <indig> Kendra </indig> </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#20:1>
After overcoming these problems, Shivaji
University appointed Dr.  
V. A. Sangwe the Director and asked Dr. B. D. Khane of the
department of  
History to associate with the work of the <indig> Kendra
</indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#21:1>
The second, third and fourth volumes of the series
<indig> Rajarshi  
</indig> Shahu <indig> Chhatrapati </indig> Papers edited
jointly by Dr. V.  
A. Sangwe and Dr. B. D. Khane have been so far published in
years 1983, 1985  
and 1988 respectively. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#22:1>
C) <h> <ul> SHAHU <indig> SAMSHODHAN KENDRA </indig> :
EXPECTATIONS  
</ul> </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#23:1>
Though publication of source-material is an
important activity of  
an essentially historical research institute, there are also
other equally  
important functions, <ul> viz. </ul> : 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#24:1>
( 1) managing a research library, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#25:1>
( 2) administering an archival cell, 

<O> <&> continued on page 4 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O>


<ICE-IND:W1B-019#26:1>
( 3) training young researchers, 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#27:1>
( 4) providing a meeting place for research scholars
and 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#28:1>
( 5) diversification of research activity. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#29:1>
( 1) <h> <ul> Research Library </ul> : </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#30:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> has at present a
nucleus of a <-> a  
research library formed by the books donated by Dr. A. G.
Pawar, Dhananjay  
Keer and Madhvrao Bagal. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#31:1>
It would be necessary to purchase referance books from
the  
book-sellers, and approach some old colleges with a request to
donate  
referance books which could be properly maintained and better
used in the  
<indig> Kendra </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#32:1>
The other research institutes like Bharat <indig>
Itihas Samshodhak  
Mandal </indig> ( Pune), Deccan College ( Pune) along with the
libraries of  
Poona and Bombay Universities could be approached for
borrowing books and  
periodicals. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#33:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> could also get photocopies
of reference  
books from Shivaji University library. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#34:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> could prepare a list
of  
refrence-books and periodicals available in the libraries of
Rajaram College  
( Kolhapur), Willingdon College ( Sangli) and Dayanand College
( Solapur)  
which would be useful for the researchers. </p> 
<O> <&> continued on page 5 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 5 </O>


<ICE-IND:W1B-019#35:1>
( 2) <h> <ul> Archival Cell </ul> : </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#36:1>
The sources-material useful for rewriting the
socio-economic  
history of Maharashtra is available in Kolhapur, Pune, Bombay,
Bikaner,  
Sitamau ( M.P.), and National archives. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#37:1>
It is also available in the British Museum and India
Office library  
London. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#38:1>
In order to enhance the quality of research-work
it is necessary  
for a researcher to consult these documents. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#39:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> should start the
development of microfilm  
library of these documents. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#40:1>
Similarly the microfilms, if not the originals, of the
documents of  
historic families and newspapers could be made. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#41:1>
Some documents could be photo-copied and preserved in
the Cell. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#42:1>
The archival cell would be of immense use to our
young  
researchers. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#43:1>
( 3) <h> <ul> Association of Young Researchers </ul> :
</h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#44:1>
There is a great and urgent need to harness the
energy of  
promising young student-researchers in the work of the <indig>
Kendra  
</indig> . <O> <&> contined on page 6 </&> </O> <O> <&> page
</&> 6 </O> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#45:1>
These researchers could compile the documents and some
of them could  
shoulder the responsibility of writing historical accounts of
socio-economic  
systems and movements. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#46:1>
The students could be trained in reading Modi-Marathi,
Portuguese and  
Persian documents. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#47:1>
The researchers could contribute articles which could
be read in  
seminars and conferences. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#48:1>
( 4) <h> <ul> Meeting Place of Scholars </ul> : </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#49:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> could organise <}> <->
an </-> <+> on  
</+> </}> specific dates every year an annual seminar when
researchers in  
India could come to the <indig> Kendra </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#50:1>
The young student-researchers from the University area
could  
contribute their research papers in the seminar and would be
benefitted by  
the academic contact with renowned scholars. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#51:1>
( 5) <h> <ul> Diversification of Research Activity
</ul> : </h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#52:1>
There is an urgent need of expediting the
publication of  
documents, from the archives, relating to the life and work of
Shahu <indig>  
Chhatrapati </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#53:1>
Simultaneously there is need of diversifying research
activities of  
the <indig> Kendra </indig> , which could concentrate on 

<O> <&> contined on page 7 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 7 </O> 

the socio-economic history of the  
four districts coming under the jurisdiction of Shivaji
University. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#54:1>
It could also divert its attention to the nearby
western coast with  
which the Kolhapur state was in contact. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#55:1>
The study of historic families like the Patwardhans,
Nipanikars,  
Kagalkar, Kapashikar, Ichalkaranjikar, Jatkar, Akkalkotkar and
Shaikh Mira of  
Wai - - would be most relevant. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#56:1>
Similarly the thematic studies like agriculture,
trade, industry,  
commerce and religious centres in the region would be worth
further analysis. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#57:1>
The relations of Kolhapur state with other Indian and
European powers  
would <del> be </del> reveal interesting information. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#58:1>
Similarly Kolhapur and the adjoining region is famous
for its  
archeological remains, art, architecture, sculpture and film
industry. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#59:1>
In short, there is <del> need </del> indeed great
scope for  
diversifying the research activity of the <indig> Kendra
</indig> and it  
should be undertaken in phased programme which is a necessity
in view of the  
<}> <-> abailability </-> <+> availability </+> </}> of
personnel and  
resources. </p> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#60:1>
D) <h> <ul> REALIZATION OF THE EXPECTATIONS </ul> :
</h> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#61:1>
It is easy to express the expectations, though its

<O> <&> contined on page 8 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 8 </O> 

realization would  
require concerted and purposeful effort, backed by financial
support. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#62:1>
The University authorities should think of
providing the <indig>  
Kendra </indig> with the necessary infrastructure. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#63:1>
1) <h> <ul> Space </ul> : </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#64:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> would require sufficient
space to house  
reference library, archival cell, reading room and rooms for
the staff. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#65:1>
2) <h> <ul> Personnel </ul> : </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#66:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> could develop a library of
microfilms of  
documents collected from variious archives. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#67:1>
The necessary technical equipment and assistance
should be made  
available to the <indig> Kendra </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#68:1>
It could also utilise the services of modi scribes,
and persons  
conversant with Persian, Portuguese language on
contract/salary basis. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#69:1>
The <indig> Kendra </indig> could chalk out a course
of training  
young researchers through direct participation, in these
historic languages  
and scripts. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#70:1>
3) <h> <ul> Publication </ul> : </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#71:1>
The University authorities could explore the
possibility of  
modernising the printing process which would expedite the
research activity  
of the publication of source-material. </p> 

<O> <&> continued on page 9 </&> </O> <O> <&> page </&> 9 </O>

 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#72:1>
4) <h> <ul> Finances </ul> : </h> 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#73:1>
It would be necessary to raise sufficient funds
through the funding  
agencies like the U.G.C., alongwith the public and private
concerns in the  
region. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#74:1>
The realization of the expectations would be
possible in a  
gradual manner with the availability of above mentioned
requirements. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#109:1>
Sir, 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#110:1>
1. We have started Shivaji <indig> Vidyapeeth
Itihas Pradhyapak  
Parishad </indig> ( Registration No. Maharashtra / 10576 /
F-10467 / Kolhapur )  
with the office in the Department of History Shivaji
University, Kolhapur. 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#111:1>
At present, I am the President of the <indig>
Parishad </indig> ,  
which has one hundred fifty two college teachers from the
jurisdiction of the  
Shivaji University as the life members of the <indig> Parishad
</indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#112:1>
We have, so far, organised three annual seminars with
the help of  
local colleges at Satara ( 1992), Talmavale ( 1993) and Miraj
( 1994). 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#113:1>
In these three seminars forty seven research-papers
were presented  
by the members of the <indig> parishad </indig> . 

<ICE-IND:W1B-019#114:1>
The <indig> Parishad </indig> wishes to publish
thirty seven papers  
in one volume, which we intend to release at Solapur, the
venue of our fourth  
annual seminar in November 17-19,1995. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#115:1>
2. I request the University authorities to print
this volume on  
no-profit-no loss basis in the Shivaji University press. </p> 
 
<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1B-019#116:1>
3. The volume would run into 325 pages demi-size.
