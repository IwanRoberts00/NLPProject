For slowly, almost imperceptibly, in the last few decades,
Buddhism, once a strictly oriental religion, has captured hearts and minds in
distant lands.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#10:1>
And it is not <w> Buddhism's </w> clouds of incense, flickering
butter lamps and gorgeous red-and-gold images that entrance this new breed of
followers, but the 2,500-year-old philosophy of a man who, followers believe,
peered into the heart of the universe. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#11:1>
Siddhartha was born around 563 BC.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#12:1>
His father was a monarch who went to enormous lengths to shield his
sensitive son from the unpleasant aspects of life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#13:1>
But when Siddhartha was 29, during his first few ventures outside the
palace grounds, he encountered suffering, sickness and death. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#14:1>
After days of turmoil, Siddhartha left the palace in search of
answers to the questions that haunted him.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#15:1>
Years of wandering and introspection led him to Gaya, where he sat
under a <it> <indig> peepal </indig> </it> tree and went into a trance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#16:1>
He emerged from his meditation a Buddha, or an Awakened One. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#17:1>
During his moment of realisation, Siddhartha understood that
the self is an illusion and that all is impermanent.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#18:1>
He outlined the Four Truths; that misery exists, that misery
originates from within us, that this can be eliminated, and that this
elimination is the result of a methodical path that must be followed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#19:1>
The Buddha prescribed the Eightfold Path, consisting of basic
rules like right thinking, right speech and right living, which would help
the individual to escape from the cycle of life and death and to attain
nirvana. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#20:1>
While about 200 million people in Asia, mainly Thailand, Japan,
Sri Lanka, Tibet, Burma and Vietnam, are Buddhist by tradition, a large
number of people from other religious backgrounds are becoming Buddhist,
or at least adopting some aspects of the religion. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#21:1>
In Hollywood, Buddhism has displaced environmental
consciousness as the fad of the moment and the Dalai Lama has been elevated
to the status of a pop icon.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#22:1>
While actor Richard Gere has reportedly donated over a million
dollars to the exiled Tibetan leader, other big names like Harrison Ford,
Shirley MacLaine, Jane Fonda and Meg Ryan are also among the famous and the
faithful Bernardo Bertolucci, whose film, <it> The Little Buddha </it> ,
was released last month, says that his foray into the religion has changed
him.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#23:1>
<quote> " I have come to realise what a great religion Buddhism is,"
</quote> says the maker of the film, which interweaves the story of
Siddhartha with the search of <it> lamas </it> from Bhutan for a
reincarnation of a great teacher. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#24:1>
While American interest in Buddhism is relatively new, 19th
century British scholars like Christmas Humphreys and I B Horner started
societies like the Pali Text Society and the Buddhist Society about 70
years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#25:1>
<quote> " These groups were purely academic in nature," </quote> says
R Sirkar, chairman of the United Lodge of Theosophists.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#26:1>
<quote> " But gradually the interest became more religious and
other groups began to appear which accepted Buddhism as a way of life.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#27:1>
This is probably related to the crisis in Christianity in the
West." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#28:1>
The 26-year-old Western Buddhist Order started by Sangarakshita, a
British monk, is a perfect example.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#29:1>
The organisation, one among about 30 similar groups in the UK, has
600 members, many of whom live in single-sex communities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#30:1>
Regular classes are conducted both on the teachings of Buddhism and
on meditation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#31:1>
The <w> group's </w> magazine, <it> <mention> The Golden Drum
</mention> </it> , keeps members up to date about monasteries being
constructed in Queensland and retreats being built on Scottish islands.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#32:1>
Most members wandered into the order for a dollop of yoga and
meditation and stayed for spirItual seconds.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#33:1>
And while many of the <w> group's </w> early members were long-haired
hippies who might just as easily have drifted into the portals of a
Scientology church or a Moonies temple, the newer followers are clean-cut
professionals with an educated interest in Buddhism. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#34:1>
The growing awareness of Buddhism has, to a great extent, been
created by the sudden presence of Tibetan monks in diverse parts of the
world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#35:1>
In 1959, over 1,00,000 Tibetans fled their homeland, which had
been annexed by the Chinese.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#36:1>
While most Tibetans settled in India, some went to parts of Europe
and America.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#37:1>
Concerned about the survival of their culture, they began to build
monasteries and libraries.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#38:1>
And in order to fund themselves, they began to conduct meditation
and yoga classes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#39:1>
Indeed, Tibetan and other Buddhist groups are mushrooming around
the world.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#40:1>
And even if their teachings contradict each <w> others' </w> ,
their followers don't really care.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#41:1>
<quote> " There are thousands of paths to the truth," </quote> says
Rev Prof Kohilavatta Anandathera of the Bahujan Vihar Trust in Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#42:1>
<quote> " Each must find his own." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#43:1>
It is this acceptance of individual beliefs and tolerance towards
different, even contradictory, opinions that seems to attract the rational
seekers of religion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#44:1>
<quote> " I was born a Christian but when I read about Buddhism, I
found it very appealing," </quote> says Dhammachari Lokamitra, a
Pune-based member of the Western Buddhist Order.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#45:1>
<quote> " I liked tolerance and the fact that there is no greater
God in Buddhism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#46:1>
Buddha is not God, but an enlightened man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#47:1>
He only shows us the way.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#48:1>
We too can attain <indig> nirvana </indig> if we follow his path.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#49:1>
Buddhism does not demand blind belief.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#50:1>
It encourages you to question and investigate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#51:1>
More than any other religion, I feel it meets the needs of the modern
man." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#52:1>
<quote> " I feel Buddhism has the most practical approach to
life," </quote> agrees Babloo Sen, the director of a Bombay school, who
meditates regularly with a group of friends.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#53:1>
<quote> " In a way Buddhism is similar to courses like EST and Silva
Mind Control which believe that you have the power to make anything
happen.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#54:1>
These courses, however, try to change attitudes without
spirituality and so their impact is limited.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#55:1>
By following the techniques of Buddhism, you can control your
mind, transform your thoughts, change your attitude, and so improve your
<indig> <it> karma </it> </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#56:1>
There is no mumbo jumbo about sin and superstition.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#57:1>
Just straight psychological facts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#58:1>
Undoubtedly this is the religion of today." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#59:1>
While Sen still calls herself a Hindu, her friend and
meditation-mate Behroze Khajotia, who was born a Zoroastrian, admits that she
considers herself a Buddhist. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#60:1>
<quote> " When I started reading about Buddhlism and doing
yoga in 1991, I didn't know what I was in for," </quote> says Khajotia, a
researcher at TOMCO, who became interested in the religion when her
cousin, who has studied under many of the great Buddhist teachers, started
conducting meditation classes in Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#61:1>
<quote> " I was a practising Parsi.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#62:1>
I said my prayers and did everything a good Parsi girl should.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#63:1>
But the more I read about Buddhism, the more involved I became.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#64:1>
I was very drawn by the openness and tolerance of the religion.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#65:1>
Buddhism challenges us to question the validity of our beliefs and
assumptions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#66:1>
It has certainly made a huge difference in my life." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#67:1>
While Khajotia says that her new-found beliefs have helped
her to snap out of her habitual depression.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#68:1>
Sen says that Buddhism has made her more humble and considerate.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#69:1>
</quote> " It has turned my life upside down." <quote> she says.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#70:1>
<quote> " For example, I used to be an avid TV and movie watcher.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#71:1>
I couldn't sleep unless I watched a movie every night.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#72:1>
And then suddenly, one day, I was not interested in movies
anymore.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#73:1>
I felt I had many more important things to do - - books to read,
people to talk to.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#74:1>
Really, it was most peculiar." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#75:1>
Sen and Khajotia are part of a group of middle-class Bombayites
who have consciously adopted a Buddhist teacher and a philosophy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#76:1>
And like them numerous groups of middle-class Indians,
especially in Bangalore and Delhi, are rediscovering the religion that was
born here so long ago. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#77:1>
Indeed, while the West is still flirting with Buddhism, in India
the religion has seen violent fluctuations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#78:1>
While practically the state religion of the Mauryan and Kushan
dynasties, Buddhism vanished from India by the 12th century.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#79:1>
This was probably a consequence of the destruction of the great
universities, like Nalanda and Takshashila, and the massacre of monks by
invaders. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-019#80:1>
There were few Buddhists in the country till Dr Babasaheb
Ambedkar, disillusioned by the Hindu caste system, called on the
oppressed lower castes to unite under the rather more egalitarian Buddhism.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#81:1>
Ambedkar, along with 2,00,000 followers, converted in 1956.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#82:1>
And although many view this as a social rather than a religious
statement.

<ICE-IND:W2B-019#83:1>
Anandathera, who works with <w> Bombay's </w> Ambedkarites, is
optimistic. </p>

Indeed, for believers, this sudden movement towards Buddhism, in
India and around the world, is no fad but the realisation of the long

Buddhism to Tibet.
