<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#1:1:A>
<O> One word </O> <{> <[> Sushila </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#2:1:C>
<[> So Shushilaji </[> </{> when are we leaving to your place
<,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#3:1:B>
<w> I'm </w> leaving on the twenty ninth of <,> <{> <[> <O> one
word </O> </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#4:1:C>
<[> What is </[> </{> your impression of Mysore last year <,>
and <{> <[> whether you like </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#5:1:B>
<[> Mysore is </[> </{> a beautiful city <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#6:1:B>
I liked it very much <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#7:1:C>
I never imagined that <w> it's </w> a beautiful city <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#8:1:C>
Perhaps <,> because I stayed in Lucknow Hostel and even <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#9:1:A>
Yeah Lucknow used to be very very hot <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#10:1:A>
And <,> when I came to Mysore <,> I came here <,,> with the
intention of visiting a new city <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#11:1:A>
I didn't have any idea about the weather <,> in Mysore <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#12:1:A>
When I <,> reached Bangalore <,,> uh I asked my sister how Mysore
would be like <,> and she said that <,,> uh well it would be as good as
Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#13:1:A>
Now I <,> come to know that my sister was uh <,,> right in a way
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#14:1:A>
But you know <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#15:1:A>
Now

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#16:1:C>
I don't know about Sushila <,> she is she <O> one or two words
</O> all that and Asok is also <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#17:1:A>
Now <,> I see you <,,> can we <O> one word </O> <,,> uh it
proved to be a bit <O> cough </O> troublesome <,> for me Sushila <,> of
course <,> you are there <,> and <w> I'm </w> surrounded by <,> friends like
you and Patil and Asok and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#18:1:A>
I don't miss my home as much <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#19:1:C>
But even then <,,> <{1> <[1> <O> one word </O> </[1> made
quite long <{2> <[2> <O> one or two words </O> </[2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#20:1:C>
<[1> Now </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#21:1:B>
<[2> One month is a long <,,> time </[2> </{2> to be away from
home <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#22:1:A>
And especially <,,> food <,,> and when you come back <,> to my
to your room <,> uh you don't exactly like a warm <,> <{> <[> <w> that's </w>
</[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#23:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> especially in the evening <,> when you
returned <,> from from the institute you feel rather home sick <,> <{> <[>
yeah yeah <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#24:1:B>
To enter the empty room <,> when nobody is there to <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#25:1:A>
<[> Yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#26:1:A>
Of course with Sushila with with <{> <[> neighbour </[> you
<,,> there is a kind of compensation <,> kind of uh sisterly <,> daughterly
<,> <{1> <[1> yeah <,> persons <,> that the cheerful charming sweet and all
that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#27:1:A>
But then we know <,> that this is a kind of a medicine <,> <{2>
<[2> yeah <,> the family insists on but <,> it is illusion

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#28:1:B>
<[> I know </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#29:1:B>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#30:1:C>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#31:1:C>
Suddenly you begin to feel early in evening <,> she is always
there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#32:1:C>
But you know <,> up to the twenty first of June <,> I think you got
<?> whole </?> long Sushila

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#33:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#34:1:A>
And now <,> when <w> I'm </w> <,> as if <w> I'm </w> out of
job <,,> because <{> <[> the part of job it is yeah </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#35:1:B>
<[> Part of job it is yeah </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#36:1:A>
Before she <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#37:1:B>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#38:1:A>
There is no worry <,> formerly I used to think about my lesson
moreover what shall I talk

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#39:1:C>
Exactly exactly to keep you busy

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#40:1:A>
Yeah it kept me mentally busy <,> and now <w> I'm </w> <,>
attending this classes <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#41:1:C>
Unless I <?> must </?> say

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#42:1:A>
I have got nothing else nothing to do <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#43:1:A>
So <,> in first the first thing that seem <O> one word </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#44:1:C>
I would I will say participate like that

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#45:1:A>
<{> <[> It clearly give it a hope </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#46:1:B>
<[> Hope hope </[> </{> you know

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#47:1:A>
I just I just <,> missed it <,,> all hope <,> now this is no
<?> eat </?> for <,> getting to missed it <,> so the only thing is that <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#48:1:C>
I don't know but I think uh

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#49:1:A>
It was a very good experience uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#50:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#51:1:A>
<O> A few words </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#52:1:B>
We had a nice time together <,> all of us <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#53:1:A>
And this evening we spent about half an hour <,,> uh uh with
Sushila <,> uh talking about the <indig> sarees </indig> that she <O> one
word </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#54:1:C>
The blanket on a blanket <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#55:1:A>
Blanket with the shawl that she has done <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#56:1:A>
And my <O> one word </O> <,> we started talking about <,> uh
colours <,> patterns and <O> one or two words </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#57:1:C>
<w> We're </w> <{> <[> just allowed because <O> one or two
words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#58:1:A>
<[> Which colour will go </[> </{> with that person <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#59:1:A>
And uh by the by the way it is interesting that <w> that's </w> <w>
we've </w> got <,> this thing about the Indian beauty <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#60:1:A>
Especial reference to <,> women <,> and uh <,> Sushila was one of
the main person <,> but she didn't feel embarrassed <O> laughter </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#61:1:A>
A statement about <,,> her and uh

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#62:1:C>
Short nose <,,> tall <,,> uh reminding of uh <,,> classical
<,> upbringing and all that <,> <w> she's </w> from Madras

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#63:1:B>
That was a very compliment <,> <.> comp </.> comprehending
with uh historical persons <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#64:1:A>
Complimenting <,> compliment uh compliment they are true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#65:1:A>
Otherwise she would feel uh <,> furious <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#66:1:A>
There is no embarrassing thinking but uhm <,,> these are the
features and especially the sharp long nose <,> and I think of that

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#67:1:C>
Who is this lady <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#68:1:A>
Uh <,> I don't have uh Rajasthani painting <,> uh Kishangarh
school and all that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#69:1:A>
You will find that uh most <,,> uh women <,> who are usually
dressed <,> as they were queens <,,> uh people of royal family <,> they acted
like <,> a you know each and <O> one or two words </O> <&> cough </&> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#70:1:A>
Unless you think of it <,> you you relaxed <,> when it loses us
<,,> it occurred to me there is something there <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#71:1:A>
And I wouldn't fall on it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#72:1:A>
But today we started talking about it <,> and then you know uh <,>
you get uh uh uh <O> a few words </O> <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#73:1:C>
So uh <,,> now that <w> I'm </w> leaving on the twenty seventh
<O> a few words </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#74:1:A>
And you are all alone <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#75:1:B>
How long uh <,> will be your journey <,> uh perhaps

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#76:1:C>
Actually if I <,> leave this place and go straight to Burdwan
then it won't take uh <,,> uh very long time compare to other such thing like
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#77:1:B>
Longest <,> <{> <[> longest <,> longest way <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#78:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#94:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#97:1:C>
But everything will lack <O> one word </O> <,> when I am in
Bangalore in my sister <,,> because uh now is my problem <,> I find <,,> I
would have to <,,> yeah take care of lots of things

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#98:1:A>
<[> Salem </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#99:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#100:1:A>
Then it was a

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#101:1:C>
Cannot move that on the way <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#102:1:A>
Yeah yeah <,> depends upon the reservation train time and <O>
a few words </O> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#103:1:A>
And uh though there are <O> one word </O> although uh <,> I wish

<ICE-IND:S1A-034#104:1:A>
In fact <w> I'll </w>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#105:1:C>
So that is how <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#106:1:A>
You are going to <O> one word </O> children

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-034#120:1:C>
<w> That's </w> right <,,>
