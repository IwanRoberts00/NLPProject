<bold> In the nuclear energy field, the consciousness of safety,
the planning of facilities and operations to ensure safety, the methods for
monitoring to ensure compliance with safety standards, as well as the record
of safety have been of a very high standard, in contrast to the situation
with respect to control of hazards from chemical pollutants.

<h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#6:1>
Mankind is reaping immense benefits from the application of
nuclear energy in various fields - - power production, medicine, industry,
agriculture and research.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#7:1>
We know that any facet of human advance involves acceptance of some
risk, and radiation is no exception.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#8:1>
We have to balance risks vs benefits and arrive at an optimum
solution.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#9:1>
In the nuclear energy field, the consciousness of safety, the
planning of facilities and operations to ensure safety, the constant
review and updating of risk estimates in the light of newer knowledge, the
methods for monitoring to ensure compliance with safety standards, as well
as the record of safety are unparalled, Chernobyl notwithstanding.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#10:1>
In contrast, the situation with respect to control of hazards from
chemical pollutants is grim.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#11:1>
Bhopal was the worst industrial disaster in history, but it is clear
that we have learnt very little from <mention> Bhopal </mention> in terms of
corrective measures that have been instituted by the chemical industry
community anywhere in the world.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#12:1>
The response of nuclear experts to Chernobyl stands in refreshing
contrast. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#13:1>
The philosophy, methodologies, techniques and the data bases that
the radiation protection community has evolved are of great relevance in the
wider context of <mention> environmental protection </mention> , <mention>
public health </mention> and <mention> industrial safety </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#14:1>
Whereas we have extensive knowledge on the long-term effects of
low level ionizing radiation, there is very little corresponding
information for the thousands of chemicals in extensive use.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#15:1>
Generally the immediate toxic effects are those that determine the
setting of limits ( like TLV ) for chemicals.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#16:1>
Because of this wide difference in our knowledge in the two cases,
attempts have been made to equate the hazardous effects of chemicals in
terms of a unit called <mention> REC </mention> , radiation equivalent
chemical. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#17:1>
<h> <bold> INPUTS TOWARDS SAFETY IN NUCLEAR ENERGY APPLICATIONS
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#18:1>
Around 10 - 15 % of the total capital costs of major systems like
a nuclear power plant go towards safety features such as shields and
stacks.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#19:1>
Similarly around 5 - 10 % of running costs and manpower are devoted
to safety maintenance, whether it is a major activity like operating a
nuclear reactor or a much smaller activity like running a radiotherapy or
nuclear medicine department.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#20:1>
In this connection it is instructive to have a look at the figures
for our nuclear energy activities.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#21:1>
The data have been kindly supplied by Sri S.D. Soman, Director,
Health and Safety Group, BARC ( Soman, 1988 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#22:1>
We have around 34,000 radiation workers ( 12,300 in the
establishments of the Department of Atomic Energy and 21,500 in non-DAE
establishments, mainly in diagnostic X-ray departments and other medical
applications as well as some industrial and research application areas ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#23:1>
There are around 820 scientific staff in DAE who are dedicated to
looking after the safety of these workers, giving a figure of one safety
person per 41 radiation workers.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#24:1>
In fact, around 45 % of these workers do not get any radiation dose
at all.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#25:1>
If this is taken into account, there is one safety person per 23
workers with non-zero dose.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#26:1>
The annual per capita expenditure on the safety of each radiation
worker getting non-zero dose is Rs. <O> <&> page </&> 883 </O> 2660/-. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#27:1>
<h> <bold> THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY ( IAEA )
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#28:1>
<mention> IAEA </mention> has brought out so far around 1150
publications.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#29:1>
Out of these 28 % are listed directly under the heading <quote> `
nuclear safety and environmental protection' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#30:1>
Another 3 % deals with <quote> ` radiation biology, dosimetry and
pollution studies' </quote> , which are directly concerned with protection.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#31:1>
In addition, another 8 % is concerned with <quote> ` reactor control
instrumentation, reliability, inspection and quality assurance' </quote>
which have a direct bearing on safety.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#32:1>
Thus around 40 % of the total publications deal with safety.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#33:1>
Is there a similar parallel in any of the other industries or
occupations ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#34:1>
The International Nuclear Information System ( INIS ) is
comprehensive, systematically organised and standardised.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#35:1>
Information retrieval with respect to any aspect of nuclear energy is
easy and quick.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#36:1>
For example, full details of alI power and research reactors all over
the world are available at one place.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#37:1>
Can we hope to get information at short notice about any of the
chemical plants that are potentially hazardous, say, those producing
pesticides ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#38:1>
In 1974 <mention> IAEA </mention> initiated a programme on Nuclear
Power Plant Safety Standards ( NUSS ) , which today consist of 5 Codes of
Practice and 60 Guides giving procedures for implementing the Codes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#39:1>
Ater the 3 mile Island accident in 1979 <w> <mention> IAEA's
</mention> </w> safety programme was reviewed, and in 1981 a separate
Division of Nuclear Safety was established.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#40:1>
Several elements were added, including Operational Safety Review
Teams ( OSART ) , the Incident Reporting System ( IRS ) , and an
International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group ( INSAG ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#41:1>
<mention> IAEA </mention> seeks to promote emergency planning and
preparedness.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#42:1>
Guidelines were developed in 1984 for mutual emergency assistance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#43:1>
In 1985 a Radiation Protection Advisory Team ( RAPAT ) was
established to deal with non-power applications of nuclear energy.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#44:1>
What about Chernobyl ?

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#45:1>
The international nuclear community was partially prepared even
before the accident for managing an event like Chernobyl.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#46:1>
Immediately after the accident <mention> IAEA </mention> received
information on fallout levels from various countries and helped to a
certain extent in the dissemination of information.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#47:1>
But, in the overall context, as Hans Blix, the Director-General
of <mention> IAEA </mention> handsomely admits, important elements
were missing in a viable international safety regime ( Blix, 1987 ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#48:1>
But <mention> IAEA </mention> has not spared any effort to learn from
Chernobyl and has expeditiously taken all appropriate corrective measures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#49:1>
Within a month of the accident, texts of two conventions, namely
early notification convention and convention on assistance in the event of a
nuclear accident or radiological emergency, were adopted.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#50:1>
The weak links in the chain were identified and action taken by
the <mention> IAEA </mention> for better information exchange, man-machine
interface, operator qualifications, international accreditation of
training programmes, fire protection, medical judgement, and biological
dosimetry. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#51:1>
<h> <bold> <mention> lCRP </mention> PHlLOSOPHY AND METHODOLOGIES
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#52:1>
The International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP )
makes periodic recommendations on all aspects of radiological protection.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#53:1>
Although it is only an Advisory Body, its recommendations have been
unanimously accepted by each and every country in the world, as well as by
international organisations like <mention> WHO </mention> , <mention> FAO
</mention> , <mention> ILO </mention> and <mention> IAEA </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#54:1>
<mention> lCRP </mention> has brought out so far 55 publications
running into about 7000 pages.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#55:1>
<w> <mention> ICRP's </mention> </w> policy is to consider the
fundamental principles upon which radiation protection measures can be
based.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#56:1>
Because of the differing conditions that apply in various
countries, detailed guidelines on the applications of its
recommendations, either in regulations or codes of practice, are to be
elaborated by the appropriate national or international bodies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#57:1>
For this reason, <w> <mention> ICRP's </mention> </w> recommendations
provide a degree of flexibility.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#58:1>
<mention> ICRP </mention> defines the objective of radiation
protection as follows : <quote> ` Radiation protection is concerned with the
protection of individuals, their progeny, and mankind as a whole, while still
allowing necessary activities from which radiation exposure might result.'
</quote>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#59:1>
The level of safety required for the protection of humans is thought
likely to be adequate to protect other species as well. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#60:1>
<h> <bold> Detrimental effects against which protection is required
</bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#61:1>
The detrimental effects against which protection is required are
Somatic and Hereditary.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#62:1>
Somatic effects become manifest in the exposed individual himself and
hereditary effects affect his descendents.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#63:1>
<mention> ICRP </mention> makes a distinction between stochastic and
non-stochastic effects.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#64:1>
Non-stochastic effects are those for which the severity of the effect
varies with the dose, and for which there is likely to be a threshold <O> <&>
page </&> 884 </O> dose below which no detrimental effects are seen.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#65:1>
Examples are cataract, damage to bone marrow leading to blood
deficiencies ( like anaemia ) , impaired fertility, etc. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#66:1>
Stochastic effects are those for which the probability of an
effect occurring, rather than its severity, is a function of the dose.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#67:1>
To be on the safe side it is conservatively assumed that stochastic
effects have no threshold; even the smallest dose does have a probability of
producing the effect.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#68:1>
Cancer induction and hereditary effects are the major causes of
concern in stochastic effects.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#69:1>
To illustrate the nature of the stochastic effect, we may notice
that when a person gets leukaemia as a result of radiation exposure,
whether he gets the disease from a dose of 100 rem or 200 rem is immaterial;
the disease is going to run the same serious course.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#70:1>
All that one can say is that the probability of getting leukaemia
from an exposure of 100 rem is less than that from an exposure to 200 rem.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#71:1>
It is worth noting that even in the case of chemicals we should
legitimately make this distinction between stochastic and
non-stochastic effects, but this is not explicitly done. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#72:1>
<h> <bold> Aim of radiation protection </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#73:1>
The aim of radiation protection is to prevent non-stochastic
effects and to limit the probability of stochastic effects to levels deemed
to be acceptable.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#74:1>
Non-stochastic effects can be prevented by setting the dose limits at
sufficiently low values so that the threshold dose would not be reached, even
following exposure for the whole of a lifetime ( for members of the
public ) or for the total period of working life ( in the case of
occupational exposure ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#75:1>
The limitation of stochastic effects is dealt with later. ) ICRP
publication 26, brought out in 1977, is an epoch-making document.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#76:1>
( It is likely to undergo a major revision in 1990. )

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#77:1>
It recommends a system of protection whose philosophy and
methodologies have profound implications in all areas of risk management (
<mention> ICRP </mention> , 1977a ) . </p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#78:1>
<h> <bold> System of dose limitation </bold> </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#79:1>
This has 3 components, namely <mention> Justification </mention> ,
<mention> Optimisation </mention> , and <mention> Dose limitation
</mention> .

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#80:1>
<h> Justification : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#81:1>
No practice shall be adopted unless its introduction produces a
positive net benefit.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#82:1>
( This implies a cost-benefit analysis. ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#83:1>
<h> Optimisation ( ALARA ) : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#84:1>
All exposures shall be kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic
and social factors being taken into account.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#85:1>
This is the famous ALARA principle.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#86:1>
( It implies a differential cost-benefit analysis. ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#87:1>
<h> Dose limitation : </h>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#88:1>
Doses to individuals shall not exceed the prescribed limits.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#89:1>
( This is the overriding clause.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#90:1>
It is intended to ensure that the risk to any individual does not
exceed acceptable limits, even if the practice might have been justified.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#91:1>
<mention> ALARA has </mention> to be applied subject to this
limitation on individual dose ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#92:1>
The concepts of justification and Optimisation have been
elaborately developed by </w> <mention> ICRP </mention> and guidelines have
been provided for applying them in a variety of practical cases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#93:1>
A parameter used for optimisation is the collective dose, which is
the product of the number of persons exposed in a group multiplied by the
average dose to this group.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#94:1>
It is a measure of the total health detriment to the population as a
whole and of the burden on society that this detriment will impose ( say,
in terms of hospitalisation facilities or economic expenditure ) .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#95:1>
This parameter is of applicability to chemical pollutants as well.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#96:1>
<h> <bold> Categories of exposure </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#97:1>
<mention> ICRP </mention> distinguishes between controllable and
non-controllable exposures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#98:1>
In the former case, the occurrence of the exposure is foreseen and
can be limited by control of the source and development of satisfactory
operating procedures.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#99:1>
ln the case of uncontrollable exposures ( as in the case of
accidents ) , the exposure is not subject to control, so that subsequent
exposure can be limited, if at all, only by remedial action.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#100:1>
Since remedial action itself ( for example evacuation, denial of
certain areas or contaminated foodstuffs for a time period ) may interfere
severely with normal activities, impose a social or economic burden, and in
certain cases pose its own hazards, the type of remedial action should be
planned on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. ( Paractical guidelines for
specific situations are given by <mention> ICRP </mention> . ) </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2A-033#101:1>
<mention> ICRP </mention> has developed to a high degree of
sophistication probabilistic risk assessment methodologies.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#102:1>
Other institutions in the nuclear field have also devoted
considerable attention to risk assessment; as an important example may be
mentioned the <mention> Event-Tree </mention> and <mention> Fault-Tree
Analysis </mention> extensively developed for assessment of reactor safety in
the monumental <O> <&> page </&> 885 </O> monograph brought out in 1976 in
USA and usually referred to as the <mention> Rasmussen Report </mention> or
<mention> WASH-1400 </mention> .

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#103:1>
<mention> ICRP </mention> also makes a distinction between
occupational exposure and exposure of a member of the public.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#104:1>
The former is characterised by involving a small number of persons,
who will be adults above the age of 18, with a knowledge of radiation hazards
and protective measures, taking up the occupation willingly, and under strict
health physics and medical surveillance.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#105:1>
On the other hand, the members of the public comprise a much larger
population, including radiosensitive groups like children and pregnant
women and women of reproductive capacity, not capable of strict supervision,
and generally not benefiting from the radiation exposure.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#106:1>
Hence different dose limits are prescribed in the two cases.

<ICE-IND:W2A-033#107:1>
It is obvious that such a distinction applies in the case of
chemical pollutants as well. </p> </I>
