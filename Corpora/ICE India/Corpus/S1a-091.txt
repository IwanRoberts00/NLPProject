just getting to know things

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#199:1:B>
Yeah <indig> haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#200:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#202:1:B>
Yeah yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#203:1:C>
I was <,> made to believe <{> <[> she would be </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#204:1:B>
<[> Worry <,> oh or </[> </{> worried <,> okay

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#205:1:C>
Uhn <,> well uh <,> <{> <[> everything was fine </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#206:1:B>
<[> I think </[> </{> I think she is not bad <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#207:1:C>
No <,> anyway I don't have to work with her

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#208:1:B>
I know

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#209:1:C>
I will be in other group

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#210:1:B>
I know

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#211:1:C>
But even then she didn't seem to be one of those <,> <O> one
word </O> though she has lot of weight to throw around <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#212:1:B>
No doubt no doubt <,> I mean <{> <[> may be </[> she has

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#213:1:C>
<[> She is </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#214:1:C>
She is physically very fat <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#215:1:B>
<O> Laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#216:1:B>
I see <,> is it

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#217:1:C>
No you haven't seen her <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#218:1:B>
I have seen her but <w> I've </w> <{> <[> normally may have
<,> may have put on </[> some more weight in the meanwhile

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#219:1:C>
<[> Oh she is quiet bulky yeah </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#220:1:C>
No no no <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#221:1:B>
Because it is almost two years since I saw her <{> <[> three
</[> or two or three years

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#222:1:C>
<[> Three </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#223:1:C>
Ahn <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#224:1:B>
Because I <,> I am one of those unfortunate people <,> <{>
<[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> who have been responsible for uh awarding Ph D
to <O> laughs </O> <{> <[> so many </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#225:1:C>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#226:1:C>
<[> Ahn </[> </{> I see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#227:1:B>
Actually I looked into her thesis also

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#228:1:C>
Oh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#229:1:B>
And that must have been three years ago

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#230:1:C>
<indig> Haan </indig> because <{> <[> I see </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#231:1:B>
<[> And I had </[> </{> gone

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#232:1:C>
I felt a lot of consolation <,> looking at her size

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#233:1:B>
<O> laughs </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#234:1:B>
Come on

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#235:1:C>
And so she has a lot of weight to throw around and she did
<,> <O> laughter </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#236:1:C>
She was <,> good <,> <{> <[> ah <,> and then <,> uh I see some
passages were rejected

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#237:1:B>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#238:1:B>
Ahn <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#239:1:C>
And <{> <[> then </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#240:1:B>
<[> From </[> </{> the ones which we had already taken

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#241:1:C>
Yes yes <,> and then <{> <[> some in some cases </[> <,>
Kadepurkar you know see another thing is he is conducting the whole procedure
in Marathi <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#242:1:B>
<[> Oh how unfortunate </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#243:1:B>
Oh God <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#244:1:C>
Not being audible to half the audience <,> <{> <[> oh <,> it
was not it was a messy affair

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#245:1:B>
<[> Oh </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#246:1:B>
Oh I see

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#247:1:C>
So I was telling

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#248:1:B>
And wasn't Gokhale there <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#249:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#250:1:B>
Ah ha

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#251:1:C>
But he did a good job <,> whatever you had <{> <[> assigned
to him </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#252:1:B>
<[> I think <,> yeah </[> </{> I think he is

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#253:1:C>
We had a session of passages <,> and he had look through

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#254:1:B>
Ah ha

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#255:1:C>

West <,> dictionary has come

<[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> with some more material

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#266:1:B>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#267:1:B>
Alright

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#268:1:C>
And then I told Kadepurkar look <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#269:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#270:1:C>
We are not going to look at the material <O> one word </O>
endlessly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#271:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#272:1:C>
Now you make a final selection and we will start working

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#273:1:B>
No no I think that snag is <,> somewhat there

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#274:1:C>
<indig> Haan </indig> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#275:1:B>
That you know I have I have diagnosed the case but I have got
to <,> <,> <{> <[> <indig> haan </indig> <,> do that unfortunately no <,> <{>
<[> job of </[> <,> coordinating <,> in the sense that people pulling in
different direction <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#276:1:C>
<[> <indig> Haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#277:1:C>
<[> <indig> Haan <,> haan </indig> </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#278:1:C>
It looks like <O> one word </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#279:1:B>
Like you know the Board people <,> <{> <[> ahn <,> want to
assert their whatever <,,> you know

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#280:1:C>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#281:1:C>
It looked like it and <{> <[> they </[> are not able to
select

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#282:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#283:1:B>
No no they want to assert there right alright <,> but then uh
<,> I mean <,,> I not all not many of them were really academically <,,> uh
capable of <,,> you know <,> isn't it ?

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#284:1:C>
Yeah

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#285:1:B>
I don't know really

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#286:1:C>
Yeah <w> it's </w> all the you see uh <,,> uh what you call
<,> <O> one word </O> was not very wrong

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#287:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#288:1:C>
But the way she went about was wrong <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#289:1:B>
<w> That's </w> right

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#290:1:C>
Anyway <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> the <{> <[> point </[> yes uh <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#291:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#292:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#293:1:B>
But then we have to <,> somehow manage the show <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#294:1:C>
Exactly

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#295:1:B>
So I I <,> maybe you know <,> atleast in my presence <,,>
they somehow seem to <,> agree to many of the things that I <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#296:1:C>
You know <O> one word </O> it looks like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-091#297:1:C>
This time people were opposing <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#298:1:B>
I know <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#299:1:C>
And uh <,> my <,> group is not so bad

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#300:1:B>
Yeah <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#301:1:C>
Except that Lalita Ghatge everytime she brought a piece <,>
<{> <[> uhn <,> it was <O> one word </O> down to L three <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#302:1:B>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#303:1:B>
Oh really

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#304:1:C>
But she said why don't you all <O> one word </O> include me
in L three istead of doing this <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#305:1:B>
<indig> Haan </indig>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#306:1:C>
I am doing other peoples work <,> <{> <[> ahn <,> she was
annoyed

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#307:1:B>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#308:1:B>
Actually <,> that may be a good really because the <,> small
<O> one word </O> you know <,> <{> <[> ahn <,> and if she can really <,> be
of use to L three <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#309:1:C>
<[> Ahn </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#310:1:C>
But it doesn't <O> two words </O> material production I don't
know <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#311:1:B>
Yeah what she is capable of

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#312:1:C>
Ah yes <,> but you know the whole problem is <,> except
Wakankar in that group <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> nobody else really knows the job

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#313:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#314:1:B>
I know <,> I know <,>

<$C>

<indig> Ahn </indig> <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-091#319:1:C>
Uh <,> in our case <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> we have something
