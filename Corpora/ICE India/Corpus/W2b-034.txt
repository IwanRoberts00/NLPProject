<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> colour photocopying
machine incorporates several technologies - - photostatic laser, colour
separation, computer and dye chemistry, apart from other electronic,
electrical and mechanical devices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#6:1>
In black-and-white photocopying machines, the light reflected from
the document falls on a charged selenium drum and dissipates the charges
selectively in the white areas as distinct from the dark written or printed
matter of the original document.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#7:1>
Then the oppositely charged particles of toner ink adhere to the
charged areas on the drum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#8:1>
In the next cycle, the ink is lifted on to paper to give a copy which
is like the original document. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#9:1>
In laser photocopiers, a narrow laser beam is guided by a computer
to selectively dissipate the charges on the drum of the photocopier machine.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#10:1>
The process used in colour copying differs drastically from that
used in colour photography.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#11:1>
The dyes used in colour photography are not photosensitive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#12:1>
Therefore, along with the dyes, reactive chemicals which act as
agents between the light and the dyes are coated on to the films and papers
on which the prints are to be made.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#13:1>
These chemicals carry the dyes to appropriate <O> <&> page </&> 66 </O> 
points on the image when the colour films and papers are
developed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#14:1>
Once this is done, the dye image is stabilized by removing the
carriers and couplers in the agents. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#15:1>
In contrast, the plain papers used in colour copying are neither
coated with coloured dyes nor with reactive chemicals.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#16:1>
Therefore, colour reproduction by the photocopier process
involves, pigment application as in water-colour painting.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#17:1>
When many water colours are applied successively in an overlay, the
painted area appears black ( see box ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#18:1>
However, the chemistry of the dyes used in colour photocopying
in such that they do not react with each other when applied in overlay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#19:1>
They are also spectrally transparent which permits them to show
intermediate shades when overlayed by the dyes of other colours. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#20:1>
As distinct from colour printing, the colour separation technique
used in colour photocopying consists of two separate steps.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#21:1>
First, the original colour transparency, photograph or painting is
photographed onto three black-and-white films.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#22:1>
Each film is shot thriough a filter of one primary colour ( cyan,
magenta and yellow ) under identical geometrical conditions, to give three
negatives of three subtractive primary colours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#23:1>
These three negatives are then successively exposed through the same
filters onto the printing paper to give the natural colour photograph. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#24:1>
In the black-and-white photocopier machine for reasons of space,
the original document is scanned insuccessive sections by a moving
mirror.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#25:1>
These sections are relfected onto a sensitized selenium drum. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#26:1>
<h> <bold> Computerized scanning </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#27:1>
In a colour laser photocopying machine, the image of the original
colour document, photograph or transparency is first captured
electro-nically in each of the three primary colours in the same
brightness level.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#28:1>
Electronic capture does not record the complete image as is done in
photography, but breaks it into a number of pixels ( individual picture
elements ) in a process which is called <quote> ` bit mapping' </quote> .
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#29:1>
The process occurs as follows: In the colour photocopier machine,
scaning is done by a strip-line of charge coupled devices ( CCDS ) which
are similar to tiny photocells.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#30:1>
These are arranged so that there are 16 CCDS per millimetre of
1,728 to cover the width of an A-4 paper, a total of 5,000 in three groups,
one each in red, blue and green.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#31:1>
Every <O> drawing at the bginning of column two </O> <O> caption </O>
CCD in the scanner or reader unit of the colour laser photocopier machine
generates electrical voltages depending on the incident light, say 1 V
when the brightest light falls on it and 0 V when no light falls on it.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#32:1>
In other words, the voltages generated by the CCDS can be in the
states <quote> ` ON' </quote> or <quote> 'OFF' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#33:1>
This is the binary code for feeding information into the computer.
</p>

<p> <h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#34:1>
How does the computer see the original document or picture ? </h>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#35:1>
The compu-ter registers 1 V as one bit of information.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#36:1>
Two bits can count from 0 to 3, three bits from 0 to 7, four bits
from 0 to 15, five bits from 0 to 31, six bits from 0 to 63, seven bits from
0 to 127, eight bits from 0 to 225 and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#37:1>
Now an original document or photograph will contain an enormous
number of microscopic parts picked up by the CCDS.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#38:1>
Each part represents a pixel ( picture element). </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#39:1>
These pixels, some several million of them, have to be entered in
the form of bits into the memory of a computer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#40:1>
To accommodate the enormous number of bits into the built-in memory
of a computer, the memory is given in kilobytes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#41:1>
A kilobyte is 1,024 bytes, that is, two raised to ten. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#42:1>
Any black-and-white document or photograph can be looked at from
the point of view of shades of grey which are represented within eight
clearly defined levels.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#43:1>
These eight levels are sufficient to take care of all the shades of
grey.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#44:1>
The light picked up from each pixel is given a value by an eight-bit
digitizer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#45:1>
The position of each pixel in the document or photograph is fixed by
horizontal ( x) and vertical ( y) coordinates, each of which can be
addressed by the computer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#46:1>
The resolution of the copying machine affects the quality of
photographs reproduced.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#47:1>
So, in the case of the photocopier, it is the number of pixels which
build the document or photograph.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#48:1>
The greater the number and the smaller the size of the pixels, the
higher the resolution of the copy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#49:1>
For coloured documents or photographs, eight levels of shades
are not enough, each of the primary subtractive colours require 32 shades
at the minimum level of acceptability.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#50:1>
Consequently, the pixel count increases enormously. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#51:1>
The information recorded after the electronic capture of the
original colour document, photograph or transparency is digitized and
the pixels are stored in the <w> computer's </w> memory.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#52:1>
The computer can now be made to drive a laser and transfer the pixels
through filters ( of three primary colours and black, for brightness levels,
onto a photosensitive drum in quick succession - - a process remotely
resembling pigment deposition in watercolour painting. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#53:1>
<h> <bold> Colour laser photocopier </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#54:1>
The machine has two distinct components: a scanner with a
computer and a printer.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#55:1>
The original colour document is lit by high actinic lights, its
image is reflected by a mirror onto a strip of CCDS arranged in three groups
<O> column two and three below, three drawings </O> <O> captions below each
</O> <O> <&> page </&> 67 </O> behind the filters of each of the primary
subtractive colours ( red, blue and green ) . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#56:1>
The electronic signals picked up by the CCDS are sent to the
printer unit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#57:1>
Here the drum is first charged electrically to make it uniformly
photosensitive and then the electronic signals from the CCDS and computer
are made to activate the build-in laser.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#58:1>
The laser is turned on and off depending upon the electronic signal
from the CCD.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#59:1>
When operated on, the laser strikes the photo-charged drum and
neutralizes the charges in selected areas of the image, corresponding to the
colour of the original.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#60:1>
The regions of the drum not hit by the laser retain their electric
charges. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#61:1>
The remaining electric charges attract the toner of that primary
colour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#62:1>
This cycle of wiping the charged drum by the laser and depositing the
toner on it is repeated for the other two primary colours and for black. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#63:1>
The toner of the three primary colours and black are lifted
from the drum to the plain paper and fused there in a stabilization process.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#64:1>
At every stage, before the laser strikes the charged drum, the
computer which drives the laser can be issued selective commands.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#65:1>
These commands can involve changing the colours, or editing parts
from its bit map.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#66:1>
Every pixel can be addressed through the computer which can also be
set to automatically monitor colour selecting, brightness and density so as
to correspond with the original. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#67:1>
Other built-in facilities may include reduction and enlargement
capacities limited to the maximum size of paper or the length of the drum.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#68:1>
Using the editing facility of the computer, a picture from one
location can be shifted to another point on the same sheet or to another
sheet, or its dimensions can be altered, as its bit map can be extended
vertically or horizontally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#69:1>
Also, reduction or magnification only in one direction is
possible.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#70:1>
A slide attachment permits enlarged plain paper prints in colour.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#71:1>
Using the editing facility of the computer, a picture from one
location can be shifted to another point on the same sheet or to another
sheet, or its dimensions can be altered, as its bit map can be extended
vertically or horizontally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#72:1>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#73:1>
A slide attachment permits enlarged plain paper prints in colour.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#74:1>
False colour copies can be made by altering the signals to the
printer as well as by making a negative colour print from a positive of the
coloured original.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#75:1>
The colour laser photocopier is likely to pose a threat to
conventional colour photography because of its speed and economic
viability. </p> <*> logo </*> </I>

<bold> REPRODUCTION OF COLOUR <&> centered </&> IN PHOTOGRAPHY
</bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#77:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> <w> Sun's </w> surface
temperature is over 6,000<sp>o</sp> C and its light energy reaches us as a
bundle of long and short wavelengths varying according to the state of
atmosphere, presence of clouds, etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#78:2>
Thus the standard temperature of daylight varies from place to place.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#79:2>
In India, it is over 7,000 K while in USA it is about 6,500 K and in
England about 5,200 K.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#80:2>
Under overcast conditions, the longer, less energetic wavelengths
are stopped and the light reaching the <w> Earth's </w> surface has a higher
ratio of shorter, bluer wavelengths, so its colour temperature may rise to
between 8,000 to 9,000 K.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#81:2>
Towards evening, sunlight becomes yellower and finally orange or red
at sunset, for the lower the sun sinks, the greater the atmospheric haze
which stops shorter wavelengths, increasing the proportion of longer
wavelengths, and so the colour temperature drops.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#82:2>
Thus, the colour temperature of sunlight varies considerably. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#83:2>
Wavelength determines a colour - - when all the colours in the
spectrum are present <quote> ` white' </quote> light is formed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#84:2>
Photographically speaking, colour temperature tells how white the
light from the Sun or an artificial source is.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#85:2>
When it contains mainly short wave-lengths, it will be blue-white,
whereas when it contains mainly long wavelengths it will be yellow-white.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#86:2>
Colour temperature of a light is compared with a black body heated to
emit light of similar balance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#87:2>
The temperature necessary for the black body to reach this light
intensity is known as the equivalent colour temperature and is second in
importance to exposure in colour reproduction. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#88:2>
<h> <bold> Colour objects </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#89:2>
Light sources such as the Sun, stars, electric, gas and oil
lights, candles, flash bulbs and electronic flash units are bodies which
radiate ( electromagnetic ) light waves.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#90:2>
Other objects are visible because they reflect light waves from light
sources.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#91:2>
Black objects appear so because they can absorb all the light falling
on them ( incident light ) and reflect none.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#92:2>
White objects are white because they reflect all wavelengths of
light, so white light is reflected as white.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#93:2>
If a white object is taken into red light it will appear red, under
green light it will appear green and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#94:2>
The colour we attribute to objects is that which they appear to be in
white light. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#95:2>
Between black which absorbs all light and white which reflects
all light are every colour and shade of the spectrum.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#96:2>
Every substance has its own particular wavelength absorption and
reflectance construction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#97:2>
Absorption and reflection characteristics are affected by adding dyes
to some substances thus changing their colour.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#98:2>
The silver salts in films are by nature only sensitive to a narrow
band of wavelengths; to make a film sensitive to all visible colours (
panchromatic ) , dyes are added to allow it to absorb these other colours and
thus record them. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#99:2>
<h> <bold> Complementary colours </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#100:2>
Light of complementary colours when mixed, produce white light.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#101:2>
For instance, white light can be produced by the following
permutations and combinations: Red + blue-green = white Orange + blue = white
Yellow + violet = white Green + purple = white </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#102:2>
To an artist, the primary colours are red, blue and yellow, but
in photography, another set of primaries are used which are respectively
complementary to the <w> artist's </w> primaries.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#103:2>
Modern photographic materials are sensitized to what are termed as
additive primaries.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#104:2>
In this system, the complementaries are bluegreen, magenta and
yellow.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#105:2>
These are termed substractive primaries and are the colours of
the dyes used in the three layers of a positive colour print or transparency,
the final colours in the picture being formed by subtraction of colour
from white light. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#106:2>
<h> <bold> Colour print paper </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-034#107:2>
Photosensitive printing paper is prepared using three
emulsion layers with a colour sensitivity similar to that of the exposed
film.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#108:2>
The colour negative is placed in the enlarger, a white light is
shone through it, then by using suitable colour filters, a record can be made
of the original colour subject or each layer can be exposed in turn using
filters which cut out all wavelengths except those to which each layer is
sensitive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#109:2>
Dyes used in the final image contain the subtractive colours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#110:2>
Since printing is done on a white base paper, it is essential to use
subtractive colours.

<ICE-IND:W2B-034#111:2>
Thus, white is represented by cleared unexposed emulsion in the
three layers allowing the paper base to show through the white. </p> <&>
