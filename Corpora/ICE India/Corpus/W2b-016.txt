<smallcaps> CASTE</smallcaps> has always cast a long shadow
over Indian politics and the spectre that haunts the country is not that of
class struggle but of caste struggle.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#5:1>
<quote> " Backwards" </quote> and <quote> " Forwards" </quote> have
become more meaningful today than Left and Right in politics, and some are
playing as <quote> " Centre-forward" </quote> against reservation, stoking
the fire and threatening the redivision of society. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#6:1>
The banks of both the Sabarmati and the Jamuna, carrying
memories of Gandhi and Nehru, are in flames, and with legislation to
extend reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for 10 more
years, the flame is spreading everywhere since increasing unemployment and
declining job opportunities are becoming central factors.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#7:1>
Though there is more noise in the north, the importance of caste
was more pointedly recognized in the south where in 1885, strangely
coinciding with the birth of the Indian National Congress, the then
Government of Madras brought in the Grant in Aid code to provide special
educational facilities to certain sections. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#8:1>
<bold> CASTE FACTOR </bold>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#9:1>
At the all-India level, the Montague Chelmsford reforms
recognized the caste factor and recommended some welfare measures for
certain depressed classes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#10:1>
The 1935 Act later developed these into reservation for the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#11:1>
After Independence more castes staked their claims for special
facilities and the term Other Backward Class came into existance. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#12:1>
Though the recent legislation relates only to extending special
quotas in Parliament and the Assemblies for 10 more years, the whole issue
has been raked up by the anti-reservation agitation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#13:1>
It may be noted that though there is increased demand for
reservation for the OBCs and for implementation of the recommendations
of the Mandal Commission, even the original provision for such
reservation is being challenged in the streets. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#14:1>
Caste divisions within society are reflected in the Constitution
as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#15:1>
Though Articles 14, 15, 16 and 29 guarantee equal rights to all
citizens and forbid any discrimination on the basis of caste, religion,
language and sex, special provisions were made for certain castes by
adding clause ( 4) both to Article 16 for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and
to Article 15 for the OBC.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#16:1>
Since then Article 15(4) and 16(4) along with Article 45 of the
Directive Principles, have become a charter of rights for the downtrodden.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#17:1>
The question of caste also kept the Supreme Court of India busy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#18:1>
It was argued that clause ( 4) of Articles 15 and 16 had made the
parent Articles meaningless and that special facilities should have no place
in a modern democratic society.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#19:1>
However, for the stark reality within society and also for the fact
that survival of the fittest is the law of the jungle, the Supreme Court had
to alter its earlier judgement in the case of Balaji vs State of Mysore (
1963) which did not recognize caste but maintained, <quote> " social
backwardness is in ultimate analysis the result of poverty to a very large
extent" </quote> to lay down in 1965 in P. Rajendran vs State of Madras (
1965) that <quote> " A caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as
a whole is socially and educationally backward, reservation can be made in
favour of such caste within the meaning of Article 15(4)." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#20:1>
All political parties, whether backward or forward, face the same
awkward situation in dealing with caste questions and cannot take a
clear-cut stand without jeopardizing votes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#21:1>
The Centre has already abdicated its responsibility after two
exercises with the backward caste in the Kaka Kalelkar and Mandal
Commissions, with a gap of 25 years between them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#22:1>
Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, U.P.,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab are landed
with 15 commissions dealing with castes, other than the Scheduled Castes, and
Tribes and their entitlements, suggesting a mysterious quantum of
facilities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#23:1>
However, the question that baffles all is why it is that social
divisions are becoming sharper and sharper and more and more antagonistic day
by day so that violence in the name of caste has become more frequent after
Independence than before.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#24:1>
What is more, in the name of the discovery of India, there is a
discovery of castes so that while the Kaka Kalelkar Commission ( 1955)
mentioned 2,399 castes ( 839 being <quote> " most backward" </quote> ) ,
instead of decreasing the number in creased to nearly 4,000 by the time of
the Mandal Commission in 1980. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#25:1>
Why is the clock moving anticlockwise?

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#26:1>
In the original Constitution the provision of reservation was
made for 10 years and Dr. Ambedkar expressed the hope that this would be
sufficient for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes to shake off their
historical backwardness and be at part with the rest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#27:1>
But the reality remained different.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#28:1>
It is certain that reservations will be with us even in the 21st
century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#29:1>
The former Chief Justice of India, Mr. Chandrachud, has opined
that reservation should continue for 50 years more!

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#30:1>
So what are the factors which make castes more and more relevant in
our body politic?

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#31:1>
Where does the defect in our democratic process lie? </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#32:1>
The reason is simple.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#33:1>
This is because of the exploitative capitalist system we are creating
in the name of nation-bulding.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#34:1>
The caste system not only indicates divisions within society but
also discrimination and disparity, and our so-called democratic
process, because of its exploitative nature, instead of decreasing,
accentuates the elements of discrimination and disparity within
society, resurrecting with even greater vigour old problems in new form.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#35:1>
While the Press and the elite give an impression that there has
been enough of reservation and now it should end, statistics give a different
picture. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#36:1>
According to the Mandal Commission, the combined share of the
Scheduled Castes and Tribes in the class I and class II services of the
Central Government was 5.68 per cent and 18.18 per cent while that of the
backward classes was 4.69 per cent and 10.63 per cent, though the two groups
combined constitute more than 70 per cent of the population.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#37:1>
Out of the total of 49 class I officers in the secretariat of the
President only four were from the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and none from
the OBC.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#38:1>
In the Prime <w> Minister's </w> Secretariat only two out of 35
class I officers belonged to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and none to the
OBC.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#39:1>
Among class II officers the number was slightly higher, but much
below the reserved quota. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#40:1>
<h> <bold> HOME MINISTRY </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#41:1>
What is interesting is that the Home Ministry, which is supposed
to enforce reservation throughout the country, could not maintain reservation
in its own secretariat.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#42:1>
In British India between 1882 and 1904 out of 16 ICS officers 15 were
Brahmins.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#43:1>
In 1914 out of 118 <indig> munsifs </indig> , 93 were Brahmins, and
in 1944 out of 650 graduates 452 came from the same caste.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#44:1>
Only 10 Scheduled Castes and Tribes candidates could qualify on merit
in the IAS and six in the IPS, between 1969 and 1978, there being none in
1976 and 1977.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#45:1>
The proponents of meritocracy cannot explain how all the merit in
the country became hereditary within a small sect. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#46:1>
The problem is even more challenging beyond the world of
government officers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#47:1>
In answer to questions in Parliament, the Government revealed that
the literacy percentages of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes in 1961, 1971 and
1981 were 10.11 and 8.06, 14.54 and 10.89, and 21.38 and 16.35 respectively.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#48:1>
The literacy percentages for the general public in those same
years were 23.93, 29.48 and 36.23 i.e. the gap remained the same.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#49:1>
The picture is still more dismal for females.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#50:1>
What is more, there is only a marginal difference in States like West
Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, whether ruled by the Congress or Janata or the
Left.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#51:1>
So that malady is connected with the nature of the system and not
the character of the government. </p> <&> centred </&>

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#52:1>
<h> <bold> POVERTY LINE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#53:1>
The economic picture is even more depressing.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#54:1>
In 1977-78 the percentage of population below the poverty line in
rural and urban areas was 57.82 and 44.98 in Bihar, 67.89 and 41.8 in
Orissa, 58.31 and 34.5 in West Bengal and 57.2 and 38.4 at the all-India
level.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#55:1>
The same percentage for the Scheduled Castes was 77.75 and 63.88 in
Bihar, 80.05 and 71.63 in Orissa, 70.75 and 54.50 in West Bengal, and 64.64
and 54.25 at the all-India level, and for the Scheduled Tribes 68.20 and
51.40 in Bihar, 86.38 and 70.90 in Orissa, 75.42 and 56.64 in West
Bengal and 72.93 and 52.59 nationally. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#56:1>
In 1983-84 - - the latest year for which figures are available -
- the percentage below the poverty line in rural and urban areas in general
were 51.35 and 37.04 in Bihar, 44.76 and 29.29 in Orissa, 43.84 and 26.52 in
West Bengal, and 40.4 and 18.1 nationally.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#57:1>
The percentage for the Scheduled Castes was 71.1 and 52.2 in Bihar,
54.9 and 40.3 in Orissa, 52.0 and 41.3 in West Bengal, and 53.1 and 40.4 at
the national level, and for the Scheduled Tribes, 64.9 and 39.8 in Bihar,
60.9 and 52.0 in Orissa, 58.6 and 33.1 in West Bengal and 58.4 and 39.9
nationally. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#58:1>
At this rate it will take the entire 21st century to wipe out
the percentage of the population below the poverty line and even longer to
bridge the gap between the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the general
population so that a homogeneous Indian society in economic terms can
emerge. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#59:1>
The argument of the upper castes that reservation diminishes
efficiency is bogus as in that case <w> Bihar's </w> administration would
have been more efficient than that in Tamil Nadu.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#60:1>
In an underdeveloped country like India motivation is more
important than <quote> " merit" </quote> , and the motivation to serve and
work is for more evident in the lower castes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#61:1>
Whether in the corridors of <w> Writers' </w> Buildings in
Calcutta or in the Gujarat Secretariat, 100 per cent of the loiterers during
working hours belong to the upper castes which also claim <quote> " merit"
</quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#62:1>
But this does not mean that all is well with the present
reservation policy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#63:1>
There is substance in the argument that reservations and special
facilities have been monopolized by the few amongst the eligible groups
creating a class of neo-Brahmins within the Dalits.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#64:1>
They are worse than traditional Brahmins regarding their attitude
to physical work and towards other Dalits.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#65:1>
But this is not because weightage has been given to the caste factor,
but because of the acquisitive values created by capitalism which has made
even the provisions of the MRTP Acts useless in the economic sphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-016#66:1>
Reservation is nothing but a restriction on social monopoly and
its misuse can easily be restricted, if not eliminated, by reserving
these facilities for one generation so that those who enjoy reservation
once should be considered <quote> " forward" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#67:1>
This would make special facilities available to other members of
the same Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and strike at the very root of the new
monopoly.

<ICE-IND:W2B-016#68:1>
But all these modifications can be contemplated only after the
original provisions of reservation are honestly implemented, and a movement
is launched for a long-awaited social resolution to end the existing
exploitative system of which social discrimination is a part. </p> <*>
