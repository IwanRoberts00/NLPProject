In today's programme <,> we bring you a talk <,> on <,,> the British  
policy towards the tribes of north east India <,> in the nineteenth century  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#X2:1>
The talker <,> is Dr Anwar Hussein <,> lecturer in the department of  
History <,> Dibrugarh University <,,> </X> </&> 

<$A>

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#3:1:A>
After the first Anglo-Burmese war <,> of eighteen twenty-four  
<,> twenty-six <,,> the British established themselves <,> in the valley of  
the Brahmaputra <,,> expelling the Burmese from the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#4:1:A>
Then they now <,> face the new problem <,,> the problem of the hill  
tribes <,> in the north east frontier <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#5:1:A>
So the reason to formulate a policy which was not <,> a static one  
<,> but it had to be geared up <,> to beat the exigencies in the frontiers  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#6:1:A>
The aim and object <,> of the policy <,> was to control the tribal  
areas <,,> for the excercise of limited administrative authority <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#7:1:A>
The political aspect of the policy <,> and all states <,,> was to  
use the tribes <,> on the eastern fringes <,> as a screen between the newly  
acquired territories <,> and the kingdom of Burma <,> was initiated <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#8:1:A>
With a view to using the <w> Sinko's </w> tracks <,,> as a screen  
<,> east of armies <,,> treaties were signed between Sinko chiefs and the  
company chiefs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#9:1:A>
The Mamoir tracks <,> were also kept separate <,,> from the upper  
Assam principality of Purander Sinha <,,> who was <,> enthroned <,> in  
eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule <,> till eighteen thirty-eight <,>  
for securing ready supply of provisions for British troops <,> passing  
through the region <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#10:1:A>
But exodia and <?> jaitu </?> <,> contingence of British army <,>  
were deployed <,,> to observe <,> the <-> in what </-> activities <,,> of the  
frontiers <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#11:1:A>
The Austro mongoloid hill tribes <,> in north eastern India <,> on  
the other hand <,> had maintained <,> a potential isolation <,> for centuries  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#12:1:A>
The mountainous character of the territory <,> linguistic  
variations <,> inter-clan feud <,> and inter-tribal warfare <,,> had  
prevented political union <,> among the hillman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#13:1:A>
While <,> the superstitious customs <,> of head hunting <,> and  
sorcery <,> practised by some of the tribes <,> engendered <-> that </-> <,,>  
a policy of indifference <,> on the part of <,> the neighbouring rulers <,>  
in the plains <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#14:1:A>
The hills were clotted with dense forests <,> and bordered by  
patches of hollows <,> and swamps <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#15:1:A>
The physiographic conditions <,> rendered <,> inter-communications  
<,,> almost impossible <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#16:1:A>
And while the climate was extremely innovating <,> and the people  
of the hill areas <,> had to live <,> in seclusion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#17:1:A>
So the tribes except towards the west <,> outside the western  
boundary of Bhutan <,> there was no organised kingdom <,,> hence <,> they  
were not capable of resisting the British arms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#18:1:A>
Beginning with the Bhutias <,> of Bhutan <,,> a series of  
engagement <,,> enter with the tribes <,> by which <,,> they undertook to  
surrender <,> their rights <,> in these territories <,> for a consideration  
of regular payment of compensation <,> by the <w> Company's </w> government  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#19:1:A>
But the government in return <,> intended not to interfere <,> in  
the internal affairs <,,> what were left alone <,> in the hills <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#20:1:A>
In primitive times <,> the payment of compensation <,,> in the form  
of <indig> pasa </indig> <,> or assignment of <,> a part of revenue <,> was a  
system <,> interlift by Ahom <,> to reoncile <,> the hill tribes <,> on the  
frontiers of the kingdom <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#21:1:A>
But British made a substantial change in the system <,,> which was  
existed during the Ahom time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#22:1:A>
It stopped <,> a direct collection of the dues <,> by the tribes  
<,> themselves <,,> from the <indig> rayats </indig> <,> because it led  
sometimes to quarrels <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#23:1:A>
Instead of <,> it begin to pay them some cash <,> which was known  
as black mail <,> and it was collected <,> at the same time <,> through dues  
from the <indig> rayats </indig> <,,> who were exempted <,> from payment of  
dues to the tribesman <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#24:1:A>
This system actually <,> cut off the direct link between the  
<indig> rayat </indig> and the tribes <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#25:1:A>
To begin with <,,> the attitude of the tribes <,> towards the  
British government <,> did not seem to be hostile <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#26:1:A>
The Kamtis <,> and Shintos <,> accepted the British overtures of  
friendship <,> and their by British was successfully <-> the </-> entering  
<,> into sort of ties with them <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#27:1:A>
Abars was also friendly <,> till the middle of the century <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#28:1:A>
The Dafalas <,> and Aakals <,> agreed to accept <,> the money  
payment <,> in lieu of their right <,> to collect their <indig> pasa </indig>  
<,> in the due in the <?> doers </?> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#29:1:A>
But <,> after the consolidation of the British rule in Assam <,>  
the tribes became alive <,,> to the ensuing danger of the new system <,> and  
became restless <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#30:1:A>
Though the Kamtis revolted <,> with the assistance of Shintos <,>  
or <-> in </-> the pandal <,> was suppressed by the British arms <,> and  
divided the whole country areas <,> into four tracks <,> which was <,> under  
the direct control <,> of the government <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#31:1:A>
Like <,,> the Shintos <,> the Abars <,> the Aakal <,> the Dafalas  
<,> created problem <,> during the British regime <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#32:1:A>
The Nagas of the Tira district <,> continued to committ petty theft  
and loot <,> for a quiet long time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#33:1:A>
So the guzzling feast of rich <,> and other <,> tribals had to do  
<,,> due to their frustration <,> and poverty <,> in their economic and  
political reason <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#34:1:A>
So the British government <,> had gradually begun <,,> to  
substitute cash payment <,> in lieu of articles <,> and the money payment <,>  
which was fixed <,> with the then market price <,> remained fixed <,> all  
through the British period <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#35:1:A>
In order to solve the tribal problem <,> the British government <,>  
introduce certain policies <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#36:1:A>
For example <,,> number one <,> to set up out-post <,> along roads  
of the tribal movement <,> to set the encroach of the tribe <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#37:1:A>
Number two <,,> restrictions on plains people entering into hills  
for which <,,> the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three  
<,,> which restricted <,> the entrance of the plains <,> people <,> into the  
tribal hill areas <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#38:1:A>
And thus <,> minimised the contact <,,> between the hills <,> and  
the plains <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#39:1:A>
Number three <,> to <}> <-> popular </-> <+> popularise </+> </}>  
the <,> British manufactured products <,> in the tribal hill areas <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#40:1:A>
In popularising <,> the European products <,> <-> all good </-> <,>  
and promoting <,> their sale <,> they first had <,> vital importance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#41:1:A>
As a result <,> tribal products <,> mainly <,> raw materials <,>  
came down in the market <,> and European good <?> powered </?> <,> into the  
tribal territory etcetera <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#42:1:A>
Apart from this <,> it is <?> predict </?> if we see the character  
of the British policy <,,> then <w> we'll </w> find <,> that the hill areas  
in north eastern India <,,> enjoyed <,> a distinct feature <,> in the  
administrative map of British India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#43:1:A>
The system <,> innovated tended to serve <,> the colonial interest  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#44:1:A>
Anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier <,> with China and  
Burma <,> protection of villages <,> in the plains from tribal rage <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#45:1:A>
And exploitation of economic resources <,> of the hill <,> had  
prompted the British authorities to abandon <,> the earlier theory of non-  
intervention <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#46:1:A>
The traditional institution <,> were not disturbed <,> and the  
tribesman <,> were allowed to feel <,> that they were still governed by their  
hereditary chiefs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#47:1:A>
But the concept of a free man <,> was completely lost <,> and the  
chiefs were no better <,> than government servants <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#48:1:A>
The excluding regulation <,> created a gap <,> between the people  
of the hill <,> and the plains <,> and even in the hill areas <,> there were  
several administrative blocks <,> like <,> excluded area <,> and control area  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#49:1:A>
A series of the administrative borders <,> were created <,> in the  
region <,> and <,> stringent restrictions <,> were <,> imposed upon the  
outsiders in this area <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#50:1:A>
Tribal and non-tribal <,> were infused <,> as new social term <,>  
in Indian social structure <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#51:1:A>
The lost balance <,> of unrestricted trade <,> in the hill borders  
<,> and a process of social assimilation <,> <-> was </-> began in the  
foothills <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#52:1:A>
The <?> seat </?> is set back <,> due to the <,> segregrain <,,>  
policy of the British <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#53:1:A>
The other factor was education <,> which was left entirely <,> to  
western missionaries <,> who were invited by the government <,> to undertake  
<}> <-> post <.> le </.> </-> <=> <?> postalisation </?> </=> </}> and the  
schools <,> were supported <,> under <indig> gram </indig> scheme aid system  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#54:1:A>
In the beginning <,> Bengali was the medium of instruction <,> and  
tribal languages <,> were written <,> in Bengali script <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#55:1:A>
But subsequently <,,> English became the medium <,> and <,> Bengali  
script was replaced by Roman <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#56:1:A>
The integration of the hill people <,> with the rest of the country  
<,> would have been accomplished <,> as a natural process <,> but <,> the  
colonial attitude of the British <,> segregating regulations <,> and  
creations of the administrative artificial walls <,> create <,> a big vacuum  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#57:1:A>
Large number of hillman <,> converted into Christianity <,> but  
those who believed <,,> traditional religion and practices <,> the age old  
customs <,> were reformed as non Christians <,> as if they had no religion  
<,> to be mentioned <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#58:1:A>
There is no reason to accept <,> the western science of  
civilization <,> as in a <?> wastage </?> <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#59:1:A>
While some traditional <,,> customs <,> are highly scientific <,,>  
and <,> many in Indian situation <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-033#60:1:A>
So the aim of the British <,> was to safeguard their imperial <,>  
interest <,,> and try to justify <,,> the colonial control <,> by projecting  
<,> some wrong understanding <,> about the indigenous system of the hill  
people <,,> as backward <,,> unemployed <,> their own way of administration  
<,> in the hill areas of the north eastern region <,,> </I>
