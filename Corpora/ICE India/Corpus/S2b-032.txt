<ICE-IND:S2B-032#1:1:A>
To most of us the term <mention> map </mention> is quite  
familiar <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#2:1:A>
But still <,> we do not understand the exact meaning of a map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#3:1:A>
Perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys <,> or what a map is  
likely to present to us <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#4:1:A>
That shows there is a need <,> to define the term <,> <mention> map  
</mention> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#5:1:A>
<mention> Map </mention> is nothing but <,> representation of <,>  
the whole surface of the earth <,> or <,> part of the surface of the earth  
according to scale <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#6:1:A>
When I use the word whole surface of the earth I mean the world <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#7:1:A>
When I say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town <,> it  
can be a village <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#8:1:A>
Now when I use the word scale <,> the scale means that all the  
things that we find in the reality <,> cannot be transferred on a map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#9:1:A>
You have to represent <w> that's </w> found in the reality <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#10:1:A>
In other words that <,> one inch if you draw on a map <,> perhaps  
it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#11:1:A>
That shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#12:1:A>
Now <,> if one has to explain the concept of a map <,> let us take  
a very very simple example <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#13:1:A>
You are calling your friend home for a dinner <,> and you have  
given the address too <,> to him <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#14:1:A>
But he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#15:1:A>
After a few queries <,> perhaps you feel that your friend is not  
confident <,> to reach your home <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#16:1:A>
May be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few  
lines <,> clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located  
<,> <w> what's </w> a land mark <,> which is quite simple to identify <,> and  
how to reach your place <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#17:1:A>
Well <,> this sketch <,,> makes <,> the man more confident and he  
is able to get himself acquainted with your area <,> and he will be able to  
reach home confidently <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#18:1:A>
Now what does it mean <,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#19:1:A>
It means that <,> you have drawn a part of the city in a small  
sketch to convey the message to your friend <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#20:1:A>
I call this as the concept of map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#21:1:A>
Well <,,> if you agree that <,> any message can be transmitted in  
the form of a map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#22:1:A>
Now we would like to know how often we use <,> map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#23:1:A>
Well <,> how old is this concept <,,> ? 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#24:1:A>
You would like to know whether we came to know about maps <,> only  
recently <,> or it has a history behind <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#25:1:A>
I would like to say that the concept of map <,> <-> was </-> dates  
back to six hundred B C <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#26:1:A>
Greeks and Romans were the pioneers <,> to introduce the concept of  
map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#27:1:A>
Perhaps you would like to know that <,> in second century A D <,>  
it is Ptolemy <,> who brought <,> the concept of the map <,> for the whole  
world <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#28:1:A>
However <,> the accuracy <,> of the map <,> is not that encouraging  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#29:1:A>
Very rough <,> idea of the world was given <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#30:1:A>
But <,> very accurate map <,> dates back to sixteen seventy-eight  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#31:1:A>
I would like to show now <,> a map <,> which is quite <}> <->  
accurate </-> <+> accurately </+> </}> drawn <,> during the historical period  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#32:1:A>
Here <,,> you have <,> a map <,> which was drawn in the year  
sixteen seventy-eight <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#33:1:A>
And it is the <w> history's </w> first <,> accurately drawn map  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#34:1:A>
It represents facts <,,> which is drawn with true to scale <,> and  
the colour <,> which you could see here is nothing but <,> hand painted  
colour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#35:1:A>
After <,> watching <,> the historical map <,> which is hand painted  
<,> the maps have gone <,,> a revolution <,> in terms of painting and  
production <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#36:1:A>
<w> Today's </w> maps <,> are multicoloured <,> and looks <,>  
pleasant <,> and more informative <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#37:1:A>
But <,> the maps <,> have also incorporated <,> concepts like <,>  
direction <,> distance <,> and <,> location <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#38:1:A>
These three concepts <,> have been given <,> more importance <,> in  
the modern maps <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#39:1:A>
I would like to show <,> a map of <,> Tamil Nadu <,> wherein <,>  
the concept of location <,> direction <,> and distance <,> could be <,>  
easily seen <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#40:1:A>
We have a map here <,,> which is <,,> a <,,> representation of <,>  
Tamil Nadu <,> state <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#41:1:A>
If you look into this map <,> very carefully <,,> the first thing  
that comes to your mind <,> is <,> the location of <,> places <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#42:1:A>
Here I have <,> the location of Bangalore <,> which is given <,> in  
the form of a black dot <,,> and this is exactly known as <,> location of a  
particular place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#43:1:A>
Our next concept <,,> is <,> the <,> direction <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#44:1:A>
I have here <,> marked a red arrow line <,> facing <,> towards the  
top <,> which is nothing but <,> the northern direction <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#45:1:A>
In other words <,> most of the maps <,> are prepared <,> towards  
northern direction <,> on the top of the map <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#46:1:A>
Well <,> from the direction <,> we move to the scale <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#47:1:A>
The scales are given <,,> at the bottom <,> sometimes both in the  
form of figures as well as in the form of <,> equivalance <,> roughly six  
point eight miles on the ground <,> represented on one centimetre in the map  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#48:1:A>
A map contains <,,> two important components <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#49:1:A>
Number one <,,> it is a skill <,,> in art <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#50:1:A>
Number two <,> it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a  
map <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#51:1:A>
Skill in art means <,,> the <,,> designing of a map <,,>  
positioning of letters <,,> symbols <,,> title writing <,,> and drawing the  
<,> components inside a map <,> which should be more pleasing <,> aesthetic  
<,> to the viewer <,> or to a map user <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#52:1:A>
Similarly <,> the second part of it which I call it as a technical  
drafting <,> is a very difficult job <,> because <,,> the maps <,> have to be  
<,> drawn according to scale <,> and the information <,> have to be  
transferred <,> into a map <,> in a systematic manner <,> so that <,> the  
minds <,> idea follow the <,,> things in a very very systematic manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#53:1:A>
It is very difficult to understand what is the step by step <,>  
movements <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#54:1:A>
Because <,> a map <,> is a highest form of graphic <,,> it is in a  
position to create a visual image in your mind <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#55:1:A>
You will keep things in your mind for a long time to come <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#56:1:A>
Its quite easier <,> to understand that <,> map is a very powerful  
tool of communication <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#57:1:A>
I would like to now explain <,,> how <,> a written text <,,> and a  
map <,> if they are together <,> how do they convey the message <,> to you  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#58:1:A>
Let us look at <,> a small piece of information <,> which I have  
taken <,> from a newspaper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#59:1:A>
We will look into that <,> in a <,> more <,> systematic manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#60:1:A>
Here is a small cutting <,> wherein you will be able to see <,> the  
text which is written <,> over here <,> and simultaneously on the other side  
a map is drawn <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#61:1:A>
Perhaps <,,> you will understand that <,> this map <,> is  
complementary <,> to the text <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#62:1:A>
I do agree <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#63:1:A>
But <,> if you look into the text very carefully <,> you will know  
that <,> as you read the sentences <,> it will go into your mind <,> and you  
will be able to understand the news <,> in a systematic manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#64:1:A>
Perhaps if you read only the first sentence <,> and jump into the  
last sentence <,> you will miss the message <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#65:1:A>
You will not be able to receive <,> anything <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#66:1:A>
Therefore <,> you are required to move sentence by sentence to  
understand <,> the message <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#67:1:A>
So is the case with the map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#68:1:A>
If I have to say <,> <quote> Today I am going to deal with Kuwait  
</quote> <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#69:1:A>
That means first I should know where Kuwait is located in the  
Middle East <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#70:1:A>
And here is the small insert map <,> which gives an idea that where  
is Kuwait located <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#71:1:A>
From that you move on to the <,> Kuwait <,> and its surrounding  
countries <,> with physical as well as cultural features <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#72:1:A>
So your eye and mind goes step by step <,> from one message to  
another message <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#73:1:A>
All these messages are <,> slowly <,> steadily kept in your mind  
<,> and you can retrieve this message <,> in a more systematic manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#74:1:A>
In addition to this <,> possibly you not only store this message in  
your mind you will be able to interpret the <,> news in a much more  
scientific way <,,> in order to understand the situation better <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#75:1:A>
Therefore <,> I would say that <,> map is a very powerful tool of  
communication <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#76:1:A>
Let us look at <,> the map in the form of a globe <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#77:1:A>
You are able to see <,> this globe now <,> wherein <,> the land  
<,,> sea <,,> are distributed in aesthetical manner <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#78:1:A>
This is more or less <,> true to the reality <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#79:1:A>
But <,> you will be able to see that <,> the size of the land <,>  
especially <,> if you could watch the Greenland <,> which is quite small in  
size <,> as compared with <-> the </-> <,,> Canada <,> United States <,>  
etcetera <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#80:1:A>
But <,> if this globe <,> has to be broken into several parts <,>  
and then represent in a plain sheet of paper <,> how difficult it will be  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#81:1:A>
It will be definitely difficult <,> to represent this <,> on a  
plain sheet of paper <,> because this will be distorted <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#82:1:A>
Once it is distorted <,> the figures will not appear clearly <,>  
the shape <,> size <,> scale will all vary <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#83:1:A>
Therefore there is a need <,> of mathematical calculation of <,>  
latitudes and longitudes <,> to be corrected in such a manner <,> so that  
entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#84:1:A>
For this process we use a technical term <,> known as projection  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#85:1:A>
The projection is nothing but arrangement of <,> latitude and  
longitude in such a manner <,> so that you represent the <,> surface of the  
earth <,> any part of the surface of the earth according to correct shape <,>  
and size <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#86:1:A>
Here is a world map <,> wherein the entire land and ocean is  
represented <,> in a plain sheet of paper <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#87:1:A>
You are able to see the Greenland <,> which is <,> bigger than <,>  
Canada <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#88:1:A>
Whereas in the previous scene we have seen <,> in the globe that  
Greenland was much smaller than Canada <,> this indicates that the  
representation of the sphere <,> on a plain sheet of paper <,> necessarily  
brings <,> distortion of shape and size <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#89:1:A>
Now <,,> symbols are the most important components <,> of a map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#90:1:A>
I would like you to look at the symbols <,> which are given <,> in  
a map <,> drawn for India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#91:1:A>
If we <,> look into this map <,,> it is a tourist <,> road map <,,>  
of India <,,> wherein <,,> the <,> symbols are given in different forms <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#92:1:A>
The first and the foremost symbol <,> is the administrative symbols  
<,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#93:1:A>
In other words <,> the administrative symbols are nothing but lines  
<,> drawn <,,> to show the administrative boundaries <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#94:1:A>
Now <,> this particular line <,,> is a line which separates India  
from Nepal <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#95:1:A>
And this administrative line is known as international boundary  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#96:1:A>
When we come down you will be able to see <,> the boundary line  
which separates <,> Uttar Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#97:1:A>
Again this is another symbol which represents the <,>  
administrative set up of the country <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#98:1:A>
After that the most important symbol that we would like to look  
into <,> is the physical symbol <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#99:1:A>
Physical means <,> that the representation of <,> the physical  
details of a map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#100:1:A>
Here we are able to see the river <,> which is given in the form  
of a blue line <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#101:1:A>
Now <,> usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one  
is able to perceive the reality in <,> without much difficulty <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#102:1:A>
After the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most  
us <,> is the cultural symbols <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#103:1:A>
The cultural symbols <,> the good example will be a road <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#104:1:A>
Now the Hyderabad <,> is connected to <,> Nagpur via highway <,>  
which is given in the form of a red line <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#105:1:A>
Like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a  
sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic  
manner 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#106:1:A>
The next important component <,> is lettering <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#107:1:A>
The size <,> style <,> direction <,> of letters <,> do indicate  
<,> different type of messages <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#108:1:A>
The size of the letters <,> do indicate the hierarchy of place  
names <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#109:1:A>
The direction of letters also indicate the <,,> style as well as  
the slope of a river <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#110:1:A>
Similarly <,> if a group of islands have to be shown they are  
written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#111:1:A>
Now <,> in this map <,,> the first thing is that <,,> the title is  
written <,> in a corner <,,> below which you will find the scale is written  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#112:1:A>
Below the scale <,> you will find the term <,> legend <,,>  
indicating that <,> all the details <,> which have gone into the map <,> are  
given <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#113:1:A>
In other words <,> that <,> in the format <,,> one should be in a  
position to read first this <,> and then familarise himself <,> with the  
details <,> then go to the map <,> to read the map what it is all about <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#114:1:A>
The second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is  
<,> the design of the total format <,,> wherein you will be able to see <,>  
the inner line <,> will give you the latitude and longitude boundary <,> the  
outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#115:1:A>
All the details <,> should come between these <,,> lines which are  
known as neat lines <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#116:1:A>
In the black and white map <,> you are unable to distinguish <,,>  
between one region <,> to another region <,> and different symbols <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#117:1:A>
Whereas in a colour map <,> the eye catches the difference <,> at  
much faster rate <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#118:1:A>
In other words <,> from the point of your communication <,> it  
appears that <,> colour seems to play a most important role <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#119:1:A>
If we look into these maps <,> you will be able to see that <,>  
this is the map of the city of Madras <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#120:1:A>
It is a large scale map <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#121:1:A>
But <,> here we have the tourist map of Tamil Nadu which is a  
small scale map <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#122:1:A>
So maps can be classified on the basis of the scale <,> so that it  
is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#123:1:A>
We could see today in the world <,> the educationists <,> school  
children <,> scientists <,> planners <,,> administrators <,> politicians <,>  
business people <,> all of them are using the maps <,> in some form or other  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#124:1:A>
The man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#125:1:A>
The subject <,> which deals with <,> designing <,> drafting and  
printing of maps usually known as cartography <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#126:1:A>
Well <,> today we could see that the developments in the field of  
cartography <,> or in the preparation of maps <,> have reached such a high  
standard that <,> computer technology <,> and satellite imageries have come  
into <,> a great way in expanding the scope of mapping the earths surface <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#127:1:A>
Maps are part and parcel of life <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#128:1:A>
One is able to convey the message more effectively <,> accurately  
<,> scientifically <,> through maps <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#129:1:A>
And it reminds us a graphical age <,> in your mind <,> the years  
to come <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2B-032#130:1:A>
I am sure you will also agree with me that <,> there is a need to  
create this awareness <,> in the utility of maps <,> in the <w> man's </w>  
life <,,> </I>
