<h> <ul> CONCEPT AND STRATEGY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA </ul> </h>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#2:1>
<h> <ul> INTRODUCTION </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#3:1>
The significance of rural development for our country where 40 %
of population lives below the poverty line cannot but be overemphasised.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#4:1>
As a matter of fact it has a socio-political aspect as well.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#5:1>
So the Government of India was committed for evolving a strategy that
would emeliorate the lot of 70 percent of our population living in rural
areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#6:1>
This has been one of the most formidable and fundamental aspect of <w>
India's </w> development efforts. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#7:1>
<h> <ul> CONCEPT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#8:1>
The concept of <quote> ` rural development' </quote> can be
explained in the context of agriculture and it remained, for a long time, <}>
<-> conterminus </-> <+> coterminus </+> </}> with agricultural development
in India <}> <-> , </-> <+> . </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#9:1>
<}> <-> the </-> <+> The </+> </}> Royal Commission on Agriculture (
1928) gave the interpretation to rural development like this:

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#10:1>
<quote> " We cannot too strongly state our conviction that the
directorship of agricultural advance must in a very great degree depend upon
the suitability of the officer appointed." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#11:1>
Another Committee after fifty years took a more or less similar
view of rural development.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#12:1>
In 1972, the Planning <w> Commission's </w> Task Force on Integrated
Rural Development observed that <quote> " After careful consideration, we
have belatedly decided to take what might be considered rather restricted
view of the expression ` <quote> rural development' </quote> we have chosen
to equate it with agricultural development in the widest sense so as to
embrace besides crop husbandary, all the allied activities." </quote> </p>
<O> <&> page </&> 2 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#13:1>
The concept of rural development, since the seventies has
undergone a change and has become more comprehensive.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#14:1>
<mention> The World Bank </mention> defines rural development as a
strategy desiged to improve the economic and social life of a specific group
of people that is the rural poor.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#15:1>
It involves extending the benefits of development to the poorest
among those who are living in the rural areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#16:1>
This group includes small-scale farmers, tenants and the landless.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#17:1>
Here, it is appropriate to quote from the <mention> World Bank sector
policy paper </mention> which stated that <quote> ` Rural
Development<->'</-> should include a mix of activities including projects
to raise agricultural output, create new employment, improve health and
education, expand communications and improve housing' </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#18:1>
Hence, it is wrong to equate rural development with agricultural
development alone, although agriculture may be at the centre of the stage.
</p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#19:1>
<h> <ul> COMPONENTS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#20:1>
A good policy designed to bring about the rural development
should incorporate the following components :

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#21:1>
1) The first component of such a policy should be <quote> ` man'
</quote> and his environment, which should aim at creating skills and
knowledge so that man can exploit his environment and can expand his
resources for both the better quality of his lilfe and the life of his
community by improving his family - - kinship life styles.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#22:1>
2) The second important focus should be on the ecological setting
since rural is in contrast to urban and its development should have balanced
approach to urban development. <O> <&> page </&> 3 </O>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#23:1>
3) The third component of rural development should be the means of
production and appropriate technology.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#24:1>
Among the factors of production the most important in the village
setting is land.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#25:1>
The exploitation of land to its maximum capacity will depend upon the
technical know-how employed in terms of its production of different types of
crops water management resources, quality of seeds, application of the right
type of seeds, application of the right type of manure or fertilizer suitable
to the soil conditions and other means like technology and labour force to
irrigate and cultivate the land.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#26:1>
4) The fourth component of rural development is the building of
institution infrastructure essential for mobilising economic resources and
the organisation and management of men, money and material resources.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#27:1>
5) Self-reliance is the fifth component of rural development and it
is needed to be brought in through local initiative participation and
mobilisation of exiting resources.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#28:1>
6) The sixth and last component or rural development is the focus on
distributive justice in so far as the poor segments of the rural population
are concerned. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#29:1>
Thus in formulating the rural development policy, the whole
approach has to be fundamental and targeted towards alleviating the rural
poor from the <quote> ` culture of poverty' </quote> which has been
perpetuated over the ages.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#30:1>
The following chart disclose the various components of rural
development. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 4 </O> <O> tree diagram </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#31:1>
Thus, it may be said, agricultural development is a major part of
rural development but that is not the total plan.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#32:1>
Rural development is a broader concept and is concerned with the
total development of the rural economy as a whole.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#33:1>
It is a wholistic concept rather than a sequential one.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#34:1>
So it is equally concerned with the development of infrastructure
like <mention> roads, transport, power, insurance and banking, development of
cottage industries, rural poverty, unemployment, encouraging traditional
crafts and industries and providing modern education, health facilities
</mention> and providing cheap but decent houses for the rural poor and
deprived. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#35:1>
The concept of rural development is not a new one.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#36:1>
It has received the attention of <-> a </-> people like Gandhiji,
Tagore and others much before independence.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#37:1>
<w> Tagore's </w> <mention> Shantiniketan </mention> was perhaps the
first systematic attempt in this direction.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#38:1>
The problem of rural reconstruction however was concretised by
Gandhiji.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#39:1>
He experienced the toil, drudgery and sub-human living conditions in
villages of India.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#40:1>
Having lived it Gandhiji knew for certain that unless and until the
village economy of India was boosted, <O> <&> page </&> 5 </O> <quote> `
Swayaraja' </quote> would be meaningless.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#41:1>
The soil of India, he said with agony and anguish lives in villages
and <w> India's </w> salvation lay in rural reconstruction.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#42:1>
It is not surprising, thus, to note that the new government
decided to give highest priority to agriculture and rural development
programmes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#43:1>
The dividing forces behind such a philosophy were a firm belief in
the humanistic ideology of Gandhiji and a very rational approach of
increasing agricultural productivity. </p>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#44:1>
<h> <ul> RURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PLAN PERIODS </ul> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#45:1>
Then the government of India was committed to formulate various
plan policies on rural development during the plan periods which are given
below : PLAN POLICY I 1951-56 Community Development as method and national
extension service as the agency. II 1956-61 Co-operating farming local
participation. III 1961-66 Panchayat Raj three-tier model of democratic
decentralisation. IV 1969-74 Special clientele-based and area-based
programmes. V 1974-79 Introduces the concept of <quote> ` minimum needs'
</quote> . VI 1980-85 Emphasis on strengthening the socio-economic
infrastructure in rural areas, alleviating rural poverty and reducing
regional disparities.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#46:1>
Integrated Rural Development Programme. VII 1985-90 Emphasis on
creating new employment opportunities, special programmes for income
generation through asset endowments, land reform participation of people at
gross-roots level. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 6 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#47:1>
The following are the various rural development programmes
conceived and implemented in our country from time to time :

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#48:1>
1) Small Farmers Development Agency ( SFDA)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#49:1>
2) Marginal Farmers Agricultural Labour ( MFAL)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#50:1>
3) Drought Prone Area programme ( DPAP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#51:1>
4) Desert Development Programme ( DDP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#52:1>
5) Command Area Development Programme ( CADP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#53:1>
6) Tribal Area Programme ( TAP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#54:1>
7) Hill Area Programme ( HAP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#55:1>
8) Integrated Rural Development Programme ( IRDP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#56:1>
9) Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment ( TRYSEM)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#57:1>
10) Crash Programme for Rural Employment Programme.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#58:1>
11) Pilot Intensive Rural Employment Programme.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#59:1>
12) Food for Work programme

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#60:1>
13) National Rural Employment Programme ( NREP)

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#61:1>
14) Minimum Needs Programme

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#62:1>
15) Pilot Project on Government Centres

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#63:1>
16) 20-Point Programme

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#64:1>
17) Western Ghat Development Programme

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#65:1>
18) Special Programme for North-Eastern Region.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#66:1>
19) Special Incentive Programme for the Industrially Backward Areas.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#67:1>
20) Rural Labour Employment Guarantee Programme. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#68:1>
Thus the concept of rural developoment has been changing from
time to time and according to the need of <-> villages </-> people, the
Government has launched various rural development programmes.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#69:1>
But the government should see whether they have been implemented in
full.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#70:1>
Then only <O> <&> page </&> 7 </O> the condition of rural people will
be improved and the purpose for which the programmes were started, will be
fulfilled.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#71:1>
So the government, policy framers and social reformers should focus
their attention towards the welfare of 70 percent of our population who live
in villages and seventy percent of the work force who depends on agriculture
and alllied activities. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W1A-010#72:1>
Though the reasons for the rural development may be political in
our country, it should be also approached with academic or human <}> <->
consideration. </-> <+> considerations. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#73:1>
Generally, it is said that India lives <}> <-> on villages. Where
</-> <+> in villages where </+> </}> the pillars and builders of Nation live.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#74:1>
For their upliftment rural development is very essential.

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#75:1>
Unless rural economy is improved the indian economy will not be
improved to our <}> <-> expectation. </-> <+> expectations. </+> </}>

<ICE-IND:W1A-010#76:1>
So the development of rural economy depends upon the extent on which
the rural development takes place in our country. <*> three stars in the
middle of the line </*> </I>
