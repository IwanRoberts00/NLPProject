<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#1:1:A>
When did you go to the <.> U </.> UK <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#2:1:A>
So <,> uh what are you to say about your <,> Marxism and things like
that <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#3:1:B>
Marxism <,,> is supposed <,> to <O> one word </O> <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#4:1:A>
Uhm <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#5:1:A>
When did you first start reading on Marxism actually <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#6:1:B>
Well <,,> I didn't read <,,> at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#7:1:B>
I think <,,> it was <,> from <,,> my locality that I <,,> I <,> got
the idea

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#8:1:A>
Uhm <,,> because you happened to be with Marxist you thought it
is a very good ideology <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#9:1:B>
Well <,,> I didn't know anything about <,> ideology aspects <,>
in the beginning <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#10:1:B>
In <,> my place I mean <,> in <,,> our locality <,> there were
people <,,> who were not <,,> who called some some Marxists <,> <{2> <[2> uhm
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#11:1:B>
And they had a peculiar way <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,> which attracted
me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#12:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#13:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#14:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#15:1:A>
<}> <-> What are that </-> <=> what are that </=> </}>
peculiar way <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#16:1:B>
Well you know the so called <,> co-operation <,> <{1> <[1> uhm
<,> the way they see <,> with the way they <,> treat people <,> <{2> <[2> uhm
<,> the way they talk <,> the way they behave <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#17:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#18:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#19:1:A>
So this <,> this attracted you <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#20:1:A>
You <?> struct </?> your something <,> <{> <[> yeah <,> uh which
which the other ideologists didn't had <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#21:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#22:1:B>
Yes <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#23:1:A>
Uhm is that <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#24:1:B>
<w> That's </w> what I think <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#25:1:A>
Which means that <,> uh if you were brought up in a different
<.> en </.> environment <,> say for example among the Christians or among <,>
among the Muslims or among <,> among the Jains and Buddhists <,,> say you
would have accepted that ideology

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#26:1:B>
No no no <,> because you know <,> uh I was among the
Christians <,> I was among the Hindus <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> but neither
Christianity nor Hinduism affected me <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#27:1:B>
Only this <,,> particular <,,> way <,,> of living <,> as we call
<,> it is the Marxist <}> <-> way </-> <=> way </=> </}> of living <,> it
only attracted me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#28:1:B>
Because it had something speciality <,> <{3> <[3> uhm uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#29:1:B>
Something this <,> something that <,,> uhm <}> <-> that </-> <=>
that </=> </}> makes it <,> uh distinct from <,> Hinduism or Christianity
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#30:1:B>
I do not like Hinduism <,> and I do not like Christianity <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#31:1:B>
But I like Marxism <,> because it makes a man think about people
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#32:1:B>
It makes a man think about his own fellow men <,> and also about
his place in the <,> world <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#33:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#34:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#35:1:A>
<[3> Uhm uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#36:1:A>
Well what has Marx to say about the things which happened <,>
before eighteen what is it <,> seventeen eighty <.> wh </.> when was Marx
born <,> seventeen eighty <,> eighty-three eighty-five

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#37:1:B>
No no <,> Marx was born <,,> in the <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#38:1:A>
Well I think

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#39:1:B>
Nineteenth century <,> but <{> <[> Marxism </[> <,> Marxism
began with <,> Marxism began with <,,> property <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#40:1:B>
Marxism lived <,> through <,> <{1> <[1> uh no no <,,> plight okay
<,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#41:1:B>
It was a democrator <,> and then <,,> that this was followed by <,>
a generation of <,> thinkers <,> and finally <,,> uh it came to Hegel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#42:1:B>
Hegel had his views <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#43:1:B>
And then Marx <,,> Marx had his own views <,> and he developed into
<,> an ideology <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#44:1:B>
The form that we <,> have now

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#45:1:A>
<[> Uh no no </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#46:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#47:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#48:1:A>
<O> One word </O> uh <w> that's </w> fine <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#49:1:A>
Well how does <-> a </-> marxism help you in your class <,> uh in
your teaching <,> whether it it help you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#50:1:A>
Will it help you to teach Shakespeare <,> or uh language <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#51:1:A>
<{> <[> Does it help you </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#52:1:B>
<[> Well we can look </[> at Shakespeare from <,> uh a Marxist
angle <,> for example <,> in <,,> <mention> Hamlet </mention> we can we can
<,> uh take the case of <mention> Hamlet </mention>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#53:1:B>
<mention> Hamlet </mention> sees <,> the fall <,,> of his mother
<,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> not of the fault of that particular individual <,> <{2>
<[2> uhm <,> but as the <,> defect <,> of the <,> world in general <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#54:1:B>
This is the Bourgeois approach <,> to human experience <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#55:1:B>
An individual experience <,> cannot be the experience of <,>
everybody in this world <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#56:1:B>
So in that way <,> one cannot <,,> according to Marxist thinkers
<,> one cannot universalise <,> a <.> on </.> a particular experience

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#57:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A>

<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#60:1:A>
Uhm <,,> uhm uhm <,,> <{> <[> so </[> once you explain a text
like this uh

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#61:1:B>
<[> So </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#62:1:B>
When we explain a text like <,,> Shakespeare <,> uh a
Shakespearean play <,> the interpretation will be <{> <[> in that way </[>
uhn

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#63:1:A>
<[> <O> One or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#64:1:A>
Okay how does it help you in your teaching of language <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#65:1:B>
Well <,,> there is no answer

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#66:1:A>
Uhm <,,> how does it help you in your family life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#67:1:A>
Talking to your wife <{> <[> and children </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#68:1:B>
<[> Family life </[> </{> <,> in family life it helps a lot
<,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#69:1:B>
Because <,,> in <,> Indian society <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,> which
follows <,> one a particular system <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#70:1:B>
I mean <,> a male dominated <,> Indian society <,> <{4> <[4> uhm
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#71:1:B>
Uh <,> <w> it's </w> rigid <,> <{5> <[5> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#72:1:B>
And Marxism <,> makes it <,> flexible

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#73:1:B>
We <,,> uh we are told <,> to look at women <,,> in a way we should
look at <,> <-> a </-> humanity

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#74:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#75:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#76:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<[5> Uhm </[5> </{5>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#79:1:A>
<w> That's </w> what even feminism says <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#80:1:A>
Feminism didn't say anything very different

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#81:1:B>
Oh feminism may be imitating the Marxist <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#82:1:A>
Uhm uhm uhm <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#83:1:C>
So why did it fail in Russia <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#84:1:B>
Why <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#85:1:C>
Why did it fail in Russia <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#86:1:B>
Why did it fail in Russia <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#87:1:B>
See <,> it was <,> the fault was not with <,> Marxism <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#88:1:B>
It wasn't with <,> it was not with <,> Marx

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#89:1:B>
It was <,> with the people <,> who were in Power <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#90:1:B>
<{> <[> <}> <-> There </-> <+> They </+> </}> were corrupt </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#91:1:C>
<[> If it is applicable </[> </{> to Marxism <,> is not
applicable to any other ism then <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#92:1:B>
Well <w> I'm </w> not aware of any other ism <,> at present
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#93:1:B>
Why Marxism failed in Russia <,> is an open question <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#94:1:B>
People have been discussing <,,> for a long time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#95:1:B>
And people

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#96:1:C>
Once you <{> <[> say </[> that <,> there is something wrong
with the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#97:1:C>
And <,> nothing wrong with an ideology <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#98:1:B>
<[> Know </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#99:1:B>
There wasn't anything <{> <[> wrong with the Russian <,> the
ideology </[> that <,> Russians had <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#100:1:B>
Well the people in power were <,> wrong

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#101:1:B>
They went wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#102:1:B>
And they and their system <O> two word </O>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#103:1:B>
And <,> the foreign intervention <,> intervention from the part of
<,> American <,> and all other capitalist nations <,> were also there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#104:1:B>
They were trying for a long time <,> to destroy the Soviet Union
since its <,> inception in <,,> uh <,> in nineteen <,> seventeen <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#105:1:B>
They have been trying <,> for a long time to destroy the set- up
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#106:1:B>
Well Stalin with his iron hands <,> could <,,> uh prevent the
Soviet set-up from destruction <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#107:1:B>
But the later <,> rulers couldn't <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#108:1:C>
<[> If any other ideology <O> one or two words </O> </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#109:1:A>
Uhm <O> one word </O> <w> it's </w> okay <,> uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#110:1:C>
Can a thing be prevented with iron hands <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#111:1:B>
Yes many things <,> could be prevented <,> with iron hands

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#112:1:C>
Means they are <,> prevented

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#113:1:B>
For example <{> <[> that was what that was what Stalin Stalin
did in Russia </[> <,> uhn

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#114:1:C>
<[> But if they are prevented with iron hands what </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#115:1:C>
Or if something is prevented with iron hands <,> <{1> <[1>
uhn <,> it means <,> <{2> <[2> uhn <,> the person who prevents <,> <{3> <[3>
uhn <,> is likely to be again <,> <{4> <[4> uhn <,> destroyed by iron hands
<,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#116:1:B>
<[1> Uhn </[1> </{1>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#117:1:B>
<[2> Uhn </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#118:1:B>
<[3> Uhn </[3> </{3>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#119:1:B>
<[4> Uhn </[4> </{4>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#120:1:B>
Suppose someone is going to destroy your society <,,> and
suppose there is strong person <,> with a very strong force <,> to protect
the society <,> well he is doing a good job <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#121:1:B>
He is saving the society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#122:1:B>
So that was exactly what <,> Stalin did <{> <[> in Russia </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#123:1:C>
<[> But those </[> </{> who oppose

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#124:1:B>
You know the

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#125:1:C>
But those who oppose if you destroy them <,> <{> <[> uhn <,>
then it means that you are doing a something good for the society <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#126:1:B>
<[> Uhn </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#127:1:B>
Yes if the society has a cancer of hand <,> it has to be cut

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#128:1:C>
Who is going to decide <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#129:1:B>
It is the people <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#130:1:C>
If it is the people <,> then other people had any voice

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#131:1:B>
Well

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#132:1:C>
If is a person <,> goes on destroying everyone

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#133:1:B>
Communism cannot succeed without the support of the people
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#134:1:B>
That was what happened <,> in <,> Kerala

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#135:1:B>
For example <?> Marxsism </?> failed in Kerala and West Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#136:1:B>
Why did it fail in Kerala and West Bengal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#137:1:B>
Because it wasn't a popular movement <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#138:1:B>
So communism failed <,> not communism <,> <?> Marxism </?> fail in
Kerala <,> in West Bengal also <,> the movement failed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#139:1:B>
It was because <,> the those people who <,> who were the <,>
opponents of that particular movement <,> uh could not influence people <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#140:1:A>
Okay fine

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#141:1:C>
Means uh if <,> if it failed in Russia <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> it
means people are not with Communism <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#142:1:B>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#143:1:B>
People are still with communism in Russia <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#144:1:B>
You know the way they <,> uh the way <,> they executed communism
<,> I mean <,> the how they practised communism <,,> that was wrong <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#145:1:C>
In what sense it is <O> one word </O> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#146:1:B>
What sense it is

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#147:1:C>
What what <,> those who are in power <,> <{1> <[1> uhn <,>
then they have something like politbureau <,> <{2> <[2> yeah <,> and the

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#148:1:B>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#163:1:B>
The people who were in power <,> for example in Russia <{> <[>
there was Gorbochov </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#164:1:C>
<[> But who comes in power </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#165:1:A>
Now actually these people

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#166:1:B>
<{> <[> He he </[> accepted the prize <,> who got the Nobel
Prize

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#167:1:C>
<[> No no </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#168:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#169:1:B>
Why did he accept the Nobel Prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#170:1:B>
What was Bernard <w> Shaw's </w> reaction <,> when he was awarded
the Nobel Prize <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#171:1:B>
Bernard Shaw was not a pure communist <,> but this man Gorbochov
<,> secretary of the C P S U accepted the noble prize <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#172:1:B>
And who are noble <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> the inventor <,> of uh
weapon intended to destroy humanity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#173:1:B>
Marxism stands for humanity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#174:1:B>
It is for the preservation of humanity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#175:1:B>
And this man <,,> Gorbochov <,> accepted a medal <,> meant for the
<,> capitalist profit motivated people <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#176:1:B>
So in that way <,> he <,> was <{> <[> going </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#177:1:C>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#178:1:C>
<[> Any </[> </{> person who comes <,> into power he comes
because of popular support <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#179:1:C>
But once he comes into power <,> he becomes power crazy <,> power
greedy

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#180:1:C>
He is after more and more power <,> and ultimately what happens he
finds everything is centred in him <,> and because of that <,> uh again <,>
he goes at basic principles of <O> one word </O> <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#181:1:B>
See this was not what happened in <,> the Soviet Union <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#182:1:B>
You may know about <,> uh that <{> <[> Perestroika and Glasnot
</[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#183:1:C>
<[> See see and there </[> </{> but there also again what
happens we find <,> that members of the politbureau <,,> they were previleged
people there <,> <{> <[> ah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#184:1:C>
But with if Marx <{> <[> was under </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#185:1:B>
<[> Ah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#186:1:B>
<[> That was </[> </{> not so in the past

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#187:1:C>
And the society <,> in which there are <O> one word </O> he
wants to have a classless society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#188:1:C>
And that dream he had <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#189:1:B>
Well <,,> uh I <,,> do not agree <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#190:1:A>
Okay fine <,> I think we talk about something else <,,> uhm
uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#191:1:C>
How did you enjoy your stay here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#192:1:B>
I enjoyed <,,> your company very much <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#193:1:A>
Why <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#194:1:B>
Because you know it is a very different sort of experience
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#195:1:B>
Because <,> in our state it is <,,> uh raining <,> <{1> <[1> uhm
<,> and <,> it is very unpleasant <,> <{2> <[2> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#196:1:B>
We can not sit like this <,> and chat because of the <,> uh tanned
<,> atmosphere and uh chill <,> <{3> <[3> uhm <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#197:1:B>
So <,> you know in that way and <,> uh again <w> it's </w> a
change <,> uhn uhn from the what we have been doing there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#198:1:B>
Now <w> I'm </w> in a different atmosphere <,> uh both physically
and mentally <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#199:1:B>
And so <,,> uh uh I feel that I can enjoy it <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#200:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#201:1:A>
<[2> Uhm </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#202:1:A>
<[3> Uhm </[3> </{3>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#203:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#206:1:C>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#207:1:A>
How fine <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#208:1:C>
Because all the while <,> I was in the company of very nice
people <,> <{1> <[1> uhm <,> educated <,,> again refined <,> those who have
very <,,> nice ideas to propogate <,> <{2> <[2> hm hm hm <,> and

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#209:1:A>
<[1> Uhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#210:1:A>
<[2> Hm hm hm </[2> </{2>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#211:1:B>
Well in that way you too <,> have an idea to propogate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#212:1:B>
You propogate Hinduism <,> and he propogates uh <,> <{> <[> Islam
<,> Islam <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#213:1:A>
<[> Islam </[> </{>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#214:1:C>
Uh yes <,,> uh you have recently been to your <,> <{1> <[1>
yeah <,> family <,> <{2> <[2> yeah <,> what about your children <,> wife <,>
how are they

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#215:1:A>
<[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#216:1:A>
<[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#217:1:A>
In fact uh <,,> my son and daughter <,,> they had asked me to
buy <,> buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#218:1:C>
Have they missed you a lot <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#219:1:A>
Yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their
sunglasses

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#220:1:A>
As soon as I went home <,> my son asked me <,> uh asked me for the
sunglasses <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#221:1:A>
Luckily I bought bought two bought two <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#222:1:A>
For the one <,> the one I bought for my son was very loose <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#223:1:A>
So he always wearing it <,> and slipped on his nose and he was <,>
uh he asked me <O> one or two words </O> putting in back <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#224:1:A>
Then when my daughter it fitted very well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#225:1:A>
So luckily <,> I I could I could bring I can buy them

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#226:1:A>
If not I would have had a tough time <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#227:1:A>
Then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#228:1:A>
She she cried <,> she wanted jewel somethings like that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#229:1:A>
Then I promised to buy some silk <indig> sarees </indig> for for
my wife <,> from Mysore

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#230:1:A>
Then she she wasn't very keen

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#231:1:A>
She said okay fine

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#232:1:A>
I think I get good one to buy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#233:1:A>
Then my <w> wife's </w> sister also wanted a <indig> saree
</indig>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#234:1:A>
Then two of her sisters also wanted <indig> sarees </indig> so I
<,> now I have to buy about four six <indig> sarees </indig> from here <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#235:1:A>
These are going to come about four thousand <indig> rupees
</indig> I think <w> I'll </w> have to spent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#236:1:A>
So yes I <O> one or two words </O> you don't worry <,> yes I can
get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that <w>
I'll </w> find <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#237:1:A>
So <w> I'm </w> just thinking what I should do

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#238:1:C>
What <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-033#239:1:A>
But then of course I have a hell of time travelling <,,> uh I
mean from here to <,> Erode and Erode to Trinavelli and Trinavelli to <,> uh
once again to Ooty <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#240:1:A>
No this is in Mysore stays and here and back

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#241:1:A>
Rather bit too much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#242:1:A>
For for first time <w> I've </w> been experiencing <,> so much of
trouble travelling

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#243:1:A>
Now after month of travelling sitting in a bus <,> and for two
nights continously a bit too much <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#244:1:A>
But then I really think whether whether I should have been taking
so much of trouble <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-033#245:1:A>
This one month <,> uh I mean my <,> I mean my OD <,> OD not not I
mean not being sanctioned till now <,> </I>
