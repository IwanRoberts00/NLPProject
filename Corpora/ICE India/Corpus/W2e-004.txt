<h> <bold> HARD TIMES IN KASHMIR </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#2:1>
W<smallcaps>HILE</smallcaps> the Union Home Minister, Mufti
Mohammed Sayeed, was perfectly right to distinguish between probllems in
Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, his assurance that the Government <quote> "
will be tough with the terrorists" </quote> can hardly be said to be
particularly enlightening.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#3:1>
With secessionist violence in the Kashmir valley worse than ever,
and disturbing reports of an exodus of minority community people from the
region, the nation is justified in demanding decisive action from the Centre.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#4:1>
Under normal circumstances, the onus of maintaining law and order in a
sensitive State should have been on the State Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#5:1>
However, Dr Farooq <w> Abdullah's </w> self-evident alienation from
his own people, and the total breakdown of the administration rule out such a
possibility.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#6:1>
For all the <w> Congress(I)'s </w> indignation at, the <w> Centre's
</w> <quote> " week-kneed" </quote> policy towards the militants, and the
Chief <w> Minister's </w> own claim that New Delhi conceded too much over
the Rubaiya Sayeed incident, it is clear now that there is little scope for
improvement so long as Dr Abdullah is in power.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#7:1>
Not only are his <w> Government's </w> credentials under a cloud,
but its willingness and ability to cope with insurgency are also suspect.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#8:1>
In fact, there may be reason to believe that aided and abetted by
Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir is looking for
an opportunity to score political points against the new National Front
regime in Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#9:1>
There is a naive belief that if the situation in the valley is
allowed to deteriorate even further, it will have an adverse effect on the
Union <w> Government's </w> standing, and lend substance to the Opposition
<w> leader's </w> charge that Mr V. P. Singh is compromising <w> India's </w>
unity and integrity.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#10:1>
Moreover, the Congress(I) is confident that failure in Kashmir will
encourage hardliners within the Janata Dal to flex their muscles, and that
the effect of such a development would be to mar prospects for the
reconciliation process in Punjab.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#11:1>
At the same tiem, the Congress(I) may hope to play on the <w> BJP's
</w> dissatisfaction with the <w> Centre's </w> reluctance to dismiss Dr
Abdullah and impose <w> Governor's </w> Rule in the State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#12:1>
What is puzzling, however, is that the Centre should have fallen into
this trap, for it is specious to argue that dismissal of the National
Conference Government in Srinagar would enable Dr Abdullah to regain
public sympathy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#13:1>
The ugly mood in the valley rules out that possibility. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#14:1>
Thanks to the mishandling of the situation, the <w> valley's </w>
populist rhetoric has again moved from being anti-Centre to anti-Indian,
and the secessionists and terrorists have completely eclipsed <w> Kashmir's
</w> mainstream opposition.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#15:1>
It is unlikely that the forces that have been unleashed can be
eradicated within a year, even if <w> Governor's </w> Rule is imposed.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#16:1>
Under the circumstances, the logic of the Home <w> Minister's </w>
decision to allow the problem to fester seems inexplicable.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#17:1>
True, there is the challenge of the Congress ( I) version of the
kidnapping incident, but Mr V. P. Singh should have nothing to fear unless it
is proved that he or his aides wilfully compromised national interests and
security.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#18:1>
However, this is not to suggest that the Mufti may not have
indulged in some game of manipulation in his home State.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#19:1>
The way Mr Buta Singh earlier mishandled the Punjab problem was a
pointer to the dangers of allowing <quote> " exiled" </quote> politicians
to have a finger in the affairs of troubled regions.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#20:1>
Whereas Mr Sayeed may be the right man for the <quote> " healing
touch" </quote> in Punjab, he may lack the necessary detachment to be able to
repeat the process in Kashmir.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#21:1>
Certain draconian measures have become overdue if secessionism is
to be eliminated from the valley, and these call for resilience to be able to
withstand adverse public opinion.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#22:1>
Consequently, only a politician with a constituency that is far
bigger than Kashmir can measure up to the job.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#23:1>
Sentimentalism should not be allowed to override the need for
counter-insurgency measures. </p> <&> across the two columns </&>

<h> <bold> MENEM MISSES THE MARK </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#25:1>
A<smallcaps>RGENTINA</smallcaps> is a country where economists
fear to tread.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#26:1>
Since last <w> July's </w> election of the President, Mr Carlos
Menem, <w> Argentina's </w> basket case economy has gone from bad to worse to
chaotic, and the chaos is nowhere more prevalent than in the highest offices
of the Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#27:1>
Mr Menem came to power on the crest of widespread popularity with an
electorate that ignored his past background of free-spending populism and
listened instead to his promises of better times.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#28:1>
In the beginning he assembled a Cabinet that looked ready to tackle
the <w> country's </w> hyperinflation and massive foreign debt in a
nononsense manner.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#29:1>
However, Mr Menem has since shown that economic reform for him means
fiscal prestidigitation rather than politically damaging but needed policies
like paring the bloated public sector, trimming the government deficit,
and deregulating the <w> country's </w> economy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#30:1>
Mr Menem has sought instead to try to solve <w> Argentina's
</w> inflation - - prices rose by 50 per cent in December alone - - through a
simplistic method of reducing the amount of money in circulation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#31:1>
His attempts to stop issuing new currency notes and to force
Argentinians to exchange their funds for long-term government bonds instead
of interest-bearing certificates and dollars - - the two methods by which
Argentinians have survived the constant devaluation of their currency - -
have come a cropper.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#32:1>
The only result has been a further downward slide for the Argentinian
austral, which lost two-thirds of its value against the dollar in a month,
more inflation, and the exhaustion of whatever goodwill his countrymen held
for their new President.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#33:1>
The one thing Mr Menem has mastered, besides avoiding hard decisions,
is the creation of emergency economic programmes that last an average
of a week apiece.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#34:1>
This was the technique of Mr Raul Alfonsin, his predecessor; Mr Menem
seems set to follow him into political oblivion. </p> <&> across two columns

<h> <bold> SARKARIA ON DELHI </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#36:1>
I<smallcaps>T</smallcaps> was widely expected that the Sarkaria
Committe, which examined the question of reorganization of <w> Delhi's
</w> administrative set-up and whose report was tabled in Parliament last
week, would recommend something short of Statehood for the sprawling
metropolis.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#37:1>
For though it was an anomaly that the capital should so far have
been denied the true substance of representative government even while it was
endowed with an elected metropolitan council and other democratic trappings,
it would have been even more anomalous to vest it with full Statehood when it
happens to be the national capital and seat of the Union Government.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#38:1>
The Sarkaria Committee has, therefore, wisely ruled out Statehood,
noting quite simply that if Delhi is made a full-fledged State, there will be
a constitutional division of sovereignty and functions between the
Government at the Centre and that in the national capital, and that such a
status would not <quote> " suit" </quote> Delhi.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#39:1>
It has, however, recommended a proper Legislative Assembly and a
Cabinet system of government in place of the present executive council.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#40:1>
The very sensible via media suggested by the committee should not be
unwelcome even to the BJP which spearheaded the demand for full Statehood.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#41:1>
The <w> Centre's </w> control over the national capital would,
under the recommendations, extend only to matters relating to law and
order, police and land, and the development of the metropolis in line with
its requirements would truly be the charge of the Government under the new
system, when it gets to be finally accepted.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#42:1>
There is, at present, some muted protest over the fact that the <w>
committee's </w> recommendations do not go far enough, but once it is
realized that these will only take away much vexatious burden from the
Metropolitan Government, leaving it free to concentrate earnestly on
development tasks, that protest should disappear.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#43:1>
Few will deny that the <w> committee's </w> recommendations do
meet the democratic aspirations of Delhi to the fullest extent, subject,
to be sure, to qualifications that are inevitable because of the reality of
Delhi being the national capital.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#44:1>
At any rate, the Centre would exercise the powers reserved for it
only with the tacit approval of the <w> city's </w> elected government and
by no means in a unilateral, or high-handed, manner as has been the case so
far.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#45:1>
<w> Delhi's </w> basic problem has been its multiplicity of
authorities, with virtually none of them under effective control.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#46:1>
That astonishing situation should end, once a fully representative
and duly elected government, as envisaged by the Sarkaria Committee,
takes charge. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> THE BALT BRIGADE </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#48:2>
T<smallcaps>HERE</smallcaps> is cold comfort in the thought that
<w> India's </w> is not the only federation under attack.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#49:2>
In fact, it may not be too much to say that the present crisis
between Moscow and the rebellious Baltic republic of Lithuania could well
decide the fate of perestroika as well as of the Soviet President, Mr Mikhail
Gorbachov.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#50:2>
Lithuanian secessionist fervour has been simmering for some time,
and the liberation of Eastern Europe has brought it to a boil.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#51:2>
Mr Gorbachov has indicated that he is not unopposed to autonomy for
the Baltic states so long as their freedom does not hinder his perestroika
programme for the Soviet Union as a whole.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#52:2>
This, in essence, means giving him time and doing nothing to
undermine his position.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#53:2>
But through their unilateral declaration of independence last
month the Lithuanians, led by their President, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, a
music teacher with a liking for dramatic movements but with no flair for
politics, refused to give Mr Gorbachov the benefit of either.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#54:2>
Many analysts feel that Mr Gorbachov would have been willing to grant
the Lithuanians the substance of independence if they had forgone the
symbols for the time being and kept a lid on the rhetoric, which is what the
more sober Estonians are doing. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#55:2>
It is noteworthy that the Western nations have been subdued in
their support for the Lithuanian cause, if not outright disparaging.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#56:2>
However, the present crisis could not have come at a worse time
for Mr Gorbachov.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#57:2>
With the introduction of the presidential system the Communist
Party is in the last stages of disintegration, its various factions
jostling for power.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#58:2>
In the midst of all this, the Soviet President is trying to maintain
his position and hold to the centre ground.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#59:2>
Allowing Lithuania to break away would almost surely lead to a chain
reaction of secessionism around the Russian periphery which would cost Mr
Gorbachov dear among radicals, conservatives and moderates.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#60:2>
One voice that is suddenly heard more often is the powerful Soviet
military which tolerated the loss of Eastern Europe but refuses to
countenance the surrender of what it considers to be an integral part of
the country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#61:2>
Mr Gorbachov is well aware of the role the military played in the
overthrow of Khrushchev and Beria; his position is further weakened by the
fact that he is on the verge of introducing radical eeconomic laws that will
take the Soviet Union directly into the realm of the free market. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#62:2>
The Lithuanian declaration is also troubling because of its
outright rejection of the constitutional process that the Soviet leader has
taken such great pains to introduce.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#63:2>
The constitution is the political heart of the new Soviet Union that
Mr Gorbachov wants to create.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#64:2>
He cannot take a challenge to it lightly, no matter what his own
political condition.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#65:2>
Mr Gorbachov is unlikely to use military force for fear it will
destroy all the international goodwill he has so carefully generated, but
the possibility of him going so far as to dismiss the Lithuanian parliament
cannot be ruled out.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#66:2>
While such strong-arm tactics are designed to show the Lithuanians
the impossibility of their cause - - the adversaries are so mismatched
that comparing the Balts to Lord <w> Cardigan's </w> Light Brigade would not
be too farfeteched - - he is clearly in search of a facesaving compromise.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#67:2>
The hasty passage of a Bill on the right to secede was aimed at
Lithuanian sensibilities.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#68:2>
For the Soviet leader, however, the issue at stake is not only
Lithuania, the issue is the survival of perestroika - - just as the
Kashmir controversy here embodies the future of secularism - - which is
why he cannot allow himself to lose. </p> <&> across two columns </&>

<h> <bold> OPTIONS ON OIL </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#70:2>
T<smallcaps>HE</smallcaps> Prime <w> Minister's </w> recent
statement in the <indig> Rajya Sabha </indig> hinting at the possibility of
petrol rationing confirms that Mr <w> Dandavate's </w> decision to
levy-sizable imposts on imports of crude and petroleum products was
inspired by the aim of reducing demand rather than raising revenue.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#71:2>
In fact, the Economic Survey for 1989-90 carried a broad hint of
the <w> Government's </w> thinking on the subject when it laid special
emphasis on the conservation of crude-related energy sources, warning that
<quote> " the use of energy per unit of output continues to be high,
judged by international standards" </quote> , and pointedly adding that
<quote> " the growth in the demand for energy needs to be contained
specially in the context of ( the) rise in prices" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#72:2>
What the survey did not state sufficiently firmly is that the
worsening balance of payments crisis left the authorities with little
choice but to take decisive action to cut down on consumption.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#73:2>
Mr V. P. Singh referred to this when he told the <indig> Rajya Sabha
</indig> that the current <w> year's </w> oil imports would cost around
<indig> Rs </indig> 8,000 <indig> crores </indig> compared to an estimated
Rs 6,400 <indig> crores </indig> for 1989-90 and an actual Rs 4,300
<indig> crores </indig> in 1988-89.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#74:2>
What passes understanding is why corrective action was not taken
earlier, say in the middle of 1989-90, when the trend must already
have become clear.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#75:2>
Indeed, the survey itself points to the fact that during
April-December of the year consumption of <quote> " petroleum oil and
lubricants" </quote> had attained a growth rate of 7.8 per cent against
the 7.2 per cent increase in 1988-89, and average rise of 6.5 per cent during
the first four years of the Seventh Plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-004#76:2>
But it would be incorrect to say that no steps at all were taken
during 1989-90 to conserve the use of energy.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#77:2>
What seems more accurate is that the measures taken were just not
effective enough.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#78:2>
This is the challenge that the Government faces: it will not only
have to develop efficient production systems but also have them accepted
at the grassroots level.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#79:2>
As the survey indicates, a lot of work has already been done in
this direction without, however, producing satisfactory results.

<ICE-IND:W2E-004#80:2>
The reasons for this failure will have to be established and
removed, which can turn out to be a much harder task than merely imposing
petrol rationing. </p> </I>
