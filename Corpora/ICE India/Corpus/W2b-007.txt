- the world of puppets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#4:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> Indian International
Puppetry Festival was held in New Delhi last month.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#5:1>
It threw open a <}> <-> Lilliputan </-> <+> Lilliputian </+> </}>
world of fun and fantasy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#6:1>
The festival brought puppets and puppeteers from 28 countries round
the world, perhaps the first time so many countries gathered under one roof
in India. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#7:1>
One could imagine the efforts that went into the gathering most of
them from distant lands with different cultures, traditions and political
systems. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#8:1>
Here, man had a novel experience of looking at himself in a
miniature form, articulating and expressing himself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#9:1>
While some actions seemed natural most of them struck as
unrealistic, comical but entertaining.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#10:1>
He seemed to enjoy his representation in caricature. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#11:1>
And reinforcing this experience were numerous other
characters and figures who shared the stage with this miniature man.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#12:1>
Most of them, of course, seemed to belong to a dream world or coming
straight out of the pages of a book of fairy tales. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#13:1>
Most puppeteers followed the old technique of manipulation - -
through strings, rods and fingers ( glove puppets) and projection.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#14:1>
But there were attempts at other techniques too. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#15:1>
Some manipulators appeared on the stage along with their puppets
displaying their skill, some seemed to become a part of the characters
themselves by donning masks, or holding on to the puppets from behind and
guiding movements and so on.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#16:1>
And some like the troupe from Vietnam chose water for
performances.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#17:1>
And then there were shadow puppets whose projection was fantastic
and colourful. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#18:1>
Notwithstanding the diversity, one could also discern a common
thread in concept, technique and purpose in puppetry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#19:1>
For instance, the clown, or <indig> Killekyata </indig> , and
<indig> Bangarakka </indig> of Karnataka shadow puppets had their
counterparts in Judy and Punch of UK.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#20:1>
Asian puppets maintain traditional forms while the Western ones take
a new direction. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#21:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> puppetry festival was
divided into three parts : Putul, an exhibition of puppets from different
countries; symposia on international trends in puppets, where nearly 40
experts took part; and, the performances. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#22:1>
Participating countries gave nearly 70 shows spread over a
fortnight.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#23:1>
In view of its requirement the Vietnamese troupe performed in the
swimming pool of a hotel. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#24:1>
The troupe provided sharp contrasts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#25:1>
On one side were countries with age-old traditions like India, China
and Japan, and on the other hand were countries where the art is only recent
( Madagascar, for instance).

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#26:1>
The art is being given a new orientation in places like France,
Chile and the Netherlands. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#27:1>
The Indian contingent consisted of string, shadow and rod
puppets and also mixed ones.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#28:1>
The Rajasthani <indig> Katputhli </indig> , <w> Karnataka's </w>
shadow puppets, and Suresh <w> Dutta's </w> attracted much attention. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#29:1>
The colour, action, buttressed by a bracy rhythm and racy
dialogues and backed by rich music, endeared the <indig> Katputhlis </indig>
, especially when those legless marionettes executed all foot movements.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#30:1>
The same could be said of the Uzbekian rod puppets played from below
behind a curtain.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#31:1>
It unfolded an old fairy tale of the region - - a blacksmith
winning the hands of a princess helped by a kindly crow. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#32:1>
The <indig> Yakshagana </indig> puppets from coastal Karnataka
depicted the story of <indig> Narakasura </indig> with the impact of live
performance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#33:1>
The Andhra shadow puppets came a close second. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#34:1>
Sri <w> Lanka's </w> <indig> Anura </indig> puppet <O> <&>
tantalizer </&> </O> group resembled Tamil <w> Nadu's </w> <indig>
Bommalattam </indig> in form, costume and ornaments.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#35:1>
The masked dances evoked the regional atmosphere. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#36:1>
With the popular character Khargoz holding centrestage, the
Turkish shadow puppets were closer to a cartoon move, while the Japanese
Kuruma Ningy was a class by himself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#37:1>
He manipulated the kimono-clad puppet while unfolding the tragic
tale of a peasant girl - - O Shichi, her love, death etc.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#38:1>
The effect was dramatic. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#39:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> </bold> Swiss Huber brothers - -
Michael and Tobias - - performed in the open.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#40:1>
Tobias provided the background music while <-> his </-> Michael
handled the puppets and voices.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#41:1>
The show opened with a small hump like screen on stage on which tiny
puppets flitted about.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#42:1>
Then Michael came on with Knusi the dwarf playing a horn.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#43:1>
This signalled an almost circus show where a frog, snail, butterfly
and a stone gained life. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#44:1>
Similar was the performance of the Canadian David Smith and two
members - - his wife and son.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#45:1>
They presented the story of the <it> Little Red Riding Hood </it> ,
with good audience participation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#46:1>
Zuzana Schmidovas performance of Czech puppets was suited
more for a school than a serious festival. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#47:1>
Indonesia is famous for its age old Wayang Kulit.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#48:1>
This time its team chose Wayang Golek i.e., rod puppets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#49:1>
The <foreign> dalang, tizor purbaya </foreign> sat with his
assistants in full view of the audience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#50:1>
While the fluid strains of Rebab filled the background, he presented
a story where Ghatodgaja and Arjuna, rather their Indonesian versions,
were the main characters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#51:1>
But introduction of an assorted set of figures drawn mostly from
present times, one of which also smoked and let off rings was incongruous.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#52:1>
And their antics gave a touch of slapstick to a serious performance
whose period atmosphere itself was lost. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#53:1>
Chile and Mali fell into a class by themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#54:1>
The puppeteers from Mali took part in the performance donning
masks and stamping along with their lifesize puppets to the spirited and
sensual rhythm of drums. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#55:1>
The Guinol troupe from Chile led by Anna Maria Allendes presented
a fairy tale entitled <foreign> <it> Las Dos Serpientes de la Tierra del Sur
</it> </foreign> from Easter Island.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#56:1>
It opened with a traditional dance before a small replica of the
megalithic statue of that island. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#57:1>
Dadi <w> Padamji's </w> <it> Waking Dreams </it> was another
effort of his Ishara troupe unveiling a sort of neutral area between the <}>
<-> conseious </-> <+> conscious </+> </}> and <}> <-> subconseious </->
<+> subconscious </+> </}> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#58:1>
Here the manipulator also functioned as a part of the puppet itself.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#59:1>
The experience was abstract.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#60:1>
The presence of the manipulators no doubt provided an
opportunity to the audience to appreciate their method and skill, but
it was also distracting. </p> <O> continued on Page 6 </O> <O> continued from
Page 1 </O> <O> <&> heading from column 1 to 4 </&> </O> <&> column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#61:1>
The element of mystery and fantasy which is the heart of the
matter of puppet art was diluted and even disappeared. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#62:1>
In this light, witnessing the <}> <-> Vitnamese </-> <+>
Vietnamese </+> </}> performance was a highly rewarding experience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#63:1>
It is essentially a <w> people's </w> art whose themes reflect folk
life and beliefs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#64:1>
A colourful pavilion had been erected at one end of the
swimming pool.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#65:1>
A screen covered the lower part down to the water level.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#66:1>
Behind the screen stood the manipulators in chest-level water
directing the actions of puppets performing in front at some distance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#67:1>
The traditional <foreign> Chu Teu </foreign> , something like our
<indig> Sootradhara </indig> , bobbed up introducing the subjects.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#68:1>
Next came a wide range of characters, men, birds, beasts, mythical
creatures like dragons, unicorns, splashing, swimming, fighting and thus
enacting short themes.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#69:1>
The dragons spewing smoke and fire <O> <&> tantalizer on top,
column 2 & 3 </&> </O> freely sailed, splashed and twisted while beautiful
background music made the effect more enchanting.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#70:1>
The water ballet was like a scene from the Arabian Nights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#71:1>
<bold> <smallcaps> AND </smallcaps> </bold> then there was the
symposium which covered puppetry as an educational medium, parallel
traditions and contemporary trends spread over six sessions. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#72:1>
Nearly 40 scholars, delegates and practitioners from different
countries participated.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#73:1>
Some spoke extempore while others, especially from abroad, read
prepared papers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#74:1>
It was an interesting experience to hear sounds of several brands
of English delivered with a variety of intonations and dictions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#75:1>
The papers mostly concentrated on the history of the art and were
fairly lengthy stretching time further in the translations.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#76:1>
A few had also brought puppets to illustrate points.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#77:1>
But Prof. Percy Press of UK dispensed with this formality and allowed
his Punch and Judy to speak than speech-making himself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#78:1>
These proceedings brought some problems universal to this art.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#79:1>
First, <w> society's </w> negative attitude which feels puppetry is
only for children, ignoring the other potentialities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#80:1>
Second, even those involved in mass communication programmes neither
deigned to understand or avail the potentialities of puppetry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#81:1>
Third, the conditions of the practitioners of this timehonoured
art.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#82:1>
They seem to occupy a low priority area in all countries. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#83:1>
Neither society nor the state was evincing interest in
supporting these struggling practitioners to preserve an art of great
antiquity and making it more functional and in tune with the needs of the
times. </p> <*> filled small circle </*> <&> line above & below, tantalizer

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#87:1>
The characters - - men, birds, beasts, mythical creatures like

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#91:2>
<bold> A </bold> <smallcaps> FESTIVAL </smallcaps> of
performing arts was held this July in Paris.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#92:2>
Of the two groups that participated from India, one was a string
puppet troupe from Belloor village in Nagamangala taluk ( Mandya ) , the
other from Kalakshetra, Madras.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#93:2>
Both were to perform sequences from the <indig> <it> Ramayana </it>
</indig> in the <indig> Yakshagana </indig> style through string puppetry;
singing chorus to the beat of the drums and cymbals, while the performers
play from behind manipulating the strings. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#94:2>
Only the puppets are seen on the specially erected stage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#95:2>
Between singing, the dialogues are mouthed by the performers to
the <quote> " acting" </quote> by the puppets.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#96:2>
The performers virtually enact the emotions from behind, all the
while making the puppets <quote> " act" </quote> . </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#97:2>
<indig> Shri Bhuvaneshwari Sootrada Bombe Yakshagana Mela ( Shri
Bhuvaneshwari </indig> string puppet folk theatre group) was constituted
in the present form 15 years ago.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#98:2>
The principal performer, the main singer, director and the leader
of the troupe, B.H. Puttashamachar, has been at it from his childhood. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#99:2>
It was a family tradition and vocation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#100:2>
Some of the important puppets he has are his <w> grand-father's
</w> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#101:2>
He also carves puppets from wood - - a local variety called <indig>
<it> ale mara </it> </indig> from which the famous Channapatna dolls too are
made. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#102:2>
The old ones act as a guide, he says.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#103:2>
The wood structure <}> <-> are </-> <+> is </+> </}> held sacred.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#104:2>
The change to the present wood has given greater flexibility in
carving and the use of oil paints on the puppets make it glow under bright
lights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#105:2>
But their longevity may not be comparable to the older puppets
which were more rugged and lasting but not very sophisticat ed by <w>
today's </w> standards.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#106:2>
Even in the folk medium the waves of change do make impact and
inevitably, often unconsciously and imperceptibly, changes take place.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#107:2>
Not all changes however are for the better.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#108:2>
Colour schemes, dress and decorations have seen some improvement.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#109:2>
With understandable pride Puttashamachar points out that as
master <}> <-> craftman </-> <+> craftsman </+> </}> he was given the award
in 1981 by Karnataka State <indig> Janapada </indig> ( Folk Arts) Akademi,
for the puppets he was creating.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#110:2>
Of the total 40 to 50 puppets used by him in the troupe more than
half were carved by him in recent years. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#111:2>
Old puppets break or split, with constant use and time, and
often repairs are not possible due to the dry state and brittleness of the
wood used, says Achar. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#112:2>
Decreasing interest and indifferent patronage had brought
this folk art to the verge of extinction.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#113:2>
There are about 20 to 25 different troupes in Karnataka with
varying degrees of luck and prosperity.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#114:2>
Some are barely able to survive.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#115:2>
Only a few are successful.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#116:2>
Many more are dormant and often run as amateur efforts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#117:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> FIFTEEN </smallcaps> </bold> years ago <w>
Achar's </w> troupe too had hit the bottom and was nearing closure.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#118:2>
Timely help and encouragement from the Kannada Study Centre of
Mysore University and the Folk Arts Akademi gave it a new lease of life,
Achar recalls. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#119:2>
He is particularly appreciative of Prof. G.S. <w>
Paramashivayya's </w> interest and encouragement.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#120:2>
That a soft spoken, mature and talented person like
Puttashamachar should feel so profusely thankful for a grant <+> of </+>
<indig> Rs. </indig> 5,000 to hold on to the troupe may be an indication of
his humility.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#121:2>
But it is also a telling commentary on the society and so-called
protectors of traditional arts and handicrafts. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#122:2>
A mere <indig> Rs. </indig> 5,000 was all that they thought of
for helping a troupe which provides livelihood for 14 persons, not to speak
of continuing with an activity which is a part of our cultural heritage.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#123:2>
Should the traditional folk arts be reduced to such supplication?
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#124:2>
Puttashamachar has memories of a sponsored visit to Bombay.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#125:2>
At the end, someone was so enamoured by the puppets that he was
asked to leave behind.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#126:2>
Were they compensated adequately?

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#127:2>
<w> Achar's </w> response was silence. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#128:2>
<quote> " What can we do if elders and important people make
such demands?" </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#129:2>
<quote> " They should be grateful that they are given a chance
to perform" </quote> seems to be the attitude of the <quote> 'upper class
of promoters', </quote> whose position of influence can make or mar many a
career.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#130:2>
The <O> photograph on column 2 & 3 </O> <O> captions </O> <O>
photograph oh column 2 & 4 </O> <O> caption </O> <indig> Apna Utsavs </indig>
are a classic example of this.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#131:2>
Incidentally the Belloor troupe had performed at the <indig> Apna
Utsav </indig> in Delhi, where they seem to have caught the eye of some
appreciative French heart, leading to the French connection. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#132:2>
The French went about their choice quite methodically.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#133:2>
The first screening was through a video film.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#134:2>
Before finally selecting, the concerned French persons came
down, went all the way to the village, saw a live performance and only then
made the final selection.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#135:2>
Each of the performance would be of an <w> hour's </w> duration.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#136:2>
It is a highly abridged version of the entire <indig> <it> Ramayana
</it> </indig> encapsulated into an hour-long play.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#137:2>
Over the years, the performers had learnt to trim their all night
performance into a 3-hour play.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#138:2>
But reducing it to one hour might do little justice to their art and
performance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#139:2>
They have to do it jet speed. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#140:2>
The colourful personalities and characters of Ravana,
Shoorpanakha, Khara Dooshana, Thrishira, Jatayu, Vali, Sugriva, Anjaneya,
etc., apart from the main characters of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, have to be
given scope to bring out the essence of <indig> <it> Ramayana </it>
</indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#141:2>
The fights and battles, the mirage of the golden deer and many other
alluring episodes would crowd the one hour narrative, Achar remarks. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#142:2>
<bold> <smallcaps> NEARER </smallcaps> </bold> home the troupe,
like similar others, depends on the patronage of the people.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#143:2>
During festivals and locally important functions like the
<indig> <it> Jathre </it> </indig> , on important religious days like the
Ganesha festival, the troupe is invited to perform. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#144:2>
They travel by bus and train, wherever possible, and even
bullock carts.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#145:2>
Besides the travel fare and food, the payment for one <w> night's
</w> performance can be, and usually is, <indig> Rs. </indig> 1,001.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#146:2>
Occasionally, they are lucky to get two or three thousand <indig>
rupees </indig> .

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#147:2>
The demand is seasonal and very much depends upon the success of
agriculture in a season. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#148:2>
Some of the performers have small holdings of agricultural land
by which they supplement their income.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#149:2>
But to most it is an uncertain vocation.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#150:2>
By being brought to the public gaze on bigger platforms they hope
their fortunes would change for the better due to such exposure and

The all pervading TV influence has affected puppet play too.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#152:2>
With rural areas increasingly coming under TV coverage, the
struggle for survival becomes even more fierce and increasingly an
unequal battle.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#153:2>
With all that, Puttashamachar is not perturbed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#154:2>
His son has already been trained by him and he is confident that
the family tradition would continue.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#155:2>
His troupe members too are keen to continue. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#156:2>
One way out is for the various agencies in different states to
arrange for exchange visits and pay the performers decently.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#157:2>
The middlemen, both individuals and organisations, which are
growing like cancer have to be weeded out.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#158:2>
For cultural expositions abroad <indig> crores </indig> of
<indig> rupees </indig> are spent; much of it allegedly misspent. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#159:2>
A fraction of such bounty can help save folk arts like string
puppetry.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#160:2>
Old artists are not offered even nominal pensions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#161:2>
While able their livelihood is uncertain; old and incapable of work
they are totally ignored. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#162:2>
Organised labour take away all the plums in the country.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#163:2>
Those who carry the cultural tradition live a bleak life and die
even a bleaker death.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#164:2>
Yet crocodile tears are shed for them, when nothing constructive
is done.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#165:2>
By their very environment, lack of education and sophistication
they are easy prey to the exploiters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#166:2>
Organisations like the ICCR and the Akademies at the State level
should play a more active and positive role. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-007#167:2>
<w> Puttashamachar's </w> unswerving loyalty to his centuries
old art is astonishing, as is his faith in fate and hope of better days to
come.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#168:2>
The puppets he holds on strings will have conquered the heart of an
appreciative foreign audience.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#169:2>
The local patrons too might smile and the dawn of a new encouraging
day could be at hand.

<ICE-IND:W2B-007#170:2>
Achar is hopeful that it sure would do so. </p> <*> filled small
