<I> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#1:1:A>
For the introduction <,> very kind of you <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#2:1:A>
A lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly 
uh  
<,> as we noticed <,,> in the infield area 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#3:1:A>
But uh <,,> there is <,> a a little scope left for improvement 
in  
the outfield because that wasn't quite uh <,> a part of football 
occasion  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#4:1:A>
Uhm <,> the toss <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#5:1:A>
Not immediately clear who won but uh <,,> the two captains 
Mohammad  
Azharuddin <,> leading the Indian Eleven <,> and Amir Malik <,,> 
the wicket  
keeper <,,> one of the few experienced <,,> boys in the 
Pakistani Eleven <,,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#6:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#7:1:A>
<w> It's </w> unfortunate that we haven't uh <,> had the  
pleasure of the <,,> to be say final of the Pakistan Eleven <,> 
for this  
match <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#8:1:A>
But there are a number of other matches coming <,> in India and 
of  
course in Sharjah later so that uh <,> a lot of people are 
keeping things in  
reserve <,> can't blame them for that <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#9:1:A>
This after all is <,,> primarily a benefit one-day match <,> and 
the  
two beneficiaries <,,> former Ranjit trophy stars <,> from 
Hyderabad <,>  
Jyotiprasad and Habib Khan <,,> for whom of course this must be 
a very big  
occasion Ravi 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#10:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#11:1:A>
True there is a lot of very good cricket coming up <,> in  
Sharjah <,> back in India and of course down under <,> for a few 
month <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#12:1:A>
The Indian Eleven led by Mohammad Azharuddin <,> Ravi Shastri  
Shrikant will be seen back <,> Dilip Vengasarkar Kapil Dev who 
<,> has <,>  
such a scintillating performance in the past five days 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#13:1:A>
Everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#14:1:A>
Manjrekar and Tendulkar <,> the dynamic duo from Maharashtra 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#15:1:A>
Manoj Prabhakar <,,> Kirmani is back but unfortunately he 
doesn't  
find a place in the <,> Indian twenty-two announced yesterday 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#16:1:A>
Arshad Ayub and Venkatpathi Raju <,,> providing the local <,,>  
flavour <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#17:1:A>
And one of the many fine buildings Hyderabad can <,,> be proud 
of  
Legislative Assembly <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#18:1:A>
So we would be seeing it during the match very often <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#19:1:A>
But here is the Pakistani Eleven <,> led by Amir Malik <}> <-> 
<.>  
wi </.> </-> <=> wicket </=> </}> keeper Jahur Ilahi <,,> young 
brother of  
Mansur <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#20:1:A>
Mansur Rana who happened to be the son of Shakur Rana <,,> one 
of  
the leading umpires of Pakistan 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#21:1:A>
Shahid Saeed <,> Gafar Kazmi <,> Mansur Ilahi another very  
experienced player <,> Suheil Fazal <,> Javed Hayat <,> Zakir 
Khan and Tanvir  
Mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and <,> 
Sajjad <,>  
Akbar <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#22:1:A>
The drop man Mujahir Jamshid <,,> who did very well in the under 
 
nineteen sometime ago <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#23:1:A>
There was some delay in knowing the exact uh <,> content of the 
 
Pakistan Eleven but we are glad that all the players are now 
here though some  
of them have arrived very late 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#24:1:A>
But uh of course <,,> cricket loving public of Hyderabad and of 
 
India in general <,,> are glad that uh <,> the full contingent 
has arrived in  
time <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#25:1:A>
Mansur Ilahi <,> getting a liitle bit of batting in <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#26:1:A>
And uh near at the V I P stand <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#27:1:B>
A lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match  
was held <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#28:1:A>
Ravi I believe Mohammad Azharuddin won the toss and has  
elected to field <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#29:1:A>
So we will see some <,,> Pakistani batting first <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#30:1:A>
Mansur Ilahi would be looking forward to give another 
scintillating  
display <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#31:1:A>
I remember couple of performances in the Middle East where he 
did  
<,> uh exceedingly well some years ago <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#32:1:A>
But uhm <,,> thereafter I think he has been sort of in and out  
really <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#33:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#34:1:A>
So he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium  
pacer because I think one day cricket has given rise to uh <,,> 
to uh <,> an  
increasing number of alrounders <,,> where if you fail with one 
<,> then you  
can certainly try and uh <,> get into the limelight with the 
other <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#35:1:B>
Charu I think 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#36:1:A>
I hear a section of the crowd <,> still picking up actually  
still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a 
a stadium  
<,,> full <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#37:1:A>
Here are the two umpires <,> doing duty for the match <,,>  
Ramaswamy nearer us <,,> and behind him <,> Shivram <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#38:1:A>
The capacity of the stadium is around uh <,> twenty-five 
thousand  
ordinarily but I think it has been uh <,,> bolstered a bit by uh 
<,>  
additional stand <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#39:1:A>
So <,> yes we do have a full house we can expect upto 
thirty-five  
thousand people <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#40:1:A>
Both the teams were earlier introduced to the Chief Minister 
<,,>  
with the chief guest Mr N Janardan Reddy <,,> a very staunch 
supporter of  
sports <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#41:1:A>
And in his uh <,> tenure already we had some very major events 
in  
Hyderabad <,> particularly as you were mentioning earlier Ravi 
the pre-  
olympic football tournament two months ago <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#42:1:A>
And as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete <,>  
face-lift <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#43:1:A>
And <,> the facility is added particularly for the players and 
uh  
<,,> others nearer the pavilion <,,> are now <,,> almost world 
class 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#44:1:A>
Which is very good for any venue really <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#45:1:A>
True and being from Hyderabad I can only add that the A P  
government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the 
finest  
possible facilities <,,> uh have been incorporated into the 
stadium <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#46:1:A>
Which had been languishing for a number of years I think it was 
<,>  
uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout <,> 
and since  
then not much had been done 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#47:1:A>
So the pre-Olympic Football was a big boon for sportslover in  
Hyderabad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#48:1:A>
See because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this 
<,>  
beautiful breeze that you just mentioned I think uh <,> further 
down in the  
ground it may not be uh <,,> particularly heavy at this point of 
time 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#49:1:A>
So it would be very hard <,> through the day 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#50:1:A>
And October is uhm <,> not the coldest month in Hyderabad <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#51:1:A>
It can get awfully hot <,,> but if the cloud cover does take up 
bit  
during the day then in fact in the later half <,> we will get 
better playing  
conditions <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#52:1:B>
True 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#53:1:A>
To remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side  
match <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#54:1:A>
The timings are uh <,,> well nine thirty really but I guess <w> 
 
it's </w> about to begin <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#55:1:A>
There will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will 
 
resume at one fifteen <,> till the end of play <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#56:1:A>
The Indian team taking the field <,> Arshad Ayub at front <,,> 
led  
of course by the captain <,> Azharuddin <,> who had a very 
successful season  
<,> for Derbyshire in the <,> English county cricket league <,,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#57:1:B>
Most of the Summer 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#58:1:A>
No he is a batsman for all seasons I don't think there is any  
search of any occasion were uh <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#59:1:A>
The batting being open for Pakistan by their captain Amir Malik 
 
also very useful opener and to his right <,,> in the green cap 
<,,> a county  
cricket cap <,> Jahur <,> Ilahi who is <w> Mansur's </w> younger 
brother <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#60:1:A>
And to remain <,> in contention for the match <?> fourteen </?> 
at  
this age is really a <,> very fitting tribute to his uh <,,> 
physical prowess  
<,> and of course his speed and effective diving behind the 
wicket but <,>  
like I mentioned earlier its a trifle <,> disappointing <,> in 
one way to not  
see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#61:1:A>
Uhm and I am sure he must be very disappointed particularly <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#62:1:A>
The selection is is <,,> not an easy job at any time and I am 
sure  
the selectors <,> must know what they are doing 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#63:1:B>
<indig> Meri khyal hai </indig> <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#64:1:A>
I think Kirmani is at an age <,> almost <,> where he might  
qualify as a selector <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#65:1:B>
<indig> Jee haan </indig> <,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#66:1:A>
Jahur Ilahi <,,> all set <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#67:1:A>
He will be the non-striker <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#68:1:A>
And to open the innings <,,> Jahur 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#69:1:B>
Amir 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#70:1:A>
Amir Malik beg your pardon <,,> who is also the captain 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#71:1:A>
And <,> to open the Indian bowling <,,> Manoj Prabhakar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#72:1:A>
Only one slip <,,> to begin with <,,> Dilip Vengasarkar <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#73:1:A>
Slightly dangerous way to begin <,,> that edge carrying <,,> 
quite  
safely the second slip <,,> which of course didn't exist <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#74:1:A>
The ball stopped at the boundary <,> by <,,> Kanwaljit Singh 
<,,>  
who is also now a Hyderabad Ranji regular <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#75:1:A>
And two runs to <,,> Amir <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#76:1:A>
Manoj Prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip <,,> 
brings  
one on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#77:1:A>
There we have Kirmani behind the stumps <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#78:1:A>
Vengasarkar as uh <,,> first slip <,,> Venkatpathy Raju being  
brought in <,,> as a second slip <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#79:1:A>
Arshad Ayub <,,> seen here with Manoj Prabhakar <,> Ayub is at 
mid  
off <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#80:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a nice ball <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#81:1:A>
A very useful swing bowler <,> Manoj Prabhakar <,,> particularly 
 
proving himself in Pakistan sometime ago <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#82:1:A>
And a very good run <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#83:1:A>
Another out swinger <,,> all four yes swinging out <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#84:1:A>
Ravi if I am not mistaken I think uh uh <,,> <w> Manoj's </w>  
important weapon is his inswinger <,> which he swing by a yard 
on occasions  
uh <,> in keeping that in a bit of check right now <,,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#85:1:B>
It has been <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#86:1:A>
Yes like on that occasion <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#87:1:A>
Wide of the crease <,,> a little faster action <,,> and quite a 
 
classic inswinger <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#88:1:A>
Of course that one didn't swing too much <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#89:1:A>
That is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any 
 
more <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#90:1:A>
Debut way back eight years ago <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#91:1:A>
End of a useful over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#92:1:A>
A quiet beginning <,,> two run from the board for the Pakistan  
Eleven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#93:1:A>
The two men in for Pakistan <,,> Amir Malik their captain and  
wicket keeper and Jahur Ilahi <,> the younger brother of Mansur 
<,,> who will  
now <,,> take strike against <,> Kapil Dev <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#94:1:A>
I think the media has been full <,> of praise for Kapil <w> 
Dev's  
</w> uh incredible performance in the Irani trophy <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#95:1:A>
Of course it is uh a team game so <,> the whole team should get 
the  
credit but Kapil Dev is bringing out yet another magnificient 
performance  
with the ball <,,> and with the bat <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#96:1:A>
Ravi were you there in Faridabad when this was going on <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#97:1:B>
Yes same as old 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#98:1:A>
And a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh <,> way back  
in the world cup <,,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#99:1:B>
Zimbabwe <,> <indig> unnees sau triyasi </indig> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#100:1:A>
True <{> <[> and we were </[> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#101:1:B>
<[> <indig> Jab Bharat ne vishwa </indig> cup <indig> jeeta  
</indig> </[> </{> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#102:1:A>
We have got some <,,> very low score for five when he went in  
<?> resolute </?> thirty or some such thing 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#103:1:A>
Quite an incredible fight like that 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#104:1:A>
Five for forty-three is his best bowling performance <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#105:1:A>
Thirteen years of International cricket <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#106:1:A>
Now that is a very loose <,> loose enough <,> way down the leg  
side <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#107:1:A>
But even <,,> Kapil Dev uh <,,> can have <,> situations like 
that  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#108:1:A>
Kirmani I think caught by surprise having to <,> try way to his 
 
left <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#109:1:A>
Just about collected the ball <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#110:1:A>
So a wide <,,> one more <,,> to the Pakistani Eleven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#111:1:A>
I think the laces may be <,> to blame them <,> tying them again 
 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#112:1:A>
And Kanwaljit Singh <,,> an offspinner <,> for the Hyderabadi  
Ranji squad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#113:1:A>
For Kapil Dev also two slip <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#114:1:A>
Dilip Vengasarkar <,> maintaining first slip position and <,>  
captain Azharuddin <,> at the second <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#115:1:A>
I think that one was not <,,> a milimetre away from the central 
 
stump <,,> because played well forward so no danger <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#116:1:A>
In the second over <,,> the Pakistani Eleven <,> three for no 
loss  
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#117:1:A>
Back foot into the covers <,,> Shrikant <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#118:1:A>
Jahur Ilahi opens his account <,> with a break <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#119:1:A>
Manoj <,,> at third man <,,> gives only a single <,,> and that  
brings Amir Malik onto the strike <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#120:1:A>
Amir Malik on two <,> Jahur Ilahi <,> on two <,,> one wide <,> 
and  
the total <,> five <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#121:1:A>
I beg your pardon Jahur Ilahi <,,> has three to his credit <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#122:1:A>
A bit of lift on that ball <,,> and Amir <,,> seeing it well in 
 
time let it go through <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#123:1:A>
And Kapil Dev too sort of angling through his first over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#124:1:A>
Two slip <,,> another young Hyderabadi <,,> doing some duty for 
 
the fielding side Noel David <,,> is now brought in <,,> at 
third place <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#125:1:A>
Little change in the fielding Shrikant moved to point <,,> man 
in the covers <,,> Kanwaljit Singh mid on <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#126:1:A>
Down the leg side and Kapil completes his first over <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#127:1:A>
Gentle <,,> nothing spectacular <,,> especially one as a who in 
one <,> is a battle squad thirty-two <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#128:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#129:1:A>
The field for Manoj Prabhakar two slip <,> four men on the  
off side <,> third man point <,> cover and mid off <,,> and 
three men <,> on  
the on <,> mid on <,,> mid wicket <,,> and fine leg <,> 
 
<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#130:1:C>
Oh gone for four <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#131:1:A>
I think Jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a  
bigger swing <,,> but the ball pass straightning up the just a 
bit <,,> and  
catching the off stump <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#132:1:A>
Jahur Ilahi <,,> the first casualty for Pakistan and Ravi here 
it  
is again <,> 
 
<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#133:1:B>
<&> In Hindi </&> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#134:1:A>
Its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere <O> laughter  
</O> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#135:1:A>
But a very good ball <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#136:1:A>
And uh Jahur Ilahi I think more just beaten by the pace <,,> 
very  
quick ball <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#137:1:A>
Next man in <,> Mansur Rana <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#138:1:A>
Its right up <,,> Mansur gets the <?> thirty-sixth </?> outside 
 
edge I don't think that was plan to go but it did <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#139:1:A>
I beg your pardon <w> that's </w> a <,> Gaffar <,> Kazmi <,> we 
 
had Mansur Rana in our list <,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#140:1:A>
So that is Gaffar Kazmi <,,> now at the non-striker end <,,>  
having got in a single off the first ball he played <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#141:1:A>
Amir Malik <,,> minor change in field placing <,> Venkatpathy 
Raju  
being brought in <,,> at third slip <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#142:1:A>
That well guided <,> Kanwaljit is <,,> third man <,,> and Amir  
gets single <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#143:1:A>
<w> That's </w> a real inswinger but uh <,> way out <,> way down 
 
the leg side so not much scope for damage there <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#144:1:A>
But the kind of <,> the the amount of swing that we were talking 
 
about earlier <,> I mean he quite did it <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#145:1:A>
Slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#146:1:A>
Uh <w> that's </w> a crackling drive of the front foot through 
the  
covers <,,> four runs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#147:1:A>
We will have to beg your pardon one more time that is <,,> the  
Pakistani paceman Zakir Khan in the green cap on the left now 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#148:1:A>
Credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the  
Pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not 
exactly their  
regular eleven <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#149:1:A>
But as the match goes on I am sure uh <,,> we will all be far 
more  
comfortable about players <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#150:1:A>
Twelve for one <,,> at the completion of three overs <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#151:1:A>
Kapil Dev coming in again <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#152:1:A>
For him now two slip <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#153:1:A>
Noel David back at point <,,> little point <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#154:1:A>
Amir Malik <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#155:1:A>
Malik picks the quick single <,,> inspite Noel David rushing in 
 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#156:1:A>
Still early in the inning <,> so thats some good understanding 
and  
good running <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#157:1:A>
Thats Noel David <,,> youngster now becoming a teacher in the  
Hyderabad Ranji team <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#158:1:A>
Azharuddin <,,> lot of responsibility <}> <-> in his shoulders  
</-> <,> <=> on his shoulders </=> </}> in the coming months 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#159:1:A>
So far uh <,> declared captain for the Sharjah <,,> and the 
India  
Pak one day series to be held in India <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#160:1:A>

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#161:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#162:1:A>
Zakir Khan <,,> carefully to midoff and I think Zakir will  
get uh <,,> to his own stuff <,,> when they go into ball <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#163:1:A>
One heard a lot about him <}> <-> in <,> in </-> <=> in </=> 
</}>  
uh <,,> for the year having gone by but uh <,,> he hasn't really 
become a  
regular feature <,> of the Pakistani <,> squad so far <,,>

Arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this 
 
match <,>

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#172:1:B>
Yeah <,,> 
 
<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S2A-001#173:1:A>
I think some credit that this match is being held must go to  
Arshad <,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#174:1:A>
In and out of the Indian team for the past few years 
unfortunately  
<,,> particularly for his uh <,> region or fans in Hyderabad 
<,,> 

<ICE-IND:S2A-001#175:1:A>
