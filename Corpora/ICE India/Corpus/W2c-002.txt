<h> Govt policy on metals criticized </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#2:1>
<@PR> NEW DELHI {#}, <@DR> March 7 {#}
 - - The National Council of Applied Economic Research ( NCAER) has said
the stagnation in growth rate of consumption of lead and zinc in the
country was on account of <quote> " frequent fluctuations" </quote> in
government policy. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#3:1>
In its updated study titled <quote> " Market survey for lead, zinc
and cadmium," </quote> which is still under discussion in the council, NCAER
contended that since the mid-1960s <quote> " a perennial foreign exchange
crunch" </quote> had prompted the Government to encourage the substitution
for lead and zinc with a high import dependence by metals in which the
country was relatively self-sufficient. </p> </I>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#14:3>
MUNICIPAL commissioner S S Tinaikar on Wednesday set at rest
speculations over his continuing in office, saying he will not continue
even if asked to, even as the probability of an extension being granted to
the present corporation receded. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#15:3>
Tinaikar told <it> The Independent: </it> <X> <quote> " I
believe every man should pack up and go home after his job is over.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#X16:3>
I, too, shall do the same when my time comes." </quote> </X>

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#17:3>
The commissioner is due to retire at the end of April. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#18:3>
<quote> " I have not been asked to continue, and I am not
going to," </quote> he added. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#19:3>
<X> <quote> " <w> What's </w> the fun in continuing when there
are no Acharyas and Nayaks?" </quote> </X> the civic chief said in a lighter
vein, referring to his frequent clashes with mayor Sharad Acharya and
standing committee chairman Ramdas Nayak. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#20:3>
<X> <quote> " What am I without the 170 corporators?

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#X21:3>
Just another bureaucrat in Mantralaya." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#22:3>
Tinaikar also said that the present corporation had no right
to continue after its tenure expired on March 31.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#23:3>
<X> <quote> " People have given them ( the corporators) a mandate for
five years.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#X24:3>
They have no right to be in office after that." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#25:3>
The <indig> Shiv Sena </indig> , for its part, is doing
everything it can to cling on to power though the final decision rests with
chief minister Sharad Pawar who, understandably, is less inclined to
let his principal political opponents rule the Bombay Municipal
Corporation. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#26:3>
The <indig> <w> Sena's </w> </indig> only hope is that Pawar may
not want the party to gain public sympathy by dissolving the corporation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#27:3>
Acharya has called a meeting of the various group leaders on
Thursday to discuss the matter.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#28:3>
Tinaikar, who has also been invited, said he would not attend the
meeting. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#29:3>
The commissioner felt that the <}> <-> governmennnt </-> <+>
government </+> </}> should invite public opinion before taking a decision
on the fate of the corporation.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#30:3>
But even he was against the idea of an administrator looking after
civic affairs for long period.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#31:3>
<quote> " This could be more dangerous than having a bad
corporation," </quote> he said. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#32:3>
Elaborating, he said that even if the corporation took wrong
decisions, they became public.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#33:3>
But when all the powers were vested with a single person.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#34:3>
there was no accountability. </p> </I>

Services did every thing but score on Wednesday and had to be
content with a goalless draw against Madhya Pradesh in the West Zone Football
Championships for the Santosh Trophy at the Ravi Shankar Shukla Stadium
here. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#39:4>
In the <w> day's </w> earlier match, Goa remained on top of the
six-team pool when they drubbed Rajasthan 5-0. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#40:4>
Madhya Pradesh had an equal share of the exchanges in the opening
session.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#41:4>
Their ace striker Pavitra Kar made two good attempts, but on both
occasions Services goalkeeper B S Negi effected fine saves. </p>

In the second session however, it was Services who called the
tune.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#43:4>
T Parya hit the ball high over the goal with only the keeper at his
mercy, and later his powerful shot from the top of the box was neatly
collected by Habibullah. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#44:4>
M P captain Uttam Dey had the mortification of being shown the
red card midway through the first half.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#45:4>
He needlessly struck T M Rabi from the back when the ball was not in
play and M P had to play the rest of the match with ten men. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2C-002#46:4>
Goa found the target in the fifth minute and never looked back.

<ICE-IND:W2C-002#47:4>
Centre-half Agnelo Miranada opened the scoring when he took
