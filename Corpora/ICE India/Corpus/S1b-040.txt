<ICE-IND:S1B-040#1:1:A>
Another budget <,> another hike <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#2:1:A>
The Railway budget for next year <,> has proposed a ten percent
increase <,> in both passenger fares and freight rate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#3:1:A>
The railways of course <,> justify this increase on the ground <,,>
that <,> their input cost in the last one year have gone up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#4:1:A>
And despite the fact <,,> and despite their efforts <,> to improve
their productivity over last year <,,> they contend that <,> an increase has
become necessary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#5:1:A>
And unless they do this <,> they will not be able to maintain their
<,> operations <,> as also provide resources <,> for fresh investment <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#6:1:A>
Not many of course <,> would share this perception <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#7:1:A>
There would be usual criticism <,> that the great hike will be
inflationary <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#8:1:A>
The cost of production will go up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#9:1:A>
There will be more burden on the consumer <,> as prices of essential
commodities will go up <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#10:1:A>
And of course <,,> the rail traveller would have to shell out <,>
at least ten percent more <,,> for travelling <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#11:1:A>
The budget of course <,> raises <,> a number of issues whether <,>
the hike is justified <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#12:1:A>
Whether the railways can actually <,,> reduce <,,> <}> <-> the the
</-> <=> that </=> </}> prices in tariff <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#13:1:A>
Can they accomodate by improving their effeciency <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#14:1:A>
Are they using their resources efficiently <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#15:1:A>
Are they deploying <,> deploying their funds <,> in the manner <,>
which <,> suits the <,> priorities of the railway <,> and the country at
large <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#16:1:A>
Are the railways investing enough <,> to take care of the growing
needs of the economy <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#17:1:A>
These and <,> similar related issues <,> we will look at <,> in
this discussion today <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#18:1:A>
We have a distinguished panel <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#19:1:A>
And on my right <,> is <,> member traffic <,> of the railway board
<,> Mr Shrivasan <,> Mr A N Shukla <,> chairman railway board <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#20:1:A>
On <}> <-> my <.> le </.> </-> <=> on my left </=> </}> <,> is <,>
Mr K N Thakur <,> former secretary planning commission <,> and <,,> advisor
<,,> a principal advisor to the planning commission <,> and Mr P S Anand <,>
who is the financial commission for the railways <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#21:1:A>
Uh Mr Shukla <}> <-> may I </-> <=> may I </=> </}> begin this
discussion with you <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#22:1:A>
<-> That </-> considering the fact <,> that <,> the rate of
inflation <,> in the last one year has gone down <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#23:1:A>
How do you actually justify <,,> the increase in freight rate <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#24:1:A>
Particularly freight rate because last year <,> when the rate of
price rise was much higher <,,> you had increased <,> rate by seven point
five percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#25:1:A>
This year when the rate of inflation has come down <,> the freight
has gone up by ten percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#26:1:A>
Surely your input cost <,,> <-> the </-> must have gone up by a
much lower percentage <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#27:1:A>
Then how do you explain it <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#28:1:B>
Mr Bharati <,,> the railway finances have traditionally <,,>
been met <,,> from <,> two basic sources <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#29:1:B>
One is <,> the budgetory support <,> which the railways have been
getting from the government <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#30:1:B>
And the other is internal resource generation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#31:1:B>
Over the last four or five years we have added a third force <,>
and that is <,,> the uh <,> sail of bond <,> of the Indian Railway Finance
Corporation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#32:1:B>
So basically these are the three sources that we have available to
us <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#33:1:B>
Now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support <,>
in the fifth five year plan <,,> was of the order of seventy-five percent
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#34:1:B>
This slowly went down to about sixty percent <,> in the sixth plan
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#35:1:B>
And it has been steadly diminishing <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#36:1:B>
We did come up with this <,,> new source that is the railway bond
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#37:1:B>
But unfortunately <,> because of the <,> you know the <,> the
unusual market conditions which have prevailed <,> over the last one year or
so <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#38:1:B>
It was not being possible to sell these bonds <,> although we have
increased the the <,> uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#39:1:B>
But there are just <O> one word </O> to this particular movement
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#40:1:B>
Therefore <,> when the budgetory support is diminishing <,> it was
uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#41:1:B>
And it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in
ninety-three ninety-four <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#42:1:B>
We have no option <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#43:1:B>
But <,,> to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the
necessary infrastructure <,,> for transport <,,> for the country <,> the
industry of the country as a whole to develop <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#44:1:B>
There are no soft option <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#45:1:A>
Mr Shukla you are you are suggesting that <,> uh indirectly
suggesting that <,,> uh the increase in freight rate and passenger fares <,>
is more linked to the fact <,> that budgetory support has gone down <,>
rather <,,> rather than to the fact that your input cost has gone up <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#46:1:A>
Are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations
and the rate in passenger fare increased <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#47:1:B>
No there is a direct link <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#48:1:B>
And <w> I'll </w> give you a very brief account <,> of how our
input cost have gone up <,> over the last one year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#49:1:B>
That is in this this very financial year <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#50:1:B>
The <,> general increase in prices <,> for materials and fuel <,,>
has been up <-> the other </-> for ten percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#51:1:B>
The electric tariff that <w> we've </w> been paying <,> has gone up
as much as sixteen percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#52:1:B>
And staff cost <,,> that the DA uh uh <,> the DA component <,> of
the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#53:1:B>
And of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for
increments <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#54:1:B>
Now if you add all this together <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#55:1:B>
And add to it the fact that we are planning to <,> to increase <,>
the traffic output <,> both in terms of passengers as well as goods <,> by
something like six percent <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#56:1:B>
It would amount to an additional requirement of funds <,> of the
order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#57:1:B>
Now if you give a look at the figures <,,> last <,> this this <w>
year's </w> already working expenses <,> and the proposed ordinary working
expenses for ninety-three ninety-four <,> <w> you'll </w> find that there is
just a thirteen percent increase <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#58:1:B>
Which means that we have a short <,,> some three to four percent
<,,> of the additional cost <,,> by higher productivity <,,> by cost cutting
<,> and by various means

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#59:1:B>
There is another efficiency factor which I would like to mention at
this very point of time <,> that is the operating issue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#60:1:B>
The operating the issue of <,,> the the input cost <,> divided by
the income <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#61:1:B>
In ninety ninety-one <,> this was ninety-two percent <,> and
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#62:1:B>
In ninety-two ninety-three <,> we expect <,,> to get eighty-seven
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#63:1:B>
And our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be <,>
eighty-three percent <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#64:1:B>
So it is a combination of <,,> cost cutting and resource
mobilization <,> whereby we intend to generate the funds that <w> we'll </w>
need <,,> for investing into the <,> transport infrastructure <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#65:1:A>
<}> <-> <.> Mm Mm </.> </-> <=> Mr Thapar </=> </}> <,> would
you <-> do you </-> buy this argument that the railways have done enough to
<,,> cut down their cost <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#66:1:A>
Uh the economic survey <}> <-> of </-> <=> for </=> </}> this year
<,> in fact mentioned <,> that labour productivity <,> in the railways is
very low <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#67:1:A>
And considering that <,,> it accounts for over fifty percent of
their cost of operation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#68:1:A>
Do you think there is hope for making more improvements and
containing <,> the increase in trade and passenger hike <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#69:1:C>
I think Mr Bharati <,> the fundamental question is what Mr
Shukla was mentioning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#70:1:C>
This particular <,,> budget <,,> to my perception marks a
water-shed <,,> so far as the <,> role of the state is concerned in the
development of the infrastructure <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#71:1:C>
It also marks <,> a water-shed <,> so far as the pricing policy is
concerned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#72:1:C>
It appears that the state has <,> forsaken its role <,> for the
development of <,> transport infrastructure <,> and that of the railways <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#73:1:C>
The figures which Mr Shukla mentioned <,> they tell <,> a story <,>
which is very important <,> and which gives a message <,,> that hitherto <,>
what was funded by the state <,,> will now <}> <-> has </-> <=> have </=>
</}> to be funded by an organization <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#74:1:C>
This raises the basic issue <,,> whether the distortions in the
past <,> whether the railways as an instrument of the government <,> will be
able to absorb that <,> and at what cost <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#75:1:A>
<}> <-> Can we </-> <=> can we </=> </}> separate these two
issues <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#76:1:A>
I mean on the one hand you can emphasis the <,,> let us say the
extra budgetary constraint on the railways <,> that is the role of the state
<,> and the link of the central budget <,> and the railway budget <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#77:1:A>
And <,> second the equally important point of efficiency <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#78:1:C>
Now coming to the efficiency <,> <{> <[> uhm <,> uh <,,> it
appears that the rate <,> that the transport output has been increasing <,>
but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#79:1:C>
There is a scope for the improvement <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#80:1:C>
There is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it
will take place over there that is <{> <[> <O> one or two words </O> </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#81:1:A>
<[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#82:1:A>
<[> Could you </[> </{> could you give some specific
suggestion <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#83:1:C>
The railways have to make sure that the technological <,>
upgradation <,> the pace of upgradation has to be accelerated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#84:1:C>
Unfortunately <,> we have hithereto <,> all along concentrated on
<,,> uh calling a particular path <,> and that is <,> we send around the
teams

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#85:1:C>
We <,> we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#86:1:C>
Now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#87:1:C>
By the time we wake up to <,> take up a particular equipment <w>
it's </w> quite likely it has become an <O> one word </O> <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#88:1:A>
But <,> uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency
with modernization <,> it actually poses a dilemma <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#89:1:A>
You cannot modernize unless you get more resources

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#90:1:A>
The railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the
passsenger price <,> and we have to raise freight price if we want us to
modernize <,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#91:1:B>
<O> One word </O> I started at the begining Mr Bharti that
when I mentioned that the state seems to be <?> observing </?> its role <,>
of development of infrastructure

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#92:1:A>
You mean the railway <}> <-> should be <.> continu </.> </->
<=> should continue </=> </}> to be subsidised by the central budget <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#93:1:B>
<w> It's </w> not a question of subsidise <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#94:1:B>
It is a question of state <,> participating in the developmental
activities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#95:1:B>
After all the railways are there <,> to serve the national purpose
<,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#96:1:B>
We also know that there are historical distortions for instance <,>
the uni gauge which <w> we're </w> talking of it is a multigauge of the past
<,> which was built over there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#97:1:B>
We also know that the railway system was developed <,> basically in
the <,,> uh uh pre-nineteen forty-seven period <,> for the export of the
goods by the Britishers from the ports <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#98:1:B>
If you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented
towards the ports <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#99:1:B>
There are no connectors in between <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#100:1:B>
Now <,> at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are
passing through a phase of technological change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#101:1:B>
<w> You're </w> changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#102:1:B>
Now <,> in this particular period <,> if the state <,,> can <,>
say that they are withdrawing themselves <,> and leaving it <-> to the </->
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#103:1:B>
And <w> I'm </w> afraid it will be very short sighted policy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#104:1:B>
And the important thing is <,> what will be the <O> one word </O>
effect of the <,> of this policy on the organization <,> <w> that's </w> a
very important point

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#105:1:B>
And I think we need <+> to </+> be able to talk about it the
impact of that <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#106:1:A>
What is the the railways point of view <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#107:1:A>
Would they like to eliminate all this subsidies <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#108:1:A>
Would they argue that <,> the <,> centre should bear all the
subsidies <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#109:1:A>
How is it affecting their cost of operation <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#110:1:A>
How is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in <,>
uh trade and passenger fare <,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#111:1:D>
You see it is in this context <,> that uh <,> we have been
able to persue <,,> the government <,,> to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies
<,> on some of the commodities <,> on which we have been traditionally giving
subsidies for the last several years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#112:1:D>
There were <-> there was </-> sixteen commodities in which the
subsidies were being given <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#113:1:D>
And this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such
commodities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#114:1:D>
I think that as Mr Thapar just said <,> unless <,,> various means
can be found <,,> to centrally fund <,> the development of the railways <,>
we will have no option <,,> but to resort <,,> to reducing the subsidies <,>
and to plan to generating funds on our own <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#115:1:D>
Of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors
have to be looked at very closely <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#116:1:D>
We are looking at them very firstly <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#117:1:D>
We are trying to improve the effiiciency

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#118:1:D>
I will give you one example <,> our productivity <,> of man power
<,> in terms of <O> one word </O> <,,> which was at around two hundred and
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one <,> today stands at
three hundred and sixty-seven <,> traffic units per employees

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#119:1:D>
That is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the
result <,> of continuous efforts <,> to upgrade the quality of the man power
<,> and <}> <-> to to to </-> <=> to </=> </}> increase the proportion of the
output versus the input <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#120:1:D>
Likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears <,> have been a
major work <,,> of our <,,> not being able to achieve as much <,> as we would
have like to achieve <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#121:1:D>
And we are tackling this <,> on a on a I would say on a mission
basis <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#122:1:A>
Could you could you tell our <,> viewers that what would be
the impact on the price of essentials <,> uh as a result of the withdrawl of
these subsidies <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#123:1:A>
Because you have withdrawn subsidies <,> on uh essential items
like food grains pulses sugar <,> oil <,,> uh what should be the price infact

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#124:1:D>
It has these measures <,> it is it is not as

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#125:1:A>
Why should the common man have to pay more for these

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#126:1:D>
I <w> I'll </w> give you a few examples <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#127:1:D>
For a litre of kerosene oil <,> for for a litre <w> he'll </w>
have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#128:1:D>
That <w> that's </w> total impact <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#129:1:D>
For uh <,,> cement <,,> it is two <indig> rupees </indig> and
twelve <indig> paisa </indig> per sack of fifty kilogram pack <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#130:1:D>
For uh <,,> coal <,,> the increase is three <,> three point three
seven <indig> paisa </indig> per kilogram <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#131:1:D>
Uh tea <,,> eleven <indig> paisa </indig> per kilogram <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#132:1:D>
The the the heaviest impose has been <,> on sugar which is
twenty-one <indig> paisa </indig> per kilogram <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#133:1:D>
Now that is the order of impact that this is going to have <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#134:1:A>
But isn't <{> <[> twenty </[> one <indig> paisa </indig>
pretty substantial <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#135:1:A>
Anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#136:1:D>
<[> On </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#137:1:D>
No but the fact is <,> that sugar has been very heavily
subsidised in terms of transport <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#138:1:D>
Whereas I do not think that who is good as far as the total
compensation is concerned to the consumer <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#139:1:D>
And I do not think that the railway should be called upon <,> to
bear more than their share <,> of subsidising the product <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#140:1:D>
We have been bearing our share <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#141:1:A>
What is the <,> what is the <w> centre's </w> argument <,,>
against uh compensating for these subsidies <,,> ?

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#142:1:D>
No in fact the centre <,> the centre is looking at it very
closely <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#143:1:D>
And <w> I'm </w> hoping that <,> that is the discussion which we
have had with the centre <,> there might be a certain amount of relief
forthcoming <,,> for some of these essential commodities

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#144:1:D>
But that we have to wait and see as to <,> what they are able to
do for us <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#145:1:A>
Mr Anand don't you think that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#146:1:A>
You see we have <,> we have got caught in very vicious circle <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#147:1:A>
You increase frieght rates <,> that pushes up the price of steel
and coal <,,> and petroleum <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#148:1:A>
And prices <,> when prices of these goods go up <,> you have <w>
you're </w> compel to increase uh your prices of weight <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#149:1:A>
And this keeps on happening year after year <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#150:1:A>
And we have actually witness them in last two <,> in last two
years <,> this inter linkage between <,,> administered prices <,> that when
one price is increased everything else goes up <,> and a chain reaction
follow <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#151:1:A>
So don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten
percent <,> you are not harming the cause of the economy <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-040#152:1:A>
<-> That </-> could you not have made some effort to really
restrain these price increase <,> ?

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-040#153:1:E>
Actually the freight increase contribute very little to the
price rise <,,> </I>
