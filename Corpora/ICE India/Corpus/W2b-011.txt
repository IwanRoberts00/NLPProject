<bold> The determined efforts of American lawmakers and judges,
backed by public opinion and the media, have secured justice and equality for
minorities in the United States. </bold> </&> <*> bold line below </*> <&>
column one </&>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#6:1>
The word <quote> " minorities" </quote> nowhere occurs in the
United States Constitution.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#7:1>
When it was enacted 200 years ago, the concept did not figure in the
reckoning of the Founding Fathers.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#8:1>
It is a tribute to the United States Supreme Court and the United
States Congress that the Constitution has been adapted with remarkable
success to protecting minority rights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#9:1>
Neither, however, could have accomplished much without the
backing of public opinion and the support of the media.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#10:1>
Awareness of minority rights is a fact of American life today.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#11:1>
On February 7 last year, while the Gulf war was raging in fierce
intensity, General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - -
and the first black to hold this position - - was asked about the role of
minorities in the U.S. Army when he testified before the House Armed Services
Committee.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#12:1>
The General lauded the opportunities afforded to minorities in the
military but did not stop there.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#13:1>
He said with typical American candor, " I wish that there were other
activities in our society and in our nation that were as open as the military
is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them in."

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#14:1>
No society in the world can afford to be complacent about its record
on reconciling the diverse interests of a pluralistic society.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#15:1>
Acknowledgment of imperfection is proof of integrity and maturity.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#16:1>
In the past three decades, the U.S. Congress has enacted
several laws to protect the rights of minorities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#17:1>
The most recent of these is the Civil Rights Bill of 1991, which,
according to the <it> Congressional Quarterly </it> , <quote> " seeks to
broaden the reach and remedies" </quote> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
most comprehensive piece of legislation on the subject in the century. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#18:1>
Proposals for that landmark law were submitted to Congress by
President John F. Kennedy in June 1963, a few months before his
assassination.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#19:1>
Only the ardor and political skills of his successor, President
Lyndon Johnson, could have secured their enactment the next year. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#20:1>
The provisions of this statute are of abiding relevance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#21:1>
Title II is the heart of the Act.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#22:1>
It declared all persons to be entitled to <quote> " the full and
equal enjoyment" </quote> of the facilities of <quote> " places of public
accommodation," </quote> such as inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, motion
picture houses, theaters, concert halls, and sports arenas, <quote> " without
discrimination or segregation on the grounds of race, color, religion, or
national origin." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#23:1>
These guarantees were applicable to any establisment if it
<quote> " affects commerce or if discrimination is supported by state
action." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#24:1>
This last was said to be present if discrimination was carried on
under color of law, was required by local custom or usage enforced by state
officials, or was required by the state itself. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#25:1>
Other provisions of the law range over a wide variety of civil
rights problems.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#26:1>
Title III authorized the attorney general to file suits to compel
desegregation of public facilities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#27:1>
Title IV required the commissioner of education to conduct a survey
of the lack of availability of equal educational facilities because of race,
color, religion, or national origin and also authorized him to <quote> "
render school baords technical assistance" </quote> in preparing the
desegregation plants.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#28:1>
It also authorized the attorney general on complaint to institute
suits to desegregate public schools. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#29:1>
Title V empowered the Civil Rights Commission to investigate all
situations where citizens are deprived of the equal protection of the laws
because of race, <O> <&> page </&> 15 </O> color, religion, or national
origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#30:1>
Title VI prohibited discrimination in any program receiving federal
financial assistance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#31:1>
Title VII created a five-man Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, banned discrimination in employment on account of race, color,
religion, or national origin by employers, labor unions, and employment
agencies; and gave the new commission power to enforce the law through
investigations, hearings, and civil actions.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#32:1>
Title X established the Community Relations Service to assist
communities in resolving <quote> " disputes, disagreements, or difficulties"
</quote> relating to discriminatory practices. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#33:1>
One area of weakness in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was its
Title I provision on voting rights.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#34:1>
While race, color, religion, or national origin could not lead to
disenfranchisement, literacy tests and other devices had been used for years
to disqualify blacks and other minorities as voters.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#35:1>
Title I incorporated a few measures <quote> " to provide more
effective enforcement of the right to voice in Federal elections without
regard to race or color," </quote> but this accomplished little more than the
acts of 1957 and 1960.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#36:1>
According to Chief Justice Earl Warren, the ineffectiveness of these
laws stemmed from the fact that they tried <quote> " to cope with the problem
by facilitating case-by-case litigation against voting
discrimination." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#37:1>
Writes Bernard Schwartz in <it> <mention> Statutory History of the
United States: </mention> </it> <quote> " Individual law suits could scarcely
resdolve the problem presented by a system of mass discrimination <*> dotted
line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#38:1>
By 1965 only 71 cases had been filed by the Department of Justice
<*> dotted line</*>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#39:1>
A new and more drastic congressional approach was demanded." </quote>
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#40:1>
On March 15, 1965, President Johnson, in an address to a joint
session of Congress, urged for new legislation to secure the right to vote
for minorities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#41:1>
Two days later the Administration presented a bill to Congress.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#42:1>
After relatively quick discussions in the Senate, the Judiciary
Committee, and the House, the bill was approved and signed by early August.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#43:1>
According to Schwartz, it is <quote> " in many ways, the most drastic
civil rights statute enacted by Congress." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#44:1>
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did away with <quote> " any test or
device as a prerequisite for registration or voting." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#45:1>
Its effect was dramatic, as evidenced by the sharp rise in the
registration of black voters in just two years - - for instance, from 27
percent to 53 percent in Georgia, 19 percent to 52 percent in Alabama, and
seven percent to 60 percent in Mississippi. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#46:1>
The next landmark act came three years later.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#47:1>
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 outlawed discrimination in the sale or
rental of all housing - - and not just in public or public-aided housing - -
because of race, color, religion, or national origin.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#48:1>
The 1960s thus ended with significant statutory gains for the civil
rights movement. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#49:1>
The famous American historian, Henry Steele Commager, had
published a series of his lectures in 1943 under the title <it> <mention>
Majority Rule and Minority Rights </mention> </it> ( Oxford University
Press ) .

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#50:1>
The lectures did not deal with minority rights as we now know them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#51:1>
They dealt with majority rule and limited government and the
perennial theme of judicial review in a democracy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#52:1>
But it is precisely from this outlook, which he so eloquently
articulated, that concern for minority rights has grown.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#53:1>
No majority - - whether of opinion, religion, or other - - can
have absolute power.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#54:1>
Absoluteness belongs to certain values.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#55:1>
Even so, at times competing values do clash.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#56:1>
That is where the judiciary comes in.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#57:1>
The courts had made small but significant attempts at protecting
minority rights by citing older legislation - - the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution that, respectively,
abolished slavery, confirmed citizenship rights on <quote> " all persons born
or naturalized in the United States," </quote> and declared that race was no
bar to voting rights. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#58:1>
Perhaps the most effective provision was the guarantee of
equality in the Fourteenth Amendment: <quote> " Nor shall any state <*>
dotted line</*> deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#59:1>
As former U.S. Solicitor General Archibald Cox recalls, <quote> " The
Supreme Court decisions under the equal protection clause halted hostile
governmental discrimination against blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic
minorities." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#60:1>
The clause provided the legal basis.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#61:1>
The supreme <w> Court's </w> creativity did the rest.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#62:1>
Cox described its impact graphically; <quote> " At the same time that
the <w> Court's </w> sense of responsibility for individuals and
minorities was growing, losers in the political process were becoming more
conscious of the potentials of constitutional adjudication for achieving
goals not attainable through the political process, and they were also
becoming better equipped to use them.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#63:1>
Constitutional litigation came to be conducted more and more by civil
rights and civil liberties organizations, by radical political associations,
and later by law offices funded to stimulate community action and provide
legal services to the poor." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#64:1>
The letter of the Constitution had not changed but new life was
put into the language in the light of the conditions of the times.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#65:1>
This is the essence of judicial statesmanship. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#66:1>
The doctrine of <quote> " State action" </quote> propounded by
the Supreme Court proved handy.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#67:1>
Technically, it means action by State organs - - executive,
legislative, or judicial - - as opposed to private action.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#68:1>
The doctrine, however, his even private action where some State aid,
use of State facilities, or any State sanction was involved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#69:1>
The exclusionary policies of private clubs were hit by the courts
though congressional legislation did not cover them. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#70:1>
The <w> Court's </w> rulings over the years are a fascinating
story in themselves.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#71:1>
The <w> Court's </w> ruling in <it> Brown v. Board of Education </it>
in 1954 outlawing racial segregation in schools, needs no recounting
today. </p> <O> <&> page </&> 16 </O>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#72:1>
With the <it> <mention> Bakke </mention> </it> case ( <it>
<mention> Regents of the University of Califormia v. Bakke </it> </mention> )
the Court entered, in 1978, the new and highly controversial field of <quote> "
affirmative action." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#73:1>
It disallowed ( five to four ) the kind of explicit, rigid racial
quota established by the university but upheld ( five to four ) the use of
race as a tool of affirmative action programs.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#74:1>
The majority ruling left intact the bulk of affirmative action
programs that gave special consideration to minority groups and women
while sounding an alarm on rigid quotas.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#75:1>
Justice Lewis F. Powell cast the decisive vote breaking a four -
four deadlock among the eight other justices.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#76:1>
The Court ruled that a university has a <quote> " substantial
interest" </quote> in a diverse student body that <quote> " legitimately may
be served by a properly devised admission programme involving competitive
considerations of race and ethnic origin." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#77:1>
Earlier, in 1971, the Supreme Court had ruled in <it> <mention>
Griggs v. Duke Power and Co. </mention> </it> that <quote> " discriminatory
preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what
Congress has proscribed.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#78:1>
What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,
arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers
operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other
impermissible classification." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#79:1>
Obviously, this may sometimes require preference to minorities to
overcome handicaps or to correct past wrongs. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#80:1>
Thus the <it> <mention> Bakke </mention> </it> ruling did not
come all of a sudden.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#81:1>
It had been in the making for some time.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#82:1>
In 1977, for example, in <it> <mention> United Jewish Organizations
v. Carey </mention> </it> , the Supreme Court upheld a New York statute
that <quote> " deliberately increased the non-white majorities in certain
districts in order to enhance the opportunity for election of nonwhite
representatives from those districts," </quote> even if it disadvantaged
certain white Jewish communities.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#83:1>
Three members of the Court, including Justice William H. Rehnquist,
who is now the Chief Justice, explained that <quote> " no racial slur or
stigma with respect to white or any other race" </quote> was involved.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#84:1>
In 1979, after Bakke, in <it> <mention> United Steel Workers of
America v. Weber </mention> </it> , a five to two majority held that
private employers could set up a quota system with separate lists for
selecting trainees for a newly created craft program.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#85:1>
In <it> <mention> Fullilove v. Klutznick </mention> </it> six members
of the Court led by then Chief Justice Warren E. Burger unequivocally upheld
a law that reserved ten percent of federal public works programs for
minority contractors. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#86:1>
This case, decided on July 2, 1980, is of seminal importance.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#87:1>
Section 103(6)(2) of the Public Works Employment Act, 1977, provided
that no federal grant would be made for any local public works project unless
the applicant gave <quote> " satisfactory assurance" </quote> that at least
ten percent of the amount of each grant <quote> " shall be expended for
minority business enterprises ( MBE)." </quote>

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#88:1>
The expression was defined to mean a business of which at least 50
percent was owned by minority group members or, in the case of publicly owned
business, at least 51 percent was so owned.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#89:1>
The minority groups were also specified by the provision - - American
citizens who were <quote> " Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, [
American ] Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts." </quote> </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2B-011#90:1>
The Supreme court upheld this law six to three.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#91:1>
Chief Justice Burger, delivering the judgment of the Court, observed:
<quote> " Congress had bofore it, among other data, evidence of a long
history of marked disparity in the percentage of public contracts awarded
to minority business enterprises.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#92:1>
This disparity was considered to result not from any lack of capable
and qualified minority businesses, but from the existence and maintenance of
barriers to competitive access which had their roots in racial and ethnic
discrimination, and which continue today, even absent any intentional
discrimination or other unlawful conduct.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#93:1>
Although much of this history related to the experience of
minority business in the area of federal procurement, there was direct
evidence before the Congress that this pattern of disadvantage and
discrimination existed with respect of State and local construction
contracting as well.

<ICE-IND:W2B-011#94:1>
In relation to the MBE provision, Congress acted within its
competence to determine that the problem was national in scope." </quote>
