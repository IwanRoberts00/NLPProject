<w> St's </w> college from Madras university <,,> and yet <,>
still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#2:1:C>
I am Padma doing my <,,> Ph D here <,,> in literature teaching
<,,>

<$D>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#4:1:E>
I am Subalakshmi doing PGM here <,,>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#5:1:B>
I am Swarnalatha doing by MA in English literature <,,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#6:1:F>
I am Ramkumar doing my M Phil in English literature <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#7:1:G>
I am Louis doing my MA here <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#8:1:A>
Well we have decided to talk <,> uh on <w> women's </w>
liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#9:1:A>
What do you think of <w> women's </w> liberation Louis <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#10:1:G>
<w> Women's </w> liberation is basically uh <,,> a noble
concept but <,,> but the whole question is <,,> the ball is actually in the
<w> women's </w> court I would say <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#11:1:G>
If <,> I think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they
are now <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#12:1:G>
And <,> I think they are allowing themselves to be <,> more
conditioned than <,,> it is more that they condition themselves then <,,> men
conditioning them <,,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#13:1:C>
I object to what Louis said <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#14:1:C>
No doubt question of the woman being conditioned <,> the society
which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give <,> a woman a
chance to <,,> prove her <,> abilities <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#15:1:C>
She sort of <,> repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate
herself <}> <-> is met </-> <=> is met </=> </}> with strong disapproval <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#16:1:C>
So I think the ball is in the <w> men's </w> court because <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#17:1:D>
No but somehow I think you are <,> contradicting yourself in
some ways <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#18:1:D>
Uh as you said <,> <w> it's </w> not actually men or women <,> <w>
that's </w> not the question at all

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#19:1:D>
You yourself said that it is the society that controls

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#20:1:D>
Society made both men and women <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#21:1:D>
So uhn <,,> I think we when we talk of <w> women's </w> liberation
we immediately <,> the association is that it is anti-men <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#22:1:D>
Uh I would like to question that definition first <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#23:1:C>
No but India is mostly a <,> patriarchal society

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#24:1:C>
So <w> it's </w> men who play a more important role right <,> in
all your decision making and <,> what about this <,> however modern we may
get to but still the same <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#25:1:C>
We haven't broken up from our ancient roots <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#26:1:C>
<w> That's </w> what we call <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#27:1:G>
I would like to object to the first statement that she made
<,> that society conditions a woman <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#28:1:G>
I don't belive in society as such

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#29:1:G>
I think the individual is superior to society <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#30:1:G>
I don't understand why <,> uh individual should allow society to
dominate over his <,> his or her individuality <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#31:1:G>
So the question of <w> women's </w> liberation is not that <,>
society suppresses a woman <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#32:1:G>
It is just that the woman <,,> refuses to <,> do anything <,> that
could alleviate her suffering <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#33:1:D>
I think the speaker is talking about <,> about an utopian
society <,> which can never exists <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#34:1:D>
Because the individual is very much a part of the society

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#35:1:D>
He can't alleviate himself from the society <,>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#36:1:C>
What I feel is <,> only the education and the <,> economical
status makes a woman to feel very liberated <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#37:1:C>
So <,> every woman must be educated and must be employed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#38:1:C>
Then only they can be <,> free <,,> taking decisions

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#39:1:C>
Economically they will feel so <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#40:1:A>
What do you feel about it <,,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#41:1:E>
Well I feel <,> uh now uh we have <,> been given equal chances
with men <,> and uh almost in all <,> uh position even women are <,,> have
been working <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#42:1:E>
I mean only thing we have to utilise the <,,> chances properly and
<,,> get into proper positions and make <,> woman come up somewhere

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#43:1:E>
Educate them basically and then <,> make them also <,> come up and
<,,> be one with <,,> men <,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#44:1:F>
I <,> totally disagree that the women they are not taking up
any initiatives <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#45:1:F>
See for the last two or three decades as <,> or so <,> we find that
women <,> <w> they've </w> reached <,,> a real good status to over the men
<,> in each and every field that they have participated <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#46:1:F>
Say now <,> we find <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> women they
are <,> given a voice <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#47:1:F>
They are given a platform <,> rather to voice their own opinions
<,> in each and every field <,> be in press <,,> be in writing fiction <,>
writing poetry they have come up <,> in a great way

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#48:1:G>
But don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#49:1:G>
How many women assert themselves <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#50:1:G>
If you take an average Indian woman <,> you take an average Indian
woman I think the Indian woman <,> does not think <,> more than <,> marriage
and settling down in life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#51:1:G>
An Indian <w> women's </w> ultimate objective in life is to marry
and settle down

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#52:1:G>
<}> <-> You take </-> <=> you take </=> </}> an educated Indian
woman <,> in a Indian society

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#53:1:G>
She might have done her MA or Ph D <,> but what is ultimate
objective <,> she wants to get married <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#54:1:G>
This marriage is the ultimate ideal of society <,> or an individual

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#55:1:G>
It cannot be <,> this

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#56:1:C>
No <{1> <[1> but marriage is just a </[1> part of <,> uh life
you know but when <w> we're </w> getting ourselves educated there is no point
sitting at home as such doing <w> Ph D's </w> and all that <,> <{2> <[2> hey
you can just sit with your BA or </[2>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#57:1:D>
<[1> No that is not the opinion of </[1> </{1>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#58:1:G>
<[2> <w> That's </w> what <w> I'm </w> saying <w> it's </w>
more an exception </[2> </{2> than a rule <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#59:1:G>
It is more an exception than a rule <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#60:1:G>
Perhaps <,> a few of you who are doing a Ph D think that way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#61:1:G>
How many <,,> come to the MA classes by the way <,,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#62:1:F>
No no this is the situation <{> <[> I mean <w> it's </w> bad
</[> <,> but the situation seems to <,> have taken a change <,,> over the
past

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#63:1:G>
<[> I challege that </[> </{>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#64:1:G>
<w> They've </w> but <,> far to <,> far to gradual to <,> have
any <,> any impact on society

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#65:1:F>
But I still feel that there is a percent of change <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#66:1:F>
As she said <,,> <w> our's </w> is a patriarchal society and <,> to
move away from the patriarchal society <,,> it takes some time

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#67:1:D>
<w> It's </w> not so easy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#68:1:D>
Exuse me <,> you are talking about marriage <w> it's </w> necessary
you do <,> because there is no <.> sec </.> security for a single woman <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#69:1:D>
She is not respected <w> that's </w> a fact

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#70:1:A>
No but I <{> <[> think his point was </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#71:1:F>
<[> I <w> I'm </w> not <w> I'm </w> </[> </{> not advocating
<,> uh <w> I'm </w> not advocating a woman being a spinster okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#72:1:F>
<w> You've </w> got me wrong <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#73:1:F>
I am not trying to say that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#74:1:F>
But what <w> I'm </w> I am only taking the exception to a <w>
woman's </w> ultimate objective being marriage <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#75:1:A>
That is wicked of the society <,> <w> that's </w> what <w>
I've </w> been trying to tell you

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#76:1:D>
No but I have one question to <{> <[> ask <,> what is you </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#77:1:F>
<[> Why should it be </[> <,> why should it be <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#78:1:F>
You you have been educated <,,> you should learn to be independent

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#79:1:A>
Now one second <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#80:1:A>
But who gives that kind of notion that <w> that's </w> going to be
your objective <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#81:1:A>
<w> It's </w> a mother <w> it's </w> a father <w> it's </w> a
brother at home

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#82:1:D>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#83:1:A>
Or you know you you are taught even when a child is born <,>
look at all that the advertising that we listen to <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#84:1:A>
The bank says you save <,> save money for your <w> son's </w>
education <,> and save for your <w> daughter's </w> <{> <[> marriage </[>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#85:1:C>
<[> Marriage </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#86:1:F>
You are talking <,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#87:1:D>
So its there

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#88:1:F>
You you are talking <,> <w> you're </w> talking of
conditioning of a person okay <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#89:1:F>
A person an <.> ess </.> essential an individual

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#90:1:F>
An individual should assert himself

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#91:1:D>
No that as you say is a very utopian concept

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#92:1:F>
No no I <{> <[> I strongly disagree </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#93:1:D>
<[> Because an individual can not exist </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#94:1:F>
Please do not dismiss it as a utopian <,> I strongly disgree
with that view <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#95:1:F>
It is not utopian

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#96:1:F>
<w> It's </w> very much practical <,> only we refuse to be
practical <,> that is all

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#97:1:D>
What you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look
at her objective point of her

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#98:1:F>
I am not <,> <w> I'm </w> not being objective <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#99:1:A>
Good going <,> I think <w> we'll </w> have a change in the
topic now <,> uh we will talk of the examination system <,,> uh to which all
of us are agreed to <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#100:1:A>
Yes why don't you begin <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#101:1:D>
Exam system what do you feel that <,,> uh you are getting
your rights <,,> the exam present kind of exams

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#102:1:C>
No <w> ma'am </w> I feel <,> examination should be abolished
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#103:1:C>
I mean at specially at your <,,> graduate under graduate level <,>
post graduate level <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#104:1:C>
I mean they don't help the students in any way <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#105:1:C>
Infact they sort of hamper the <,,> pleasure one <,,> receives
from learning <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#106:1:C>
You don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#107:1:C>
So it should be done away

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#108:1:D>
Does everyone subscribe to this view

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#109:1:D>
What would you like to say Ramkumar

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#110:1:F>
No what I still feel is <,> there should be <,> some way in
which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the
students

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#111:1:F>
And one good way is examination <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#112:1:F>
But what I still feel is <,> the continuous assessment system <,>
will work out <,> in a better way rather than having a three hour examination
<,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#113:1:D>
Yeah <,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#114:1:F>
Say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students
<,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#115:1:G>
No don't you think <,> uh that <,,> the question of a teacher
<,> gauging a students performance <,> is utilatarian <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#116:1:G>
That is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge
<,>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#117:1:F>
No not at all <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#118:1:F>
How do you claim

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#119:1:G>
Why why do you want to gauge a students performence <,>
students knowledge you learn <{> <[> <O> a few words </O> </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#120:1:F>
<[> <O> A few words </O> </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#121:1:F>
<w> You've </w> to place a student <,,> <}> <-> where </-> <=>
where </=> </}> he stands <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#122:1:F>
<w> That's </w> equally important because <{> <[> at the higher
studies </[>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#123:1:G>
<[> As I feel </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#124:1:G>
As I feel <,> that is what I am saying it is a highly utilatarian
concept

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#125:1:G>
You want to test the students so that you know <,> whether you sit
for this whether you sit for this whether you <{> <[> sit for this </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#126:1:A>
<[> <w> That's </w> it </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#127:1:F>
Whether he is qualified for any promotion or not <,> will
have to be determined by the lecturer <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#128:1:F>
Listen <{> <[> examinations don't </[> <,> don't <,> examinations
really do not <,> uh speak of their real ability as such <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#129:1:F>
Your abilities are quite different from what you <{> <[> something
that you take for harassment </[>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#130:1:D>
<[> Well I am </[> </{>

<$CH> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#131:1:C>
<[> <w> That's </w> about the evaluation system </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#132:1:F>
Yes one shade of the ability is <,> that the lecturers <,,>
they test <,> when <,> they evaluate the students <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#133:1:A>
<{> <[> What you know is from the nature </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#134:1:C>
<[> Whether from a guide </[> </{> simply use it

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#135:1:C>
He may not <{> <[> really get the spirit of </[>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#136:1:G>
<[> <w> That's </w> not I mean to say </[> </{>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#137:1:G>
The continuous assessment system <,> is far better of than having
an examination <,> at the end of the year <,> or at the end of couple of
years

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#138:1:E>
No no <{> <[> there so many problems </[> in continuous
assessment that have come out now

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#139:1:C>
<[> Even if the </[> </{>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#140:1:E>
I don't think students really feel confident <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#141:1:E>
<w> It's </w> again putting them into a kind of <,,> uh modern
slavery to <,> the department concerned <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#142:1:E>
And that has also been <,> uh pointed out by many <,> <{> <[> and
not every teacher can be really made objective </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#143:1:F>
<[> No what I really wanted is to make the </[> </{>
objective elements of the teacher comes into play then <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#144:1:F>
But what I still feel is <,> <w> you've </w> different means and
methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#145:1:F>
You can <,,> say introduce a seminar pattern <,> the panel
discussion <,> group discussion <,> ask the students speak out in class <,>
regularly <,,> and then assess the student <,> instead of asking him to sit
for a three hours examination <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#146:1:F>
And then assess him <,> on that <{> <[> basis </[>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#147:1:E>
<[> Yeah </[> </{> in comparision yes

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#148:1:F>
In comparision yes <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#149:1:E>
No but <,> uh when you are <,> taking a seminar or something
like that no one or two students from the class only <,> uh read <,> the
others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#150:1:F>
No he should have been given a topic <{> <[> to the before
the class </[>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#151:1:E>
<[> I mean but when you are asked </[> </{> I mean when you
are asked to write an exam all of us have to write

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#152:1:F>
No each one of the student <,,> is asked to <{> <[> present a
paper </[>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#153:1:E>
<[> Should be given </[> </{> then

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#154:1:F>
Yeah obviously <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#155:1:F>
But then we have other <,> uh difficulties as well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#156:1:F>
Say the class strength is <,> massive <,> you can't <,> uh expect
each and every student to present in a seminar <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#157:1:F>
Or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#158:1:F>
Especially in general English classes where the strength <,> is
over seventy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#159:1:F>
So the case is <,> whether examination should be conducted at all
<,> or they shouldn't be conducted at all <,,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#160:1:G>
Now I suppose <w> we've </w> boiled down to <,> that level

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#161:1:A>
No <w> that's </w> a basic question

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#162:1:A>
But ultimately in practice I think it is used more as a screening
<,> for employer <,> to select

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#163:1:A>
You know they give prescribe qualifications <,,> and <,> that
provide the kind of uh screening for them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#164:1:A>
Know some kind of <,> uh proof that they have selected somebody
with certain <,> certain qualification

<$C> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#165:1:C>
Yeah its very

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#166:1:A>
Whether that qualification really <,> uh matters <,> and
whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not
all

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#167:1:F>
Yeah only for government <,> <&> coughs </&> employment <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#168:1:F>
But when you go to the <.> pr </.> private sector <,> it so
happens that <,> they have their own means and methods of testing the
students <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#169:1:F>
See normally <,,> they take for example if <w> it's </w> going to
be a <w> salesman's </w> job <,> what they do is <,> they have a group
discussion <,> they have an interview

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#170:1:D>
No even then <,> there is a basic qualification

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#171:1:F>
Basic qualification is always there <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#172:1:F>
Some where somehow somewhere <w> you'll </w> have to <,> <{> <[>
scren <,> screen test <,,>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#173:1:D>
<[> Screen </[> </{>

<$D> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#174:1:D>
But do we always feel that uh <,> you know uh we are a mixed
ability group normally in the classroom <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#175:1:D>
Uh with different backgrounds and all <,> all that

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#176:1:D>
<w> I've </w> always felt that uh <,> the differentiation between
a mediocre student and a <,,> good student never really emerges <,> from the
system that we have at present <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#177:1:D>
You now the <.> ma </.> it is very marginal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#178:1:D>
The difference is very marginal <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#179:1:D>
I don't know how uh <{> <[> you react to it </[>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#180:1:F>
<[> <w> It's </w> a maybe </[> </{> <w> we're </w> more
interested in having a national syllabus

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#181:1:F>
And merging each and every <,,> type of institution into one <,>
like the CD CIS Tamil Nadu state

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#182:1:G>
No that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't
accept that <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#183:1:G>
That is <,> that is something very <,>

<$E> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#184:1:E>
Rigid <,>

<$G> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#185:1:G>
Yeah <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#186:1:G>
You can't structuralise something and say <,> you compartmentalise
<,> you can't compartmenatalise knowledge <,> <w> it's </w> unethical

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#187:1:G>
Because you don't <{> <[> give license </[> no you don't give <,>
give a student access to other <,> branches of knowledge when you
compartmentalise knowledge

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#188:1:F>
<[> Give license </[> </{>

<$F> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#189:1:F>
This is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say
is that <,> see <w> we've </w> different systems <,> as the central board of
secondary education ICSE <,> then <w> we've </w> the state board

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#190:1:F>
Each and every <,> state having its own uh <,> curricular <,> like
you know or syllabi <,>

<ICE-IND:S1A-011#191:1:F>
Now once you merge <,,> have <,,> one syllabus <,,> for each and
<,> for every student <,,> who studies in India <,> then may be we were in
better position to evaluate students performence <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1A-011#192:1:A>
No but Ramkumar what <,> what you find in the syllabus is not
a guarantee to what is done in the classroom <,> </I>
