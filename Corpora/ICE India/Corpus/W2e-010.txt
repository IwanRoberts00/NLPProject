<h> <bold> Cost-plus Railways </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#2:1>
IT IS ASTONISHING that within a fortnight of the release of the
Status Paper on Indian Railways, the Union Minister of Railways, Mr. George
Fernandes, has come out with budget proposals for a hefty Rs. 892 <indig>
crore </indig> from higher freight and passenger charges.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#3:1>
The additional revenue to be raised in 1990-91 will be the largest
ever in a year, exceeding the Rs. <indig> 876-crore </indig> increase in the
current financial year.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#4:1>
And while the former Union Minister of Railways, Mr. Madhavrao
Scindia, left passenger fares untouched, Mr. Fernandes has spared no class of
railway users.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#5:1>
The status paper was meant to generate a debate on the ways and means
by which the Railways could meet future demand for services.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#6:1>
Yet, with the focus on higher rates in the Railway budget, Mr.
Fernandes seems to have already decided that there is only one way by which
additional services can be provided.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#7:1>
In retrospect, it now appears that the status paper with its emphasis
on declining budgetary support for Plan investment, the burden of interest
commitments to the exchequer and the cost of maintaining uneconomic routes,
was only preparing the case for a substantial rise in railway rates.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#8:1>
There is no denying that despite vastly improved functioning and
substantial increases in both freight and passenger rates during the 1980s,
the Railways continues to be short of funds for modernisation and track
extension.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#9:1>
The Plan outlay for 1990-91 has been raised to Rs. 5,000 <indig> crore
</indig> , from Rs. 4,450 <indig> crore </indig> in 1989-90.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#10:1>
But this is substantially short of the average annual investment of
Rs. 7,300 <indig> crore </indig> that the Railways has projected as its
requirement during the Eighth Plan. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#11:1>
However, notwithstanding all the arguments in favour of ( almost)
yearly increases in rail charges, two crucial issues have been swept under
the carpet.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#12:1>
Has the Railways done all it can to improve the cost efficiency of
operation so that at least a part of resource requirements can be met without
recourse to higher user charges?

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#13:1>
And, is the present system of raising freight rates in conformity
with recommendations of earlier tariff commissions?

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#14:1>
The answer in both cases is in the negative.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#15:1>
Higher productivity in terms of better wagon and track utilisation
was achieved during the 1980s, but this was not without corresponding
increase in operating costs.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#16:1>
As for the manner of increasing freight rates, successive ad-hoc
increases ( including in this <w> year's </w> budget) have not been in line
with the recommendations of the 1980-81 committee on this subject, especially
with respect to the principle of what the traffic can bear.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#17:1>
In such a situation there is little point in appointing a new tariff
committee as announced by Mr. Fernandes.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#18:1>
The innovation introduced this time of a lower freight rate
between April and September will hardly encourage shippers to use the
Railways.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#19:1>
The trend of a shift towards road transport will continue with only
the transporters of bulk goods using rail transport because they have little
choice.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#20:1>
Since commodities like coal, pig iron and cement are critical inputs
for infrastructural industries, higher transportation costs will have an
obvious effect on the price level.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#21:1>
In short, what we have been presented with is a budget that prices
services according to prevailing costs, rather than one that attempts to
economise on costs to provide, at least in part, the necessary resources for
better and expanded services.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#22:1>
Notwithstanding the larger allocations made to the Depreciation
Reserve Fund ( to be drawn on for track renewal etc), this kind of cost-plus
pricing hurts the economy in general and the travelling public in particular.
</p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#23:1>
The decision to discontinue production of first-class coaches on
<quote> " egalitarian" </quote> grounds will, contrary to Mr. <w>
Fernandes's </w> claims, make little difference to capacity available for
second-class passengers as the Railways had already decided to phase out such
coaches in favour of the more popular air-conditioned sleeper coaches.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#24:1>
One positive feature of Mr. <w> Fernandes's </w> budget is that the
one new project proposed to be taken up this year, the West Coast line, will
be funded differently.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#25:1>
As already announced, a separate corporation is to be set up with the
joint participation of the beneficiary States.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#26:1>
This should hasten completion of this long-delayed project. </p>

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#27:1>
<h> <bold> Soviet presidency </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#28:1>
After two days of hard bargaining in the Congress of <w> People's
</w> Deputies, the Soviet <w> Union's </w> super Parliament, Mr. Mikhail
Gorbachev has managed to have the essence of his reform legislation passed.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#29:1>
Although the abolition of Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution (
which guarantees the Communist <w> Party's </w> monopoly over power) and the
establishment of the executive presidency are logically interlinked, there
was strong resistance from the radical reformists, the Inter-Regional Group
of Deputies, to the executive presidency.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#30:1>
They felt that there were few checks and balances on the <w>
President's </w> sweeping powers.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#31:1>
The legislation has now been adopted after amending these powers to
allow the President to block a Bill only once and to permit him to declare an
emergency only after consulting the constituent republics of the union.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#32:1>
Once the new laws come into effect and the Soviet <w> Union's </w>
first freely elected Parliament is constituted and the President assumes
office, the country will have what is essentially the United <w> States' </w>
system of choosing its legislature and executive, but with perhaps less
presidential power to override legislation.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#33:1>
In a few days Mr. Gorbachev is certain to be elected the first Soviet
President with executive power, opposition to his candidature being token.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#34:1>
His powers as executive President would in any case have been no
greater than what he currently enjoys as General Secretary of the CPSU, even
if amendments to the reform legislation had not been accepted.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#35:1>
But the radical reformists certainly had a valid point because in a
democratic system the executive head, even if elected, must be more
answerable to the elected legilsature than the head of the Communist Party
has been under the old system. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#36:1>
Now that the political system stands on the threshold of a major
change, Mr. Gorbachev will have to address the criticism, growing intense in
recent days, that economic reform under <it> perestroika </it> has been
proceeding too slowly and with little tangible result.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#37:1>
The legislation now passed by the Congress has also amended the
Constitution to allow private ownership of productive enterprises.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#38:1>
Rapid economic change to dismantle bureaucratic control of the
economy must follow soon. </p>

<p> Even before assuming the executive presidency, Mr. Gorbachev has been
presented with what must be a major challenge to the new dispensation - - the
nationalist unrest in the republics.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#39:1>
On the eve of the Congress session, the new Lithuanian Supreme Soviet
met in Vilnius and declared the republic an independent state, formally
nullifying the Baltic <w> state's </w> <quote> " voluntary" </quote> merger
with the Soviet Union in 1940.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#40:1>
Mr. <w> Gorbachev's </w> initial reaction that the declaration was
illegal and that he would not negotiate - - one negotiates only with foreign
governments - - was softened to saying that a dialogue ( as distinct from
negotiations) must be held.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#41:1>
For the present <w> Lithuania's </w> secession is essentially
semantic.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#42:1>
Even in the long run, the economic bonds between Moscow and Vilnius
may remain as strong as they are now.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#43:1>
But since Mr. Gorbachev has already promised to formulate a mechanism
by which any Soviet republic can secede, it is of the utmost importance that
this be done soon and Lithuania be fitted into the lawful secession framework
if it persists in wanting to leave.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#44:1>
Other republics will then feel confident that they have a certain
right which they may ultimately not need to use if the federal structure of
the union is made more equitable. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Gold always shines </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#46:2>
THE PROPOSED ABOLITION of the Gold Control Act will stop
harassment of goldsmiths and end the corruption that has permeated the gold
<w> trade's </w> interaction with government agencies.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#47:2>
But it will not put a stop to the large-scale smuggling of gold and
the foreign exchange loss that goes with such smuggling.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#48:2>
To end smuggling, measures will have to be taken to increase legal
supplies since there is no way the Indian appetite for the yellow metal can
be curbed.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#49:2>
One of the objectives of the Gold Control Act was to curb the demand
for gold.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#50:2>
But what the Act achieved instead was the creation of a premium on
domestic prices, making smuggling all the more attractive. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#51:2>
India produces two tonnes of gold every year, while annual demand
is estimated to be 150 tonnes at the very minimum.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#52:2>
To be sure, abolition of the Gold Control Act will encourage
recycling of at least some of the vast amount of gold hoarded in the country.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#53:2>
But it is unlikely that releases from gold hoards will be large
enough to meet domestic demand.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#54:2>
Gold is not just a perfect hedge against inflation, its real value is
forever appreciating.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#55:2>
Hence, the larger part of domestic holding will remain where they
are.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#56:2>
A suggestion made by government committees as well as by the gold
trade is to permit ( subject to payment of duty) Indians travelling abroad
and visiting non-resident Indians to bring in a small quantity of gold.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#57:2>
It has been estimated that with an allowance of up to 100 grams for
an arriving passenger, annual supplies can be augmented by close to 100
tonnes. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#58:2>
A valid argument against this proposal is that it confers a
privilege on those wealthy enough to travel or live abroad and allows them to
profit from domestic sale of imported gold as well.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#59:2>
But is there any alternative?

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#60:2>
The current fall in gold prices is in all likelihood no more than a
temporary fallout of the proposed abolition of the Gold Control Act which has
been attributed to market nervousness.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#61:2>
A 55 per cent mark-up on international gold price will not disappear
just with the removal of the Act.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#62:2>
A whole edifice of foreign exchange leakage and black money
generation has been built on the smuggling that thrives on the shortfall in
domestic supplies.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#63:2>
Augment supplies and the edifice will crumble.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#64:2>
Hence, abolition of the Gold Control Act should be the first and not
the last step in bringing some order to the domestic market. </p>

<h> <bold> Bold move </bold> </h>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#66:2>
On the face of it, the Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr. Veerendra
Patil, has done his Government proud by spurning the blandishments of the
liquor <quote> " lobby" </quote> .

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#67:2>
In a climate of cynicism Mr. Patil deserves kudos for laying bare the
politician-trader nexus and charging manufacturers with offering kickbacks
in return for jointly cheating the exchequer.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#68:2>
The ostensible provocation for the Chief <w> Minister's </w> outburst
on the floor of the Karnataka legislature on Wednesday was the publication of
an advertisement by a liquor manufacturer the day before to protest against
fresh imposts on beer and Indian made foreign liquor ( IMFL) and threatening
to move production units away.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#69:2>
An attempt by a manufacturer to influence the Chief Minister plainly
bounced on him when his tribe was hauled up for <quote> " falsifying"
</quote> documents to establish exports to other States and for manipulation
to install pliable excise officials in place of scrupulous ones.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#70:2>
Mr. <w> Patil's </w> observations could not have been wholly
impulsive because the hike on IMFL export duty from Re. 1 to Rs. 20 per bulk
litre had beeen virtually designed to punish greedier manufacturers.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#71:2>
Mr. Patil revealed that after accounting for supplies to the defence
sector, a substantial portion of what was shown as exports to other States
was actually sold in Karnataka.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#72:2>
He had therefore ensured that excise rules had been tightened so that
bottles did not leave the State without security labels.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#73:2>
Perhaps he had driven the <quote> " lobby" </quote> he had in mind to
the wall, though the Mysore Sales International Limited ( MSIL), which was
appointed the sole distributor, currently has its rights under scrutiny
following a plea in the Supreme Court.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#74:2>
The <quote> " lobby" </quote> could be in trouble there too because
if the Chief Minister has his way he will stake the <w> State's </w> claim to
distributorship in exports and imports as well.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#75:2>
He was on the offensive on Wednesday while awaiting the Supreme <w>
Court's </w> verdict and clarified that he was anxious to effect a wholesale
takeover of liquor distribution so that all revenue leakages could be
plugged.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#76:2>
Mr. <w> Patil's </w> endeavours will have a wide measure of public
support, particularly when they are aimed at raising resources for
developmental activity. </p>

<p> 
<ICE-IND:W2E-010#77:2>
The best the more avaricious manufacturers can now do is convey
to Mr. Patil that they have learnt their lesson and will henceforth pay more
regard to excise regulations.

<ICE-IND:W2E-010#78:2>
However, only time will tell now long the Chief Minister can sustain
his zeal for such laudably public-spirited objectives and whether concern for
probity can consistently transcend personal and party affiliations. </p> </I>
