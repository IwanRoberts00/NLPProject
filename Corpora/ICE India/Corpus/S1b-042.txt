<I>

<$A> <&> Recording broken </&>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#1:1:A>
He was born to a wealthy landlord <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#2:1:A>
He got good education <,> and got well-paid cosy job with the
Planning Commission <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#3:1:A>
But he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did
not really reach the needy <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#4:1:A>
He was disillusioned <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#5:1:A>
His restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the
Himalayas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#6:1:A>
But even the life of <indig> sanyasi </indig> disillusioned him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#7:1:A>
So he decided to go back to Andhra Pradesh to write a book on the
tribals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#8:1:A>
But what he saw shocked him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#9:1:A>
He saw woman being yoked instead of oxen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#10:1:A>
Enough was enough he decided <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#11:1:A>
He gave up the idea of writing the book <,> and decided to work for
the welfare of the tribals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#12:1:A>
He became their liberator <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#13:1:A>
He is P K S Madhavan <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#14:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> meet him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#15:1:A>
<w> Let's </w> hear more about him <,> his experience and the
voluntary organisation he set up from him <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#16:1:A>
Mr Madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation
<mention> AWARE </mention> <,> which you set up <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#17:1:B>
In nineteen seventy-five <,> when I moved into Andhra Pradesh
<,> with the interest of writing a book on tribals <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#18:1:B>
I did a small research in one block where about five thousand
tribals <,> were given about ten million <indig> rupees </indig> <,> in a
government programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#19:1:B>
And once our former Prime Minister was telling only twelve percent
of the money reached people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#20:1:B>
My research in that particular block <,> I found only two percent
reached people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#21:1:B>
And ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#22:1:B>
But I found that why this is happening <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#23:1:B>
Millions of <indig> rupees </indig> were put in <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#24:1:B>
Why people are not responding <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#25:1:B>
And I discovered <,,> people are not part of planning <,,> not part
of implementation <,> not part of <,> evaluation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#26:1:B>
So I thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#27:1:B>
I get my name <,> I get my <,> doctorate but people are not going
to benefit out of it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#28:1:B>
So I said <w> I'm </w> not going to write a book <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#29:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> create awareness among the people <,> so that they
will decide their future <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#30:1:B>
So with that intention I started this organisation <mention> AWARE
</mention>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#31:1:A>
How did you realise that only two percent of the planning and
development really reached the people <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#32:1:B>
You see when I <,> tracked the money where it has gone <,> I
found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration
bureaucracy and other things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#33:1:B>
And about thirty percent of the money has gone <,,> by middle man
<,> corruption <,> and commission etcetera <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#34:1:B>
Seven percent of this money reached poor people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#35:1:B>
So I felt atleast seven percent reached <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#36:1:B>
When I investigated five percent of this money was <,> misused by
the people themselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#37:1:B>
So only two percent reached people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#38:1:B>
So this is the fate of our planning and implementation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#39:1:B>
Then what will happen to our country <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#40:1:B>
So I said why this is happening <,,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#41:1:B>
People must be able to know what they wanted <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#42:1:B>
Where they live <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#43:1:B>
What their future <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#44:1:B>
So <w> people's </w> participation is a fundamental necessity <,>
for any development

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#45:1:A>
How did you make people participate in your ventures <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#46:1:A>
How did you draw out the meek tribals into your <,> work ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#47:1:B>
In the beginning people did not trust me

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#48:1:B>
Because <w> I'm </w> a new person <,> and <w> I'm </w> talking a
different language <,> and they <,> did not believe me at all

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#49:1:B>
In some place there was an opposition <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#50:1:B>
People <}> <-> thrown </-> <+> threw </+> </}> stone at me <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#51:1:B>
In one village they <}> <-> want </-> <+> wanted </+> </}> to shoot
at me <-> as </-> with the arrows <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#52:1:B>
But persuasion continuous meeting <,> and explaining them <,> and
motivation has helped me <,> after six months eight months <,> to people to
understand there is a man who is talking about them <,> and trying to help
them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#53:1:B>
So that is how I just <?> tempted </?> and also I used telling the
stories to the children meeting the women <,> talking to the <,> elderly
people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#54:1:B>
Slowly I became friend of them <,> and they started accepting <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#55:1:A>
How do you communicate with the tribals <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#56:1:B>
In the beginning I was talking <}> <-> a a </-> <+> with the
</+> </}> help of a interpreter <,> a local man <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#57:1:B>
Normally a vested interest their opinion maker <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#58:1:B>
Slowly slowly when I was able to observe <-> the </-> their
problems <,> I started directly talking to them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#59:1:B>
Childrens were first my media <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#60:1:B>
When elderly people <,> I used to talk to them <mention> <indig>
Ramayana </indig> </mention> <,> I used to talk to <mention> <indig>
Mahabharata </indig> </mention>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#61:1:B>
Some of the stories of <,> tribal culture

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#62:1:B>
That is how I became friend with them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#63:1:B>
And I never expected anything from them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#64:1:B>
I never asked them to do anything <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#65:1:B>
Simply discussing <,> becoming friend <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#66:1:B>
So slowly they took me as a friend <,> and then they started
telling their problems <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#67:1:A>
What was your first impression of tribals when you really met
them in nineteen seventy-five <,> and what is your impression of them now <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#68:1:B>
You see my <.> expe </.> my <,> assessment of this poverty in
our country is <,> poverty is a conspiracy <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#69:1:B>
And always people think by giving money <,> poverty can be removed

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#70:1:B>
It is not true <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#71:1:B>
To remove the poverty what we need is courage <,> psychological
make up <,> people must prepare themselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#72:1:B>
And among the tribals they are meek <,> they are afraid of the new
people <,> they don't understand what exactly happening <,> and they are very
traditional <,> they are away from the communication <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#73:1:B>
And even the small communicators were exploiters <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#74:1:B>
So as a result they did not respond to the real development of our
country

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#75:1:A>
And what is their state now <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#76:1:B>
Now after fifteen years <,> of my entry <,> and my <O> one
word </O> work <,> perhaps what I can say is that <,> what we have done is to
explain to the people what government is doing for them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#77:1:B>
What government infrastructure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#78:1:B>
Infact in the whole of the world <,> our country has got an
excellent legislation <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#79:1:B>
Always in favour of poor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#80:1:B>
Our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#81:1:B>
But this has to be translated into action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#82:1:B>
And we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#83:1:B>
But it has to be implemented <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#84:1:B>
So may be the <mention> <w> Aware's </w> </mention> role is <,> to
explain to the people <,> to utilise the infrastructure <,> to make use of
the law <,> for their own social transformation and economic betterment <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#85:1:A>
Do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government
has created <,> for the welfare of the backwards and the tribals <,> your
organisation plays a <,,> key role into passing the benefits to the <{> <[>
tribals </[> and backwards ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#86:1:B>
<[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#87:1:B>
The motivation <,> explanation bringing the people near to the
government infrastructure <,> asking them to fight for their rights <,>
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#88:1:B>
I will give an example <,> there is a rural back <,> in a village
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#89:1:B>
And uh <,> government has got four percent differential rate of
interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#90:1:B>
Nowhere in the world <,> <w> we've </w> got such a infrastructure
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#91:1:B>
But people <}> <-> goes </-> <+> go </+> </}> to a landlord <,> and
take money for six and forty percent interest <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#92:1:B>
Why institution is there <,> why people are not able to utilise it
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#93:1:B>
Because people must know <,> that institution is meant for them <,>
they have right to utilise that institution <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#94:1:B>
I ask these people <,> I organise them to the bank <,> educated
them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#95:1:B>
Asked the bank to help them <,> and I brought bank and people
together <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#96:1:B>
Landlord or the moneylender disappeared <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#97:1:A>
What can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis
the government institutions <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#98:1:B>
See nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary
organisation is going to replace government

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#99:1:B>
It is <,> it is meaningless <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#100:1:B>
The voluntary organisations are always the forerunners <,> the
pilots <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#101:1:B>
Who can experiment <,> who build innovative programmes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#102:1:B>
We can bring the people and government together <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#103:1:B>
So the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and
supplimentary <,> efforts of the government welfare programmes <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#104:1:B>
That should be the <,> spirit of voluntary organisations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#105:1:B>
Educate the people <,> create awareness <,> ask to utilise
government infrastructure <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#106:1:B>
Ask the government also to understand people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#107:1:B>
So they must be catalyst between the people <,> and government <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#108:1:A>
Your organisation <mention> Aware </mention> <,> in how <+>
many </+> states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#109:1:B>
<}> <-> We were work </-> <,> <=> we started our work </=>
</}> in Andhra Pradesh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#110:1:B>
So we are now in <,> covering about two thousand three hundred
villages <,> in Andra Pradesh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#111:1:B>
About eight hundred villages <,> <+> in </+> the neighbouring
Orissa

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#112:1:B>
These are the two <,> uh states where <mention> Aware </mention>
is concentrating <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#113:1:B>
But <w> we've </w> got pilot projects in Kerala <,> Tamil Nadu <,>
Karnataka <,> and Uttar Pradesh <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#114:1:B>
May be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in
Manipur also <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#115:1:A>
But how do you decide that which village <,> needs your
attention and where do you need to go to help the people ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#116:1:B>
In the present area <,> <w> we're </w> working in a
particular area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#117:1:B>
So <w> we're </w> expanding <,> literally like this <,> because
<,> now <mention> Aware </mention> is a known organisation

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#118:1:B>
Hundreds of villages are coming <,> asking us to adopt <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#119:1:B>
But we don't work in an area more than eight years <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#120:1:B>
We withdraw <,> make people themselves be free <,> and indepenent
of <mention> Aware </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#121:1:B>
They have their own future

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#122:1:B>
They <w> must've </w> their own plan <,> and they should not
depend upon <mention> Aware </mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#123:1:B>
Once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another
thousand villages <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#124:1:B>
Like that <w> we're </w> spreading <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#125:1:B>
In a place like Kerala and <,> Tamil Nadu and other places <,>
where there are tribals <,> because my organisation is <,> working <,> for
the tribal welfare <,> and we are also including <indig> harijans </indig>
also <,> <indig> harijans </indig> and tribals are two <,> communities whom
with whom <w> we're </w> working <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#126:1:B>
So wherever there is such people <,> like in Uttar Pradesh <,>
there is a lot of child labour <,> bounded labour <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#127:1:B>
<indig> Mirjapur </indig> district where we are working <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#128:1:B>
Similarly in Vainad in <,> in Kerala <,> where tribals are there
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#129:1:B>
So wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very
bad <,> our organisation is trying to set up a project there <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#130:1:A>
Which one has been your singular achievement <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#131:1:A>
When were you really touched by the <,> apathy shown towards the
tribals <,> and <,> which you feel has been your achievement in the last
fifteen years <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#132:1:B>
In nineteen seventy-five I have seen <,> tribals are <,>
yoked to the <,> tribals are tied to the tree and beaten black and blue <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#133:1:B>
And no law enforcing agency has <O> two words </O> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#134:1:B>
One thing which I cannot forget is once when I was going <,> <w>
I've </w> seen two women <,> yoked like a oxen <,> and made to draw the water
from the well <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#135:1:B>
And I reach landlord and asked them why this is happening <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#136:1:B>
<w> It's </w> a cultural oppression <,> he didn't had any feeling
for it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#137:1:B>
He said <quote> yes </quote> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#138:1:B>
And that among them one is a pregnant woman <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#139:1:B>
I thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have
<-> been </-> happened <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#140:1:B>
If <w> landlord's </w> mother and sister can he <,> yoke like that
<,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#141:1:B>
So that was a a very disturbing fact in my life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#142:1:B>
Then I said no <,> this cannot continue

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#143:1:B>
This is our independent India <,> and <-> I </-> what I thought is
<,> the poor people loss their dignity <,> they are meek <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#144:1:B>
There is a conspiracy to keep them always poor <,> by giving the
alcohol <,> and other things <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#145:1:B>
So now let them <,> discover their dignity <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#146:1:B>
Let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#147:1:B>
That is where my motivation <,,> awareness creation <,> training
camps <indig> mahasabhas </indig> <,> all those thinkers made them to realise
<,> they are equal citizens of this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#148:1:B>
Today <,> a tribal <,> fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away
when he <}> <-> see </-> <+> saw </+> </}> me <,> today he can reach the
gates of the Chief Minister <,> and knock his door <,> and ask him to hear
his problems

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#149:1:B>
<w> That's </w> the greatest satisfaction for me

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#150:1:A>
Do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have
been <,> <w> you've </w> <,> been able to give them this kind of sense of
dignity

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#151:1:B>
I I do not say pride but I feel so happy <,> so content in my
life <,> perhaps I would have never achieved anything more than this <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#152:1:B>
Today a bonded labour <,> who was beaten in my presence <,> is the
president of <indig> mandal praja parishad </indig> <,> what more I <}> <->
wanted </-> <+> want </+> </}> <,> ?

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#153:1:A>
For two years you led the life of a <indig> sanyasi </indig>
<,> why did you give that up <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#154:1:B>
See I thought I must find out some meaning in my life <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#155:1:B>
I thought spiritualism is one of the main <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#156:1:B>
So I became a monk and I was <,> uh with monks <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#157:1:B>
I met a number of great people <,> great <indig> mahatmas </indig>
<,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#158:1:B>
But what I found is <,> they do not have any solution for poverty
and sufferings of the poor people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#159:1:B>
They have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen
it <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#160:1:B>
And I also thought many of these people are expression of
capitalist system <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#161:1:B>
The rich peoples agents <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#162:1:B>
I said no <,> my precious life should not be wasted <,> in these
debates

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#163:1:B>
I must do something action <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#164:1:B>
That action must remove the suffering of the people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#165:1:B>
That is what Swami Vivekananda said <-> it </- > <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#166:1:B>
Perhaps what Swami Vivekananda did <,> I said <,> I tried to
translate in action <,,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#167:1:A>
Uh what role what is the role of women <,> when uh uh <,>
they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of
development <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#168:1:B>
See always in the in the development <,> woman was kept as a
second rate citizen <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#169:1:B>
<w> It's </w> very unfortunate <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#170:1:B>
But I learnt many things from the women themselves in my own
project area <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#171:1:B>
To be very frank in <mention> Aware </mention> <,> women are the
<,> leaders of programme <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#172:1:B>
<w> I'll </w> give one example <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#173:1:B>
Always government is giving some money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#174:1:B>
<mention> Aware </mention> is also giving some money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#175:1:B>
Banks are giving some money <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#176:1:B>
So I spoke to <,> uh a few women <,> I told how long you are going
to recieve the money <,> can't you create money among yourselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#177:1:B>
The discussion went on for two hours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#178:1:B>
And they came out with a small programme which was very very
encouraging <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#179:1:B>
They call it as <indig> chitanya <w> nidhi's </w> </indig>
programme <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#180:1:B>
Each one of them pay five <indig> rupees </indig> in a week <,>
and fifteen must become one unit <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#181:1:B>
And then <,> two hundred and fifty they collect <,> I give two
fifty

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#182:1:B>
Out of five hundred <indig> rupees </indig> four fifty is given to
one woman as a loan <,> which she pay back next week <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#183:1:B>
Like that in <,> thirty seven weeks <,> the so called poor woman
<,> could collect one <indig> crore </indig> forty seven lakhs <indig> rupees
</indig> <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#184:1:B>
So you can see the poor <,> is only our term <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#185:1:B>
Poor is potential <,> and they could keep such a money <,> and
then it is revolved among them <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#186:1:B>
Thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme
today <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#187:1:A>
India is rich in human resources <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#188:1:A>
<w> We've </w> so much of talent amongst ourselves <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#189:1:A>
Now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of <,>
development process

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#190:1:B>
It is my emotional <,> feeling always <,> India cannot be a
poor country <,,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#191:1:B>
With eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest
people <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#192:1:B>
What is happening is <,> the human resource is not planned <,>
developed and utilised <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#193:1:B>
We are always thinking of the economics money <,> material <,>
matter <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#194:1:B>
But this so called rich <,> resource <w> we've </w> got <,> has to
be utilised

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#195:1:B>
So perhaps my next <-> to </- > ten years work is <,> <w> I'm </w>
going to plan in one block or one <indig> samiti </indig> <,> where all human
resource will be planned <,> utilised and developed so that <,> that block
must be self-sufficient <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#196:1:B>
So <,> budgeting human resource is one of the important thing

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#197:1:B>
We must take <,> uh into notice in <-> the </-> our planning <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#198:1:A>
If somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation <,> how
does one do that <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#199:1:B>
Welcome <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#200:1:B>
We we always like people

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#201:1:B>
There are a number of people who support <mention> Aware
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#202:1:B>
Friends of <mention> Aware </mention> members of <mention> Aware
</mention> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#203:1:B>
And <w> we've </w> an ideology like this where <,> through
awareness <,> development is brought <,> and unless development is a <w>
people's </w> movement <,> development has no relevance <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#204:1:B>
Or if the development is meant for the people <,> or poor <,> and
poor must be the captains of the development <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#205:1:B>
These are all our expectations <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#206:1:B>
In another thing in <mention> Aware </mention> <,> uh we always
think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#207:1:A>
What is the full meaning of <mention> Aware </mention> <,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#208:1:B>
<mention> Aware </mention> stands for action for welfare and
awakening in rural environment <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#209:1:A>
Do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or
work for the poor in the urban areas as well ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#210:1:B>
For last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#211:1:B>
Now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban
poor <,> to support

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#212:1:B>
You see today our country is passing through a transition <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#213:1:B>
<-> The </-> already for last twenty years <,> ten percent of the
rural population migrated to the urban areas <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#214:1:B>
And urban areas is not our culture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#215:1:B>
Rural civilisation is our culture <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#216:1:B>
So in order to prevent urbanisation <,,> slums and other problems
<,> we want to take care of the people in urban area itself <,> developing
the rural people

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#217:1:B>
So <,> next year we may perhaps move <-> into </-> little bit into
urban area <,> where poor people comes and migrates <,> and struggle for
their life <,>

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#218:1:A>
What is your dream regarding these people what do they <,>
you really want them to become <,> ?

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#219:1:A>
What do you want to see <,,> ?

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#220:1:B>
In my life I would like to see <,,> the whole of this caste
system <,> which is conspiring to the <,> <w> society's </w> underdevelopment
to be removed <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#221:1:B>
Where a tribal <,> a <indig> harijan </indig> <,> or a <indig>
brahmin </indig> or anybody are equal <,> equally share the responsibility of
governance of this country <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#222:1:B>
And my dream is Mahatma <w> Gandhi's </w> <,> dream <,> a <indig>
gram swaraj </indig> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#223:1:B>
Village that stands on its own <,> leg and its own self-
sufficiency <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#224:1:B>
I believe in <w> Mahatma's </w> <}> <-> <.> per </.> </-> <=>
perfect </=> </}> theory <,> of making a village <,> a <indig> gram swaraj
</indig> <,> that was my dream

<$A> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#225:1:A>
Well Mr <w> Madhavan's </w> dream is also that of a <indig>
gram swaraj </indig> the same as Mahatma <w> Gandhi's </w> <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#226:1:A>
We wish him all luck in his endeavours <,>

<ICE-IND:S1B-042#227:1:A>
Thank you for being with us

<$B> 
<ICE-IND:S1B-042#228:1:B>
Thank you <,> </I>
