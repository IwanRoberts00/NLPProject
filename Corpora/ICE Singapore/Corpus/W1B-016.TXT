<h> BU8INESS TRAVEL IN SINGAPORE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#11:1>
Reference to your fax dated 5 March 1992 of the abovementioned
subject, I submit herewith the following comments in accordance to your
questions.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#12:1>
1) I would see a noticeable increase of business travellers and a
marginal increase of leisure travellers from 1992 as compared to 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#13:1>
In terms of percentage, overall business travellers would increase by
7-8% and 2-3% for leisure travellers in 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#14:1>
The outlook for 1993 would be a sunrise situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#15:1>
Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the industry would sail
smoothly with an average growth of 4-5% in terms of business/leisure
arrivals.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#16:1>
The anticipated recovery of the US economy after President Bush
returns to power, the long awaited recovery of the Australian and New Zealand
economy, the continued growth in Asia, particularly the developing countries
like Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia, and last but not least,
the urgent take-off of the economic reformation of China are some of the
factors propel our industry into a better performed one.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#17:1>
Personally, I would foresee that the business travellers would
comprise a slightly bigger percentage as to leisure travellers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#18:1>
I am looking at the ratio of 1:1.25.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#19:1>
2) The shift in the business mix is due to the following reasons: a)
Singapore will strengthen its position as a focal point for banking, finance,
trading, transport and communications to the rest of South East Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#20:1>
b) More and more regional offices of multi-national companies and
Asia-based companies would set up in Singapore as Hong Kong draws nearer to
1997.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#21:1>
c) With the support from our government on globalisation and
international business alliance programmes, there will be an influx of
business travellers to and from Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#22:1>
d) The increase in the number of International airlines to Singapore
has enhanced the accessibility factor for more businessmen to travel.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#23:1>
The " open-market" policy in Europe and US will certainly help in
opening new routings to and from Singapore which is of great advantage for
us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#24:1>
3) Singapore's prospect as a business destination in 1992 and 1993 is
going to be bright as explained in point number 2.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#25:1>
4) At present, we continue to maintain high level of service, provide
product consistency and stay competitive in our pricing structure in order to
attract more business travellers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#26:1>
5) The following are the tentative list of renovations and facilities
that Holiday Inn Park View would carry out in the next 12 months: a) A
complete renovation of the Executive Lounge on the 7th floor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#27:1>
b) Refurbishing of all the guests' rooms particularly the Executive
Club rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#28:1>
c) Re-design and upgrading of the Clememceau Bar and the hotel's
lobby.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#29:1>
d) An upgrade of the gym facilities at the Health Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#30:1>
I trust that the above-mentioned comments would be sufficient to meet
your requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#31:1>
Please note that the above comments on point 1 to 3 are my personal
opinions and they do not represent or reflect the views of the company.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#32:1>
Thank you and best regards.

8 January 1992 <h> JOINT PROMOTION - HIGM and HIPV ON DELUXE and
EXECUTIVE CLUB ROOMS 1992 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#94:2>
First of all, I wish you and all your sales staff a very prosperous
and Happy New Year!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#95:2>
I tried several times to contact you through phone or holidex to
discuss the above subject in December 1991 but apparently, you were either on
leave or out for meetings.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#96:2>
In any case, we need to explore further on this scheme rather
urgently as the Regional Office and the owner are anxious to know the
development.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#97:2>
On the above-mentioned proposal, we had a meeting in December and
here are the comments and proposals which we need your consensus:-

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#98:2>
SCHEME: HIGM and HIPV Bonus Plan - In principle, we agree to go on a
joint effort to secure more FIT business travellers or executives for both
properties with a common owner.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#99:2>
MECHANISM: Your bonus point system based on every HK&dollar;1000 spent (
masterbill), the client earn one HIGM Bonus coupon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#100:2>
Please advise one coupon is equivalent to how many points.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#101:2>
OUR PROPOSAL: Assuming that we work on similar system of awarding
points to the amount spent by the client, we may need to devise a different
amount criterion to achieve the complimentary room.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#102:2>
We presume that the accumulated complimentary rooms would be used
vice versa for both hotels.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#103:2>
However, due to the different rooms inventory and also different
percentage of FIT corporate guests, we would prefer to work on one to one
basis of exchange ( contra concept) and whatever number exceeds, we will bill
either parties on a reasonable room rate to be agreed upon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#104:2>
COUPON DEISGN: It has to be standardised and promotional or and
PROMOTION advertising activities need to be co-ordinated with an equitable
fund sharing scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#105:2>
We trust that the above-mentioned is in order and I would appreciate
it if you can give us your comments or any ideas to ensure the joint
promotion is effective and beneficial for both hotels in terms of revenue.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#106:2>
Thank you and await for your response soonest possible.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#107:2>
Best regards.

Please be informed that we will be launching the above-mentioned

Strictly no travel agents' contracted rates ( FIT and GIT).

Scheme : Every S&dollar;300 that an in-house guest spends at HIPV will
entitle to one bonus coupon equivalent to 10 points.

them for one ( 1) night's complimentary stay in HIPV or HIGM deluxe room and

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#122:2>
Subsequent nights' stay will be given a discount of 40% off the

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#123:2>
All coupons are fully transferable.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#124:2>
Internal Accounting procedures : All coupons are serialised and
HIPV's coupon is blue and HIGM's coupon is green in colour.

which is equivalent to 2 room nights at an agreed rate of US&dollar;100.00 per
night.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-016#128:2>
Therefore, at the end of the promotion, both Account departments
shall need to liaise with each other on the above.
