<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#3:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#4:1>
Coral reef fish communities are the most diverse and colourful of any
fish communities with very complex inter-relationships between species (
Smith and Tyler, 1972; Sale, 1974; Russell, Talbot and Domm, 1974).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#5:1>
This paper is based on studies made from the southern islands off the
main island of Singapore, particularly from Pulau Salu ( Fig 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#6:1>
A few observations made from Pulau Tioman, off the east coast of
Peninsular Malaysia, were also included.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#7:1>
The species composition and distribution in relation to the
physiographic characteristics of the littoral area, the effects of tides on
the distribution patterns, the trophic status of fishes from their food and
feeding habits, the behaviour of the fishes in terms of mobility, colouration
and symbiosis with other organisms are discussed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#8:1>
<h> PHYSIOGRAPHY 0F THE CORAL REEF AND ADJACENT AREAS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#9:1>
Based on the nature of the substrata, most of the reefs around
Singapore can be divided into five zones: the rock pool, the rocky reef flat,
the sandy reef flat, the reef edge and the reef slope ( Fig 2).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#10:1>
Details of each of these zones are given by Tay and Khoo ( 1985).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#11:1>
However, a brief description of the various zones will be given here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#12:1>
The rock pool zone is at the high water tide level.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#13:1>
They are totally submerged only during high spring tides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#14:1>
This zone is characterised by algae such as Caulerpa sp, Chaetophora
sp and Padina commersonni.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#15:1>
The main invertebrate animals are Ligia vitiensis ( sea slaters) and
the periwinkles such as Littoraria granularis, L undulata, L ventricosa and
Nodilittorina pyrimidalis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#16:1>
The rocky reef flat zone lies at the upper inter-tidal region.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#17:1>
It is characterised by loose rocks and boulders, by barnacles such as
Balanus amphitrite, Tetraclita porosa and Chthamalus stellatus and by
gastropods such as Nerita undata, Monodonta labio and Planaxis sulcatus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#18:1>
The sandy reef flat lies between the low water neap tide to the
margin of the reef edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#19:1>
Between August and January, Sargassum sp grows in this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#20:1>
Molluscs found in this zone are Thais echinulata ( dog whelk), Turbo
bruneaus ( turban shell), Trochus gibberula ( top shell), Tridacna crocea (
giant clam), Malleus regulus ( T-shell) and Pyrene fulguran ( pyrenes).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#21:1>
Hard and soft corals are found in this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#22:1>
The reef edge zone lies at the lower inter-tidal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#23:1>
This zone is exposed only once in two weeks at the lowest low water
spring tides; however, at other low tides it is covered by a shallow layer of
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#24:1>
There are many fungiid, brain and other kinds of corals in this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#25:1>
It has a wide variety of living corals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#26:1>
Because of the growth of these corals this zone is slightly more
elevated than the previous sandy reef zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#27:1>
When in season, Sargassum weeds extend down to this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#28:1>
The reef slope zone is the subtidal portion of the reef.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#29:1>
It is never exposed at low tides and supports the greatest number of
individuals and species of invertebrates especially the scleractinian ( hald)
and alcyonarian ( soft) corals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#30:1>
The sea-fans ( gorgonids), the sea-urchins ( Diadema setosum) and the
fire-ferns ( Aglaophenia cupressina) are characteristic of the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#31:1>
<h> SPECIES COMPOSITION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#32:1>
Ninety-nine species of fishes from 28 families were recorded from
Pulau Salu ( Tay and Khoo, 1985).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#33:1>
About 25% of these species ( Table I ) belonged to the family
Pomacentridae and 14% to the Lutjanidae ( including the Scolopsidae,
Pentapodidae and Caesiodidae) and another 11% to the Labridae.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#34:1>
These three families constituted 50% of the fish community from
Singapore's fringing coral reefs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#35:1>
<h> ZONATION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOBILITY TYPES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#36:1>
All the fishes observed can be categorised into four mobility types
according to their home range or the size of the area which is required for
their daily activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#37:1>
These four mobility types are.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#38:1>
( a) Solitary and sedentary type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#39:1>
These are fishes which are inactive in terms of swimming activity and
usually live in holes and crevices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#40:1>
( b) Solitary and territorial type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#41:1>
Fishes of this group are active species and do not confine themselves
to their holes and crevices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#42:1>
They defend territories which are relatively small areas from
conspecies as well as others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#43:1>
( c) Solitary and vagrant type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#44:1>
These fishes do not confine themselves to a small area or territory
within the reef.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#45:1>
They are usually very active and wide ranging species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#46:1>
( d) Schooling and vagrant type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#47:1>
This category consists of fishes which are active swimmers which swim
around in schools and ranges widely in the reef.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#48:1>
The species composition of each of these " mobility types" and their
spatial distribution according to the various physiographic zones are given
in Table 2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#49:1>
<h> SOLITARY AND SEDENTARY TYPE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#50:1>
Out of all the coral reef fishes observed or captured, about
thirty-two species are the solitary and sedentary type, with very limited
home range.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#51:1>
They are drab looking and not colourful, cryptic and secretive
species hiding in nooks and corners, holes and crevices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#52:1>
There are six species of apogonids ( caldinal fishes), four species
eaeh of gobiids ( gobies) and serranids ( groupers), three seolpaenids (
scorpion fishes), two species each of blennids ( blennies), holocentrids (
soldierfishes), batraehoids ( frogfishes) and muraenids ( moray eels) and one
each of brotulid ( brotulas), congrogadid ( eel-blennies), platycephalid (
flatheads), plotosid ( catfish eel), centriscid ( shrimpfishes), centropomid
( sea perch) and parapercid ( sand perches).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#53:1>
In the rock pool zone only five solitary and sedentary species were
captured.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#54:1>
They are mainly benthic species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#55:1>
Three species of gobies, one blennid and a brotulid are present in
this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#56:1>
In the rocky patch zone about fourteen species of these drab coloured
and secretive fishes are the main inhabitants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#57:1>
All the species living in the rock pools are also found in this area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#58:1>
In addition to the five rock pool species, three species of
scorpaenids, two species of batrachoid, and one species each of congrogadid,
muraenid, platycephalid and plotosid are found in this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#59:1>
These eight species are not found in the rock pools.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#60:1>
They differ from those species which are the main inhabitants of the
rock pools in that they are larger in size.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#61:1>
These same species except for the congrogadid are also present in the
next zone, the sandy patch zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#62:1>
About thirteen species are observed in the sandy patch zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#63:1>
None of the rock pool species are found in this zone, thus showing
distinct zonation of the fishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#64:1>
In addition, four species of apogonids and one species of serranid
are also found in this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#65:1>
The apogonids are hovering species with less cryptic colouration than
the previous species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#66:1>
They are often found hovering just off the bottom in front of
crevices into which they will seek shelter when confronted by larger
predators, other intruders and during the fast moving currents of the rising
and ebbing tides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#67:1>
They have distinct horizontal stripes and spots on the body.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#68:1>
Except for the brown coral-cod ( Cephalopholis pachycentron) none of
the fish species which inhabit the higher zones such as the rock pools, the
rocky patch and the sandy patch, are found in the lower and deeper reef edge
and the reef slope areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#69:1>
This indicates definite preference of the habitats by the fishes
resulting in their zonation along the shore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#70:1>
Nine species of the solitary and sedentary types are present at the
reef edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#71:1>
They consist of two species each of apogonids, serranids and
holocentrids and one each of centriscid, blennid and muraenid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#72:1>
The apogonids, centriscid and holocentrids are hovering species while
the serranids, blennid and muraenid are benthic bottom hugging species living
in holes and crevices and rarely move far away from their homes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#73:1>
The latter are also not easily seen because of their cryptic
colouration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#74:1>
About fourteen species can be observed at the reef slope zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#75:1>
The nine reef edge species are also found here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#76:1>
In addition to them five new species are found at the reef slope and
are not present anywhere else on the shore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#77:1>
They consisted of two other species of serranids which can grow to a
larger adult size than the reef edge serranid ( Cephalopholis pachvcentron),
a species each of gobiid, centropomid and parapercid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#78:1>
All these are solitary, cryptic and crevice dwellers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#79:1>
<h> SOLITARY AND TERRITORIAL TYPE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#80:1>
All the twenty species of the solitary and territorial type present
at the reef belong to only one family, the Pomacentridae ( damselfishes).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#81:1>
They are mainly hoverers with territories which they would defend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#82:1>
Most of them inhabit the reef edge and the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#83:1>
Three species are found in the rock pools and two of them ( Abudefduf
bengalensis and Dischistodus chrysopoecilus) can inhabit all zones ranging
from the rock pools to the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#84:1>
Most of the smaller individuals are found in the shallow rock pools.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#85:1>
Eight species are observed in the rock patch zone and three of them
are similar to those in the rock pool.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#86:1>
Five new additions are observed in the rock patch zone which are also
found in the sandy patch zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#87:1>
Most of them belong to the genera Dischistodus and Pomacentrus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#88:1>
About seven species of these solitary territorial types are found in
the sandy patch and seventeen each in the reef edge and the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#89:1>
Besides the above three widely distributed species, four other
species are also quite widely distributed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#90:1>
These are found in the rock patch down to the reef slope zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#91:1>
These species are Dischistodus prosopotaenia, Pomacentrus
albimaculus, P littoralis and P rhodonotus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#92:1>
Only two species are not common to both the reef edge and the reef
slope zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#93:1>
They are Pomacentrus rhodonotus which is found commonly in the three
other upper zones and Hemigliphidodon plagiometopon which is found only in
the deeper reef slope zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#94:1>
None of the eleven or twelve species belonging to the reef edge and
the reef slope zones, respectively, are observed in the rock pool, rock patch
or the sandy patch zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#95:1>
These species are apparently restricted to the deeper waters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#96:1>
The mechanism of their restriction may be physiological, ecological
or behavioulal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#97:1>
Nothing is known about the mechanism of zonation of these species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#98:1>
Except for Amphiprion spp and Pomacentrus popei most of the species
are dark coloured ranging from black to brown which is good cryptic
colouration against the brown and black background of the corals and
crevices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#99:1>
<h> SOLITARY AND VAGRANT TYPE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#100:1>
None of these fishes are found in the rock pools.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#101:1>
Fifteen species each are present in the rock patch and the sandy
patch zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#102:1>
Seven species of labrids ( wrasses), two each of monacanthids (
filefishes) and pentapodids ( large-eye breams) and one each of blennid (
blennies), chaetodontid ( butterflyfishes), lutjanid ( snappers) and
scolopsid ( monocle breams).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#103:1>
Eight of them are present in both the reef edge and the reef slope
zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#104:1>
They are Halichoeres hoeveni, H nigriscens, H chloropterus,
Choerodon anchorago, Pentapus caninus, Scolopsis ciliatus, Chelmon rostratus
and Lutjanus chrysotaenia.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#105:1>
These eight species are therefore widely distributed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#106:1>
Their home and activity ranges are quite large.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#107:1>
They are found in all the four zones except the uppermost zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#108:1>
About twenty-eight and twenty-nine species of these solitary and
vagrant types inhabit the reef edge and the reef slope zones, respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#109:1>
Twenty-four species are common between the two zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#110:1>
Five of the species are present only at the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#111:1>
They are probably adapted to deeper waters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#112:1>
They are Cheilinus fasciatus, Scolopsis phaeops, Lutjanus lutjanus,
Siganus virgatus and Chromis cinerascens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#113:1>
Four of the species which are present in the reef edge zone are not
found in the reef slope but they are present in the two upper zones, in the
rocky patch and the sandy patch zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#114:1>
These species are Halichoeres bicolor, Petroscirtes temmincki,
Monacanthus tomentosus and M macrurus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#115:1>
The ranges of these species apparently do not extend beyond the reef
edge to the deeper parts of the reef.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#116:1>
Most of the species in this mobility category are brightly coloured,
fast swimming and can swim some distances away from the sea bottom when they
are not feeding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#117:1>
Only the Monacanthids are brown and not brightly coloured which
allow them to camouflage among the brown sargassum and coral crevices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#118:1>
Except for the chaetodontids, nearly all the species in this group
are predators which probably accounts for their bright colouration since
there is no need to hide from predators.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#119:1>
<h> SCHOOLING AND VAGRANT TYPE </h> <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X120:1>
None of the fishes belonging to this group are found in the
uppermost littoral zones, that is, the rock pools, rock patch and the sandy
patch except for the frys of the mullet ( Mugil sp) which are frequently
observed in the rock pools.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X121:1>
The main fishes belonging to this mobility type consist of four
species of pomacentrids ( damselfishes), two caessiodids ( fusiliers), one
each of mugilid ( mullets), atherinid ( silversides), hemirhamphid (
half-beaks), carangid ( trevallies) and sphyraenid ( barracudas).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X122:1>
Only five of these species are present at the reef edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X123:1>
They Consist of one species each of mugilid, atherinid,
hemirhamphid and two species of pomacentrids.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X124:1>
These fishes are usually found in schools swimming in mid-waters of
the sea bottom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X125:1>
Most of them have bright silvery bodies and are fast swimmers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X126:1>
The reef slope is also the habitat of eleven of these schooling
species which range around widely along this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X127:1>
They include the above five reef edge species and six others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X128:1>
Therefore at the reef slope there are two more species of
pomacentrids, two caesiodids, one carangid and a sphyraenid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X129:1>
Most of them have dark dorsal and bright silvery ventral bodies,
the usual counter shading characteristics of mid-water pelagic dwellers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X130:1>
<h> GENERAL OBSERVATIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X131:1>
Based on the distribution of the reef fishes, the littoral region
of the various islands in Singapore should be divided into three zones which
are the composites of the physiographic zones used in this study.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X132:1>
They are the rock patch, the rocky-sandy patch and the reef
edge-reef slope zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X133:1>
In terms of the total number of species there is an increase as one
moves down from the rock pool to the reef slope zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X134:1>
The reef slope contains the most fishes both in abundance per
species and number of species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X135:1>
Harry ( 1953) in Tuamotu, Gosline ( 1965) in Hawaii, and Vivien (
1977) in Madagascar reported also that most of the reef fishes are found at
the reef slope zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X136:1>
In terms of the physiographic zones, the rock pool zone is the
habitat of the solitary, sedentary, cryptic and secretive types of species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X137:1>
The rocky patch and the sandy patch zones are the homes of the
solitary sedentary fishes as well as the solitary vagrant types.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X138:1>
The reef edge and the reef slope are, however, dominated by the
solitary territorial fishes and the schooling vagrant types.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X139:1>
<h> COVER AND TIDES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X140:1>
There are significantly more fish individuals in areas with more
cover such as Sargassum and other sea-weeds than in open areas without cover
or vegetation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X141:1>
Talbot ( 1965) in Tanganyika, found a clear relationship between
quantity of fishes and percentage cover.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X142:1>
At high tides significantly more fish in terms of abundance are
observed than at low tides in the rocky and the sandy patches but no
significant difference is observed between the reef edge and the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X143:1>
This is obviously related to the relative degree of submersion of
the zones and availability of cover.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X144:1>
The lower two zones, reef edge and slope, are normally submerged at
both the high and the low tides, hence no temporal fluctuation in the fish
population numbers due to tidal changes is expected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X145:1>
The number of species for all mobility types increases
progressively from the rock pool to the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X146:1>
This is related probably to the availability of hiding spots for
the solitary sedentary types; the increase in the bottom cover which provide
protective hiding areas to most of the solitary territorial fishes like the
pomacentrids, the most prominent being Pomacentrus littoralis and P
albimaculus; the increase in the water column ( Gosline, 1965; Chave and
Eckert, 1974) in providing space for manoeuvring for the actively swimming
solitary and the schooling vagrant fishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X147:1>
Randall ( 1963) suggested that the more complex the structure and
composition of the reef, the more hiding places and feeding areas it provides
and therefore it will maintain and attract a greater number of fish species
and individuals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X148:1>
The reef edge and the reef slope zones are evidently more complex
in terms of corals, plants and other invertebrates, hence providing more
niches than the rock pool, rocky patch and the sandy patch zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X149:1>
<h> RESIDENTS AND TIDAL VISITORS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X150:1>
About seventy-three species are residents while about twenty-six
are tidal visitors ( Table 2).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X151:1>
The tidal visitors consist of five species of scolopsids, four of
lutjanids, two each of pentapodids, caesiodids and pomacentrids and one each
of lethrinid, atherinid, carangid, centropomid, hemirhamphid, labrid,
mugilid, mullid, scarid, siganid and sphyraenid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X152:1>
Almost all the solitary sedentary and territorial types are
residents of the coral reef.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X153:1>
The solitary vagrant types consisted of both tidal visitors and
residents but more of the latter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X154:1>
The proportion of tidal visitors increase as one goes deeper
towards the reef slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X155:1>
Eight of the eleven species of the schooling vagrant type are tidal
visitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X156:1>
They visit the reef edge and the reef slope during the high tides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X157:1>
Four of these schooling vagrant fishes are pomacentrids, out of
which three are residents ( Neopomacentrus filamentosus, N nemurus and N
taeniurus) and the other ( Chromis atripectoralis) is a tidal visitor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X158:1>
Most of the visitors are pelagic forms which pay short term visits
to the reef edge and reef slope zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X159:1>
The schooling vagrant types seldom swim towards the shallower areas
such as the rock pools and the rocky-sandy patch zones.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X160:1>
<h> FOOD AND FEEDING HABITS </h> <h> Feeding Patterns </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X161:1>
Most of the fishes inhabiting coral reefs are the more recently
evolved teleosts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X162:1>
The diversity in coral reef fishes is an expression of their
adaptations to the reef habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X163:1>
Most of their success and evolution is through adaptations that
increase their manoeuverability and their feeding efficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-021#X164:1>
A diversity of feeding specialisations can be seen among these
fishes from their mouth parts and feeding mechanisms and their food and
