<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#145:1:A>
Aik Leng has very good ball sense

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#146:1:A>
That day I played tennis with her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#147:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#148:1:B>
Experience

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#149:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#156:1:B>
Okay lor it's finally I mean slowly lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#157:1:A>
Zul maybe because she doesn't expose herself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#158:1:B>
Zul is mainly a static <unclear> word </unclear> sort of

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#159:1:A>
But she is very serious right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#160:1:A>
I mean like I play games my my motive is to enjoy myself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#161:1:A>
Her motive is what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#162:1:A>
To

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#163:1:B>
But she does enjoy I mean she enjoy pulling weights

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#164:1:A>
Hah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#165:1:A>
I can't imagine myself enjoy pulling weights

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#166:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#167:1:A>
Maggie is that of like uh systematic building up like uh do
my arms do my stomach

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#168:1:B>
Yah I quite I find it quite boring lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#169:1:B>
Sit down there or stand down there in the room and it's keep
repeating you see it's repetitive it's repetitive you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#170:1:A>
Yah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#171:1:B>
So <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#172:1:B>
Then you train for this muscle and then next one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#173:1:A>
Yah then must plan one you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#174:1:B>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#175:1:A>
When I do sports I never plan

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#176:1:B>
I think it's good lah to do a <unclear> word </unclear>
people like me so skinny

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#177:1:A>
No but that doesn't mean you're not healthy what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#178:1:B>
True true

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#179:1:A>
Okay I think Maggie is quite weak

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#180:1:B>
Maggie is quite

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#181:1:A>
Quite weak

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#182:1:A>
You know when I look at her like a bit fragile uh frail like even

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#183:1:B>
She's thin lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#184:1:A>
Maybe that lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#185:1:A>
Like even Teresa she I know she jogs she plays tennis

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#186:1:B>
But Maggie swims what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#187:1:B>
But I heard she said she got dislocated before right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#188:1:A>
Doing what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#189:1:B>
Doing <unclear> word </unclear> I don't know what lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#190:1:B>
She was just probably that's why she didn't play uh dangerous
games lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#191:1:A>
Better not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#192:1:B>
Wait come out

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#193:1:B>
But not long she told me before she has a screw inside her arm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#194:1:A>
Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#195:1:A>
You mean it hasn't been removed uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#196:1:B>
No so when she go and take X-ray

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#197:1:A>
Then see the screw

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#198:1:A>
But normally they remove it after like two years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#199:1:B>
Probably

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#200:1:B>
Once you fix the your own skin <unclear> word </unclear> position
because <unclear> word </unclear> I dislocated my elbow before so uh okay lah
I mean once lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#201:1:B>
To other people hah if you dislocated once then it it'll occur
very easily

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#202:1:A>
Yah prone to it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#203:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> it will come out yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#204:1:B>
You'll be more prone to it so maybe she is this case lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#205:1:B>
That's why she needs to <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#206:1:A>
My father had an accident last year a motorbike accident

<ICE-SIN:S1A-077#207:1:A>
