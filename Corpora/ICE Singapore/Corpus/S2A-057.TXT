<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#1:1:A>
Now what you see here is the workplace shelf okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#2:1:A>
Uhm these are icons okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#3:1:A>
What you see here are icon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#4:1:A>
You can move them around using your mouse buttons okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#5:1:A>
You can uhm drag them and reposition them and things like the a
shape like this meant uh folders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#6:1:A>
This is quite the same as Windows three dot X kind of uhm uh
interface where you click and it open uh it's a folder or MacKintosh okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#7:1:A>
Now I show you what are the differences okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#8:1:A>
Let me find a scratch disk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#9:1:A>
Okay now for example I want to access uh my drive A the diskette
that I've just stuck in okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#10:1:A>
What normally I can do is I go to the command prompt and say A and
let maybe fall back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#11:1:A>
But in in this kind of an object oriented workplace shelf what I
can do is I open the drive folder and you can see that these are all the
drive I have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#12:1:A>
I have A drive B drive is my uh tape <unclear> word </unclear> I
have in my hard disk C D E F partition and I have a C R ROM attached on this
this system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#13:1:A>
So for exmaple like I want to okay this shows what I have in the A
drive disk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#14:1:A>
It's blank now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#15:1:A>
For example like I want to format the disk I can just click on the
icon and I got the pop up menu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#16:1:A>
Okay I can just press and clicks and say format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#17:1:A>
Okay and it give me what are the various uh capacity I I'll like to
format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#18:1:A>
Okay then I just click format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#19:1:A>
It'll go formatting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#20:1:A>
Now let's look at the other uhm stuff we have on the desk top okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#21:1:A>
We have things like a shredder here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#22:1:A>
Okay which you can creates uh objects I mean you you can delete an
object

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#23:1:A>
For example uhm I want trash away this file called tic-tak-toe

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#24:1:A>
I can just drag and drop on the shredder and guess what delete
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#25:1:A>
This is quite similar to MacKintosh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#26:1:A>
Anyone is a MacKintosh user over there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#27:1:A>
Ya it looks like MacKintosh right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#28:1:A>
You drag it to the I think MacKintosh is trash trash can okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#29:1:A>
So this is delete and let let's look at the DOS uhm folder here
which I have all this dull DOS icon here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#30:1:A>
What do I do if let's say if I want to change an icon okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#31:1:A>
It's also object oriented right I just have to click the setting
notebook for this icon and if this is Lotus and I want to use this icon for
it I can just drag this and I drop on the current icon box here and guess
what

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#32:1:A>
This icon is changed okay so it's this kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#33:1:A>
You don't have to issue command say change icon or you don't have
to go to the top bar there and pull down your selection ah select icon change
this kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#34:1:A>
So it's object oriented in this aspects and for example like uhm
changing the colour of your uh system object

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#35:1:A>
For example like I want to go to the background okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#36:1:A>
Uh I go to the system setup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#37:1:A>
What I need to do is I just open the colour palate the colours are
<unclear> word </unclear> also object

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#38:1:A>
What I have to do is just drag the colour and drop onto the place
where I want to change

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#39:1:A>
You can see that the colours change pretty nicely okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#40:1:A>
And to activate programme is just by double clicking of the of the
icon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#41:1:A>
And you'll see that while I was doing all those the formatting is
done in the background

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#42:1:A>
This is what I meant by multitasking and it's done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#43:1:A>
And for example I want to save a file onto drive B what do I do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#44:1:A>
I can just drag and drop on it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#45:1:A>
For example this file type A I'll drag and can see that I think the
A drive should be blinking right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#46:1:A>
It's not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#47:1:A>
Sorry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#48:1:A>
Or I'll choose another file anyway

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#49:1:A>
Uhm how about <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#50:1:A>
Ya if if in case for any reason why I can't move this file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#51:1:A>
You'll see that the no entry sign is there okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#52:1:A>
Not to worry let me copy something from my E drive uhm let me
<unclear> word </unclear> save file does not use the text file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#53:1:A>
That means I can copy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#54:1:A>
Can drag over drag you know hopefully

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#55:1:A>
I think it's there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#56:1:A>
It's there right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#57:1:A>
I think so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#58:1:A>
So to show that it's there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#59:1:A>
Okay the convix save file is there so but anyway if for any Doser
<unclear> word </unclear> common command prompt user would like to use
command prompt die-hard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#60:1:A>
Those of you without without seeing the command prompt <unclear>
word </unclear> there's also O S two command prompt you can use okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#61:1:A>
And from this command prompt you can always uh set

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#62:1:A>
For this is the O S two command prompt and you can open up a DOS
file by just saying well then you can go to a DOS environment okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#63:1:A>
I'll show more of this later

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#64:1:A>
Okay uhm like for example like the drive folders I open up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#65:1:A>
You can also see that it's in a tree form and this the
sub-directories are all organise in folders also okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#66:1:A>
So it is object oriented in this ex aspect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#67:1:A>
Now what I want to show you next is uhm compatiblity of uhm DOS and
Window

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#68:1:A>
I'l I'll have you got a very clear

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#69:1:A>
I mean at least a clear idea of what workplace shelf

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#70:1:A>
It's this shell this moving of icon this creating of icon deleting
by dragging pulling <unclear> word </unclear> dropping this is what I meant
easy to use or the or the workplace shell

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#71:1:A>
Okay the next topic that I want to go through is the compatibility
of uhm DOS okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#72:1:A>
For I can run things like Word Perfect for DOS okay and I can put
them into the background

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#73:1:A>
Alright this is DOS Word Perfect running in one window and I can
run Lotus one two three and I can put this also in the window form put them
side by side okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#74:1:A>
Now by a by being able to run my DOS applications side by side onto
on on the desk on the O S two desk top what does it buy me as a user okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#75:1:A>
In the DOS environment or in the simple DOS DOS environment single
tasking even uhm what you can do let's say you want to copy all this sales
uhm figures all this figures onto a word processor file what you can do is
you can only convert them to a file and then export them in Word Perfect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#76:1:A>
You have to read those text file in right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#77:1:A>
But let's say if you run can run them on the desk top side by side
you can do simple things like cut and paste right and it hand <unclear> word
</unclear> enhance the capability of your DOS applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#78:1:A>
It's not only the DOS application you can do cut and paste

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#79:1:A>
Uhm in our office I'm using the comms manager two okay uhm I'm able
to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#80:1:A>
You see now in the in the host environment let's say if I want to
reply to a mail somebody send me a mail okay it's in fax form

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#81:1:A>
I want to reply to the mail and I I like to do some quoting so
normaly if if I don't don't have O S two cut and paste facility what I have
to do is I have to copy that mail into a file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#82:1:A>
Then I open up the file I use the text editor to add those arrow by
the side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#83:1:A>
Then I close that file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#84:1:A>
I have to evoke that mail and call that file in and then I send
that file okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#85:1:A>
Now in in the host I mean if running on O S two what I can do is I
just lift <unclear> word </unclear> up that portion of text mark it up in my
incoming mail okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#86:1:A>
It'll click and go into my O S two clip board

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#87:1:A>
Then I just have to key into I mean uh respond

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#88:1:A>
Then you have have another fresh uhm mailer screen to come up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#89:1:A>
Then I say paste paste onto the same box okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#90:1:A>
In that in that case I can do a lot of manipulation and that would
add to my capability of my using my prompt my I B M prompt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#91:1:A>
I don't know whether this will give you a good idea or not because
I think in N U S you just use prompt right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#92:1:A>
Bitnet yah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#93:1:A>
For today's set up here you can see the two machine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#94:1:A>
Actually we're trying to do some networking in this room but it was
not really successful so we can't do that uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#95:1:A>
Therefore I just mention this okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#96:1:A>
Okay cut and paste

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#97:1:A>
Uh well this is just between the DOS applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#98:1:A>
Now what I'm going to show is uhm sharing of datas uhm between O S
two and Windows applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#99:1:A>
With this I would like to show that O S two can run Windows and of
course it can also share the Windows application data with whatever
application that it is running on Windows platform okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#100:1:A>
So I'll like to run Excel here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#101:1:A>
This is Microsoft Excel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#102:1:A>
Now in O S two point O when I run Excel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#103:1:A>
I probably would have to run it in the full screen mode

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#104:1:A>
That means uhm I have to go into the uh Windows Win dot com and
you'll see whole whole page of Window

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#105:1:A>
But this application now is running what I call seamlessly on the
O S two desk top okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#106:1:A>
This within this box that you see here is all the Windows kind of
uh interface the minimise icon into this manner okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#107:1:A>
Now let's look at an O S two spreadsheet which is the Lotus one
two three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#108:1:A>
By the way the Lotus one two three release two that this one I'm
running is the thirty-two bit application

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#109:1:A>
And I'll touch on the benefits of using thrity-two bit
applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#110:1:A>
Where recently there was an article in the Business Times

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#111:1:A>
I wonder if anyone read uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#112:1:A>
In thirty-two bit we trust or something like that written by Lim
Sin Sin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#113:1:A>
Now this this two spreadsheet is running side by side let me enter
some figure onto this uh Excel side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#114:1:A>
Just some simple number

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#115:1:A>
Let me block it up and say copy then I edit and I paste link over
this side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#116:1:A>
What I'm trying to do here is uh is D D E link okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#117:1:A>
Uhm does anybody know what's D Ding D D E link

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#118:1:A>
In the Windows environment there is this called this link called
Dynamic Data Exchange link okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#119:1:A>
You're able to share data dynamically uhm between two applications
and if you change one the other one should change okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#120:1:A>
Normally what you see happens is between two Windows applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#121:1:A>
Now I'm showing you is one on Windows the other one is on O S two
applications and D D E does work okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#122:1:A>
Now I want to change uhm for example this okay and you see that
side is eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#123:1:A>
Perhaps the numbers you can't see properly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#124:1:A>
Maybe I put it into a chart

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#125:1:A>
Okay this is uh O S two Lotus one two three's chart then I choose
this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#126:1:A>
Uh do I have a three D one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#127:1:A>
Here is a three-D one and can see much better okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#128:1:A>
So you can see that the D D E link data is almost instanteous
update okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#129:1:A>
I'll just like to explain a bit how this is being done so that you
can appreciate that this is not actually as simple as what you see although
you can see that the update is quite fast

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#130:1:A>
First when you do the D D E okay the data has to go into a
clipboard and that went into the Win O S two clipboard first okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#131:1:A>
That's the Windows clipboard maintained by O S two <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-057#X132:1:A>
Now from there when I do a paste paste link over to a a O S twos
application there's another clipboard is being call up and it's active in the
background and we can't see That is the O S two clipboard And information is
passed from uhm the Excel into the clipboard in O S via <unclear> word
</unclear> O S two and passed transferably to O S two's clipboard and goes
out to Lotus one two three's clipboard and all this passing around is
transparent to the user and let alone when you save there's a change in value
all these changes will be go through with this manner okay </X> </I>
