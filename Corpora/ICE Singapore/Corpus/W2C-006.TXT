Lawlessness and insecurity pervade many parts of Cambodia with
frequent clashes between Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh regime soldiers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#2:1>
Our Bangkok correspondent,TAN LIAN CHOO, who was in Cambodia recently,
looks at how residents of Stoung in Kampong Thom Province and UN peacekeepers
are coping.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#3:1>
Khmer Rouge and govt troops bane of key Cambodian town STOUNG (
Kampong Thom Province) - In the day armed soldiers strut about arrogantly
with their AK47 machineguns slung casually over their shoulders.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#4:1>
By nightfall, these soldiers belonging to the Phnom Penh regime are
often drunk and shooting randomly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#5:1>
Here, in the heart of one of Cambodia's most contested territories,
armed clashes between Khmer Rouge fighters and the state of Cambodia's forces
are a way of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#6:1>
Gunfire is often heard throughout the night and residents stay behind
locked doors after 7 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#7:1>
This no longer disturbs Stoung district's nearly 80,000 inhabitants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#8:1>
" But we head for our bunkers when the fighting gets heavy and if
there's shelling from mortar fire," said a 49-year-old woman, Pon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#9:1>
She has three small children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#10:1>
Together they mind a shop selling canned soft drinks and beer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#11:1>
They also grow rice, like all their fellow villagers, and try to make
ends meet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#12:1>
Her survival instincts intact, Ms Pon advised me before she retired
behind her locked door: " If you hear a knock on your door in the middle of
the night, do not open it!" .

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#13:1>
- On March 5, Khmer Rouge fighters approached Stoung from several
directions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#14:1>
There had been heavy shelling for six hours before the Khmer Rouge
entered the town, occupied it for about two hours, ransacking and looting
several houses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#15:1>
The offices of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia
( Untac) were not spared either.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#16:1>
Its civilian police and electoral office in Stoung was ransacked.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#17:1>
Untac personnel had earlier retreated to the bunkers in the
Indonesian peacekeeping battalion compound for safety.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#18:1>
There was no counter-attack by Phnom Penh troops, which had retreated
without any resistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#19:1>
Stoung had no defences and even though Khmer Rouge fighters left the
town after the attack, thousands of residents fled to the provincial capital
about 48 km away.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#20:1>
Shops remained closed for a week and many fleeing families do not
return.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#21:1>
We estimate that about 20 per cent of Stoung's population left and
have not returned because they are too scared," said Lieutenant-Colonel Mark
Walton, head of the UN military observer team in Stoung.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#22:1>
'I suspect the intention of the Khmer Rouge was not to dislodge the
troops of the Cambodian Peoples Armed Forces ( CPAF) but just to let people
know that they are still around in the area and can attack anytime," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#23:1>
Lt-Col Walton, a Briton, was one of the first UN peacekeepers to be
held hostage by the Khmer Rouge last December.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#24:1>
He was freed unharmed after being detained with five other
peacekeepers for nearly a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#25:1>
He noted that the situation in Stoung was very tense.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#26:1>
On the UNTAC military map, it remains marked as a CPAF stronghold.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#27:1>
But UN peacekeepers know that Khmer Rouge bases may be merely 5 km
away.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#28:1>
'In the best of times, the whole area can be described as 'unstable'.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#29:1>
There is a lot of military activity and shelling or random shooting
can take place anytime," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#30:1>
Compounding the already tense situation is the problem of
undisciplined CPAF troops, often loafing around and firing their weapons to
resolve any personal disputes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#31:1>
Earlier this month, a group of CPAF soldiers went to the Stoung
market.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#32:1>
Traders here refused their 50-riel notes, the smallest local currency
denomination officially in circulation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#33:1>
The angry soldiers opened fire above the heads of traders, emptying
several rounds of ammunition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#34:1>
Everyone fled.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#35:1>
" The CPAF soldiers are frightening people with their undisciplined
ways," Lt-Col Walton said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#36:1>
These drunken soldiers are often unruly, demanding cigarettes from
passers-by, and clearly desperate for money.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#37:1>
Most of them have not been paid for months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#38:1>
In contrast, Khmer Rouge soldiers are well-disciplined.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#39:1>
UN military observers said their weapons were always well-maintained
and the men were not distracted by drinking.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#40:1>
" But people here are still very frightened of the Khmer Rouge," said
Lt-Col Walton.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#41:1>
" This comes across all the time".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#42:1>
" Many people say they have buried their voter-registration cards
because they fear being caught by the Khmer Rouge with their cards".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#43:1>
Such fears among residents, largely illiterate and mostly very poor,
are not unfounded.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#44:1>
At the Stoung district hospital, where security cannot be guaranteed,
only eight patients have dared to be warded.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#45:1>
The walls of the hospital are still pock-marked with holes from
machine-gun attacks, the worst of which took place in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#46:1>
Cambodians living in these parts have frequently fled their native
villages whenever fighting flares up.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#47:1>
They are not known to have ideological allegiances and often flee in
the direction of retreating forces, be they Khmer Rouge or troops loyal to
Phnom Penh.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#48:1>
Over the years, Stoung's fleeing inhabitants have joined Cambodia's
swelling internally displaced population which now totals 160,000.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#49:1>
In the Stoung district alone, more than 1,150 families are currently
camping temporarily by Route 6, the main Kampong Thom-Stoung trunk road after
fleeing recent fighting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#50:1>
They have been there for the last three months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#51:1>
These families, which relief officials said amounted to more than
5,000 people, are sleeping under blue plastic sheets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#52:1>
They have not been able to return to their homes in villages situated
15 km north of the road, now under Khmer Rouge control and recently re-mined
by the guerillas.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#53:1>
The Kampong Thom-Stoung road itself is also laid with mines.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#54:1>
Anti-personnel mines are laid every night and removed in the mornings
by CPAF troops.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#55:1>
All Untac and international relief officials have been warned not to
travel on these roads too early or too late in the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#56:1>
Standing safety instructions include avoiding being the first car on
this road on any day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#57:1>
Despite such widespread insecurity and lawlessness, Untac officials
are hopeful that elections can still take place in May.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#58:1>
But so far, UN peacekeepers said, security could be assured for only
five out of 13 planned polling stations. </I>

<h> Practice of human rights will vary among countries: Chuan </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#61:2>
<h> Superiority of norms in more-developed countries a misconceived
idea, says Premier </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#62:2>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#63:2>
Bangkok correspondent

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#64:2>
BANGKOK_There can only be one set of fundamental human rights for
whatever part of the world but approaches to implement these rights must
necessarily vary from country to country, according to Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#65:2>
Opening a five-day regional conference on human rights here
yesterday, Mr Chuan said: " Perception of rights does not exist in pure air.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#66:2>
It is a result of complex inter-actions among several groups in the
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#67:2>
" Therefore, it is natural that approaches to the implementation of
fundamental human rights vary because of differences in socio-economic,
historical, cultural backgrounds and conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#68:2>
The promotion of human rights would be more effective if there is a
clear understanding and recognition of such differences.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#69:2>
" Changes to human rights must emerge primarily from within and not
imposed from outside.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#70:2>
Human rights should also evolve at their own pace if they are to be
peaceful and sustainable.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#71:2>
" Mr Chuan, implicitly responding to criticism by Western countries,
also said it was a " misconceived idea" that human-rights norms in more-
economically-developed countries were superior to those in less-developed
ones.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#72:2>
Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri called for an adjustment of
attitude and methods to improve the existing approach which, he said, often
led to " suspicion and mistrust because of the self-righteous and censorious
attitude usually adopted by the stronger and more developed countries against
the weaker, developing countries".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#73:2>
The Asia-Pacific regional meeting is a preparatory session for the
World Conference On Human Rights, to be held from June 14 to 25 in Vienna and
seeks to boost the United Nations' role in addressing human-rights violations
in member-countries.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#74:2>
The 49 participating countries here, including Singapore, will draft
the Asia-Pacific groups collective position on human rights.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#75:2>
Mr Chuan, who took over last September as Thailand's first elected
Premier, after the Thai military brutally suppressed unarmed pro-democracy
protesters in May, also called for more democratisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#76:2>
" The Inherent inter-relationship between human rights, democracy and
development has become clearly visible.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#77:2>
The need to keep a fair balance between those fundamental components
becomes even more urgent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#78:2>
This is particularly so in a time of greater political and economic
uncertainties in our world today," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#79:2>
He said Asia could play a more prominent role on the world stage if
it ensured that its peoples were provided with their rights and freedoms as
set forth in the United Nations' Charter and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#80:2>
The UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr Ibrahima
Fall, told the conference that in spite of " undeniable progress" in
combating human-rights abuses, much more could be done to make the
implementation of human-rights norms more effective.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#81:2>
Several non-government human-rights organisatians, including the
London-based Amnesty International, are campaigning actively at the Bangkok
meeting.

<h> Fears that transfer of power may be thwarted </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#83:2>
<h> Funcinpec set to be declared winner </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#84:2>
By Tan Lian Choo in Phnom Penh

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#85:2>
PHNOM PENH_The royalist Funcinpec party yesterday emerged as the
virtual overall winner in last week's United Nations-run elections after 90
per cent of the votes were counted, raising fears that extremist elements in
the Phnom Penh regime may resist a transfer of power.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#86:2>
Head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk immediately stepped in as a
mediator, asking the leaders of Funcinpec and the regime's Cambodian People's
Party ( CPP) to meet him over lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#87:2>
Political sources said he was considering a proposal by CPP strongman
Chea Sim that the Prince become the Prime Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#88:2>
Under this plan, the CPP and Funcinpec leaders will be Vice-Premiers
in a coalition government.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#89:2>
However, Funcinpec head Prince Norodom Ranariddh, currently in the
north-western Banteay Meanchey province, is said to be cool to the idea.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#90:2>
" There's a groping behind the scenes for some kind of acceptable
formula for power-sharing," said Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( Untac).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#91:2>
He told The Straits Times in an interview yesterday that Prince
Sihanouk was " very active".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#92:2>
According to Untac, Funcinpec had won 5.7 per cent of votes counted
so far, while the CPP, political arm of the Vietnamese-installed government,
secured 38.1 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#93:2>
Untac said that nearly 3.4 million of the 4.2 million votes had been
counted up to yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#94:2>
The counting of the rest of the votes is expected to be completed
today.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#95:2>
Electoral pundits predict that Funcinpec would emerge with the most
seats and may even secure a simple majority in the 12-member Constituent
Assembly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#96:2>
The CPP would be the second largest party with about 55 seats, but it
threatened on Tuesday to reject the results unless fresh polling was held in
four provinces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#97:2>
Untac election experts said complaints by the CPP about "
irregularities" in balloting were " normal" but they did not merit a new
vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#98:2>
Senior Funcinpec officials playing down their pending electoral
victory because of death threats, yesterday appealed to Untac not to give in
to the 'blackmail" by Phnom Penh leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#99:2>
Said Funcinpec spokesman Prince Norodom Sirivudh, a half-brother of
Prince Sihanouk: " We are very worried.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#100:2>
We have to be prudent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#101:2>
We have asked our representatives in remote areas to halt
temporarily their political activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#102:2>
The latest victims of post-polls violence directed at Funcinpec
followers were a 57-year-old woman and her 23-year-old son.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#103:2>
They were killed by a group of 12 attackers using automatic rifles
while they were in a Funcinpec office in the eastern Prey Veng province.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#104:2>
Five other people were also wounded in that attack, which villagers
alleged had been the work of State of Cambodia policemen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#105:2>
In another violent incident in the central province of Kompong
Chhnang, two Funcinpec activists were said to have been decapitated and
disembowelled.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#106:2>
Official Phnom Penh Radio yesterday announced ominously: " The
current situation is bad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#107:2>
Whatever the election results be, the authority in place will
remain.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#108:2>
" All laws must be enforced strictly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#109:2>
The state of Cambodia and the CPP are trying to resolve the current
bad situation. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X110:2>
We appeal to the people, the army and the police to stay calm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X111:2>
Let there not be chaos." An Untac military expert told The Straits
Times the internal security situation could deteriorate dramatically if Phnom
Penh's army and police forces became fragmented.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X112:2>
The CPP removed its party agents in the counting centres in Kandal,
Battambang and Kompong Cham, all key provinces where it had lost the lead in
the rote count.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X113:2>
The three provinces account for one-third of the seats in the
Constituent Assembly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X114:2>
They are also among the country's most densely-populated and
richest provinces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-006#X115:2>
Loss of control over them would be a major blow to the CPP. </X>
