This year alone music lovers enjoyed more than twenty
international acts performing live in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#2:1:A>
Something quite unheard of before the copyright law was enforced in
nineteen eighty-seven

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#3:1:A>
With the depletion of pirated music record companies have
experienced rising sales

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#4:1:A>
Total sales last year amounted to sixty million dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#5:1:A>
Almost six million cassettes were sold in nineteen ninety and more
than one and a half million CDs bought

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#6:1:A>
The affluence in Singapore and the region has attracted more foreign
performance here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#7:1:A>
Fans of Paul Simon paid between fifty to a hundred and twenty-five
dollars for his recent sold-out concert

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#8:1:A>
Due to huge demand additional rear-seat tickets were sold for thirty
dollars and those were all taken up too

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#9:1:A>
The in-door stadium was filled to the brim in October for a strictly
instrumental performance by saxophonist Kenny G and just month Gloria Estefan
turned the also fully packed stadium into a huge lively party

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#10:1:A>
Concerts are generally regarded as the best way to market an album

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#11:1:A>
But concerts like all marketing tools don't always lead to huge
sales figures especially in a small market like Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#12:1:A>
Among the recent concerts only Kenny G's performance made a major
impact on the album sales

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#13:1:A>
But investment in the exposure and hype of personal appearances
continues because for some the result are long-term

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#14:1:A>
Tommy Page is one example

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#15:1:A>
Most record companies release between ten to twenty albums a month
but concentrate their marketing efforts on only three to five with a
potential to achieve gold or platinum

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#16:1:A>
An album becomes gold in Singapore when sales exceed ten thousand
units

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#17:1:A>
It turns platinum when sales exceed twenty thousand and for more
than forty thousand units sold double platinum

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#18:1:A>
Posters and press ads are the usual medium for marketing new
releases

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#19:1:A>
Record companies which have big names under their label also
benefit from free exposure to boost publicity and album sales

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#20:1:A>
But the most important tool is still the radio

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#21:1:A>
Marketing new releases is made easier for record companies when we
work with sponsors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#22:1:A>
Besides record companies artistes also work with sponsors to market
themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#23:1:A>
Kenny G's concert was backed by Coca Cola and its rival company
Pepsi sponsored Gloria Estefan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#24:1:A>
Sponsorship in music is getting popular among MNCs due to the lure
of instant profits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#25:1:A>
While sponsors help defray cost videos make marketing more
expensive but they help boost sales especially when artistes are photogenic
and can dance and move well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#26:1:A>
Lack of space in music stores also limits the exposure needed to
market new releases

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#27:1:A>
But good news for record companies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#28:1:A>
A new store provides ample display opportunity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#29:1:A>
Opening soon is the Music Power House Singapore's first music
megastore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#30:1:A>
It occupies five thousand and three hundred square feet ten times
the average music store

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#31:1:A>
Over twenty thousand titles will be displayed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#32:1:A>
Music paraphernalia and related items like videos and laser discs
make it a one stop music shopping centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#33:1:A>
Marketing in music will increase in sophistication

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#34:1:A>
But while more megastores may appear whether they will survive in a
small market like Singapore or drop out is something we will have to wait and
see </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#35:2:B>
The songs and activities here to mark world environment day
has attracted quite a crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#36:2:B>
But those who came are mostly young well-informed about the
environment and well students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#37:2:B>
I didn't see many whom you would consider your regular macik and
aunties

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#38:2:B>
I'm talking about the homemakers those who don't usually use
English as a working language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#39:2:B>
For them it appears that the green message hasn't really gotten
through

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#40:2:B>
That seems to be the case from what I found out this past week

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#41:2:B>
I asked several homemakers with some help from a colleague if they
knew for instance why this product with a green label is considered
environmentally friendly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#42:2:B>
Although many of the women we spoke to didn't know about being
green most were in fact unwittingly practicing green habits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#43:2:B>
Many said they sell old newspapers to the 'garang guni' man for
recycling

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#44:2:B>
They did realise that they're actually helping to save the trees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#45:2:B>
Their reasons for doing it are more pragmatic rather than out of a
green concern

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#46:2:B>
So when it comes to making conscious decisions to be green like
buying this kitchen roll made out of recycled paper most would choose on the
basis of which brand they're loyal to and how much it cost

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#47:2:B>
And as for plastic many said they were reusing them for their
rubbish and garbage which again is a green move that they're doing
unwittingly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#48:2:B>
But many don't realise that they should also cut down on the amount
of plastics they use in the first place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#49:2:B>
They don't realise how plastic harms the environment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#50:2:B>
Burning it means releasing dangerous chemicals into the air burying
it in our landfills means they wouldn't decompose for ages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#51:2:B>
So many housewives are still in the dark when it comes to making a
conscious effort to be green

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#52:2:B>
With according to the National Council on the environment there's a
need to get homemakers to be aware of the green movement

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#53:2:B>
In a letter to Talking Point the Council went on to explain that
housewives play a crucial role at the home front

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#54:2:B>
They make nearly seventy to eighty per cent of the decisions with
regards to domestic purchases

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#55:2:B>
Home education has also been largely in the hands of the women and
they're a major influence to their children

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#56:2:B>
According to what the homemakers told me the reason why many of
them don't know about protecting the environment is that most of the green
messages are in English a language which many of them are not well-versed in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#57:2:B>
And true enough I found that while the Ministry of Environment has
multi-lingual messages during Clean and Green Week environmental efforts by
individual groups are almost entirely in English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#58:2:B>
But I found this is because these groups face real constraints in
getting the green message across in other languages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#59:2:B>
For example the Jalan Hijap group an active green group which
printed this useful green directory last year could only come out with an
English version

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#60:2:B>
The group's founder Mrs Cynthia Wee told me why

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#61:2:B>
I met up with Mrs Fatimah Trazil who recently won the Green Leaf
award for her efforts to promote green awareness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#62:2:B>
She told me how else we could overcome the language barrier to
reach the homemakers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#63:2:B>
It's clear that it'll take that special effort to spread the green
message to homemakers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#64:2:B>
But even putting it in different languages is only a start

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#65:2:B>
It'll take more to convince them to make really green choices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#66:2:B>
So we may have to think of other strategies to win over the
homemakers a group which if not reached may undermine all our green efforts
now </I>

You could see Chong Pang city is the first shopping mall in a
HDB estate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#68:3:C>
Gone are the usual narrow walkways the haphazard display of goods
and the cramp shops you find in typical HDB shopping area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#69:3:C>
Instead what you get here is something quite different

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#70:3:C>
And if you're tired after the shopping why not come here to this
amphitheatre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#71:3:C>
It's right in the middle of Chong Pang city

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#72:3:C>
Most of the time it's a convenient playground for the children

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#73:3:C>
But if you come here during the weekends I'm told you'll be treated
to a variety of performances

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#74:3:C>
All these are designed not just to keep up with the times but more
importantly to bring back the crowds and the cash especially when
competition's just next door

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#75:3:C>
Northpoint the latest offering in HDB estate shopping is only five
minutes away from Chong Pang city and it boast major chains like Cold Storage
John Little's and Toys R' Us as well as smaller shops selling everything from
clothes to toys to food

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#76:3:C>
All in air-conditioned comfort and as some would say all under one
roof something shoppers have to expect along with the good bargain

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#77:3:C>
The result while the Chong Pang shops selling necessities like
groceries or food stuff are still doing well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#78:3:C>
Those selling fashion items for example have been badly hit like
Madam Chiang's clothing shop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#79:3:C>
Which is what Mr Loh Koh Choy hopes will happen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#80:3:C>
He's the general manager of the retail promotion centre a committee
set up specially to help the small retailer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#81:3:C>
And if upgrading in Chong Pang can change that the government had
said that other shopping areas like Toa Payoh will in time also be upgraded
to deal with the competition

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#82:3:C>
But before that happens will renovation alone make a difference to
Chong Pang

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#83:3:C>
And this isn't surprising

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#84:3:C>
A recent survey of consumer habits showed that Singaporeans rank
price and quality of product as very important factors while ambience was
rated much lower

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#85:3:C>
So although Chong Pang city does look much better changing the
facet alone isn't going to bring the crowd back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#86:3:C>
What shoppers want is for each shop to sell a wide variety of
quality stuff at good prices something not all shopkeepers seem to realise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#87:3:C>
For instance displaying goods outside the shop may help attract
customers but not if they look as if they've been there for a long time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#88:3:C>
At this shop the prices seem quite reasonable but the range was
somewhat limited

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#89:3:C>
And it certainly didn't help to display the goods this way

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#90:3:C>
And here it was a case of free for all

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#91:3:C>
But often it wasn't only the products and the way they were
displayed that needed upgrading

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#92:3:C>
But that's not what the retail promotion centre thinks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#93:3:C>
Aside from the renovations it also has various schemes to help
retailers one of which is the local enterprise finance scheme which allows
eligible retailers to get a loan of up to eight million dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#94:3:C>
This money can then be used to modernise or expand their business

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#95:3:C>
But to date few have taken advantage of the offer </I>

Since his early teens thirty-one year old Lim Kok Tai has
always enjoyed ending his day like this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#97:4:D>
Though he still enjoys a good run Kok Tai will never forget the
race he took part in five years ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#98:4:D>
Halfway through the race he collapsed from a heat stroke and was
rushed to the hospital

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#99:4:D>
It was a frightening experience but nothing compared to the news
the doctors had for him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#100:4:D>
He had diabetes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#101:4:D>
Like other diabetics Kok Tai suffers from not enough or
ineffective insulant

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#102:4:D>
As a result instead of being changed into energy the glucose level
builds up in his blood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#103:4:D>
And if left untreated this can damage the blood vessels leads to
further complications like heart disease stroke kidney failure and even
blindness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#104:4:D>
Doctor William Chew head and consultant physician in the
Department of Medicine at Alexandra Hospital explain why more Singaporeans
are getting diabetes at a younger age

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#105:4:D>
But while diabetes is more common among people who are overweight
even someone as fit as Kok Tai can also get it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#106:4:D>
Although it's widely believed that diabetes does tend to run in
the family it's still not known exactly how a person's genetic makeup makes
him more prone to getting it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#107:4:D>
But recent findings do point out that compared to people in
Australia the UK and the US more Singaporeans are now getting diabetes
especially among the Chinese Malay and Indian communities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#108:4:D>
Doctors also know that those who don't exercise enough and who
don't watch their diet stand the greatest chance of getting diabetes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#109:4:D>
But whatever the cause for diabetes Kok Tai told me his illness
has certainly affected him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#110:4:D>
Unlike before Kok Tai has to be careful about what he eats

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#111:4:D>
On top of that he has to regularly monitor the glucose level in
his body something all diabetics have to do to keep their condition under
control

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#112:4:D>
At this workshop at Yishore Hospital diabetics and their families
learn the importance of diet healthy cooking exercise and even foot care to
prevent infection

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#113:4:D>
For Kok Tai being able to do something about his condition has
helped him come to terms with the disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#114:4:D>
So although diabetes can't be cured it can be controlled <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-037#X115:4:D>
Well apart from being careful about diet and exercise there's no
reason why diabetics can't carry on as they've done before at work or at play
But if you think about it the precautions that diabetics take really apply to
all of us After all a healthy diet and exercise is the best way to go </X>
