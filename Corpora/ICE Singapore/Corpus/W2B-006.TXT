<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#4:1>
There is more to promoting theatre than simply mounting dance, drama
and music performances.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#5:1>
After a year of existence, NUS Theatre is spreading its wings and
embarking on two new projects, bringing to a higher level its objective of
promoting awareness and understanding of the arts in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#6:1>
The two projects, which are already in motion, are the setting up of a
publications wing and an archive for the arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#7:1>
Come April, the first book to be published by NUS Theatre will make
its appearance in the market: the play Single by Moh Hon Meng will launch the
Theatre's Singapore Play Series.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#8:1>
Following on its heels will be Three Children by Malaysian playwright
Leow Puay Tin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#9:1>
This will be the first in the Southeast Asia Play Series.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#10:1>
The ultimate aim is to foster growth in the arts scene, by raising an
awareness that the arts are not just extra-curricular activities, one-off
performances or socially prestigious events, but are living, breathing forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#11:1>
Publishing plays is only the beginning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#12:1>
Eventually, NUS Theatre hopes to put out other works on culture and
the arts, including academic and critical studies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#13:1>
And while the first publications are in English, it is hoped that
works in other languages will also make their appearance in the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#14:1>
The Chairman of NUS Theatre Working Committee, Dr Tong Chee Kiong,
said: " The point of this is to increase public awareness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#15:1>
We want to make these works easily available and to provide an
opportunity for people to publish works which have not found a market yet".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#16:1>
The ultimate aim is to foster growth in the arts scene, by raising an
awareness that the arts are not just extra-curricular activities, one-off
performances or socially prestigious events, but are living, breathing forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#17:1>
The audience, Dr Tong continued, must eventually have an appreciation
of a performance or work based on a real understanding of its meaning and its
forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#18:1>
This appreciation can only be generated through analytical, critical
and theoretical awareness of the arts, a more rigorous way of viewing and
understanding them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#19:1>
And as NUS Theatre is unique among cultural organisations in that it
has for its base an academic institution, it is in a good position to start
looking at Singapore arts in such ways, as an academic endeavour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#20:1>
This kind of endeavour, in addition to the improvement of standards
in performance and the training of artists and administrators, is crucial for
keeping the arts alive and relevant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#21:1>
Dr Tong pointed out that the arts scene in some other countries such
as the United States is vibrant precisely because practitioners and
academicians have detailed, critical and analytical knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#22:1>
This view of the arts would also affect the audience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#23:1>
The publications wing will continue to publish Arts in Campus, with a
view to making it a lively, viable forum on the arts in Singapore, involving
much of the national arena.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#24:1>
The newsletter has, in fact, grown from its beginnings to become a
link between the arts activities on and off campus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#25:1>
Various cultural groups have offered to collaborate on the
publication, while sponsorship has been pledged as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#26:1>
Feedback has been good too, Dr Tong said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#27:1>
He recalled a comment by a reader that Arts on Campus is an
alternative avenue to The Straits Times for news and views on the arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#28:1>
The second major project, the setting up of an arts archive, is also
in line with NUS Theatre's objectives of looking at the arts in a more
academic way and raising public awareness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#29:1>
The archive will collect artifacts, scripts, videotapes of
performances, photographs and other things associated with arts activities,
in particular the traditional art forms, both within Singapore and in the
Southeast Asia region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#30:1>
NUS Theatre hopes to collect artifacts in an broad a multi-media
arena as possible, and showing as much of the character of the art forms as
possible, including collecting playwrights' notes, copies of scripts with
scribblings, and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#31:1>
" It is necessary to document what is now available in Singapore and
the region, as many of the traditional art forms, given the modern systems we
live in, are in a state of decline," Dr Tong said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#32:1>
If an art form should disappear, and future generations wish to
revive it, the archive would give them the means to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#33:1>
It would also be a research resource for those who want to study and
understand the art forms and cultural practices of the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#34:1>
NUS Theatre has already started working with various organisations on
this project, and has requested for materials from artists and groups in
Singapore and the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#35:1>
They are also looking for plays to publish, thus developing a corpus
of Singapore plays, so that these will not be forgotten after they have been
performed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#36:1>
NUS Theatre hopes that as these projects get off the ground, more
funding and sponsorship will also be given.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#37:1>
" We're not in this for the money.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#38:1>
In fact, we know that we will lose money," Dr Tong commented
realistically.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#39:1>
" But the point is projecting the arts onto public consciousness".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#43:1>
Yet another performing arts centre?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#44:1>
Yes, after such centres as Telok Ayer, Stamford and The Substation,
there is still room for more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#45:1>
But the five groups to be housed in the new centre at Cairnhill Road
- called " One-Two-Six" - which is expected to operate in June 1992, want it
to be more than just a base or a rehearsal space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#46:1>
They hope to turn it into a true arts hub, with frequent activities,
including joint projects; a place where the public can drop in and watch the
artistic process.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#47:1>
The five groups - Act 3, The Necessary Stage, Perkumpulan Seni,
Teater Kami and Cecilia Hon's Ballet Theatre - aim to work closely to achieve
their dream for more artistic collaboration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#48:1>
They plan to hold an annual joint event, perhaps a Theatre Fair,
while at other times of the year, the groups can feed off one another
artistically.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#49:1>
Act 3, for instance, is now working with Cecilia Hon in preparation
for a future production.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#50:1>
When the groups are housed in the same building, it will be much
easier for such collaboration to take place, as the people would not need to
travel from place to place to rehearse, and there can be more communication
between groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#51:1>
" There will be co-ordination between the groups," said Ruby Lim Yang
of Act 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#52:1>
" When one group is doing something, another may be having a lull,
but the liveliness will always be there".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#53:1>
Alvin Tan, president of The Necessary Stage, hope One-Two-Six can be
a place where the public can drop in at any time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#54:1>
One-Two-Six will be a lively cross between The Substation, as it
were, with its programmes involving the public, the other centres, which
operate mainly as rehearsal space and meeting rooms for their tenants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#55:1>
Alvin is, however worried that its distance from the main road may be
a hindrance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#56:1>
He said: " At present, there is no place for staging cultural events
in the Orchard Road area, unlike Shenton Way.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#57:1>
We hope we can have lunchtime performances in One-Two-Six, but there
may be a problem getting an audience".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#58:1>
Still, he hopes that the public will come once word gets around.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#59:1>
There will be at least one performance area at One-Two-Six, at Act 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#60:1>
The Necessary Stage hopes to turn two adjoining rehearsal rooms into
a " large open space: for performances and play-readings as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#61:1>
For all the groups, the new premises mean that they hold more
activities-workshops, exhibitions, performances - and to have these
activities on a larger scale.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#62:1>
For Teater Kami and Perkumpulan Seni, in particular, the move is
significant as they do not have a fixed base to rehearse in or operate from
at the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#63:1>
Roslan Badron, co-ordinator of Teater Kami, said: " We feel very
excited.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#64:1>
With this base, we hope in a few years to go fulltime".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#65:1>
Also, he said, the group can now put up more productions every year,
adding: " It will be a new experience for us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#66:1>
With One-Two-Six, we can exchange ideas, stagecraft, experiences.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#67:1>
We can learn much".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#68:1>
Encik Abdul Ghani Hamid, vice-president of Perkiumpulan Seni, said
that his group has interests in drama, music, art and literature, but its
activities have been limited by its lack of space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#69:1>
They plan to hold drama and writing workshops, as well as art
classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#70:1>
" And why not make use of the walls as well, to hold art
exhibitions?" he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#71:1>
" A lot of young artists need space to show their works, the museum
is always all booked up, and art galleries have many conditions for artists
who want to exhibit their works".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#72:1>
Art exhibitions are also part of The Necessary Stage's plans, besides
starting a playwrights' programme, reading-cum-improvisation sessions with
directors and writers to develop plays, and the creation of a repertory
theatre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#73:1>
There is also the idea of mounting art/photographic exhibitions
together with plays or readings, dealing with a particular theme.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#74:1>
For this, The Necessary Stage plans to approach other groups and
artists to work with.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#75:1>
For Act 3, the new premises are a natural next step in their
development, which is to work the theatre company to its maximum.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#76:1>
With more space, quantity and quality can be improved.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#77:1>
Although Act 3 is grateful for its current headquarters, which was
set up with the help of the Ministry of Community Development, the place is
still a little too cramped to accommodate a theatrical space, an office, a
workshop, and a costume rental department.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#78:1>
With One-Two-Six, their current base will be turned into a theatre
designed to accommodate their young patrons, while the reat of the office
will move into the adjoining building, the main part of One-Two-Six.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#79:1>
The groups are pleased with the nominal rent at One-Two-Six.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#80:1>
It would mean freeing funds for more artistic development.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#81:1>
Cecilia Hon's Ballet Theatre, for instance, has had to rent rehearsal
rooms for its classes, at the Drama centre and The Substation, since it moved
out of its former premises at Paradiz Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#82:1>
Miss Hon said that it is not always easy to book the Drama Centre
rehearsal rooms, which cost her
&dollar;40 for four hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#83:1>
" With the new place, we can have many activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#84:1>
We can hold our exams there, and have ballet, tap, jazz and exercise
classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#85:1>
It can be used for rehearsals for our performances too," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#86:1>
Another economy of scale that can be achieved is in terms of
publicity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#87:1>
Each group, in mentioning " One-Two-Six" in its publicity, can
generate a higher profile for its fellow tenants as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#88:1>
With joint activities which may even include fundraising, every group
stands to gain in terms of public awareness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#89:1>
The groups talk of their current " administrative synergy" turning
into " artistic synergy".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#90:1>
One-Two-Six, they hope, will have a special spirit, but with each
group retaining its own identity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#91:1>
A positive aspect of their outlook is that they are open to other
groups using the facilities and working together with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#92:1>
" The arts community is very small," said Ruby Lim Yang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#93:1>
" We hope there will be more arts hubs in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#94:1>
It is never enough to say " Oh, there's The Substation, there's Telok
Ayer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#95:1>
The arts must spread, like mushrooms".

<h> Chow Yun Fat heralds new Asian face in film </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#97:1>
by Koh Buck Song

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#98:1>
Hong Kong actor Chow Yun Fat looks like he will make a lasting impact
in America.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#99:1>
Perhaps not right now, but soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#100:1>
His Hollywood debut movie, The Replacement Killers, seems unlikely
to be an immediate blast.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#101:1>
At under 1 1/2 hours, it is too short and gives Chow too few lines to
extend his range as a dramatic actor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#102:1>
But his achievement in getting so far, with the promise of two more
movies on the way, will certainly help give Asian culture the world attention
it has lacked so far.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#103:1>
The action film, which opened here two Thursdays ago and also stars
Mira Sorvino ( of Mighty Aphrodite fame), has some elements that should make
it stand out. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-006#X104:1>
The slow-motion action sequences, inspired by Hollywood director
John Woo, belong in a string of movies in the mould of Woo's recent hit,
Face/Off, starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. </X> </I>
