<h> Ways of Imaging and Arranging the World </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#6:1>
The entrepreneur must continue to further himself and his resources in
order to build up his empire.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#7:1>
There was always an image of growth, from " small trees to forests" (
1) on which he envisaged his business would eventually become.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#8:1>
Doing business has been compared by our interviewees with building a
house, which must first begin with a solid foundation before the rest is
constructed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#9:1>
Ng Teow Yhee the entrepreneur saw himself as the key personality in
realizing his vision, as the " driving force", the leader on the frontline,
the protector of his workers.(2) He had to exhibit leadership, courage and
empathy with the workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#10:1>
These qualities allowed him to win the admiration of his workers and,
more importantly, to " control" their allegiance and employment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#11:1>
As he evolved out of nascent entrepreneurship and into a more
advanced stage of business development, what seemed particularly important in
intrapersonal competence was leadership; in interpersonal competence, a moral
code of " thinking" and " doing" good which formed the bonds between
employers and employees, and between business partners; in technical
competence, an ability to organize and rationalize the firm towards a certain
degree of " modernism"; and in entrepreneurial competence, an aptitude to be
in tune with evolving influences internationally as well as locally in order
to seize opportunities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#12:1>
This was the period of a " post-migrant" existence, when the sinkheh
metamorphosed from a common worker towards becoming a boss of his own, on
this pioneers' land which he would henceforth call his " home" and his
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#13:1>
This was the period where his business vision was being
systematically concretized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#14:1>
The World Begins with Me What was most evident in most of the oral
history interview transcripts was the significant role the interviewees gave
to themselves, rather than the organization, in creating the best working
conditions for the workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#15:1>
There was a strong belief in personal charisma and leadership, a
belief that, by and large, he alone had brought about his own success.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#16:1>
There was also an equally strong notion of worker allegiance and
commitment to him - and a belief that the social relations at the workplace
could be somewhat similar to those of a " family" situation whereby the
father / employer reigned, took care of, and guided the children / workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#17:1>
The impetus for articulating and erecting a familial form of
management style owed its origin to a fundamental world-view the entrepreneur
had about the social and cosmic world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#18:1>
For many years, the individual saw himself as the driving force; he
learned that by reaching out, he could bring in more capital or human
resources; by bringing in, he preserved; and by preserving, he could expand
and reach out again.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#19:1>
He was continually perfecting himself through learning and the
acquisition of worldly knowledge and experience which formed the
preconditions for his exploitation and conquest of the world, much in the
same way they once went to the mountains and seas back in the villages in
China to exploit natural resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#20:1>
Quek Xin's transcript was noted for the address he gave to his entire
clan at a dinner in 1955, where he succinctly summarized his worldview.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#21:1>
His world vision began with self-betterment and self-cultivation -
working hard, and not being selfish and wayward, followed by social harmony
in the family.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#22:1>
As said by his son: Before my father Quek Xin died, he left behind a
family legacy which was on tape, a legacy to instruct the children in the
clan to follow:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#23:1>
1) Everyone in the family must remember his ancestors; when you drink
water, you must remember and be grateful to its source.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#24:1>
2 All family members, old or young, must be loving, cooperative,
united and at peace with one another in order to enhance the prosperity and
progress of the family.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#25:1>
3 The men in the family as well as in the clan must work hard and not
be lazy, self-seeking and wayward.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#26:1>
4 Everyone in the family, old and young, must seek further education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#27:1>
Every male or female family member must have at least secondary level
education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#28:1>
5 The Quek family will organize an Education Fund to assist poorer
kinfolk to further their studies; any good youth can appeal to this Fund for
aid in furthering their education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#29:1>
6 Any male kin can borrow from this Fund but once he has completed
his education and started to work, he must try to pay back his loan in order
to keep this Fund going.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#30:1>
7 The mother of Kai Si was, from many years of my observation, a kind
wife and a good mother because she was so uncomplaining.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#31:1>
In any case, women should not interfere in anything that concerns big
business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#32:1>
8 I have the intention of donating
&dollar;10,000 to the Quek Clan Education Fund.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#33:1>
9 1 am feeling old and weak.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#34:1>
After I die, I hope Kai Teng and Kai Yuan will follow my wishes and
carry them out as well as cherish all that I said.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#35:1>
l0 I wish everyone of you will continue to strive to be wealthy and
powerful, in order to glorify the name and fortune of the Quek family.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#36:1>
( 3) What was interesting in the Quek's family legacy was the
importance given to education as the vehicle toward self-perfection.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#37:1>
Quek's own children were highly educated, some completing their
studies in Germany and America and the younger ones, in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#38:1>
Quek also encouraged clan members to strive and better themselves in
diverse professions so that the community could produce complementary talents
for building a stronger and united community vis-a-vis other dialect
communities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#39:1>
His ethnic chauvinism was not exclusive; the school he set up in
Malacca openly admitted children from all dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#40:1>
His national interests were both Malayan as well as Chinese; he was
as involved in the clan activities in Malacca as he was in helping develop
Hainan Island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#41:1>
For Quek Xin, the ultimate glory was to see Hainan Island develop
into a prosperous province; he would especially wish that the Quek clan in
China or overseas play a significant role in realizing that goal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#42:1>
Quek's world-view called for a hard-driving and achievement oriented
individual, functioning within a harmonious social order in the family, the
community and the state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#43:1>
It was basically a Confucian social order.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#44:1>
He hoped that future generations will continue his tasks; what one
generation could not achieve, the next generation must pick up, move on, and
do better.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#45:1>
<h> Extending Outwards </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#46:1>
When workers started their own businesses and became nascent
entrepreneurs, they still relied heavily on the family as the earliest source
of labour, exerting autocratic forms of paternalism on it and other close
relatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#47:1>
When our entrepreneurs continued to expand and their businesses grew,
their immediate family members still formed the inner core of management and
ownership, with cousins and relatives forming the outer rings of management
control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#48:1>
Their pattern of social organization was aimed at transforming
secondary relationships into primary ones in order to establish a form of
paternalistic control underlined by mutual reciprocity, commitment and
loyalty.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#49:1>
Yet our entrepreneurs could not be contented with doing business with
only their family or lineage members, thus being necessarily handicapped by
numbers and their suitability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#50:1>
They had to select and recruit, from wider networks, non-kin,
preferably people from the same district or province, people who could be
trusted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#51:1>
Our entrepreneurs had to exercise a high degree of flexibility and
willingness to assimilate in order to establish these extra-parochial
connections, characteristics which a historian, Ng Chin Keong, argued as
responsible for the commercial success of the Hokkiens.(4) As a leader, the
entrepreneur continually hunted for talent and human abilities by bringing
people in through marriages and the offering of position and status.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#52:1>
His business empire was basically an extension of self as well as an
incorporation of talented " others" into family.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#53:1>
The " family phantom" effect, some twenty years after the teenagers'
departure from their villages, exerted itself again in our post-migrant
entrepreneurs, who, by then, were busy creating their own families after
their physical disengagement from their family homes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#54:1>
Like growing young trees, doing business had a compelling momentum of
its own.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#55:1>
The entrepreneur had to use all his competences to stretch and reach
out in all directions, seizing business opportunities which were " good and
profitable".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#56:1>
As one entrepreneur, Ang Keong Lan, said, " If one does not advance,
one has to retreat, and if one retreats, one has to close down."(5) But, in
order to expand, one needs people, including those who are not family.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#57:1>
Once social relations fell out of the orbit of kinship affiliations,
it became all the more difficult to manage and control them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#58:1>
Our pioneers solved this problem by personalizing or " family-izing"
these social relations: My thinking is not like the old ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#59:1>
It is wrong to treat workers only as productive digits to whom you
pay monthly salaries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#60:1>
Every worker will have a day when he can make good for himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#61:1>
We have to treat workers like our own family members, like our own
brothers.(6) Tay Kia Hong treated his Malay factory manager " like a
brother", he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#62:1>
Together, they experimented to perfect the colour and texture of
leather work but, despite hard work and suffering, there was no success.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#63:1>
Those years, however, forged strong bonds between the two, and he
recalled his friendships with two other employees " to be like brothers".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#64:1>
In recollecting the past, he said: Mr Shih came from China.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#65:1>
When I first met him some thirty years ago, I knew he was a good man
so I enlisted his help.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#66:1>
Now Mr Shih heads one of our food companies and he is sometimes sent
overseas to look after my other interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#67:1>
I am very fortunate to get someone like him.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#68:1>
He is smart but not proud.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#69:1>
I treasure him more than jewels for I know how hard it is to get
talented staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#70:1>
I am grateful to him for his loyalty, and he is grateful to me for
treating him like a brother.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#71:1>
Indeed, in all these years, our relationship has grown to be more
like that of brothers, than that of employer and employee.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#72:1>
That's why I take great interest in his personal life and share in
his troubles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#73:1>
My wife's brother has been with me since he was little.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#74:1>
We know each other so well and treat each other like brothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#75:1>
When he makes mistakes, my wife and I would talk to him openly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#76:1>
Similarly, I would listen to him with an open mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#77:1>
So three of us hold frequent discussions to determine the best
approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#78:1>
These joint decisions bonded us and were really the secret of our
success.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#79:1>
I do not believe in authoritarianism nor do I make my own decisions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#80:1>
I discuss with them and if we all think the decision is right, we
would go ahead with our plans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#81:1>
If I am wrong, they will explain to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#82:1>
This explains why we have achieved something.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#83:1>
For all these years, we have not had any misunderstanding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#84:1>
I am so happy for that ( 7).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#85:1>
Forced by necessity, many entrepreneurs had to turn to other ethnic
workers as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#86:1>
Unlike entrepreneurs in some specific trades who set up economic
closures by barring the entry of non-family members and " outsiders" into the
same industry based on discriminatory principles of kinship and
particularistic ties,(8) most Singaporean enterprises, for example, Yeo Hiap
Seng's, had to rely on non-family as well as other ethnic members for their
labour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#87:1>
When Yeo Hiap Seng went into canning satay sauce, Malays were
employed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#88:1>
However, this need to expand the company by including non-family
members did not necessarily mean that the entrepreneur would stop trying to "
family-ize" work relations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#89:1>
One entrepreneur, Ho Rih Hwa, spoke of his foreign employees in an
overseas business venture in an intimate, familial manner, echoing a degree
of familiarity built up from many years of business association and trust.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#90:1>
His basic dictum of interpersonal management was: " If you suspect a
man, don't use him; if you use a man, don't suspect him." <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#X91:1>
Trustworthiness was an important attribute he wanted to cultivate in
an employee; equally important was the need for his own overarching "
paternalistic" role in overseeing, if not directly supervising, his
employees' business decisions and development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#X92:1>
He said: I spent about twenty years in Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#X93:1>
During this time, I got to know all my staff very well and vice
versa-they knew me very well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#X94:1>
When you operate for so long, you get to know your staff, not only
their working capacity, you know their mind, their temperament as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-019#X95:1>
And you know who is trustworthy, who is not, what position you can
trust him in.
