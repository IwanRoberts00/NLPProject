Q1 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#2:1>
To understand what King
Zi's view on what it is to be human, it is imperative to first understand his
view concerning " what is more in human life than meets the eye".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#3:1>
Although it is undeniable that King Zi does not discuss
about " strange phenomena, violence, chaos and gods", King Zi does have a
religious conviction about " what is more". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#4:1>
He
uncritically accept the traditional idea that Tian, or heaven, is the source
of all things, including human culture. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#5:1>
Tian is
intrinsically benevolent; Tian cares for the people. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#6:1>

King Zi declares that 'Tian produced the te ( virtue) in me'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#7:1>
In other words, te is the personal presence of Tian
within. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#8:1>
Originally te was regarded as a inborn capacity
possessed by the rulers and shamans through which the behaviours of others
could be influenced. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#9:1>
But King Zi innovatively proclaims
that everybody, both rulers and commoners, has this te endowed by Tian and
hence, everyone has the both the capacity and responsibility to cultivate
benevolence as Tian is benevolent. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#10:1>
As such, King Zi
thinks that to be human is to be a man of benevolence or as he calls it, a
noble man ( in Mandarin). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#11:1>
Another metaphysical or
religious conviction integral to King Xi's worldview is the metaphor of
family. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#12:1>
King Xi, as a transmitter of ancient heritage,
believes that the whole world and all there is within, consist of a big
family. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#13:1>
Tian is reminiscent to the more ancient notion
of Shan Ti ( collective presence of ancestral spirits) and Tian cares for the
people. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#14:1>
The emperor as the son of Tian is charged with
the parenting role to take care of the people. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#15:1>
So,
another way fo conceiving of being human is, for King Xi, to be a responsible
family member. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#16:1>
To be a man of benevolence and to be a
family member are two sides of the same coin. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#17:1>

Benevolence is an existential goal and it refers to the perfection of human
excellence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#18:1>
Everyone is endowed by Tian the capacity
to engage in ethical cultivation but everyone is not therefore automatically
man of benevolence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#19:1>
Efforts, will, decision are all
needed to be invoked to make the inborn capacity or moral sensibility to
flourish and attain human perfection or benevolence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#20:1>

The root of benevolence is Xiao ( filial piety). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#21:1>
This
ordered family affection is a natural impulse. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#22:1>
When
this impulse is consciously developed and cultivated, it has the potential to
develop into Jen ( benevolence). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#23:1>
However, beside this
natural impulse. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#24:1>
there are other selfish impluse, if
unchecked, might impede the extension and development of the natural
affection of Xiao. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#25:1>
So, discipline, effort and constant
choice are all indispensable ingredients in the process of ethical
cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#26:1>
It is interesting to note that King Xi
believe that the records of the way of the ancient sage king provides the
blueprint of how heaven ( Tian) live and more in this world.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#27:1>
Through the ancient record, we can see that the
chou-li ( Rites) are the crystalisations of Tian's way which means that the
former sage king had somehow comprehended Tian's way and codified it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#28:1>
Since Li is the blue-print of how Tian moves and lives
in this world, to revive the former way of the ancient sage king or rather,
to order the kingdom according to Tian's way, all that is needed is to
perform the rites according to the proper inner ethical attitudes or spirit.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#29:1>
However the ancient rites are not comprehensive
enough, and I wonder it would ever be, to provide definitive guidance to
every daily mundane decision. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#30:1>
This is where conscious
rational thought come in. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#31:1>
King Xi thinks that it is
imperative for every human to put the interest of the whole above the self
and do what is appropriate ( Mandarin word). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#32:1>
According
to King Xi, an individual's greatest responsibility, as Lao Szu King rightly
perceives, is not on one's success and failures which are determined by Ming
( Heaven's decree) but on ethical cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#33:1>
King Zi
unapologetically assumes that what distinguishes man from all other things is
man's inborn capacity to engage in ethical cultivation and it is only
appropriate ( or human) to devote one's whole life's energies in ethical
cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#34:1>
Lao Zi would not dispute that the natural
order, which he calls Tao, while King Xi calls Tian, is inherently good.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#35:1>
He also would concur that we should respect the way of
the former sage king. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#36:1>
But he disagree that man's
greatest responsibility is to engage in ethical cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#37:1>
He thinks that man's greatest responsibility is to
return to the Tao and the way to do it is to employ " non action" - actions
without effort. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#38:1>
I hasten to add that although Tao
Tzu's conception of " how" to cultivate or perfect our being human is
different from King Xi, both converge on the point that human should live and
move in the way of the natural order. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#39:1>
Tao Tzu also
differs in his view concerning Li ( rites). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#40:1>
He accepts
the way of the former sage king but he is sceptical about the claim that it
can be codified. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#41:1>
He regards the performance of Li not
as irrelevant but even as contrary to the interests of being human.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#42:1>
Furthermore, while King Xi encourages conscious
rational thought in discriminating the good from the bad, he asserts that one
should make no distinction and cease the wavering mind from having cognitive
functions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#43:1>
As for a Chan buddhist, he would think that
ethical cultivation is a mere tool to prepare one to " see into one's buddha
directly" and obviously, he would say that this is just a secondary
responsibility. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#44:1>
For a Chan, the greatest
responsibility of man is to attain enlightenment which is also the
extinguishing of selfish desires. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#45:1>
The second part of
the above discussion focuses mainly on the differences of the conceptions of
how to perfect our being human according to the 3 perspectives.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#46:1>
It does not mean that they have no similarity at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#47:1>
One salient similarity is the common believe that one
needs to put the interests of the whole, whether conceived of as Tian, Tao or
SELF ( the ultimate reality), above self and not to give free reign to
selfish and debased desires. </I>

Q2 ( Section B) 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#49:2>
King Zi
regards himself as a transmitter of ancient heritage and not an innovator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#50:2>
In this essay, I will elucidate the content of the
ancient heritage, he transmits and the way in which he has contributed his
innovative insights in this interpretations of the ancient heritage.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#51:2>
King Zi is a Ru scholar. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#52:2>
As a
ru, he is well versed in the records of ancient heritage which consist
mainly, though not solely, of ancient rites and historical facts.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#53:2>
He is convinced that the reason why the former sage
kings like Yao ( Mandarin) and Shun ( Mandarin) had brought peace and harmony
to the kingdoms was because they had somehow grasped the way of Tian; they
had codified the way of Tian and came out with a comprehensive set of rites
which mirror how Tian moves and lives in this world. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#54:2>

Since this rites have a metaphysical origin, they are natural in the sense it
has the power to humanize and shape those who participate in it, and not
artificial. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#55:2>
This is perhaps why Figarate calls these
holy rites or sacred ceremonies. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#56:2>
it is possible to
argue that what is innovative about King Zi's view is that he asserts that it
is only through the cultivation of Jen that would infuse the performance of
Li with the required spirit and through which, the Li would be enlivened and
as a result, could radiate its spiritual power and bring peace and harmony to
the land. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#57:2>
However, as Benjamin Schwartz succinctly
points out that even in some of the preconfucian texts, the idea of " te"
with an ethical connotation was already present. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#58:2>
" Te"
originally was believed to be a inborn capacity of the ruler.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#59:2>
If a ruler through ethical choice and effort makes his
" te" illustrious, then he would be able to receive the mandate to rule from
heaven. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#60:2>
So, it is evident that even before confucian,
there was already the belief that the performance of Li, especially by the
ruler, needs to be accompanied with the proper inner ethical attitude and
spirit. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#61:2>
What is new about King Zi's idea, is that he
extends the privilege of ethical cultivation and the potential of achieving
ethical perfection to the commoners. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#62:2>
Before him, it
was thought that " te" is the exclusive privilege of the members of the
ruling clan. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#63:2>
But King Zi audaciously assert that
everyone can be a man of benevolence and everyone has the inborn capacity and
responsibility to engage in ethical cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#64:2>
In
fact, the notion of " noble man" ( in Mandarin) denotes only the sons of
rulers, but King Xi converts it into an ethical notion, that represent an
ethical ideal of human excellence of which all man should strive for.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#65:2>
Another credit that King Xi deserves is that he gives
the most detail teachings of how to cultivate Jen, even until today.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#66:2>
Despite the fact that he gives no single exhaustive
definition to explicate Jen, he produces different numerations of how Jen
should be practiced in different specific contexts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#67:2>
In
my opinion, King Xi greatest contribution lies with his careful and in-depth
teaching of how to practice Jen. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#68:2>
It is noteworthy that
King Xi's notion of Jen is also new and yet continuous with what came before.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#69:2>
Professor Lin Yu Sheng notes that the word " Jen"
already appears in " The book of poetry" which, perhaps means " true
manhood". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#70:2>
What is unmistakable is that " Jen"
originally refers only a particular virtue. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#71:2>
But in
King Xi's hands, he extends its meanings to encompass all particular virtues.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#72:2>
As a result, for King Xi, Jen is a notion denoting the
ultimate perfection of human excellence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#73:2>
As Schwartz
observes, Jen became an existential goal that one should constanyl strive for
though it seems that one never reaches. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#74:2>
I am aware
that there are those who thinks that King Xi's greatest innovation is his
conception of Xi and Fingarette is a case in point. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#75:2>
In
my view, this is factually erroneous. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#76:2>
In the first
place, in King Xi's time, though there were neglect and misapplication of Li,
yet it is undeniable that on the whole, Li was still widely practiced since
it is part of the ancient Chinese culture. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#77:2>
As Schwartz
argues, King Xi expresses concern only when there is " a discrepancy" between
the form and the spirit of Li. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#78:2>
Moreover, as Waley
rightly discerns the Analects do not focus on the details of Li but if is a
book which primarily focused on " the general principles of moralities".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#79:2>
In conclusion, what is new and yet continuous with
what came before is King Xi's ideas that everybody has the capacity to
cultivate Jen and it is through the cultivation of Jen that Li could be
enliven. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#80:2>
When Li is enliven, the former way of the
ancient sage king would be revived and its spiritual force would be unleased.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#81:2>
Without the accompaniment of Jen, Li would degenerate
into empty forms and this is what King Xi adhors. </I>

Q6 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#83:3>
A perfect man has no
name, no achievement and no use. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#84:3>
A perfect man has no
name because the Tao, the ultimate reality that the perfect man gain mystical
union with, has no name. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#85:3>
Names are used to refer to a
particular thing or characteristic but the Tao is all-embracing.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#86:3>
It is in everything and everything is in the Tao.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#87:3>
A perfect man has no achievement because like the Tao,
he claims no credit for himself. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#88:3>
He has no use or to
be specific, he is useless because he does not confine and subject himself to
the artificial norms and man made standards. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#89:3>
A perfect
man is also one who is not found by human limitations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#90:3>

He could roam about in the universe and ride on the " normalities of the six
elements". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#91:3>
He is free and eternally happy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#92:3>
Unplagued by negative human emotions, he has no wordly
worries and cares. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#93:3>
But what must one do to become a
perfect man? <X> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#X94:3>
Zhuang Zi tells us: fast the mind.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#X95:3>
How? 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#X96:3>
Transcend all finite
points of view. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#X97:3>
Make no distinction.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-013#X98:3>
Don't affirm this or negate that for all is relative.
</X> </I>
