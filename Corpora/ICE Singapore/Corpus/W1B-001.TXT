<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#2:1>
10/11/91

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#3:1>
It was very nice of you to call just now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#4:1>
Wasn't expecting it from you at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#5:1>
Was a pleasant surprise to hear your voice again from the other end of
the line.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#6:1>
Hope you caught enough sleep after the call and woke up in time for
worship service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#7:1>
Was also surprised to learn that Philip told you I was not well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#8:1>
It was thoughtful of him to keep you informed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#9:1>
It was nothing serious, really.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#10:1>
You shouldn't be worrying about it at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#11:1>
In fact, don't worry too much about us in S'pore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#12:1>
We're amongst friends and relatives...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#13:1>
you're the one we should be worried about as you're away from home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#14:1>
Good thing your sis is loving and accommodating.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#15:1>
You've not mentioned much about the other members in your sis' house.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#16:1>
How are you getting along with them?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#17:1>
You mentioned that you were pretty shaken-up in the past weeks.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#18:1>
Was it because of your mom's condition?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#19:1>
Were there some other factors?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#20:1>
It's good that your buddies are still in touch with you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#21:1>
We've not met or heard from each other after your departure.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#22:1>
How are they?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#23:1>
Gary mentioned to you at the airport that he might visit you next
year: Has he decided?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#24:1>
Well, as for the jogging, don't overdo it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#25:1>
You know how bad your knee cap can become.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#26:1>
There are always other forms of exercises in order to keep fit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#27:1>
Don't hurt your knee just because both you and Thomas want to
compete.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#28:1>
Leave it to your own discretion...you should know your own body
better than anyone else.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#29:1>
You needn't be anxious about Soh Mui and I.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#30:1>
Misunderstandings are bound to happen in any relationship, or
friendship for that matter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#31:1>
Even arguments and sometimes quarrels ( not that we have any yet) may
be healthy in the development of friendship.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#32:1>
It's all part and parcel of life.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#33:1>
No need to so quickly blame yourself for anything that happens
between Soh Mui and I.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#34:1>
We are responsible to each other for our friendship; you are not
responsible to us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#35:1>
But, please do not be mistaken, it's not that I do not appreciate
your good intentions, it's a matter of principle.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#36:1>
It's not just about forgiving and forgetting.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#37:1>
There is nothing to forgive or forget about, really.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#38:1>
I've been thru' many friendships, well, most of us have.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#39:1>
I've seen the best and the worst and I'm prepared for both.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#40:1>
Friends disappoint and we disappoint our friends too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#41:1>
We all have different expectations.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#42:1>
It has to be mutual for a healthy friendship to develop and grow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#43:1>
And, no one can tell any one else to comply with his/her
expectations.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#44:1>
By the way, what were you apologizing about ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#45:1>
Because I was not informed about your mom's illness and
hospitalization ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#46:1>
I really hope I've not conveyed the wrong message.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#47:1>
I'm not a good communicator, and might have written something not
meant to mean what it looks like, or something which is open to
misinterpretation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#48:1>
Whatever it is, please be assured that I've not taken offence for not
being informed about your mom.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#49:1>
In one of your letters, you sounded very upset about not being
informed of your mom's operation and hospitalization and that you have to
find out about it from your eldest brother, Stephen.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#50:1>
I felt obliged then, to explain that I was also unaware of the
matter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#51:1>
Perhaps, in my haste to explain myself, I've caused some
misunderstandings.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#52:1>
I really did not mind whether I was informed or not.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#53:1>
Thinking back, there was no reason why I should be so anxious in
explaining myself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#54:1>
May be due to self-centredness; didn't want to be blamed for not
informing you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#55:1>
Well, if I've caused any confusion, please accept my apologies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#56:1>
What have you planned for Christmas and New Year ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#57:1>
Anything exciting coming up ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#58:1>
Hope you're not just burying your head in the books and not mingling
around, getting to know more friends.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#59:1>
Is PBC putting up anything special, like an evangelistic musical?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#60:1>
Well, True Way will be putting up one on 20 and 21 December.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#61:1>
The theme is " The Reason for the Season".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#62:1>
Hopefully, I'll be able to bring one or two friends along.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#63:1>
Have also bought some coupons for a Christmas fun fair which will be
held in Clementi from 21 24 Dec.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#64:1>
The fair is organised jointly by a church and the Community Chest.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#65:1>
The church ( St John's and St Margaret's) has planned various
outreach programmes for the fun fair.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#66:1>
I feel that it is a good effort.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#67:1>
Hearts are generally more open and receptive during the Christmas
Season.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#68:1>
Hopefully through this event, the seed of the Gospel may be planted
in the hearts of many.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#69:1>
I'm planning to bring my mom to the fair.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#70:1>
Shouldn't be too difficult since it is not held in the premises of a
church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#71:1>
She's not likely to be converted in such an event, but at least,
hopefully, she's going to have an enjoyable time and be more exposed to
Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#72:1>
I've always had mixed feelings during this time of the year, with
Christmas coming and the end of the year round the corner.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#73:1>
As people start to decorate and celebrate Christmas, I always feel a
tinge of sadness amidst the festivities.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#74:1>
Do they know what they are celebrating?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#75:1>
Do they know where they are heading?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#76:1>
More personally, do I know where I'm heading?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#77:1>
Sometimes I feel this sense of loss of direction, even loss of
meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#78:1>
But, must man always find a meaning in what he does.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#79:1>
If not, he is merely existing for existing's sake.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#80:1>
There must be more to life.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#81:1>
Hope you do not find it shocking that I, a Christian, should be
writing this.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#82:1>
More importantly, hope I do not become your stumbling block.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#83:1>
Does it sound like I'm giving up my faith?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#84:1>
To assure you, no.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#85:1>
I believe in God from flowers and bees and birds, I know God exists.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#86:1>
What is His purpose for me on earth?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#87:1>
I do not want to blindly follow the currents of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#88:1>
But, very often, I feel so helpless.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#89:1>
Is it because I'm not strong enough?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#90:1>
Inside me I know I'll never be satisfied until I find an answer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#91:1>
But will I?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#92:1>
May be I'm just too anxious, lacking in faith.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#93:1>
May be I should just live life as it comes, day by day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#94:1>
Do you know what you're living for?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#95:1>
Hope you don't find this question too personal.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#96:1>
I'm just throwing questions in the air...you need not answer the
question.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#97:1>
This " year-end phenomena" has never bothered me this much in past
years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#98:1>
Strange.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#99:1>
Guess it could be due to age.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#100:1>
It could be the cause of the pressing need to know where I'm heading
before I run out of time, before it is too late.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#101:1>
I do not want to come to a stage when I look back and discover to my
horror that I've wasted half my life doing what I should not or not supposed
to do.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#102:1>
Like the Book of Ecclesiastes says " for all is vanity and a
striving after wind".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#103:1>
Hm...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#104:1>
Maybe, I'll be able to find some answers in the Book of
Ecclesiastes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#105:1>
Maybe I should not be too disheartened, for even the most wise of
kings, Solomon, had similar feelings!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#106:1>
It's very likely that I may quit from my present job in NUS early
next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#107:1>
I've not decided what to do next.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#108:1>
I may contemplate a drastic career change.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#109:1>
I may also take a month or two's break, go on a tour before I start
hunting for another job.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#110:1>
Hopefully I'll be able to strike a balance between economic survival
and job satisfaction in the next job.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#111:1>
Childcare may be one line that I may go into.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#112:1>
I'm fully aware of the drastic salary cut, so, before plunging into
it, I may help out in a friend's childcare centre for a few weeks just to get
some first hand experience and find out if that's what I really want to do.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#113:1>
Yet another option is to go back to some fulltime studies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#114:1>
This last option is more just a dream.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#115:1>
Well, no harm dreaming at times.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#116:1>
This brings to mind the film " are to Dream".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#117:1>
In times like this, it takes a lot of courage to dream and realize
that dream.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#118:1>
It is 7:30 am, 20 Nov ' 91 today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#119:1>
I started writing this letter on the day you called, ie 10 Nov ' 91.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#120:1>
Looks like I'm writing a diary.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#121:1>
Well better end here before it becomes an autobiography!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#122:1>
Hope you enjoy reading my nonsense.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#123:1>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#124:1>
Pal-in-Christ.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#125:1>
Mary </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#126:2>
Dear Shanrui,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#127:2>
It was really sweet of you to write to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#128:2>
I didn't expect you to keep in touch with me, but you did and you've
written two letters already and this is only my first.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#129:2>
Please pardon me for procrastinating.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#130:2>
Believe me, I had wanted to reply to your letters much earlier than
now but I just didn't get down to it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#131:2>
I know how lonely and homesick one can be when one is away from home
but still I've shelved writing until now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#132:2>
I'm mortified by this.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#133:2>
I'll try to be more disciplined and faithful to write to you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#134:2>
What you wrote about Canada came as a surprise to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#135:2>
My impression ( not first-hand) is, I think, somewhat similar to
yours before you flew there and saw with your own eyes, for the first time,
what it's like.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#136:2>
I guess it's time for me to see the place too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#137:2>
My husband has a sister in the States and she's been asking us to
visit her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#138:2>
We hope to be able to do so in not too distant a future.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#139:2>
Maybe then we can also pay you a visit at Toronto, if the trip falls
within the period you're there!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#140:2>
Talking about trips, I've been offered to attend the first workshop
on ICE stands for International Corpus of English and it's the project for
which I'm employed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#141:2>
About 22 countries are involved in this project which aims to create
a vast database of each of the national corpora of the English Language
spoken and written in the member countries.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#142:2>
But I don't know how many of these countries will be represented at
the work shop.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#143:2>
We have to obtain our own funds, you see.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#144:2>
And it is beginning to be quite apparent that the funds needed to
sponsor me for this trip will not be coming in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#145:2>
I've been told by one of the professors in this project team to be
prepared to be disappointed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#146:2>
And I think I probably will.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#147:2>
He has done what he could but if the university does not want to
support if by way of funds, then there's no way I can be on the plane to the
Netherlands.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#148:2>
The team is still waiting for a final reply from the administration
of this university but I'm not optimistic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#149:2>
I was initially very excited about the trip but frankly, the
excitement has worn out now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#150:2>
I will be disappointed in that all probability be negative, but I
will not feel disappointed as my initial eagerness to go has diminished to a
zilch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#151:2>
It may not be worthwhile to go if the trip is offered with
obligation, ie, you have to be bonded and work for them for a few years after
the trip because they sponsor you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#152:2>
And this thing about bond must not be taken lightly but be
approached with caution and careful consideration.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#153:2>
Anyway, nothing is finalised yet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#154:2>
I'll have to wait and see will keep you updated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#155:2>
I have something else to tell you but I'll reserve it for the next
letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#156:2>
Not that I fear a dearth of materials to write to you the next time
but I'm afraid if I don't despatch this letter soon enough, you're going to
receive it probably a few weeks, if not months, later than originally
intended.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#157:2>
So bye dor now ....

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#158:2>
er, I suppose I have to at least answer your 1 million dollar
question you posed twice, in this letter, eh? <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X159:2>
Well, baby Lee is not in sight yet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X160:2>
'Will let you know definitely.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X161:2>
TAKE CARE!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X162:2>
Brenda Lee-Koh

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X163:2>
17 Feb 1992 - oops!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-001#X164:2>
A thousand apologies again for being this late! </X> </I>
