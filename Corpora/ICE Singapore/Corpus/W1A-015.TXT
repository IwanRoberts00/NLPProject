<h> Section II </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#3:1>
Between late 14th century and mid 18th century, China's
population increased five to six fold from 45-60 million to about 400
million. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#4:1>
Yet, agricultural production increased six
fold within the period. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#5:1>
While there were significant
changes in the population, the organization of agriculture and the level of
technology remained unchanged. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#6:1>
How was it then, one
might ask, that the rural households were able to maintain their living
standards up to the mid 18th century despite the rising population pressure
and the severe competition for limited resources resulting from it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#7:1>
One of the adjustment the rural households undertook
was to increase their agricultural productivity per unit lf land which help
to increase total production. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#8:1>
There were " rising
yields within a stagnant technology". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#9:1>
Agricultural
productivity was increased within the threshold of traditional technology.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#10:1>
There were two types of innovations one can divide
under the traditional technology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#11:1>
One is organic
innovation and the other inorganic innovation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#12:1>
The
former involves labour-intensive techniques like double0cropping, improved
seeds, new crops, irrigation and drainage which help to increase yields per
acre and also help to absorb the growing population. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#13:1>
Inorganic innovation involves capital investment in farm implements.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#14:1>
New improved seeds were used by the peasants as a
means to increase their agricultural production. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#15:1>
The
new improved seeds were often of a high yielding kind, drought resistant,
fertilizer responsive and disease resistant. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#16:1>
Being
drought resistant, the farmers are ensured that at least there would be some
yields available during droughts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#17:1>
New crops like corn
and sweet potatoes were also introduced to the rural households.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#18:1>
Corn can be grown on mountainous regions while sweet
potatoes are able to grow on dry lands. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#19:1>
Hence by using
these two new crops the farmers were able to extend the arable land for
cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#20:1>
Besides the two new crops were often of
higher yields than the rest of the crops. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#21:1>
For example,
corn had 5-15% higher yields than kaoliang and millet.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#22:1>
Fertilizers either 'natural' or compound were also
used to add to the fertility of the soil which helps to increase yields per
acre. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#23:1>
The collection of fertilizers was also labour
intensive and hence helped to absorb the rural population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#24:1>
There was also an increase use of irrigation, drainage
and water control system in the peasants effort to increase agricultural
productivity. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#25:1>
Irrigation and drainage to previously
uncultivable dry lands was able to increase the total acreage of land brought
under cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#26:1>
Besides irrigation, drainage and
water control also enabled the farmers to switch to cultivation of wet rice
which constitutes the staple food of the population and often yielded higher
values. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#27:1>
The Chinese peasants also migrated to
previously uncultivated land in North China, North West China instead of just
mainly concentrating at the lower Yangtze plain. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#28:1>
This
move enabled the increase in the total area of land brought under
cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#29:1>
However by the mid 18th century, the
rural households could not just rely on increasing agricultural productivity
to cope with the rising population pressure and severe competition for
limited resources. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#30:1>
There was already a maximum labour-land input by the mid 18th century
where the number of cultivable land was running out. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#31:1>
The peasants in their rational economic
behaviour in optimizing their chances for survival were increasing resorting
to sidelines like raising pigs, peddler to supplement their farm income.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#32:1>
An increasing number of peasants also migrated to the
cities to work as transport coolie or part-time labourers to supplement their
farm income. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#33:1>
By the end of 18th century, there was
also all increase cases of overseas migration by the peasants to Australia,
Southeast Asia and America to work as coolies. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#34:1>
It was
estimated that by late 18th century, 2m people had migrated overseas to seek
jobs which not only helped to relieve the population pressure at home but
also contributed money in the form of remittance sent back home.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#35:1>
The rural households also increasingly turned to their
lineage and clans who helped in the organization of farm work and gave
protection to the rural households from intruders during the difficult time.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#36:1>
The rural households also brought their handicraft
industry to the rural areas to supplement their farm income where 25-30% of
the farm income was meant for the market. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#37:1>
Hence by
increasing agricultural productivity within the limits of traditional
technology using the labour intensive methods, ruralising the handicraft
industry, migration and increasing dependence on the lineage and clans, the
rural households were able to cope with the rising population pressure and
severe competition for limited resources. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#38:1>
This was
reflected by their living standards which was maintained without a drastic
fall. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#39:1>
However the institutional flexibility of the
peasants had severe implications. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#40:1>
As the technological
school of interpretation pointed out while China was able to increase
agricultural productivity with the limits of traditional technology, she had
fallen into a vicious trap of overpopulation set by herself.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#41:1>
This trap meant that China had shifted away from
labour saving industrializing efforts to labour intensive methods in order to
absorb her growing population growth. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#42:1>
Such
institutional flexibility only sought to aggravate the situation as the
economic institutions would use labour-intensive methods in order to absorb
the population which in turn tend to encourage further population growth as
such techniques require manpower. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#43:1>
Hence, in the
short-run while the institutional flexibility was able to alleviate short-
term sufferings of rising population pressure in the long run it would result
in the prolonging of economic stagnation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#44:1>
Besides, by
using the traditional methods of technology, while agricultural production
would increase, it would reach a maximum point and then China would lapse
into a high-level equilibrium trap beyond which diminishing returns would set
in. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#45:1>
According to Mark Elvin the high level equilibrium
was already reached by 1800. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#46:1>
hence unless there was a
technological breakthrough, diminishing returns would set in.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#47:1>
While the traditional technology was able to effect
quantitative changes, there was no qualitative changes in the form of
increase per capita income for the rural peasants. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#48:1>
According to the technological school of thought, the rural households were
not unimaginative or conservative as they were receptive to new changes like
the new crops of corn and sweet potatoes and had actually invented water-
driven machines during Sung China which was found only in 18th century
England but rather because of their technological preference.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#49:1>
Their technological preference for labour intensive
techniques was in view of the rising population pressure, they were pragmatic
in that they were suppose to absorb the growing labour force rather than to
create redundant labour. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#50:1>
Hence this explained their
strong disincentive for labour saving machines. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#51:1>
Hence
while the rural households were able to cope with rising population pressure
using the traditional methods of technology, their institutional flexibility
had only prolong the economic stagnation of the country and hamper
industrializing efforts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#52:1>
But on the other hand, it had
provided a stable model for China. </I>

<I> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#53:2>
Q8 <h> Section III </h> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#54:2>
The
Chinese proletariat of the Republican period could be viewed as the product
of modern industrialization efforts in China. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#55:2>
The
Chinese working class while rising rapidly from 1 1/2m in 1919 ro 3m in the
1920s constituted to less than 1% of Chinese total population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#56:2>
The working class were often made up of young female
and male workers who had migrated from the rural areas to the cities to look
for jobs. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#57:2>
Most of the workers viewed their jobs as
transitory and had no identification with their jobs or class as traditional
ties with the family remained significantly strong. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#58:2>
The Chinese workers however were often exploited especially under the
contract system. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#59:2>
The Chinese workers had to work very
long hours of about 14-16 hours with very low wages, which was only half
compared to their Japanese counterparts under very poorly ventilated
conditions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#60:2>
Health and medical care was almost nil and
the workers were often suffering from tuberculosis or other work hazards.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#61:2>
This to a certain extent led to the development of
conscious awareness of the exploitation and oppressed giveing rise to a
distinctive working class consciousness. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#62:2>
However most
of the peasants were illiterate and found it difficult to conceive their
misery in terms of class. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#63:2>
In most cases, their hatred
was directed towards their most immediate exploitators like the contract
foreman. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#64:2>
Besides as Emily Honig pointed out in her
study of Shanghai Cotton Mills, the female workers often join Sisterhood
Associations which was native based rather than Labour Unions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#65:2>
The female workers had very weak class consciousness
and had strong ties with their native places. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#66:2>
The
guilds which dominated the working scene were often occupational based rather
than class. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#67:2>
All these prevented greater class
solidarity among the worker class. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#68:2>
This was made worse
perhaps by the increasing number of female workers in the factories which was
difficult to be mobilized and often did not interact with others except those
from their native places. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#69:2>
The female workers accounted
for 76% of the total workers in the Shanghai Cotton Mill.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#70:2>
The militant labour movement in the 1920s was not an
isolated movement but had merged with the multi-class nationalistic upsurge
of anti-warlordism and anti-imperialism which aimed to change the
international and domestic status quo. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#71:2>
The
revolutionary nationalism was embodied in the first United Front since 1924.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#72:2>
The rise of the working class could be attributed to
the guidance and organization provided by the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP)
and the protection given by the Kuomingtan ( KMT) 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#73:2>
Since the main arena of the multi-nationalistic upsurge was located mainly in
the industrial cities, the working class due to its concentration in the main
industrial centres and their potential for mobilization hence played a
pivotal role. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#74:2>
Besides their strategic location in the
main theatre of political struggle, the working class was also concentrated
in 6 enclaves mainly found in big cities like Hong Kong, Canton, Shanghai.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#75:2>
Their geographical location allow easy mobilization to
serve as a striking political force. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#76:2>
The working class
with their economic grievances especially with the re-entry of foreign
competitors and growing inflation could be stated in nationalistic terms and
evoke widespread sympathy from the various circles in the era where
nationalistic sentiments were widespread. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#77:2>
Hence given
the favourable external circumstances of anti-imperialism and
anti-warlordism and the protection and guidance by the KMT and CCP, the
working class was able to play a significant role in China's politics.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#78:2>
This was despite its weakness as a semi-proletariat
working class, weak class consciousness, small in number and young.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#79:2>
However besides being involved in the nationalistic
upsurge movement the militant working class was also deeply entangled in the
political struggle within the United Front. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#80:2>
There was
this fear by the intellectuals, moderates, capitalists and conservatives
within the UF that the working class which was instigated and dominated by
the CCP would escalate from a National labour movement to a social
Revolution. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#81:2>
Chiang Kai-Shek shared the aspirations of
the fear and was determined to purge the CCP from the UF and suppressed the
labour movement which was the base for CCP to capture power from within the
UF. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#82:2>
Hence the militant working class was suppressed in
the white Terror of 1927 because it was the chief instrument from which the
CCP sought to capture power. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#83:2>
With the establishment of
the Nanking government, Chiang Kai-Shek took strenuous efforts to
depoliticize the labour movement. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#84:2>
The labour unions
were disbanded or the leaders replaced by government-appointed officials.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#85:2>
By the time, Chiang Kai-Shek tightened his control
over the country, the labour Unions that existed was what was known as "
Yellow Union" in which the labour unions was not to represent the workers'
rights but served to supervise and organize workers in their production.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#86:2>
The 1929 labour union law also prohibited the
formation of any labour union or other associated activities without
government's approval. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#87:2>
Hence under the tight control
of Chiang Kai-Shek the unions that remained were either reorganized KMT
bodies or bodies that were formed under the shadow of the employers.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#88:2>
Besides by the 1930s, the favourable external
conditions of anti-warlordism and anti-imperialism movement that had pushed
the working class into the forefront of history as a significant political
force had subsided with Chiang Kai-Shek unifying the whole of China under his
authoritative rule. <X> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#X89:2>
Besides Chiang also looked
into the material well-being of the working class and sought to improve it
bit by bit like better wages and working hours and hence depriving and
eliminating the economic grievances of the working class.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#X90:2>
By 1930s, the communists were completely pushed out
of the cities and hence the working class were deprived of an external
supporter to guide and organize. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-015#X91:2>
The working class
was able to become a significant political force in the 1920s was mainly due
to the favourable external forces The working class remained young, too
differentiated from their agrarian heritage to be able to play an articulate,
self-conscious class alone without the support of the outside forces. </X>
