<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#2:1>
<h> Improvements in the Subordinate Courts </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#3:1>
<h> Wider power will result in 2,000 more civil cases a year heard
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#4:1>
AN ADDITIONAL 2,000 civil cases a year will be heard in the
Subordinate Courts as a result of legislation passed last week to widen its
jurisdiction.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#5:1>
This was disclosed in the 1993 Workplan for the Subordinate Courts,
the second of an annual goal-setting exercise which was introduced last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#6:1>
A copy of the report was made available to The Sunday Times.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#7:1>
About 200 staff from the courts attended a two-hour closed-door
seminar on the Workplan held yesterday at the Subordinate Courts building in
Upper Cross Street.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#8:1>
The Subordinate Courts ( Amendment) Bill passed by Parliament last
Tuesday increases the monetary limit and widens the nature of cases that can
be heard in the district and magistrate courts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#9:1>
Would the Subordinate Courts be able to cope with the heavier
workload?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#10:1>
In an interview with The Sunday Times and Lianhe Zaobao, Mr Daniel
Koh, Registrar of the Subordinate Courts maintained that it would.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#11:1>
" Even before this Bill was passed, we were already thinking of new
ways to improve our efficiency further.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#12:1>
We have came up with a few steps to do that.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#13:1>
These will help us cope."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#14:1>
<h> Some of the steps include: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#15:1>
<h> Decentralising court management: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#16:1>
Instead of having a central court calendar, groups of judicial
officers will be assigned a number of cases and given the flexibility to deal
with them within a given period.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#17:1>


<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#18:1>
<h> * Maximising the use of court time: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#19:1>
To prevent disruptions caused by last-minute withdrawal of cases a
list of cases in which parties are prepared to appear in court with 24 hours
notice will be compiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#20:1>
These can then be brought before the court whenever there are
last-minute withdrawals.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#21:1>
<h> * Better planning of cases: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#22:1>
Some cases are more likely to result in guilty pleas.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#23:1>
Identifying them would help the court estimate how much time to
allocate for these hearings, thereby freeing court time for other cases.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#24:1>
<h> * Encouraging the use of composition fines: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#25:1>
A six month publicity blitz will be held later this year, jointly
with the Traffic Police, Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing Board
to encourage the public to pay their fines.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#26:1>
This will cut down the number of cases coming to trial for
non-payment of fines.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#27:1>
Up to four months' wait at most for hearings Reports by Warren
Fernandez CASES in the Subordinate Courts will now be heard in four months or
less because of steps taken since July last year to reduce the waiting time
for a case to come to trial.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#28:1>
Those on trial for civil and criminal offences can now expect their
cases to be heard in two to four months instead of the previous waiting
period of between one and two years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#29:1>
Consumers filing claims in the Small Claims Tribunal are also likely
to have their cases heard within 10 to 12 days compared to the six-month wait
before the middle of last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#30:1>
Traffic offences will be dealt with within three weeks, instead of
six to nine months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#31:1>
These improvements are published in the Subordinate Courts first
annual report for last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#32:1>
The report, the first produced by the Judiciary was billed by the
Chief Justice as an annual report card on the performance of the Subordinate
Courts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#33:1>
It was released after the courts introduced their first annual
Workplan last July which stressed the need to cut waiting times for trials.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#34:1>
In an interview with the Sunday Times and Lianhe Zaobao on Thursday,
the subordinate Courts registrar, Mr Daniel Koh, said the annual report would
make judicial officers more accountable to the public."This is our report
card.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#35:1>
" Anyone can see what the normal waiting times for a case are.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#36:1>
This puts pressure on us to perform." He noted that the courts had
increased significantly the number of cases it heard last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#37:1>
For example, more than 35,600 claims were settled in the Small Claims
Tribunal last year, a 70 per cent jump over l991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#38:1>
The number of civil cases dealt with in the court was also up 20 per
cent to 1832 cases last year while 10,349 criminal cases were heard, a 14 per
cent increase over l991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#39:1>
The result: Almost all of the backlog of cases which built up between
l983 and 1991 had been dealt with.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#40:1>
The remaining few would be heard by June.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#41:1>
Some of the steps taken to speed up the administration of justice
included holding pre-trial conferences to ensure that the parties were
properly prepared before their cases came up and introducing more night court
sessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#42:1>
The system of charging hearing fees for civil cases going to trial,
introduced last July, also meant that parties had to make a more realistic
assessment of their cases before seeking more of the courts limited hearing
time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#43:1>
As a result the number of civil cases coming up for hearing fell by
15 per cent since the system was introduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#44:1>
Asked about complaints from some lawyers that the changes had meant a
back-breaking pace of work, he said: These are just birth pangs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#45:1>
We are going through a major change in work practices and culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#46:1>
After a while, we will all get used to it, and be the better for it."

<h> PM to S'poreans: Lift your sights and focus on national interests
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#48:2>
<h> Staying ahead economically as a nation more important than
communal matters </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#49:2>
By Warren Fernandez

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#50:2>
Straits Times June 6, 1993

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#51:2>
SINGAPOREANS must focus on the challenges facing the country, such as
how to stay ahead of the economic competition, and not be preoccupied with
community issues, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said last night.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#52:2>
He said that while each ethnic community had its own problems which
needed attention, these could only be addressed after overriding national
interests had been met.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#53:2>
Speaking at a dinner to mark the 60th anniversary of Jamiyah, the
Muslim Missionary Society of Singapore, he urged the Malay community to focus
more on national issues and to see Malay issues from a national perspective..

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#54:2>
This applied to the Chinese-speaking community as well, he added,
saying that unless the various communities here lifted their sights, and saw
the woods and not just the trees, Singapore would lose its bearings.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#55:2>
The basic, perennial issue facing the country was how to stay ahead
of the economic competition, he said, reiterating a theme that has dominated
his recent speeches.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#56:2>
" Malay Singaporeans, like other Singaporeans, will have to worry
about basic issues, like making a living, and how to sustain progress in the
light of challenging regional and global developments.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#57:2>
" These issues will affect the well-being of your community.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#58:2>
Your community's problems cannot be resolved in isolation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#59:2>
They can only be resolved in the context of the nation, and after
overriding national interests have been resolved," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#60:2>
Mr Goh began his 20-minute speech to about 1,000 guests at the
dinner, held at the Orchard Hotel, by commending Jamiyah for its non-communal
approach to community issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#61:2>
This enabled Malays and non-Malays to support its welfare and
educational programmes, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#62:2>
To gauge the current concerns of the Malay community, he said that he
had asked the Information and the Arts Ministry to go through issues of
Berita Harian, the Malay daily, over the last two months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#63:2>
The survey revealed that the topics most on Malay minds were: the
attendance of Malay students in the madrasah or Islamic schools, Malay youths
in teenage gangs, Malay participation in investments, the sale of non-halal
meat and the use of English in Malay homes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#64:2>
While these issues needed to be addressed as they were important to
the development of the community, they were not the most serious issues
facing the Malay community in the future, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#65:2>
The same might be said of, the Chinese-speaking community, he
continued, recounting how he was struck by the similarities in the tenor and
tone of two separate dialogues for Malay- and Chinese-speaking Singaporeans,
held by the Feedback Unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#66:2>
National issues were hardly discussed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#67:2>
Instead, participants had spent an undue amount of time on evergreen
issues such as the status and use of the Malay language, and the status,
standards, teaching, learning and use of the Chinese language.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#68:2>
Unless Singaporeans tackled the bigger issue of how to raise their
standard of living further, he said, they would not be creating the wealth
needed to solve the problems of each community.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#69:2>
Giving examples of the intense economic competition ahead, he noted
that Penang had attracted high-tech investments, while Labuan was being built
up as a tax haven and a financial centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#70:2>
Indonesia was building bigger ports in Batam and West Java, which
could result in less of its cargo passing through Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#71:2>
And Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok both aimed to be the aviation hubs of
the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#72:2>
Warning that Singapore risked becoming a 'has-been' if it did not
stay ahead of the competition, he said: " If our services are not better than
others, what else can we do?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#73:2>
This question will have to be answered by all Singaporeans,
regardless of the specific issues which engross the different communities."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#74:2>
Mr Goh, who was welcomed on his arrival by a Malay kompang band, was
later presented with a kris by Jamiyah.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#75:2>
Several guests interviewed last night agreed with the Prime
Minister's message.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#76:2>
Administrative manager Khalid Hassan, 37, said: " Most Malays would
agree that we need to focus on the bigger picture, as Singapore is facing a
lot of competition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#77:2>
" But with more immediate day-to-day concerns, they may need to be
reminded."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#78:2>
Said Mr Umar Abdul Hamid, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC: " I think the
Malay community is mature enough to look beyond its present concerns and
contribute to the national debate on how to secure the future." Another BT
journalist charged with breaching Official Secrets Act By Warren Fernandez
ANOTHER Business Times ( BT) journalist was charged in court yesterday with
breaching the Official Secrets Act, just three days before a joint trial of
four other men for a related offence was to begin on Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#79:2>
Technology editor Kenneth James, 45, was charged with receiving and
passing on information relating to the official flash estimates of
Singapore's economic growth in the second quarter of last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#80:2>
James, an economics correspondent with the newspaper at the time of
the alleged offence, pleaded not guilty and was released on a
&dollar;5,000 bail.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#81:2>
At a separate hearing later yesterday, Senior District Judge Richard
Magnus ruled that in the light of this development, the two-week trial
scheduled to begin on Monday would be adjourned.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#82:2>
Deputy Public Prosecutor Errol Foenander yesterday declined to say
why the new charges were brought against James at this late stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#83:2>
" Of course, I cannot reveal the reasons, " he told reporters after
the pre-trial hearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#84:2>
James was one of several BT staffers interviewed by the Internal
Security Department soon after seven ISD officers searched BT's offices last
August.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#85:2>
The two charges against him relate to a BT report published on June
29 last year, a few days before the flash estimates - - quick, initial
calculations - - of Singapore's growth had been released officially.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#86:2>
Four men were charged last December on nine counts of breaching the
OSA in connection with the BT report.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#87:2>
They are Tharman Shanmugaratnam, 35, director of the Monetary
Authority of Singapore's economics department, Manu Bhaskaran, 34, Crosby
Securities' economic research director; Raymond Foo Jong Chen, 28, a Crosby
regional economist; and Business Times editor Patrick Daniel, 38.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#88:2>
All four were in court yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#89:2>
If found guilty, they each face a maximum sentence of a
&dollar;2,000 fine or two years' jail, or both.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#90:2>
Yesterday, Mr Foenander applied to have James tried jointly with the
other four accused men.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#91:2>
He said the prosecution was prepared to go ahead with the trial next
week, if the defence agreed to a joint trial.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#92:2>
Counsel for James, Mr Harry Elias, however, pointed out that his
client had been arrested on Thursday night and charged yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#93:2>
He therefore needed more time to decide whether to agree to a joint
trial and to prepare his client's defence. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X94:2>
" There is so much to do in so little time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X95:2>
In fairness to my client and myself, it would be difficult to begin
on Monday," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X96:2>
Mr Foenander replied that he was not seeking an adjournment, but if
the defence sought to have the hearing postponed, he would not object to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X97:2>
Counsel for Shanmugaratnam, Manu and Daniel, however, argued that as
the prosecution had not asked for an adjournment, the court should proceed
with the hearing on Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X98:2>
Urging the judge not to postpone the trial, counsel for Bhaskaran,
Mr Michael Khoo, said: " These are serious charges that have hung over my
client for the last few months, and we want the trial to go ahead as soon as
possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X99:2>
" There can be no reason to delay the trial just because the
prosecution has, at the eleventh hour, added additional charges." Agreeing,
Mr K.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X100:2>
Shanmugam, counsel for Daniel, added that since the prosecution was
not making an application for an adjournment, the court could go ahead with
the trial, and consider if James should be tried with the rest some time next
week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X101:2>
" If the arguments for a joint trial are thrown out, then we would
not have wasted two weeks," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X102:2>
A further complication arose when Mr Tan Kok Quan, counsel for Foo,
applied to be discharged from representing his client, saying recent
developments had put him in " a conflict situation".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X103:2>
Foo agreed to discharge his counsel, adding that he expected to
appoint a new lawyer by later yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X104:2>
The new lawyer, he said, was prepared to go ahead with the case
next Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X105:2>
To resolve these matters the judge asked Mr Elias, counsel for
James, how long he would need to prepare his arguments on whether his client
should be tried jointly with the others.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X106:2>
The lawyer said while he would like to have two weeks he could do
so by tomorrow adding " if need be, we will burn the midnight oil".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X107:2>
But he said he could not be expected to prepare his client's
defence by Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X108:2>
Furthermore, he would be tied up with another case in the High
Court for 10 days from June 28.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-003#X109:2>
The judge then decided to adjourn the case and schedule a pre-trial
conference for next Friday to settle the issue of whether the five men should
be tried jointly and fix new dates for the hearing. </X> </I>
