<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#29:1:B>
I don't know how she's going to transcribe that man

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#30:1:A>
He called me earlier today wanting to see me because Soh Soon
has directed him uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#31:1:A>
So Poh Soon was telling me only library uh only mission

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#32:1:A>
So he said library and other areas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#33:1:A>
So I congratulated him lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#34:1:B>
But did uh your your is Mary going to nominated for library
again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#35:1:A>
If not her who who can stand in her in her position

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#36:1:B>
This coming next next on twenty-third is nominations <unclear>
word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#37:1:A>
But that would be up to the Senior Pastor to propose uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#38:1:B>
Ya he will propose lah but nominations could <unclear> word
</unclear> agree or disagree with him

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#39:1:A>
But if able to disagree then I would assume that <unclear>
word </unclear> alternative

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#40:1:A>
Bigger

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#41:1:B>
No lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#42:1:B>
My you you you are the better person to tell him what who who has
been working in the library committee

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#43:1:A>
If you uh talk about experience I don't think you can get
anyone <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#44:1:A>
So there're other people within the church uh that are that are
qualified to do this job

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#45:1:B>
But you have old old old timers Mrs Basti

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#46:1:A>
Old timers probably they have own problem uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#47:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#51:1:A>
I'm not sure whether he can do it or not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#52:1:B>
He used to right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#53:1:A>
It's more than just sitting and directing people to do when
you classify your books

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#54:1:A>
It's quite a professional job and Mary is professionally trained to
do that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#55:1:B>
We used to have one girl

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#56:1:B>
Remember her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#57:1:B>
She was trained in library work in UK you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#58:1:A>
I heard about that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#59:1:B>
And then she she got married to a church member from another
church

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#60:1:B>
Alamak we lost one potential librarian there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#61:1:A>
Marriage uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#62:1:B>
Uh you taping this uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#63:1:A>
It's already on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#64:1:A>
So how's your flat

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#65:1:B>
I don't know man

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#66:1:B>
I just received a letter from uh HDB

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#67:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#68:1:B>
They're saying the the it's it's been approved lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#69:1:B>
The sale has been approved

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#70:1:A>
The sale of your flat or the one which you you're going to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#71:1:B>
The sale of my flat has been approved

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#72:1:B>
And uh this this uh just think I I need another month's time I can
get a

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#73:1:B>
We should get a letter to go and sign on the legal documents uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#74:1:B>
But my problem now is this old man who bought over my house

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#75:1:B>
He wants to come in and start planning the renovation while I'm
still there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#76:1:A>
Old man uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#77:1:A>
Days are numbered

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#78:1:B>
That might be create quite a problem uh because of my house
now a lot of junk

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#79:1:A>
Uhm did

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#80:1:B>
We've got boxes lying around then my antiques

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#81:1:A>
Why don't you just show him the plan

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#82:1:B>
I don't have a plan my friend

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#83:1:B>
You know the plan uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#84:1:B>
You want to get a copy of the plan you got to pay you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#85:1:A>
You ask him

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#86:1:A>
See how much

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#87:1:A>
Five five dollars per copy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#88:1:B>
Ever since I moved in ever since I ever since I moved in I
never paid I never bought the plan

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#89:1:B>
But in this new house that I bought the owner bought a plan and
gave me a copy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#90:1:A>
But I thought when I got my flat they gave me free

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#91:1:B>
Ha

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#92:1:A>
I I didn't pay for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#93:1:A>
I didn't buy a plan

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#94:1:A>
They just gave me a a plan of my flat

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#95:1:B>
Are you sure

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#96:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#97:1:B>
Nowadays you got to buy you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#98:1:A>
Really uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#99:1:B>
How old is your flat

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#100:1:A>
About six years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#101:1:B>
Ah about the same time same as mine what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#102:1:A>
Six years exactly uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#103:1:A>
But mine all included with the sales agreement

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#104:1:A>
I don't think my wife paid for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#105:1:A>
I didn't pay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#106:1:B>
Maybe it's all in all added up into the sum you pay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#107:1:B>
You don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#108:1:A>
Maybe lah maybe

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#109:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#110:1:A>
You can ask him to buy lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#111:1:A>
You pay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#112:1:A>
How much can it cost

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#113:1:B>
Not much lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#114:1:A>
Search fee maybe two dollars about ten dollars uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#115:1:B>
Not much lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#116:1:B>
But but it's a way of making money what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#117:1:A>
Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#118:1:A>
Just I just came back from HDB

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#119:1:C>
Pastor Wee

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#120:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#121:1:C>
Uh just <unclear> word </unclear> can you come to the phone
for a while

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#122:1:B>
Uh just a minute uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#123:1:B>
Is it urgent or not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#124:1:C>
Urgent yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#125:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#126:1:B>
Were you around at the Peter Lewis seminar

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#127:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#128:1:A>
I was yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#129:1:A>
I missed service Sunday service uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#130:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#131:1:A>
How was the seminar

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#132:1:B>
I I think for the night meetings uh about two hundred plus

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#133:1:A>
Two hundred plus uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#134:1:B>
Two hundred twenty thirty

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#135:1:B>
I expected more uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#136:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#137:1:B>
But

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#138:1:A>
Were these people church members or outside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#139:1:B>
Most of them were church members

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#140:1:B>
But I I I I'm beginning to see uhm maybe we we need to we need to
we need to strategize the publicity

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#141:1:B>
Remember two two two years ago your missions conference was goyak

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#142:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#143:1:A>
Mission conference was okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#144:1:B>
Two years ago

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#145:1:B>
Remember when uh Terence was organising it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#146:1:A>
Oh when I was still a student

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#147:1:B>
Attendance

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#148:1:A>
Put the record straight

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#149:1:A>
I was a student not working yet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#150:1:B>
The attendance was terrible

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#151:1:B>
Remember only about a few people turned up

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#152:1:B>
And that unless unless you push hard uh people will not come

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#153:1:B>
Uh uh we were just talking about it last night with uh Danny and
uh my wife and Philip

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#154:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#155:1:B>
It's it's information overkill

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#156:1:B>
They look up the bulletin on Sunday

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#157:1:A>
There're too many

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#158:1:B>
Too many things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#159:1:A>
Too many

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#160:1:B>
It's information overload

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#161:1:B>
The system breakdown

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#162:1:B>
They don't know how to prioritize

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#163:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#164:1:B>
Which one to attend which one not to attend

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#165:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#166:1:B>
So in the end they glaze over everything and nothing seems in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#167:1:A>
That's probably just one one factor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#168:1:A>
I think the other point you need to see is the period in which you
began your publicity

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#169:1:B>
Long time ago you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#170:1:A>
Long time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#171:1:A>
When when when was long time ago

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#172:1:B>
I wrote a letter to all the the Small Group Leaders you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#173:1:B>
About one and a half months ago

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#174:1:A>
But you you didn't have prayer meeting calling the Small
Group Leaders to pray

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#175:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#176:1:A>
Which we did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#177:1:A>
Our mission conference preparation took about a year

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#178:1:A>
It's just the preparation and then we have our quarterly uh
mission prayer night

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#179:1:A>
And we made it a point to emphasize to point out this mission
conference

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#180:1:B>
I suppose the other the other thing is how you sell how you
sell the publicity

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#181:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#182:1:B>
Put the topic like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#183:1:B>
You'll deter a lot of people from coming

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#184:1:A>
Ya ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#185:1:B>
Only those who are really interested come

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#186:1:A>
The the the topic itself tells you what is expected uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#187:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#188:1:A>
Spiritual movement

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#189:1:A>
Not everybody wants <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#190:1:B>
Not everybody wants discipleship too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#191:1:B>
It's it scares people away the topic

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#192:1:A>
Ya discipleship <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#193:1:B>
You can <unclear> word </unclear> with missions what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#194:1:B>
When you organize a missions conference people interested in
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#195:1:B>
Those not interested won't come

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#196:1:B>
So in the but I I think on the whole those who came really
benefited

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#197:1:A>
They were Small Group Leaders

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#198:1:B>
Most of them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#199:1:B>
But I there were a lot more Small Group Leaders who didn't turn up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#200:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#201:1:B>
Somehow they <unclear> word </unclear> that's good

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#202:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#203:1:B>
Well I I think uh uh he's a good fellow to fall back for
something <unclear> word </unclear> conference uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#204:1:B>
Talking about a Bible conference Sunday School <unclear> word
</unclear> seminar or something of that sort

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#205:1:B>
'Cos his exposition is quite good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#206:1:B>
That's supposed to be his specialty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#207:1:A>
What's his background

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#208:1:B>
Baptist

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#209:1:A>
Evangelical Baptist

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#210:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#211:1:B>
But he preached at uh he was a good friend of Martin Lloyd Jones

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#212:1:A>
Really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#213:1:B>
Martin Lloyd Jones got him to preach <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#214:1:A>
So did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#215:1:A>
Oh really so uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#216:1:B>
So his style of preaching is Martin Lloyd Jones'

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#217:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#218:1:B>
You read Martin Lloyd Jones books and listen to his tapes and
uh the style is about the same

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#219:1:B>
But I when I was sitting down talking to him I I think right now
he might be coming back here quite often because he's made contacts with uh
Church of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#220:1:B>
He's made contacts with uh Anglican church

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#221:1:A>
Oh is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#222:1:B>
And I think his own church in UK is finally releasing him

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#223:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#224:1:B>
To go on this kind of tours

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#225:1:B>
So if you want to you can call him again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#226:1:A>
Maybe family camp will be good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#227:1:A>
If they talk about Wesley Wesley camp pointing or focused on
activities

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#228:1:A>
This time perhaps focus on Bible study <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#229:1:B>
If we have if we have a Bible conference <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#230:1:B>
But uh I think next year will be a different conference inviting
somebody else

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#231:1:B>
Whole flavour will change

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#232:1:A>
Maybe we just have too many conferences

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#233:1:B>
That's

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#234:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#235:1:B>
That's another possibility lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#236:1:B>
We have we have too many programs in town

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#237:1:A>
Uh uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#238:1:B>
People have to choose

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#239:1:B>
So it's overload overkill

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#240:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#285:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#286:1:A>
Snow uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#287:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#288:1:A>
I guess minus uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#289:1:A>
I wrote to them asked them for temperature range

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#290:1:A>
They said will be cool

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#291:1:B>
For them cool is different from this cool you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#292:1:A>
Cool

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#293:1:A>
That's relative you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#294:1:B>
Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#295:1:B>
Their cool is not like uh Sanyo air-con cool

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#296:1:B>
Their cool is more like deep-freeze cool

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#297:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#298:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#299:1:B>
But Michigan is near the lakes right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#300:1:B>
The Great Lakes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#301:1:A>
Ya <unclear> word </unclear> my seminary is just near the
lake

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#302:1:B>
Frozen in winter

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#303:1:B>
Ya it'll be cold

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#304:1:A>
That's where scholars are made you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#305:1:B>
Bring your chilli padi lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#308:1:A>
Sambal balachan

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#309:1:B>
Is uh is Pauline going to cook for you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#310:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#311:1:A>
I think that's the cheapest uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#312:1:A>
Don't touch the food that an American has touched

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#313:1:A>
Do your own thing lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#314:1:A>
Just buy the raw material from the farmers' market

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#315:1:A>
If you go to supermarket also it'll be very expensive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#316:1:B>
Ya when I took Peter and Valerie out yesterday afternoon for
lunch they said that's very very something they seldom do over there <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X317:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X318:1:B>
Because for them to to eat out it's <unclear> word
</unclear> ten times more than cooking at home

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X319:1:B>
So for them after church uh it's usually

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X320:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X321:1:B>
Lunch means we take you home for lunch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X322:1:B>
Here lunch we take you out for lunch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X323:1:B>
But if you are to uh to to eat out over there I mean if you buy
and cook in then uh uh from what I heard from uh Gujang who goes there quite
often it's cheap

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X324:1:A>
Uh cheaper lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X325:1:A>
Cook your own food lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X326:1:A>
We have kitchenette

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X327:1:A>
I was told that we're going to stay in at one of the cottages

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X328:1:A>
The school has no dormitory

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X329:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X330:1:A>
But they have several cottages

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X331:1:A>
So we have to take care of the garden

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X332:1:A>
In winter we're supposed to shove the snow

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X333:1:A>
Uh in spring we got to cut the grass and like that that lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X334:1:B>
And then you get paid for that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X335:1:A>
No lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X336:1:A>
That's part of our roster duty man

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X337:1:B>
You you're staying in a community hostel uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X338:1:A>
It's a it's a it's like it's a seminary and they've their
own cottages where students reside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X339:1:B>
Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X340:1:B>
Cottage condo like that lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-040#X341:1:A>
Something like that lah </X> </I>
