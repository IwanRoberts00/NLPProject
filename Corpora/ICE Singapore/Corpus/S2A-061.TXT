<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#1:1:A>
May it please you my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#2:1:A>
As far as possible my Lords I'll try to deal with the arguments of
my learned friend in the order that he has presented them but where necessary
I will have to transpose certain parts of my skeletal arguments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#3:1:A>
My Lord the first argument of my learned friend was that the learned
judge had considered the wrong issues

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#4:1:A>
On this point of course I beg to differ

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#5:1:A>
The learned judge had stated that there were two issues as it were
one whether the Appellants were aware of the forty-five per cent rule before
the Respondents placed their order for the T V sets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#6:1:A>
Then as a corollary to this he said whether the issue of the
Singapore certificates of origin connoted compliance with the forty-five per
cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#7:1:A>
And then the second issue he said was whether P W three had
discussed the forty-five per cent rule with D W one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#8:1:A>
These issues were read to your Lordship earlier and appear at the
Record of Appeal page three hundred and twenty-five paragraph E and continues
right through to page three hundred and twenty-six paragraphs A B and C

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#9:1:A>
Now my learned friend has pointed out that the issues as stated by
the learned judge here differ from what was presented in my opening The
position is that it was never pleaded in the amended defence that the
Defendants or the Appellants were unaware of the forty-five per cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#10:1:A>
The amended defence appears on the Record of Appeal at pages ten to
eleven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#11:1:A>
There is merely denial and put to strict proof but there was no
allegation that the Defendants were not aware of the forty-five per cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#12:1:A>
As my Lords would be aware it's rather difficult at the opening
speech to contemplate all the issues that will arise in the course of the
evidence given particularly when the same is not obvious from the pleadings
themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#13:1:A>
In the statement of claim at page seven of the Record of Appeal my
Lord paragraph four I'd pleaded that it was an express term of the contract
that the T V sets supplied would be issued with certificates of Singapore
origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#14:1:A>
I went on to plead the Plaintiffs content that in order for the T V
sets to be issued with certificates of Singapore origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#15:1:A>
The Plaintiffs say that the defence well knew the purpose of their
requirement of the certificates of origin was to ensure that this forty-five
per cent requirement existed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#16:1:A>
To my mind what this implies or what this connotes is that the
Plaintiffs wanted to ensure that this forty-five per cent rule would be
complied with and that is why they had requested for the Singapore
certificates of origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#17:1:A>
Now in the course of evidence as developed at the trial the
Appellant's witnesses had repeatedly said that they had no knowledge
whatsoever of the forty-five per cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#18:1:A>
So it became an underlying issue whether the Appellants were aware
of this forty-five per cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#19:1:A>
In my statement of claim at this paragraph four Record of Appeal
page seven I mentioned very clearly the Plaintiffs say the Defence well knew
the purpose of the requirement of the C O was to ensure that forty-five per
cent requirement existed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#20:1:A>
So knowledge is then an issue because the Defendants had denied
this aspect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#21:1:A>
My case was that the Appellants knew of this forty-five per cent
rule and it was to ensure its compliance that the Singapore certificate was
asked for and required but the Appellants maintained that they were not aware

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#22:1:A>
So the issue of knowledge of the Appellants then was very material
in this case and it was a crux issue that surfaced throughout the course of
the trial

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#23:1:A>
Of course the other ancillary issues like whether it was to ensure
compliance that the Respondents had contracted for the Singapore certificate
of origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#24:1:A>
Whether it was an express term of the contract that this forty-five
per cent rule were complied with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#25:1:A>
Whether it was an implied term that there should be compliance with
this forty-five per cent rule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#26:1:A>
Would all of whether the Appellants were aware of this forty-five
per cent rule before the Respondents placed their order

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#27:1:A>
Now in this regard the discussions which P W three had with D W one
the first witness for the Appellants in the course of the trial which the
parties had before the order was placed would be very important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#28:1:A>
Now as my learned friend had accepted in his submissions to my
Lords he accepts that there was evidence in conflict here between the parties
in regard to the discussions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#29:1:A>
Now P W three's evidence of the discussions was that he had
definitely asked the Respondent's D W one whether he would the Singapore
company that's the Appellants would definitely be able to comply with the
criteria for origin requirements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#30:1:A>
They said they were fully aware of this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#31:1:A>
This is at the Record of Appeal the evidence appears at Record of
Appeal thirty-eight B to D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#32:1:A>
They said they were fully aware of this and to give him further
confirmation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#33:1:A>
D W one further supported by saying that they had had their own
plant manufacturing T V tubes in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#34:1:A>
He assured that in addition he is planning to send a set of
moldings to inject plastic cabinets to increase the Singapore content

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#35:1:A>
And in further cross-examination of P W three at Record of Appeal
forty-two D he said P W three gave evidence the forty-five per cent content
rule was discussed between the parties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#36:1:A>
At Record of Appeal forty-three the P W three insisted that he had
specifically discussed the forty-five per cent rule with the Appellants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#37:1:A>
In page after page of the evidence of P W three we see that P W
three insisted that the forty-five per cent contact rule had been discussed
between the parties <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#X38:1:A>
CHIEF JUSTICE : Where is this please Page </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#39:1:A>
Your honour if I could refer you to my skeletal arguments at
page three under the subheading evidence one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#40:1:A>
I have made a notation of all the relevant pages and the paragraphs
involved <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#X41:1:A>
CHIEF JUSTICE: Ah yes </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#42:1:A>
Now at the Record of Appeal page forty-three paragraph C it was put
to him you did not inform the Defendants of the forty-five per cent local
content rule and the answer I deny that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#43:1:A>
They know about it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#44:1:A>
We had specifically discussed it prior to the issue of letter of
credit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#45:1:A>
We also discussed plastic toolings for plastic cabinets to be
transferred to Singapore so that the Singapore content could be increased to
meet the Singapore requirement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#46:1:A>
This was an important feature for Singapore goods to be imported
into England

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#47:1:A>
Goods must be manufactured in Singapore and also the forty-five per
cent local content rule must be complied with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#48:1:A>
And then at page forty-four of the Record of Appeal paragraphs E to
F there's mention the forty-five per cent content rule was orally discussed
between me and the Taiwan company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#49:1:A>
Towards the last paragraph put you did not mention the forty-five
per cent content rule and the answers I did inform them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#50:1:A>
In fact we discussed the matter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#51:1:A>
At page forty-five of the Record of Appeal paragraph C there it's
put just before the re-examination it's put at all material times neither you
nor the Defendants knew of the 45 forty-five per cent rule and P W three
testifies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#52:1:A>
We both knew of this rule because it was an understanding that they
use local materials and further increase the Singapore content

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#53:1:A>
The plastic moldings would be transferred to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#54:1:A>
They have made these arrangements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#55:1:A>
Now D W one's evidence on these discussions were different and were
in conflict with P W three's

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#56:1:A>
The evidence of D W one appears at page forty-nine of the Record of
Appeal forty-nine right at the top your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#57:1:A>
It said D W one said I only told Mr Pandia that we were able to
obtain the certificate of origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#58:1:A>
I did not mention to him about the criteria requirement as I was
not aware of that at that time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#59:1:A>
I am not aware of the percentage cost of the moldings in so far as
the total cost is concerned

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#60:1:A>
It also appears at fifty-two paragraphs C to E

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#61:1:A>
This is D W one's evidence on discussions between the parties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#62:1:A>
At paragraph C do you recall receiving a telephone call from Mister
Pandia late September in nineteen seventy-eight or early October
seventy-eight and the answer comes there were many telephone calls I can't
remember when they were made

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#63:1:A>
He asked me if I could obtain a certificate of origin for the T V
sets manufactured in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#64:1:A>
I told him that Singapore was making picture tubes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#65:1:A>
I also told him that we were going to send to Singapore some
moldings to make cabinets for T V sets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#66:1:A>
Only with picture tube and cabinets the content might not be
forty-five per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#67:1:A>
Administrative and labour charges would cost fifteen per cent and
the material cost would cost eight-five per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#68:1:A>
Then at page fifty-four paragraph E D W one testified

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#69:1:A>
In the course of our conversation I told him that our Singapore
company manufactured picture tubes in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#70:1:A>
I told him that the T V sets from Singapore would have picture
tubes made in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#71:1:A>
I also told him that cabinets for the T V sets would also be made
in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#72:1:A>
I told him that I would be sending the moldings to Singapore to
meet Plaintiff's requirement in regard to the casings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#73:1:A>
My Lord in the light of the different versions of the discussions
my submission is that the learned judge had to assess the truth of the two
witnesses here in the light of their conflicting evidence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#74:1:A>
My Lord it is my submission that in regard to the discussion the
judgment of the learned judge comprises findings of fact based on the
credibility or reliability of the witnesses rather than inferences drawn from
specific facts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#75:1:A>
Now on this matter I would refer your Honour to the judgment which
is at that part of report of the judgment at Record of Appeal three hundred
and thirty-one page three hundred and thirty-one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#76:1:A>
It's at paragraph E under the title issue B

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#77:1:A>
Issue B has been defined by his Lordship at Record of Appeal three
hundred and twenty-six to mean whether did P W three and D W one discuss the
forty-five per cent rule before the order was placed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#78:1:A>
Now here the judgment reads on this issue the evidence of Pandia P
W three reads as follows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#79:1:A>
Then there is then set out the evidence of P W three which is at
the Record of Appeal page thirty-eight B to D and which I had referred your
Honour to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#80:1:A>
Over the page at page 332 of the Record of Appeal the judgment goes
on on this aspect of Pandia's evidence Lyn's reads then follows a note of <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#X81:1:A>
CHIEF JUSTICE: Just one moment Which part of three hundred and
thirty-two are you reading from </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#82:1:A>
I am at para C <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#X83:1:A>
CHIEF JUSTICE : I see </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#84:1:A>
On this aspect of Pandia's evidence <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#X85:1:A>
CHIEF JUSTICE : Oh yes </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#86:1:A>
Lyn D W one's evidence reads and then there's a quotation of Lyn's
evidence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#87:1:A>
And after the quotation the learned judge then says at paragraph G
of that page my Lord on this aspect of the case on a balance of probabilities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#88:1:A>
I accept the evidence of Pandia that he had discussed with Lyn the
reasons for and implications for providing the T V sets with the Singapore
certificate of origin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#89:1:A>
Your Honour there can be no clearer case to my mind that the
learned judge was here weighing the probability of the two versions of
evidence that was given and he had preferred the evidence of P W three in
favour of D W one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#90:1:A>
My Lord now in regard to this portion of the argument my learned
friend had cited the cases of Ben Max versus Austin Motor and Ward versus
Thomas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-061#91:1:A>
I don't propose to turn up the pages because the two cases decided
was that there is a distinction between findings of fact based on credibility
of witnesses and a finding of fact based on inferences from specific facts
that is a difference between perception of facts from evaluation of facts
