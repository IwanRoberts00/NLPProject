<h> Concluding Observations </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#4:1>
The observations made in this final chapter focus on individual
attitudes, and the family and community strengths which contribute to
successful adaptation to aging.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#5:1>
Attention is paid also to the structural aspects of the community and
to the points at which support breaks down so that the elderly Malay becomes
vulnerable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#6:1>
While most of these observations are based on the respondents, namely
the current generation of the over sixties, speculations are also made about
future cohorts of Malay elderly persons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#7:1>
From the data of this study, it appears that the present generation of
Malay elderly accept, philosophically, failing health and minor physical
ailments which attend increasing age.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#8:1>
Self-dependence is important to the elderly person, whether this takes
the form of separate accommodation, independent income or the capacity to
contribute to the household in material or nonmaterial ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#9:1>
certain activities are seen as appropriate to old age.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#10:1>
The later years are viewed, in particular, as a time for prayer,
other religious activities and family and close friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#11:1>
The younger generation perceives an older person as an essential part
of a family without which a family unit is incomplete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#12:1>
The senior person has special roles in life transitions of younger
family members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#13:1>
Engagements and marriages, for instance, are events during which the
special experience and knowledge of the elderly are called upon.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#14:1>
On the whole the Malay elderly in the present time are encircled by a
well-functioning family network which minimises the discomforts attending the
process of growing old.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#15:1>
The low rate of Malay utilisation of public services reflects, to
some degree, a successful adaptation of the Malay family, to this stage of
the family life cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#16:1>
The adaptation is largely dependent on family strengths, many
examples of which are revealed in the study.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#17:1>
The relationships of the elderly within the family network are
characterised by interdependence, provided the elderly person is fit, mobile
or has independent means.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#18:1>
The interdependence in family relations is demonstrated by the large
number of Malays over 60 years of age who participate actively in functions
associated with maintaining the households in which their children also live.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#19:1>
The most valuable service provided by the fit elderly is that of
child care which frees the mother for work outside the home.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#20:1>
In this respect, a grandmother in particular, contributes in
unrecognised ways, to the national economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#21:1>
This cloak of invisibility once attached to wives and mothers is now
worn by grandmothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#22:1>
In return, the elderly parent receives shelter, financial
contributions from children, frequent visits if they live in separate
households, and implicit assurance of acre when needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#23:1>
An important aspect of family adaptation to an elderly parent who
might eventually require care is the assumption that the task of providing
this care will fall mainly on the shoulders of a daughter, and the general
acceptance of this task by a daughter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#24:1>
This role is one aspect of nurturing other family members and
maintaining the home, which are expected of women.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#25:1>
The acceptance of this role by Malay women is clear in the high
proportion of females who are housewives among the respondents' children,
despite the higher levels of education among women in that generation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#26:1>
The preference of Malay parents for being in the care of a daughter,
is linked to the belief that a daughter is more likely than a daughter-in-law
to manja a parent, a belief that appears to be well-founded.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#27:1>
The daughter who undertakes the care of the parent does more than
manja.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#28:1>
The new responsibility sometimes means giving up a job, and re-
arranging her daily routine.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#29:1>
However difficult the task of nursing an ailing or bedridden parent,
the daughters in this study, who undertook the tasks, found ways to cope, and
despite feelings of being burdened did not seriously consider abandoning the
responsibility or committing the parent to institutional care.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#30:1>
Flexibility in the role of men also contributes to family strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#31:1>
Despite their exclusion from household tasks during their earlier
years, several - though not all - older men seem prepared to involve
themselves in some household function after retirement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#32:1>
Younger men participate in nursing duties, especially those which
require physical strength, such as lifting and carrying a bedridden parent
for bathing and other toilet needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#33:1>
Flexibility of the younger male is also evident in the willingness of
some husbands to waive the traditional privileges that accrue to their
position as head of household, and to accept that priority be given to the
care of an elderly parent or parent-in-law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#34:1>
Within the family circle the dependence of elderly parents is
accepted by children even though the obligation of filial care is not
explicit in the process of their upbringing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#35:1>
The older generation of Malays attribute this sense of responsibility
to religious training through which proper values are inculcated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#36:1>
The next generation hopes that the manner in which they discharge
their responsibilities towards their parents will serve as models for their
own children.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#37:1>
While cultural values might generate the basic impulse to support
parents, more tangible factors make this support feasible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#38:1>
Good health, not only of the elderly, but also of the 'carers' who
are in their 50s or even 60s by the time their elderly parents begin to need
special care, is one feature which reduces the potential burden that the
degenerative process can represent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#39:1>
More salient, however, is the role of large families in facilitating
the care of parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#40:1>
The average number of children per parent in this generation of the
Malay elderly is six.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#41:1>
Assuming responsibility for a dependent parent becomes easier if the 'carer'
has siblings who will share some tasks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#42:1>
Sharing may take various forms, namely, financial contributions,
frequent visiting, assistance in specific activities, nursing on a rotational
basis, or provision of respite.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#43:1>
A second advantage of the large family is the increased chance that
includes a daughter who is able to undertake the care of a parent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#44:1>
Outside the immediate family, various forms of social relations
supplement family strengths in the Malay community.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#45:1>
The collective and individual responsibility towards the needy is
apparent, as the 'needy' includes the elderly especially if socially isolated
and poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#46:1>
Three forms of communal response are revealed in this study.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#47:1>
The first is the system of Zakat Fitrah, involving a mandatory
contribution by all Muslims.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#48:1>
Among other things, it functions as a mechanism for the
redistribution of wealth, though the elderly reap the benefits only once a
year.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#49:1>
The second culturally determined response to need, less formal and
more dependent on individual motivations than the Zakat Fitrah, are the
practices involved in the concept of sedekah.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#50:1>
Out of this study emerged several examples of how the needy elderly
Malay benefited from, and in subtle ways relied upon, this obligation of the
more wealthy towards the poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#51:1>
The third indication of the cultural sense of responsibility for
those in need is a form of patronage evident in the practice of 'adopting' an
individual.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#52:1>
This is demonstrated by examples of younger people who assume the
role of 'patron' of the older person, visiting, bringing food and other gifts
and making financial contributions to the elderly person who has been 'adopted'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#53:1>
The acceptance of the relationship by the older person is obvious in
the descriptor angkat ( adopted) attached to the relationship labels of anak
( child) or cucu ( grandchild) used for the patron.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#54:1>
The relationships between the patron and the beneficiary are often
linked to childhood histories.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#55:1>
In addition to the responses to need, other features in the Malay
community add further strands to the social network of the elderly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#56:1>
Among these are the semi-formal or informal groups that form
spontaneously when Malays share a neighbourhood, and show similarities to
associations which mark pre-urban lifestyles.1 One example are the jawatan
kuasa blok or block committees which emerge among the Malays who reside in
HDB estates.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#57:1>
The second example are the groups which form on the basis of a common
experience, such as dependence on Public Assistance or on other social
services.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#58:1>
These function as useful reference groups as the shared status
reduces stigma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#59:1>
The groups also represent a means for mutual support, as the members
benefit from the sharing of tasks, information and expertise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#60:1>
On the other side of the coin of family and community strengths are
structural features affecting the Malay community which set limits to the
supportive function of cultural ideals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#61:1>
Furthermore, there is ample evidence that various systems of support
break down at certain points.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#62:1>
Identification of these points is important for deliberation of ways
in which to ensure adequate security for the Malay elderly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#63:1>
Despite the inclination towards independence, some form od
dependence, financial and/or for shelter, is fairly prevalent in this
generation of elderly Malays.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#64:1>
The dependence stems largely from structural features including a
history of low levels of education, low-wage employment and meagre retirement
benefits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#65:1>
Even if the Malay over 60 is able and willing to work in order to
maintain independence, opportunities for employment are limited, for most, to
unskilled jobs for which the income earned is barely sufficient for
subsistence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#66:1>
Such constraints are especially applicable to women, a high
proportion of whom received little or no education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#67:1>
The low wage of women is of significance to both sexes since, as this
study indicates, several old old men depend upon the earnings of their young
old wives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#68:1>
Communal norms and ideals relating to family relations and community
functions are subject to individual difference in any cultural group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#69:1>
Variations in individual personality and behaviour contribute to
family dynamics and result in the strengthening or weakening of the family's
capacity to provide support for all its members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#70:1>
In this study several variations were encountered.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#71:1>
The inadequacies in some families related to the absence of children,
while in others, potential support for the elderly parent was eroded by
strains in interpersonal relationships.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#72:1>
It has to be concluded, therefore, that no community, whatever the
cultural norms, can rely with confidence on family strengths for the
provision of all supports required for the processes of aging.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#73:1>
Community association while softening the impact of life in a housing
estate in Singapore for the Malay community have not sufficiently anticipated
or responded to the needs of the elderly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#74:1>
The benefits of spontaneous self-help groups are limited to the
resources in terms of knowledge and expertise of the members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#75:1>
Other communal supports, such as channelled through the Zakat Fitrah,
the khairat kematian, the jawatan kuasa blok and the neighbourhood mosques,
continue to function in traditional ways which tend to focus on social ills,
such as poverty and specific family crises, mainly bereavement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#76:1>
Such assistance is remedial and minimally supportive in the full
range of the needs of the elderly and the families upon whom they depend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#77:1>
The narrowness of function of communal associations applies to two
dimensions of the lives of older people - the opportunity to contribute to
community life and the accessibility of services.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#78:1>
Opportunities for participation are limited by several factors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#79:1>
The first is the priority given to high levels of energy and physical
activity associated with youth, thus easing out the elderly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#80:1>
Active participation is also frequently linked to the existence of
prior social connections, thus the elderly person with newly-found disposable
time faces difficulties in finding a niches in establishing groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#81:1>
Moreover, obtaining help often requires a certain amount of how-how,
mobility and strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#82:1>
In these circumstances social isolation is perpetuated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#83:1>
In community activities which are not specific to communal groups,
there are additional barriers to active participation of the Malay elderly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#84:1>
These barriers relate to the language in which proceedings are
conducted, and the feeling of exclusion experienced by people of a minority
group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#85:1>
Furthermore, general community activities tend not to be responsive
to the special minority needs, such as prayer times.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#86:1>
The effects of these various features of community groups are
two-fold.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#87:1>
First, the community as a whole fails to derive full advantage from
the potential of its elderly citizens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#88:1>
Second, the disadvantaged and immobile elderly most in need of
alternative social networks to substitute for families which are non-existent
and weak, are not reached by community groups. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#X89:1>
The current situation of the Malay elderly will be subject to
change, as are all aspects of life in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-014#X90:1>
Since plans must be based on forecasts as well as analysis of the
present, attempts are made here to anticipate some possible features of the
future. </X> </I>
