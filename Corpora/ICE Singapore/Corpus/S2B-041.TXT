<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#1:1:A>
Well a very warm welcome to all of you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#2:1:A>
And uh I'd like to take the opportunity before I begin to welcome uh
Dean uh Ernest Chew who is uh with us this morning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#3:1:A>
Uh I'm sure we all have heard of the film uh terminator two
judgement day even uh if we did not part with our hard-earned money at the
cinemas to watch it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#4:1:A>
Uh we all know what the film is about in the film uh uh cyborg uh
model T8 100

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#5:1:A>
That's what it's called fights it out with the latest advance in
scientific devilry a model t1000

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#6:1:A>
Now the term cyborg is of course very well-known to science fiction
fans or technobugs as in uh as they are called

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#7:1:A>
However the term does not occur in the Collins Cobuild English
Language Dictionary even if cybernetics is explained at length in the same
dictionary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#8:1:A>
Indeed in the film terminator the ah model terminator t8 100 spends
a long time in the film explaining what a cyborg is

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#9:1:A>
Now I will not bore you with the details as to what cyborg is since
we are in technologically aware Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#10:1:A>
However interestingly techno as a prefix to a range of terms and
activities including techno societies and techno mania occurs in the Cobuild
Dictionary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#11:1:A>
Now all these of course does not mean that I I'm uh criticising the
Cobuild Dictionary or its short comings

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#12:1:A>
Personally I find a very useful tool

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#13:1:A>
What I am doing is to remind us of the strategy of that particular
dictionary which as its preface goes is I quote

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#14:1:A>
To make a feature of the most common words of the language and to
pay to them very close attention

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#15:1:A>
It is also to remind us what its editor John Sinclair notes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#16:1:A>
That the dictionary any dictionary he says as a single volume quote
cannot hope to do justice to the immense variety that is found in modern
English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#17:1:A>
He then goes on to remind us there are now whole dictionaries of
regional varieties of the English language including the Marquarie dictionary
of Australian English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#18:1:A>
Now we're very fortunate to have with us today very many
distinguished speakers of which we have uh Ms Susan Butler

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#19:1:A>
Mrs Susan Butler of the Marquarie Dictionary she will be joining us
over the next two or three days together with a panel of very distinguished
speakers including of course Dr Jonathan Webster who is coming in from Hong
Kong city polytechnic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#20:1:A>
Uh he's not here yet but he's going to talk to you on computers and
lexicography

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#21:1:A>
Now the crucial question that is before us today I think is surely
will someday a dictionary of Singapore English become be the outcome of the
deliberations of this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#22:1:A>
That's always somewhere at the back of our minds as we sit down to
discuss

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#23:1:A>
We will also I think uh be asking ourselves will that dictionary be
seen as the first step in establishing Singapore English firmly as a regional
English in its own right

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#24:1:A>
Now this whole question of whether Singapore English is going to be
a regional English or is it going to be a variety of regional English or is
it going to be a series of colloquialisms is invariably going to be a thorny
problem

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#25:1:A>
Some will argue that Singapore English is to be distinguished from
Singlish

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#26:1:A>
That is Singapore English as it is spoken by me as it is used by a
whole lot of people must be distinguished from Singlish and others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#27:1:A>
On the other hand will argue that to do so is to be ideologically
prejudiced in favour of a certain group of people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#28:1:A>
I think next few days there might be much debate and I certainly
look forward to the many varieties of opinion that will be forthcoming

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#29:1:A>
However let me exercise the unfair advantage which I have by virtue
of opening this conference

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#30:1:A>
And uh say that while we may debate ideology we should never allow
it to stand in the way of making progress even uh small steps

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#31:1:A>
There are many things that can be done even as we are discussing
ideology questions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#32:1:A>
For example like how we can begin the work of establishing a corpus
of English as it is used in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#33:1:A>
Indeed of the region especially Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#34:1:A>
Now in some ways the work of corpora building has already been
started by the department

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#35:1:A>
There is the international corpus of English that the department is
supporting headed by professor Nihalani Paroo Nihalani as the principal
investigator and uh with his team A/P Prabhu and Dr Anne Pakir

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#36:1:A>
In addition to we will also have to work out the whole business of
the design of the database that is going to need particular attention among
the difficulties

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#37:1:A>
I can foresee is that while most dictionary databases privilege a
text base lexicon

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#38:1:A>
We may find that a substantial portion of lexical items in
Singapore Malaysia are speech-based for precisely the reason that there are
not that many texts in Singapore which will lend weight to this kind of uh
naming

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#39:1:A>
Or emphasising another important factor will I suspect be the
relative unimportance of the traditional distinction between lexical and
encyclopaedic information

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#40:1:A>
Indeed in Singapore a constant cross-over between the two may in
fact be desirable in a dictionary dealing with the workings of language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#41:1:A>
In a regional context all of these will I think demand answers and
in some cases decisions and uh some of these may begin to emerge over the
next few days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#42:1:A>
Of course in many ways while the designs storage and retrieval of
lexical databases have improved by leaps and bounds some things have not
changed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#43:1:A>
There are many similarities between any dictionary-making even in
the twentieth century with that of Dr Johnson's two and a half centuries ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#44:1:A>
With any dictionaries you still need helpers although nowadays we
call them research assistants rather than the <unclear> word </unclear> that
Johnson had

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#45:1:A>
We don't tell them this is what to do

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#46:1:A>
We ask them to go out and do research

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#47:1:A>
You will also certainly need funding which Johnson as you know
found in Robert Docksley and uh his consortium of book publishers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#48:1:A>
You will also have to make a decision as to what books to go in uh
what items to go in and what not items to go in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#49:1:A>
Now it's useful in all these to remember what Johnson conceived a
dictionary to be for him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#50:1:A>
The dictionary he wrote in his famous plan was above all to be an
useful book

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#51:1:A>
It had the task of helping the reader to use words and to
understand the words of others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#52:1:A>
A dictionary was also he wrote in a subsequent preface a reflection
of lift experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#53:1:A>
The kind of experience that shapes language words are like men he
tells us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#54:1:A>
And he says quote when they are not gaining strength they are
generally losing it though art may sometimes prolong their duration

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#55:1:A>
It will rarely give them perpetuity and their changes will be
almost always informing us that language is the work of men

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#56:1:A>
A being from whom permanence and stability cannot be expected

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#57:1:A>
I suppose that's why we do not have one dictionary we've many many
dictionaries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#58:1:A>
But also Johnson reminds us in this way that to make a dictionary
is in many ways a record of the lives the conditions and the aspirations of
the people of the society who use words

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#59:1:A>
I think this is a serious venture and it need support and careful
thought

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#60:1:A>
Now the department will continue to support the and to extend work
in uh the various areas of corpora building

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#61:1:A>
It will forge strong and I'm sure fruitful relations with
institutions and bodies like Marquarie University and Marquarie database

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#62:1:A>
And it will initiate and promote work being key areas in the usage
of the English language in Singapore at the same time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#63:1:A>
I hope that today's workshop will be the first of a series of
annual department seminars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#64:1:A>
And uh activities some of these workshops will hopefully attract
funding from CAS

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#65:1:A>
While for others if they are more related to wards publishers we
may hope to find yah support from publishers and other bodies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#66:1:A>
Finally the department will like to thank the various speakers and
uh to the dean for gracing the occasion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#67:1:A>
We will also like to thank the dean's office and the centre for
advanced studies and in particular its director A/P Ong Jin Hui for
supporting our workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#68:1:A>
We will also like to thank John Wiley for his grant and gesture of
support

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#69:1:A>
Finally my thanks go to Dr Anne Pakir and the team of workers for
once again providing a meticulous piece of organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#70:1:A>
Thank you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#71:1:A>
Enjoy the workshop </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#72:2:B>
Ah thank you Anne

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#73:2:B>
Now uh Anne's little poem from Stella Kon reminds us that the study
of words uh begins above all with the study of man and his environment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#74:2:B>
No matter what lexicographers do and uh what we call ourselves
there must be above a love for words

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#75:2:B>
What has emerged over the last few days is the immense scope as
well as the immense opportunities of the task of Singapore dictionary making

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#76:2:B>
The problem as Susan pointed out in the first day is not just with
getting a dictionary out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#77:2:B>
That's the first thing but also the vast amount of continuing
research citation and collation that will have to be done after that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#78:2:B>
Because as I told Susan just now it's very likely that the first
dictionary that comes out is almost immediately going to become obsolete

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#79:2:B>
People will say ah but there you are you know you don't have this
word and that word so the first dictionary will very much be a testing ground
for subsequent dictionaries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#80:2:B>
There will be a there will have to be a number of dictionaries
before a stability is achieved

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#81:2:B>
Now here I think the university is in a good position to bring
together to initiate and to extend the continuing work of corpora building of
collation citation and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#82:2:B>
In this connection we hope that the conference will do at least two
things

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#83:2:B>
There is an interest in starting a small group of people interested
in works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#84:2:B>
And in lexicography that is to carry on after this conference is
over

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#85:2:B>
And uh uhm a title suggested for such a group is lexispore which is
a combination for lexicography and ah Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#86:2:B>
It might not be uh uh bad term especially when you think of spore
as a building point yah not uh uh a malevolence spore or a benign spore for
starting and growing something

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#87:2:B>
So you know the department will support the work of such a group it
can include people like Rosemary who has been uh doing uh a lot of work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#88:2:B>
People like Ismail Tony

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#89:2:B>
People from the ministry ah Anne Ivy and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#90:2:B>
Uh and all of you all who are interested the second idea of course
is to take the idea of getting a dictionary together a step further

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#91:2:B>
Now the question here is how much will the cost of such a project
be

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#92:2:B>
That is the cost of produce producing a dictionary against the cost
of putting together the corpus the designing of the database the paying of
the research assistants and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#93:2:B>
It's not just the final product but also the whole thing of
assembling the team

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#94:2:B>
That is why I have suggested that perhaps a shared multitask corpus
with interchangeability and interinuseability be ah looked at very carefully

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#95:2:B>
Because if you have such a team ah of people interested together
sharing together the work of corpus building then it becomes that much easier

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#96:2:B>
Now uh there seems there remains it seems to me some hesitation
over the corpus of the dictionary as to what eventually it can lead to

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#97:2:B>
I think that perhaps we may look at it in terms as a continuing
progress <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-041#X98:2:B>
If we think of a dictionary we're not thinking of the just the
first dictionary we're thinking of at least a decade's work I think before
something like a final or stable dictionary can come about I think that we
are looking at least in terms of three dictionaries hem to start with perhaps
a history of or dictionary of Singlish a collection of words which fascinates
people and ah which we are trying to put together to give some meaning to
secondly you are thinking of a dictionary ah which can be useful for students
and to the educated public and thirdly you are thinking of a kind of defining
dictionary something like the Singapore version of the OED now these three
objectives may change over the years we do not know until we start work uh we
are as I say thinking of at least a decade's work at any rate I think the
decision whether to go ahead or not I think in some ways rest upon people
like you the department can support the department can initiate but if in
some ways you find that it is necessary put the group together start
lexispore for small for in small way and then we can begin ah talking in the
meantime also the department will hopefully be exploring with interested
publishers and also with other funding authorities about how far we can take
the project I'd like to thank you all for being uh such good participants
thank you </X> </I>
