<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#3:1>
<h> Background To The Hypothesis </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#4:1>
I chose this project because it worries me that so much store is put
by cloze scores in the kinds of proficiency tests I have been involved in
like the Qualifying English Test ( QEI) at the National University of
Singapore and the RELC English Proficiency Test.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#5:1>
In the former, students are exempted from having to take remedial
English classes if their scores on the 100 item cloze section of the QET are
above a predetermined percentage ( ie the percentage is arrived at
intuitively and does not represent the median of the test population).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#6:1>
During the course of teaching the students who are given remedial
English lessons, I have noticed that scores on cloze seem to improve with
practice.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#7:1>
But, not all students who do well on the cloze ( especially by the
exact word scoring method) necessarily write as proficiently as their cloze
scores would indicate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#8:1>
Ceteris paribus cloze scores are claimed by some researchers as being
highly correlated to other tests of language ability including
free-expression writing, ( Shohamy 1983; Chavez-Oller et al 1985; Hale et al
1989).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#9:1>
What then is the exact nature of the validity of a cloze test of
proficiency and what degree of proficiency does it show?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#10:1>
<h> My Hypothesis </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#11:1>
My hypothesis is that cloze tests are as mechanical to complete as
they are to construct and score.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#12:1>
Furthermore that test scores on the cloze are not as indicative of
actual language proficiency as has been claimed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#13:1>
Relatively high scores can be obtained by testees who in actual terms
have low language proficiency, through extra-linguistic factors such as luck
( especially with content words in exact word scoring).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#14:1>
And lower scores could be obtained by testees who otherwise have high
levels of language proficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#15:1>
If this is so, then the validity and consequently the reliability of
cloze procedure in proficiency testing may be questionable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#16:1>
It is with this hypothesis in mind that I conducted a small scale
experiment to illustrate my point.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#17:1>
This paper reviews the major work related to my hypothesis, describes
my experiment, discusses my findings and presents some conclusions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#18:1>
<h> Literature Overview </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#19:1>
This overview is divided into four sections: historical, research
supporting cloze, research objecting to aspects of cloze and research
suggesting variations of cloze.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#20:1>
Historical Overview Taylor ( 1953) developed cloze originally as an
index for test readability, ( how accessible a text would be to readers).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#21:1>
The psychological traits for cloze are underpinned by the Gestalt
notion of closure, ( the completion of pictures or shapes by subjects as an
indication of how their mind functions).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#22:1>
Taylor's cloze procedure replicated this trait by requiring testees
to replace original words which had been blanked out in a text.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#23:1>
The rate of accuracy at which testees could fill in the blanks with
the exact original words would show how easy or difficult a text was to read.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#24:1>
Over the years cloze has become a test of " reader-ability" ( Johnson
1981) in understanding a text, as well as an important instrument in
placement and proficiency tests not only in the classroom but also in
nation-wide norm referenced tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#25:1>
Much has been written about cloze validity and reliability over the
last 37 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#26:1>
A pattern emerges of a group of researchers who are pro-cloze,
another who are against it and a third whose research attempts to redress the
problems raised by the second group in order to be reconciled with the merits
of cloze proposed by the first group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#27:1>
It is this pattern which I wish to discuss below.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#28:1>
<h> Pro-Cloze </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#29:1>
Cloze was adopted by language testers to test general proficiency in
the ascent of the Unitary Hvpothesis Theory ( a holistic view of language
learning and teaching) because cloze lends itself to the notion of a global
view of language proficiency as it assesses more than two skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#30:1>
It is thought to be a good indicator of general language ability
because the testee is required to make use of contextual clues ( which draw
on comprehension skills) and to supply answers ( drawing on syntactic and
semantic mastery).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#31:1>
Oller supports the idea of cloze as a test of general proficiency, he
says: " the cloze procedure is sometimes construed to be a measure of reading
ability, though it may be just as much a measure of writing, listening and
speaking ability" ( 1979: 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#32:1>
Shohamy ( 1983) is equally pro-cloze, claiming the highest
correlation of cloze to other language tests of proflciency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#33:1>
Her study showed a significant concurrent validity of cloze to the
oral Interview of 0.872.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#34:1>
Prima facie cloze seems to be integrative.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#35:1>
In classical cloze, a fixed deletion rate randomly deletes any part
of speech every nth word.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#36:1>
Hence in a 350 word passage there should be 50 blanks at a deletion
rate of every 7 words.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#37:1>
Those 50 blanks would contain both content and function words in
whatever ratio that particular text gave rise to.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#38:1>
This randomness is one of the statistical advantages that cloze is
said to have by its supporters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#39:1>
Its detractors argue that it is this randomness which gives rise to
unpredictability in the ratio of content to function words).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#40:1>
Another attraction of the cloze is the ease with which a test can be
constructed since Oller states that " the cloze procedure is probably
appropriate to just about any text" ( 1979: 364); Doer ( 1980) and
Chavez-Oller ( 1985) agree.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#41:1>
Heaton ( 1989) cites studies to show that ideally only 40-50 blanks
are needed at an optimum deletion rate of between every fifth to seventh word
to get an adequate number of test items).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#42:1>
Shohamy ( 1983) suggests that every eleventh word and 25 blanks is
equally optimal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#43:1>
Therefore the cloze appears to be a very economical test to
construct.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#44:1>
The cloze has high reliability in scoring when the exact word only is
scored as correct.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#45:1>
This is more probably because there is a high degree of objectivity
among raters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#46:1>
However it is this very construct validity and reliability which are
the most strongly debated issues in the work of detractors of cloze.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#47:1>
These debates are discussed in the next section.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#48:1>
<h> Anti-Cloze </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#49:1>
Some of the issues which have emerged are: the unpredictability of
content to function words in random cloze ( Alderson 1979), the subjectivity
of the text content ( Grotjahn 1987: Klein-Braley 1985), the insensitivity to
cross-sentential boundaries ( Alderson 1979: Farhady 1979: Bachman 1982:
Johnson 1982).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#50:1>
Alderson ( 1979) notes that changes in the deletion rate changes the
measure of proficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#51:1>
Hence cloze has an element of unpredictability which affects the
reliability of the test.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#52:1>
He argues that randomness may be justified when cloze is used as a
measure of text readability but not as a measure of proficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#53:1>
Grotjahn ( 1987) writing on an idea developed by Raatz and
Kein-Braley ( 1985), argues against the wholesale adoption of classical cloze
for the following reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#54:1>
Cloze is unfair because of text-specificity: there are many variables
affecting reliability such as deletion rate, choice of text and method of
scoring.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#55:1>
Furthermore the unpredictability of the ratio of content to function
words affects the kind or degree of proficiency being measured.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#56:1>
Oller ( 1979) and Chavez-Oller ( 1985) claim that choice of text does
not matter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#57:1>
Johnson ( 1982) shows by illustration with a technical text on
Chomskian grammar that the choice of text does matter and that such a text
could not successfully be clozed except by a linguist.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#58:1>
Moreover even a general interest text may be culturally biased.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#59:1>
For example blank 94 in the 1988 QET required students to cloze the
phrase " ...Protestant Work ( 94)"

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#60:1>
While a careful examination of texts for readability and clozability
could minimise such problems, texts cannot be chosen completely free of
biased items especially in classical cloze tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#61:1>
One of the reasons why cloze is so strongly upheld by renowned
language testers such as Oller is because of its psychological trait of
global language skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#62:1>
Markham ( 1985: 423) suggests that " the cloze procedure may not
yield a valid and reliable assessment of global ( complete) comprehension.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#63:1>
He pits second language research which shows that cloze is sensitive
across sentences against first language research which says cloze is only
sensitive to its immediate environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#64:1>
His argument is supported by Farhady ( 1979), Johnson ( 1982),
Baehman ( 1982) and Klein-Braley ( 1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#65:1>
Because cloze is sensitive both to immediate environment ( function
words such as articles) and across sentences ( anaphors), one cannot be
certain that enough cross-essential items are present in any given text to
claim that global language skills are truly being tested.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#66:1>
As Johnson ( 1982) asks, what exactly is being assessed?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#67:1>
What degree of proficiency is being measured?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#68:1>
This insensitivity to discourse cohesion leads to the issue of lack
of discrimination.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#69:1>
There is no certainty about the ratio of content to function words
because of random deletion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#70:1>
This is important if content words ( adjectives, nouns, adverbs and
verbs) are more demanding to cloze than function words which can be
mechanically clozed, for instance the blank preceding a singular countable
noun in the absence of an adjective has to be clozed with an article.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#71:1>
To some extent I have found that the mechanics of cloze can be
taught, which in itself is a negative backwash effect ( cf.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#72:1>
Carrel 1985).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#73:1>
There is no discrimination of language skills when all the test items
in a cloze test are scored equally although some of the items may be more
difficult to cloze than others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#74:1>
Alderson ( 1979) argues that cloze tests are not suitable for higher
order language skills, although cloze may provide a measure of lower order
language proficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#75:1>
This is because cloze is more sensitive to the immediate environment
( Bachman 1982).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#76:1>
Johnson in agreeing with this argument, illustrates it with an
example of a cloze that can be completed without using global skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#77:1>
Heaton ( 1988) observes that cloze discriminates between the most and
the least proficient cloze testees in a given population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#78:1>
However, it does not discriminate within the middle band.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#79:1>
This means that the bulk of the population is not discriminated
finely enough; which may be a significant drawback in placement tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#80:1>
Statistically cloze is a valid instrument within a population for
relative measures of proficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#81:1>
However on an individual basis in terms of actual language
proficiency, cloze does not discriminate well enough ( Hughes 1989).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#82:1>
For example, a proficient candidate's score on a cloze scored by the
exact answer method may not be an accurate reflection of his actual
proficiency skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#83:1>
This lack of discrimination ( and fairness) leads to next issue of
scoring methods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#84:1>
Oller ( 1979) asserts that there is no significant difference in
scores between the exact word only and acceptable synonym method of scoring.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#85:1>
Furthermore Hinofotis ( 1980) says that there is a difference in
reliability between the two scoring methods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#86:1>
However, Brown ( 1980) shows that accepting synonyms gives
significantly higher scores.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#87:1>
Why is scoring an issue?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#88:1>
And is it a valid issue?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#89:1>
It is an issue because it involves conflicts of interests between two
fundamentals of testing - objectivity of the markers and fairness to the
testees.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#90:1>
Accepting the exact answer only appears more objective.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#91:1>
It is easier, but is it fair?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#92:1>
The original word is already a product of an author's idiosyncratic
diction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#93:1>
Is it fair to ask testees to guess at and replicate correctly this
idiosyncrasy?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#94:1>
Is it valid to assume that the ability to replace the exact original
word is indeed an irrefutable sign of proficiency?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#95:1>
Might not highly proficient testees cloze the blanks with acceptable
synonyms from their large vocabularies?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#96:1>
Surely, it is not enough to say that the majority of any given
population performs normally and therefore only relative proficiency is
necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#97:1>
Relative proficiency is only meaningful within a population: it has
no meaning outside of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#98:1>
Relative proficiency may be enough within an institution like the NUS
when deciding which students need remedial English classes most ( ceteris
paribus there is validity and reliability), but in national tests such as the
PSLE ( the Singapore Primary School Leaving Certificate) the moral dimension
becomes much stronger.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#99:1>
An individual's score relative to his classmates may deprive him of a
chance for secondary education or a place at a top secondary school. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X100:1>
However his actual abilities may be equal to a higher grade in
another cohort in another year.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X101:1>
A valid question may be how many such individuals exist?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X102:1>
And at what cost is the negative backwash effect on them and the
nation worth?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X103:1>
Castillo ( personal communication) says that the ability to replace
the exact original word is an indication of accurate reading and therefore
also proficiency ( here defined as the prediction of success in any given
course, not as elsewhere in this paper defined as language mastery).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X104:1>
Two objections which arise are: what is the exact nature of the
relationship between success on exact-word replication and success on a
course of language testing?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-006#X105:1>
Secondly Tatlonghari ( personal communication) talked of research
on schemata or the mental baggage brought by the reader to bear on the text.
