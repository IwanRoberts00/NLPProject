Friends this election is not about a mandate for the PAP or for
even Mr Goh Chok Tong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#2:1:A>
The PAP have 41 seats

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#3:1:A>
They have the mandate and they are the government for another 5
years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#4:1:A>
If you can believe their promises this election is now about whether
we the people of Singapore will be able to send a few opposition members to
parliament to perform the correct role and job

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#5:1:A>
The opposition should make the political system that we have in
Singapore is based on an assumption that there will be always at least two
parties in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#6:1:A>
If there is not then checks and balances which the system provides
will not work effectively

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#7:1:A>
There will be no harmony in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#8:1:A>
There will be no balance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#9:1:A>
It is not enough to have one opposition MP

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#10:1:A>
That is like asking one man to hold back the river or the sea by
himself he can do nothing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#11:1:A>
But if there are others to help him he can build the wall

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#12:1:A>
He can build the dam and stop the water

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#13:1:A>
How does an opposition MP do this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#14:1:A>
He does it by getting the support of many Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#15:1:A>
He explains why a government policy is a bad policy or could be
improved

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#16:1:A>
If the people support him he can speak on their behalf

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#17:1:A>
And with many people behind him the government must listen and they
have listened before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#18:1:A>
Chiam See Tong and J.B. Jeyaratnam went to parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#19:1:A>
We the people had no voice there was no

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#20:1:A>
Today in parliament ministers did not explain policies to you and
me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#21:1:A>
The government just told us what we had to do and fine us if we did
not do it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#22:1:A>
They used to force people to cut their hair in the sixties and
seventies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#23:1:A>
They used to tell people what sort of T-shirts to wear

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#24:1:A>
They told women who work in the civil service not to wear pants or
slacks to work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#25:1:A>
There was no consultation and no feedback

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#26:1:A>
They never held dialogue sessions with you in the past

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#27:1:A>
Those were the dark ages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#28:1:A>
Now things have changed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#29:1:A>
They know that they must listen to you because if they do not there
are opposition MPs who will make your voice heard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#30:1:A>
We now have a slightly more open and freer society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#31:1:A>
It is not a gift from the PAP it is a necessity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#32:1:A>
You the people of Singapore made them change by putting opposition
members in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#33:1:A>
We now in the middle ages of our political development but we must
come into the modern world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#34:1:A>
We must have a modern political system to match our modern economy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#35:1:A>
We saw what happened in the sixties and seventies when the PAP was
the only party in power

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#36:1:A>
They did not listen and if there is no opposition the PAP will not
listen to the voice of the old and the sick who cannot afford the new
hospital and medical charges

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#37:1:A>
Over a year ago the PAP introduced a hospital privatisation scheme

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#38:1:A>
They said we will the hospital more efficient but they did not tell
you that they will the hospital more expensive and their efficiency in the
PAP bible name pay and pay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#39:1:A>
The opposition members of parliament warned that this will be a
great burden on the poor and those people who were chronically ill

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#40:1:A>
The PAP removed nearly all the C class beds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#41:1:A>
Now they have discovered that we were right and in today's Straits
Times the PAP say that they are prepared to look again at the health policy
the old premises and assumptions can be looked at again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#42:1:A>
Why should the policy be reexamined again unless it was wrong in
the first place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#43:1:A>
Let me give you an example

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#44:1:A>
A lot of people who passed away many years ago were of people who
are dying now in Potong Pasir

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#45:1:A>
A lady came to me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#46:1:A>
She was unable to pay her conservancy charges

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#47:1:A>
Her husband was dying of bone cancer she herself was sick her
daughter and her son-in-law were working at two jobs just to pay the hospital
bills and the husband was only a C class patient

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#48:1:A>
I asked her about her medisave

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#49:1:A>
She said we have no more medisave they cannot pay their bills

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#50:1:A>
I am very sad to say I was not able to help her but this is the
position of many people in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#51:1:A>
It is very frightening to get sick if you are the sole bread winner
the only earner

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#52:1:A>
If you fall sick your family can be thrown out into the streets to
poverty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#53:1:A>
And if there is no opposition the PAP will not listen to the voice
of the non-graduate mother whose children do not have priority for
registration to the best primary schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#54:1:A>
Isn't it unfair that the children of better-off families whose
parents are more able to afford good tuition and give their children a good
study environment should also get priority for schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#55:1:A>
Where is the equality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#56:1:A>
Do you realise that if he was 6 six years today Goh Chok Tong would
not get priority in primary one registration because his mother was not a
graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#57:1:A>
If Mr Goh Chok Tong really believes people-bonding if he really
believes that the well-off and the successful must come back and help those
who are not so well-off

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#58:1:A>
How can he let such an unfair system continue

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#59:1:A>
And if there is no opposition the PAP will not listen to the voice
of the working mother who is paying a high levy for foreign maids so that she
can go out and earn that little bit more to make the family's ends meet

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#60:1:A>
There are a whole range of issues where we need an opposition in
parliament to bring out the issues to question the PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#61:1:A>
These are matters like independent schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#62:1:A>
The independent schools are not necessarily a bad thing but should
independent schools be allowed to take the best teachers away from the
ordinary schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#63:1:A>
Universities we had a 100% increase in university tuition fees
recently and they had 3 increases since 1987

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#64:1:A>
You have of course heard of the half tank rule now called the
three-quarter rule

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#65:1:A>
Watch out it will soon be the full-tank rule and higher HDB parking
charges 25 dollars to 50 dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#66:1:A>
Now all of these things I have just mentioned have something in
common

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#67:1:A>
They all happened after a general election

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#68:1:A>
I think it is very strange that when the PAP offers to give you
back your own CPF money in medisave or medifund they said wait vote for me
first I need your mandate then I will give you your money

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#69:1:A>
But they never ask you for your mandate when they take money form
you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#70:1:A>
This is a real double standard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#71:1:A>
Think about it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#72:1:A>
They never ask you for your endorsement when they take money from
your pocket

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#73:1:A>
I have said that Mr Chaim See Tong that this election is not a
general election because it does not affect who will be the government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#74:1:A>
There is no need for the PAP to get a mandate to rule

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#75:1:A>
They have it already

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#76:1:A>
Mr Goh had admitted this and changed his tactic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#77:1:A>
He now says he wants the people to endorse him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#78:1:A>
He says that he is the issue in this election not medisave medifund
edusave but he Goh Chok Tong he says that it is his open consultative style
freer more liberal Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#79:1:A>
I don't know about you but I think there are still so many rules
and regulations binding us all the time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#80:1:A>
I haven't seen much of this more liberal Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#81:1:A>
Maybe the only thing we have seen are the R movies that's all and
even this they are thinking of changing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#82:1:A>
Mr Goh hints to us other people have hinted to us that if you do
not support Goh Chok Tong then the PAP are hardliners might oust him in a
coup

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#83:1:A>
Maybe this is why Mr Goh has changed his campaign slogan in the
middle of a campaign

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#84:1:A>
He added a little word for stability

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#85:1:A>
Mr Goh Chok Tong has been watching too much CNN television

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#86:1:A>
He thinks he is President Gorbachev

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#87:1:A>
Maybe he thinks BG Lee is going to overthrow him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#88:1:A>
What happened in Russia is a lesson for us here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#89:1:A>
It shows that the people were not prepared to allow a return to
one-party rule there even when they have to look at tanks and armoured cars
in their face

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#90:1:A>
It was the democratically elected opposition that saved Mr
Gorbachev and the Soviet Union from his own party hardliners

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#91:1:A>
I am talking about Boris Yeltsin who for many years has been the
strongest critic and the strongest opponent of Mr Gorbachev

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#92:1:A>
But it was this critic and opponent who climbed on to the Russian
tanks condemned the coup and restored democracy to Russia not members of Mr
Gorbachev's own party

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#93:1:A>
The lesson for us is that you cannot place all your trust in one
man whether he is called Goh or Gorbachev

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#94:1:A>
If there is a one-party monopoly his own party might try to stab
him in the back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#95:1:A>
But if you have a parliamentary system with a strong and stable
opposition you can reduce the chances that hardline clique inside the ruling
party

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#96:1:A>
Whether it is the communist party or the PAP reduce the chances
that they have to overthrow the system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#97:1:A>
In other words if somebody powerful in the PAP intends to stab Mr
Goh in the back do you think there is any PAP back-bencher who has the
courage to stop the hand that's holding the knife

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#98:1:A>
These PAP back-benchers although they appear to speak up against
government sometimes always follow the party line when the party whip is
applied to them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#99:1:A>
Yes you think PAP MPs say amazing things yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#100:1:A>
Dr Arthur Beng said that the PAP needs the party whip otherwise it
might get toppled by its own back-benchers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#101:1:A>
Yah go read the Straits Times

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#102:1:A>
If there is so much chaos don't you think we have a right to know
whether there is so much chaos in the PAP that they might be toppled by their
own back-benchers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#103:1:A>
And who will find out what is going on except your opposition who
ask the embarrassing questions of the PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#104:1:A>
Are you having an internal power struggle to which they only reply
weak answers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#105:1:A>
And as Mr Chiam See Tong has said Mr Goh Chok Tong himself is not
above making foolish statements

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#106:1:A>
It was reported in today's papers saying that the opposition might
win all 40 contested seats and that this will mean that the PAP had no
mandate and that he would have to step down as Prime Minister in favour of
someone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#107:1:A>
Mr Goh has forgotten something

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#108:1:A>
Let me remind him of basic parliamentary factors in the unlikely
situation that Mr Ramasamy's Justice Party beats him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#109:1:A>
He won't even be an MP and do you know why Mr Goh Chok Tong forgot
that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#110:1:A>
Because he really doesn't believe that he is going to lose

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#111:1:A>
He really doesn't believe that the opposition might win 40 seats

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#112:1:A>
The reality is that we may that the PAP will win many of these 40
seats what

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#113:1:A>
The hope is is that the opposition can win some of them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#114:1:A>
This is what we are talking about the system in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#115:1:A>
We are lucky that we have a political system based on a tried and
tested model the British western system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#116:1:A>
The system that has been tested over hundreds of years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#117:1:A>
In Russia the old guards tried to introduce a new system based on
the dominance of one single party

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#118:1:A>
This party controls everything from trade union to public
transport and health

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#119:1:A>
It took them 70 years before they realise that the system did not
work and by then the damage was done here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#120:1:A>
In Singapore we do not have 70 years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#121:1:A>
One slip by the PAP we might be finished unless there is an
opposition to check the excesses of government <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-047#X122:1:A>
An opposition to speak up for all people whom the PAP does not
listen to an opposition to tell the government when and what it is doing
wrong and why and finally it is necessary an opposition to stand up in front
of tanks to stand up </X> </I>
