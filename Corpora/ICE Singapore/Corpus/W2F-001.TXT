<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#1:1>
Sui awoke when she heard King's crow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#2:1>
She ruffled her feathers to shake off the last bits of sleep, glanced
at Cheek's nest and tucked her head under her left wing, away from the early
morning insects, for that one last warm residual wink that she enjoyed the
most before another day in the kampung.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#3:1>
King crowed again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#4:1>
Such a majestic call!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#5:1>
" I am the King of the World!" he said with that Cock-coor-a-coorrrr!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#6:1>
" I am the King of the WORRRRLD!" It was a sound to awaken the world,
which slept when he slept and awoke when he called.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#7:1>
Sui could imagine him now, standing on the lip of the well, holding
firm on that slippery surface with the sure grip of his giant claws that
could easily rip the eyes out of his enemies, greeting as mighty a God as the
Sun with his own bright eye and loud, clear voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#8:1>
Cock-coor-a-coorrrr!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#9:1>
" I am the King of the WORRRRLD!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#10:1>
And he was also father to her children.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#11:1>
Father to the few who slept under her body for warmth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#12:1>
KIng was also the undisputed father to the children who were in her
body right now, whom she was due to release into the world, safe in their
protective shells, any day now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#13:1>
They would be, hopefully, what her elder sister Cheek called " those
with long memories".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#14:1>
Sui smiled under the warm darkness of her wing, remembering.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#15:1>
Cheek had once told Sui there were only two types of animals on the
farm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#16:1>
There were those with short memories and there were those with long
memories.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#17:1>
Those with short memories deserved no respect but they were happier.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#18:1>
They included most of the hens, all of the ducks, all three cows and
certainly all of the pigs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#19:1>
Those with long memories included Cheek herself, both the dogs and
some of the hens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#20:1>
" And which am I?" Sui had asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#21:1>
Cheek had laughed abundantly at that and said, " If you have to ask,
Sui, you are a Short Memory!" And Cheek had also said - Cheek...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#22:1>
Sui pulled her head sharply out from under her wing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#23:1>
The last bits of sleep fell off Sui like the fluff from the chicken
coop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#24:1>
She stared at Cheek's nest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#25:1>
Cheek was gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#26:1>
Oh no.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#27:1>
Sui shot up to look around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#28:1>
Her chicks started whining immediately as they always did at the
slightest thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#29:1>
" Cold!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#30:1>
Cold!" they cheeped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#31:1>
Sui sat down again quickly to keep them warm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#32:1>
Cheek was not in the shed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#33:1>
Where was Cheek?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#34:1>
Sui had a bad feeling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#35:1>
Yesterday, Cheek had been chased by the owner's children, until the
youngest boy had caught her roughly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#36:1>
Sui's heart fluttered with a damning fear at the remembrance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#37:1>
The young boy, scurvy in character and rude as his shorts, had held
Cheek upside down, her head hanging to the earth, her legs firmly in his
grip.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#38:1>
What had unnerved Sui was the lack of fight in Cheek after she was
caught.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#39:1>
She had seemed limp in spirit, a sight that had struck Sui with the
shock of the familiar turned strange.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#40:1>
Cheek, like King, had always meant strength to Sui.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#41:1>
She feared the worst.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#42:1>
There were malicious rumours about a disappearance of a hen long
before Sui had been born.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#43:1>
It was Cheek herself who had always cut short without ceremony
anybody she caught discussing these rumours and since there had not been a
disappearance of any hen since Sui had been born - only eggs - Su had
accepted Cheek's dismissal that they were only superstitious mutterings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#44:1>
And when Sui had asked why the owners collected the eggs, Cheek would
only say, " They have gone to a better place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#45:1>
" Sui knew better.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#46:1>
The owners frequently exchanged the eggs with other such owners from
other kampungs for sundry things.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#47:1>
No doubt the other owners had these eggs hatched to grow their own
chickens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#48:1>
Cheek had been returned to the coop yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#49:1>
Her humour had been brittle, but who would not be after such rough
handling?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#50:1>
" Nothing that matters!" Cheek had said when Sui asked what happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#51:1>
" Just a game," she said when Sui persisted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#52:1>
And now Cheek was gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#53:1>
If she was not here when Sui awoke, she could not be anywhere that
Sui knew.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#54:1>
Cheek never went anywhere without Sui.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#55:1>
They never breathed air further than sight of each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#56:1>
Then where was Cheek?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#57:1>
Sui began to feel faint.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#58:1>
Something horrible, something bad must have happened to her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#59:1>
" Children!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#60:1>
Stay!" she commanded as she hopped out of the nest, onto the muddy
floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#61:1>
She slipped, but found her feet and dashed out of the small chicken
shed, ignoring the loud, shrill cries of her chicks as they screamed, " Cold!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#62:1>
Cold!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#63:1>
Cold!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#64:1>
Sui ran straight to King, who still stood on the lip of the well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#65:1>
" Lord, Cheek is missing!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#66:1>
Cheek is missing!" KIng looked down at Sui with an imperious eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#67:1>
There was the familiar cock of the head and Sui waited for that
precious moment that King offered to the Wind God before he spoke.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#68:1>
" Cheek?" That was all he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#69:1>
Sui waited for more but there was no more coming.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#70:1>
" Lord, Cheek is missing!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#71:1>
You must do something!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#72:1>
She is gone!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#73:1>
Cheek is gone!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#74:1>
" Be QUIET!" Sui was shocked at the fierceness of his reply.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#75:1>
What had she done to deserve this?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#76:1>
Cheek was missing!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#77:1>
Didn't he want to know?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#78:1>
What was he going to do about it?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#79:1>
" Lord - " Sui began.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#80:1>
" I said BE QUIET!" Sui looked at him appalled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#81:1>
What was going on?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#82:1>
" Your children cry for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#83:1>
They are tearing their voices out of their lungs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#84:1>
Is your reply to cast them to the cold?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#85:1>
What must you do now?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#86:1>
What is it you must do?" Sui's eyes turned to iron weights, pulling
her head down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#87:1>
" I must return to my children."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#88:1>
" I will say no more."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#89:1>
Sui raised her eyes from the ground without any idea of how she dared
to do it and looked hard into King's eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#90:1>
They were as cold as the deep of the First Well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#91:1>
But there was something else in them too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#92:1>
Something she had never seen before and could not recognise.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#93:1>
It spurred a horrifying thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#94:1>
Had King something to do with Cheek's disappearance?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#95:1>
Was that it?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#96:1>
Had KIng done something to Cheek?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#97:1>
He had a temper like the roar of the earth-shaking machines that came
and went on the farm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#98:1>
Had he ripped her chest apart with those terrible claws for a word
spoken without care?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#99:1>
What had King done to Cheek?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#100:1>
What right had he to hurt her; she was so gentle that Sui's own
children called her Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#101:1>
Sui turned and took uncertain steps back towards the chicken shed,
her world suddenly just earth that was shifting under her feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#102:1>
Cheek gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#103:1>
And King had something to do with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#104:1>
Sui hated King that moment with a fury that made a mockery of all
her senses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#105:1>
She thought she would go mad.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#106:1>
" SUI!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#107:1>
She turned sharply.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#108:1>
It was King.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#109:1>
" Where are you going?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#110:1>
I said return to your children!" Sui realised then that she had been
wandering off on a confused tack.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#111:1>
Suddenly hot blood filled her head with a rage that was white light.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#112:1>
She screamed and ran towards King in a killing rage." All the noise
of the kampung stilled in shock and awe of that sight.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#113:1>
Sui, the loyal hen, was taking on KIng.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#114:1>
KIng jumped down from the rock and confronted Sui squarely as she
rushed blindly towards him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#115:1>
His feelings were mixed with compassion and an involuntary rage that
was swelling up within him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#116:1>
After all, a hen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#117:1>
How dare she act this way?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#118:1>
As she rushed up to him, he tensed his legs and lunged, checking her
with a body blow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#119:1>
Sui fell - flew - backwards from the impact and fell heavily on her
side, every bit of breath smashed out of her body.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#120:1>
King's blow had been harder and more brutal than he had intended.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#121:1>
He had lost control.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#122:1>
And that only made him angrier.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#123:1>
No matter what, she had no right to act this way!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#124:1>
No matter what, a hen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#125:1>
And she had made him lose control over himself in front of the
entire farm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#126:1>
IN FRONT of the ENTIRE farm!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#127:1>
KIng turned and strutted away abruptly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#128:1>
He walked past the perimeter of the farm and out of sight behind the
tobacco plot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#129:1>
Towards the other farmer's plot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#130:1>
Few dared to go in that direction.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#131:1>
Even King seldom did it without an audience.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#132:1>
Today he did it alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#133:1>
With KIng gone, the other hens came running to Sui, who still lay on
the ground in a daze, her feathers heavy with mud from the wet ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#134:1>
First to reach her was none other than Kai, who was the second wife
of King and the self-styled matriarch of the group after King's first wife
had been crushed into the ground by one of the earth-shaking machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#135:1>
It was said of Kai that she had a heart like clean water; it was
hard to find around here and held no harm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#136:1>
Without a word, Kai began nudging Sui back on her feet, using her
beak to push under Sui's heavy body, never mind the wet dirt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#137:1>
Sui got up unsteadily and found herself surrounded by nine clucking,
fat hens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#138:1>
Not all of them had run to help.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#139:1>
Two of them, their ample flesh quivering with delight at her
predicament, were already chiding her loud enough for the whole kampung to
hear.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#140:1>
" How can?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#141:1>
How can?" " A hen should know her place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#142:1>
You deserve what happened!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#143:1>
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner the way you behave!" " Too
much!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#144:1>
Too much!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#145:1>
How can?" " Stop it!" It was Kai who intervened, her beak still
covered with mud.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#146:1>
" The two of you just stop it right now!" The two hens sank into a
surly silence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#147:1>
They were senior hens and each had laid more eggs than Sui.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#148:1>
They considered it their right to chide her to their heart's
content.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#149:1>
Sui appreciated the support from Kai.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#150:1>
The ground was steady under her now and while she did not feel much
better, she could walk without help.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#151:1>
She started instinctively back towards her chicks in the shed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#152:1>
She hoped they had not seen this scene, and realised that she was
still covered with mud.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#153:1>
She changed direction abruptly and walked, still in a bit of a daze,
towards the pool, which was actually a small puddle full of tadpoles between
the well and the shed that collected leftover water splashed out of the well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#154:1>
Sui was cleaning herself there when she realised she was not alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#155:1>
It was Madog.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#156:1>
Madog was the female who belonged to Dog, who was the official
guardian in the kampung house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#157:1>
Sui had warm feelings for Madog, who had few friends because she was
so ugly, had a bad eye and teats that hung uselessly ever since her litter
had been taken away from her at their birth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#158:1>
Sui's heart lightened a little to see her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#159:1>
But Madog's face was hard to read.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#160:1>
Was Madog trying to show disapproval of what she had seen?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#161:1>
Sui became irritated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#162:1>
What was the use of Madog putting on such a show?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#163:1>
There was something terrible going on that mattered more than
anybody's feelings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#164:1>
Cheek was missing, maybe dead, or hurt and needing help, it was
horrible not to know...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#165:1>
Cheek was - " Sui, you must calm down," Madog said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#166:1>
Suddenly Sui saw that white light again that blinded everything.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#167:1>
She did try to calm herself if only so she could see Madog clearly
enough to assail her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#168:1>
" You!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#169:1>
What have you done to Cheek?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#170:1>
What have you done?" "

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#171:1>
Sui!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#172:1>
Calm yourself!" Even as Madog said it, she cast a worried look
towards her male partner on the porch of the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#173:1>
He had got up off his belly and was watching intently for any more
signs of trouble.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#174:1>
Dog - who was younger than Madog, lean, handsome and alert - had
been caught off guard by the little scene earlier, and he didn't intend to
let things get out of hand again. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X175:1>
Madog quickly set her tail wagging to reassure him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X176:1>
She talked to Sui as if in a light-hearted way to show that
everything was all right.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X177:1>
But the words that fell rapidly from Madog's mouth were anything
but frivolous.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X178:1>
" Sui, if you calm down enough to listen to me, I will tell you
everything, but first you must go behind the cow shed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X179:1>
Do you understand?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X180:1>
Sui, do you understand me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X181:1>
Sui, you must calm down!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X182:1>
You must.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-001#X183:1>
There is danger for you if you don't." </X> </I>
