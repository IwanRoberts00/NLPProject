<h> CONSERVATION PROPOSAL FOR PULAU UBIN </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#2:1>
by Lim Kim Keang

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#3:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#4:1>
With the increasing need for nature-oriented activities in an affluent
society and the world-wide trend in eco-tourism, there is a strong case for
maintaining Pulau Ubin as a nature reserve-cum-adventure island to complement
the intensive urbanised entertainment facilities provided on Sentosa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#5:1>
Pulau Ubin presents a unique opportunity to conserve the last
remaining large island with a diverse range of habitats, including natural
areas such as sandy and rocky shores, mangroves, estuaries and secondary
forests and man-made areas like fish and prawn ponds, farms, orchards,
abandoned quarries, disused farmland and plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#6:1>
It is the only remaining extensive rural landscape with residents
living in a kampong setting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#7:1>
Much of the island will continue to support the typical as well as the
endangered flora and fauna if sufficient safe-guards are implemented to
ensure that only appropriate developments and activities are permitted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#8:1>
There is much scope for creative management and usage of the abandoned
plantations and barren extents of land in the vicinity of disused quarries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#9:1>
It is of great importance therefore to have an overall plan for the
development of the island so that its intrinsic value can be retained and its
potential for nature and outdoor recreation can be optimally realised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#10:1>
<h> LOCATION AND EXTENT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#11:1>
Pulau Ubin is to the north-east of the main island of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#12:1>
It lies off the coast of Changi and is within the Straits of Johore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#13:1>
It extends from 1 deg 26' N 103&degree; 56'E to 1&degree
 24' N 103&degree 59.5'E and has
an area of 1019 hectares.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#14:1>
It i easily accessible from Changi Jetty by boat - - - the ride being
about 15 minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#15:1>
<h> General Description </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#16:1>
The island is elongated in shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#17:1>
It is generally hilly in the eastern and western zones and low and
swampy in the central zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#18:1>
The western zone remains undeveloped with prominent hilly features
such as Bukit Tajam ( 56m) and Bukit Tinggi ( 58m).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#19:1>
Most of the other hills of the island have been quarried or levelled.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#20:1>
The abandoned quarries have become stagnant deep pools, with some
quarry bottoms reaching well below sea level.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#21:1>
Quarrying operations are being phased out and only two belonging to
the Resources Development Corporation are currently still functioning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#22:1>
The central zone is dominated by a series of prawn and fish ponds
together with riverine and remnant mangroves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#23:1>
There are extensive abandoned plantations of rubber, coconut palms
and fruit trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#24:1>
Many of these areas are becoming scrubland and will eventually become
secondary forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#25:1>
The largest extent of sandy coast is in the east and south-east
shores.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#26:1>
Mangroves line the estauries and many of the tidal inlets as well as
some extent of the northern coastline.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#27:1>
The western zone has some natural steep slopes and rocky shores.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#28:1>
Few natural streams exist.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#29:1>
Besides the large bodies of fresh water found in the disused
quarries, there are very few shallow ponds.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#30:1>
The only reliable sources of water are wells.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#31:1>
Please see the Map attached.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#32:1>
<h> 1) WESTERN Zone </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#33:1>
This is an ornithologically important area as it is the major habitat
of the Red Jungle Fowl ( Gallus gallus), an endangered resident bird that
cannot be found anywhere else in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#34:1>
This is a colourful ancestor of the domestic fowl and is normally
found in jungles and adjoining areas away from human habitations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#35:1>
There are two main areas within this zone with significant wildlife.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#36:1>
Area A includes the two main forested hills on the island and Area B
is an interesting mangrove area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#37:1>
<h> Area A </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#38:1>
The only two significant forested hills provide the main habitat for
the Red Jungle Fowl.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#39:1>
Bukit Tajam is believed to hold up to 60 of these birds which is
perhaps the largest population of this endangered species in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#40:1>
Breeding records have been confirmed and these birds can be regularly
observed here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#41:1>
The coastal areas adjoining the northern slopes of Bukit Tajam are
important foraging grounds for this species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#42:1>
Another rarity that has been recorded here is the Ruby-cheeked
Sunbird ( Anthreptes singalensis) which is usually confined to less disturbed
lowland forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#43:1>
Bukit Tinggi has thickly forested slopes and a mature stand of
rattans at the base fringing the mangroves along Sungei Teris.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#44:1>
Such mature stands are rarely found elsewhere in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#45:1>
Besides supporting a viable population of Red Jungle Fowl, this area
may be an important foraging area for the Green Imperial Pigeon ( Ducula
aenea).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#46:1>
This is a large pigeon mainly encountered in coastal lowland forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#47:1>
The forests also support Abbott's Babblers ( Trichastoma abbotti) and
Magpie Robins ( Copsychus saularis).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#48:1>
The latter is highly vulnerable because of its popularity as a caged
bird.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#49:1>
The destruction of its habitats and trapping have practically brought
it close to extinction in other parts of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#50:1>
<h> Area B </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#51:1>
This is a major mangrove swamp, adjacent to the forested hills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#52:1>
About 16 hectares in extent, it is spread out on both banks of the
Sungei Assam and contains such mangrove plant species as Rhizophora apiculata
and Sonneratia alba.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#53:1>
The endangered Manrove Pitta ( Pitta megarhyncha), which is extinct
on Singapore Island, has been observed in this site.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#54:1>
This beautiful bird is now confined to Pulau Tekong and this island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#55:1>
Another endangered bird found here and also usually associated with
mangroves is the White-chested Babbler ( Trichastoma rostratum).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#56:1>
The largest kingfisher in Singapore, the Stork-billed Kingfisher (
Pelargopsis capensis) is also at home here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#57:1>
<h> Threats to the Western Zone </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#58:1>
The projected construction of the new Outward Bound School and other
expansion projects can pose serious threats to this major wildlife habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#59:1>
The encroachment into the foraging and breeding grounds during the
construction stage and subsequent intrusion when the ground-living Red Jungle
Fowl are raising chicks are likely to have serious consequences.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#60:1>
We are not against the construction of the new Outward Bound School.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#61:1>
Careful planning is required.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#62:1>
It is recommended that the expansion be limited to the existing open
ground, leaving the forested slope of Tajam intact as much as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#63:1>
The buildings should be inconspicuous and should harmonize with the
forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#64:1>
There is also a potential threat from the smallholders engaged in
fruit tree cultivation and vegetable farming expanding into the forests and
abandoned rubber plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#65:1>
Residents have also thinned out the forests here by cutting for
firewood and other purposes .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#66:1>
Hikers and mountain bikers too have intensified the thinning process
by indiscriminately bashing through the forest, instead of following existing
trails.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#67:1>
<h> 2) CENTRAL ZONE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#68:1>
The Central Zone has a diverse range of habitats including fruit
orchards, mangroves, abandoned rubber and coconut plantations, scrubland and
secondary forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#69:1>
The many fish and prawn ponds are prominent features of this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#70:1>
This diversity supports a large variety of animals typical of each
habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#71:1>
Many small mammals, reptiles and amphibians of open country habitat
and wooded areas are surviving well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#72:1>
Many of the common butterflies associated with the rural areas are
able to thrive here because of the variety of plants available.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#73:1>
There are five key areas in this zone that have significant
population of common as well as rare wildlife.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#74:1>
<h> Area C </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#75:1>
This area includes the former Kampong Noordin and has the only sandy
beach of recreational value on the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#76:1>
It is a popular picnic site for weekend visitors and a favoured
destination for campers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#77:1>
It contains the largest area of mangroves, about 195 hectares in
extent, spread mainly around Sungei Besar and Sungei Batu Kekek.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#78:1>
Although extensively exploited for fish farming and timber
extraction, large areas have been reclaimed by regenerating mangroves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#79:1>
Old mature stands contain mainly Rhizophora apiculata with some
Avicennia lanata, Avicennia officinalis and Bruguiera species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#80:1>
The regenerating mangrove is mostly made up of Lumnitzera and
Rhizophora apiculata.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#81:1>
Elevated mud-mount system built by the mud lobster, Thalassinia, is
much evident in the area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#82:1>
These extensive riverine mangroves constitute a major habitat for the
Copper-throated Sunbird ( Nectarinia calcostetha), a brilliantly coloured and
active bird that is often seen feeding amongst the flowers of the mangroves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#83:1>
This is another attractive mangrove species that is becoming
increasingly rare because of habitat destruction elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#84:1>
Another threatened bird is the Straw-headed Bulbul ( Pycnonotus
zeylanicus), the largest bulbul in South-east Asia, which has a viable
population at this site.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#85:1>
It is a species normally associated with coastal and riverine forest
( usually freshwater).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#86:1>
It does not seem to have any known breeding record outside Pulau
Ubin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#87:1>
The small extent of abandoned rubber plantation and fruit trees
appear to be suitable to the attractive Laced Woodpecker ( Picus vittatus),
another threatened species more common here than in the rest of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#88:1>
<h> Area D </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#89:1>
This area centres around the durian orchard and abandoned rambutan
plantation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#90:1>
An endangered small bird-of-prey, the Crested Goshawk ( Accipiter
trivirgatus) is a resident here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#91:1>
During the migrating season several migrant raptors roost here
including Chinese Goshawk ( Accipiter soloensis) and Black Baza ( Aviceda
leuphotes).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#92:1>
One of the prettiest birds in Singapore, the Common Goldenback (
Dinopium javanense), is commonly encountered here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#93:1>
Long-tailed Parakeets ( Psittacula longicauda) are frequent nesters
in holes of the older durian trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#94:1>
Bats including the Malayan Flying Fox are probably more abundant here
than other parts of the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#95:1>
Other mammals include the House Musang which is still holding out in
this area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#96:1>
Smaller mammals such as House Shrews can often be encountered in the
abandoned plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#97:1>
Reptiles such as the Garden and Sun Skink are also common.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#98:1>
The interesting Flying Lizard which feeds exclusively on ants
favoured the orchards and abandoned plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#99:1>
Monitor Lizards may be frequently observed in this area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#100:1>
<h> Area E </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#101:1>
This is an extensive area of prawn ponds with small stands of
mangroves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#102:1>
The bunds are important roosting sites for shorebirds during high
tides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#103:1>
A fair number of them are regularly observed, including Pacific
Golden Plover ( Plovialis fulva), Mongolian Plover ( Charadrius mongolus),
Common Redshank ( Tringa totanus), Common Greenshank ( Tringa nebularia) and
other migrant waders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#104:1>
During ebb tide, some of these birds will be joined by Little Egrets
( Egretta garzetta), Great Egret ( Egretta alba), Little Heron ( Butorides
striatus) and Pacific Reef Egret ( Egretta sacra) when feeding on the exposed
mudflats.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#105:1>
<h> Area F </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#106:1>
The abandoned rubber plantation of Sam Heng Estate is the only known
roost of the resident pair of Buffy Fish-Owl ( Ketupa ketupu) in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#107:1>
The birds feed in the nearby prawn ponds and rivers at night and
roost in the rubber trees during the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#108:1>
The riverine mangroves here also provide a habitat for the
Strawheaded Bulbul.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#109:1>
Two uncommon cuckoos, the Plaintive Cuckoo ( Cacomantis merulinus)
and Indonesian Cuckoo ( Cacomantis variolosus) have been observed here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#110:1>
<h> Area G </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#111:1>
This area includes the last remaining Malay kampong in Singapore,
Kampong Melayu.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#112:1>
The most important habitat is the nipah palm forest, a very rare
habitat that is almost completely gone from Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#113:1>
Together with the adjoining mangroves, it is a refuge for the
Ruby-cheeked Sunbird and another uncommon mangrove specialist, the Mangrove
Whistler ( Pachycephala cinerea).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#114:1>
The nearby ponds are believed to have one of the largest populations
of Pacific Reef Egrets in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#115:1>
This area has a small population of the White-rumped Munia (
Lonchura stirata), a rare species whose other known locaton is Pulau Tekong.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#116:1>
It haunts the grassy and shrubby patches.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#117:1>
<h> 3) EASTERN ZONE ( Area H) </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#118:1>
The Eastern Zone consists mainly of abandoned coconut and rubber
plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#119:1>
There is a record of a Buffy Fish owl in the rubber plantation
towards the eastern end.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#120:1>
This large zone requires further surveys to fully realise its
potential value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#121:1>
It can be expected to hold significant animal populations as it is
subjected to much less disturbances than the other areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#122:1>
There is a fair extent of mangroves with some nipah palms that is
frequented by a small troop of Long-tailed Macaques ( Macaca fascicularis).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#123:1>
The presence of nipah palms merits its conservation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#124:1>
This is an increasing rare type of coastal wetland habitat which is
has been cleared completely from most other areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#125:1>
- There is a mudflat on the north-eastern coast that attracts a
large number of migrant waders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#126:1>
There is also an extensive sandy beach of both coarse and fine
particles which is attractive to shorebirds.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#127:1>
The islet just off the north-eastern shore is known to be a nesting
ground for the Black-naped Tern ( Sterna sumatrana) and is highly vulnerable
to disturbance and predation by casual fishermen. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#X128:1>
This is only the second confirmed nesting site of this uncommon
resident tern.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#X129:1>
There are also unconfirmed reports of the Blue-winged and the
Mangrove Pitta, the latter a rare resident species, within this zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-029#X130:1>
A thorough survey will probably yield significant results. </X>
