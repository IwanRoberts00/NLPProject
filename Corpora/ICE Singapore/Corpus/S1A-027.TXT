that we've done or show some substitution <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#23:1:B>

After you go there you'll

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#104:1:A>
I will most probably

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#105:1:A>
Depending on what time because I think that doctor has a very long
lunch-break like from eleven to three or something like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#106:1:B>
Why don't you call him first before we go down

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#107:1:A>
No I'll check my card

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#108:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#114:1:A>

Okay then the ah never going to get my things done

<$B>

What things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#117:1:A>
Uh aiyah all my <unclear> word </unclear> fifteen minutes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#118:1:B>
The the the life scripts

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#119:1:A>
Beng Chiak is very upset just now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#120:1:B>
I don't blame her

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#121:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#122:1:A>
She was I've never seen her so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#123:1:A>
When she get upset uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#124:1:B>
She want to break down and cry right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#125:1:A>
If she get upset she'll like 'Yes you want talk to me'

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#126:1:B>
Ya uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#127:1:A>
No why I'm why I'm annoyed about is that when I spoke to
Enita

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#128:1:B>
Enita

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#129:1:A>
She said she doesn't want to do it so okay fine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#130:1:A>
Uhm she said then she said like actually Shoberth can do it but
it's just that they didn't communicate properly and all that with Beng Kiang
all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#131:1:A>
I said Whatever

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#132:1:A>
Then I said

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#133:1:A>
Then she explained

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#134:1:A>
I said No you don't have to explain

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#135:1:A>
I I'll just do it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#136:1:A>
She said Why are you not upset

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#137:1:A>
I said Well I'd rather not get emotional about these things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#138:1:A>
I I'll just be functional and and and detached and practical

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#139:1:A>
Then she said like Okay that's good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#140:1:A>
Then uhm she said Will you call Beng Kiang

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#141:1:A>
I said I will call Beng Kiang but not to tell her that you don't
want to do it but I think you should call her and tell her that you don't
want to do it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#142:1:A>
But I'll call Beng Kiang later and just talk about

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#143:1:A>
Okay so now what we do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#144:1:A>
But what I'm most annoyed about is that she called Beng Kiang and
she told Beng Kiang

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#145:1:B>
To call

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#146:1:A>
That I will talk to her you know and said Beng Kiang called
me <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#147:1:A>
Yes you want to talk to me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#148:1:A>
I said uhm Ya did Enita call you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#149:1:A>
Said she said Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#150:1:A>
Then I said uhm so did did she tell you she can't do it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#151:1:A>
She said Yes so you want to talk to me about what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#152:1:A>
You know like uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#153:1:A>
Ya I thought we know you'd better talk about what other
possibilites there are and all that kind of thing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#154:1:B>
No what what I was really annoyed with Enita was was okay she
she she blamed Beng Kiang for the Shobun thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#155:1:B>
You know what I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#156:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#157:1:B>
As in like it's it's uhm uhm they never communicate

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#158:1:B>
She never explain properly to her and now because at the end of
the day <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#159:1:B>
What it means is Enita cannot go on holiday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#160:1:B>
You know what I mean or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#161:1:B>
I can't help thinking that even if she's concerned about Shobun

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#162:1:B>
I can't help thinking that that that at the end of the day it's
because if or or it doesn't work out she cannot go on holiday

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#163:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#164:1:B>
You know is it and this is very irritating because it's irres

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#165:1:B>
I still feel it's irres(irresponsible)

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#166:1:B>
That's why she doesn't want to talk to me about it you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#167:1:B>
Because I told her yesterday I think you should do it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#168:1:A>
No but I don't want to be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#169:1:A>
I don't want to like tell people you must do you must not do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#170:1:A>
If you don't want to do don't do just say No or Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#171:1:A>
I don't want to even hear reasons because you are adult enough to
to to to go and rationalize this and you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#172:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#173:1:B>
No no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#174:1:B>
Because the thing is that why why I felt that uhm one of us had to
say it was because uhm on Beng Kiang's behalf you see because I think Beng
Kiang felt that it's it's very difficult

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#175:1:B>
Because Beng Kiang will feel that at the end of the day that we
didn't we didn't uhm tsk do anything about it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#176:1:A>
No but these things you just have to like live with it kind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#177:1:A>
I mean look at Those who can't teach wants his face pulled out
like two weeks before like what I mean you go to him and you say No you must
not leave that kind of thing <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#178:1:A>
I think you should stay and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#179:1:B>
No that's different you see but then you see that's different
because you you are involved in it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#180:1:B>
Alvin's involved in it and we explained blah blah blah blah right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#181:1:B>
The problem with this Beng Kiang thing is that it's Enita you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#182:1:B>
Enita is supposed to be one of us kind of thing and at and while
while we we receive <unclear> word </unclear> production support and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#183:1:B>
Then it's like Beng Kiang says ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#184:1:B>
Uhm you know she asked me that day Is is Enita always like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#185:1:B>
Does she do this very often

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#186:1:B>
I said No as far as I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#187:1:B>
I said she she does have some time constraints and stuff

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#188:1:B>
That's why in in reference to the group she's very clear about it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#189:1:B>
She she cannot come for this she cannot come for that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#190:1:B>
It's okay you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#191:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#192:1:B>
But she's clear from the onstart

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#193:1:B>
But I said I guess this is an unusual circumstance because she
also didn't expect to be here <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#194:1:B>
To be given the luxury of leave suddenly you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#195:1:B>
You know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#196:1:B>
But then it's like if we all if we if we don't say that uhm you
have a responsibility to do it then it's like we are being lax you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#197:1:B>
You know what I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#198:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#199:1:B>
And it's not as if we're offering a lot of of of uhm uhm
alternatives to Beng Kiang

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#200:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#201:1:B>
It's it's at this moment we're very stretched for <unclear>
word </unclear> as if we have <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#202:1:B>
And I told I told Enita there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#203:1:B>
And then I said I said I I have to admit

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#204:1:B>
My main priority at that point <unclear> word </unclear> one week
ago is is uhm Dawn

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#205:1:B>
Because Dawn hasn't even started you see and and the way Enita put
it is like Okay so the script is not written yet you know so it's alright if
I pull out

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#206:1:B>
It's not true you see and I I so I told Beng Kiang I know why
she's very panicky

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#207:1:B>
So I said let's

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#208:1:B>
I I told Beng Kiang that day in in the that uhm shop

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#209:1:B>
Even if it's not Enita if it's Shoberth whoever

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#210:1:B>
I said Your main priority now is to is to polish up the cast and
get the show on the road because she said Ya then the script <unclear> word
</unclear> in the script will be <unclear> word </unclear> and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#211:1:B>
I said But

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#212:1:B>
I said This is the is you know for the audience

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#213:1:B>
You you want the audience <unclear> word </unclear> to find out
whether it's going to be a good script or not right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#214:1:B>
So you must like you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#215:1:B>
You can't give <unclear> word </unclear> make house situation
<unclear> word </unclear> where everybody says Aiyah don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#216:1:B>
This part didn't work

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#217:1:B>
Don't know whether it's the cast the director or the or the script
kind of thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#218:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#219:1:B>
So I said if the direction is good and the the cast is good
then at least we can say Ah okay it's the script

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#220:1:B>
This is the problem where but that's constructive you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#221:1:B>
So ya lah that's why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#222:1:A>

is good and who can just can just do it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#223:1:B>

right now about this because it's like do we do we find someone for her or is
Shoberth doing it or what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-027#X228:1:A>
No she said she'll go and talk to Shoberth and Beng Kiang
Beng Kiang and if Shoberth can't do it then we'll find someone lah
