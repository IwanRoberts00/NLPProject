<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#1:1> <h> Introduction </h>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#2:1:A>
1 </&> At the Teachers' Day Rally last September Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong outlined the challenges to our education system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#3:1:A>
A key imperative was National Education

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#4:1:A>
Many Singaporeans especially pupils and younger Singaporeans knew
little of our recent history

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#5:1:A>
They did not know how we became an independent nation how we
triumphed against long odds or how today's peaceful and prosperous Singapore
came about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#6:1:A>
2 </&>  This ignorance will hinder our effort to develop a shared sense
of nationhood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#7:1:A>
We will not acquire the right instincts to bond together as one
nation or maintain the will to survive and prosper in an uncertain world For
Singapore to thrive beyond the founder generation we must systematically
transmit these instincts and attitudes to succeeding cohorts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#8:1:A>
Through National Education we must make these instincts and
attitudes part of the cultural DNA which makes us Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#9:1:A>
3 </&> The Prime Minister set up a committee chaired by Mr Lim Siong Guan
to study how to introduce National Education into our education system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#10:1:A>
The Committee has worked out a plan to do so

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#11:1:A>
To take the next step forward we need the full commitment of every
teacher and principal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#12:1:A>
National Education is not just a book subject

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#13:1:A>
It must appeal to both heart and mind

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#14:1:A>
Unless you are personally convinced of its importance committed to
the cause and have the knowledge and passion to teach National Education
competently and whole-heartedly the plan will fail

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#15:1:A>
<h> Lessons from Other Countries </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#16:1:A>
4 </&>  Singaporeans are not unique in needing National Education

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#17:1:A>
Other countries take National Education as a matter of course

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#18:1:A>
Japan is a tightly-knit cohesive and group-oriented society with a
long history and a strong sense of unique identity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#19:1:A>
Yet Japanese schools start early to teach pupils Japanese culture
values history and geography and even the politics and economics of Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#20:1:A>
As pupils get older they also learn about the cultures and
histories of other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#21:1:A>
In so doing they understand even better what makes them uniquely
Japanese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#22:1:A>
5 </&> Japanese schools go to great lengths to instill group instincts
and a sense that every student is an equal member of the group

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#23:1:A>
They have strict regulations on school uniforms school bags and
shoes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#24:1:A>
Students are grouped into teams called 'hans'

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#25:1:A>
Members of each han play together and eat together

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#26:1:A>
They take turns to perform specific responsibilities whether it is
the daily cleaning of school premises or serving lunch

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#27:1:A>
Academically stronger students are expected to help their weaker
friends

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#28:1:A>
Those who do not are ostracised

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#29:1:A>
Students organise the school sports day themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#30:1:A>
Competition is based mainly on team events there are few or no
individual events

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#31:1:A>
All students participate including those with disabilities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#32:1:A>
6 </&> Japanese schools do all this not because they believe that all
students are the same in every respect or have identical abilities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#33:1:A>
But they want every student to be equally valued as a member of the
group recognised for his strengths and for what he can contribute to the
group And so it goes for Japanese society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#34:1:A>
7 </&> In US schools every child is taught the American heritage George
Washington the Declaration of Independence the US Constitution the Civil War
and the Civil Rights movement

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#35:1:A>
Students take part in community service

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#36:1:A>
Learning to be a responsible citizen begins young

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#37:1:A>
It is a deliberate inculcating of American political and social
values and ideals to ensure the next generation grows up with these ideas
deeply ingrained

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#38:1:A>
It is a process of indoctrination like any other no less so because
the children are brought up to cherish American values of individual liberty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#39:1:A>
And it is so successful that many Americans are completely
convinced that American values are universal values of mankind

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#40:1:A>
8 </&> If countries like Japan and the US with long histories and deep
roots have found it essential to pass on national instincts systematically
from generation to generation all the more Singapore a young country barely
one generation old must make a concerted effort to imbue the right values and
instincts in the psyche of our young

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#41:1:A>
<h> Objectives Of National Education </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#42:1:A>
9 </&> National Education aims to develop national cohesion the instinct
for survival and confidence in our future

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#43:1:A>
We cannot offer our next generation any fixed formula for success
or even any set goals in life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#44:1:A>
They will face new circumstances and problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#45:1:A>
They will need to think through and work out their own solutions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#46:1:A>
But we must equip them with the basic attitudes values and
instincts which make them Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#47:1:A>
This is the common culture that will give them a shared perception
of life and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with
serious problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#48:1:A>
This will give them a well-founded faith in the country's future
This is the DNA to be passed from one generation to the next

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#49:1:A>
10 </&> There are four elements to achieving this objective

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#50:1:A>
11 </&> First we must foster in our young a sense of identity pride and
self-respect as Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#51:1:A>
This will strengthen their emotional attachment to the nation and
their sense of rootedness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#52:1:A>
We are proud of our country

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#53:1:A>
We are proud of what we have achieved together - our economic
progress our clean and green environment our open and clean system of
government our way of life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#54:1:A>
We are proud that each of us in his or her own way contributes to
Singapore's success

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#55:1:A>
12 </&> But success must not lead to hubris We must never be
over-bearing or arrogant or look down on people from other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#56:1:A>
We do not have all the answers for ourselves much less for other
countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#57:1:A>
But neither have we any reason to be ashamed to say I am a
Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#58:1:A>
In fact quite the contrary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#59:1:A>
13 </&> Second our young must know the Singapore Story how Singapore
succeeded against the odds to become a nation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#60:1:A>
National Education is not an abstract sermon on general principles
of nationhood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#61:1:A>
It is to do with a special story our story It is the story of
Singapore how we came to be one nation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#62:1:A>
We did not start off with this goal or even as one people Nobody
imagined this would be the outcome

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#63:1:A>
14 </&> As a British colony from 1942 to 1945 for 3 and frac12 years of
the Japanese Occupation we suffered a traumatic experience of cruelty
brutality hunger and deprivation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#64:1:A>
We lived through the post-war years of Communist-inspired unrest
and upheaval

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#65:1:A>
We then joined with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#66:1:A>
Despite pressure and intimidation we stood firm in Malaysia against
the communalists

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#67:1:A>
The issue was a fundamental one equal basic rights and
opportunities for all Malaysian citizens under the Malaysian Constitution and
no special rights for anyone in the State of Singapore on the basis of race
language and religion as was agreed in the State Constitution of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#68:1:A>
As a result we suddenly found ourselves out on our own as an
independent country with few means to make a living or defend ourselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#69:1:A>
Yet we developed our economy built up the SAF educated and housed
our people got them to work together and gradually became one nation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#70:1:A>
Year by year we transformed Singapore into what it is today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#71:1:A>
15 </&> Knowing this history is part of being a Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#72:1:A>
It is the back-drop which makes sense of our present

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#73:1:A>
It shows what external dangers to watch out for and where our
domestic fault lines lie

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#74:1:A>
It explains what we stand for and believe in and why we think and
act the way we do

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#75:1:A>
It gives us confidence that even when the odds look daunting with
determination and effort we will prevail

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#76:1:A>
16 </&> Thirdly our young must understand Singapore's unique challenges
constraints and vulnerabilities which make us different from other countries
Singapore is not as other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#77:1:A>
We will always be small we will always worry about our water supply
we will always have to work harder and do better than other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#78:1:A>
That is the hand which geography and history have dealt us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#79:1:A>
Overall it is not a bad hand nor have we played it badly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#80:1:A>
We have compensated for these constraints by being more resolute
and resourceful more efficient and productive and quicker and nimbler than
other countries which are better endowed and have larger margins for error

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#81:1:A>
And we have been so successful that sometimes we forget that the
underlying realities endure and have not gone away

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#82:1:A>
Singaporeans need to understand these realities to work together
and support the policies that are necessary to deal with them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#83:1:A>
17 </&> Knowing our constraints should make us more determined to
overcome them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#84:1:A>
It is no cause for despair We overcame more severe difficulties in
our first years of nationhood with far fewer resources and in more dire
circumstances

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#85:1:A>
We are much better placed to tackle them now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#86:1:A>
18 </&> Finally we must instill in our young the core values of our way
of life and the will to prevail that ensure our continued success and well
being

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#87:1:A>
Our core values include the system of meritocracy which guarantees
fair and full opportunities for all multi-racial and multi-religious harmony
and honest and competent government working for the long-term interests of
all Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#88:1:A>
We often take these for granted because things have been this way
in Singapore for a long time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#89:1:A>
But not new citizens who often come with fresh direct experience of
very different societies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#90:1:A>
Pupils must learn to treasure and uphold these social and political
values If we ever lose them Singapore will quickly become a very different
place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#91:1:A>
<h> Strategies </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#92:1:A>
19 </&> We need to develop national instincts among pupils at all levels

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#93:1:A>
National Education will begin in schools and continue in
post-secondary and tertiary institutions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#94:1:A>
After ten to fifteen years of education all students should know
the facts about Singapore and feel attached to Singapore their best home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#95:1:A>
Those likely to go on to play leadership roles later should at
least have had some preliminary preparation for their responsibilities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#96:1:A>
We will achieve this through both the formal and informal curricula

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#97:1:A>
<h> Formal Curriculum </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#98:1:A>
20 </&> We will introduce National Education content across the formal
curriculum

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#99:1:A>
We can do more of this in some subjects than others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#100:1:A>
The main subjects will be Social Studies and Civics and Moral
Education <&>  CME </&>  at the primary level History Geography and CME at secondary
level and the General Paper and CME at the Junior Colleges

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#101:1:A>
In addition Literature and the languages can also be used <h>
Subjects at Primary level </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#102:1:A>
21 </&>  In primary schools we will start teaching Social Studies
earlier beginning from Primary 1 instead of Primary 4 Social Studies will
complement Civics and Moral Education

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#103:1:A>
CME will emphasise teaching of values and correct individual
behaviour while Social Studies will give pupils an understanding of Singapore
society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#104:1:A>
22 </&> Pupils must start early to learn about the society around them
to feel a sense of belonging to family school and community to befriend and
accept pupils of all races and to develop a simple unabashed pride in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#105:1:A>
They recite the pledge sing Majullah Singapura and recognise our
flag Later they will learn the meaning of the crescent and five stars But
long before that when they see the helicopter flying past with the state flag
on National Day they should sense that it is a very special occasion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#106:1:A>
<h> Subjects at Secondary level </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#107:1:A>
23 </&> At secondary level students currently learn the history of our
independence period only in Secondary 1

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#108:1:A>
The 'O' level History syllabus stops in 1963 which perversely
omits the vital period leading to our independence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#109:1:A>
We will extend the 'O' level History syllabus for Singapore to
1971 The period of Merger Separation and the early years of independence will
also be taught in Secondary 2 instead of Secondary 1 so that the students
will be a little more mature and appreciate better what was at stake

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#110:1:A>
24 </&>  At the upper secondary level we will develop a new Social
Studies subject

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#111:1:A>
It will cover issues central to Singapore's survival and success
our principles of governance the strategies that have brought Singapore here
the role of key institutions like the SAF HDB CPF EDB and NTUC and our future
challenges <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-034#X112:1:A>
It will use examples from other countries to explain what works
and what fails and derive lessons for Singapore Subjects at the JC level 25
In the junior colleges students should start to learn what leadership
involves and to develop a commitment to serve society Through the General
Paper and Civics lessons they must acquire the sense that they can shape
their own future and more important that it is their responsibility to shape
Singapore's future They must be able to think independently and rationally
and reach informed conclusions about national issues 26 MOE will take 3-4
years to implement the new syllabi As the school curriculum is already heavy
we will make the changes without increasing the curriculum load We want the
new syllabi to give teachers more time not less to engage in creative ways to
bring issues to life for their students </X> </I>
