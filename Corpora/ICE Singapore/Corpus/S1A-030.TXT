<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#141:1:B>
Hours ago

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#142:1:A>
Hours ago

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#143:1:B>
Ya I wonder whether she's in the library or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#144:1:B>
Maybe I should give her a call

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#145:1:A>
What's she doing with your computer now Is she writing
anything

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#146:1:A>
Has she finished her story

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#147:1:B>
She has sort of finished but she hasn't revised it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#148:1:B>
So she has stored it in that diskette

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#149:1:A>
And she oh and the diskette

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#150:1:B>
She what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#151:1:B>
She what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#152:1:B>
No because she needed memory for her printer you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#153:1:B>
So she wiped off what's in the hard disk and stored inside the
diskette

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#154:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#155:1:B>
And then the printer needs more memory space now

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#156:1:B>
So I don't know what she's going to do

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#157:1:A>
Oh so the printer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#158:1:B>
takes up some memory space you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#159:1:A>
So why doesn't she get a printer that doesn't take up so much
space

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#160:1:B>
I think basically printers do

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#161:1:A>
Oh so it was no good to use a lap to buy a laptop right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#162:1:B>
I think a laptop is not powerful enough

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#163:1:B>
When she needs an interface I don't know what an interface is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#164:1:A>
Oh an interface I think it bridges two different systems is
it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#165:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#321:1:B>
I think we shall make a move </I>


<I>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#322:2:C>
Uh Muslim laws lah which means that uhm for example uhm
anyone is caught drinking <unclear> word </unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#323:2:D>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#324:2:C>
He could be could be uh uh what you caned

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#325:2:D>
Hor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#326:2:D>
They're going to make it state law is it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#327:2:C>
Ya they're going to make it state law applicable <unclear>
word </unclear> to non Muslims

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#328:2:C>
And uhm uh things like a thief or a robber would be uh amputated
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#329:2:D>
I suppose it's alright lah if they apply I mean to

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#330:2:C>
But they want to they want to apply to non-Muslims as well
unless unless non-Muslims have their own uh

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#331:2:D>
Laws which <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#332:2:C>
They have own laws ya which are which would prescribe
punishment

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#333:2:D>
Ya but how about the present laws

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#334:2:C>
The present laws are not the

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#335:2:D>
they are not enough

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#336:2:C>
Are not uh uhm implemented by religious groups implemented by
the state

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#337:2:D>
Ya but why must they be implemented by religious groups
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#338:2:D>
People who are not part of the religion

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#339:2:C>
Well that's part of the discussion now lah whether it should
include Muslims or non-Muslims and uh <unclear> word </unclear> <X>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X340:2:D>
Ya but then it starts there you know Very likely I mean if
it succeeds there you know Very likely it will

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X341:2:C>
Ya ya national government <unclear> word </unclear> At first
nation did say that it will not support uh such course 'cos Malaysia is a
multi-racial multi-religious secular state but later it uh changed its its
opinion at least in the reverse and said that it would conditionally support
the people as long as you apply to Muslims

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X342:2:D>
I think that's fair I mean I mean <unclear> word </unclear>
Muslims I mean it's fair what for for Muslims to have Muslim laws

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X343:2:C>
But <unclear> word </unclear> wants it to apply to Ah but
there are some groups that actually not not all you know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X344:2:D>
Like who <unclear> word </unclear> Muslims

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X345:2:C>
No no not not so much <unclear> word </unclear> Islam other
uh Muslim groups but

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X346:2:D>
Ya but they are Muslim groups right <unclear> word
</unclear> some of them will say that other people should suf I mean of
course I mean of course if they <unclear> word </unclear> themselves they
suffer most of it lah which like me uh <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-030#X347:2:C>
