<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#1:1>
<h> FORGING NATURE'S SWORD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#2:1>
FIRE engulfed the village of jodar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#3:1>
Bloody red flames lashed out at the dark sky like cobras striking out
at innocent souls to inflict upon them death.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#4:1>
Streaks of red coloured the sky, sword wounds flowing blood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#5:1>
Ashes rained from the sky, partially hidden by the wafts of smoke
rising rapidly from the eastern end of the village.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#6:1>
Complacent people cupped their hands together, trying to save the
ashes, thinking that by doing so they could save a soul.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#7:1>
But, they couldn't.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#8:1>
At the entrance of the village stood Blanchkar, the leader of the
Sorcerers, the King of Fort Magar, and the avenging bandit of Khalabar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#9:1>
" I will teach the people of khalabar who banished us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#10:1>
I'll show them the power of the Black Arts and destroy every single
village of their land.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#11:1>
King Zandal, the fool!" Blanchkar vowed aloud, his fists clenched and
his eyes shone with revenge.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#12:1>
At this, his men chanted: " Down with Zandal!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#13:1>
Long live King Blanchkar!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#14:1>
Long live the Black Arts!" The crimson sun hovered over the crest of
the hill, its light driving away the dark of night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#15:1>
A warm breeze dispersed the mist which blanketed the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#16:1>
Dew drops set on the plants reflecting the sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#17:1>
From afar, the fields seemed to be a sea of diamonds.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#18:1>
The plants were obviously precious to the people of Aztam Village,
like diamonds, for no sooner had mist dispersed, people were trudging into
the fields to tend to the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#19:1>
They needed these plants for survival.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#20:1>
Only they gave them life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#21:1>
For this reason, the plants were known as Life Plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#22:1>
" Careful with that plant, young man," Joam, the Chief Tender, called
out to a young man working at the edge of the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#23:1>
" The name's Lightor, Sir!" the lad replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#24:1>
" I think something's wrong with this plant."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#25:1>
Joam frowned as he walked over, gesturing Lightor to stand aside and
squatting down to have a closer look at the Life Plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#26:1>
" Hmm... purple spots all over," he muttered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#27:1>
" can it be - "

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#28:1>
" Sir," Lightor cut in suddenly, his black eyes bursting with
excitement.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#29:1>
" The plants are supposed to be green with big healthy leaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#30:1>
This one has purple spots and, and the leaves are - "

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#31:1>
" Getting smaller," Joam complete the sentence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#32:1>
He knitted his bushy eyebrows together and stared at Lightor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#33:1>
" next time, don't break my thoughts.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#34:1>
You understand?" Lightor puffed up his red cheeks and looked down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#35:1>
" I'm sorry, Sir.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#36:1>
I got carried away." Joam patted Lightor's shoulder and smiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#37:1>
" Run along now, and don't ever cross over the edge of the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#38:1>
Beware of the creatures of the Great Forest." Lightor's childish face
lighted up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#39:1>
" Yes, Sir!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#40:1>
The village of Aztam was surrounded by the Great Forest, rumoured to
be inhabited by the evil creatures created by practitioners of the Black
Arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#41:1>
But, no one had ever seen any of those creatures, nor did anyone wish
to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#42:1>
Since the ancient war between the Sorcerers and the Naturalists, the
land of Khalabar had been thrown into chaos.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#43:1>
The Sorcerers who believed in magic as a way of life, lost in the
vital battle of Zurax and were banished forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#44:1>
Hence, the Naturalists who advocated living with and improving on
what Nature provided ruled this land.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#45:1>
The afternoon sun scorched the fields where the villagers settled
down to have lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#46:1>
Plucking a leaf carefully, Lightor brought it to his mouth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#47:1>
" Hmm...delicious," he muttered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#48:1>
" Two more to go."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#49:1>
Just as he was going to pluck the next leaf, he felt a pat on his
shoulder.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#50:1>
He turned around to see his friend, Fatsot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#51:1>
" Hi, Lightor," Fatsot said, grinning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#52:1>
" Mind if I eat one of your leaves."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#53:1>
" Yes, I do.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#54:1>
You are fat enough as it is.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#55:1>
And, don't you ever forget the three for one rule.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#56:1>
One person, three leaves for all meals."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#57:1>
" Sure, I remember," Fatsot said as he patted his bulging belly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#58:1>
" I even know the story behind it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#59:1>
And, I'll tell you if you'll let me have one of your leaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#60:1>
Well?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#61:1>
At this, Lightor smiled a half smile, his eyes brightening up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#62:1>
He was always a sucker for stories, especially weird ones.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#63:1>
" Okay, tell me."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#64:1>
" A long time ago, there was this great eater in the village, see.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#65:1>
He ate a lot of leaves and almost caused a famine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#66:1>
So, to stop the tragedy from happening again, the rule was imposed."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#67:1>
" And, what happened to that guy?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#68:1>
" Well, he ate so much that he burst just like that." Fatsot snapped
his fingers to emphasize the burst.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#69:1>
" Interesting," Lightor said as he plucked two more leaves from the
plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#70:1>
" But, I'm too old to believe you."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#71:1>
So saying, he pushed the leaves into his mouth and munched away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#72:1>
" Hey!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#73:1>
You cheated!" Fatsot's face burnt with anger.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#74:1>
" You, wild child of the orphanage!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#75:1>
Lucky for you, your parents died early, or I'll tell on you!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#76:1>
" Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#77:1>
Catch me if you can!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#78:1>
Fatsot lunged at Lightor, his chubby arms poised to squeeze every
blood out of him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#79:1>
Lightor side-stepped and jabbed him in the stomach.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#80:1>
Fatsot groaned in pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#81:1>
" Now, I'll show you how I lift a five hundred-pound fool!" Lightor
grabbed Fatsot by the waist and swung him over his head.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#82:1>
At sixteen, Lightor was as strong as any King's knight, if not
stronger.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#83:1>
" Help!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#84:1>
Oh, help!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#85:1>
Lightor looked up at the sagging bottom of Fatsot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#86:1>
No, it was not from him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#87:1>
A scan at the fields edge revealed two men in rags running away from
a manlike creature which towered eight feet tall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#88:1>
Just a dozen paces away from the edge, Lightor ran with Fatsot over
his head towards the two men.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#89:1>
" Hey, Lightor!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#90:1>
Are you crazy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#91:1>
The thing'll crush the two of us!" Fatsot's voice was almost
hysterical.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#92:1>
" Not if you crush him first, buddy boy!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#93:1>
With the two men safely behind Lightor, the creature was only a few
paces away from him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#94:1>
Its eyes shone in a fiery red aura.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#95:1>
" Okay, Fatsot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#96:1>
Close your eyes and think that you're landing on lots of leaves."
Lightor breathed in deeply and with a war cry, slammed Fatsot at the
creature.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#97:1>
Fatsot landed on the creature with a boom which reverberated across
the village.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#98:1>
The creature roared in pain and vanished.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#99:1>
" Oh, thank you!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#100:1>
Thank you!" the shorter of the two men hugged Lightor in gratitude.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#101:1>
" I'm Dirkoff and this is Grougar."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#102:1>
The man called Grougar bowed slightly, his right hand over his chest
and his eyes always on Lightor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#103:1>
" Pleased to meet you."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#104:1>
By now, a big crowd had gathered at the edge of the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#105:1>
A short man with partially bald head came forward with Joam by his
side.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#106:1>
" I'm the Village Head," he introduced himself to the two men.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#107:1>
" My name's Dave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#108:1>
What happened?" " We are from the village of Jodar," Grougar began,
his wolflike eyes blinking as a wind blew across the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#109:1>
" The Sorcerers had attacked our village.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#110:1>
We were fortunate enough to escape the massacre as we were out
fishing then.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#111:1>
And - "

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#112:1>
" Fishing?" Lightor eyed Grougar curiously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#113:1>
" Oh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#114:1>
A rod and a line inside water with a bait and wait for a fish to
bite," Dirkoff explained eagerly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#115:1>
" A fish is an animal that lives in water."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#116:1>
" Oh?" Lightor sounded surprised.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#117:1>
" How come we've never heard of fishing here?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#118:1>
" It's because all of you live in the inner land.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#119:1>
In the outer land, you'll see lakes and ponds teeming with ashes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#120:1>
And, lakes and ponds contain - " " Water." Lightor smiled smugly,
glad that he knew the answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#121:1>
" Hold it, Lightor." Joam stared at him, causing his stomach to
knot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#122:1>
" Let him finish his story."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#123:1>
" Knowing that your village is the nearest," Grougar continued, " we
ran into the Great Forest and made our way here.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#124:1>
At the edge, that troll confronted us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#125:1>
Fortunately, Brother Lightor and the fat guy saved us."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#126:1>
" What fat guy?' Fatsot growled as he limped towards Grougar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#127:1>
" My name's Fatsot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#128:1>
And, where's that wild child?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#129:1>
" Right here, buddy boy," Lightor said, half grinning, half
giggling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#130:1>
Just as Fatsot stumbled towards Lightor for another fight, Joam
stopped him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#131:1>
" Here are five leaves as a reward for driving the creature away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#132:1>
Shake hand with Lightor and I'll let you eat them."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#133:1>
Fatsot smiled and shook Lightor's hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#134:1>
" Friends?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#135:1>
" Friends."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#136:1>
" Leaves?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#137:1>
You all eat leaves?" Dirkoff asked, his round eyes wide opened.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#138:1>
" Yes," Joam replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#139:1>
" We eat the leaves from these Life Plants for survival."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#140:1>
" Strange.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#141:1>
From where I come from, we eat grass.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#142:1>
We call them Strength Grass." Dave smiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#143:1>
" That's why we are the Naturalists.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#144:1>
We are adapted to Nature's way of life." At the mention of 'Naturalists',
Grougar's eyes narrowed with an evil glint.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#145:1>
Lightor noticed that but dismissed it as an action to keep out the
dust which was rifting in with the breeze.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#146:1>
Night reigned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#147:1>
Shadows danced in the fields under the pale moonlight as a warm
breeze brought in the mist.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#148:1>
The Field Guards with their shiny spears were pacing the fields,
their eyes alert for any intruder.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#149:1>
The spears were obtained from the village of Kenk in past barter
trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#150:1>
In times of peace, trade among Naturalist villages were carried out
most earnestly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#151:1>
They exchanged their products with one another and shared among
themselves the skills of forging, mining, farming, sewing, building, carving
and many other useful skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#152:1>
With the outbreak of The War, every village had stopped trading and
concentrated only on its very own survival.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#153:1>
" Say, buddy boy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#154:1>
There's a cricket to your right,"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#155:1>
Lightor whispered, bringing a candle towards that spot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#156:1>
" Where?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#157:1>
I don't see any."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#158:1>
" Sh...Don't let the Field Guards hear you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#159:1>
Or, we'll be forced to eat crickets."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#160:1>
" I know, I know," Fatsot said impatiently.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#161:1>
" Where the hell is the cricket?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#162:1>
" It's gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#163:1>
Let's search at the edge of the fields.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#164:1>
I heard that the crickets there are great fighters."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#165:1>
The duo inched towards the edge of the fields, making sure to keep
their heads lower than the four feet tall plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#166:1>
The squeegee mud squished and squashed under Fatsot's heavy limbs,
leaving a flat trail behind for Lightor to follow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#167:1>
" Go a bit faster, buddy boy."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#168:1>
" Wait.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#169:1>
Sh..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#170:1>
" What?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#171:1>
" Do you hear it?" There was a tinge of fear in Fatsot's voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#172:1>
" Hear what?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#173:1>
" A sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#174:1>
Something like fire burning."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#175:1>
Lightor twitched his ears, trying to locate the source of the sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#176:1>
" It's a dozen paces to our right.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#177:1>
Let's take a look."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#178:1>
Lightor and Fatsot peeked out from behind the plants like a pair of
prairie dogs scanning their surrounding from their mounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#179:1>
Behind the curtain of mist, they saw something that caused a shiver
to surge through their very being.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#180:1>
A hooded figure hovered over a Field Guard, lightning bolts slammed
into the guard, turning him into ash.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#181:1>
" It's, it's a Sorcerer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#182:1>
Oh, my..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#183:1>
" Quiet, Fatsot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#184:1>
We've to inform the rest."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#185:1>
" Eh, Lightor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#186:1>
I'm going to, to..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#187:1>
" Belch?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#188:1>
Quick, cover your mouth."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#189:1>
" Sneeze too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#190:1>
A-tishoo!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#191:1>
Lightor looked at Fatsot in horror, his eyes raging with fear.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#192:1>
The image of death flashed through his mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#193:1>
He had seen his parents die at the hands of the Sorcerers, and he
was not going to die like that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#194:1>
He clenched his fists and sank his teeth into his lower lip.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#195:1>
For a moment, time froze.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#196:1>
" Run for it!" Lightor shouted at the top of his voice and pulled
Fatsot with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#197:1>
The duo sped towards the village, their legs pounding the ground as
fast as they could.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#198:1>
The Sorcerer took to the air and gave chase.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#199:1>
" What the...We're running to the edge," Lightor panted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#200:1>
" Turn right to the village."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#201:1>
Lightor could feel his blood surging to his fast pumping heart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#202:1>
The fear in his mind was no longer present, only the goal of
reaching the village stood in his mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#203:1>
A sudden explosion of hot air behind the duo sent them sprawling
onto the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#204:1>
Lightor shook his head violently and looked at the village.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#205:1>
It was gone!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#206:1>
" Well," a witchlike voice cackled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#207:1>
" How do you like my illusion, Naturalists?" <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#X208:1>
" Damn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#X209:1>
I should have known."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#X210:1>
Lightor punched the ground with his fist.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#X211:1>
" I warn you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-015#X212:1>
You better stay away from us." </X> </I>
