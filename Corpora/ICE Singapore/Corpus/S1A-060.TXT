<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#1:1:A>
I think at present the subject I like most is uh I think EL 407

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#2:1:B>
407

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#3:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#4:1:A>
It's uhm I mean it's education and something that I find to be very
practical especially for next line because I'm thinking to going to teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#5:1:A>
And I don't know I mean I I like the lecturer's style of teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#6:1:A>
His his firstly he speaks quite he's able uh I'm able to follow it
systematically and I'm I'm able to you know take down notes easily easily
also

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#7:1:A>
I mean and uh I don't know why I mean he is quite interesting in a
way also and I can I'm able to grasp the concept

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#8:1:A>
I'm okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#9:1:A>
What about yourself I mean what do you like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#10:1:B>
For me I like I like models best

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#11:1:B>
402 because I I think it's very interesting because there's there's
three different theories and basically we sort of put into practice what we
have for the past three years which is grammatically analysis

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#12:1:B>
And it's more in depth sort of analysis so to do that what what
I've learnt for three years is more worthwhile in doing that course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#13:1:B>
And personally I like narrative structures

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#14:1:B>
I think that's very interesting uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#15:1:A>
I was I was a little bit worried about narrative structure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#16:1:A>
I mean am I uhm am I how should I say

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#17:1:A>
Something like uhm okay so far what I've done in a in the narrative
structure lectures right I think sort of anything from 305 because I never
been taken 305 so my worry is there you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#18:1:B>
I guess at at the moment we we haven't done anything on 305

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#19:1:B>
Uh but basically a very I think it's a very subjective course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#20:1:B>
So whatever your point of view whatever you feel as long as you can
justify you should get be able to get a good grade

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#21:1:B>
What do you feel about uh I mean Lexicology and Semantics

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#22:1:A>
I don't quite like Semantics and Lexicology for one point
because the lecturer seems to seem the lecturer seems to be very uhm
disorganised

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#23:1:A>
And uh I mean I don't know it's like okay like for example
Semantics uhm it's like as if it's not really prepared you see so and so
because of that it's not very structured

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#24:1:A>
Anything can be discussed during the seminar so I'm not very used
to such lecturer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#25:1:A>
Basically I'll be I'm quite at a loss as to what is important and
what is not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#26:1:A>
And uh for Lexicography it's the same thing ya because it's very
funny to go into a lecture to a seminar and then come out and and have this
uhm sense that maybe I I mean come out with little so I don't know if that's
the essence of it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#27:1:A>
I mean uhm he spoke a lot you see but then the lesson seems to be
very little so I don't know if that's what it is uh whether those are the
main point or whether I've lost a lot of thing you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#28:1:B>
That's about how I feel

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#29:1:B>
I basically I feel that Lexicology is just you and there there will
not be much knowledge being past and a lot of practice and a lot of skill

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#30:1:B>
And because it depends on intuition I I think that some people will
do better regardless whether they read more or less than other people

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#31:1:A>
I've not very good intuitions

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#32:1:B>
I mean certain things I just don't see the way the lecturer
sees

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#33:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#34:1:A>
Do you watch uh anyway do you watch watch It

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#35:1:A>
I mean the show It

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#36:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#37:1:A>
Oh you didn't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#38:1:A>
Oh I mean you watch TV <unclear> word </unclear> ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#39:1:A>
Do you watch TV I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#40:1:B>
Sometimes I I mainly watch I like to watch Laser Disc

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#41:1:A>
Laser Disc

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#42:1:A>
Oh you have Laser Disc

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#43:1:B>
Yes so we we me and wife we always borrow things that both of
us are interested in

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#44:1:B>
Usually the TV has things that one of us

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#45:1:A>
Oh so what what do you usually do you watch I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#46:1:B>
Shows like My Fair Lady The Sound of Music

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#47:1:B>
On Laser Disc it's very clear

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#48:1:A>
How much is it a text

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#49:1:B>
I mean to you mean a recorder or the renting

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#50:1:A>
You mean you got a recorder

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#51:1:B>
You need a recorder

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#52:1:A>
You have a recorder

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#53:1:B>
I don't I'm using my <unclear> word </unclear> when I stay at
my friend's house so I'm using his recorder

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#54:1:A>
How much is the disc I mean the rental

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#55:1:B>
Rental is very cheap

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#56:1:B>
Normal video tapes about four to five dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#57:1:B>
Laser Disc cost about four dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#58:1:B>
Can if you rent three discs and above you can have it for one week
and and the thing is it's good as you can just search the part that you want
to see because the whole story is broken up into a few segments

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#59:1:B>
And for certain Laser Disc for Draculla and and you can choose the
ending that you want

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#60:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#61:1:B>
So they will they will actually this side b at the end right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#62:1:B>
They will have ending A ending B and you select your own

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#63:1:A>
Oh that means ah the the show is then you mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#64:1:B>
What

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#65:1:A>
I mean you mean the Dracula as in Best of the Dracula

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#66:1:B>
Ah the recent one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#67:1:A>
There are three different endings

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#68:1:B>
Yes because they sometimes the director takes a few cuts

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#69:1:B>
Then he he picks the best one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#70:1:B>
He goes according to audience's liking

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#71:1:A>
Oh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#72:1:B>
So you get to play director sometimes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#73:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#74:1:B>
So it's very fun know you know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#75:1:B>
You choose no shiok then you just change

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#76:1:A>
So what you I mean can you can only change the ending

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#77:1:A>
Can you change anything else

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#78:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#79:1:A>
No only the ending

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#80:1:B>
I mean main things are there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#81:1:B>
Sometime they give you a a a a lot of extra footages like N Gs uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#82:1:A>
What's N Gs

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#83:1:B>
N g is like not good scenes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#84:1:B>
So when the uh actors laugh or they forgot their lines

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#85:1:A>
Oh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#86:1:B>
Or when their room drops down

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#87:1:A>
Oh the telephone

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#88:1:B>
I think ignore it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#89:1:A>
I think we should ya I think so lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#90:1:B>
I mean anyway it's not our room

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#91:1:A>
It's not our room

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#92:1:B>
Actually it's quite a good investment your family can see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#93:1:A>
My mom actually thought about that thing sort of a setting up
a home theatre

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#94:1:A>
Ya but then uhm we're thinking that it's no point because we live
in a three-room flat

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#95:1:A>
Whatever we do I mean you know you you need a very big house to
have something like that a special room for this and then otherwise it will
be it sorts of defeat the purpose because also you get karaoke and all that
right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#96:1:B>
Ya actually it doesn't know because a simple set cost about
two three two to three thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#97:1:B>
I mean about thousand over a TV thousand over for a Laser Disc and
I I find that's the one that my friend has

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#98:1:A>
Why why you have you already have a TV must you get another I
mean a new TV

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#99:1:B>
Uh you you need not have to if your TV is what they good
enough or functional enough because Laser Disc offer a lot of uh options like
surround sound stereophonic sound effect

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#100:1:A>
Oh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#101:1:B>
If you don't have a good TV with very good speakers the joy
is like half gone

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#102:1:B>
You get very clear image but not not clear sound

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#103:1:A>
Oh I see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#104:1:A>
Yes well don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#105:1:A>
I mean anyway the money has gotten into making cabinets room
cabinets

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#106:1:B>
Actually that's more functional

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#107:1:A>
Ya well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#108:1:B>
So will you be attending the talk this uh coming Tuesday

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#109:1:A>
Ya I will be I mean the ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#110:1:A>
I mean I was looking through

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#111:1:B>
It seems that they they place a lot of emphasis on the
teaching

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#112:1:A>
Ya actually it's quite a fix of set compared to the other one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#113:1:A>
The other one is more demanding in terms of its direction

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#114:1:A>
Uh but the teaching one is more demanding in the actual course

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#115:1:B>
It seems that you fail the teaching you fail the whole course

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#116:1:A>
Ya and the the worry is that I mean you got to go and you got
for practical uhm experience right you got to go and teach in the primary
schools or secondary schools in England

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#117:1:A>
That was uhm this sorts of you know like make make me makes me
wonder uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#118:1:A>
I mean when you teach the school in England then how I mean like
our English is not their their English ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#119:1:A>
I mean will they be able to accept

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#120:1:A>
Most probably not and then how when it comes to such things

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#121:1:B>
But will will that deter you from applying

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#122:1:A>
I think I'll just go and try and not think too much about it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#123:1:B>
Ya ya that's <unclear> word </unclear> that's how I'm going
to do too

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#124:1:A>
I guess just to leave at least leave the options open you
know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#125:1:B>
But do you think it'll be more recognised if you come back as
overseas scholar

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#126:1:A>
That's what I thought yep see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#127:1:A>
Ya and I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#128:1:B>
Should be right logically

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#129:1:A>
There's always been my dream to go to another country whether
I'm going before to just study not for uh you know like a major course but
just for a year course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#130:1:A>
Just see what's it's all about especially and what's like to study
abroad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#131:1:B>
So would you like to teach in a secondary or JC

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#132:1:A>
I think I'll like to teach in secondary

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#133:1:A>
Uhm firstly it's because you know like during college time I find
that the principals are quite idiosyncratic and very very demanding because
of the A level you see and there are not many junior college here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#134:1:A>
And then uhm I find that teaching in a secondary school might be
more personal

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#135:1:A>
You can do it at a more personal level and uh don't know I'm
finding I don't know I think I prefer to teach at N level than at JC

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#136:1:B>
Will you prefer an all guys school

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#137:1:A>
Uhm ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#138:1:B>
An any reasons

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#139:1:A>
Any reasons ha

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#140:1:A>
I don't know either that or or or co-ed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#141:1:A>
Uhm better not all girl school especially the girls will bully the
guys

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#142:1:A>
Are you still are you thinking of teaching I mean at all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#143:1:B>
I I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#144:1:B>
I'm I'm more thinking of a more stable job

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#145:1:A>
Teaching is not stable

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#146:1:B>
Actually I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#147:1:B>
I may leave because of my this idiosyncrasies

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#148:1:B>
I don't think I can

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#149:1:B>
I mean put in a gross gross way endure thirty years of teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#150:1:B>
Personally I I would like the job where I I could climb I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#151:1:B>
And teaching even though you can climb I guess takes many years
ten years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#152:1:A>
It's more uh like something you love to do forever

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#153:1:B>
Rather than be ambitious and <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#154:1:A>
It's different

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#155:1:A>
I guess it's like how what you want to do but teaching is like a
vocation

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#156:1:B>
I was thinking of the Police Force

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#157:1:A>
Police Force

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#158:1:B>
But my wife is against it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#159:1:A>
Because it's quite dangerous right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#160:1:A>
I think it's more dangerous than the army

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#161:1:A>
I find that uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#162:1:B>
War is less real

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#163:1:A>
Ya and you don't do that much because of you know like
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#164:1:A>
Police is like really you know what I mean you are really in fore
front

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#165:1:B>
Or another thing would be I hope to go and study some more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#166:1:B>
Probably come back and teach in a higher higher institution

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#167:1:B>
But that doesn't seem very likely

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#168:1:A>
Oh then you'll never know right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#169:1:B>
Doctor Peter Ong

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#170:1:B>
But even though you have have the money you even though you have
the qualifications you may not have the money

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#171:1:B>
Get good results and may not have money to go

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#172:1:A>
But some of them like that means let's say you do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#173:1:A>
Okay let's say you get a very good honours that means you will
continue with the masters

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#174:1:B>
I would rather go abroad

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#175:1:A>
Abroad

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#176:1:A>
It all depends

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#177:1:A>
I mean then what your finance ah <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#X178:1:A>
If lets say there is this scholarship will you do it on your own
finance

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-060#X179:1:B>
I don't think I can't I I don't think I can </X> </I>
