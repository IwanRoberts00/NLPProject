<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#1:1:A>
Your Honour I have put up briefly written submissions based on
the main issues adduced in this trial and I will go according to the subject
matter accordingly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#2:1:A>
Your Honour the first issue is what is the nature of the contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#3:1:A>
What is in fact the contractual subject matter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#4:1:A>
Your Honour the solution to this issue has to be found in the
contract dated tenth September nineteen eighty-three which is evidence in
exhibit one and two of the agreed bundle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#5:1:A>
Your Honour it is very pertinent to note that these contract was
drafted by the Defendant company and not by the Plaintiff's company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#6:1:A>
It is only countersigned by the Plaintiff's company at the end of
the contract at page two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#7:1:A>
Your Honour I submit that the subject matter of contract evidence by
this letter from the Defendant company was for the Defendant to supply
approximately eight thousand tons of P W D B one asphalt premix to the
Plaintiff's project at Yio Chu Kang Road hereafter I will just refer to the
project your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#8:1:A>
It was not a contract to supply all the asphalt premix which was
required by the project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#9:1:A>
Your Honour my inference is based on the following points the
parties contemplated that the Defendants will supply and lay approximately
eight thousand tons of asphalt premix to the project at sixty-six dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#10:1:A>
Your Honour the meaning of the word approximately means about or
more or less and this is this meaning has in fact been given by the candidate
Court of Appeal case in British Wheat Carbassing Company Limited versus E D
Eddie company limited reported in nineteen twenty-one fifty-nine Normally law
report page seventy-seven which can be found in the Plaintiff's bundle of
authorities at page twenty-three to twenty-eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#11:1:A>
If your Honour would refer to the Plaintiff's bundle of authorities
to this particular case at page twenty-three which I submit that this case
has some relevance to our case in point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#12:1:A>
Your Honour this is before the Supreme Court of Canada and in this
case the facts are stated in the headnote

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#13:1:A>
An agreement for the sale and purchase of paper contained the
following clause

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#14:1:A>
one hundred and fifty tons approximately of paper per year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#15:1:A>
And it was held your Honour the court held that on the proper
construction of these clause that the contract was for the sale of one
hundred and fifty tons of paper per year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#16:1:A>
The word approximately was only to provide against incidental
variations arising from slight and unimportant excessors or deficiency and
that each year must stand by itself the contract not being for four hundred
and fifty tons during a three year period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#17:1:A>
The words being the whole of the purchase requirements did not form
any controlling part of the contract and were merely an intimation as to the
purchaser's requirements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#18:1:A>
Your Honour I quoted this case merely to show you the meaning of
the word approximately it doesn't much go much further than that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#19:1:A>
Here the contract will sell approximately one hundred and fifty
tons of paper per year and that instead supplied short of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#20:1:A>
And I think the issue before the court is revolves the word around
the word approximately and it was held that we have to give incidental
deficiencies and surpluses to that figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#21:1:A>
So in our case the figure eight thousand tons was provided for and
therefore the actual tonnage supplied by the Defendant company was seven
thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point ninety one tons which is only
three point three per cent short and therefore the word approximately would
cover the shortfall of three point three per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#22:1:A>
May I carry on your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#23:1:A>
Next the caption re-surfacing of road at Yio Chu Kang Road in the
said contract at page one your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#24:1:A>
If you look at the caption it merely says servicing of road at Yio
Chu Kang Road

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#25:1:A>
It is submitted that this caption was used conveniently to
facilitate easy reference in the exchange of correspondence between the
parties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#26:1:A>
The caption did not specified the exact points between which the
Defendants were to lay the asphalt premix

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#27:1:A>
The Plaintiff's contract with P W D in contrast and as pleaded in
paragraph one of the statement of claim and admitted by the Defendants was to
construct and widen Yio Chu Kang Road second carriage way from Sembawang
Hills to Jalan Kayu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#28:1:A>
P W D's contract was very specific from which points of Yio Chu
Kang Road to which point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#29:1:A>
The contract made between the Plaintiff's company and the
Defendant's company never mention the exact points between which asphalt
premix had to be laid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#30:1:A>
Next your Honour clause three of the contract at page one thereof
it says that please note that we are not responsible for the variation in
thickness laid as our quotation quoted to you is on metric weight only

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#31:1:A>
Your Honour I submit that the word our quotation must referred to
the quotation as evidence in this contract and the quotation is an offer to
supply approximately eight thousand tons of asphalt premix

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#32:1:A>
There cannot be any other things besides this which is so clearly
provided for in clause two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#33:1:A>
This is reinforced by the word metric weight only and metric weight
your Honour I submit must refer to the eight thousand tons metric tons of
asphalt premix referred in clause two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#34:1:A>
Therefore clause three obviously show the intention of the writer
that this quotation is an offer to the Plaintiff's company to lay to supply
and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of asphalt premix at
sixty-six dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#35:1:A>
Any other construction would make this contract redundant in a
sense that if it is to lay the whole of the project then there is no need to
mention a quantity in the asphalt premix to be supplied

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#36:1:A>
Your Honour it is also given by P W one witness F W one in this
trial that it is customary unusual for contracts of this nature to always
bear a limit on the tonnage to be laid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#37:1:A>
Next your Honour the Defendant's statements of supply as shown in
the agreed bundle and for most of them they have printed words like site and
tons and even have column for quantity supplied tons and balance to be
supplied tons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#38:1:A>
These words are not put there for fun they must have served a
purpose

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#39:1:A>
This is basically to show or it would indicate to the defending
company when they have breached the approximate limit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#40:1:A>
If indeed the contention is that it was for the Defendant to supply
the whole of the Asphalt premix then there is no necessity when they are
laying the premix in stages to keep track of the tonnage laid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#41:1:A>
It's not necessary in fact they should have just add up the total
towards the end of the whole project and say oh this is ten thousand tons and
twelve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#42:1:A>
I submit your Honour that all these clauses and words used in this
contract point to the fact that the parties contemplated at page three of my
submissions your Honour paragraph H contemplated a quantitative definition of
the subject matter of the said contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#43:1:A>
And this subject matter was uppermost in the minds of the
contracting parties when they make the contract and it was definitely not an
open-ended contract where no quantity or tonnage is specified

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#44:1:A>
The subject matter to be gleaned from all these wordings and from
the evidence and testimony in this court in totality re-enforces the
Plaintiff's version that this contract was a simple one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#45:1:A>
It was for the Defendant company supply of approximately eight
thousand tons of Asphalt premix at sixty-six thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#46:1:A>
And not for the Defendant to supply the whole of the Asphalt premix
requirement for the project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#47:1:A>
Your Honour it is also pertinent to note that the total tonnage
laid for the whole project by the Defendants and Resources Development
Corporation total up to nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four point
fourteen tons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#48:1:A>
And in percentage terms it is twenty-three per cent more than the
estimated eight thousand tons stipulated in the said contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#49:1:A>
Your Honour P W one witness P W one had been in the road
construction business since nineteen sixty-two and is unlikely given his
experience and expertise to under provide twenty-three per cent of Asphalt
premix required by the project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#50:1:A>
Therefore P W D's testimony that he estimated eight thousand of
Asphalt premix for part of the project from Ang Mo Kio Avenue four to Yio Chu
Kang Track fourteen is credible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#51:1:A>
D W one and D W three corroborated P W one that a figure of eight
thousand tons of premix originated from the Plaintiffs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#52:1:A>
On this first point your Honour I submit this conclusion that the
Defendants had supplied seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-five point
ninety-one tons of Asphalt premix to the project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#53:1:A>
It had been permitted to perform its obligation to supply
approximately eight thousand tons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#54:1:A>
The shortfall of two hundred and sixty-four point zero nine tons or
three point three per cent of the estimated eight thousand tons is small
given the nature of this type of contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#55:1:A>
And the circumstances of this case and the de minimis rule should
apply to absolve the Plaintiff from being liable for this shortfall

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#56:1:A>
If I may proceed your Honour I will go on to the next point on the
cannons of construction of written contracts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#57:1:A>
In the case of clear and unambiguous contract your Honour I submit
that the contract was clear unequivocal and free from ambiguity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#58:1:A>
The words used therein are to be construed in their plain ordinary
and popular sense

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#59:1:A>
Clauses one and two of the contract and three in their plain and
ordinary meanings can only be interpreted to mean that the Defendants were to
supply deliver and lay approximately eight thousand metric tons of Asphalt
premix at sixty-six dollars per ton

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#60:1:A>
Clauses one and two and three I may add are not susceptible of any
other interpretation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#61:1:A>
The Defendant's contention that they were entitled under the said
contract to supply all the Asphalt premix required by the project contradicts
or varies Clauses one two and three of the contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#62:1:A>
And where the words of a written agreement have a clear and fixed
meaning extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that the parties meant
something different from what have written <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#X63:1:A>
Ninety-four </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#64:1:A>
Section ninety-four of the Evidence Act precludes the admissibility
of the testimony of D W one and D W three which seeks to show that the
parties meant something different from what have been written in the contract

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#65:1:A>
Your Honour the next point is this the Defendants drafted the
contract which was countersigned by the Plaintiffs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#66:1:A>
The rule of construction is that a deed or other instrument shall
be construed more strongly against the grantor or maker thereof

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#67:1:A>
The contra proferentum rule is best summarized by in a case of John
Lee and Son versus Rail Executive and I quote a passage of Abasad Master of
the Roll

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#68:1:A>
We are presented with two alternative readings of this document

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#69:1:A>
And the reading which should be adopted is to be determined among
other things by a consideration of the fact that the Defendants put forward
the documents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#70:1:A>
They have put forward a clause which is by no means free from
obscurity and have contented that it has a remarkably if not extravagantly
wide scope and I think that the rule contra proferentum should apply

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#71:1:A>
As in our case your Honour this is a typical case of a written
contract where the Defendant company is seeking to expand the scope of the
contractual matter so extravagantly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#72:1:A>
And I would urge your Honour to apply the contra proferentum rule
against the Defendant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#73:1:A>
I do not admit that this contract is ambiguous and capable of two
interpretations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-069#74:1:A>
But indeed it is then I submit that the contra proferentum rule
should be used against the Defendant who was the drafter of the contract </I>
