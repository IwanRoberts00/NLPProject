<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#1:1:A>
May it please the court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#2:1:A>
Your honour since there is no dispute that the Respondent Plaintiff
was incapacitated between fifth March seventy-nine and fifteenth July eight
from working I won't be going into the facts relating to that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#3:1:A>
The first issue here is whether he was entitled as of right to his
salaries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#4:1:A>
Prior to the accident your honour the Respondent was both a director
and shareholder of Seagull Marine and he was also the chairman of both
companies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#5:1:A>
But at the same time he was also a working director of that company
and his source of income would be salaries received as a working director
director's fees and dividends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#6:1:A>
And these are all shown on his income tax returns your honour from
page one hundred and forty-five of the Record of Appeal in Civil Appeal one
hundred and seventeen of eighty-seven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#7:1:A>
And in fact there on occasions he has received dividends and
occasions he has received directors fees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#8:1:A>
On page one hundred and fifty of the Record of Appeal there are
payments also for director's fees from another company and from page one
hundred and fifty-one there were dividends paid in respect of Pan Asia
Services

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#9:1:A>
But this appeal only concerns his salaries which he was drawing a
sum of two thousand dollars from Pan Asia and five hundred dollars from
Seagull Marine and he was earning these sums even prior to the accident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#10:1:A>
His income tax returns show that these were not amounts which he
just decided after the accident to take

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#11:1:A>
As such your Honour my submission is that he is an employee of the
company both the companies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#12:1:A>
And in this respect I would like to refer to the Appellant's bundle
of authorities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#13:1:A>
That's the blue bundle in one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#14:1:A>
Mr Benedict Chan's appeal my Lord bundle of authorities number
eighteen of the case marked number eighteen your Honour which was taken from
Palmer's on Company Law

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#15:1:A>
And at the bottom it's a general statement that directors are not
as such employees for the company or employed by the company nor are they
servants of the company or members of the staff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#16:1:A>
This becomes important in three way of instances

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#17:1:A>
Then it goes on on the next page but I would like to start on the
second paragraph of the next page at page eight hundred and seventy-six where
it says a director can however pull a salary employment or an office in
addition to that of his directorship which way for these purposes making an
employee or a servant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#18:1:A>
And in such a case he would enjoy any rights given to the employees
as such

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#19:1:A>
On the facts of our case my Lord it's quite clear that he was not
just a director but he was more than a director

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#20:1:A>
And there is no evidence your Honour that he was running the
company improperly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#21:1:A>
So long as the companies have complied with the requirements of the
Company's Act I do not see how one can say that it is not a separate legal
entity and that actually he was paid himself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#22:1:A>
And his loss was not or rather suggested that his loss was actually
what the monies which he received was actually an entitlement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#23:1:A>
He could be an agent on behalf of the company and at the same time
he could also contract himself when he becomes an employee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#24:1:A>
And one other fact is that this were not companies which were
solely owned by him as your Honour has pointed out in Seagull Marine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#25:1:A>
He only owned fifty per cent his son owned fifty per cent and in
Pan Asia he owned thirty per cent of the shares the rest were owned by his
son

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#26:1:A>
Now the court found your Honour that on the evidence presented that
though he continued drawing the salaries it was not paid to him as an
entitlement though the court presumed that there was an employment since he
was working but there was no evidence to suggest that it was an entitlement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#27:1:A>
And his reasons why he drew the salaries was that because otherwise
he could not survive he needed these monies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#28:1:A>
And one has to apply a very practical approach to this kind of
situation your Honour because in Singapore especially there are very many of
such companies and most people who when an incident like this occurs where
they are injured they don't think of the legalities involved at that point of
time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#29:1:A>
The more pressing needs are raised what do they need for their
medical expenses what they need for daily needs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#30:1:A>
Not whether he is entitled to draw the salary or not they just
carry on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#31:1:A>
They only apply the legalities are only addressed when they
subsequently go and consult their solicitors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#32:1:A>
And on that basis your Honour my submission is that it cannot be
accepted that what he drew as salaries was because he was entitled to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#33:1:A>
Now the points have been raised by my learned friend was that
because they were family companies he was entitled to draw his salary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#34:1:A>
My submission on that is my Lord it should not make any difference
whether it was family company or companies which were not owned by him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#35:1:A>
What difference is therefore in such a situation to another
situation where he is also a shareholder with several of his friends as
shareholders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#36:1:A>
And a similar situation arises and his other directors allow him to
continue drawing the salary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#37:1:A>
What are the principles should that situation be distinguished from
this situation or they didn't where he just said we are employee where the
employer says where he has been a long standing employee and he is injured
seriously injured and incapacitated and the employer says never mind we will
pay you your salary in the meantime and if and when you get it then we decide
whether to repay it back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#38:1:A>
Thus I don't see why anybody should discriminate in any of these
instances

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#39:1:A>
And in fact your Honour one of the cases which was cited by the
Appellants was the case of Esso Petroleum which is in support of the fact
that it is the same company and so that the plaintiff and the company are one
and the same

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#40:1:A>
That's in the same bundle which one of the issues here was the sum
of six thousand two hundred and seventy pounds which was utilized by a family
company by the defendant here who was counter-claiming for his loss

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#41:1:A>
And the arguments put forward against this claim was that it was
not his loss but his private family company's loss because the source of the
funds were from that and since the company was not claiming he should not
succeed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#42:1:A>
The court found that it was his loss but I would like to refer your
Honour to all the judgments and the first judgment it should be on page eight
hundred and twenty of Lord Denning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#43:1:A>
Sorry not eight hundred and twenty eight hundred and twenty-one
your Honour at para F in page eight hundred and twenty-one of the report
paragraph F where Lord Denning deals with the loss

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#44:1:A>
If I may just read the initial capital of six thousand two hundred
and seventy pounds was not provided by Mr Mathan personally out of his bank
account

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#45:1:A>
It is no concern of Esso where it came from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#46:1:A>
Your Honour both the court seems to imply that it was his loss at
the same time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#47:1:A>
The court also seemed to imply the judge Lord Denning that he
treated it as if that it was the loan from his own private company to him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#48:1:A>
And similarly Omrod L J at page eight hundred and thirty of the
same report after going into the facts that both Mister Mathan and the
company never kept a proper records and if I may just come to the last line
just after paragraph C

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#49:1:A>
It would be for Mister Mathan and the company to arrange their own
affairs hereafter implying that though Mister Mathan may have create treated
the company as his own he should put the affairs in order and I would think
what he meant was that these monies should go back to the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#50:1:A>
So they are actually treating these monies which Mister Mathan
received as a loan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#51:1:A>
And that is precisely what the learned trial judge in this case in
our case did

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#52:1:A>
He treated it as voluntary payments and that is supported on the
facts and it is a general rule your Honour that voluntary ex gratia payments
need not be taken into consideration when the court is assessing loss of
earnings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#53:1:A>
And I would like to refer Monkmen which is on page nine of my
bundle for the general principles it's a white bundle of authorities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#54:1:A>
And if I may just read the three situations which are relevant here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#55:1:A>
If wages of an employee have been made up by the employer the
possibility of recovering the full amount without regard to this various
according to the circumstance and in English Law three cases have to be
distinguished

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#56:1:A>
And voluntary payment is not to be concept of his loss of earnings
Cunningham versus Harrison

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#57:1:A>
And that is exactly the situation here my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#58:1:A>
So long as the salaries received or the monies received by the
Respondent were not as a result of an entitlement under his contracts for
service then a court has to need or rather need not take into account these
payments for assessing his loss of earnings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#59:1:A>
And in Cunningham versus Harrison the court there ignored the fact
that which is on page ninety-eight of my bundle that the court ignored the
fact that the employers had paid the employee an ex gratia payment for life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#60:1:A>
Then again in Dennis versus London Passenger Transport Board which
is on page seventy-six of my bundle here again the Plaintiff received as a
result of the accident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#61:1:A>
He was not paid the salaries but he received equivalent to the same
firm the Minister of Pensions and from his employers but pension in sick pay
which equivalents which amounts together which equaled to his wages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#62:1:A>
And he sued the Tort Freezer and the court held that the fact that
employers or others that paid him should or quite voluntarily paid him should
be naught

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#63:1:A>
And if I may just quote from paragraph G of the report the cardinal
point to remember is that it is the defendants who are responsible for what
has occurred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#64:1:A>
In my opinion a wrong doer is not to be allowed to reduce damages
by the extend that the other persons have made up to the Plaintiff his wages
like the London county Council versus The Ministry of Pensions in this case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#65:1:A>
Shall be paid back to these bodies out of the sums recovered

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#66:1:A>
And this is what the learned trial judge also indicated in his
judgment that the Plaintiff was under a duty to repay his monies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#67:1:A>
And on the next page in the same bundle your Honour is a Malaysian
case of Lim Kiat Boon which is more in line with the fact situation in our
case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#68:1:A>
The Plaintiff also my Lord your Honour in this case was a director
of a company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#69:1:A>
On the facts it's not shown whether if he was a shareholder

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#70:1:A>
And he was injured and his employers paid him during his incapacity
paid the medical bills and also his salary and commissions which he would
have earned

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#71:1:A>
And in fact the evidence there also was that the employers did not
expect the payment at the time they paid the salaries but subsequently they
gave evidence that if the court ordered the Tort Freezer damages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#72:1:A>
Then they expect a repayment and similarly at the trial the
Plaintiff himself give an undertaking to the court to repay these monies if
he received it back to the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#73:1:A>
And on that basis your Honour the court held that he was entitled
to claim his monies which even though he has been paid by his employers <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-063#X74:1:A>
Then if I may referred to page seventy-eight of the bundle your
Honour on the righthand side sorry not seventy-eight seventy-nine on the
lefthand side paragraph F that the court draws a distinction between payment
received as of right and voluntary payments Earlier on in paragraph E the
court cites Negregor on damages and says the courts appear never to have
taken into account in their assessment of damages for loss of earning
capacity monies gratuitously conferred from private sources upon the
Plaintiff as a mark of sympathy and assistant and this approach is fully
supported in Barry versus Cleaver by the majority and minority alike <&>  reads)
as of right from their employer either under a tort statutory or contractual
obligation the money received is deductible </X> </I>
