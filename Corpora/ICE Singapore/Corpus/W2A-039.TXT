<h> 1 INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#7:1>
Load flow, short circuit calculation and protective relay
co-ordination are separate tools most commonly used for power distribution
system operational planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#8:1>
However, these programs are normally run one at a time repeatedly, and
it is not convenient to simulate switching operation interactively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#9:1>
For severe overloading that results in cascaded tripping across he
network, normal load flow program may not be able to handle due to too many
isolated nodes and split networks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#10:1>
Furthermore, in an interconnected distribution network, it is very
difficult to determine the appropriate setting of the overcurrent relays [ 1]
to ensure that only the selected equipment should operate to isolate the
fault in the system so as to affect minimum interruption to consumers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#11:1>
This paper introduces a microcomputer-based interactive distribution
system simulator which provides an integrated tool with full graphic features
and SCADA type of operating environment for engineers to perform conveniently
the complete task of operational planning in one single process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#12:1>
In additional to the built-in automated L load flow, automated fault
current calculation, it integrates the modelling of protective relay,
calculation of tripping time and the tripping of breakers followed by post
fault load flow calculation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#13:1>
It also includes the interactive simulation of restoration of supply
by the user.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#14:1>
Thus, this integrated tool not only can be used to assess the
distribution system under various loading conditions but it can also be used
to assess thc grading of overcurrent relays under various fault and
overloading conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#15:1>
<h> 2 MODELLING AND MANIPUIATION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#16:1>
<h> 2.1 Distribution System Representation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#17:1>
Each distribution system is defined and represented in the simulator
by two files named NAMEID.DAT and NAMEID.DW where NAMEID is the name of a
particular distribution system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#18:1>
Thus, different distribution system can be represented by using
different NAMEID.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#19:1>
The DAT file contains not only the basic network parameters such as
number of busbars, number of lines, busbar loading, line and transformer
impedance, line and transformer connection, source impedance, etc., but also
the breaker open/close status, and the CT ratio, type of relay, relay setting
of each breaker etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#20:1>
The DW file is a picture file which is used to generate the single
line diagram of the distribution system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#21:1>
With these two data files and the built-in fault current calculation,
overcurrent relay modelling and load flow, plus the necessary facilities for
man-machine interface, a distribution simulator can thus be constructed by
software in a microcomputer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#22:1>
During run-time, after a particular distribution system has been
selected, the simulator reads the picture file NAMEID.DW and displays the
single line diagram on the VDU.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#23:1>
Based on all the network parameters including breaker open/close
status from the file NAMEID.DAT, the simulator calculates load flow and
displays current flow for each line on the single line-diagram.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#24:1>
The simulator will then constantly monitor each breaker status,
feeder loading and model the operation of all protective relays.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#25:1>
If a fault is applied by the user, the simulator calculates the fault
current distribution and the operating time of all the relays.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#26:1>
The breaker connected to the relay which has the lowest operating
time will trip.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#27:1>
Whenever any breaker trips and hence alters the network
configuration, the simulator determines whether the fault has been totally
isolated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#28:1>
If the fault is not isolated, it re-calculates the fault current
distribution and continues the modelling of all the relays repeatedly until
some other breakers trip and the fault is totally isolated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#29:1>
For example, for a busbar fault at busbar 6, the tripping time of
seven breakers operated by the overcurrent relays to isolate the fault is
shown in Figure 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#30:1>
If no fault is applied to the system or after the fault has been
isolated, the simulator calculates load flow and displays the current flow on
the single line diagram as show in fig 2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#31:1>
At the same time, each line current is injected to the corresponding
relay to test for overload.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#32:1>
If the overload exceeds the relay setting, the relay may then
operates and the breaker will trip.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#33:1>
The stimulator hence re-calculates load flow, as the network
configuration has altered, and continues the modelling of all the overcurrent
relays until there is no overloaded tripping detected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#34:1>
Facilities are also provided for the user to interrupt the process,
and restore supply by switching on or off the appropriate breaker, reducing
the substation load or adjusting the relay settings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#35:1>
<h> 2.2 Interactive User Manipulation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#36:1>
The user manipulation is interactive and made similar to that
commonly used in a supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) control
centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#37:1>
Thc user can elect to operate ( ie open, close or block) a breaker
and the simulator will generate a special cursor to guide the user to select
the desired breaker.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#38:1>
Overloading or fault at any busbar or any line terminal can be
activated conveniently on the single line diagram using menu driven function
keys by the user, or generated randomly by the simulator.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#39:1>
Similarly, loading at each substation can be updated interactively
through the pop-up window ( as shown in Figure 3) by the user with the option
for random load to be increased up to a pre-specified limit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#40:1>
During run-time, the current plug setting ( PS) and the time
multiplier setting ( MS) of each overcurrent relay can be viewed or changed
through the pop-up window ( as shown in Figure 4).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#41:1>
Each breaker can also be blocked to simulate the breaker or relay
failure so that the breaker will not trip during any fault condition and the
effect of the upstream relay operation can be assessed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#42:1>
2.3 Overcurrent relay Modelling Three types of inverse definite
minimum time ( IDMT) overcurrent relays based on BS]42 are modelled.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#43:1>
Additional compensation is made to take into account the fact that
the fault current sensed by each relay may not be constant in an
interconnected network.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#44:1>
The relay constant K expressed as a multiple of the relay's setting
current can be defined as [ 2]: <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X45:1>
K = If x 100 ( 1) CTP x PS where If = constant fault current in
amperes, CTP = current transformer primary current rating in amperes and PS =
relay plug setting in percentage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X46:1>
The time/ current characteristic of an IDMT overcurrent relay for a
given fault current 1f can be expressed as:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X47:1>
For Normal Inverse Overcurrent Relay 0.14 t = 0.14 K 0.02 - 1 x TMS

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X48:1>
For Very Inverse Overcurrent Relay t= 13.5 K - 1 x TMS

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X49:1>
For Extremely Inverse Overcurrent Relay t = 80 K2-1 x TMS where t is
the operating time and TMS is the time multiplier sending of the IDMT
overcurrent relay.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X50:1>
The tripping time of an overcurrent relay under variable fault
currents may be compensated as follows [ 2]: % t Comp = t ( If2) x % Comp (
If1,S fast) ( 5) where If1 is the original fault current causing the tripping
of the faster relay operated in Sfast second.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X51:1>
It has altered the network configuration and hence it results in a
new fault current If2 passing through this relay.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X52:1>
The percentage compensation of a particular overcurrent relay is
defined as: % Comp = 100% - Sfast x lOO% ( 6) t(If1) </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#53:1>
For example, consider a relay which has a CT ratio of 300/5, PS=150%
and TMS = 0.9.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#54:1>
If the fault current passing through this relay is 8kA for 0.3
second; and it the then reduces to 7kA due to the operation of some other
faster relay which has operated in 0.3 second, the operating time of this
relay can bc calculated as from equations ( 1) to ( 6). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X55:1>
K= 8000 x 100 = 17.78 300 x 150 t ( 8 kA) = 0.14 = 2.127 seconds
17.78 0.02 - 1 % Comp = 100% - 0.3 x 100% = 85.89% 2.127

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#X56:1>
Similarly, the operating time of the relay at 7 kA is t ( 7kA) =
2.233 seconds tComp ( 8kA,7kA) = 2.233 x 85.89% = 1.918seconds </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#57:1>
<h> 3 APPLICATIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#58:1>
<h> 3.1 Assessment of Overcurrent Relay Setting </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#59:1>
Distribution system is usually designed to cater for the
interconnection of more than one source but may be operated radially through
network cut.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#60:1>
However, there are cases that this network cut may have to be closed
to form a ring temporarily or permanently to increase the reliability and to
maintain a high level of continuity of supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#61:1>
Overcurrent relays, however, are usually graded according to the
network operated radially feeding from one source only.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#62:1>
What will be the performance of these relays during fault and
overloading conditions when this network is operated as ring with two sources
or even interconnected with more than two sources?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#63:1>
Under various fault conditions, what will be the tripping sequence
and how serious will be the loss of supply?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#64:1>
These operational problems can be verified or examined
straightforwardly in one single run by using this simulator.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#65:1>
The engineer may even vary the setting scheme and observes the effect
during the simulated fault or overloading conditions and works out the
necessary adjustment in setting when the network configuration changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#66:1>
He may also block a particular break to simulate breaker failure or
the malfunction of the relay and examine the operation of other relays.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#67:1>
<h> 3.2 System Security Assessment </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#68:1>
Due to load growth and many other reasons, the load at each
substation is usually quite different from the load estimated during design
stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#69:1>
Thus, in actual operation, some feeders may be heavily loaded but
some other feeders may be no load at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#70:1>
In terms of security of supply, should the network be operated as
radial, or ring, or mixed?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#71:1>
If it is operated as radial, how do we recommend the appropriate
network cut?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#72:1>
Under various feeder conditions, can supply to the whole area be
still maintained?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#73:1>
This integrated tool was designed to assist engineer to solve all the
abovementioned operational problems through simulations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#74:1>
Furthermore, it also provides options to increase the load at any
substation and/or to apply a controlled random load increase to all
substations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#75:1>
These options can thus be used to activate various overloading
conditions which will trip some breakers and if it is severely overloaded, it
may result in cascaded tripping across the network.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#76:1>
The engineer can then practice on how to restore the supply, examine
how to interconnect the split network and see if the total load can be
supplied with only one or two feeders available.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#77:1>
The engineer can also locate the critical feeders which when removed
generate the greatest number of network overloading and then re-distribute
the load whenever possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#78:1>
<h> 3.3 Establish Rules for Restoration of Supply </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#79:1>
Supply interruption is always un-avoidable and the operational
engineer has to depend on his experience and his knowledge on the
distribution system to isolate the fault and to restore supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#80:1>
This integrated tool provides the platform for a engineer to generate
standard rules for the restoration of supply well in advance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#81:1>
Based on the actual loading condition and the network configuration,
the engineer can generate various abnormal condition such as a line fault, a
busbar fault, a major incoming failure, a minor overloading, a serious
overloading, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#82:1>
which will trip some breakers and result in loss of supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#83:1>
The engineer can then restore the supply on the simulator and then
works out the standard procedure or rules for the restoration of supply for
each abnormal case.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#84:1>
These rules can also be updated updated whenever major load increased
or network configuration changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#85:1>
<h> 3.4 Evaluate and Test Distribution Network Proposals </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#86:1>
For new development, two or three different network proposals are
usually suggested.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#87:1>
This integrated tool can be used to evaluate each network proposal
under various fault and overloading conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#88:1>
The level of reliability of each proposal and its operating
constraints and limits can be compared easily through this simulation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#89:1>
A better network proposal can then be recommended.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#90:1>
Furthermore, the setting of overcurrent relays can be verified and
adjusted before installation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#91:1>
<h> 3.5 Engineer Training </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#92:1>
This simulator can also be used to train new practising engineering
to familiarize with the interconnected distribution system and the associated
overcurrent protective scheme, the possible fault and overloading conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#93:1>
It gives practising engineers the opportunity to witness first hand
how a power system behaves under various fault or overloading conditions;
their consequences; the proper diagnosis procedures; and the recovery
actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#94:1>
It provides hands on exercise to practise logical thinking to
identify the type of abnormal conditions, to isolate the fault and to carry
out the appropriate actions to restore supply in a typical distribution
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#95:1>
Based on the relay settings viewed from the network, the engineer can
also select the random fault option with a hidden fault location and analyse
the timing of the tripping sequence to identify the type of fault and its
location.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#96:1>
An option to reveal the hidden location can then be activated to
confirm the finding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-039#97:1>

in an IBM PC - AT or compatible running at 8 MHz with EGA colour monitor and
no printer or other hardware is required.
