<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X1:1> The Great Marriage Debate Revisited </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#2:1:A>
Good evening and welcome to Points of View

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#3:1:A>
Not enough married people and not enough babies that was the message
almost ten years ago

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#4:1:A>
What followed became known as the Great Marriage Debate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#5:1:A>
Since then a lot has been done to encourage singles to get married

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#6:1:A>
I'm sure you've heard of the SDU SDS and SPS

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#7:1:A>
These are specialized groups that have been set up to cater to
singles from all walks of life and yet the number of marriages has not
increased and even those who are getting married are doing so later and
having children later as well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#8:1:A>
Tonight we ask why

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#9:1:A>
Why is this pattern of delayed marriage and parenthood still so
widespread even after attempts to change it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#10:1:A>
To discuss this I have with me experts and laymen both single and
married Mr K Shanmugam who's the MP for the Sembawang GRC is also with us
tonight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#11:1:A>
I also have with me two people who typify married people and single
people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#12:1:A>
Let's start with you Terry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#13:1:A>
You're a bachelor and you've got many friends who are also singles

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#14:1:A>
Why do you think singles are delaying marriage

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#15:1:B>
Well I'm not sure if I actually typify the actual bachelor so
I'll just say this for myself but you find that uhm in many situation they
they people are being pushed to excel in their career they want to go places
they want to travel they want to get experience in working overseas and
things like that don't work very well when you are actually within a marriage
when you got uhm a wife and two kids to bring along with you and I think that
tends to put people uh to make people want to push marriage further until
they've actually gone through that kind of thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#16:1:A>
Weng Hee as a married man do you think that his points are
valid

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#17:1:C>
Yes basically I would agree with what Terry has said but I'd
like to add on and say that Singaporeans these days aspire to a standard of
living characterized by material comfort and a lot of independence a lot of
freedom and as a result they now perceive marriage as an institution which
will impose on their financial well-being and on their independence

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#18:1:C>
Hence uh they'll want to have a good life they want to achieve
before they finally settle down

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#19:1:A>
Is are these points valid 'Achievement-oriented people' 'Career-minded
people' is it all valid

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#20:1:D>
Well these days actually their education opportunities and
work opportunities are much greater I think it's natural when these
opportunities are available people tend to marry a bit later

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#21:1:D>
Firstly they'll finish education much later and then they had have
to establish their career so I think it's not uh something we don't expect if
marriage is being delayed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#22:1:A>
Where did this mindset arise though

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#23:1:A>
Is it something that we've been brought up to think

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#24:1:E>
I think that's that's true because since young we have been
conditioned to think that you know we have to go through various stages

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#25:1:E>
First you go to say primary school secondary school after that JC
university and during that path you're not allowed to think about anything
else

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#26:1:E>
So the the mindset is is has been conditioned from right from young

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#27:1:C>
Ya I recall that as a Junior College student uhm courtship was
frowned upon

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#28:1:C>
We were told 'Go and complete your studies' uh 'Go into National
Service You'll be more matured uh the the the after having gone through the
process of National Service go to university study develop a career and then
you can uh think about marriage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#29:1:C>
For some reason uh students who actually have steady girlfriends in
junior college days are perceived as students who are not serious in their
work

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#30:1:C>
There's a stigma attached to uh being involved in a relationship in
junior college

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#31:1:A>
But is this stigma something that we carry with us over into
our working lives and into our adulthood

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#32:1:F>
I think perhaps it's much more

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#33:1:F>
Really the structure because both the last two have mentioned
really what a macro thing the kind of society we live in that they that the
expectations of us are different the opportunities are different

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#34:1:F>
I mean in the old days there weren't that many nice things happen
to you and getting married was one of the few really nice things

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#35:1:F>
Now there are so many other nice and exciting things and I think in
<unclear> word </unclear> part of the kind of society we live in

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#36:1:G>
We see that more and more couples are opting for what I call
companionate marriages and so uhm we do have uh people who go through a sort
of a childless period and it's as if their life is in a holding pattern you
know and then suddenly after many years then there's the arrival of the first
child

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#37:1:G>
Uhm but I think uh the norm is still that most people tend to
associate marriage with parenthood

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#38:1:A>
Well can't companionship like you said be achieved without
marriage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#39:1:A>
People can very happily have boyfriends or girlfriends steady
relationships and not take a plunge and get married

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#40:1:A>
What's the difference

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#41:1:H>
Well many people might ask that question which is why you find
a significant number of of proportion of people uh choosing to stay single
and uh choosing to have uh such friendships and without going into whether
it's right or wrong or passing any moral judgements we must realize that
there's there's such a feeling and uhm such an attitude and deal with that in
the larger social context

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#42:1:A>
But should we be dealing with attitudes though because some
people have considered that social engineering

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#43:1:H>
Well I think perhaps uh you've got me wrong I I didn't suggest
that you try and change such social attitudes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#44:1:H>
Well what you're saying well there is a perceived policy a
suggestion that we should try and have as many as much well try and increase
the number of marriages uh try and have people marry and if possible have
children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#45:1:H>
Now that's stated as a larger social call but when you try and
state that as a social call you must realize that there are significant
number of people who will choose not to get married for various reasons
economic social personal but in a free society we are entitled to do that and
a large group of people who may choose to get married but not have children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#46:1:H>
You must try and understand why they choose to do that and then I
don't think it is there's anything wrong in trying to uh win their hearts by
reason if you think it's better that they should get married and they should
have children

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#47:1:A>
Right before we of course try and win their hearts we have to
look into uh reasons as to why people are still putting it off putting
marriage off

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#48:1:A>
Perhaps we can hear from one of the singles in our group Edward

<$I> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#49:1:I>
Well basically a very significant reason is uh financial
reason

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#50:1:I>
Marriage is not a cheap thing these days and I think a lot of
people have got very high expectations what uh they expect of the marriage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#51:1:I>
So it means that uh you you find people saving up for house some of
them even want a landed property before they get married and uh it may be a
bit uh too much of a high expectation but there it goes you know uh people do
think that way

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#52:1:D>
Well I I know a lot of people like to have a Mercedes Benz but
that doesn't stop them from moving about by bus or MRT or even in a less
expensive car you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#53:1:A>
Comes down to a question of priorities doesn't it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#54:1:D>
Yes that's right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#55:1:A>
Are are these expectations uhm realistic

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#56:1:H>
Well I'm not quite sure that I agree with Edward in saying
that uh financial considerations play a significant part because in the
modern Singapore you would find that both marriage partners are probably
working

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#57:1:H>
So marriage does not per se impose a greater economic burden on
either party

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#58:1:H>
I think it's more a question of whether people feel materially
committed towards marriage and uh these may perhaps be additional factors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#59:1:H>
The economic factors could may perhaps be additional factors but
the more important factor is whether people feel that they can be involved in
a relationship which is going to demand quite a bit out of them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#60:1:H>
So it's one of attitude a different social value system

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#61:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> I pick up on the point you made
about commitment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#62:1:A>
There are some people who would say well marriage is is too much of
a commitment in a sense that it's a mental burden for them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#63:1:A>
Is this a fair judgement

<$J> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#64:1:J>
I think it's rather unfair because if you're not married how
can you make a judgement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#65:1:J>
It's too much of a commitment <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#66:1:B>
But then once you're married it's too late <unclear> word
</unclear> wrong

<$J> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#67:1:J>
Well see this see this where perception comes in because the
moment you have a pre-conceived idea as to what marriage is about then you
may be put off getting married and and that's a concern there that the longer
you delay then the less uh uh unfortunate it will be for Singapore

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#68:1:C>
I'm inclined to believe that Singaporeans generally value
fidelity in marriage and they also look forward to a happy uh family life

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#69:1:C>
For that reason they are afraid to commit lest they may make a
wrong decision

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#70:1:C>
It is this fear of making a wrong decision uh that actually
prevents a lot from really committing to a relationship

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#71:1:A>
So you're saying that fear actually cripples some quarters of
people is that right for you

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#72:1:H>
Well fear perhaps might be too strong a word putting it in a
context of a modern-day Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#73:1:H>
To perhaps fairly ambitious individuals perhaps well-educated
trying to live with each other trying to adjust themselves to each other

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#74:1:H>
It's not an easy thing to do and and uh perhaps fear might be too
strong a word but certainly uhm the uh the it can be described that fact can
be described as one of 'Well I'm not quite sure that I'm prepared to make
that many adjustments at this stage I prefer my freedom to the uh adjustments
that I have to make if I commit'

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#75:1:A>
Is that a selfish attitude though

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#76:1:H>
I don't think that is right to characterize that attitude as a
selfish attitude because I'm not harming anyone else

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#77:1:H>
I'm should should be free to live my life as I wish

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#78:1:A>
So there is a very real argument for remaining single after
all is that right

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#79:1:F>
I think actually <unclear> word </unclear> although the older
generation are pictured as always encouraging the young to marry sometimes
they have contributed to this fear of commitment because many of the older
generation of parents kept emphasising to their children how much sacrifice
they've made oh how what a burden life had been

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#80:1:F>
I'm not sure if that hasn't really contributed to the fear of
commitment that people have mentioned even though it's come from a very
conservative source

<$I> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#81:1:I>
Not only that I think a lot of uh uh parents who tell their
kids you know uh 'If you get married you know be sure you look after your
children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#82:1:I>
Uh uh I'm not about to look after the kids for you after I've
struggled all these years'

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#83:1:I>
I think that's not being supportive also because I if if indeed
they are trying to promote uh the kids getting married faster then I think
you know you might be prepared to also look to the grandchildren uh

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#84:1:F>
Well speaking as a working grandmother I I I think we just
have to face it with uh we will fewer and fewer as we get a higher proportion
of grandmothers who've got complete in secondary schooling and the society
says it needs everybody's labour contribution

<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#85:1:F>
I agree the granny's the obvious one but I think we probably got to
learn to do without her because society says everybody must you know take
part in economic activity <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X86:1:B>
Actually I'm wondering if there's a clash there somewhere
because when you're talking about uhm the parent giving a negative uhm
connotation to the idea of marriage and all that I was thinking sometimes in
many cases you don't really have a a a valid pattern to follow in terms of
the parent because of the uhm rapid change of uh as <unclear> word </unclear>
as <unclear> word </unclear> I said progress social progress and economic
progress The actual pattern and relationship and lifestyle of my parents
don't actually apply anymore to to a uhm double-income family <unclear> word
</unclear> career

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X87:1:A>
You're saying that are you saying that we're lacking role
models

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X88:1:B>
Yes I think so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X89:1:A>
Is that true Is that a valid point Role-models

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-025#X90:1:G>
I think I would tend to agree with with that because I think
uhm young couples nowadays are what we call uh pioneers in a brave new world
you know and then the old rules don't apply because the older generation
always said 'Oh we used to have ten a dozen' You know they grow like bean
sprouts I mean what's the problem And then you know our generation today with
the you know high emphasis on being achievers and and also I think cost of
living Things are actually are are actually becoming much more expensive and
I know that even though when you talk about women having to do a juggling act
but the men actually go through an intensifying act because they have to work
that much harder they have to stay back in the office that longer hours to
earn the extra dollar you know So sometimes when you when you talk about a
priority like you want somebody to be career-risked uhm he is going to be so
uhm you know hard-driving that he probably won't be able to spend that much
time uhm at the homefront So I think we're really asking for a very different
creature uh from the kinds of couples that used to get married say twenty
thirty years ago </X> </I>
