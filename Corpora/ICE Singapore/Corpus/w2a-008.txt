<h> Stars </h>

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#7:1>
BEING commercial theatre, bangsawan depicted its performers not just
as actors and actresses but as stars ( bintang), that is, they were
professionals who worked as entertainers.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#8:1>
Unlike performers of the traditional wayang kulit or makyong who
usually had other sources of income such as farming, for the bangsawan
performer, particularly the stars viewed, acting was a full-time occupation.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#9:1>
The sri panggung ( heroine) and orang muda ( hero) were the key
members of the troupe; they were its stars.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#10:1>
As the Malacca Guardian ( 9 May 1932) reported, 'the whole company
gives way to the star, who gets a liberal sum of about forty pounds per
week'.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#11:1>
It was the stars which established a company's reputation.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#12:1>
The following announcements that 'the most famous actors, actresses
and clowns from Medan, Batavia and Singapore' had arrived to tour Malaya (
7imes of Malaya, 22 January 1926) were typical: The Starlight Opera Co.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#13:1>
beg to announce the appearance of their young, beautiful, charming,
attractive and famous new actress Miss Fatimah of Singapore who has never
played in the FMS and is specialized in Extra Turns.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#14:1>
Her songs in different languages are so numerous that they will not
be repeated until she has sung the whole series.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#15:1>
It will be delightful to see how pretty she looks, how clever she
dances, how sweet she sings ( Times of Malaya, 29 December 1925).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#16:1>
Several new artistes have arrived by the SS Denver Van Tuves
yesterday to augment the troupe of the Rose Opera.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#17:1>
Misses Paulino and Gina with Bob and Kasban, the well-known and
popular Kronchong singers of Medan, and Haji Hassan, the famous Gambus Player
and singer are amongst the arrivals to join force with the Sri Rose Opera (
Straits Echo, 10 December 1932).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#18:1>
Performers of varied ethnic backgrounds were recruited and promoted
as stars.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#19:1>
Miss Van Cantarfischer and Miss Dora van Smith were important
European prima donnas of the Indra Permata Theatrical Co.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#20:1>
Their 'acting and singing' were reportedly so fine that they 'elicited
loud applause from the audience' ( Straits Echo, 19 May 1904).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#21:1>
Mr Tan Tjeng Bok was a well-known Chinese actor.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#22:1>
Born in Java, he was also known as the 'Douglas Fairbanks of Java'
and he acted in the famous Dardanella and Miss Riboet's Orion.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#23:1>
In 1933, Tan Tjeng Bok joined the Moonlight Opera Co.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#24:1>
of Penang and captivated the audience with his 'singing of the
kroncong' ( Straits F cho, 1 May 1933).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#25:1>
In yet another performance by the same company, an Arab performer, 'Sheik
Omar was applauded for his excellent singing' ( Straits Echo, 22 May 1933).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#26:1>
Child stars were promoted as novelties.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#27:1>
The audience at a Wayang Kassim performance was invited to see 'the
youngest clown in the world' who was 'only five years old' ( Straits Echo, 8
August 1908).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#28:1>
The Kinta Opera Co had its Miss Echon, a 'nine-year-old actress' who
sang English songs ( Straits Echo, 3 January 1925), while Genani Star Opera
boasted of 'Baby Star Miss Nani' ( Straits Echo, 7 November 1925).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#29:1>
<h> Recruits of Various Ethnic Backgrounds </h>

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#30:1>
What attracted young people of various ethnic origins to join the
bangsawan troupes?

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#31:1>
The stories related to me told of motives which were not very
different from those of young men and women aspiring to be actors and
actresses in the film world of today.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#32:1>
Young boys from the kampong were lured to thc town to earn a living,
many no longer contented with a life of farming.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#33:1>
Others came from poor or broken homes; they saw the bangsawan as a
way to earn a living ( cari makan) or to see the world ( merantau tempat).

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#34:1>
All who joined bangsawan were tempted by the glamour of stardom and
fame which the touring companies - and the urban areas, seen as places of
adventure, excitement, and drama offered.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#35:1>
In his late eighties when I met him, Wan ( Plate 30), a former orang
muda, manager of Starlight Opera, and proprietor of Wan Man Sri Bangsawan,
remembered that as a young boy he had always wanted to see the world.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#36:1>
After completing four years of schooling in Penang, Wan decided to
become independent of his parents and to earn money so that he could travel.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#37:1>
His father, a schoolteacher, could not do anything to change his
mind.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#38:1>
Wan left school and found himself a job as a delivery boy for the
Fraser and Neave Aerated Water Company, delivering bottles of aerated water
to shops on his three-wheel bicycle for
&dollar;12 a month.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#39:1>
However, he still could not afford to travel to the places he had
heard of.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#40:1>
Disheartened, he looked up a Bengali friend, a bangsawan performer by
the name of Babjan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#41:1>
Wan recalled the advice of Babjan: 'Wan, Wan, if you want to travel
but do not have money, join the bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#42:1>
Food and shelter will be provided, and you will get to go places'.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#43:1>
He was about fourteen or fifteen years old then.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#44:1>
Many recruits came from impoverished or broken homes.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#45:1>
The 70 year-old veteran orang muda, Mahmud Jun, was born the son of a
poor farmer.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#46:1>
Leaving his family and village at the age of fourteen with
&dollar;3 in his pocket, he took the train from Alor Star to Ipoh.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#47:1>
There, he helped a porter to carry baggage at the railway station in
return for some pocket money.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#48:1>
Then he set up a stall selling noodles in a park.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#49:1>
It was there, two or three months later, that a bangsawan troupe, the
Grand Jubilee Opera owned by Shaw Brothers, happened to pitch its tent.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#50:1>
The general manager was a Kedah man who used to live in Mahmud Jun's
village.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#51:1>
'He knew my father and my uncle but he was richer than we were,'
Mahmud Jun said.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#52:1>
The manager told Mahmud, 'Follow me and work in the bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#53:1>
If I see your father, he would be angry with me if I did not take
care of you'.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#54:1>
'That was how I joined the bangsawan and became like his son,'
according to Mahmud Jun.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#55:1>
In his late eighties, Suki, a former orang Jnuda, film star and owner
of Dian Sandiwara, gave me the following account of why he went into
bangsawan acting.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#56:1>
Born in Padang, Sumatra, Suki joined the bangsawan because he wanted
to look for his father who had left home to manage the estate of the Sultan
of Negeri Sembilan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#57:1>
Suki's father was the chief police ranger of Padang but had quit the
police force because he disliked the Dutch colonialists.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#58:1>
By then, he had already divorced Suki's mother.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#59:1>
After his mother died, Suki stayed with his grandmother for a while.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#60:1>
But he wanted to meet his father again.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#61:1>
'I thought that if I joined the opera, I would have the opportunity
to go to Singapore and then to the mainland to look for my father,' he said.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#62:1>
So when the Royal Opera came to Padang, Suki offered his services.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#63:1>
'The manager took me in as I had the looks and could sing and act'.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#64:1>
Ainon Chik ( Plate 31), a 70-year-old veteran sri panggung, recalled
that she followed her sister and brother-in-law who joined Genani Star Opera
after the death of both her parents in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#65:1>
The sisters had no relatives to turn to.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#66:1>
Ainon's mother was a Sarawakian Chinese while her father was a Bugis
who had migrated to Sarawak.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#67:1>
Ainon's parents eloped to Singapore because her grandparents did not
approve of the mixed marriage.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#68:1>
Ainon was eight years old then.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#69:1>
'My brother-in-law could earn twice as much as an electrician and
stage hand in the bangsawan than as an electrician in a private firm,' she
said.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#70:1>
Menah Yem ( Plate 32), a well known dancer and sri panggung of her
time, started performing in the bangsawan at the age of nine.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#71:1>
That was almost eighty years ago.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#72:1>
Menah Yem's mother joined the City Opera ( owned by Ong Peng Hock)
after she separated from her husband.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#73:1>
So Menah grew up with bangsawan performers as her larger family.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#74:1>
She sang in the chorus and replaced other, more experienced child
actors when they fell ill.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#75:1>
Mat Arab ( Plate 31 ) , a famous comedian, now in his seventies,
claimed that he was left to fend for himself at an early age after both his
parents died.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#76:1>
His father was an Arab who worked in the police force while his
mother was a Malay woman from the kampong.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#77:1>
With no brothers or sisters to take care of him, Mat Arab followed a
bangsawan man by the name of Haji Pokar, or 'Ging', as he was commonly known.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#78:1>
Ging adopted Mat Arab as his son and brought him to Singapore where
he joined the City Opera.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#79:1>
'I went because I had no one to turn to.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#80:1>
Besides, Ging said that it would be enjoyable,' added Mat Arab.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#81:1>
Other performers grew up in the midst of bangsawan activity.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#82:1>
Their parents were performers or proprietors of famous bangsawan
companies.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#83:1>
Rahman B's father, Bakar M, was the proprietor of Rahman Star Opera,
which was named after Rahman B ( Plate 33), the eldest son.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#84:1>
<h> THE PROMOTION OF STARS </h>

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#85:1>
His brother Rahim B ( Plate 34) and sister Rohani B also performed in
the troupe.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#86:1>
Minah Alias ( Plate 35), a former heroine who is in her seventies and
who instructs the Bangsawan Sri USM today, came from a family of actors and
performers.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#87:1>
Her grandfather was a shadow puppeteer ( dalang) in Java.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#88:1>
Her father, Nani bin Haji Omar, started off as a dalang and an actor
in the wayang wong ( orang) but joined the opera upon the invitation of a
Chinese opera owner.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#89:1>
Nani soon became a hero and a star in bangsawan and was sought after
by women of all ethnic backgrounds.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#90:1>
Minah's mother, Catharine de Brish, a foreigner, was one of these
women.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#91:1>
After watching Nani's performance, Catharine de Brish fell in love
with him, attending his performances every night, making eyes at Nani and
throwing flowers to him after the performances.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#92:1>
When Catharine's brother forbade her to see Nani, she fell ill.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#93:1>
Nani and Catharine finally got married and she joined the bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#94:1>
It was inevitable that Minah, coming from such a family, was to take
up acting as well.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#95:1>
The late Alfonso Soliano, pianist and band leader of bangsawan, and
later conductor of the Orkes Radio Malaya, was a Filipino who came from a
family of musicians.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#96:1>
His parents were among the sixty-four musicians engaged by the
British government to form the Selangor State Band.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#97:1>
When the Band disbanded in 1927, all the musicians except one stayed
on in Malaya.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#98:1>
These musicians played in night-clubs, hotels, cabarets, funeral
bands, and in the bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#99:1>
Soliano's father, Rupino, a string bass player, performed with the
Lake Band which accompanied silent movies, and subsequently joined the
bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#100:1>
That was how Alfonso's whole family became involved in the
bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#101:1>
Soliano's mother, Pacita, became a bangsawan singer, his two sisters
were dancers and singers, and his brother Jerry played the violin and later
became a band leader.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#102:1>
Alfonso himself studied under his father and brother and became a
bangsawan pianist.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#103:1>
Yahya Sulong, a well-known comedian today, was literally born on the
bangsawan stage of the New World Park about sixty years ago.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#104:1>
'My mother began to have labour pains when she was performing the
story " Panglima Alam Yahya".

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#105:1>
That is why I was named Yahya,' he said.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#106:1>
There were others who were so attracted to the bangsawan that they
ran away from their homes to join it.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#107:1>
Abdullah Abdul Rahman's father had been a chief surveyor and wanted
him to finish his Senior Cambridge so that he could get a good job.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#108:1>
But Abdullah had been interested in acting since he was a child,
having become familiar with bangsawan performances whenever they were staged
at the park.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#109:1>
'After I finished my Junior Cambridge examinations, I decided to
quit school to join the bangsawan.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#110:1>
I did not dare tell my father.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#111:1>
He did not know where I was till he saw me on stage many years
later!' Abdullah declared. <X>

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X112:1>
My bangsawan music teacher, Mat Hashim ( Plate 10), also joined a
bangsawan troupe without his parents' knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X113:1>
'I used to go to the performances of the Oriental Opera of Selangor
every night when it was playing in Butterworth,' recalled the sixty-year-old
Mat.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X114:1>
'I made friends with the child actors and played with them after
school.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X115:1>
When the troupe left, I followed them'.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X116:1>
Realizing that he would be punished for doing so, Mat did not dare
go home for the next four years.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X117:1>
The opera troupe fed and clothed him.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X118:1>
Finally, there were some who were recruited by bangsawan troupes
because of their skills as tailors or football players.

<ICE-SIN:w2a-008#X119:1>
( Bangsazvatl troupes competed with each other in football.) Such
was the case of Alias Manan ( Plate 7), who also instructs the Bangsawan Sri
USM today. </X> </I>
