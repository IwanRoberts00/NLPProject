<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#1:1:A>
Mr Speaker Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#2:1:A>
Mr Speaker Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#3:1:A>
Allow me to express my appreciation for this opportunity to
participate in this debate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#4:1:A>
Sir I have uh noticed of late nearly all the ministers if not some
of the members of parliament have been lamenting that there is a trend in
Singapore for the people to make use of the reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#5:1:A>
Now I do not know where they get this feedback other than the fact
that polls have been carried out and seems to give the impression that some
Singaporeans are going for more use of the reserve

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#6:1:A>
I think the question here is what sort of question or rather
questionnaires were in fact put to the voters or to the uh resident of
Singapore regarding the use of reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#7:1:A>
Now if the question is simple one to say

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#8:1:A>
would you want to make use of the reserve to improve your living

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#9:1:A>
I'm afraid the answer would be a yes simply yes But I think it is
important here to draw a distinction between you know budgetary surpluses and
all the surpluses accumulate by the statutory bodies over the years and the
question should be rightly asked:

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#10:1:A>
do you think the government should put all the surpluses in
reserves and not just would you want to make use of reserve to improve your
standard of living

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#11:1:A>
I think if the question had been put differently you would get a
different set of answer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#12:1:A>
Now there are from the poll it is quite that majority of
Singaporean believe that Singapore should have more reserves that government
should put aside as reserve for rainy days I suppose

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#13:1:A>
The question here is it is not whether the reserve should be spent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#14:1:A>
I think the question here is what is the limit that the government
should put aside our surpluses as reserves Now what is the limit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#15:1:A>
Now if that is the limit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#16:1:A>
is not defined

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#17:1:A>
there'll be no end to the whole thing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#18:1:A>
Every time you clamor for more subsidies you are being accused of
utilising the reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#19:1:A>
But where where where do you stand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#20:1:A>
Do do we say we keep on accumulate massive reserves at the same
time neglected certain area where we need to have more subsidies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#21:1:A>
Example will be like education housing and health

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#22:1:A>
Now why is the government grudged that more subsidies be given in
the field of education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#23:1:A>
For the simple reason is now with more and more schools being
converted to independent schools you are confining to only twenty five
percent of them having would be able to get scholarships

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#24:1:A>
Now what about the other seventy five percent of the students

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#25:1:A>
Are we assuming that all students that can manage to the
independent schools are from well-off family

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#26:1:A>
I I I thought statistics have already been given that most of them
are from housing board estates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#27:1:A>
that would be a clear indication that they are either from the
middle or lower income group

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#28:1:A>
And also it has been established or it is accepted fact that the
only resource we have in Singapore is the human resource

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#29:1:A>
Now why is the government not considering subsidising more for
education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#30:1:A>
We are so bogged down with the fear of our national reserve being
used

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#31:1:A>
We have in fact lost the true meaning of what is the question of uh
reserve being utilised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#32:1:A>
and what is the question of uh you know more subsidies in certain
field which is consider as investment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#33:1:A>
The government should when come to question of subsidies or
reserves consider how much we should accumulate as reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#34:1:A>
Not just you know keep on accumulating massive surpluses like ROV

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#35:1:A>
we have uh more than uh one point seven billion and the HDB six
hundred over billion million dollars and all the rest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#36:1:A>
Now with with a new introduction of uh levies of three thousand uh
foreign workers and sixty nine thousand of the maids

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#37:1:A>
the government is going to collect over a billion dollars every
year for levies alone

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#38:1:A>
Now why are we you know every time when there is a clamor for
subsidies for an essential investment we are grudging to say that we are
eating into our reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#39:1:A>
Even if it it so, so be it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#40:1:A>
It must be when we come to the field of education more people
should be subsidised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#41:1:A>
we are not not all the Singaporeans who send their children to
school are like all of us here who can afford it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#42:1:A>
Not forgetting Sir if I may repeat again

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#43:1:A>
here we have seven hundred fifty thousand people earning only eight
hundred dollars a month and then we have four hundred fifty thousand people
earning only one thousand dollars a month

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#44:1:A>
Now do you blame these people asking for more money to subsidise
their children in school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#45:1:A>
It is out of necessity rather than with the intention to squander
away the government reserves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#46:1:A>
We must do more for these people when these class of people clamor
for subsidies they should have our support because it is a genuine case for
want of support

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#47:1:A>
It is not a case of squandering away our reserves for consumption
purposes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#48:1:A>
which of course I would even object

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#49:1:A>
I am not one for welfarism but I am one that our people should be
subsidised in the field of education in the field of housing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#50:1:A>
I'm quite sure the government has got all the feedback

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#51:1:A>
These are the two fields that the government ought to look into

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#52:1:A>
The last election is a clear indication Singaporeans felt that with
the increasing fees and costs in education and health have burdened them
unnecessarily to the extent that it may be you know financially unable to
cope with the situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#53:1:A>
and uh I can give an exact example like it is like a millionaire
making a will

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#54:1:A>
A millionaire making a will to the children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#55:1:A>
but in the will it's said that the children can only make use of
the money when they reach the age of twenty one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#56:1:A>
but in the meantime they could hardly subsist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#57:1:A>
They could not even live now but the will said no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#58:1:A>
You can't make use of the money until you reach an age of twenty
one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#59:1:A>
Now why can't we use more of this money for the benefit of the
people in the field of education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#60:1:A>
Sir the next point Sir I would move to <unclear> word </unclear>
the question of the HDB upgrading Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#61:1:A>
Sir, the problem with you people is this you know you don't take

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#62:1:A>
you can't criticism from us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#63:1:A>
When I brought up the matter I merely explained the plight of a
number of people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#64:1:A>
Just I mentioned the fact that the plight of the retirees and the
plight of those low income group has got no money for the upgrading

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#65:1:A>
With that your reply is that well you are against upgrading

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#66:1:A>
but any way it is not for my decision

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#67:1:A>
and luckily Sir the money don't belong to any one of you here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#68:1:A>
It is the people money and if the people want upgrading you have to
give it to them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#69:1:A>
This is what a democratic society is all about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#70:1:A>
Sir so my question here is uh before you call for vote in respect
of housing board upgrading your flats will be improved and what would be the
improvement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#71:1:A>
And then whether whether it would be spread over a period of time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#72:1:A>
and whether in the long run you will have to there'll be no in
increase in the uh contribution of only ten percent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#73:1:A>
why not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#74:1:A>
Now it would appear that this' another pilot project just like uh
the you know kindergarten

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#75:1:A>
it's always pilot project

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#76:1:A>
You know you use the term pilot project so that you can back back
out any time you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#77:1:A>
Wonderful word to use this pilot project and you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#78:1:B>
Speaker Sir one note of clarification

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#79:1:B>
Will you allow me to question him on

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#80:1:C>
Mr Ling you allow

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#81:1:A>
Sir when the debate comes on the uh you know Ministry of uh
HDB

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#82:1:A>
here a lot of time to explain Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#83:1:A>
He'll have a lot of time to explain then Sir

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#84:1:B>
Mr Speaker he's moved uh cut under my head

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#85:1:A>
Mr Speaker Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#86:1:A>
Now Now Mr Speaker Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#87:1:A>
I I watched the television last night on a newsreel where they they
draw a comparison between the private housing estate to <unclear> word
</unclear> upgrading and that of HDB

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#88:1:A>
Sir I I think it's a very wrong comparison

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#89:1:A>
It has no relevance at all

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#90:1:A>
Sir you must always bear in mind one one factor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#91:1:A>
When a developer bought over old flats they have it upgraded with
profit in mind

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#92:1:A>
It is for sale so it is very different from HDB flats

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#93:1:A>
For all for all you know you can't sell to anybody you want to sell

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#94:1:A>
Yes that person must be qualified in the first place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#95:1:A>
You know the person must be qualified in the first place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#96:1:A>
and firstly yes but you cannot sell to anybody you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#97:1:A>
You have problem to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#98:1:B>
Mr Speaker a point of clarification

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#99:1:B>
I think he he must give me a chance to clarify otherwise he make a
fool of himself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#100:1:A>
Sir Sir I I won't Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#101:1:A>
Because even at the last debate I was not given a chance even to
to reply so why should I give him a chance to reply now Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#102:1:A>
I'm not going to give him a chance to reply

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#103:1:C>
Hey you continue then

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#104:1:A>
Yes Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#105:1:A>
Sir the the private sector they upgrade they sell to the people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#106:1:A>
Sir in in the in the case of HDB flat dwell uh dwellers Sir the
tenants there Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#107:1:A>
most of them would be stuck there for good because they would be
stuck there for good simply because of this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#108:1:A>
Sir because if they sell they will not be most of them will not be
able to buy another one because the prices keep going up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#109:1:A>
So it would be beyond the ability of most of the HDB flats to buy
that Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#110:1:A>
But you'll be happier I've to stay in the open air

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#111:1:A>
After you stay in open air you know is the is the community uh the
develop uh department willing to help these people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#112:1:A>
Sir the the next point Sir I I won't want to dwell on this Sir uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#113:1:A>
so the next point would be Sir Sir if I remember correctly Sir uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#114:1:A>
some time back before the introduction of the tax for PS uh that
telephone bill Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#115:1:A>
The government had wanted to give the first number of call free
and subsequent to that they will impose a you know for every call they will
impose a a a charge on that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#116:1:A>
Later on I believe a compromise came about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#117:1:A>
On the total bill the government impose a tax on the bill Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#118:1:A>
Now with the introduction of the time-based system Sir I'm
wondering why is the tax is still there Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#119:1:A>
The tax should have been abolished now because it's based on the
number of use of the call

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#120:1:A>
Therefore the tax should be abolished Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#121:1:A>
Thank you Sir

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#122:1:C>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#123:1:B>
Can I take a few minutes just to clarify two points

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#124:1:B>
Just five minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#125:1:B>
Just to illustrate that uh obviously uh Mr Ling hasn't read the
papers or try to make himself informed about HDB policies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#126:1:B>
First of all he said that uh an HDB owner cannot sell his flat
anybody except to those who qualify

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#127:1:B>
But the qualification or the eligibility is so widely defined that
more than ninety percent of Singaporeans qualify

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#128:1:B>
An HDB owner can sell a flat to any PR any citizen

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#129:1:B>
there's no limit on income there's no limit on ownership of
private private property

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#130:1:B>
So this means that an owner of HDB flat can sell his flat to
almost anybody in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#131:1:B>
There is no restriction of course it's true

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#132:1:B>
Only requirement is that the person stays in the flat that he
should not buy the HDB flat as an investment <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-051#X133:1:B>
Anybody can buy an HDB flat on a second-hand market even if he
owns a private property there's no limit on income and he can be a PR or a
citizen So this covers almost everybody in Singapore aright So he should get
this point first Secondly on upgrading Obviously he has not read I said
almost everybody If Mr Chiam is advocating that a single person should be
allowed to buy a five-room flat and I think he should bring it up we can
debate that point whether Singapore can afford it But I did not say everybody
in Singapore Mr Speaker Sir I said almost everybody In fact the market is so
wide that it should not affect the resale value Secondly on upgrading of
course all the facts are made available to those who are affected by
upgrading How much will be spent on the interior of the flat how much will be
spent within the block how much will be spent outside the block and not just
their sums but the exact items of upgrading Before they're asked to vote and
they're not just merely told in descriptive language There're plans there're
models there're firms So I think the member before he speaks on this should
make himself fully I mean he should inform himself and if he doesn't know
about it he should put a question maybe we can gain the clarification but he
should not make a speech without even taking the trouble to find out the
facts </X> </I>
