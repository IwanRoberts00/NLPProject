<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#222:1:C>
and this colleague was saying how they were

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#223:1:C>
They always carry a haversack and a water bottle

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#224:1:A>
You have a water bottle

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#225:1:B>
The yellow pump

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#226:1:C>
So is the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#227:1:C>
It gets red when activated

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#228:1:A>
Wait wait aiyah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#229:1:A>
No lah it's not as to the content right

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#230:1:C>
So there was in the New New Paper not in the new not not the
Straits Times

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#231:1:C>
I was looking through it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#232:1:B>
I don't know whether I I saw it in the New Paper

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#233:1:C>
It's about this East Coast Park thing right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#234:1:A>
How many got arrested

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#235:1:C>
Arrested uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#236:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#237:1:C>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#238:1:C>
Really

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#239:1:A>
He's saying But what's wrong uh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#240:1:C>
Why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#241:1:A>
Because they were nudists

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#242:1:B>
Because the the undercover cops went there

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#243:1:C>
And they got molested and they got fed up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#244:1:B>
Molested propositioned

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#245:1:A>
But why did they go there to get molested and then and then
arrest people

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#246:1:C>
After hour recreation and then they were not satisfied

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#247:1:B>
They they can't arrest them if they were not molested

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#248:1:A>
Uhm uhm so they must like open themselves to

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#249:1:C>
But it's okay what I mean unless there are rape cases
reported uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#250:1:C>
Were there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#251:1:C>
Were there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#252:1:A>
Not loud enough

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#253:1:B>
Rape cases

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#254:1:C>
No right no no males got raped there right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#255:1:A>
I thought they are quite you know mild people

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#256:1:C>
I told you about my encounter with them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#257:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#258:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#263:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#264:1:B>
I don't remember

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#265:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#266:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#269:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#270:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#271:1:C>
Uh the other end from here uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#272:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#273:1:C>
I was cycling off the track you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#274:1:C>
There's one part where the cycling track is quite quite far away
from the uh floor line

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#275:1:A>
Uhm Because of the reclaimed land there lor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#276:1:C>
The last <unclear> word </unclear> the last drain

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#277:1:C>
The last drain you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#278:1:C>
There are several drains

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#279:1:C>
Uh the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#280:1:A>
Uhm <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#281:1:C>
canal canal's going to the sea

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#282:1:A>
Uhm okay

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#283:1:C>
The last drain before you reach the end

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#284:1:C>
There's one path <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#285:1:C>
There you know cycling there it's evening time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#286:1:C>
I I don't know what was going on actually

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#287:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#288:1:C>
Just noticed a lot of males uh walking alone

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#289:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#290:1:C>
you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#291:1:C>
So I thought there could be some kind of illegal activity going

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#292:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#293:1:C>
I had no idea what exactly uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#294:1:C>
I was enjoying the place because it's nice ya nice bumpy areas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#295:1:C>
I like bumpy areas

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#296:1:A>
Uhm that's why he needs a

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#297:1:C>
I like bumpy <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#298:1:A>
That's why he needs a that rocking woman

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#299:1:C>
Uhm ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#300:1:C>
Then there's one part where I came across two naked men

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#301:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#302:1:C>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#303:1:C>
Probably they heard me coming along uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#304:1:C>
So they were both standing up

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#305:1:C>
One was looking very shy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#306:1:C>
The other man was overweight

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#307:1:C>
Looks like a typical towkay guy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#308:1:C>
Doesn't look like a gay at all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#309:1:C>
Towkay guy completely naked doing stretching exercises with a huge
tummy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#310:1:A>
So all you saw was

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#311:1:B>
Where where where where

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#312:1:B>
Where were they stretching exercises

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#313:1:A>
Wait wait wait

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#314:1:A>
You actually saw his front nuh or or he was facing the sea and

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#315:1:C>
I came from behind him so he was doing stretching exercises

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#316:1:B>
Where was he doing the stretching

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#317:1:A>
The beach is it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#318:1:C>
They're both looking very self-conscious

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#319:1:C>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#320:1:C>
Where oh where

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#321:1:B>
On the beach itself

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#322:1:C>
Uh not that near the beach rather nearer the cycling track

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#323:1:B>
Uh oh ya the casuarina trees or

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#324:1:C>
Ya uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#325:1:A>
Uh so at least not totally unshielded or anything

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#326:1:C>
But they were so near the that the crisscrossing tracks
inside lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#327:1:C>
You know they're so near the tracks not discreet at all and uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#328:1:A>
Why must they be discreet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#329:1:A>
Okay anyway

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#330:1:C>
They were very self-conscious lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#331:1:C>
Obviously not real

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#332:1:A>
Maybe still looking for new khakis uh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#333:1:C>
Not real exercising lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#334:1:C>
Just or he could be warming up but I doubt it lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#335:1:C>
It looks more like you know very self-conscious and for the sake
of doing something else just do some stretching exercise

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#336:1:A>
Maybe just to pretend

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#337:1:C>
To this huge <unclear> word </unclear> tummy and they
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#338:1:A>
That's that's when you're very near them lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#339:1:A>
if not horrible

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#340:1:C>
I cycled past them lah while he was doing this stretching
exercise to the huge tummy and the huge erection

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#341:1:A>
Wah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#342:1:C>
And the right guy was trying to look away looking natural

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#343:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#344:1:C>
A much smaller guy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#345:1:A>
When you said encounter

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#346:1:A>
I thought there were something more to it like what happened to
you

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#347:1:C>
I wanted to stay and watch but I thought it's not very
decorous

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#348:1:B>
Can watch what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#349:1:B>
New New Paper has said there're some people stay there and watch

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#350:1:C>
Can uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#351:1:C>
Can bring video camera along uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#352:1:A>
No lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#353:1:C>
Why not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#354:1:C>
A you want extra income right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#355:1:A>
They like to be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#356:1:A>
No lah I wouldn't be so mean

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#357:1:C>
Why so mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#358:1:C>
Some of these people are exhibitionists uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#359:1:A>
Unless they are actually what

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#360:1:C>
I mean they stay so close to the track then then they allow
people to watch them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#361:1:A>
Actually uh what are they doing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-008#362:1:A>
Maybe this' their way of you know attracting new blood lah right
