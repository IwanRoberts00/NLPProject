<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#5:1>
THE Basic Education in Skills Training ( Best) programme for unskilled
workers to learn primary level English and Mathematics may be phased out
within five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#6:1>
By 1998, 180,000 workers, or 80 per cent who need such training, would
have gone through it, said the Senior Minister of State ( Education) Dr Tay
Eng Soon yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#7:1>
He urged the 45,000 others who still lack basic education to sign up
for Best courses soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#8:1>
Dr Tay said the Institute of Technical Education ( ITE) had decided to
do a comprehensive review of its worker education programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#9:1>
He is concerned that despite the growing number of trained workers
here, Singapore has dropped from 14th to 15th place in availability of
trained workers in countries.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#10:1>
" We must reverse this.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#11:1>
In fact, we should aim for 12th or even 10th place," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#12:1>
The rankings were determined by Business Environment Risk
Intelligence ( Beri) a Washington-based risk analysis consultancy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#13:1>
" Since investors study Beri's findings, this will influence whether
they will come here or not, especially for those in high technology
industries," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#14:1>
Dr Tay spoke at the 10th anniversary celebration of the Best
programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#15:1>
It was also the graduation ceremony for those who had completed the
Best programme and the 'Workers' Improvement Through Secondary Education (
Wise) programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#16:1>
Wise teaches secondary level English and Mathematics.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#17:1>
Dr Tay said he hoped the review committee would consult Beri when
setting training targets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#18:1>
Dr Law Song Seng, ITE's director, will chair the committee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#19:1>
Its members will come from the National Productivity Board, Skills
Development Fund, Economic Development Board, National Trades Union Congress
and employers' groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#20:1>
They will chart new directions for the next five years or more,
examine the programmes' relevance and recommend improvements.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#21:1>
Dr Tay said the review is timely as regional competition for
investments increases.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#22:1>
He said: " Our lowly educated, unskilled workers are becoming exposed
and vulnerable.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#23:1>
Their counterparts in the region are willing to work for half or one
third of their salaries.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#24:1>
They will lose their unskilled jobs to them".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#25:1>
But if workers improve their education and skills, " the better jobs
will come to them and their real incomes can grow.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#26:1>
Continuing education and training is not a matter of choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#27:1>
It could be a matter of their survival".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#28:1>
He said later that he was concerned about workers not going for
training.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#29:1>
" They say they have no time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#30:1>
I think they are being complacent...

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#31:1>
we want to push them a bit harder," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#32:1>
Citizens and permanent residents with less than primary education
formed 36 per cent of the population in 1980 but 31 per cent in 1990.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#33:1>
About 130,000 workers or 8 per cent of the original target group of
225,000 unskilled workers have attended at least one Best module since it
started in 1983 and about 46,000 had completed all four.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#34:1>
Of this number, 15,000 went on to higher level courses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#35:1>
A 191 survey also showed that nine out of 10 students found the Best
course useful in their work and eight in 10 employers agreed this was so.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#36:1>
Dr Tay presented awards to C K Tang Limited, GM Singapore, the Port
of Singapore Authority, Public Utilities Board and Singapore Bus Service for
supporting Best.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#37:1>
The Housing Board, Motorola Electronics, National Semiconductor
Manufacturer Singapore, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Boon Lay PAP
Community Foundation Education Centre received special awards for supporting
Best and Wise.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#38:1>
Teachers and former Best students who went on to get higher
qualifications also received awards.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#39:1>
Madam Gait Bib, 40, a booking attendant for sports facilities: " I
went for Best classes in 1983.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#40:1>
I went on to do the Wise programme and GCE N level in English.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#41:1>
If not for all these programmes, I would not be able to get this
job".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#42:1>
THE STRAITS TIMES Restaurants to discuss punctuality incentives By
Cephah Tan DISCOUNT packages for hosts who start Chinese wedding dinners on
time - these and other incentives to promote punctuality will be discussed by
150 restaurant owners and managers tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#43:1>
For the first time, a forum is being held at which participants from
hotel food outlets and Chinese restaurants will discuss incentives for hosts
who support the punctuality drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#44:1>
Chinese wedding banquets have gained a bad reputation for starting as
late as two hours after the stipulated time because of habitual latecomers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#45:1>
At the forum, to be held at the Hotel Equatorial, participants who
have managed to get dinners going earlier - between one and 1.5 hours after
the stipulated time - will share their tips on how they do it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#46:1>
Mr Justin Chia, the executive director of the Restaurant Association
of Singapore ( RAS), said: 'The main objective of the forum is to work out an
action plan for our industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#47:1>
We hope that this plan will be adopted by all restaurants".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#48:1>
The forum is being organised by the Singapore Hotel Association (
SHA), RAS and Singapore Restaurants Merchants Association.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#49:1>
Suggestions offered there will be passed on to the National
Punctuality Drive 1993 working committee and will be presented at a national
forum on Community Actions for Punctuality.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#50:1>
The three-month drive, which will be launched by President Wee Kim
Wee on July 31, is aimed primarily at getting Chinese wedding dinners and
National Day and Seventh Moon Festival dinners to begin on the dot.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#51:1>
According to the National Punctuality Drive 1993 working committee, a
survey carried out last year showed that about 61 per cent of restaurants
started their dinners at 8.45 pm, compared with 9 pm the year before.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#52:1>
The RAS' Mr Chia said that despite the slight improvement in starting
times, restaurants could serve meals on time only if all guests were
punctual.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#53:1>
He said: " It is unproductive to have staff waiting for everyone to
arrive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#54:1>
If they can finish their work early, they can go home early".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#55:1>
The forum is part of a series organised by various groups picked by
the working committee of the punctuality drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#56:1>
So far, one other forum has been held.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#57:1>
Organised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (
SCCCI) and the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations ( SFCCA), it
threw up these suggestions:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#58:1>
START dinners promptly, but allow latecomers to tuck in later.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#59:1>
REWARD early birds with lucky draws or gifts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#60:1>
IMPOSE a punctuality fine on latecomers, and give the money to
charity.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#61:1>
TELEPHONE guests on the day of the dinner and remind them to be
early.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#62:1>


<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#63:1>
PRINT the punctuality drive's rooster mascot on all invitation cards
to remind guests that the function will start on the dot. </I>

<h> No grace period for owners who sublet whole flat illegally HDB
says they 'must take immediate action to rectify situation' </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#65:2>
By Cephah Tan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#66:2>
THE Housing Board will not give owners who sublet their flats
illegally a grace period to allow the owners' tenants to find alternative
accommodation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#67:2>
An HDB spokesman, in reply to a Straits Times query, said: " Lessees
who have let out the whole flat must take immediate action to rectify the
situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#68:2>
They must stop letting out the whole flat and must physically occupy
the flat.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#69:2>
The HDB reply has dimmed the hopes of many jittery owners and
sub-tenants who were warned again last Friday to stop illegal subletting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#70:2>
House agents who claim that there are at least 3000 flats being
sublet illegally, said many tenants would have problems finding a home so
quickly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#71:2>
Agents said some owners had asked them to terminate their rent as
they were now more afraid of the harsh penalties after the HDB warned of
stiff action last week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#72:2>
The board also said that 40 people lost their flats and another 80
were fined as much as
&dollar;30,000 after being caught for subletting flats illegally.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#73:2>
The offenders were also banned from buying and renting an HDB flat
for five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#74:2>
The HDB has said it would continue to employ private investigators to
nab culprits.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#75:2>
It would also report them to the Inland Revenue Authority of
Singapore to check whether owners have paid tax for rental income.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#76:2>
A house agent, who claims to have handled 300 rental cases within the
past few years, said: " Illegal rental of flats is an open secret.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#77:2>
" It's been around for years and people have taken it for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#78:2>
But HDB seems to be more serious now.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#79:2>
A few owners rang me up saying they'd like to cancel their agreement
with tenants".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#80:2>
The HDB said flat owners could rent out their rooms but they
themselves must occupy at least one of the rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#81:2>
It added that they should not buy an HDB flat if they do not need it
in the first place as they would be depriving others of housing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#82:2>
Some owners argued that they were not depriving others of
accommodation as they were willing to rent out their flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#83:2>
They had bought one because they needed it in the long-run.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#84:2>
But because of short-term commitments, they had to live with their
family members and relatives elsewhere, they said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#85:2>
They gave reasons like having to look after their sick parents,
moving in with relatives who babysit their children but who do not want to
move out, and living with relatives so that their children could attend
nearby day-care centres or kindergartens.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#86:2>
So, they would rather rent out their flat to earn some income during
their short absence, than leave it vacant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#87:2>
Said one man " We didn't know that renting the whole flat was
illegal.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#88:2>
My parents rented out their flat and are staying with us so that we
can look after them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#89:2>
Besides they can make some money.' Another owner, a secretary, said: "
We are now living at my mother-in-law's flat because my son attends a
kindergarten near her flat.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#90:2>
There isn't a kindergarten in our estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#91:2>
But when my son grows up, we will shift back".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#92:2>
House agents said those who took up the apartments were mostly
foreign workers, permanent residents and foreign students.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#93:2>
The rest were Singaporeans, including people who failed to obtain a
flat, singles, those waiting for their flats to be built or those whose flats
were under renovation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#94:2>
House agents felt that the board should legalise subletting of whole
flats as long as owners paid tax for their rental income.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#95:2>
One agent wondered whether the HDB could provide alternative
accommodation for the sub-tenants if they were evicted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#96:2>
He believed that most foreign workers and employers who provided
housing for staff would not be able to afford private housing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#97:2>
A reader who wrote to The Straits Times Forum Page yesterday said the
HDB and government departments should formulate housing plans according to
the needs of foreign workers and permanent residents too.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#98:2>
They could start by keeping a register of their addresses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#99:2>
Said one house agent: " There are thousands of foreign workers
occupying such flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#100:2>
There are Malaysians working in factories and hotels, foreign
students, Hongkong immigrants, Indian and Chinese professionals".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#101:2>
In reply, the HDB spokesman pointed out that tenants could continue
living in the same flat together with the owner, but not occupy all the
bedrooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#102:2>
Each case judged on merit · ELDERLY owners can sublet their flat and
live with their children elsewhere if they are extremely ill and require
constant medical attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#103:2>
They must have good reasons like these.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#104:2>
But they cannot rent it out just because they want to live with
their children or grandchildren.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#105:2>
THE board may consider allowing owners to sublet their flat if they
and their families are required to live in company quarters elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#106:2>
OWNERS can let the whole flat when they and their families live
abroad because of their jobs or studies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#107:2>
The board said as each case is considered on its own merit,
Permission is granted on a case by case basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#108:2>
It is also subject to periodical review.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#109:2>
Owners must get approval from HDB branch offices before subletting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#110:2>
The HDB itself rents out whole flats under two arrangements:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#111:2>
UNDER its integrated non-citizen housing scheme, permanent residents
and non-citizens with professional employment passes and skilled work permits
can rent a whole flat from the Housing Board. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#X112:2>
But the applications must be supported by the Finance Ministry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#X113:2>


<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#X114:2>
COMPANIES in the construction industry, engineering and
manufacturing can also rent whole flats for their unskilled workers from the
Housing Board.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-008#X115:2>
Their applications must be supported by the Economic Development
Board or the Construction Industry Development Board. </X> </I>
