After a big meal your digestive system may not be able to
process the excess acid produced in your stomach

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#2:1:A>
Heartburn what appears as a minor problem can be the first symptoms
of more serious health problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#3:1:A>
What happens when you lose your voice because of a paralysed vocal
cord

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#4:1:A>
Your voice what can you do if you lose it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#5:1:A>
Some of us use it more often than anyone else does

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#6:1:A>
Others abuse it yet all of us need it our voice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#7:1:A>
It comes so naturally that we hardly think twice when we use it but
the moment we lose it that's when we will miss it most

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#8:1:A>
Seventy-five year old Madam Lim had one such close encounter just
this June

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#9:1:A>
The experience was very trying for the out-going Madam Lim who used
to enjoy shopping chatting over the phone and even over-night mahjong
sessions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#10:1:A>
But all these had to go when she started losing her voice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#11:1:A>
But not knowing what the real cause was Madam Lim kept drinking
water and taking cough medication in the hope that her voice would return
someday

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#12:1:A>
Little did she realise that her voice loss had nothing to do with
her sore throat but everything to do with her paralysed vocal cord

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#13:1:A>
Madam Lim was diagnosed with cancer of the lungs in June this year
and within days she started to lose her voice as the tumor was sitting on her
nerves paralysing her left vocal cord

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#14:1:A>
But for the man on the street like her how could she have known
better

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#15:1:A>
In a normal vocal cord the two vocal folds would meet in the
mid-line of the throat region and when air flows from the lungs to the vocal
cords the vibrations would generate the sounds for voice production

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#16:1:A>
If one of the vocal folds is malfunctioning there would be a gap
between the two vocal folds causing difficulty in speech

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#17:1:A>
As if struggling with a hoarse throat and battling with her lung
cancer isn't enough she chokes on her every drink

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#18:1:A>
New adjustments it almost seems too much for Madam Lim to cope

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#19:1:A>
Madam Lim went for the scan the results confirm that her left vocal
fold was indeed malfunctioning and she needed the operation to correct her
paralysed cord

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#20:1:A>
Though she resisted the idea of having to undergo an operation her
fear of going mute won her over

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#21:1:A>
But not only was the operation simple and fuss free Madam Lim could
even choose her voice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#22:1:A>
So far <unclear> word </unclear> has a success rate of about
seventy to eighty per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#23:1:A>
The operation which takes place under local anesthesia simply
attains results that are too good to be true

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#24:1:A>
A simple procedure that has brought confidence and meaning back to
life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#25:1:A>
Madam Lim has since regained her active lifestyle and was even able
to celebrate her seventy-fifth birthday with dignity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#26:1:A>
Regurgitation of gastric juices in the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#27:1:A>
Who are those more lightly to suffer from heartburn find out after
the break

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#28:1:A>
Everyone eats but not everyone can experience the joy of eating

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#29:1:A>
Some may encounter indigestion after a big feast while others
experience heartburn because of a reflux of gastric juices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#30:1:A>
Heartburn what causes this condition

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#31:1:A>
Patient's digestive tract will usually feel bloated after eating
too much you feel as though there is a lot of gas in your stomach

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#32:1:A>
This results in a pain when you feel as if your heart is burning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#33:1:A>
This is how the term heartburn is coined when you have heartburn
you will feel as if the area around your heart is burning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#34:1:A>
A slimy mucus-like substance protects our gastric walls this
substance prevents any discomfort caused by the acidic gastric juices in our
stomach

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#35:1:A>
The esophagus which is link to our gastric tract is more likely to
be affected by gastric juices since it is not protected by any slimy
substance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#36:1:A>
This results in the burning feeling from heartburn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#37:1:A>
According to Dr Cheng more and more Singaporeans are suffering from
heartburn this is mostly due to our diet and way of life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#38:1:A>
It could be that Singaporeans are eating too much oily fatty food
like burgers and other similar kinds of greasy processed food

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#39:1:A>
Eating too well can result in obesity this may also cause heartburn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#40:1:A>
Another reason is that patients are more concerned about their
health these days and to go to the doctor whenever they feel uncomfortable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#41:1:A>
Because of this more cases of heartburn are discovered now than was
compared with before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#42:1:A>
We are also beginning to understand more about heartburn and this
aids in diagnosing the condition

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#43:1:A>
Foods and fluids must first pass through the esophagus or gullet to
get to the gastric

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#44:1:A>
The lower end of the gullet is the main area where the
regurgitation of the gastric juices occurs and people who are over-weight
most of the abdominal is taken up by fat this pushes the stomach hard-up
against the diaphragm so that the acid produce by the stomach is squeezed
into the gullet

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#45:1:A>
When we eat excessively the resulting gastric pressure is also more
likely to force the gastric juices into the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#46:1:A>
As we age the stomach muscles would be more relaxed and less taut

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#47:1:A>
This is part of the natural aging process

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#48:1:A>
When this occurs when our stomach walls and lining are in relaxed
state and if there is an increase in gastric pressure the pressure would
force the food and gastric juices back up into the gullet or the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#49:1:A>
Then the question is what causes the increase in gastric pressure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#50:1:A>
As we get older the abdomen grows bigger and this would result in a
pressure that which pushes the food from the gastric upward to the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#51:1:A>
As the population ages the number of heartburn patients increases

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#52:1:A>
How is heartburn treated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#53:1:A>
Usually the patients would work out a way themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#54:1:A>
They may consult a family doctor and take the medication prescribed
or they may buy some over-the-counter pain-killers or medicine for their
gastric pain and this can be quite effective

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#55:1:A>
If the heartburn occurs often and causes a lot of pain or if we
cannot eat because it causes too much pain and you lose weight you must
consult the doctor

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#56:1:A>
A patient can find out how serious his or her condition is through
a gastric endoscopy examination

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#57:1:A>
There are differing degrees of heartburn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#58:1:A>
When there is a regurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus
slight inflammation will occur and the esophagus will be slightly swollen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#59:1:A>
Further stimulation of the esophagus especially at the lower end
will result in ulcers and bleeding

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#60:1:A>
In severe cases of heartburn the self-structure around of the
esophagus will start to ulcerate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#61:1:A>
In the long run the esophagus will modify its inner lining so that
it's similar to what we have in our stomach to protect itself from
stimulation of the gastric juices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#62:1:A>
This is called <unclear> word </unclear> esophagus however we don't
know who will develop this condition

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#63:1:A>
Some people may not develop <unclear> word </unclear> esophagus at
all while others may stand a higher chance of getting cancer once they have
<unclear> word </unclear> esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#64:1:A>
There is about a seventy per cent chance of getting cancer when
<unclear> word </unclear> develops

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#65:1:A>
So what may appear an inconsequential ailment can actually be the
beginning of severe illnesses

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#66:1:A>
Not everyone recognises the symptoms of heartburn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#67:1:A>
This condition can affect anyone without warning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#68:1:A>
When you feel a sour taste in your mouth it indicates a
regurgitation of gastric juices into the esophagus and the mouth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#69:1:A>
This may mean that the condition of the reflux is quite serious

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#70:1:A>
It is even more severe if the gastric juices irritate your throat
and cause asthma

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#71:1:A>
Over the counter antacids can only relieve the symptoms of
heartburn but they are unable to do anything about the slackening of the
stomach muscles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#72:1:A>
The only way to prevent the reflux of gastric juices is to change
your eating habits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#73:1:A>
We should cut down on the amount of food we eat since the problem
always occurs after eating too much

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#74:1:A>
Also do not lie down immediately after a meal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#75:1:A>
This means no supper because we usually go to bed right after
supper

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#76:1:A>
For those who cannot prevent heartburn caused by the slackening of
stomach muscles one way of reducing the regurgitation of gastric juices is to
prop themselves up with one or two pillows when they sleep

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#77:1:A>
When the upper half of the body is in a higher position the gastric
juices are less lightly to flow upwards to the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#78:1:A>
In addition we should avoid food like coffee tea alcohol and
chocolate these foods tend to cause discomfort in patients

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#79:1:A>
other methods may include losing weight and not wearing clothes
that are too tight-fitting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#80:1:A>
Clothes that are too tight at the abdomen will tend to push the
food from the stomach up the esophagus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#81:1:A>
One more thing people should be aware of is that the burning
sensation caused by heartburn is similar to the symptoms of a heart-attack

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#82:1:A>
This presents a danger to patients who are unable to differentiate
between heartburn and a heart-attack

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#83:1:A>
If a person feels uncomfortable when he is lying down while
watching television he is most probably suffering from heartburn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#84:1:A>
Heart attacks usually occur when the patient is over-working his or
herself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#85:1:A>
In this case having sufficient rest will help ease the condition

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#86:1:A>
A heart-attack usually last three to five minutes and beyond that
the condition is considered very dangerous

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#87:1:A>
Heartburn may last for up to two or three hours

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#88:1:A>

Miss Gunes Sinnatamby has been a primary school teacher for forty
years and in all that time her house has been home to no less than twenty
students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#97:2:B>
They come from all over not just for a meal or for remedial work
but to stay over for months and even years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#98:2:B>
And in the process Miss Sinnatamby taught them things she never
would have been able to do in her classroom

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#99:2:B>
Our story begins with how she helped a nine-year-old boy from
Peiying Primary School where she teaches

<ICE-SIN:S2B-028#100:2:B>
